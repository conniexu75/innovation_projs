In the fasted state, the mRNA levels of all lipogenic enzymes were consistently low in both wild-type andSREBP-1 −/− mice. However, the absence of SREBP-1 severely impaired the marked induction of hepatic mRNAs of fatty acid synthetic genes, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase, that was observed upon refeeding in the wild-type mice. Furthermore, the refeeding responses of other lipogenic enzymes, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and S14 mRNAs, were completely abolished inSREBP-1 −/− mice. In contrast, mRNA levels for cholesterol biosynthetic genes were elevated in the refedSREBP-1 −/− livers accompanied by an increase in nuclear SREBP-2 protein. When fed a high carbohydrate diet for 14 days, the mRNA levels for these lipogenic enzymes were also strikingly lower in SREBP-1 −/− mice than those in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the induction of lipogenesis but not cholesterol biosynthesis in liver when excess energy by carbohydrates is consumed.

However, biosynthetic pathways for cholesterol and fatty acids are under distinct and separate regulation (for a review, see Ref. 1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In contrast to cholesterol synthesis, which is tightly regulated by a feedback system to maintain cellular cholesterol levels, fatty acid synthesis is driven primarily by the availability of carbohydrates and the actions of hormones such as insulin. Despite these different patterns of regulation, recent evidence suggests that both biosynthetic pathways can be controlled by a common family of transcription factors designated sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs)1 (reviewed in Ref.2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). SREBPs belong to a large class of transcription factors containing basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper. Unlike other members of this class, SREBPs are synthesized as membrane-bound precursors that require cleavage by a two-step proteolytic process in order to release their amino-terminal basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper-containing domain into the nucleus to activate their target genes in a sterol-regulated manner (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of SREBPs is that they have a dual binding specificity to both classic palindromic E-boxes and nonpalindromic sterol regulatory elements (SREs) (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

The SREBP target genes include enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis: HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase, squalene synthase, and SREBP-2 itself, each of which contains a SRE or SRE-like sequence in its promoter (5Yokoyama C.

The SREBPs also bind to regulatory sequences in the promoters of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (3Kim J.B.

Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To date, three SREBPs have been identified: SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, produced from a single gene through the use of alternate promoters, and SREBP-2 from a separate gene (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). The rat homologue of SREBP-1c, named ADD1, was cloned independently as a protein that binds to E-boxes and presumably promotes adipocyte differentiation (14Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). All actively growing cultured cells so far studied produce predominantly SREBP-1a and SREBP-2, whereas most organs including liver from adult animals predominantly synthesize SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 (15Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). All three SREBPs are capable of activating each of the known target genes, although with differing efficiencies. SRBP-1c is weaker than SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 due to its shorter transactivation domain (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 17Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the distinct roles of each SREBP isoform in vivo, transgenic mice that overexpress truncated, active nuclear forms of human SREBP-1a, -1c, or -2 in liver were produced and characterized (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 19Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different SREBP-overexpressing transgenic animals showed a different pattern of increase in hepatic synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol and/or fatty acids. These data suggest that the SREBP-1 isoforms are more selective in activating fatty acid biosynthetic genes, while SREBP-2 is more specific for controlling cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism for the relative specificity of each transcription factor is not currently known. Liver, the principal organ of lipogenesis as well as cholesterogenesis, is responsible for production of triglycerides from excess dietary carbohydrate. A high carbohydrate diet induces mRNA levels for a group of genes designated lipogenic enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 20Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Goodridge A.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This transcriptional induction of lipogenic enzymes is most prominently seen during fasting-refeeding treatment to rodents. When mice are fasted, lipogenesis declines. Refeeding fasted animals with a high carbohydrate diet causes marked induction of the mRNA levels of lipogenic enzymes to levels higher than pretreatment, which is often referred to as “overshooting.” These lipogenic enzymes include not only genes for fatty acid biosynthesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), but also glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase for triglyceride synthesis; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme, which provide the NADPH for reductive biosynthesis; and ATP citrate lyase, which produces acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and liver-type pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic pathway. Each of these lipogenic genes is known to be regulated at a transcriptional level and has been shown to be activated in the livers of SREBP transgenic mice (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The distinct regulation of SREBP-1 and -2 has been observed in the physiological response of mouse liver to nutritional change. The amounts of SREBP-1c protein and mRNA, but not those of SREBP-2, dramatically increased after refeeding fasted mice in a similar manner to lipogenic enzyme mRNAs (24Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing SREBP-1c, even when fasted, mimicked the refeeding state of ACC, FAS, and SCD mRNA levels in wild-type animals (24Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that a high level expression of nuclear SREBP-1c in the refed state could be responsible for induction of lipogenic enzymes. However, due to the artificial overexpression of SREBPs in the transgenic mice, we cannot conclude whether SREBP-1 is a physiological regulator for transcription of lipogenic enzymes. The disruption of the SREBP-1 gene caused partial embryonic lethality, with only 10–30% of expected homozygous mice surviving (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the initial analysis of the surviving SREBP-1 −/− mice, there were no significant changes in hepatic mRNA levels of ACC, FAS, and SCD, while genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were activated (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, the study was performed in the nonfasted state of a regular diet, which is not a favorable condition for lipogenesis. In the current study, the SREBP-1 knockout mice were used to re-estimate the effects of the absence of functional SREBP-1 protein on expression of the lipogenic enzymes in an inducible situation (fasting-refeeding treatment or prolonged high carbohydrate diet). After these dietary manipulations, wild-type mice showed marked elevation in all lipogenic genes, while those of SREBP-1 −/− mice remained suppressed, suggesting that SREBP-1 is crucial for nutritional induction of hepatic lipogenic enzymes. Mice were housed in colony cages with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Mice homozygous for disrupted SREBP-1 gene allele B (SREBP-1 −/−) were prepared as described previously (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and used for the current studies with age- (30–33 weeks) and sex-matched wild-type animals on the same genetic background (hybrid between C57Black/6J and 129 Sv/Ev). For the fasting and refeeding study, groups of four femaleSREBP-1 −/− and wild-type mice were set up. All animals had been fed on a regular chow diet until the fasting and refeeding treatment started. For the refeeding group, animals were fasted 24 h (from 22:00 to 22:00) and then refed with a high carbohydrate/fat-free diet for 12 h (22:00–10:00). This fasting and refeeding cycle was repeated three times at 3-day intervals for the refeeding group to adapt the animals to the dietary manipulation. The final fasting and refeeding cycle was performed after a 1-week interval. The mean percentage increase in the body weights during the refeeding was 8% for wild-type and SREBP-1 −/−mice. For the fasting group, the animals were fasted for 24 h (10:00–10:00). Both groups were sacrificed between 10:00 and 10:30. Regular laboratory diet and high carbohydrate/fat-free diet (70% sucrose and 20% casein) were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse upstream stimulatory factor (USF)-1 and USF-2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids were measured by enzymatic assays using commercial kits (Determiner TC, TG, and NEFA, respectively, Kyowa Medics, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The content of cholesterol and triglycerides in liver was measured as described previously (26Yokode M. Hammer R.E. Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1990; 250: 1273-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described except for the use of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) instead of Pefabloc (27Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The samples of 20-μg nuclear protein were subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit IgG against mouse SREBP-1 (amino acids 32–250) (18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) or against mouse SREBP-2 (amino acids 32–250) (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked goat IgG against rabbit IgG and the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was extracted from mouse livers and parametrial adipose tissues using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Equal aliquots of total RNA from mice in each group were pooled (total 15 μg), subjected to formalin-denatured agarose electrophoresis, and transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blot hybridization was performed with the cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]CTP (6000 Ci/mmol) using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA probes for mouse S14, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, liver-type pyruvate kinase, PPARα, acyl-CoA oxidase, cytochrome P-450 4A2 (CYP4A2), and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (36B4) were prepared by cloning reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products from mouse liver RNA into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen). The primers used for polymerase chain reaction were as follows: for rat ATP citrate lyase, 5′ primer was ACATCTGTACCACCTCAGCCATCCAGAA and 3′ primer was GCAGTGGCGTCCACCTTGGCCGCCA (28Elshourbagy N.A.

The resulting bands were quantified by exposure of the filters to BAS2000 with BAStation software (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and the results were normalized to the signal generated from 36B4 mRNA. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection studies were carried out with cells plated on 12-well plates as described previously (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) except that SuperFect (Qiagen) was used for transfection according to the manufacturer's protocol. The indicated amount of each expression plasmid was transfected simultaneously with 0.25 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid (pFAS-Luc (16Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar)) and 0.5 μg of a control pTKβ-gal reference plasmid (Promega). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was adjusted to 3 μg/well with vector DNA. The amount of luciferase activity in transfectants was normalized to the amount of β-galactosidase activity as measured by a kit (Promega). To show that SREBP-1 controls transcriptional regulation of hepatic lipogenic enzymes, we hypothesized that the absence of SREBP-1 should cause an impaired response of lipogenic enzyme mRNAs in the liver to refeeding. To test this hypothesis, we performed a fasting and refeeding treatment on SREBP-1 −/− and wild-type mice. Table I shows the phenotypic characteristics of both groups in the study. The mean percentage increase in body weight during the refeeding was the same (8%) between refed wild-type and SREBP-1 −/−mice. The livers from both refed groups were significantly enlarged, which is customarily observed in refed rodents. Cholesterol content in the liver was significantly higher inSREBP-1 −/− mice than in wild-type mice in both fasted and refed states, which is consistent with the previous report on the nonfasted SREBP-1 −/− mice (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The fasting-refeeding treatment decreased liver triglyceride content inSREBP-1 −/− mice, while no change was detected in the livers of wild-type mice. In the wild-type animals, plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels were elevated by fasting and suppressed by refeeding. In the SREBP-1 −/− mice, the suppression of plasma NEFA by refeeding seemed more pronounced than that observed in wild-type mice. There was no significant difference between SREBP-1 −/− and wild-type mice in blood sugar levels in either nutritional state.Table IPhenotypic characteristics of wild-type and homozygous (SREBP-1 −/− ) mice for the disrupted SREBP-1 geneGenotypeFastedRefedWild typeSREBP-1 −/−Wild typeSREBP-1 −/−Body weight (g)24.8 ± 0.9026.6 ± 0.8128.5 ± 2.622.3 ± 0.46#$Liver/body weight0.036 ± 0.0020.036 ± 0.0020.064 ± 0.006**0.055 ± 0.007$$Liver cholesterol (mg/g)2.0 ± 0.0373.8 ± 0.39*3.4 ± 0.398.4 ± 0.62###$$Liver triglyceride (mg/g)43.5 ± 6.561.0 ± 1.848.3 ± 8.730.0 ± 5.1$$Plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)60.7 ± 3.541.0 ± 4.6*63.0 ± 7.840.3 ± 3.3##Plasma triglyceride (mg/dl)59.0 ± 4.746.9 ± 4.984.4 ± 9.1*36.0 ± 2.0###Plasma NEFAaNonesterified fatty acid.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows immunoblot analysis of SREBPs in liver nuclear extracts. In the fasted state, the mature form of SREBP-1 in the liver nuclear extracts pooled from wild-type mice was barely detectable, while refeeding dramatically increased the mature protein level. The aberrant protein of ∼40 kDa derived from the disrupted SREBP-1 gene in the knockout mice (indicated by anasterisk in Fig. 1) was also markedly enhanced by refeeding. This aberrant protein consists of the N-terminal part of the native SREBP-1 and lacks the helix-loop-helix region, leading to a lack of any transactivity for SRE-containing promoters (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The amount of the SREBP-2 protein in the nuclear extracts fromSREBP-1 −/− mice was approximately 2-fold increased compared with that of wild-type mice in both fasted and refed states.

In accordance with the nuclear protein data, SREBP-1 mRNA level in the fasted wild-type animals was very low and markedly induced by refeeding. The aberrant SREBP-1 transcript from the disrupted gene was also elevated in the refed liver. In contrast, there was no significant change in mRNA levels of SREBP-2 in the fasted and refed wild-type mice and in fasted SREBP−/− mice. RefedSREBP-1 −/− mice showed only a slight increase in SREBP-2 mRNA level as compared with other groups. The mRNA of SCAP did not change markedly except that refedSREBP-1 −/− mice had a slightly decreased level, the biological significance of which is currently unknown. The mRNA levels for both hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and reductase, rate-limiting enzymes in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, were significantly increased only in refed SREBP−/− mice.FIG. 4Quantification of mRNA levels of various genes supporting lipogenesis in livers from fasted or refed wild-type (WT) and SREBP-1−/−(KO) mice as measured by Northern blot analysis.The RNA filters prepared as described in the Fig. 2 legend were hybridized with the indicated 32P-labeled cDNA probe.

Equal aliquots of 15 μg were pooled and subjected to electrophoresis and blot hybridization with the indicated32P-labeled cDNA probe. The shorter band observed inSREBP-1 −/− mice with SREBP-1 probe is the aberrant transcript derived from the disrupted SREBP-1 gene (25Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L.

The acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 are lipogenic enzymes that play a central role in the production of major long chain monounsaturated fatty acids in mammals by conversion of acetyl-CoA to palmitoleate (C16:1) and oleate (C18:1). The mRNA levels of these enzymes were suppressed in livers of fasted wild-type mice and required longer exposure for signal detection (data not shown; see Table II for reference). They were markedly elevated in the normal livers by refeeding (Fig. 3). The mRNA levels for acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in the fasted SREBP-1 −/− mice were low and essentially similar to those of fasted normal mice. However, theSREBP-1 −/− mice had a blunted induction of these enzymes upon refeeding compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3 and Table II). The absence of SREBP-1 caused significant decreases in SCD1 mRNA levels in both fasted and refed states. The most dramatic differences in the hepatic mRNA levels of refedSREBP-1 −/− mice were observed in other lipogenic enzymes. As depicted in Fig. 4, the genes for glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and S14 were markedly activated by refeeding in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4 and Table II).

TRX has a highly conserved amino acid sequence, Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys, at its active site.

Besides the mechanism, involvement of redox regulation in the p53 gene has been reported. The site-specific DNA binding activity of p53 is dependent upon its highly conserved central DNA binding domain that contains a zinc ion (20Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C.

Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Mutation of these cysteine residues in murine p53 markedly decreased sequence-specific DNA binding activityin vitro (24Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and metal chelators modulate the DNA binding capacity of p53 (25Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, redox factor 1 (Ref-1) was purified as an activator of p53 and was shown to transactivate p53 in vivo (26Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Ref-1 was originally identified as a DNA repair enzyme exhibiting apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity (27Seki S. Akiyama K. Watanabe S. Hatsushika M. Ikeda S. Tsutsui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20797-20802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Ref-1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein and purified as an activator of activator protein-1 (AP-1) that is a heterodimer of Fos/Jun. Ref-1 activates AP-1 DNA binding activity by reducing cysteine residues in Fos and Jun (29Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar,30Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). TRX activates the AP-1 Fos/Jun (heterodimer) through the nuclear redox protein Ref-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously reported that TRX is able to interact physically with Ref-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that TRX may, directly or indirectly, regulate p53 activity. Thus, in this study, we tried to elucidate the role of TRX, an endogenous reducing agent, in p53 activity.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that TRX enhances the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 both directly (when applied alone) or indirectly (by enhancing Ref-1 mediation), and we have provided clear evidence that TRX is an important factor in the regulation of p53 DNA binding activity.In the EMSA, recombinant TRX or Ref-1 augmented the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53. The effect of TRX and Ref-1 was seen at almost the same concentration. The enhancing effect of TRX on Ref-1-dependent p53 activation was marked in the EMSA. The effect of Ref-1 was reached to a plateau level at a concentration of 0.1 μm. However, the effect was further augmented by the addition of TRX.In the luciferase assay, our results showed that either TRX or Ref-1 augments p53-dependent p21 expression in vivo. As seen in the EMSA, TRX enhanced Ref-1-mediated p53 activation in WiDr cells harboring mutant p53 or MG63 cells lacking p53. These results further indicate a functional coupling between TRX and Ref-1 in the p53 activation system. The interaction between TRX and Ref-1 has also been observed in other systems. TRX can activate AP-1 DNA binding activity (29Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), acting as a factor in a redox cascade involving Ref-1. We have previously demonstrated that TRX and Ref-1 enhanced PMA-induced activation of AP-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of transcriptional factor polyoma virus enhancer-binding protein 2 is regulated by the redox mechanism with TRX and Ref-1 (9Akamatsu Y. Ohno T. Hirota K. Kagoshima H. Yodoi J. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14497-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The interaction of co-activators with hypoxia-inducing factor 1-α or hypoxia-inducing factor 1-α-like factor has been regulated by TRX/Ref-1 system (12Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 7: 1905-1914Crossref Google Scholar). The overexpression of the mTRX C32S/C35S, which lacks reducing activity, decreased the effect of the transfected Ref-1, as well as TRX, indicating that at least part of the Ref-1 mediation of p53 activation is modulated by the redox activity of TRX. In the presence of a reducing agent, Ref-1 was reported to be a potent stimulator of wild-type p53 (26Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our previous report also showed the direct interaction of Ref-1 and TRX through the cysteine residues of TRX (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides its direct action on p53, TRX seems to be able to act indirectly on p53 via the redox regulation of Ref-1. Mutant TRX (C32S/C35S) overexpression suppressed the transactivation of the p21 promoter by CDDP treatment in MCF-7 cells, indicating that the redox regulation of TRX plays a role in physiological p53 activity. In a yeast system, the importance of the TRX system in p53 activity has also been reported, in studies in which deletion of the thioredoxin reductase gene inhibited p53-dependent reporter gene expression (36Pearson G.D. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5431-5434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown here that TRX translocates from cytosol to nucleus upon treatment with CDDP. The translocation was also induced by oxidative stresses, including UV irradiation (37Masutani H. Hirota K. Sasada T. Ueda T.Y. Taniguchi Y. Sono H. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or hydrogen peroxide (10Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is presumed that TRX translocates to the nuclear compartment upon oxidative stress to interact with Ref-1. It might be possible that TRX is involved in the mechanism of translocation of p53 upon oxidative stress. Both the direct interaction between p53 and TRX and the mechanism of the dynamic regulation of Ref-1 by TRX in the nuclear compartment require further analysis.Higher levels of TRX are detected in cancerous tissues, such as adult T cell leukemia, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cervical neoplastic squamous epithelial cells of the uterus (38Makino S. Masutani H. Maekawa N. Konishi I. Fujii S. Yamamoto R. Yodoi J. Immunology. 1992; 76: 578-583PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fujii S. Nanbu Y. Nonogaki H. Konishi I. Mori T. Masutani H. Yodoi J.

Cancer. 1992; 69: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Several groups analyzed p53 status in adult T cell leukemia patients and human T cell leukemia virus I-infected cells. Inhibition of p53 transactivation function by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax protein was reported (41Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutations of p53 are frequent in cancer tissues. Therefore, this abnormal expression of TRX might be explained as a compensation mechanism for p53 dysfunction. Mutation of the cysteine residues in p53 could function as an escape mechanism from redox regulation. This possibility should be further investigated in the cancerous predisposition or cancerous tissues.In this study, p53-dependent p21 expression was up-regulated by the TRX-Ref-1 cascade. p53 is thought to be a gatekeeper against DNA damage, and it induces G1 arrest to afford cells time to repair damaged DNA (15Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6696) Google Scholar, 16Lotem J. Peled-Kamar M. Groner Y. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TRX is induced and translocated into cell upon oxidative stress. Thus, our results suggest that TRX interacts with p53 in response to oxidative stress and plays a role in stimulating p53 function.

Besides the mechanism, involvement of redox regulation in the p53 gene has been reported. The site-specific DNA binding activity of p53 is dependent upon its highly conserved central DNA binding domain that contains a zinc ion (20Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C.

Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Mutation of these cysteine residues in murine p53 markedly decreased sequence-specific DNA binding activityin vitro (24Rainwater R. Parks D. Anderson M.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mann K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3892-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and metal chelators modulate the DNA binding capacity of p53 (25Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, redox factor 1 (Ref-1) was purified as an activator of p53 and was shown to transactivate p53 in vivo (26Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Ref-1 was originally identified as a DNA repair enzyme exhibiting apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity (27Seki S. Akiyama K. Watanabe S. Hatsushika M. Ikeda S. Tsutsui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20797-20802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Demple B. Herman T. Chen D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11450-11454Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Ref-1 is a ubiquitous nuclear protein and purified as an activator of activator protein-1 (AP-1) that is a heterodimer of Fos/Jun. Ref-1 activates AP-1 DNA binding activity by reducing cysteine residues in Fos and Jun (29Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar,30Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). TRX activates the AP-1 Fos/Jun (heterodimer) through the nuclear redox protein Ref-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously reported that TRX is able to interact physically with Ref-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that TRX may, directly or indirectly, regulate p53 activity. Thus, in this study, we tried to elucidate the role of TRX, an endogenous reducing agent, in p53 activity. DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that TRX enhances the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 both directly (when applied alone) or indirectly (by enhancing Ref-1 mediation), and we have provided clear evidence that TRX is an important factor in the regulation of p53 DNA binding activity.In the EMSA, recombinant TRX or Ref-1 augmented the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53. The effect of TRX and Ref-1 was seen at almost the same concentration. The enhancing effect of TRX on Ref-1-dependent p53 activation was marked in the EMSA. The effect of Ref-1 was reached to a plateau level at a concentration of 0.1 μm. However, the effect was further augmented by the addition of TRX.In the luciferase assay, our results showed that either TRX or Ref-1 augments p53-dependent p21 expression in vivo. As seen in the EMSA, TRX enhanced Ref-1-mediated p53 activation in WiDr cells harboring mutant p53 or MG63 cells lacking p53. These results further indicate a functional coupling between TRX and Ref-1 in the p53 activation system. The interaction between TRX and Ref-1 has also been observed in other systems. TRX can activate AP-1 DNA binding activity (29Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), acting as a factor in a redox cascade involving Ref-1. We have previously demonstrated that TRX and Ref-1 enhanced PMA-induced activation of AP-1 (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of transcriptional factor polyoma virus enhancer-binding protein 2 is regulated by the redox mechanism with TRX and Ref-1 (9Akamatsu Y. Ohno T. Hirota K. Kagoshima H. Yodoi J. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14497-14500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The interaction of co-activators with hypoxia-inducing factor 1-α or hypoxia-inducing factor 1-α-like factor has been regulated by TRX/Ref-1 system (12Ema M. Hirota K. Mimura J. Abe H. Yodoi J. Sogawa K. Poellinger L. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1999; 7: 1905-1914Crossref Google Scholar). The overexpression of the mTRX C32S/C35S, which lacks reducing activity, decreased the effect of the transfected Ref-1, as well as TRX, indicating that at least part of the Ref-1 mediation of p53 activation is modulated by the redox activity of TRX. In the presence of a reducing agent, Ref-1 was reported to be a potent stimulator of wild-type p53 (26Jayaraman L. Murthy K.G. Zhu C. Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Our previous report also showed the direct interaction of Ref-1 and TRX through the cysteine residues of TRX (31Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Therefore, besides its direct action on p53, TRX seems to be able to act indirectly on p53 via the redox regulation of Ref-1. Mutant TRX (C32S/C35S) overexpression suppressed the transactivation of the p21 promoter by CDDP treatment in MCF-7 cells, indicating that the redox regulation of TRX plays a role in physiological p53 activity. In a yeast system, the importance of the TRX system in p53 activity has also been reported, in studies in which deletion of the thioredoxin reductase gene inhibited p53-dependent reporter gene expression (36Pearson G.D. Merrill G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5431-5434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown here that TRX translocates from cytosol to nucleus upon treatment with CDDP. The translocation was also induced by oxidative stresses, including UV irradiation (37Masutani H. Hirota K. Sasada T. Ueda T.Y. Taniguchi Y. Sono H. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), or hydrogen peroxide (10Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is presumed that TRX translocates to the nuclear compartment upon oxidative stress to interact with Ref-1. It might be possible that TRX is involved in the mechanism of translocation of p53 upon oxidative stress. Both the direct interaction between p53 and TRX and the mechanism of the dynamic regulation of Ref-1 by TRX in the nuclear compartment require further analysis.Higher levels of TRX are detected in cancerous tissues, such as adult T cell leukemia, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cervical neoplastic squamous epithelial cells of the uterus (38Makino S. Masutani H. Maekawa N. Konishi I. Fujii S. Yamamoto R. Yodoi J. Immunology. 1992; 76: 578-583PubMed Google Scholar, 39Fujii S. Nanbu Y. Nonogaki H. Konishi I. Mori T. Masutani H. Yodoi J.

Cancer. 1992; 69: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Several groups analyzed p53 status in adult T cell leukemia patients and human T cell leukemia virus I-infected cells. Inhibition of p53 transactivation function by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax protein was reported (41Pise-Masison C.A. Choi K.S. Radonovich M. Dittmer J. Kim S.J. Brady J.N. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutations of p53 are frequent in cancer tissues. Therefore, this abnormal expression of TRX might be explained as a compensation mechanism for p53 dysfunction. Mutation of the cysteine residues in p53 could function as an escape mechanism from redox regulation. This possibility should be further investigated in the cancerous predisposition or cancerous tissues.In this study, p53-dependent p21 expression was up-regulated by the TRX-Ref-1 cascade. p53 is thought to be a gatekeeper against DNA damage, and it induces G1 arrest to afford cells time to repair damaged DNA (15Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6696) Google Scholar, 16Lotem J. Peled-Kamar M. Groner Y. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). TRX is induced and translocated into cell upon oxidative stress. Thus, our results suggest that TRX interacts with p53 in response to oxidative stress and plays a role in stimulating p53 function.

https://openalex.org/W2107261609,"Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are negative regulators of hepatic lipogenesis that exert their effects primarily at the level of transcription. Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors responsible for the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid, and triglyceride synthesis. In particular, SREBP-1 is known to play a crucial role in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression in the liver. To explore the possible involvement of SREBP-1 in the suppression of hepatic lipogenesis by PUFA, we challenged wild-type mice and transgenic mice overexpressing a mature form of SREBP-1 in the liver with dietary PUFA. In the liver of wild-type mice, dietary PUFA drastically decreased the mature, cleaved form of SREBP-1 protein in the nucleus, whereas the precursor, uncleaved form in the membranes was not suppressed. The decreases in mature SREBP-1 paralleled those in mRNAs for lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In the transgenic mice, dietary PUFA did not reduce the amount of transgenic SREBP-1 protein, excluding the possibility that PUFA accelerated the degradation of mature SREBP-1. The resulting sustained expression of mature SREBP-1 almost completely canceled the suppression of lipogenic gene expression by PUFA in the SREBP-1 transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that the suppressive effect of PUFA on lipogenic enzyme genes in the liver is caused by a decrease in the mature form of SREBP-1 protein, which is presumably due to the reduced cleavage of SREBP-1 precursor protein.

A high carbohydrate diet induces the synthesis of several lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),1 fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase (PK) (1Goodridge A.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10173-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10925-10930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This coordinate induction of enzymes is due to increased mRNA levels, resulting primarily from the accelerated transcription. Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been well established as negative regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Allmann and Gibson (4Allmann D.W. Gibson D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 51-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that adding 2% linoleate to a high carbohydrate fat-free diet suppressed the rate of hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis and the activities of FAS and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase by nearly 70% in mice. In contrast, supplementing the high carbohydrate diet with palmitate, oleate, or cholesterol had no effect on hepatic lipogenesis or the activity of lipogenic enzymes. Since then, several investigators have demonstrated that dietary PUFA of the n-6 and n-3 families suppress hepatic lipogenesis. This anti-lipogenic action of PUFA reflects decreases in mRNA levels of hepatic enzymes including ACC, FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and PK. The regulation by PUFA has been shown to be primarily at the transcriptional level; however, the precise mechanism for this action remains unknown (5Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Thelen A. Liimatta M. Ren B.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are transcription factors that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family and regulate enzymes responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper family, SREBPs are synthesized as precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. Upon activation, SREBPs are released from the membrane into the nucleus as a mature protein by a sequential two-step cleavage process. To date, three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, -1c and -2, have been identified and characterized. The predominant SREBP-1 isoform in the liver is SREBP-1c. Whereas SREBP-2 is relatively selective in transcriptionally activating cholesterol biosynthetic genes, SREBP-1c has a greater role in regulating fatty acid synthesis than cholesterol synthesis in the liver (9Shimano H.

The role of SREBP-1 for the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis has been recently established. Changes in hepatic mature SREBP-1c protein levels were shown to parallel those of mRNAs for lipogenic genes in the liver using a dietary manipulation and a transgenic technology (12Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Moreover, SREBP-1 has been demonstrated to be crucial for the carbohydrate stimulation of lipogenic genes in mice with a targeted disruption of SREBP-1 (30Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol.

These findings led us to hypothesize that the suppressive effect of PUFA on lipogenic gene transcription in liver is mediated through a decrease in mature SREBP-1 levels. To verify this hypothesis, the current studies were designed using wild-type mice and transgenic mice overexpressing mature SREBP-1c in the liver (TgSREBP-1c). First, we show that the amount of mature SREBP-1 in the liver is decreased by dietary PUFA. Next, we demonstrate that the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of TgSREBP-1c mice is maintained at a relatively high level and that this expression follows the pattern of SREBP-1 levels that remain elevated even in the presence of dietary PUFA. These results indicate that the suppression of hepatic gene expression of lipogenic enzymes by PUFA is most likely due to the decrease in the mature SREBP-1 protein.

Standard laboratory chow, high carbohydrate fat-free diet (70% sucrose and 20% casein supplemented with methionine, vitamins and minerals), and high protein fat-free diet (90% casein and no carbohydrate with methionine, vitamins, and minerals) were obtained from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). 7-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (21–23 g) were purchased from CLEA (Tokyo, Japan) and adapted to the environment for 1 week prior to study. SREBP-1c transgenic mice overexpressing amino acids 1–436 of human SREBP-1c under control of the rat PEPCK promoter (TgSREBP-1c) were made as described previously (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). A line homozygous for the transgene was established. All mice were housed in a controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and diet. Prior to sacrifice, each group of three animals was fed a diet containing the indicated fatty acids, prepared fresh daily, for 7 days. The diet for wild-type mice consisted of a high carbohydrate fat-free chow supplemented with 20% (w/w) tristearin, 20% triolein, 20% fish oil (sardine or tuna), 5% linoleic acid, or 5% EPA ethyl ester. The diet for TgSREBP-1c mice was a high protein diet mixed with 20% triolein, 20% triolein plus 5% EPA ethyl ester, or 20% fish oil (sardine). For the comparison of high protein and high carbohydrate diets, wild-type mice were examined on diets composed of high protein or high carbohydrate chow mixed with 20% triolein or 20% fish oil (sardine). All mice were sacrificed during the early phase of the light cycle in a nonfasted state. Nuclear extracts and membrane fractions from mice livers were prepared as described previously (13Sheng Z.

Aliquots of nuclear (20 μg) and membrane (30 μg) proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the ECL Western Blotting Detection System kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 film. The primary antibodies (polyclonal) were as described previously (14Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin.

Total hepatic RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Life Technologies), and 10-μg RNA samples (equally pooled from three mice) were run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The cDNA probes used were cloned as described previously (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. To examine the effect of PUFA on SREBP-1 in mice livers, wild-type mice were fed a high carbohydrate diet supplemented with PUFA (linoleate, EPA, or two kinds of fish oil rich in EPA or docosahexaenoic acid) for 7 days. Immunoblot analysis of liver nuclear extracts from these mice showed that feeding wild-type mice a diet with EPA for 7 days resulted in a ∼3-fold decrease in the amount of hepatic mature SREBP-1 protein, compared with feeding with the control diet (high carbohydrate without fat). This suppressive effect of EPA on the mature SREBP-1 was consistently observed in six independent experiments including Figs. 1, a b, andc, 2, and 7. Fish oil (sardine, rich in EPA, or tuna, rich in docosahexaenoic acid) decreased mature SREBP-1 protein more profoundly, as shown in Figs. 1, b and c, 2, and7. Dietary linoleate also suppressed mature SREBP-1 to a lesser extent (Fig. 2). In contrast, neither saturated (tristearin) nor monounsaturated (triolein) fatty acids reduced mature SREBP-1 (Fig. 2). The amount of mature SREBP-2 protein did not change significantly with any of the dietary manipulations (Figs. 1,a and b, 2, 6 a, and 7).FIG. 2Immunoblot analysis of SREBP-1 and -2 in nuclear extracts from livers of mice fed a high carbohydrate diet containing various fatty acids.

SCD1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The generation of mature SREBP-1 protein requires several steps including transcription, translation, and a proteolytic cleavage from microsomal membranes. To clarify the mechanism by which PUFA down-regulates mature SREBP-1 protein, the amounts of SREBP-1 (both precursor and mature forms in the membrane and nuclear extracts, respectively; Fig. 1 c) as well as SREBP-1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3) were compared between control and PUFA (EPA or fish oil)-fed mice. In contrast to the mature protein, which was profoundly decreased by PUFA feeding, no significant reduction was observed in either mRNA or membrane-bound precursor protein levels. This indicates that PUFA regulates the abundance of mature SREBP-1 protein mainly at a posttranslational level, presumably through cleavage and/or degradative processes. We compared mRNA levels of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes in the liver of mice fed diets with or without PUFA (linoleate, EPA, or fish oil) for 7 days as measured by Northern blot analysis. Consistent with previous reports, dietary PUFA suppressed hepatic expression of lipogenic genes such as ACC, FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, PK, and Spot 14 (Fig. 3). This down-regulation of lipogenic genes was confined to PUFA (linoleate, EPA, fish oil)-fed groups of mice and was not observed in mice fed saturated (i.e. tristearin) or monounsaturated (i.e.triolein) fatty acids. This specificity to PUFA corresponded to the pattern of suppression observed with mature SREBP-1 protein (Fig. 2). These findings are in support of the hypothesis that PUFA decreases mRNA levels of lipogenic genes through the suppression of mature SREBP-1. To examine whether the PUFA suppression of lipogenic genes was ascribed to the decrease in mature SREBP-1, a transgenic mouse model that forcibly expresses a mature form of SREBP-1 protein in the liver (TgSREBP-1c) was used. In these transgenic mice, the expression of a nuclear form of SREBP-1c that is active without cleavage is under control of the rat PEPCK promoter and is induced when animals are fed a high protein, low carbohydrate diet (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 a, the mature SREBP-1 in the liver of TgSREBP-1c mice fed a high protein diet is dominated by the transgene product, the amount of which was comparable with that of intrinsic SREBP-1 mature form in wild-type mice on a high carbohydrate diet (Fig. 4 a, lanes 1 and2). The hepatic mRNA levels of lipogenic genes in these TgSREBP-1c mice were also similar to those in wild-type mice on a high carbohydrate diet (Fig. 5;lanes 1 and 2).FIG. 5Northern blot analysis of lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes from livers of wild-type or TgSREBP-1c mice on PUFA diets. Wild-type mice were fed a high carbohydrate fat-free diet (lane 1), and homozygous TgSREBP-1c mice were fed a high protein diet with 20% triolein (lane 2), 5% EPA ethyl ester plus 20% triolein (lane 3) or 20% sardine fish oil (lane 4) for 7 days and sacrificed in a nonfasted state. Total RNA (10 μg) pooled equally from livers of each group was subjected to Northern blotting, followed by hybridization with the indicated cDNA probes. A cDNA probe for 36B4 (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0) was used to confirm equal loading.

It was found that the amount of the transgene product was not affected by dietary PUFA (EPA or fish oil) (Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, dietary PUFA did not change the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes such as ACC, FAS, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, ATP citrate lyase, malic enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, Spot 14, or PK in the liver of TgSREBP-1c mice (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that the suppressive effect of PUFA on lipogenic genes is primarily mediated through the decrease in the amount of mature SREBP-1. To confirm that dietary PUFA suppresses mature SREBP-1 and lipogenic genes in mice fed protein-based diets in the same way as in mice placed on carbohydrate-based diets, wild-type mice were fed a high protein diet supplemented with triolein or fish oil for 7 days, and the amount of mature SREBP-1 (Fig. 6 a) and the mRNA levels of lipogenic genes (Fig. 6 b) in the liver were evaluated by immunoblot and Northern blotting analyses, respectively. As expected, dietary PUFA exerted the same suppressive effect on the background of high protein diets as was observed on high carbohydrate diets. It was also revealed that a high carbohydrate diet elevated mature SREBP-1 as well as mRNAs for lipogenic genes more strongly than a high protein diet. These results provide further evidence for the dependence of lipogenic gene transcription on mature SREBP-1. It is well known that PUFA are ligands for PPARα (16Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar), and some biological effects of PUFA such as induction of peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation are mediated by PPARα (18Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine whether PPARα is involved in the suppression of mature SREBP-1 by PUFA, the amount of mature SREBP-1 in wild-type mice fed a diet containing fenofibrate, a ligand for PPARα, for 7 days was examined. Immunoblot analysis of liver nuclear extracts showed that neither fenofibrate nor troglitazone, a ligand for PPARγ, affected the amount of mature SREBP-1 in the liver (Fig. 7). These data suggest that the suppressive effect of PUFA on mature SREBP-1 is not mediated by PPARα or -γ. The expected effects of PPARα were confirmed by the observation of increased mRNAs of acyl-CoA oxidase and cytochrome P-450 4A2 (data not shown). In the present study, we clearly showed that the suppression of lipogenic gene expression by PUFA in the liver was primarily due to decreases in the mature form of SREBP-1. We first demonstrated that the abundance of mature SREBP-1 in the liver was decreased by dietary PUFA. A similar observation has been reported in a study in cultured cells (19Worgall T.S. Sturley S.L. Seo T. Osborne T.F. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25537-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, it was reported that mature SREBP-1 was also decreased by oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, which exhibited no significant effect on hepatic SREBP-1 in our in vivo study. Extensivein vivo studies using mouse or rat liver have demonstrated that an antilipogenic effect is confined to PUFA and that this response appears to be specific to liver (20Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1993; 32: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our results describing the effects of different fatty acids on SREBP-1 nuclear protein in the liver are consistent with these previous reports. The cause for the discrepancy in the effect of oleate between liver and cultured cells is currently unknown. As shown in Fig. 1c, we demonstrate that PUFA regulates the abundance of mature SREBP-1 protein primarily at the posttranslational level. Moreover, we show that PUFA did not decrease the amount of mature SREBP-1 directly expressed from the transgene, indicating that PUFA does not accelerate the degradation of SREBP-1 mature protein. These data suggest that the regulation of SREBP-1 by PUFA occurs at the step of cleavage of the precursor protein from membranes. If the suppression of lipogenic gene expression by PUFA is caused by the decrease in mature SREBP-1 protein, sustained SREBP-1 expression should abolish the effect of PUFA. To verify this hypothesis, homozygous TgSREBP-1c mice fed a high protein diet were used. As described previously, the rat PEPCK promoter used for the transgene is activated by feeding a high protein, low carbohydrate diet (21Short M.K. Clouthier D.E. Schaefer I.M. Hammer R.E. Magnuson M.A. Beale E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1007-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consequently, the hepatic expression of mature SREBP-1 in these mice was approximately equal to that of carbohydrate-stimulated wild-type mice and was not affected by PUFA. In the presence of sustained SREBP-1 mature protein levels, the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver of TgSREBP-1c mice was maintained as high as that of wild-type mice on a high carbohydrate diet irrespective of PUFA ingestion. This indicates that the mature form of SREBP-1 is a determining factor in the suppressive effect of dietary PUFA on lipogenic gene expression. It should be noted that the mRNA of PK was expressed more strongly in wild-type mice fed a high carbohydrate diet than in TgSREBP-1c mice fed a high protein diet, although similar amounts of mature SREBP-1 were present. This observation suggests the possibility that the transcriptional regulation of the PK gene is more strongly controlled by transcription factor(s) other than SREBP-1. This notion could explain the weaker effect of PUFA on the mRNA level of PK. It is also consistent with the previous observation that SREBP-1 disruption had a smaller influence on mRNA expression of PK in comparison with those of other lipogenic enzymes whose induction by a high carbohydrate diet was completely abolished in the SREBP-1 knockout mice. The cis-acting elements in the promoter region for carbohydrate stimulation and PUFA suppression of lipogenic genes have been analyzed by many investigators. In the case of enzymes such as FAS (22Fukuda H. Iritani N. Noguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), ATP citrate lyase (23Fukuda H. Iritani N. Katsurada A. Noguchi T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and PK (24Liimatta M. Towle H.C. Clarke S. Jump D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1147-1153PubMed Google Scholar), glucose/insulin response elements overlap with PUFA response regions. Especially, the glucose/insulin and PUFA response element in the FAS promoter has been shown to contain an SREBP-binding site (25Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The PUFA response region in the mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 promoter is also reported to have an SREBP-binding site (26Waters K.M. Miller C.W. Ntambi J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1349: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These data are supportive of our finding that carbohydrate stimulation and PUFA suppression are mediated by a common molecule, SREBP-1. In contrast, promoter analyses of the Spot 14 gene previously revealed that the PUFA-regulatory region was located separately from the region for dietary carbohydrate and insulin responses (5Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Thelen A. Liimatta M. Ren B. Badin M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since PUFAs are known as activators of PPARα (16Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar), the effects of PUFA through PPARα were also examined. The finding that fenofibrate did not affect the amount of mature SREBP-1 in the liver indicates that the suppressive effect of PUFA on mature SREBP-1 is not mediated by PPARα. This finding is compatible with the previous study using PPARα-null mice, which showed that PPARα was not required for the PUFA-mediated inhibition of either FAS or Spot 14 gene expression (18Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It has now been established that SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 function to regulate fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis, respectively, with some overlap in function (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 10Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since SREBP-2 is a regulator of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, it is itself highly controlled by cellular sterol levels. This regulation, including the actions of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and the site 1 and 2 proteases, has been extensively studied (8Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar, 28Sakai J. Rawson R.B. Espenshade P.J. Cheng D. Seegmiller A.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Mol.

Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, the more fine tuned regulation of SREBP-1 has yet to be determined. The data presented here indicate for the first time that the cleavage of SREBP-1 in the liver could be regulated by a mechanism other than sterol concentrations and presumably in a fashion related to fatty acid metabolism. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism by which PUFA modulates the cleavage of SREBP-1 precursor protein in terms of the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis. In summary, we have demonstrated that dietary PUFA decreased the amount of hepatic SREBP-1 mature protein by a reduction in the cleavage of SREBP-1 precursor protein, causing the suppression of lipogenic gene expression in the liver."

In cells expressing the dopamine transporter, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters results in a significant reduction in dopamine uptake. This phorbol ester-mediated inhibition of dopamine transport is associated with a decrease in V max, although the apparent affinity of the transporter for dopamine remains unchanged. Using a green fluorescent protein-tagged dopamine transporter stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, we show in live cells that the decrease in transporter activity is caused by the rapid internalization of carriers from the plasma membrane. This redistribution of the transporter is specific to phorbol ester activation and is unaffected by the presence of either substrates or inhibitors of the carrier. Upon the addition of phorbol esters, transporters at the cell surface are rapidly endocytosed through a clathrin-mediated and dynamin-dependent mechanism into early endosomes, where they colocalize with transferrin. The internalized carrier is targeted to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway and is completely degraded within 2 h of protein kinase C activation.

The inhibition of DAT activity is the result of a decrease inV max, with little or no change in the apparent affinity of the transporter for substrate, implying a decrease in the number of functional transporters at the surface of the cell. Activation of PKC also results in a decrease in the number of surface binding sites for nontransported inhibitors of the DAT (7Zhang L. Coffey L.L. Reith M.E.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Kitayama S. Dohi T. Uhl G.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Zhu S.J.

Furthermore, the inhibition of uptake activity observed inXenopus oocytes expressing the human DAT (hDAT) is accompanied by a decrease in membrane capacitance, suggesting that the inhibition of uptake activity may be due to increased endocytosis of the transporter (9Zhu S.J. Kavanaugh M.P. Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1358-1365PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PKC has also been suggested to result in changes in the subcellular localization of hDAT (12Pristupa Z.B. McConkey F. Liu F. Man H.Y. Lee F.J.S. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Synapse. 1998; 30: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, high intracellular levels of DAT associated with transient overexpression systems made it difficult to evaluate the difference in transporter distribution by indirect immunofluorescence. Although internalization of the DAT as a mechanism of PMA-mediated inhibition remains a compelling possibility, this phenomenon has yet to be examined effectively. Likewise, changes in the trafficking of the transporter molecules in response to PKC activation and the cellular pathways involved have not been determined.The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins has provided the opportunity for real time optical analysis of protein trafficking in individual cells. To understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the PMA-mediated inhibition of DAT activity, we have generated a line of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that stably express a GFP-tagged hDAT. This cell line has allowed us to directly visualize the subcellular localization of the DAT and observe the trafficking of the transporter molecules over time. We show that the activity of GFP-DAT is rapidly inhibited in the presence of phorbol esters and that this inhibition is the result of a significant loss of transporter protein from the plasma membrane. Internalization of hDAT into early endosomes is due to increased endocytosis through association with clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). Once internalized, the transporters transit through the endosomal/lysosomal pathway and are ultimately degraded.DISCUSSIONSeveral members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporter family, including the dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, taurine, and GABA transporters, have been shown to be acutely regulated upon activation of PKC by phorbol esters (8Kitayama S.

A number of studies have implicated internalization of the transporters as a possible means of modulating transporter activity (7Zhang L. Coffey L.L. Reith M.E.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Zhu S.J. Kavanaugh M.P. Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Cell surface biotinylation of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters provided the first direct evidence that the surface expression of these carriers was reduced after treatment with PMA (31Apparsundaram S. Schroeter S. Giovanetti E. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 744-751PubMed Google Scholar,32Qian Y. Galli A. Ramamoorthy S. Risso S. DeFelice L.J. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 45-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters are redistributed after PKC activation when examined by indirect immunofluorescence (12Pristupa Z.B. McConkey F. Liu F. Man H.Y. Lee F.J.S. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Synapse. 1998; 30: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 31Apparsundaram S. Schroeter S. Giovanetti E. Blakely R.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 744-751PubMed Google Scholar). However, the results of these studies were obscured by high intracellular levels of transporter, making interpretation of the data difficult. The work presented here provides clear evidence that regulation of DAT activity through PKC activation is the result of rapid internalization of the carrier. Furthermore, we show that PMA-mediated internalization of the DAT is due to an increase in endocytosis through CCPs and that, following internalization, the transporter is targeted to the lysosomal pathway, where it is ultimately degraded.Under normal conditions, the majority of DAT protein is found at the cell surface (Fig. 3). Only the fully glycosylated carrier is found at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by the complete absence of the unglycosylated species on blots of surface-labeled proteins (Fig. 4 A). In response to stimulation by PMA, a PKC-mediated phosphorylation event leads to the rapid internalization of the transporter (Fig. 3). Whether PMA-mediated internalization is the result of the direct phosphorylation of the hDAT remains unclear. The primary amino acid sequence of the hDAT contains multiple consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation, and increased phosphorylation of the hDAT has been shown in response to PMA stimulation (10Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J.

Lett. 1996; 216: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the canonical PKC phosphorylation sites within the GABA and glycine transporters, which are also regulated by PKC activation, has no effect on PMA-mediated inhibition of transporter activity (30Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Adams R. Betz H. Schloss P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, internalization of these transporters as well as of the hDAT may be the result of phosphorylation of an unidentified protein that is associated with the carriers at the cell surface.In the MDCK cell system, essentially all of the transporter found at the cell surface is internalized in response to PKC activation. In the presence of cycloheximide, when all of the detectable transporter molecules are localized to the plasma membrane, there is a nearly complete loss of both uptake activity (Fig. 4 C) and surface fluorescence (Fig. 4 B) in response to application of PMA. There is less inhibition of uptake activity when protein synthesis is allowed to continue (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that under normal conditions the plasma membrane is repopulated by intracellular stores of DAT. These findings are consistent with the idea that internalization of the DAT requires the phosphorylation of a protein that is associated with the DAT at the cell surface. However, the possibility remains that translocation is the result of direct phosphorylation of the DAT if PKC preferentially phosphorylates the mature transporter molecules found at the cell surface. The observation that PMA-mediated translocation of the DAT is independent of the presence of substrate or inhibitor (Fig. 3 B) suggests that conformational changes resulting from the binding of dopamine or cocaine are not important to either phosphorylation or translocation.The DAT is internalized through a clathrin-mediated mechanism after activation of PKC. We were able to completely block PMA-mediated translocation of DAT with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin 1 (Fig. 5 A). Receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, a clathrin-dependent process, was also completely abolished under these conditions. Dynamin has also been suggested to play a role in the budding of caveolae (35Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 36Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). However, internalization of the DAT due to an increase in endocytosis through this pathway is unlikely, as PMA inhibits the formation of caveolae in kidney epithelial cells (37Smart E.J. Foster D.C. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, digitonin, filipin, and nystatin, inhibitors of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, had no effect on DAT translocation, even at concentrations in excess of those demonstrated to effectively block the formation of caveolae (38Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In contrast, internalization of the DAT was almost completely abolished by either chlorpromazine or monodansylcadaverine, potent inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (data not shown).Our observation that the DAT is degraded after PMA-mediated internalization implies that this process is irreversible. Others have suggested that translocation of the hDAT in response to PMA is bidirectional (12Pristupa Z.B. McConkey F. Liu F. Man H.Y. Lee F.J.S. Wang Y.T. Niznik H.B. Synapse. 1998; 30: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), but this was examined only in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, which may vary significantly from mammalian cells in protein trafficking. Furthermore, as protein synthesis was not inhibited, the possibility that the reappearance of the transporter at the cell surface simply reflects repopulation by intracellular stores cannot be eliminated. We did not observe any recovery of uptake activity or alteration in subcellular localization in MDCK-GFP-DAT cells under the same conditions (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that the DAT returns to the cell surface in response to the appropriate stimulation; however, the nature of this signal remains unknown.PMA is known to modulate the surface expression of a number of biologically important proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (39Beguinot L. Hanover J.A. Ito S. Richert N.D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the Na+/glucose cotransporter (40Wright E.M. Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D. Zampighi G.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 287-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chemokine receptors (41Amara A. Gall S.L. Schwartz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12611-12618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the surface glycoprotein CD4 (43Hoxie J.A. Matthews D.M. Callahan K.J. Cassel D.L. Cooper R.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 1194-1201PubMed Google Scholar). A normal constituent of lymphoid cells, CD4 is rapidly internalized in response to activation of PKC by either PMA or by stimulation of the T cell receptor (44Acres R.B. Conlon P.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Gallis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16210-16214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a manner similar to the DAT, CD4 internalization is mediated by an increase in clathrin-associated endocytosis and is followed by lysosomal degradation of the protein (45Pelchen-Matthews A. Parsons I.J. Marsh M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1209-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 46Petersen C.M. Christensen E.I. Andresen B.S. Moller B.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 160-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The signals that direct phosphorylated CD4 to CCPs and to the lysosome are found within the cytoplasmic tail of the molecule. The two most common signals for targeting of membrane proteins to coated pits are tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs (reviewed in Ref. 47Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal tail of the hDAT contains two tyrosine residues. One of these tyrosine residues, Tyr-578, is positioned too close to a membrane-spanning domain to serve as a signal for accumulation in coated pits (48Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S.Q. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the second tyrosine (Tyr-593) to internalization of the transporter has yet to be determined, it is not flanked by any of the amino acid residues normally associated with canonical endocytosis signals (47Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Although the carboxyl tail of the hDAT does not contain an obvious dileucine motif, there is a dileucine sequence (Leu-440, Leu-441) within the putative intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 8 and 9. Whether or not this dileucine sequence is involved in PMA-mediated internalization of the DAT has not been established.The idea that internalization of the DAT is a consequence of its association with another protein after PKC activation remains an intriguing one. The regulation of CD4 trafficking during viral infection provides an interesting illustration of such a mechanism. Like PKC activation, infection of T cells by human immunodeficiency virus induces the internalization and degradation of CD4 (49Guy B. Kieny M.P. Riviere Y. Le Peuch C. Dott K. Girard M. Montagnier L. Lecocq J.P. Nature. 1987; 330: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This is attributed to the presence of the virally encoded protein Nef (50Garcia J.V. Miller A.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 508-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), which associates directly with CD4 (51Aiken C. Konner J. Landau N.R. Lenburg M.E. Trono D. Cell. 1994; 76: 853-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and directs both the accumulation of CD4 first in CCPs (52Bresnahan P.A. Yonemoto W. Ferrell S. Williams-Herman D. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1235-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then in lysosomes (53Piguet V. Gu F. Foti M. Demaurex N. Gruenberg J. Carpentier J. Trono D. Cell. 1999; 97: 63-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor also involves internalization through its interaction with a secondary protein. In the presence of agonist, phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptor binds to the connector protein β-arrestin, which promotes the accumulation of β2-adrenergic receptor in CCPs through a direct interaction with clathrin cages (54Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar).Redistribution of membrane proteins is proposed to play an important role in synaptic plasticity. Stimulation of long term depression has recently been demonstrated to induce the internalization of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor in hippocampal cultures (55Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The kinase-dependent regulation of other molecules important to synaptic function has also been shown to be due to increased endocytosis. The intracellular accumulation of both muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and GABA type A receptors is seen after activation of PKC by phorbol esters (56Liles W.C. Hunter D.D. Meier K.E. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5307-5313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Chapell R. Bueno O.F. Alvarez-Hernandez X. Robinson L.C. Leidenheimer N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32595-32601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the fate of the AMPA and GABA type A receptors after internalization remains unknown, the muscarinic receptor is subsequently degraded. Such changes in trafficking of receptors, ion channels, and transporters could serve as an important mechanism for regulating neurotransmitter signaling and synaptic strength. The dopamine transporter (DAT)1 mediates the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic neurons. This process of reaccumulation effectively reduces extracellular dopamine concentrations and limits activation of both presynaptic and postsynaptic dopamine receptors. The DAT is the primary target of psychostimulant drugs, which block the reuptake of released dopamine, resulting in an increase in synaptic dopamine levels (reviewed in Ref. 1Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Drug Alcohol Depend. 1998; 51: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Functional loss of dopamine transport either through pharmacological inhibition (2Ritz M.C. Lamb R.J. Goldberg S.R. Kuhar M.J. Science. 1987; 237: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar) or genetic knockout (3Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) results in profound physical, physiological, and behavioral changes. Given the essential role played by the DAT in the modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission, the regulation of transporter activity is of considerable interest. Cloning of the DAT and elucidation of its amino acid sequence revealed the presence of several consensus sites for protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation (3Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar, 4Kilty J. Lorang D. Amara S.G. Science. 1991; 254: 578-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 5Shimada S.

Inhibition of DAT activity in response to activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) has been observed in striatal synaptosomes and in several systems using cloned transporters expressed in either mammalian cells or Xenopusoocytes (6Copeland B.J.

Analysis of the amino acid sequence of tuberin, the 200-kDa product of theTSC2 gene, identified a region with limited homology to GTPase-activating proteins. Previously, we demonstrated direct binding between tuberin and hamartin. Here we investigate this interaction in more detail. We show that the complex is predominantly cytosolic and may contain additional, as yet uncharacterized components alongside tuberin and hamartin. Furthermore, because oligomerization of the hamartin carboxyl-terminal coiled coil domain was inhibited by the presence of tuberin, we propose that tuberin acts as a chaperone, preventing hamartin self-aggregation.

Renal, cardiac, and retinal tissues are also often affected. The majority of cases of TSC are sporadic, caused by ade novo mutational event. However, in familial cases the disease segregates as an autosomal dominant trait, linked either to chromosome 9q34 (TSC1) or to chromosome 16p13.3 (TSC2).

Screening large numbers of TSC patients indicates that the majority of patients carry TSC2mutations. The ratio of TSC1 to TSC2 mutations in familial cases is approximately equal (4Jones A.C.

The TSC1 gene codes for hamartin, a novel 130-kDa protein. Hamartin has a relatively high proportion of hydrophilic amino acids and a large region close to the carboxyl terminus that is predicted to form coiled coil structures (amino acids 719–998). Coiled coils mediate many protein-protein interactions (5Lupas A. van Dyke M. Stock M. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3460) Google Scholar). In addition, hamartin contains a putative transmembrane domain, and it has been suggested that hamartin is associated with membranes (6Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P.

Studies using the yeast two-hybrid system indicate that the first of the tuberin coiled coil regions (amino acids 346–371) and the first heptad repeats of the hamartin coiled coil domain are involved in the association between the two proteins (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J. Sampson J.R. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol.

The demonstration that tuberin and hamartin bind directly and the fact that mutations to either gene lead to the same phenotypic spectrum suggest that both proteins are required for the correct function of the tuberin-hamartin complex, and that it is the inactivation of the complex that leads to TSC. Here we investigate the formation, composition, and subcellular localization of the tuberin-hamartin complex and demonstrate that tuberin may act as a chaperone, preventing self aggregation of hamartin via its carboxyl-terminal coiled coil domain. The full-length TSC1 and TSC2 expression constructs have been described previously (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J.

Truncated TSC1 and TSC2 expression constructs were derived by appropriate restriction digestion of the full-length cDNAs.

Partial TSC1 cDNAs encoding amino acids 228–572, 466–788, and 788–1153 were cloned into pcDNA3.1-derived expression vectors containing either an amino-terminal Xpress epitope tag or a carboxyl-terminal myc epitope tag (Invitrogen). The rabaptin cDNA was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen with rab4 as bait and cloned into pcDNA3.1His. 2B. Nagelkerken and P. van der Sluijs, submitted for publication. Antisera specific for human tuberin and hamartin have been described (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J. Sampson J.R.

Acid α-glucosidase expression constructs and antibodies have been described previously (21Hermans M.M.P. Kroos M.A. Van Beeuman J. Oostra B.A. Reuser A.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 13507-13512Google Scholar, 22Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Transferrin-Texas Red conjugate was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Expression constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells with LipofectAMINE and PLUS reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). For immunocytochemistry, cells on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized in either 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min or methanol for 20 min. The coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.15% glycine, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies. Images were captured using the Power Gene fluorescence in situhybridization system on a Leica DM RXA microscope. Images were processed using a filter wheel (Chroma Technology) and the Adobe Photoshop software package. GAL4 activation and binding domain constructs encoding amino acids 334–1153 of hamartin (EE1a and EE1b, respectively) were as described previously (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J. Sampson J.R. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Yeast host strain Y190 was cotransformed with 2.5 μg of each plasmid according to the method of Klebe and co-workers (23Klebe R.J. Harris J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene. 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Transformants were plated on media lacking tryptophan and leucine and on media lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay. HeLa cells (three confluent 10-cm plates) were washed with PBS and collected by scraping into PBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in homogenisation buffer (3 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The cell suspension was homogenized by repeated (10 times) passage through a 25-gauge hypodermic needle and respun as above to remove the nuclei and unbroken cells. The postnuclear supernatant was then spun at 38,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer alone or homogenization buffer containing one of the following: 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.7, 1% Triton X-100, 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 1% Triton X-100 plus 0.15 m NaCl, or 0.5 m NaCl. The suspension was then respun at 38,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman SW50.1 ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C, and the pellet and supernatant fractions were recovered and analyzed by immunoblotting. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared from three confluent 10-cm plates of HeLa cells as described under “Subcellular Fractionation.” The postnuclear supernatant was brought to 50% (w/w) sucrose and overlaid with a 15–40% (w/w) sucrose gradient. After centrifugation at 42,000 rpm for 14 h in a Beckman SW50.1 ultracentrifuge rotor at 4 °C, 0.2-ml gradient fractions were analyzed for the presence of hamartin and tuberin by immunoblotting. HeLa (confluent 10-cm plate) or transfected COS (6-cm plate) cells were washed with PBS, collected by scraping, and pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in 250 μl of TEN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the cleared detergent extract was layered on top of a 5–25% (w/w) sucrose gradient in TEN buffer (3.5 ml) over a 0.5-ml 40% (w/w) sucrose cushion and spun at 42,000 rpm for 14 h in an SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the top and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against hamartin and tuberin. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared from HeLa cells lysed in TEN buffer as described above. Gel filtration was then performed on a Superose 6 column using the SMART fast protein liquid chromatography system, according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 50-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Thyroglobulin (660 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) were run as protein molecular size markers. Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS cells (T25 culture flask) were washed twice with 5 ml of PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 1 ml of serum-free medium lacking methionine and cysteine (labeling medium). This medium was then replaced with 0.5 ml of labeling medium containing 0.4 mCi/ml Tran35S label (ICN). After pulse labeling by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed extensively and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum for 0, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. The cells were then transferred to ice, washed twice with 5 ml of PBS, and lysed in TEN buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared detergent lysates were transferred to 3 μl of antiserum, incubated on ice for 60 min, and transferred to 35 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead suspension. The beads were rotated gently at 4 °C for 60 min, washed extensively with TEN buffer and high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), and resuspended in Laemmli gel-loading buffer (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated according to standard procedures on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. We first analyzed the localization of tuberin and hamartin by subcellular fractionation. HeLa cells were homogenized and fractionated by high speed centrifugation into pellet and supernatant fractions. As shown in Fig. 1, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that both tuberin and hamartin were present exclusively in the pellet fraction. Extraction of the pellet with either 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid or Triton X-100 did not alter the fractionation profile of either protein. After high-speed centrifugation, both tuberin and hamartin were recovered in the pellet fraction. In contrast, resuspension of the pellet in either high ionic strength (0.5 m NaCl) or high pH (10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.7) buffers resulted in partial solubilization of both proteins. Cofractionation of tuberin and hamartin is consistent with the two proteins binding together in a complex, whereas solubilization by 10 mmNa2CO3 but not by 1%Triton X-100 suggests that the complex is unlikely to be associated with membranes and therefore that tuberin and hamartin are more likely to be cytosolic proteins. Coimmunoprecipitation of tuberin and hamartin from the high salt- and high pH-solubilized fractions with antisera specific for either protein indicated that, under these conditions, tuberin and hamartin remained bound together in a complex (data not shown). To investigate the putative cytosolic localization of tuberin and hamartin in more detail, flotation gradient density centrifugation was performed. The postnuclear supernatant from a HeLa cell homogenate was brought to a concentration of 50% sucrose and overlaid with a 15–40% sucrose gradient of decreasing density. After high speed centrifugation at 42,000 rpm for 14 h in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor, fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by immunoblotting. Organelles and membranes disperse along the gradient according to their buoyant density, whereas cytosolic proteins remain in the bottom layer. As shown in Fig. 2, the vast majority of tuberin and hamartin remained in the lower cytosolic fractions, whereas the lysosomal enzyme α-glucosidase was present in the upper half of the gradient (data not shown). This result strongly suggested that tuberin and hamartin colocalise to the cytosol. A very small proportion (<1%) of both tuberin and hamartin consistently cofractionated with a membrane fraction. This suggests that the tuberin-hamartin complex might associate transiently with a specific membrane. Whether the tuberin-hamartin complex shuttles between membrane-bound and cytosolic states and the possible significance of this function of the complex are currently under investigation. Because our antibodies against tuberin and hamartin did not enable us to define reliably the localization of the endogenous proteins by immunocytochemistry, we expressed tuberin and hamartin exogenously, in transfected COS cells. First we transfected a TSC2 expression construct. Tuberin was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm and was not obviously associated with intracellular membranes. Because tuberin had been reported to be associated with the Golgi complex (15Wienecke R. Maize Jr., J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar), we used wheat germ agglutinin as a marker for the Golgi complex. As shown in Fig. 3, we did not detect any association between tuberin and the Golgi complex. Our results are therefore not in agreement with those of Wienecke and co-workers (15Wienecke R. Maize Jr., J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar) but are consistent with the finding that tuberin binds rabaptin, a cytosolic effector of rab5 (10Xiao G.-H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.S.

Cell. 1993; 83: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (399) Google Scholar). We performed double label immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation studies on cells cotransfected with both TSC2 and rabaptin cDNAs. As shown in Fig. 4, both proteins gave a very similar diffuse, cytoplasmic labeling pattern. However, despite this colocalization and in contrast to the findings of Xiao and co-workers (10Xiao G.-H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we could find no evidence for a direct association between tuberin and rabaptin in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Yeast two-hybrid assays for interaction between tuberin and rabaptin were also negative (data not shown).FIG. 4Localization of tuberin, hamartin, and rabaptin in COS cells.

In contrast to the diffuse labeling of tuberin, hamartin was predominantly localized to distinct, punctate cytoplasmic structures. Furthermore, unlike tuberin, which is partially recruited to the hamartin structures (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J. Sampson J.R. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), we could find no association between rabaptin and hamartin either by double label immunofluorescence, as shown in Fig. 4, or by coimmunoprecipitation (data not shown). Additional transfection experiments to express a series of truncated hamartin variants indicated that amino acids 788–1153, containing a large proportion of the predicted coiled coil domain, caused the punctate labeling. Hamartin constructs lacking this domain did not result in the same distinctive labeling pattern (data not shown). These results suggested that the predicted coiled coil domain was required either for association of hamartin with a membrane-bound organelle or alternatively for the formation of large, hamartin-containing protein aggregates. To investigate the subcellular localization of hamartin in more detail, we performed a series of double label immunofluorescence experiments with marker proteins for the central vacuolar system. One possibility was that the punctate labeling reflected association with a membrane bound organelle. However, hamartin did not co-localize with the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein disulphide isomerase, with the Golgi complex-specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin, with the early endosomal and late endosomal markers rab5 and rab7, or with lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (data not shown). Moreover, the structures did not label with fluorescently labeled transferrin, a marker for early endocytic compartments. To investigate the alternative explanation that the punctate structures were attributable to specific self-aggregation of hamartin caused by homomeric interaction of the carboxyl-terminal coiled coil domain, yeast two-hybrid assays were performed. A cDNA encoding the hamartin coiled coil region (amino acids 334–1153) was cloned into Gal4 activation (pGADGH) and binding (pGBT9) domain constructs and tested for interaction using the β-galactosidase assay. As shown in Fig. 5, a strong induction of β-galactosidase activity was detected, suggesting that the hamartin coiled coil domains had the ability to form homodimers. No β-galactosidase activity was detected with either activation or binding domain-hamartin fusion construct alone. The fact that hamartin interacted with itself in yeast two-hybrid assays suggested that the labeling pattern observed in cells transfected with TSC1 might indeed represent hamartin self-aggregation. We took a biochemical approach to investigate this question. COS cells transfected with TSC1 cDNA were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was then overlaid onto a 5–25% sucrose gradient and subjected to high speed centrifugation at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor for 14 h. As shown by the immunoblot analysis in Fig. 6 a, hamartin was confined to the pellet fraction and was not detectable in the gradient. This suggested that hamartin was present in detergent-resistant protein complexes that were unlikely to be associated with membranes, because the latter were solubilized by the 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in the lysis buffer. Identical results were obtained with detergent lysates prepared from COS cells expressing a truncated hamartin protein containing amino acids 788–1153 only (data not shown), whereas addition of 0.5m NaCl to the lysate did not affect the distribution of hamartin. Therefore, using three independent assays, we showed that the coiled coil domain of hamartin promotes self-aggregation into insoluble, detergent- and salt-resistant protein complexes. As shown in Fig. 6 b, using the same sucrose gradient centrifugation procedure on detergent lysates of COS cells transfected with TSC2, we detected >95% of tuberin approximately halfway along the gradient. Only a minor proportion (<5%) was detectable in the pellet fraction, suggesting that most if not all of the overexpressed tuberin was not associated with the dense, detergent-resistant fraction and was therefore, in contrast to hamartin, not part of an insoluble protein complex. The different sedimentation profiles of tuberin and hamartin reflected the distinct immunofluorescent labeling patterns; overexpressed tuberin produced a diffuse cytosolic labeling, in contrast to the punctate labeling of hamartin. To gain more insight into the intracellular localization of the tuberin-hamartin complex, high speed velocity gradient centrifugation was performed on detergent lysates of nontransfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6 c, tuberin and hamartin co-migrated through the gradient. Similar results were obtained with COS cells cotransfected with TSC1 and TSC2 (data not shown). Neither protein was present in the pellet fraction, suggesting that tuberin and hamartin form a soluble complex, and that tuberin may therefore prevent the formation of large, insoluble hamartin aggregates, possibly by interfering with hamartin-hamartin binding. Because tuberin binding prevented the formation of large, detergent-insoluble hamartin aggregates, we reasoned that tuberin may act as a chaperone, maintaining hamartin in a soluble form in the cytosol by preventing hamartin from binding to itself. According to this idea, the association between tuberin and hamartin would be expected to occur rapidly after hamartin is synthesized. To investigate this issue we transfected COS cells with TSC1 and TSC2 cDNAs and metabolically labeled the proteins for 10 min with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (TranS). The cells were subsequently chased in media lacking labeled amino acids for between 0 and 180 min. The cells were then lysed, tuberin and hamartin were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates, and coimmunoprecipitating proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 7, even at the earliest chase times tuberin and hamartin coimmunoprecipitated. Because protein synthesis occurs at a rate of ∼5–10 amino acids per second (17Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), it takes ∼5 min to synthesize full-length tuberin (1784 amino acids) and hamartin (1164 amino acids); therefore, the two proteins must associate during or very soon after synthesis. To determine the size of the tuberin-hamartin complex, we performed gel filtration on HeLa cell detergent lysates. Samples were loaded on a Superose 6 column, and fractions eluting from the column were analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 8, tuberin and hamartin co-eluted in fractions 14–18, between the thyroglobulin (660 kDa; fraction 12) and catalase (240 kDa; fraction 22) molecular size markers. The elution positions of the marker proteins are indicated witharrowheads. Co-elution of tuberin and hamartin helps confirm that both proteins are in a complex and provides a first indication of the size of this complex. We estimate that the molecular size of the tuberin-hamartin complex is >450 kDa. The molecular sizes of tuberin and hamartin are 200 and 130 kDa, respectively. Therefore, co-elution of the two proteins is consistent with the presence of a ∼330-kDa tuberin-hamartin dimer but not a 2:2 tuberin-hamartin tetramer, which would be expected to elute in fraction 12, together with the 660-kDa thyroglobulin marker. Because we estimate that the molecular size of the complex is >450 kDa, it seems likely that the tuberin-hamartin complex contains additional, as yet unidentified, protein components. The resolution of the Superose 6 column was not sufficient to exclude 2:1 or 1:2 tuberin-hamartin heterotrimers (∼530 and ∼460 kDa, respectively). Current evidence indicates that many of the lesions characteristic of TSC arise when a second somatic mutation abolishes completely the expression of either hamartin or tuberin (18Sampson J.R. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1477-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the two proteins bind each other, and because inactivation of either gene causes the same disease, it follows that the tuberin-hamartin complex is required for whatever function is disrupted in TSC. Furthermore, it implies that the two proteins should co-localize to the same intracellular compartment(s). Our data, from a variety of different biochemical approaches, indicate that this is indeed the case, and that the majority of the tuberin-hamartin complex is cytosolic. However, we also obtained evidence that at steady state a very small proportion is associated with membranes. Although the significance of this finding still has to be confirmed, it does not rule out a role for the tuberin-hamartin complex in vesicle docking (6Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that tuberin and hamartin form a complex, and it is difficult to reconcile the differing localizations of tuberin and hamartin reported in the literature with these findings, as well as with the co-fractionation results detailed here. We could not confirm the reported punctate distribution of hamartin in cells expressing endogenous levels of the protein (6Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in line with others (10Xiao G.-H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), we could not support the proposed localization of tuberin to the Golgi (15Wienecke R. Maize Jr., J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that the formation and localization of the tuberin-hamartin complex is different in different cell types, because Planck and co-workers (6Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar) studied human kidney 293 cells, and Wienecke and co-workers (15Wienecke R. Maize Jr., J.C. Shoarinejad F. Vass W.C. Reed J. Bonifacino J.S. Resau J.H. de Gunzburg J. Yeung R.S. DeClue J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 913-923PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the localization of tuberin in different renal tumor, adenocarcinoma, and astrocytoma cell lines, whereas most of our studies were performed in HeLa cells. The tuberin-hamartin complex is large (we estimate that the molecular size is >450 kDa), and binding between the two proteins is resistant to detergent extraction, high salt, and high pH. Resistance to detergent indicates that membrane association is not required for formation of the complex, consistent with earlier yeast two-hybrid assays (14van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J.P. Snell R.G. van den Ouweland A.M.W. Reuser A.J.J. Sampson J.R. Halley D.J.J. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), whereas solubility of the complex in a high pH sodium carbonate buffer indicates that the tuberin-hamartin complex is not an integral membrane complex. Partial solubilization in high salt is consistent with association between the tuberin-hamartin complex and additional cellular components. However, we could find no evidence that rabaptin was associated with tuberin, hamartin, or the tuberin-hamartin complex, suggesting that further searches for proteins that interact with either tuberin or hamartin are necessary to unravel the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex. Hamartin can form homomeric protein complexes. Whether this interaction is important with respect to the formation of the tuberin-hamartin complex or for the pathogenesis of TSC is not yet clear. Our results suggest that the punctate labeling pattern observed in cells overexpressing hamartin is attributable to oligomerization of the coiled coil domain and that tuberin may interfere with this process, because the gel filtration and ultracentrifugation fractionation profiles of hamartin in the presence of tuberin are different from those in the absence of tuberin. Therefore, tuberin may act as a chaperone for hamartin. Demonstration that the tuberin-hamartin complex forms during or very soon after protein synthesis provides support for this idea. We could find no evidence for hamartin-hamartin aggregation in cells expressing normal levels of hamartin (and tuberin), and the punctate labeling and fractionation profile may therefore be caused by overexpression. However, it will be interesting to study the fractionation of hamartin from cells in which tuberin expression has been lost, in Eker rat-derived tumor cell lines for example. Analogous to the disruption caused by the aggregation of insoluble proteins containing long glutamine stretches (19Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), aggregation of hamartin may also interfere with normal neuronal cell function. Considering the consequences of TSC2 or TSC1 inactivation, the data presented here suggest that the formation and localization of the complex is critically dependent on the direct interaction between tuberin and hamartin. Because loss of either protein leads to TSC, and because the activity of tuberin may be altered when associated with hamartin, the important function with respect to the pathogenesis of the disease may be that of the hamartin-containing complex. Reports on the putative functions of tuberin have generally focused on tuberin alone and have not taken hamartin into account (9Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 10Xiao G.-H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol.

This may partly explain the diverse range of proposed functions and suggests that the true function of the tuberin-hamartin complex, with particular regard to the pathogenesis of TSC, has yet to be established. In summary, we have shown that tuberin and hamartin colocalize, and that the tuberin-hamartin complex is cytosolic and may contain additional components. In addition, our results indicate that both tuberin and hamartin are required for the correct localization and function of the complex. Binding between tuberin and hamartin occurs rapidly after synthesis of the two proteins and prevents hamartin self-aggregation caused by intermolecular homomeric binding of the coiled coil domain. We are continuing with a more detailed analysis of the tuberin-hamartin complex, its localization, function, and additional component parts. We thank A. Hoogeveen, R.

Clinical observations suggested that Ritonavir may exert a direct effect on the immune system unrelated to inhibition of the human immunodeficiency virus, type I protease.

In search of a molecular target we found that Ritonavir inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome whereas the tryptic activity was enhanced. In this study we kinetically analyzed how Ritonavir modulates proteasome activity and what consequences this has on cellular functions of the proteasome.

At low concentrations of Ritonavir (5 μm) cells were more sensitive to canavanine but proliferated normally whereas at higher concentrations (50 μm) protein degradation was affected, and the cell cycle was arrested in the G1/S phase.

Inhibition of the HIV-I protease leads to the release of noninfectious virus particles and has thus been the aim of drug development in AIDS therapy (1Moyle G. Gazzard B. Drugs. 1996; 51: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several cleavages performed by the HIV-I protease lie between the amino acids phenylalanine (or tyrosine) and proline. Endoproteolytic cleavages N-terminal of proline residues have not been frequently observed in mammalian proteases, which was the premise for the design of transition state mimetics of the Phe-Pro bond as potential inhibitors of the HIV-I protease (2Erickson J.

A number of HIV-I protease inhibitors have been successfully used in clinical therapy of HIV-I infection (9Deeks S.G. Smith M. Holodniy M. Kahn J.O. JAMA. 1997; 277: 145-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy consisting of HIV-I protease inhibitors and nucleoside analogues showed a marked decrease in viremia with a simultaneous increase in CD4+ helper T cells after the initiation of treatment. Remarkably, even in patients that (because of resistance of the virus) remained viremic upon highly active antiretroviral therapy, the number of CD4+ helper T cells in peripheral blood increased suggesting that there was a direct effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on the immune system unrelated to the inhibition of viral replication (10Perrin L. Telenti A. Science. 1998; 280: 1871-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This clinical finding was the incentive to test whether a widely applied HIV-I protease inhibitor named Ritonavir (11Kempf D.J. Marsh K.C. Denissen J.F. McDonald E. Vasavanonda S. Flentge C.A. Green B.E. Fino L. Park C.H. Kong X. Wideburg N.E. Saldivar A. Ruiz L. Kati W.M. Sham H.L. Robins T. Stewart K.D. Hsu A. Plattner J.J. Leonard J.M. Norbeck D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Surprisingly, the treatment of mice with therapeutical concentrations of Ritonavir markedly reduced the cytotoxic immune response against two T cell epitopes of LCMV and prevented the expansion of LCMV-reactive cytotoxic T cells (12André P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. deGiuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This effect was not because of an inhibition of LCMV replication but resulted from a decrease in the presentation of LCMV epitopes on major histocompatibility complex class I molecules of infected cells. In search of a potential molecular target for Ritonavir we tested its effect on peptide hydrolysis by the 20 S proteasome as it is the key enzyme for the generation of antigenic peptides as ligands for major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (3Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 13Groettrup M. Soza A. Kuckelkorn U. Kloetzel P.M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 429-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Ritonavir inhibited the chymotryptic activity of mouse and human 20 S proteasomes at a similar potency asN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (LLnL) whereas the tryptic activity was enhanced (12André P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. deGiuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Such a modulation of proteasome activity has not been observed with other proteasome inhibitors (14Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and we decided to further investigate the mechanism of proteasome modulation by Ritonavir that most likely accounts for the observed cellular defects in antigen processing. Ritonavir partially protected the proteasome subunits MB-1 (X) and/or LMP7 from covalent active site modification with a vinyl sulfone inhibitor and could be nicely accommodated in the active site pockets of the homologous yeast subunit. This suggests that these proteasome subunits are the predominant targets for competitive inhibition by Ritonavir in accordance with our kinetic analysis. A selective block of the cell cycle in G1/S and a partial inhibition of protein degradation was found at concentrations that were ten-fold higher than those required for immunomodulation. Modulators of proteasome activity may therefore be useful for controlling antigen processing and the cytotoxic immune response. The human lymphoblastoid cell line T2 (15Salter R.D. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and the murine embryonal fibroblast line B8 (4Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M.

Ehmann C. Osaki A. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13344-13348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorogenic peptide substrates were diluted from 10 mm frozen stock solutions inN,N-dimethylformamide except for the 10 mm (Z)-LLE-βNA stock solution that was prepared freshly each time in Me2SO. Assays were performed for 90 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer E (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 500 ng of purified 20 S proteasome, and fluorescence was determined with a Tecan SpectraFluor Plus plate reader at 30, 60, and 90 min after initiation of the reaction using emission and excitation wavelengths of 360 and 465 nm, respectively, for MCA and 340 and 405 nm, respectively, for βNA. Shown values are from 60-min incubations and were in the linear range of the reaction; triplicates were measured for all data points. For the ultrafiltration assays 100 μm Ritonavir was added to 2.5 μg/ml 20 S proteasomes in buffer E, and the Ritonavir was removed by three rounds of 1-h incubations at 37 °C followed by ultrafiltration at 300 × g through Centricon 100 filters. The proteasomes were brought to the original volume with buffer E, and an aliquot was used for activity determination with 100 μm Suc-LLVY-MCA substrate. Ritonavir (Abbott) was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 50 mm. LLnL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 5 mm. Both substances were diluted directly into complete IMDM. The final concentration of Me2SO was adjusted to 1%, and the final concentration of methanol was adjusted to 0.1%. 100 μl of T2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/ml for time points of incubation up to 48 h and at a density of 2 × 105/ml for incubation times from 48 to 96 h. 100 μl of medium containing the diluted inhibitors Ritonavir and LLnL was added. After the indicated time points the viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. All values are means of triplicates. The experiment was repeated two times, and identical results were obtained. T2 cells were grown for 2 days in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Ritonavir. 100 μl of T2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 mg/l l-arginine (prepared with the Select-Amine kit from Life Technologies, Inc.) instead of 200 mg/l l-arginine in conventional RPMI 1640 medium. 100 μl of the same medium containing canavanine at the indicated concentrations and Ritonavir was added. The plates were incubated for 24 h, and the viability was determined as described above. All values are means of triplicates. The experiment was repeated two times, and identical results were obtained. T2 cells were cultured to a density of about 2 × 105/ml. To arrest cells with a 2 n DNA content, hydroxyurea was added at a final concentration of 0.76 mg/ml. Cells arrested with a 4n DNA content were prepared with nocodazole at 3.2 μg/ml final concentration. Ritonavir was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations as described above. After 48 h of incubation cells were harvested by centrifugation and fixed with ethanol. An aliquot of cells treated with 50 μm Ritonavir was washed three times with medium (10 min. incubation between the centrifugation steps) and incubated for another 48 h before fixation. After fixation cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. 50 μl of 38 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, containing 50 mg/l propidium iodide, 50 μl of 10 mg/ml RNase A, and 50 μl of 400 μg/ml propidium iodide in water was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Analysis was done on a Becton Dickinson FACSCAN® flow cytometer with Lysis II software. To determine the degradation rates of the murine cytomegalovirus protein pp89 aliquots of 1 × 106 B8 cells were treated for 2 days with 0, 10, or 50 μm Ritonavir or for 30 min with 50 μm LLnL. The cells were incubated for 30 min in Met-/Cys-deficient RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of inhibitors. After starvation the cells were incubated for 1 h in methionine-/cysteine-free medium plus 0.2 mCi/ml TranS35(ICN Biomedicals) in the presence of either Ritonavir or LLnL. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline the cells were incubated for the indicated time points in IMDM plus inhibitors. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after detachment with calcium-/magnesium-free medium. 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 35 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.3 μm aprotinin). 5 × 106 cpm aliquots of postnuclear lysates, which were taken for immunoprecipitation, were diluted in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.3 μm aprotinin, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin). After 2 h of preclearing with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), pp89 was immunoprecipitated over night with the monoclonal antibody 6–58.1 (17Keil G.M. Fibl M.R. Koszinowski U. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 422-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the beads were washed three times with buffer A. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and quantitated with a BAS 2000 imager (Fuji). To determine the impact of Ritonavir on the catabolism of Arg-β-galactosidase we used the ubiquitin protein reference technique as described by Lévy et al. (18Lévy F. Johnsson N. Rümenapf T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing cDNAs for DHFR (hemagglutinin-tag)-ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase and DHFR (hemagglutinin-tag)-ubiquitin-Met-β-galactosidase were kindly provided by Dr. F. Lévy, Lausanne, Switzerland. B8 cells were treated for 2 days with the indicated concentrations of Ritonavir. The DHFR-ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase or DHFR-ubiquitin-Met-β-galactosidase expression constructs were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described elsewhere (19Schmidtke G. Eggers M. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After 16 h of incubation the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitate was removed, and the cells were incubated for 6 h in IMDM. Cells were starved for methionine and cysteine, and pulse labeling was performed in Met-/Cys-deficient medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml TranS35 label for the indicated time points. After the labeling the dishes containing cells were transferred to ice. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer directly in the culture dish on ice for 30 min. Preclearing and immunoprecipitation were performed as described above, except that the antibodies Gal-13 (anti β-galactosidase, Sigma) and F-7 (anti HA-tag, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Proteasomes were isolated from the mouse lymphoblastoid cell line EL-4 and were incubated with 1.8 × 104 Bq/ml 125I-NLVS and various concentrations of Ritonavir for 2 h at 37 °C as previously described (20Bogyo M. Shin S. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was quenched by addition of 4 × SDS sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. We have performed FlexX (21Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar) calculations to predict the potential binding mode of Ritonavir to the chymotryptic site of the yeast 20 S proteasome. FlexX requires the definition of the active site of the protein. We therefore took the x-ray structure (22Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Satock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar) complexed with LLnL, removed the inhibitor, and defined the active site within a sphere of radius of 25.0 Å around Thr 1 of subunit β5 (PRE2). The three-dimensional structure of Ritonavir (23Ohata Y. Shinkai I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was build with Sybyl 6.3 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) modeling software. Correct atom types, stereocenters, hybridization states, and bond types were defined with respect to the Sybyl mol2 file format. Formal charges were assigned to each atom, and an energy minimization was performed using the Tripos force field. Because FlexX samples the conformational space of the ligand on the basis of the Mimuba approach (24Klebe G. Mietzner T. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1994; 8: 583-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) bond lengths and bond angles are kept unchanged during the docking calculation. Therefore the reasonable minimized geometry should be useful. The selection of the anchor fragment (25Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 369-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was done automatically by using the “AUTODOCK” command. No refinement calculations were performed after the FlexX run. Previously we have shown that the treatment of cells with 100 μm Ritonavir led to an accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitin protein conjugates, which were about 30% less abundant compared with amounts obtained after treatment with 100 μm lactacystin or LLnL (12André P.

The induced degradation of IκBα, a well characterized proteasome substrate, was inhibited at 100 μm Ritonavir suggesting that Ritonavir inhibited cellular protein degradation by the proteasome at least to a certain degree (12André P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. deGiuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To further investigate this issue we studied the effect of Ritonavir on the degradation of a viral antigen, a typical N-terminal rule substrate, and misfolded proteins. The immediate early protein of the mouse cytomegalovirus pp89 is processed for major histocompatibility complex class I restricted antigen presentation in a proteasome-dependent manner. 2G. S., unpublished observation. We therefore followed the pp89 protein in a pulse-chase experiment to test whether its degradation was affected by Ritonavir (Fig. 1). Ritonavir inhibited pp89 degradation to an extent comparable to LLnL at a concentration of 50 μm but it had no effect at a concentration of 10 μm. In contrast to the proteinolysis of IκBα and pp89, the degradation of the N-end rule substrate Arg-β galactosidase was not changed in its metabolic stability by 10 or 50 μmRitonavir (Fig. 2). Rather than performing pulse-chase experiments we have applied the ubiquitin protein reference technique (18Lévy F. Johnsson N. Rümenapf T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to monitor Arg-β galactosidase accumulation after cleavage from a DHFR-ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase precursor protein. It is an advantage of this method that the accumulation of Arg-β galactosidase during continuous labeling can be compared with the accumulation of the metabolically stable DHFR ubiquitin protein, which is produced in equimolar amounts. The fact that LLnL but not Ritonavir led to an increase in Arg-β galactosidase accumulation suggests that the extent of inhibition of proteasomal protein degradation by Ritonavir varies between different protein substrates.FIG. 2Ritonavir does not inhibit the degradation of Arg-β-galactosidase. B8 cells expressing the fusion protein DHFR-ubiquitin-Arg-β-galactosidase were treated with 0, 10, or 50 μm Ritonavir for 2 days or with LLnL for 1 h. The cells were pulse-labeled for 10, 30, and 60 min. The two parts of the fusion protein, Arg-β-galactosidase (panel A) and DHFR-ubiquitin (panel B), which are generated by an endogenous ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, were immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Theasterisks indicate the position of the respective proteins, and the arrowheads show the position of marker proteins.

Rito, Ritonavir.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the proteasome is responsible for the removal of misfolded proteins we finally determined the effect of Ritonavir on the viability of cells that were treated with the arginine analogue canavanine (26Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 27Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar). Consistent with an inhibition of the proteasome the loss in the viability of T2 lymphoblastoid cells due to canavanine treatment was markedly enhanced by the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). As a loss in viability was already apparent at a Ritonavir concentration of 5 μm this suggests that the proteasome was already partially inhibited at this low concentration, which we previously showed to affect antigen presentation (12André P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. deGiuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of Ritonavir on cell viability under normal conditions we incubated T2 cells with titrated amounts of Ritonavir and LLnL. Whereas the proteasome inhibitor LLnL killed T2 cells in culture within 24 h at a concentration of 10 μm we saw no effect on T2 viability or proliferation at Ritonavir concentrations up to 25 μm. At a concentration of 50 μmRitonavir led to a stop in proliferation, but cells remained viable according to trypan blue exclusion for several days and resumed proliferation after removal of Ritonavir. As the proteasome inhibitor LLnL leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary, in the S phase, or in mitosis (28Sherwood S.W. Kung A.L. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) we examined how Ritonavir would affect cell cycle progression. Interestingly, the treatment of unsynchronized T2 cells (Fig. 3) or B8 cells (not shown) with 50 μm Ritonavir for 48 h led to a selective and reversible arrest of the cell cycle in G1 with a DNA content of 2 n as determined by flow cytometric analysis. For control of DNA content cells were either left untreated or were arrested in the S phase by hydroxyurea (2n) or in mitosis by nocodazole (4 n). At a concentration of 10 μm Ritonavir we did not observe any effect on cell cycle progression. A specific cell cycle arrest would be consistent with a selective block in the degradation of certain proteins (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, cyclins, etc.) specifically required for G1/S progression. As a first approach to study the mechanism how Ritonavir modulates proteasome activity we studied the hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptide substrates by 20 S proteasomes isolated from B8 mouse fibroblasts. The fluorogenic substrates Suc-LLVY-MCA, Bz-VGR-MCA, and (Z)-LLE-βNA, which are frequently used to respectively monitor the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity of the proteasome were measured. The substrate (Z)-GGL-MCA may also be cleaved by the chymotrypsin-like activity, but as this substrate behaved quite differently from Suc-LLVY-MCA in earlier studies about the effects of interferon-γ-inducible proteasome subunits (4Groettrup M. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Seeger M. Standera S. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23808-23815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) we also included it in our study. First proteasome activity was measured at titrated concentration of both Ritonavir and LLnL (Fig. 4). In contrast to LLnL, which similarly inhibits the hydrolysis of the four tested substrates in a concentration-dependent manner, Ritonavir shows a comparable inhibition only for the Suc-LLVY-MCA substrate with an IC50 value of 3 μm. The hydrolysis of (Z)-GGL-MCA and (Z)-LLE-βNA was increased at Ritonavir concentrations of 3 μm and 30 μm, respectively, and was slightly reduced at higher concentrations. The trypsin-like activity, in contrast, was consistently enhanced in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 250 μm of Ritonavir. This modulation of proteasome activities by Ritonavir was highly reproducible with three independent preparations of 20 S proteasomes from B8 mouse fibroblasts and was identical for human 20 S proteasomes isolated from T2 lymphoblastoid cells (not shown). The inhibition of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity was reversible as full activity was recovered upon removal of Ritonavir by ultrafiltration. Moreover, the peptide analogon Ritonavir remained unaltered during incubation with 20 S proteasomes as determined by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis (data not shown). Next we measured proteasome activity at three fixed concentrations of Ritonavir and increasing concentrations of the four fluorogenic substrates (Fig. 5). For the Suc-LLVY-MCA substrate we observed a proportional increase of MCA production with increasing concentrations of substrate at 1 μm but not at 10 μm Ritonavir suggesting that at low Ritonavir concentration this substrate can outcompete the modulator. Thus Ritonavir may act as a competitive inhibitor for the chymotrypsin-like activity. Interestingly, the enhancement of the trypsin-like activity by Ritonavir was not apparent anymore at high concentrations of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA suggesting that this substrate also competes with Ritonavir for binding to a site that enhances the tryptic activity and that cannot be identical to an active site responsible for the trypsin-like activity. We aimed at identifying the proteasome subunit(s) that are able to bind Ritonavir. As Ritonavir does not covalently bind to the proteasome a direct labeling of proteasome subunits with radiolabeled Ritonavir and electrophoretic analysis seems to be impossible. Our kinetic analysis suggests that Ritonavir competes with the Suc-LLVY-MCA substrate for binding to the active site of the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome. Hence we tested whether Ritonavir would be able to protect proteasome subunits from covalent modification by the active site vinyl sulfone inhibitor125I-NLVS. This radioactively labeled proteasome inhibitor was previously shown to covalently bind to the active site-bearing subunits of mouse or human proteasomes, which allows electrophoretic identification of the respective subunits (20Bogyo M. Shin S. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 29Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Ritonavir partially protected the subunits LMP7 or MB-1 (X) at a concentration of 100 μm whereas no protection of LMP2, Z, MECL-1, or Y was observed (Fig. 6). No protection was detected at lower concentrations of Ritonavir, which is most likely due to the fact that Ritonavir is a reversible competitive inhibitor that will eventually be replaced by a covalent inhibitor like125I-NLVS. This result strongly suggests that the proteasome subunits LMP7 and/or MB-1 (X) are the predominant subunits for competitive active site inhibition by Ritonavir. A three-dimensional structure of mammalian 20 S proteasomes at high resolution, which could have been used to test whether Ritonavir would fit in the P1/P3 binding pockets of the proteasome subunits LMP7 or MB-1 (X) has not yet been obtained. However, as the high resolution structure of the S. cerevisiae 20 S proteasome is known (22Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Satock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar), and as Ritonavir also inhibited the chymotryptic activity of the yeast 20 S proteasome (data not shown) we performed FlexX calculations to predict whether Ritonavir can bind in the active center of the yeast PRE2 subunit that is homologous to LMP7 and MB-1 (X). Indeed, the calculation performed as outlined under “Materials and Methods” predicted that Ritonavir should inhibit the chymotryptic activity. The thirty best inhibitor positions are very well clustered in the active center of PRE2 with predicted binding energies ranging from −34.44 to −33.40 kJ/mol. Fig. 7 shows the highest ranking result of the docked Ritonavir (colored white) superimposed with the cyan colored inhibitor LLnL. Ritonavir fills the gap between the strands similar to LLnL with the hydrophobic side chain at P1 projecting into the S1 pocket like the norleucinal side chain. The same holds true for the side chains in P2 and P3. The urea unit of Ritonavir is in contact with the adjacent PRS3 subunit and is hydrogen-bonded to Asp 114. Taken together, the docking results are in accordance with the experimental evidence that Ritonavir is a competitive inhibitor of the chymotryptic activity of the 20 S proteasome. The aim of this study was to investigate how Ritonavir acts as a modulator of proteasome activity and to determine the effects of this modulation on cellular functions of the proteasome. At therapeutically relevant concentrations (5 μm) at which immune modulation was observed Ritonavir did not affect proliferation or cell cycle progression but led to an increase in the sensitivity to canavanine. At higher concentrations of Ritonavir (50 μm) a selective inhibition of intracellular protein degradation and a reversible arrest of the cell cycle in the G1/S phase were observed. A kinetic analysis suggested that Ritonavir is a reversible and competitive inhibitor of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity and a positive effector of the trypsin-like activity. Ritonavir partially protected the proteasome subunit MB-1 (X) and/or LMP7 from covalent modification by the proteasome inhibitor 125I-NLVS and could be nicely accommodated in the active site pockets of the homologous yeast subunit, which is consistent with the kinetic analysis. Because Ritonavir inhibited the hydrolysis of the Suc-LLVY-MCA substrate most potently this result suggests that the subunits MB-1 (X) or LMP7 are the predominant subunits that account for the chymotrypsin-like activity defined by this substrate. This notion is supported by mutagenesis experiments in S. cerevisiae where the inactivation of the PRE2 subunit, which is homologous to the mammalian subunits MB-1 (X) and LMP7, led to a selective elimination of the chymotrypsin-like activity (30Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The site-directed inactivation of MB-1 or LMP7 in mammalian cells has not yet been reported. However, a study employing a panel of different vinyl sulfone inhibitors also showed that the potency in the inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of mouse proteasomes correlated with their ability to protect the subunits MB-1 (X) and LMP7 from covalent modification by radioactive inhibitors of the same class (20Bogyo M. Shin S. McMaster J.S. Ploegh H.L. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 307-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although a number of proteasome inhibitors that are, at least to some extent, selective for the chymotrypsin-like activity have been described (14Groettrup M. Schmidtke G. Drug Discov. Today. 1999; 4: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a modifier of proteasome activity that inhibits one activity (chymotrypsin-like) and simultaneously enhances a second activity (trypsin-like) has not yet been described. This enhancement, which is most prominent at an intermediate concentration of the Bz-VGR-MCA substrate (Fig. 5) cannot be attributed to binding to the trypsin-like active site that, according to a recent analysis by Salzmann et al., (31Salzmann U. Kral S. Braun B. Standera S. Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. Sijts A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is located at the N terminus of the MC14 subunit. From the present data we cannot discriminate whether the Ritonavir-binding site responsible for enhancing the tryptic activity is another active site of the 20 S proteasome that allosterically activates the tryptic activity or an undiscovered modifier site at another location of the proteasome, and we are currently addressing this question experimentally. How does a modulation of proteasome activity in vitro affect proteasome functions in the intact cell? The accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates and the inhibition of the LPS-induced degradation of IκBα (12André P. Groettrup M. Klenerman P. deGiuli R. Booth B.L. Cerundolo V. Bonneville M. Jotereau F. Zinkernagel R.M. Lotteau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13120-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) are typical consequences of proteasome inhibition suggesting that housekeeping functions of the proteasome are inhibited in cells treated with 100 μm Ritonavir. This result indicates that the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome that is inhibited to 90% at this concentration is indispensable for proliferation of cells and the intracellular degradation of IκBα, MCMV pp89, misfolded proteins, and bulk ubiquitin conjugates. Moreover, it is apparent that an increase in the trypsin-like activity cannot compensate for this inhibition. The finding that a treatment of cells with 50 μm Ritonavir did not inhibit the degradation of the well defined proteasome substrate Arg-β-gal was somewhat surprising. Apparently, at this concentration Ritonavir is unable to halt the degradation of some very short lived proteins. Whether this means that the degradation of some proteins is less amenable to selective proteasome inhibition then others is currently being tested among a panel of other protein substrates of the proteasome in our laboratory. The proteasome is responsible for the programmed destruction of many key regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle control. The peptide aldehyde inhibitor LLnL, which has been shown to bind to all active sites of the eukaryotic proteasome and which similarly affects the chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activities of the proteasome (Fig. 1), arrests the cell cycle of unsynchronized Chinese hamster ovary cells both in mitosis and the early S phase (28Sherwood S.W. Kung A.L. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. Schimke R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ritonavir led to a selective cell cycle arrest of unsynchronized cells at G1/S. Interestingly, lactacystin, which also inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome much more potently than the trypsin-like or peptidylglutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activities (32Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) and which in yeast proteasomes bound selectively to the PRE2 subunit (i.e. the MB-1 (X) homologue), also led to a cell cycle arrest in G1/S (33Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Reichard G.A. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This could suggest that in a situation where the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome becomes limiting, cell cycle regulators that need to be degraded for passing the G1/S checkpoint accumulate faster than regulators of G2/M or mitotic checkpoints. Clearly, a phase-selective arrest of the cell cycle as a consequence of proteasome modulation through Ritonavir is consistent with a substrate selectivity in affecting protein degradation. Although our results collectively support that Ritonavir is a modulator of proteasome activity in vivo, it is difficult to experimentally establish that the observed effects on antigen processing and cell metabolism can exclusively be attributed to the modulation of proteasome activity. We do not know of proteases other than the HIV-I protease and the proteasome that would be inhibited to a significant extent at a concentration of 5–10 μmRitonavir. Leucine aminopeptidase, which is inducible by interferon-γ and which has been implied in antigen processing (34Beninga J. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18734-18742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), is, at least, not inhibited by Ritonavir.2 However, as unidentified proteases may be involved in antigen processing we cannot rule out that their inhibition could contribute to the observed clinical and experimental phenotypes. Proof of the principle that the selective inhibition of one but not other proteasome subunits can influence antigen processing without affecting cell viability or proliferation has recently been obtained by the functional inactivation of the subunits Δ and LMP2 in mutant cell lines (19Schmidtke G. Eggers M. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Koszinowski U. Kloetzel P.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1641-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Selective inhibitors or modulators of proteasome activity such as Ritonavir may thus be applied to modulate the cytotoxic immune response for immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplantation or for the treatment of autoimmune diseases."

Brain lipids serve primarily in modifying the fluidity, structure, and functions of the membranes, and both anabolic and catabolic pathways of lipid metabolism are important in brain development (18Jumpsen J.

Then, using a selective activator for PPARβ, we demonstrate that the ACS2 gene is regulated by PPARβ at the transcriptional level. Reaggregated brain cell primary cultures were prepared from mechanically dissociated telencephalon of 16-day rat embryos as described previously (24Honegger P. Monnet-Tschudi F. Fedoroff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 25-49Crossref Google Scholar). Cultures were initiated and grown in serum-free, chemically defined medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (25 mm) and supplemented with insulin (0.8 μm), triiodothyronine (30 nm), hydrocortisone-21-phosphate (20 nm), transferrin (1 μg/ml), biotin (4 μm), vitamin B12 (1 μm), linoleate (10 μm), lipoic acid (1 μm), l-carnitine (10 μm), and trace elements (listed in Ref. 24Honegger P. Monnet-Tschudi F. Fedoroff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 25-49Crossref Google Scholar). Gentamicin sulfate (25 μg/ml) was used as antibiotic. Culture media were replenished by exchange of 5 ml of medium (of a total of 8 ml/flask) every third day until day 14, and every other day thereafter because of increased metabolic activity in the cells. The cultures were maintained under constant gyratory agitation (80 rpm) at 37 °C and in an atmosphere of 10% CO2/90% humidified air. PPARβ mRNA was probed with the 1.32-kb BamHI fragment of the plasmid pSG5-rPPARβ containing the coding region of the rPPARβ. 2P. Escher, S. Basu-Modak, O. Braissant, B. Desvergne, and W. Wahli, unpublished data. The different ACS mRNAs were probed with DNA fragments isolated from their respective rat cDNA containing plasmids (22Fujino T. Kang M.-J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). ACS1 mRNA was probed with the 0.96-kb EcoRV fragment of the pRACS15 plasmid. ACS2 mRNA was probed with the 2-kb EcoRI fragment of the pBACS9 plasmid. ACS3 mRNA was probed with the 2.2-kbBglII/SacI fragment of the pACS3 plasmid. L27 mRNA, which was used as an internal control, was probed with the 0.22-kb XbaI/EcoRI fragment of the pKS+/L27 plasmid (25Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above-mentioned gel-purified DNA fragments of PPARβ (100 ng), the three ACSs (100 ng each), and L27 (25 ng) were used as templates to synthesize [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes using the High Prime kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Probes were purified on Elutip-d columns according to the manufacturer's protocol (Schleicher and Schuell). Brain cell aggregates from each flask were carefully transferred to round-bottomed 14-ml Falcon tubes, washed with PBS, and frozen rapidly by plunging the capped tubes into liquid nitrogen after aspirating the residual amounts of PBS in the samples. Frozen aggregates were stored at −80 °C until use. Aggregates were thawed rapidly at 37 °C in 5 ml of TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and total cellular RNA was prepared according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. RNA (25 μg/well) was electrophoresed in a 2.2 mformaldehyde-1% agarose gel in MOPS buffer and transferred onto Zeta Probe GT-membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary blotting in 10× SSC for about 18 h. The Northern blot membranes were baked for 30 min at 80 °C, prehybridized at 65 °C for 2–6 h in 0.25 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2) containing 7% SDS, and hybridized at the same temperature with α-32P-labeled probes (2–3 × 106 cpm/ml) for 18 h. After hybridization, the membranes were sequentially washed at 65 °C for 30 min each in 20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2) containing 5% SDS and in 20 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 1% SDS and then exposed to preflashed films at −70 °C for 2–3 days for PPARβ and ACSs and 18–24 h for L27. Autoradiographs were quantified in a Elscript 400 AT/SM densitometer (Hirschmann), and the mRNA signals were normalized for the loading error using the L27 mRNA signal as internal control, as described previously (26Tyrrell R.M. Basu-Modak S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). [α-32P]UTP-labeled riboprobes were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNase protection assay was carried out on 15 μg of total RNA as described previously (25Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PPARα riboprobe was synthesized from the 717-bp TaqI fragment of the pKS+/PPARα plasmid and the L27 riboprobe from the pBS-L27(150) plasmid linearized with EcoRI. Samples were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels and quantified using a Storm 840 phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). Short DNA fragments of the three ACS cDNAs (22Fujino T. Kang M.-J. Suzuki H. Iijima H. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16748-16752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pBluescript II KS− vector (pBSII KS−) from Stratagene to use as probes for in situ hybridization. For ACS1, the 305 bp HindIII fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1484–1789 in the plasmid pRACS15 was subcloned into theHindIII site of the vector, and the recombinant plasmid was named pBSII KS−-ACS1. For ACS2, the 368-bpBamHI/EcoRI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 143–511 in the plasmid pBACS9 was subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI site in the bluescript vector, and the recombinant plasmid was named pBSII KS−-ACS2. For ACS3, the 364-bp SpeI-XbaI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 682–1047 in the plasmid pACS3 was subcloned into the vector digested with SpeI-XbaI, and the recombinant plasmid was named pBSII KS−-ACS3. The ACS1, ACS2, and ACS3 recombinant plasmids contained the insert in such an orientation that the antisense probe was synthesized with T3 RNA polymerase and the sense probe with T7 RNA polymerase. Digoxigenin-labeled PPARα and PPARβ riboprobes were transcribed in vitro from linearized, gel-purified plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (17Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Antisense probes were synthesized from the plasmids pKS+/PPARα and pSK+/PPARβ, whereas the sense probes were synthesized from the plasmids pSK+/PPARα and pKS+/PPARβ. Digoxigenin-labeled ACS riboprobes were in vitro transcribed from the plasmids pBSII KS−-ACS1, pBSII KS−-ACS2, and pBSII KS−-ACS3 linearized withXbaI for antisense probes of ACS1 and ACS2 andNotI for ACS3. Sense probes were synthesized from the same plasmids linearized with XhoI for ACS1 andHindIII for ACS2 and ACS3. Aggregates washed with PBS were embedded in tissue freezing medium (Jung, Nussloch), frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen as described previously (24Honegger P. Monnet-Tschudi F. Fedoroff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 25-49Crossref Google Scholar), and stored at −80 °C until use. Cryostat sections (12 μm thickness) were hybridized for 40 h at 58 °C with digoxigenin-labeled probes (400 ng/ml) in 5× SSC containing 50% formamide and 40 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Sections were washed, and the mRNAs were visualized by alkaline phosphatase staining as described previously (17Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar) and then dehydrated, mounted, and photographed on an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss). Monoclonal antibodies against cell type-specific proteins were used for immunohistochemical analysis of the aggregates. Antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and myelin basic protein (Boehringer-Ingelheim) were used to identify astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Cryosections (12 μm) were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS at room temperature, washed in PBS (three times for 5 min each), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100). After washing away the primary antibody, sections were first incubated at room temperature for 1 h with an anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) bridging antibody diluted 1:100 in dilution buffer, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the alkaline phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase complex diluted 1:100. Sections were then washed with PBS, stained for alkaline phosphatase for 20 min, dehydrated, mounted, and photographed on an Axiophot microscope. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 5% fetal calf serum. For transient transfection by the calcium phosphate method, 2.5 × 105 cells/well were plated on six-well plates. After 24 h, DNA mixture (200 μl) containing 0.1 μg of PPAR expression plasmid,2 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid CMV-βgal (CLONTECH), 2 μg of the reporter plasmid Cyp2XPalCAT (27Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), and 5 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA was added to each well, and cells were transfected for 12 h. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-treated fetal calf serum, activators were added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were then scraped off the dishes, and total cell extracts were prepared by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. β-Galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities were measured in these extracts by standard methods (28Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Relative CAT activity was calculated as the fold increase in CAT activity over the basal activity obtained with the empty vector in untreated cells. Stock solutions of bezafibrate (Sigma) and L-165041 compound (a gift from Parke-Davis) were prepared in ethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), respectively. The effect of activators on marker enzyme activities were measured on reaggregated cultures, equivalent to one-fourth of the original cultures, treated on day 34 or 35 with either 0.05% ethanol (control-bezafibrate), 0.05% Me2SO (control-L-165041), 10 μm bezafibrate, or 5 and 10 μm L-165041 for 24 h. After treatment, the samples were homogenized in ground glass homogenizers. The marker enzymes used were glutamine synthetase for astrocytes, glutamic acid decarboxylase for GABAergic neurons, and choline acetyltransferase for cholinergic neurons, and they were measured using radiometric methods as described previously (24Honegger P. Monnet-Tschudi F. Fedoroff S. Richardson A. Protocols for Neural Cell Culture. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 25-49Crossref Google Scholar). Determination of protein amounts by the Lowry method was done on replicate cultures representing one-fourth of the original cultures. As PPARs have not been studied so far in the developing postnatal brain, we first characterized the aggregates for the basal level of PPAR mRNAs. We examined these cultures at four ages representing different stages of maturation of neurons and glia (henceforth referred to as differentiation). At day 7 (d7), the cells were undifferentiated; at d21, differentiation of neuron and glia subtypes was ongoing, d35 cultures reached the steady state of differentiation, and d49 represented late cultures with the highest level of neuron-specific parameters, although some demyelination may have already occurred (29Honegger P. Bottenstein J.E. Sato G. Cell Culture in the Neurosciences. Plenum Press, New York1985: 223-243Crossref Google Scholar,30Honegger P. Pardo B. Monnet-Tschudi F. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 105: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The basal levels of the PPAR isotype mRNAs were different in these aggregates. PPARα mRNA was barely detectable by Northern blot analysis but was detected by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, PPARβ mRNA was abundant and could be detected easily by Northern blot analysis of total RNA (Fig. 1 B). Total cellular RNA from adult rat liver and brain was used as a positive control for PPARα and PPARβ, respectively. PPARγ mRNA was not detected in the aggregates even by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown), and therefore, this isotype was not analyzed in subsequent experiments. There was also a different age-dependent pattern of expression of both PPAR isotypes. On the one hand, the PPARβ mRNA basal level was low in undifferentiated cultures (d2 and d7), increased 3–5-fold during differentiation (d14, d21, and d28), and remained high in differentiated (d35) and late (d42 and d49) cultures (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, the level of PPARα mRNA remained low at the four developmental stages examined (Fig. 1,A and C, inset). Thus, of the three PPARs, only the two isotypes α and β were present in the aggregates, and the levels of PPARβ increased with the onset of cell differentiation. In order to identify the cells expressing PPARs in the aggregates, we used in situ hybridization to detect PPAR transcripts in cells (Fig. 2 A), as well as immunohistochemical staining for cell type-specific markers to identify these cells (Fig. 2 B). The marker antigens used for immunohistochemistry were MAP2 for neurons, GFAP for astrocytes, and myelin basic protein for oligodendrocytes. Because MAP2 and GFAP are cytoskeletal proteins, immunostaining for these antigens is seen in the cell bodies and processes, and the in situ hybridization signal of PPAR mRNAs is cytoplasmic. Furthermore, we used thionine staining in parallel sections to visualize the nuclei in the aggregates (Fig. 2, A, q–t, and B, i and k). At d7, a faint signal of PPARα mRNA was detected in most cells of the aggregates (Fig. 2 A, compare a withq). At d21, the signal was slightly stronger and restricted to cells with small nuclei (Fig. 2 A, compare bwith r), which were identified primarily as astrocytes by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 B, compare c withd, h, and l). The pattern was similar at d35 (Fig. 2 A, c). At d49, the same cell type was positive for PPARα but with a decreased signal intensity (Fig. 2 A, d). The sense probe for PPARα did not stain the sections (Fig. 2 A, e–h), indicating that the signal detected with the antisense probe was specific. The in situ hybridization signal for PPARβ was higher than that for PPARα in all developmental stages of the aggregates (Fig. 2 A, compare i–l with a–d). At d7, the PPARβ signal was of medium intensity and was present in most cells of the aggregates (Fig. 2 A, i). At d21, the signal was stronger and exhibited a cell type-specific expression pattern. A signal of very high intensity was observed in cells with large nuclei (Fig. 2 A, compare j with r), which formed a broad layer in the aggregates. Immunostaining with MAP2 revealed that these cells were neurons (Fig. 2 B, compareg with h). A PPARβ signal of medium and high intensity was also observed in the same region of the aggregates in cells with smaller nuclei, which were neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2 B, compare g withd, h, and l). At d35 and d49, the pattern of expression of PPARβ mRNA was similar to that of d21, but the signal intensity was lower (Fig. 2 A, k and l). The peripheral layer of glial cells were positive for PPARβ at all developmental stages except d7 (Fig. 2 B, d andl). Again, the sense probe barely stained the sections (Fig. 2 A, m–p), confirming the specificity of the signal obtained for PPARβ. These results showed that PPARβ mRNA was ubiquitous in the aggregates and high in some neurons, whereas PPARα mRNA was mainly detected in the astrocytes. We used a three-step approach to establish whether ACSs were target genes of PPARβ in this model of the developing rat brain. First, we determined the basal levels of the three ACSs in the aggregates. We then examined their cell type-specific expression pattern, and finally studied whether PPAR activators regulate their expression. All three ACS mRNAs were easily detectable by Northern blot analysis of total RNA (Fig. 3). ACS1 mRNA was present at a low level in the four developmental stages examined. At d21, a small but significant increase of 1.8-fold over the level at d7 was observed (t test, p ≤ 0.05). The basal level of ACS2 mRNA was very low at d7, but it increased 5–7-fold in d21 and d35 cultures and remained steady in the late cultures. In undifferentiated cultures, the basal level of ACS3 mRNA was the highest among the three ACSs, and this increased further 2–3-fold until d49. The increase over the basal level at d7 was statistically significant for ACS2 and ACS3 mRNAs (ttest, p ≤ 0.01). The comparison of the temporal expression pattern of ACS mRNAs with that of PPARs revealed similarities between ACS1 and PPARα mRNAs on one hand and ACS2 and PPARβ mRNAs on the other hand (Figs. 1and 3). We examined by in situ hybridization the cell type-specific pattern of expression of ACS mRNAs and compared it with the immunohistochemical analysis shown in Fig. 2 B. ACS1 mRNA was barely detectable in d7 cultures (Fig. 4 A, a). At d21, a signal of medium intensity was observed in small cells in most regions of the aggregates, which were predominantly astrocytes (Fig. 4 A, band Fig. 2 B, d). The intensity of this signal decreased at d35 and d49 but was still primarily astrocytic (Fig. 4 A, cand d). The glial cells at the periphery of the aggregates did not stain for ACS1 mRNA. ACS2 mRNA signal was higher than that of ACS1 mRNA in the aggregates and was observed in most cells at d7 (Fig. 4 A, e). At d21, the signal was of high intensity in neurons with large nuclei, which form a broad layer in the aggregates. In the same region, a signal of medium intensity was observed in other neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4 A, f). In aggregates of d35 and d49, the ACS2 mRNA signal decreased in intensity (Fig. 4 A, g and h) but was present in the same cell types as observed at d21. ACS3 mRNA was found in most cells of the aggregates at days 7 and 21 (Fig. 4 A, i and j), with a few cells showing a very strong signal. At d35 and d49, the ACS3 mRNA signal decreased in intensity and was observed in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4 A, k and l). Large cells, which stained intensely at d7 and d21, were not apparent in these differentiated cultures. The peripheral layer of glial cells was positive for ACS2 and ACS3 mRNAs in cultures of all developmental stages except d7. No signal was observed with the sense probes for ACS1, ACS2, and ACS3 mRNAs (data not shown). The in situ hybridization analysis of the three ACSs in d21 aggregates was compared with that of PPARβ and is shown at a higher magnification in Fig. 4 B. The expression pattern of ACS2 mRNA was similar to that of PPARβ (Fig. 4 B, b andc). This finding, taken together with their temporal pattern of expression, suggested that ACS2 might be a target gene of PPARβ. To test whether ACS2 was a PPARβ target gene, a PPAR activator was required that preferentially activates rPPARβ. In a recent study from our laboratory, several compounds were screened with the coactivator-dependent receptor ligand assay. Fatty acids, eicosanoids, and hypolipidemic drugs were identified as ligands for Xenopus PPARs (27Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Most of the ligands identified for xPPARβ by this assay exhibited similar or greater activity toward xPPARα. As bezafibrate, which was strong on xPPARβ, was the least active on xPPARα, we tested this hypolipidemic drug on rPPARs in a reporter gene assay in HeLa cells. Transfection of the PPARα expression vector resulted in an apparent ligand independent activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 5 A), which has been observed previously in HeLa cells (31Dreyer C. Keller H. Mahfoudi A. Laudet V. Krey G. Wahli W. Biol. Cell. 1993; 77: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In cells treated with 10 and 100 μm bezafibrate, PPARα-mediated transcription of the reporter gene was enhanced. In contrast, expression of PPARβ did not affect the basal activity of the reporter, and treatment with the 100 μm bezafibrate activated the reporter gene only weakly. Thus, at a concentration of 10 μm, bezafibrate can be used as a specific activator of rPPARα. L-165041 compound has been recently identified as a human PPARβ"

To establish the role of apoE in the regulation of hepatic VLDL production, the human APOE3 gene was introduced into apoE-deficient mice by cross-breeding with APOE3 transgenics (APOE3/apoe−/− mice) or by adenoviral transduction. APOE3 was expressed in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in brain, spleen, and lung of transgenic APOE3/apoe−/− mice similar to endogenous apoe. Plasma cholesterol levels in APOE/apoe−/− mice (3.4 ± 0.5 mm) were reduced when compared with apoe−/− mice (12.6 ± 1.4 mm) but still elevated when compared with wild type control values (1.9 ± 0.1 mm). Hepatic triglyceride accumulation in apoE-deficient mice was completely reversed by introduction of the APOE3 transgene. The in vivo hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production rate was reduced to 36% of control values in apoE-deficient mice but normalized in APOE3/apoe−/− mice. Hepatic secretion of apoB was not affected in either of the strains. Secretion of 3H-labeled triglycerides synthesized from [3H]glycerol by cultured hepatocytes from apoE-deficient mice was four times lower than by APOE3/apoe−/− or control hepatocytes. The average size of secreted VLDL particles produced by cultured apoE-deficient hepatocytes was significantly reduced when compared with those of APOE3/apoe−/− and wild type mice. Hepatic expression of human APOE3 cDNA via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE-deficient mice resulted in a reduction of plasma cholesterol depending on plasma apoE3 levels. The in vivoVLDL-triglyceride production rate in these mice was increased up to 500% compared with LacZ-injected controls and correlated with the amount of apoE3 per particle. These findings indicate a regulatory role of apoE in hepatic VLDL-triglyceride secretion, independent from its role in lipoprotein clearance.

Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Vlijmen B.J.M. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Kuipers F. van Ree J.M. Hofker M.H.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to a 50–60% reduced production of VLDL-associated triglycerides by the liver (6Kuipers F. Lin Y. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Vlijmen B.J.M. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that apoE may have a physiological function in the VLDL production cascade. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether introduction of apoE into apoE-deficient hepatocytes would actually stimulate hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production in a dose-dependent fashion. Therefore, the human APOE3 gene was introduced into apoE-deficient mice, either through cross-breeding of apoE-deficient mice with transgenic mice expressing APOE3 or through adenovirus-mediated transduction with human APOE3 cDNA. The results of these studies are compatible with our hypothesis that apoE exerts a regulatory function in hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production in the mouse, independent from its role in lipoprotein uptake. Transgenic mice expressing human APOE3 were generated according to Hogan et al. (14Hogan B. Constatini Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), using a DNA construct obtained from plasmid pJS276 (kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Smith, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY) as described previously (2Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E.H. van Gorp P.J.J. Breuer M.L. Mol M.J.T.M. van der Zee A. Frants R.R. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Transgenic offspring was identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blot analysis on genomic tail-derived DNA. Six founders were obtained from which one strain, exhibiting high expression of human APOE3 in liver, was bred with C57BL/6J. Homozygous APOE3 transgenic mice of the F1 generation were cross-bred with apoE-deficient mice to obtain APOE3/apoe−/− mice. The resulting offspring was analyzed for the presence of apoE3 by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the endogenousapoe−/− genotype through tail tip DNA analysis, as described earlier (7van Ree J.M. van den Broek W.J.A.A. Dahlmans V.E.H. Groot P.H.E. Vidgeon-Hart M. Frants R.R. Wierenga B. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 111: 25-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a light- and temperature-controlled environment. Food and tap water was available ad libitum. The animals were fed a commercial lab chow (RMH-B, Hope Farms BV, Woerden, The Netherlands) containing 6.2% fat and approximately 0.01% cholesterol (w/w). Male mice were used throughout the study at 3–4 months of age. The animals received humane care, and experimental protocols complied with local guidelines for use of experimental animals. The generation of the recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing either human APOE3 (Ad-APOE3) (15Kashyap V.S. Santamarina Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrot C.L. Applebaum Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G.D.

S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promotor has previously been described. The Ad-APOE3 was kindly provided by Dr. S. Santamarina Fojo (Betheseda, MD) and Ad-β-Gal by Dr. J. Hertz (Dallas, TX). The recombinant adenovirus was propagated and titrated in a way similar to that already described (17Jong M.C. Dahlmans V.E.H. van Gorp P.J.J. Willems van Dijk K.W. Breuer M.L. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For storage, the virus was supplemented with mouse serum albumin (0.2%) and glycerol (10%). The aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Routine virus dilution of the stocks varied from 1–5 × 1010/ml. For in vivo adenovirus transductions, 1 × 109 to 2 × 109 plaque forming units in a total volume of 200 μl (diluted with phosphate-buffered saline) were injected into the tail vein of apoE-deficient mice. Five days after virus injection, mice were fasted for 4 h prior to measurement of VLDL-triglyceride production. Triton WR 1339 was injected intravenously, and blood samples were drawn from the tail vein at timed intervals, as described below. Total RNA was isolated from brain, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, skin, and spleen using the RNA Instapture System (Eurogentec S.A., Seraing, Belgium). RNA samples (7.5 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis through a denaturing agarose gel (1% w/v) containing 7.5% formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were subsequently hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe of human APOE (18Zannis V.I. McPherson J. Goldberger G. Krathanasis S.K. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5495-5499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 53 °C in a solution of 50% formamide and of 18 S (19Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar) at 65 °C in a solution containing 0.5 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 7% SDS (w/v). In a different set of experiments, the amounts of human APOE3 mRNA in livers of APOE3 transgenic mice and adenovirus-transducted mice were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The amounts of human APOE3 mRNA were related to the level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (20Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur O. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). For immunoelectron microscopic studies, livers were processed essentially as described by Hamilton et al. (21Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for rat liver. In short, mice were anesthetized with halothane, followed by perfusion-fixation of the liver via the portal vein with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Perfusion was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Following fixation, livers were sliced and washed with 6.8% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, incubated in 2.3 m sucrose for at least 2 h at 4 °C, and then mounted on copper pins. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Cryosections (∼80 nm) were made using an LKB-Reichert-Jung ultracryomicrotome (Leica, Rijswijk, the Netherlands) with a glass knife and were immunolabeled with goat anti-human APOE3 antibody (1:1000 dilution). Antibody binding was detected with 6-nm gold particles conjugated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:30 dilution). Sections were stained, covered with a methylcellulose uranylacetate mixture (0.3% uranylacetate), air dried, and stored at room temperature. Sections were examined using an EM 201 transmission electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands) operated at 80 kV. Groups of 5–6 mice were anesthetized with halothane. A large blood sample for determination of plasma lipids was collected by cardiac puncture. Subsequently, the liver was quickly removed, weighed, and immediately frozen in separate portions in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation and lipid analysis, respectively. Parts of livers used for microscopical examination were stored in paraformaldehyde or slowly frozen in isopentane. Frozen sections were stained with Oil-Red-O for detection of neutral fat. Hepatic and plasma concentrations of triglycerides and free and total cholesterol were measured using commercial kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Phospholipid concentrations in liver tissue were determined as described (6Kuipers F. Lin Y. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Vlijmen B.J.M. Vonk R.J.

Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The plasma concentrations of lathosterol, β-sitosterol, and campesterol were determined by capillary gas chromatography on a Hewlett Packard HP5890 gas chromatograph, as described previously (23Wolthers B.G.

Plasma lipoproteins were separated by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a Superose 6B column as described previously (24van Vlijmen B.J.M. van't Hof H.B. Mol M.J.T.M. van der Boom H. van der Zee A. Frants R.R. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1184-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ApoE3 levels in total plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (7van Ree J.M. van den Broek W.J.A.A. Dahlmans V.E.H. Groot P.H.E. Vidgeon-Hart M. Frants R.R. Wierenga B. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 111: 25-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fast protein liquid chromatography samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) according to Laemlli (25Laemlli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was performed by ECL-Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions provided. Hepatic production of VLDL-triglycerides was measured in control,apoe−/−, and APOE3/apoe−/− mice after intravenous injection of Triton WR 1339, exactly as described (26Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were fasted for 16 h prior to the experiments, and 12.5 mg of Triton WR 1339 in 100 μl phosphate-buffered saline was injected via the penile vein. Tail vein blood samples were taken under light halothane anesthesia before and at 1, 2, and 3 h after Triton injection for triglyceride measurements. Liver weights and body weights were carefully recorded. Hepatic production rates of VLDL apoB-100 and of B-48 were determined according to Li et al. (26Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 350–400 μl of plasma obtained at 3 h after Triton WR 1339 injection was adjusted to 1 ml with a NaCl/NaBr solution of density 1.019 g/ml containing 1 mmEDTA and NaN3 and centrifuged at 120,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima™ 102.2 rotor for 100 min at 4 °C (27Pietzsch J. Subat S. Nitzsche S. Leonhardt W. Schentke K.K. Haneveld M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The VLDL was isolated by tube slicing, and the recovered volume was measured by weight. VLDL protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, simultaneously with four dilutions of human low density lipoprotein apoB (0.525, 1.05, 1.58, and 2.1 μg) prepared as described previously (28Jialal I. Fuller C.J. Huet B.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). VLDL apoB-100 and B-48 was quantified by laser densitometry (Imagemaster, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and comparison with standards. Three mice per group were used for apoB base-line analysis. Hepatic production rates were determined as described (26Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse hepatocyte isolation and culturing was done as described previously (6Kuipers F. Lin Y. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Vlijmen B.J.M. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,29Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In short, the portal vein was cannulated with a 22-gauge plastic cannula. The liver was perfused with a calcium-free HBSS containing 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4), pregassed with 95% O2/5% CO2, at a flow rate of 4.5 ml/min. This was followed by perfusion of the liver with a collagenase solution (20 mg/125 ml calcium (5 mm)-containing Hank's balanced salt solution) until swelling of the liver was observed. Hepatocytes were gently released from the surrounding capsule and washed with Krebs buffer containing 10 mm Hepes and 10 mm glucose and with Williams' E medium. Cells were plated in 35-mm 6-well plastic dishes (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), precoated with collagen (Serva Feinbiochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of Williams' E medium containing insulin, fetal calf serum, dexamethason, and penicillin/streptomycin. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed, and hepatocytes were washed twice with fetal calf serum- and hormone-free (SF-HF) medium and subsequently incubated for four hours in 2 ml SF-HF medium. Cells were then incubated in SF-HF medium containing 4.4 μCi of [3H]glycerol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; final volume, 25 μm) for 3 h with or without 0.75 mmoleate (C18:1) complexed with bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 0.25 mm) to stimulate hepatocytic lipogenesis. After a 3-h incubation period, the medium was collected and centrifuged to remove debris, and lipids were extracted as described previously (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were washed three times and scraped into 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for lipid extractions. Lipids from medium and hepatocytes were dissolved in chloroform with 2 mm tripalmitin added as a carrier. Triglycerides were separated from other lipids by TLC with hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (80/20/1, v/v/v) as developing solvent. Tripalmitin containing spots were scraped and dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid and assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Hepatocytes were incubated for 24 h in SF-HF medium containing 0.75 mmoleic acid complexed to albumin. Medium from 6 wells (∼6 × 106 hepatocytes) was pooled, and VLDL was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation after addition of 0.35 g of KBr/ml medium. A salt solution of 1.0063 g/ml (containing 0.2m NaCl and 270 μm Na-EDTA) was layered upon the medium, and centrifugation was performed for 24 h at 24.000 rpm and 4 °C in a TST41–14 rotor in a Centricon T-1080 ultracentrifuge (Milan, Italy). VLDL particles thus obtained were allowed to adhere to hydrophilic carbon films and immersed in 1% potassium phosphotungstate (pH 7.4) as a negative stain. Electron micrographs were obtained in a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Size distribution, based on measurement of at least 1600 particles per strain, was determined using Quantimet 520+ software (Leica, Cambridge, UK). Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry et al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as standard. Analyses of data from the three groups (APOE3/apoe−/−, apoe−/−, and control) were performed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by the post-hoc Student Newman-Keuls test. Comparisons of data from two groups were performed using the Student's t test, when appropriate. To check distribution of APOE3 expression in the transgenic mice, total mRNA was isolated from various organs. Northern blot analysis showed that the APOE3/apoe−/− mice express human APOE3 in liver, lungs, and spleen. To a lesser extent, expression was also observed in brain, muscle, heart, and skin (Fig. 1). A similar expression pattern has been reported for endogenousapoe in mice (32Srivastava R.A. Bhasin N Srivastava N. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar, 33Reue K.L.

Levels of human apoE3 in plasma were only 61.2 ± 5.3 μg/dl. For comparison, levels of endogenous apoE in C57BL/6 mice are 6.8 ± 0.2 mg/dl (34Lusis A.J. Taylor B.A. Quon D. Zollman S. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7594-7604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic studies were performed to determine the localization of apoE3 in livers of the transgenic mice. Particularly perivenous hepatocytes were strongly labeled at their microvilli lining the sinusoidal membranes (Fig. 2 A). Multivesicular bodies contained apoE3 (Fig. 2 B), in line with the role of apoE in remnant uptake. Association of apoE3 with budding Golgi and trans-Golgi structures was also observed, mainly with electron lucent material (Fig. 2 C). Peroxisomes (Fig. 2 D) were labeled in the characteristic, cluster-like fashion previously described for endogenous apoE in rat liver by Hamilton et al. (21Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On regular low fat/low cholesterol lab chow, plasma cholesterol levels in APOE3/apoe−/− mice were slightly higher than those in controls but much lower than inapoe−/− mice (Table I). Plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid levels were similar across all groups (Table I). Separation of plasma lipoproteins using Superose 6B revealed that the characteristic elevation of cholesterol in the VLDL-sized lipoprotein fractions in apoe−/− mice was largely reversed by introduction of APOE3 (Fig. 3). Yet cholesterol levels were still elevated in the VLDL- and intermediate density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein-sized fractions, suggesting that defective clearance of remnant particles in apoE-deficient mice is not completely restored by introduction of low levels of apoE3 (∼1% of mouse apoE level). ApoE3 was present in all lipoprotein fractions (data not shown).Table IPlasma lipid concentrations in chow-fed wild type (C57BL/6J), apoe−/−, and APOE3/apoe−/− miceTriglyceridesTotal cholesterolFree fatty acidsmmmmmmWild type0.20 ± 0.071.87 ± 0.140.58 ± 0.24apoe−/−0.40 ± 0.1912.55 ± 1.40aSignificant difference from control values (p < 0.05).0.51 ± 0.01APOE3/apoe−/−0.43 ± 0.273.41 ± 0.23aSignificant difference from control values (p < 0.05).0.61 ± 0.12a Significant difference from control values (p < 0.05).

Open table in a new tab Table IIIsummarizes the contents of triglycerides, free cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters in livers of wild type, apoe−/−, and APOE3/apoe−/− animals. Although cholesteryl esters were unchanged, triglyceride and free cholesterol concentrations were elevated in apoE-deficient mice when compared with controls, as shown before (6Kuipers F. Lin Y. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Jong M.C. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Vlijmen B.J.M. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 241-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is evident that hepatic fat accumulation associated with apoE deficiency in the mouse is completely prevented by APOE3 expression. In fact, the hepatic triglyceride content even tended to be lower in the APOE3/apoe−/− animals than in the controls.Table IIIHepatic triglyceride, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester concentrations in chow-fed wild type (C57BL/6J), apoe−/−, and APOE3/apoe−/− miceTriglyceridesFree cholesterolCholesteryl estersnmol/mg livernmol/mg livernmol/mg liverWild type20.6 ± 6.24.2 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.1apoe−/−64.1 ± 22.8aStatistically significant difference from WT en APOE3/apoe−/− levels (p < 0.05).5.2 ± 0.6aStatistically significant difference from WT en APOE3/apoe−/− levels (p < 0.05).2.0 ± 1.0APOE3/apoe−/−12.9 ± 3.83.9 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.5a Statistically significant difference from WT en APOE3/apoe−/− levels (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Livers of apoE-deficient mice show a very characteristic pattern of fat disposition in perivenous hepatocytes, i.e. in the cells surrounding the central vein (Fig. 4). As expected, this pattern was absent in the APOE3/apoe−/− animals. No abnormalities in livers of these mice could be detected by routine histological examination. Hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production rate was measured in vivo after intravenous injection of Triton WR 1339 after an overnight fast (Table IV). The VLDL-triglyceride production rate was reduced from 108 ± 22 μmol/kg/h in wild type controls to 35 ± 7 μmol/kg/h in apoE-deficient mice (p< 0.005). The production rate in APOE3/apoe−/− mice was highly comparable with that in control mice.Table IVThe in vivo VLDL-triglyceride and apoB production rates in chow-fed wild type (C57BL/6J), apoe−/−, and APOE3/apoe−/− miceTG PRapoB pool sizeapoB PRB48B100B48B100μmol/kg/hμgμgμg/hμg/hWild type108 ± 225.2 ± 1.88.9 ± 1.930.2 ± 4.026.6 ± 7.3apoe−/−35 ± 7aSignificant difference from wild type control.417 ± 103aSignificant difference from wild type control.51.0 ± 20.5aSignificant difference from wild type control.29.0 ± 17.915.6 ± 11.6APOE3/apoe−/−104 ± 2738.4 ± 11.5aSignificant difference from wild type control.11.3 ± 5.329.1 ± 22.115.8 ± 9.1a Significant difference from wild type control. Open table in a new tab Hepatic production of apoB48 and apoB100 was determined in separate groups of mice according to Li et al. (26Li X. Catalina F. Grundy S.M. Patel S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 210-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pool size of apoB100 and in particular of apoB48 was expanded in apoE-deficient mice. Introduction of APOE3 decreased apoB100 pool size to control values, as shown in Table IV. The pool size of apoB48 in APOE3/apoe−/− mice was larger than in controls. The production rate of B48 was similar among all groups, whereas the production rate of B100 was slightly but not significantly lower in apoE-deficient and APOE3/apoe−/− mice than in the controls. To fully exclude potential interference of nonhepatocytic factors that may influence the VLDL production process in vivo, VLDL-triglyceride secretion was also studied in hepatocytes in primary culture using [3H]glycerol labeling. Fig. 5 shows the percentage of newly synthesized 3H-labeled triglyceride secreted into the medium by cells isolated from the three mouse strains. Secretion of VLDL-associated 3H-labeled triglyceride into the culture medium was clearly decreased for apoE-deficient cells when compared with control cells both in the absence and presence of oleate. In contrast, VLDL-3H-labeled triglyceride secretion by APOE3/apoe−/− cells was similar or even higher than that by control cells, indicating that the presence of APOE3 fully restores the capacity of VLDL-triglyceride secretion in apoE-deficient hepatocytes in vitro. Fig. 6 shows that the average size of VLDL particles produced by cultured apoe−/− hepatocytes was less than that of particles produced by control cells and by APOE3/apoe−/− cells. In the latter case, the size distribution curve showed a clear skewing toward larger particle sizes when compared with controls. It should be noted that partial lipolysis of secreted VLDL particles during the 24-h incubation period may have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2057089327,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor implicated in the regulation of body weight. Genetic studies in humans have identified two frameshift mutations of MC4R associated with a dominantly inherited form of obesity. We have generated and expressed the corresponding MC4R mutants in 293T cells and found that cells transfected with the truncation mutants failed to exhibit agonist binding or responsiveness despite retention of structural motifs potentially sufficient for binding and signaling. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the mutant proteins were expressed and localized in the intracellular compartment but absent from the plasma membrane, suggesting that these mutations disrupted the proper cellular transport of MC4R. Further studies identified a sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of MC4R necessary for the cell surface targeting. We further investigated a possible dominant-negative activity of the mutants on wild-type receptor function. Co-transfection studies showed that the mutants affected neither signaling nor cell surface expression of wild-type MC4R. We also characterized three human sequence variants of MC4R, but these exhibited identical affinities for peptide ligands and identical agonist responsiveness. Thus, unlike the obesity-associated MC4R truncation mutants, the polymorphisms of MC4R are unlikely to be contributors to human obesity."

PH domains can be classified into three groups based on their different lipid binding specificities. Distinct 3-phosphoinositides can accumulate upon PI 3-kinase activation in cells in response to different stimuli and mediate specific cellular responses. In Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, oxidative stress induced by 1 mmH2O2 caused almost exclusive accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), whereas osmotic stress increased both phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels. The increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels, caused by oxidative stress, correlated with the activation of protein kinase B, which has a promiscuous PH domain that binds both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2. p70 S6 kinase, another signaling component downstream of PI 3-kinase, however, was not activated by this oxidative stress-induced increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels. Increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2levels in response to osmotic stress did not correlate with protein kinase B activation, because of concomitant activation of an inhibitory pathway, but p70 S6 kinase was activated by osmotic stress. These results demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4)P2 can accumulate independently of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and exerts a pattern of cellular responses that is distinct from that induced by accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Based on structural features and substrate specificity, three classes of catalytic subunits of PI 3-kinases have so far been recognized (2Van Haesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 3Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The Type I class, members of which phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro but utilize PtdIns(4,5)P2 as the likely substrate in vivo, is subdivided into Type Ia and Type 1b. Type Ia PI 3-kinases interact with adaptor proteins containing SH2 domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues, linking this class to tyrosine kinase signaling cascades. Type 1b PI 3-kinases are stimulated by G-protein βγ subunits and do not interact with SH2 domain containing adaptor proteins but with p101, a novel adaptor protein that has no homology with known proteins. Type II PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PtdIns and PtdIns4P in vitro (and not PtdIns(4,5)P2) and contain a C2 domain, implicated in lipid binding. Type III PI 3-kinases only phosphorylate PtdIns and are thought to be constitutively active. They can be recruited and regulated by their adaptor, a dual specificity protein kinase, with which they form heterodimers. The principle enzymatic activity of PI 3-kinases involves the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides on the 3-position of the inositol ring, resulting in the formation of 3-phosphoinositides, which can either directly interact with appropriate modules of specific target proteins or first undergo further phosphorylation. Examples of the latter mechanism include the observation that in platelets, PtdIns3P can be phosphorylated by a PtdIns3P 4-kinase activity to give PtdIns(3,4)P2, which activates PKB (4Banfic H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and in yeast, a PtdIns3P 5-kinase activity encoded by the FAB1p gene has been shown to be essential for vacuolar functioning (5Cooke F.T.

FYVE domains are the structural modules that specifically bind PtdIns3P (6Gaullier J. Simonson A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R.

More than 100 different proteins containing PH domains have been identified, and the majority require membrane association for their function, which is mediated via interaction with phosphoinositides. PH domains can be assigned to one of three groups based on their affinities for PtdIns(4,5)P2, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (or their polar headgroup), although many details involved in binding specificity still have to be elucidated (8Kavran J.M.

Modelling of PH domains, based on sequence alignments, resolved crystal structures, and binding studies, are beginning to allow predictions of binding specifities and hence likely physiological ligands. Cells respond to different extracellular inputs from their environment by activation of protein kinase cascades. These complex networks allow amplification of the signal and can mediate the required diversity of cellular responses. The classical MAP kinase pathway is activated by agonists that include growth factors and tumor-promoting agents and the SAPK/p38 pathway is activated by cellular stresses and inflammatory cytokines. PI 3-kinases can mediate cellular responses to stress, but their direct role and the mechanism of activation is not well defined. There are relatively few reports on direct activation of PI 3-kinase upon exposure to cellular stresses. Heat shock and oxidative stress have both been reported to activate PI 3-kinase activity directly in NIH 3T3 cells (10Lin R.Z. Hu Z-W. Chin J.H. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol.

The involvement of PI 3-kinase in stress responses inferred by activation of PKB or other downstream signaling components, however, can be misleading as demonstrated by the following two observations in this report. Firstly, wortmannin-sensitive PKB activation was strongly enhanced upon H2O2 treatment in the absence of a detectable increase of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Secondly, osmotic shock greatly increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentrations, which did not result in the expected strong activation of PKB. Because oxidative stress induced by direct exposure of cells to H2O2 results in a complex array of signaling events and osmotic shock activates many different components of several kinase cascades (16Cohen P.

This report shows the accumulation of distinct PI 3-kinase lipid products, in response to oxidative stress and osmotic shock upon treatment of Swiss3T3 mouse fibroblasts with 1 mmH2O2 and 0.5 m sucrose, respectively. These products result in the activation of different metabolic pathways and lead to distinct patterns of cellular response. Whereas oxidative stress caused a sustained accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and to subsequent activation of PKB but not of p70 S6 kinase, osmotic shock increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3concentration and subsequent activation of p70 S6 kinase but did not activate PKB. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and Enhanced Chemoluminescence kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]Inositol was from NEN Life Science Products. Partisphere SAX column was from Whatman. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and protein G-agarose were from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody G410 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep/goat antibody was from Scottish Antibody Production Unit, whereas the PKBα C-terminal antibody and the anti-PKB Ser(P)473 antibody, both raised in sheep, were a gift from the Medical Research Council protein phosphorylation unit in Dundee. Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were grown to confluence in 6-well plates (sometimes in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for parallel comparison with cell labeling experiments; see below). Prior to treatment, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of modified Krebs Henseleit (KRH) buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, and 2% D(+)-glucose) and then conditioned for 60 min in 3 ml of KRH buffer in a 37 °C waterbath. Cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml IGF-1, 1 mmH2O2, and 0.5 m sucrose for the indicated times, after which the medium was aspirated and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis-buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm di-sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmbenzamidin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. Cells were scraped on ice, and the lysates were transferred into Eppendorf tubes and spun for 1 min at 20,800 × g. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. 1 μg of PKB antibody coupled to 5 μl of protein G-agarose beads was added to each sample. After 90 min on a shaking platform at 4 °C, the beads were spun down, the supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were washed twice with ice-cold lysis-buffer containing 0.5m NaCl and twice with ice-cold wash-buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.03% Brij-35, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). After the last wash, the buffer was removed carefully to a volume of ∼10 μl, and the reaction was started by adding 50 μl of assay-buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, 50 μm Crosstide (PKB substrate peptide), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform, the reactions were terminated by pipetting the suspension onto 2.5 × 2.5-cm phosphocellulose papers that were washed four times for 15 min in 0.5%ortho-phosphoric acid and then washed once with acetone. The dried filters were counted for radioactivity in 4 ml of scintillant (FloScint IV). Measurement of p70 S6 kinase was done exactly as described for the PKB assay except that the antibody was raised against p70 S6 kinase, and the substrate peptide used was KKRNRTLTV at 100 μm. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell lysates, andin vitro activity was measured as follows. After treatment (described above) the cell medium was aspirated, ice-cold lysis-buffer was added, cells were scraped, and the lysates were spun for 2 min at 20,800 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1 μg/sample) was precoupled to protein G-agarose beads (5 μl/sample) and added to each sample. After 90 min on a shaking platform at 4 °C, the beads were spun down, the supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis-buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with 1 ml of assay buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). 40 μl of 2× assay buffer, 10 μl of lipid vesicles, and 20 μl of H2O was then added to each 20 μl of beads. Lipid vesicles were prepared by drying PtdIns and phosphatidyl serine down, resuspending them in 0.5 ml of lipid buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1m NaCl) to a final concentration of 1 mm each. Vesicles were made by four blasts of 15 s with a probe sonicator at a power setting of 50%, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Reactions were started by adding 10 μl of 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay) and incubated for 20 min on a platform shaker at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with 0.75 ml of CHCl3:MeOH:concentrated HCl (40:80:1), and two phases were obtained by adding 0.25 ml of CHCl3 and 0.35 ml of 0.1m HCl. After centrifugation the upper phase was aspirated, and the organic phase was washed twice with 0.5 ml of synthetic upper phase and dried down. The lipids were analyzed by TLC on silica 60 plates using CHCl3:MeOH:ammonia:H2O (75:100:15:25) as the mobile phase. The bands were visualized by autoradiography and scraped, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates at 104cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without inositol and supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with 4 ml of fresh medium containing 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol and left for 48 h. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of KRH and then conditioned for 60 min in 3 ml of KRH buffer in a 37 °C waterbath. Cells were treated as described above but quenched with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), scraped on ice and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The wells were rinsed once with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the particulate material was pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 20,800 × g). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid/1 mm EDTA. The lipids were extracted on ice for 20 min in 0.75 ml of CHCl3:MeOH:concentrated HCl (40:80:1). Two phases were obtained by adding 0.25 ml of CHCl3 and 0.45 ml of 0.1 m HCl to the samples, which were thoroughly vortexed and spun for 2 min at 17,500 × g. The lower, organic phases were transferred to screw cap tubes containing 50 μl of 1m ammonia in methanol. The upper phases and interphases were re-extracted once with 0.5 ml of synthetic lower phase, and the organic phases were pooled, dried down in a vacuum concentrator, and stored at −80 °C. The deacylation was carried out as described in Ref. 19Clark N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, and the glycerophosphoinositolphosphates were analyzed by HPLC using a Partisphere SAX column (5-μm mesh size; 4.6 × 250 mm). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with 5 min H2O followed by a gradient made from H2O to 1m NH4H2PO4 (pH 3.8 withortho-phosphoric acid) in 100 min with an increment of 1%/min. Three fractions/min were collected, to each of which 3 ml of scintillant was added, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter.

Recombinant GST-GAP1IP4BP (expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose beads) replaced crude cerebellar membrane from sheep. Total cellular lipids were isolated from confluent 6-well plates as described above. Cell lysates were obtained exactly as described for the PKB activity assay. Approximately 20 μg of cytosolic protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 2 gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. One membrane was incubated with the anti-PKBα C-terminal antibody, and the other was incubated with anti-PKB Ser(P)473 antibody each at 1 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20, 3% dried milk. The secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep/goat antibody allowed visualization by enhanced chemoluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol. The potential of cellular stresses to activate the PI 3-kinase pathway was investigated using a radioligand displacement assay that specifically measures PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Exposure of Swiss3T3 mouse fibroblasts to osmotic stress and heat shock increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels, but oxidative stress or treatment with anisomycin or UV irradiation did not (Fig. 1; data for heat shock, anisomycin, and UV radiation not shown). These cellular stresses were subsequently tested for their ability to activate PKB, which, both in vitro and in vivo, requires binding of either PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2 to its PH domain (22Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 23Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Consistent with the measured increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration, heat shock-activated PKB (14Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), but surprisingly, osmotic stress did not activate PKB, despite causing a wortmannin-sensitive increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production. UV radiation and anisomycin, which did not increase the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration, as expected showed no effect on PKB activity (14Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Exposure to oxidative stress, however, strongly activated PKB, without significantly increasing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels (Figs. 1and 2). Oxidative stress activates stress-activated MAP kinase cascades, including that culminating in MAPKAP-K2 activation (16Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), which has been shown to activate PKBα 5-fold in vitro by phosphorylating Ser473 (24Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell F.B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) but was not responsible for PKB activationin vivo for the following reasons. The activation of PKB by oxidative stress was completely insensitive to the specific inhibitor SB203580, which prevents activation of MAPKAP-K2 through inhibition of p38 MAP kinase, its upstream activator. Moreover, other cellular stresses that activated MAPKAP-K2 to the same extent as oxidative stress failed to activate PKB (14Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). MAPKAP-K2, therefore, is unlikely to account for the oxidative stress-induced activation of PKB that occurs in the absence of a detectable increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The observation that PKB activation stimulated by oxidative stress in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts did not coincide with increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels when measured with a radioligand displacement assay called for a more detailed investigation. The increase in PKB activity in these cells upon treatment with 1 mm H2O2 has a slow onset and is transient, reaching a maximum at 20 min and declining to basal levels by 60 min. By contrast, IGF-1 stimulation of Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts did cause an increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3levels, which closely paralleled increased PKB activity (Figs. 1 and2). Two possible explanations are that oxidative stress activated PI 3-kinase but a subsequent, significant PtdIns(3,4,5)P3increase was too small to be detected or that the concentration of an alternative activator, such as PtdIns(3,4)P2, increased in the absence of a detectable rise in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3levels. To address these possibilities, the activity state of PI 3-kinase upon treatment with H2O2 was measured in vitro in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Fig. 4 shows that IGF-1 strongly stimulated anti-phosphotyrosine associated PI 3-kinase activity, whereas H2O2 treatment resulted in a very small but significant increase at 10 min that was not detected at 30 min. Studies on the mechanism of PKB activation have revealed that full activity of the enzyme requires phosphorylation on both Thr308 and Ser473, probably mediated by PDK1 (25Balendran A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R.A. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events are preceded by binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2 to the PH domain of PKB. This not only serves to localize PKB to the plasma membrane but also exposes the phosphorylation sites to PDK1, which itself is constitutively localized at this site via its own PH domain (26Currie R.A. Walker K.S. Gray A. Deak M. Casamayor A. Downes CP. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Lucocq J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The question of whether PKB was phosphorylated upon oxidative stress was addressed by Western blot analysis using an antibody that specifically recognizes PKBα which is phosphorylated at the Ser473 residue. Fig. 3 A, shows that IGF-1 and H2O2 specifically stimulated the phosphorylation of the Ser473 residue of PKB as indicated by the visualization of the expected 66-kDa protein band. Shown in Fig. 3 B, parallel samples analyzed with antibody raised against the C terminus of PKBα, showed that there was no difference in total PKB content. To address the possibility that increased PtdIns(3,4)P2levels account for the activation of PKB in response to oxidative stress, cells were radiolabeled with [3H]inositol as described under “Methods.” After extraction and deacylation of the cellular lipids, subsequent HPLC analysis of the glycerophosphoinositolphosphates revealed that IGF-1 treatment caused a large increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels (Table I). The very small increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels after 10 min of H2O2 treatment detected by this more sensitive approach was not detectable after 30 min and correlated well with the measured in vitro PI 3-kinase activity shown in Fig. 4. The PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels however where highly elevated at both 10 and 30 min after treatment with H2O2. This PtdIns(3,4)P2accumulation was reflected by the increased PKB activity measured in parallel samples (Fig. 2).Table I3-Phosphoinositide levels in response to IGF-1, oxidative, and osmotic stress in Swiss 3T3 cellsPtdIns3PPtdIns(3,4)P2PtdIns(3,4,5)P3Control15902 ± 377ND185 ± 94IGF-117641 ± 659516 ± 1632157 ± 304H2O210′10506 ± 6473610 ± 516562 ± 209H2O2 30′11596 ± 20273782 ± 217187 ± 80Sucrose 10′54381 ± 2152402 ± 8768 ± 137Sucrose 30′46355 ± 3696841 ± 327528 ± 108 Open table in a new tab These results were confirmed in intact cells transfected with green fluorescent protein/PH domain constructs, using the PH domain of PKB, which recognizes both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2, or the PH domain of GRP1, which recognizes only PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (27Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.L. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At 30 min after stimulation with IGF-1 both GFP-PH(PKB) and GFP-PH(GRP1) translocated to the plasma membrane, but after 30 min of exposure to H2O2, only GFP-PH(PKB) was translocated to the plasma membrane, and GFP-PH(GRP1) was cytosolic. These results will be reported in detail elsewhere. 2Gray, A., Van der Kaay, J., and Downes, C. P.Biochem. J., in press. The relatively selective accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2rather than PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in response to oxidative stress could arise via several possible mechanisms. These might include the dephosphorylation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by 5-phosphatase activity, phosphorylation of PtdIns4P by a PtdIns4P 3-kinase, or phosphorylation of PtdIns3P by a PtdIns3P 4-kinase. The likelyhood of activation of a PtdIns4P 3-kinase was not supported by in vitro PI 3-kinase measurements nor by the cell labeling data, which showed a 4-fold increase in PtdIns4P levels upon H2O2 treatment and not the decrease one would expect if PtdIns4P was the precursor for PtdIns(3,4)P2. Although PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activation could not be ruled out, the observation that PtdIns3P levels were reduced by approximately 40% and that this reduction was proportional to the amount of PtdIns(3,4)P2 produced (see Fig. 2) strongly suggested activation of a PtdIns3P 4-kinase activity. In platelets such an enzyme activity has already been demonstrated (4Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and appears to account for the selective accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2that occurs in these cells in response to the cross-linking of activated αIIbβ3 integrin by fibrinogen. Here too the formation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 was wortmannin-sensitive because of the inhibition of the PtdIns 3-kinase that produces its precursor, PtdIns3P. The effect of oxidative stress on p70 S6 kinase activity, a signaling molecule whose activation usually requires PI 3-kinase activity, was also investigated. Although the regulation of p70 S6 kinase activity is not yet fully understood, several reports have suggested roles for the PI 3-kinase signaling molecules, PDK1, Rac, and PKB in its activation (28Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 29Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C.

The interaction of these molecules, and/or their activators, with 3-phosphoinositides is thought to be crucial for their activation. Because oxidative stress leads to increased PtdIns(3,4)P2levels, its potential to activate p70 S6 kinase was examined. Fig. 5 shows that stimulation for 30 min with IGF-1 resulted in a ∼20-fold activation of p70 S6 kinase, which was completely rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive. Treatment with H2O2 for 30 min showed no significant stimulation, suggesting that unlike for the stimulation of PKB, PtdIns(3,4)P2 was not sufficient for p70 S6 kinase activation (treatment for 20 min with H2O2, at which time the transient activation of PKB is maximal, did not activate p70 S6 kinase (not shown)). Although an inhibitory pathway (other than SAPK/p38, because SB20350 did not rescue p70 S6 kinase activation) triggered by H2O2 cannot be ruled out, the results suggest that different patterns of 3-phosphoinositides can elicit distinct downstream responses. PtdIns(3,4)P2 alone appears sufficient for PKB activation, whereas p70 S6 kinase and other responses, perhaps mediated via more selective PH domains like those found in GRP1 and BTK (8Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasaca M. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30497-30508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), require significant production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Although H2O2 has been shown to mimic many of the metabolic effects of insulin (32Czech M.P. Lawrence J.C. Lynn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4173-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), its working mechanism is unknown. Because many growth factor and cytokine receptors contain cysteine-rich motifs (33Heldin C. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar), oxidative stress can exert its effects via sulfhydryl reactivity of these cysteine residues (Cys-SH). Enhancement of the anti-oxidant potential of cells by pretreatment withN-acetyl cysteine and mannitol has indeed been shown to be effective in the inhibition of H2O2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling (12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Osmotic stress increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels in a wortmannin-sensitive manner in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as measured by radioligand displacement (Fig. 1) and cell labeling with [3H]inositol (Table I). This increase in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 concentration was somewhat variable but typically had a magnitude comparable with that of IGF-1 stimulation. The relatively slow onset of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation reached a maximum at 10 min and was sustained at 30 min, which was consistent with the increase of in vitro PI 3-kinase activity, measured in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4). The strong increase in PI 3-kinase activity at 10 and 30 min and the increased PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels were not reflected by the expected large increase in PKB activity measured in parallel samples (Fig. 2). Compartmentalized PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production or activation of an inhibitory pathway might explain this observation. The fact that the IGF-1-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 increase was not additive with that induced by osmotic stress argues against the first possibility. The latter possibility might result from one of the many signaling pathways triggered by osmotic stress, for example, activation of SAPK1/JNK and SAPK2/p38/RK/HOG1 (17Han S.J. Choi K.Y. Brey P.T Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Qin S. Minami Y. Hibi M. Kurosaki T. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2098-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis, using an antibody specifically recognizing Ser473phosphorylated PKBα revealed that upon exposure of cells to an osmotic stress, PKB was not phosphorylated on Ser473 (in contrast to IGF-1 or H2O2 treatment; Fig. 3). To address whether osmotic stress negatively regulates PKB activation, its effect on IGF-1-stimulated PKB activity was tested. The activation of PKB by IGF-1 was strongly inhibited in osmotically stressed cells to 20% of full activation by IGF-1, and when cells stimulated with IGF-1 were subsequently subjected to osmotic stress, the PKB activity was diminished to 60% of the full activity within 1 min (Fig. 6). Because the activity state of PKB will be determined by the balance of its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the effect of osmotic stress could either be via inhibition of phosphorylation or stimulation of dephosphorylation of PKB. Meier et al. (15Meier R. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7294-7303Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) proposed that the profound inhibitory effect on PKB activity exerted by osmotic stress could be mediated by PP2A, which dephosphorylates both Thr308 and Ser473 of PKB. Although no up-regulation of PP2A nor association of PP2A with PKB was detected upon osmotic stress, pretreatment with Calyculin A, a potent inhibitor of PP2A, blocked the inhibitory effect on PKB activation by osmotic stress. We confirmed these data by Meier et al., showing that the inhibition of osmotic stress on the activation of PKB can be blocked by pretreatment with Calyculin A. However, pretreatment for 20 min with 100 μm okadaic acid, another equally potent PP2A inhibitor, failed to do this. 3J. Van der Kaay, unpublished observation. In addition, Calyculin A by itself activated PKB to the same extent as IGF-1.3 Two possible explanations are that Calyculin A stimulates the phosphorylation of PKB rather than inhibiting its dephosphorylation and that a phosphatase other than PP2A is activated by osmotic stress, which is inhibited by Calyculin A and not by okadaic acid. Because stimulation of PI 3-kinase by osmotic stress did not increase PKB activity, apparently because of the concomitant activation of an inhibitory pathway, the question remained as to whether other PI 3-kinase-driven signaling pathways could be triggered. p70 S6 kinase activation, which is PI 3-kinase dependent, was activated ∼20-fold when Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were stimulated with IGF-1, whereas osmotic shock caused a ∼6-fold stimulation of p70 S6 kinase. Both responses were completely rapamycin- and wortmannin-sensitive, whereas the p38/SAPK2 inhibitor SB20350 had no effect. Several possible mechanisms can account for the less pronounced p70 S6 kinase activation by osmotic stress compared with IGF-1. Because the activation of PKB is prevented under hyperosmotic conditions, this may result in impaired p70 S6 kinase activation. Although no direct phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase by PKB has been demonstrated, overexpression of constitutively active forms of PKB have been shown to activate p70S6 kinase (31Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 34Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Alternatively a direct, simultaneous deactivation of p70 S6 kinase by PP2A may occur. For example, Petersonet al. (35Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) showed that PP2A interacts with p70 S6 kinase and deactivates the enzyme by dephosphorylation. N- and C-terminally truncated p70 S6 kinase could still be phosphorylated and activated but showed reduced interaction with PP2A and was rapamycin-resistant. Another striking effect of osmotic stress was to induce a large increase in the level of PtdIns3P (Table I) in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (not shown). In many studies, the level of PtdIns(3)P in cells has shown to be unresponsive to growth factors. In Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with calcium ionophore (A23187), PtdIns3P showed a very slight increase (36Joyal J.L. Burks D.J. Pons S. Matter W.F. Vlahos C.J. White M.F. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28183-28186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and in platelets, activation of αIIbβ3 integrin leads to a small transient increase in PtdIns3P via a type II PI 3-kinase (4Banfic H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In platelets this increase in PtdIns3P precedes and appears to be required for subsequent synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P2. The recently described FYVE domain of early endosomal protein 1A, which specifically binds PtdIns3P, suggests that this lipid also has a direct signaling potential. Osmotic stress provides a means to manipulate PtdIns3P levels and thus to study the cellular functions of this lipid signal. This report shows that different cellular stresses activate distinct lipid signaling pathways that result in different cellular outputs. Oxidative stress resulted in a sustained increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels that was responsible for the activation of PKB but not of p70 S6 kinase. Osmotic stress caused substantial accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 because of the activation of a type I PI 3-kinase, resulting in p70 S6 kinase activation. Full activation of PKB was prevented, however, via the simultaneous activation of an inhibitory pathway that either prevents phosphorylation or promotes the dephosphorylation of PKB."

Recently, we demonstrated that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity is necessary for the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (Engelman, J. A., Lisanti, M. P., and Scherer, P. E. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32111–32120). p38 activity is high during the initial stages of differentiation but decreases drastically as the fibroblasts undergo terminal differentiation into adipocytes. However, it remains unknown whether activation of p38 is sufficient to stimulate adipogenesis and whether the down-regulation of p38 activity in mature adipocytes is critical for maintaining adipocyte homeostasis. In this report, we have directly addressed these questions by analyzing 3T3-L1 cell lines harboring a specific upstream activator of p38 (a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) mutant, MKK6(Glu)) under the control of an inducible promoter. Induction of MKK6(Glu) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts spurs adipocyte conversion in the absence of the hormonal mixture normally required for efficient differentiation of wild-type cells. However, activation of p38 in adipocytes leads to cell death. Furthermore, treatment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with salicylate, a potent stimulator of p38, produces adipocyte-specific changes consistent with those observed with induction of MKK6(Glu). Expression of MKK6(Glu) in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (cells that do not differentiate into adipocytes under normal conditions) is capable of converting these fibroblasts into lipid-laden fat cells following hormonal stimulation. Thus, p38 activation has pro-adipogenic effects in multiple fibroblast cell lines.

Other cell types, e.g. the 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442 cell lines, are more committed toward the adipocyte lineage, and hormonal stimulation alone can trigger adipogenic differentiation in these cells (5Green H.

The sequence of events leading to adipocyte conversion, marked by the accumulation of triglycerides and the induction of adipocyte-specific markers, includes the transient activation of members of both the C/EBP and PPAR families of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 8Darlington G.J. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30057-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are induced early in the differentiation process by IBMX and dexamethasone, respectively (9Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). At later stages of differentiation, C/EBPα and PPARγ are expressed and directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of many adipose-specific mRNAs. Recently, we identified C/EBPβ as a substrate for p38 MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase leads to a complete block of adipogenesis in these cells. Although p38 is present throughout adipocyte differentiation, p38 kinase activity and phosphorylation are observed only during the earliest phases of differentiation. Accordingly, treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with p38 inhibitors only during the early stages of differentiation is sufficient to block adipogenesis (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Inhibition of p38 during later stages of differentiation has no effect. p38 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily (11Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). MAP kinases participate in critical signaling cascades in many cell types. They are activated by extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, mitogens, cytokines and various forms of environmental stress. To date, three MAP kinase modules have been identified in mammalian cells: 1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (also referred to as p42/44 MAP kinase), 2) c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs; also termed stress-activated protein kinases), and 3) p38 MAP kinases. Our initial observations that p38 activity is necessary for adipogenesis prompted an important question. Is p38 activation sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation? To address this question, we generated a number of cell lines harboring an inducible, constitutively active MKK6, a potent p38 upstream activator. MKK6 (12Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L.

Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar) are both specific activators of p38 in vivo. In addition, MKK4, which activates JNK, may also phosphorylate and activate p38 (14Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 15Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H. Claret F.X. Lange-Carter C. Mercurio F. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These upstream activators behave as dual specificity protein kinases that threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylate p38 kinases at a specific site bearing the consensus Thr-Gly-Tyr. The activation sites for p42/44 (Thr-Glu-Tyr) and JNK (Thr-Pro-Tyr) are different and are not recognized by MKK3/6. Both MKK3 and MKK6 are themselves activated by dual phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. In the case of MKK6, these phosphorylation events take place on Ser207 and Thr211. Activation of MKK6 by these phosphorylation events may be mediated by the increased negative charge at these sites. Raingeaud et al. (13Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

This constitutively active mutant of MKK6 has been widely used to specifically activate p38 in vivo (13Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Two days later (day 2), the medium was switched to “DM2” (“FCS” containing 160 nminsulin). After another 2 days, the cells were switched backed to “FCS.” NIH-3T3 cells were grown and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% donor calf serum and antibiotics. The antibodies to fatty acyl CoA-synthase (FACS) and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) were generous gifts from Drs. Jean Schaffer and Perry Bickel (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Antibodies to the following proteins were purchased from the indicated sources: p38, phospho-p38, p42/44, phospho-p42/44, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-MKK4/SEK1, MKP-1, phospho-MKK3/6 from New England Biolabs; phospho-ATF-2, MKK3, ERK1/2, C/EBPβ from Santa Cruz; phospho-MKK4/SEK1 from Calbiochem; caveolin-1 from Transduction Laboratories.

Chem. 1982; 257: 12224-12230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Apoptosis assays were performed with a Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tag was introduced into human MKK6(Glu) to distinguish between endogenous and dominant active MKK6. The resulting fragment was cloned into vector pOPI3 (Stratagene) as a NotI fragment. The MKK6(Glu) insert was sequenced on both strands to confirm the mutations. This plasmid was co-transfected into 3T3-L1 or NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with plasmid pCMVLacI (Stratagene), and stable transformants were isolated in the presence of hygromycin. To determine activation states of various proteins of the p38, JunK, and p42/44 MAP kinase pathways during different stages of adipogenesis, lysates of 3T3-L1 cells at 2-day intervals of differentiation were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in boiling 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled again for another 3–5 min. Samples were then mildly sonicated to reduce viscosity. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to BA83 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS or Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (NEN Life Science Products). Luciferase assays were performed essentially as described previously (22Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A. Jo H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, 300,000 cells were seeded in six-well plates 12–24 h before transfection. Each point was transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of experimental plasmid. Twelve hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for another 24–36 h in propagation media. Cells were then subjected to lysis in 200 μl of extraction buffer, 50 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity, as described (23Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A.N. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each experimental value represented graphically is the value of independent transfections performed in parallel. The reporter construct (the generous gift of Dr. Nancy Colburn (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)) is a luciferase gene driven by the IL-6 promoter. C/EBPβ was initially termed NF-IL-6 because it is a transcription factor that directly activates the promoter of the IL-6 gene (24Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y.

Cell. 1990; 63: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts used for luciferase assays were grown under standard conditions with 10% FCS. Separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (26Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA sequencing facility at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Previously, we reported that p38 is highly active during the initial stages of 3T3-L1 differentiation, but subsequently decreases dramatically during terminal differentiation (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether the activation profile of p38 mirrors that of its upstream activating kinases, MKK3/6, or whether it is controlled by another mechanism in 3T3-L1 cells. To determine the activation state of these proteins, we used phosphospecific antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated, activated forms of MKK3/6 (Fig. 1, panel A). The MKK3/6 activity paralleled that found for p38, consistent with the role of MKK3/6 as upstream activators. Since p38 is present in the mature adipocyte, overexpression of MKK6(Glu), a constitutively active MKK6 mutant, is likely to increase p38 activity even at later stages of differentiation. Other components of the p38 MAP kinase (panel A), p42/44 MAP kinase cascade (panel B), and the JNK cascade (panel C) were analyzed as well. All the kinases were present throughout differentiation, but were markedly less active (>10-fold difference) in mature adipocytes. For controls, the blots were also probed with antibodies against an isoform of the GDI, a protein whose expression is relatively constant over the course of differentiation (27Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonté D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and ACRP30, an adipocyte-specific secretory protein whose expression is strongly induced during adipogenesis (20Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26746-26749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar) (panel A). To examine the consequences of activating p38 MAP kinase in fibroblasts and adipocytes, we generated a number of 3T3-L1 cell lines that stably express FLAG-tagged MKK6(Glu) under the control of the lac operon (LacSwitch™ II System, Stratagene). This system allows relatively tight repression in the absence of the inducer (IPTG). Several independent clones were analyzed. Experiments with a representative clone are shown. IPTG induced the expression of the FLAG-tagged MKK6(Glu) as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A). As expected, induction of MKK6(Glu) led to increased levels of phospho-p38 in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes (Fig. 2 B). In accordance with previously published observations, expression of dominant active MKK6 did not cause activation of p42/44 or JNK at either stage of differentiation (data not shown). To independently confirm that MKK6(Glu) increases p38 activity in these cells, we examined whether expression of the MKK6 mutant induced expression of a C/EBPβ-responsive reporter construct in subconfluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. We have previously shown that p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 cells. As predicted, the C/EBPβ-responsive reporter was significantly up-regulated in subconfluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (expressing C/EBPβ) in the presence of MKK6(Glu) (Fig. 2 C). This activation was blocked by treatment with the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (19Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), demonstrating that MKK6(Glu) activated the C/EBPβ-responsive promoter in a p38-dependent manner. SB203580 did not have a significant effect on luciferase activity in absence of MKK6(Glu). Several clonal 3T3-L1 cell lines expressing MKK6(Glu) under the control of the lac promotor were subjected to the standard differentiation protocol for adipogenesis, either in the absence or in the presence of the inducer, IPTG. Morphologically, the IPTG-treated cells started to accumulate lipid droplets more rapidly than cells not exposed to IPTG or IPTG-treated control cell lines. However, during the terminal stages of differentiation, many of the lipid-laden cells expressing MKK6(Glu) detached from the plate and died, leaving behind only undifferentiated fibroblasts. This phenomenon was observed in a number of independent clonal isolates. To obtain an independent assessment of these events, lysates were prepared from cells at various stages of differentiation. These lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an antibody to FACS, a protein whose expression correlates very well with adipocyte differentiation and the accumulation of lipid (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 32Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In parallel, extracts were also analyzed for the presence of caveolin-1, another protein that is dramatically induced during adipocyte differentiation (26Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, induction of MKK6(Glu) resulted in a more rapid induction of FACS and caveolin-1 (compare top and bottom panels). Interestingly, FACS and caveolin-1 expression decreased dramatically between day 6 and day 8, demonstrating the selective cell death of adipocytes as judged by the loss of adipocyte-specific markers. During the same period, a marker expressed equally in both fibroblasts and adipocytes (GDI) is not decreased. The overall protein concentration does not change because the void created by the detached adipocytes is filled by the proliferation of underlying fibroblasts. To confirm that there was indeed a large number of adipocytes undergoing cell death, cells were either differentiated in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 3 B, top panels), or in presence of IPTG throughout differentiation (center panels). Cells in the bottom panelswere also exposed to IPTG. However, after the 4th day of differentiation, SB203580 was added to inactivate p38 MAP kinase. We have previously shown that p38 activity is only required during the initial phase of differentiation and its inhibition does not significantly impact differentiation if inactivation occurs after day 4 (10Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All cells were analyzed after 8 days of differentiation and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-derived annexin V and propidium iodide. In this assay, annexin V binds to both apoptotic and necrotic cells, whereas propidium iodide stains late apoptotic/necrotic cells (33Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4518) Google Scholar, 34Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H.

Blood. 1995; 85: 532-540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the presence of IPTG throughout differentiation led to a large number of cells undergoing cell death (comparetop and center panels). Both apoptotic and necrotic cells were abundant among cells expressing MKK6(Glu). As the analysis was performed on the 8th day of differentiation, it is likely many cells had undergone apoptosis at earlier stages and the staining pattern observed on day 8 represents mostly late apoptotic/necrotic cells. Importantly, cell death could be prevented almost entirely by inactivation of p38 after the 4th day of differentiation (bottom panel), demonstrating that cell death was indeed triggered by p38 activation. These observations corroborate the morphological observations; induction of MKK6(Glu) results in a more rapid onset of adipogenesis, but also promotes cell death in the mature adipocyte. The previous experiment suggested that activation of p38 may promote adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, as judged by the earlier accumulation of adipocyte-specific markers. We observed that one of the effects of treating cells with the conventional differentiation mixture (“DM1”) was an increase in p38 activity (∼5-fold) (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that DM1 may stimulate adipogenesis (at least in part) by increasing p38 activity. To test whether MKK6(Glu)-induced p38 activation can bypass the normal hormonal requirements for 3T3-L1 adipogenesis (that include exogenous addition of insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), we maintained several of the stable cell lines harboring inducible MKK6(Glu) in standard propagation medium containing only 10% fetal calf serum. Once confluent, cells remained in propagation medium with the addition of IPTG. Fig. 4 B shows that MKK6(Glu) induction leads to the expression of adipocyte-specific markers (such as Acrp30, FACS, and caveolin-1) within 96 h of IPTG treatment, while control cells that did not get exposed to IPTG do not express these adipocyte-specific proteins. Equal loading in all lanes was confirmed by blotting with anti-GDI antibodies. It should be noted that Acrp30 is exclusively expressed in adipose tissue and is strongly induced during adipogenesis (26Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Corley-Mastick C.

Morphological analysis of these MKK6(Glu)-inducible cells revealed similar results. Within 20 h of MKK6 induction, occasional cells started to accumulate lipid droplets (Fig. 4 C). After 96 h of MKK6(Glu) induction, widespread lipid accumulation was observed (Fig. 4 D). In sharp contrast to the IPTG-treated cells, the untreated cells (or wild-type control cells lacking the dominant active MKK6 exposed to IPTG; data not shown) displayed only the sporadic occurrence of lipid-laden cells (less than 1 in 1000) that is normally observed upon prolonged incubation of wild-type cells at confluence. The micrograph of the untreated cells includes one of these spontaneously differentiating cells. The pro-adipogenic effect of MKK6(Glu) could be fully blocked by inclusion of SB203580, confirming that MKK6 exerts its effect through activation of p38. These findings were observed in multiple independent clonal isolates. Thus, p38 activation is not only necessary, but also sufficient to stimulate 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation in the absence of hormonal stimulation. Schwenger and colleagues (39Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have previously shown that treatment of FS-4 fibroblasts with sodium salicylate leads to activation of p38 MAP kinase. Therefore, we tested whether treatment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with salicylate resulted in similar effects as those observed with MKK6(Glu) induction. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were allowed to reach confluence and were treated with 5 mm sodium salicylate for 15 min (Fig. 5 A, acute) or for 4 days (Fig. 5 A, chronic). Extracts were prepared, and the activation state of the various MAP kinases was determined. Fig. 5 A shows that acute exposure to salicylate activated p38 (∼3.5-fold) and p42/44 (∼2-fold) MAP kinases, but not Jun kinase."

These receptors, which include two isoforms, the FPA and FPB, have been cloned from a number of species and are members of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Previous studies have shown that the activation of FP receptors leads to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, intracellular calcium release, and activation of protein kinase C. Here, we demonstrate that PGF2α treatment of 293-EBNA (Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen) cells that have been stably transfected with either the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms leads to changes in cell morphology and in the cell cytoskeleton. Specifically, cells treated with PGF2α show retraction of filopodia and become rounded, and actin stress fibers are formed. Pretreatment of the cells with bisindolylmaleimide I, a protein kinase C inhibitor, has no effect on the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology, although it does block the effects of phorbol myristate acetate on cell morphology. On the other hand, the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology and formation of actin stress fibers can be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with C3 exoenzyme, a specific inhibitor of the small G-protein, Rho. Consistent with FP receptor induced formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, FPA receptor activation also leads to rapid (within two minutes) tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) which can be blocked by pretreating the cells with C3 exoenzyme.

This truncated isoform, which arises by alternative mRNA splicing, lacks 46 amino acids present in the original isoform, now called the FPA receptor isoform.

Although the FP prostanoid receptor isoforms couple to activation of Gq, there is evidence that these isoforms may exert some of their physiological effects by activation of additional effectors. Strikingly, in isolated rat cardiomyocytes, the PGF2α-induced hypertrophy and atrial natriuretic factor expression is independent of PKC activation (5Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This is surprising because PKC inhibitors do block the hypertrophic responses induced by other drugs, including phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phenylephrine (5Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The insensitivity of the PGF2α-induced cardiac hypertrophy to PKC inhibitors suggests that PGF2αmay activate additional signal transduction pathways that are distinct from the known activation of Gq. Furthermore, activation of these pathways may be important in regulating some of the physiological actions of PGF2α, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. To gain further understanding into the diversity of the signal transduction pathways activated by the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms, 293-EBNA cells that stably express each of these isoforms were generated, and the downstream signaling was examined. We now report that PGF2α treatment of cells expressing either isoform leads to changes in cell morphology and in the cytoskeleton. These changes, which include retraction of filopodia, cell rounding, and the formation of actin stress fibers, are sensitive to the inhibition of the small G-protein Rho but not to the inhibition of PKC. These data suggest that the both the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms are coupled to at least two independent second messenger pathways, one involving phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and intracellular calcium release and the other involving activation of Rho. Stable transfectants of the FPA and FPB isoforms were generated in 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells that have been stably transfected with the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). The presence of EBNA allows high copy episomal replication of plasmids, such as pCEP4 (Invitrogen) that contain an Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication. These cells were grown according to the manufacturer's instructions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies), and 200 μg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies). For the stable transfection, the cDNA encoding the FPA receptor (10Graves P.E. Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Rueda B.R. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Yool A.J. Hoyer P.B. Regan J.W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was subcloned into theXhoI/NotI sites of pCEP4 to form the plasmids pCEP4/FPA and pCEP4/FPB. Twenty μg of purified plasmid DNA was transfected into one 10-cm plate of 293-EBNA cells using the calcium phosphate method with glycerol shock. Since the plasmid pCEP4 encodes the gene for hygromycin B resistance, 2 days after the transfection cells were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies). Approximately 10 days after transfection, hygromycin B-resistant clones were individually selected, and each clone was transferred to 1 well of a 24-well plate. Once the cells had reached confluence in the 24-well plate, they were transferred to 1 well of a 6-well plate and further expanded to 10-cm dishes. Clones expressing the FP receptor isoforms were identified and selected based on both inositol phosphate assays and radioligand binding. For use in the biochemical assays, the cells were maintained under continuous hygromycin B selection and split as necessary. For the phase contrast microscopy, 293-EBNA cells stably expressing the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms were plated in 12-well tissue culture dishes (Falcon) under subconfluent conditions (∼25,000 cells/well). The cells were grown for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 200 μg/ml gentamicin without any changes of the media. For the imaging, cells were visualized under phase contrast microscopy using an Olympus CK2 microscope. Images were obtained using a Cohu high performance CCD camera and processed using IP Spectrum software (Signal Analytics). Cells were grown for 2 days on 22-mm round glass coverslips (VWR Scientific) in 6-well dishes under subconfluent conditions. After the appropriate drug treatments, they were fixed for 15 min in freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, quenched 3 times for 10 min in 0.1m glycine, pH 7.4, and permeabilized for 15 min in 2× SSC (30 mm NaCl, 300 mm sodium citrate) containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad). Cells were preincubated in blocking buffer (2× SSC, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% sodium azide) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with 0.1 unit of Texas red isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in 50 μl of blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were briefly washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and mounted using p-phenylenediamine. The cells were viewed by immunofluorescence microscopy with an Olympus BH-2 microscope with a 60× oil objective through a Texas red isothiocyanate filter cube. Cells were plated in 6-well plates (Falcon) at low density and allowed to grow to confluence for 2 days. Cells were treated with PGF2α(Cayman Chemicals) and washed once with room temperature 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 50 mm NaF, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The cell lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and the insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C, 12,000 rpm). Protein contents were normalized, and the maximum amount of protein was used in a 300-μl volume. For the immunoprecipitation, 3 μl (1:100 dilution, 0.2 mg/ml stock) of rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the lysates were rotated overnight at 4 °C. Ten μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-agarose (Sigma) were added, and the lysates were rotated for an additional hour at 4 °C. Next, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and once with the above buffer without added Nonidet P-40. Five μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled and electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5 ml of 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) (TBS-T) and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The blots were then incubated in this buffer with a 1:1,000 dilution of a monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine-specific antibody (PY-20, Transduction Labs) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. The blots were washed several times in TBS-T and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) in TBS-T plus 3% bovine serum albumin. After several washes in TBS-T, the immunoreactivity was detected using SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). To ensure equal loading of proteins, the blots were stripped and reprobed as before with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-FAK antibody (C-20, SantaCruz Biotechnology) and a 1:10,000 dilution of a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Escherichia colitransformed with a plasmid encoding a glutathioneS-transferase/C3 exoenzyme fusion protein was used for the purification of the C3 exoenzyme according to Dillon and Feig (12Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fusion protein purification was performed using glutathione (GSH)-conjugated-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and thrombin (Haematological Technologies) was added to cleave the C3 exoenzyme from the glutathione S-transferase that remained bound to the GSH-Sepharose beads. The C3 exoenzyme that was released into the supernatant was concentrated to a final concentration of approximately 4 μg/μl using a Centricon 10 (Amicon). The purity of the C3 exoenzyme was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. To examine the signal transduction pathways activated by the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms, the receptor isoforms were stably expressed in 293-EBNA cells. The FPAand FPB cell lines each express approximately 2 pmol of receptor/mg of total protein as assessed by radioligand binding using [3H]PGF2α (data not shown). We and others have previously demonstrated that the FP prostanoid receptor isoforms are coupled to the G-protein, Gq (7Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and as expected, PGF2α activation of the stably expressed FPAreceptor and FPB isoforms led to an increase in inositol phosphate accumulation (EC50 = 19 nm for the FPA and 11 nm for the FPB) and intracellular calcium release (data not shown). Surprisingly, in addition to coupling to stimulation of intracellular calcium release and inositol phosphate production, we found that in cells that stably expressed either the FPA or FPB receptor isoform, PGF2α treatment led to retraction of filopodia, cell rounding, and a cobblestone appearance of the cells. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1. For these experiments, cells stably expressing the FPA receptor isoform (panels Aand B), the FPB receptor isoform (panels C and D), or untransfected 293-EBNA cells (panels E and F) were plated at low density (∼25,000 cells/well of a 12-well dish), grown for 2 to 3 days, and then unstimulated (panels A, C, and E) or stimulated with 1 μm PGF2α (panels B, D, and F) overnight at 37 °C. As shown in panels B and D, PGF2α treatment affected the morphology of the cells expressing the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms but had no effect on untransfected cells (panel F). In subsequent experiments, the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology were apparent within 15 min after exposure to 1 μm PGF2αand were maximal within 2 h after treatment (data not shown). To gain understanding into the mechanisms underlying the FP prostanoid receptor isoform-mediated changes in cell morphology, we examined whether known effectors of FP receptor activation were involved. The possibility of PKC involvement was suggested when it was observed that PMA also led to changes in cell morphology (Fig. 2 B, panel a). To determine whether both the PMA and PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology were dependent upon activation of PKC we examined the ability of bisindolylmaleimide I (also known as GF109203X; Calbiochem) to inhibit the PGF2α- and PMA-induced changes in cell morphology. As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A with cells expressing the FPA receptor isoform (panels aand b) or the FPB receptor isoform (panels c and d), treatment of the cells with 2.5 μm bisindolylmaleimide I alone had no effect on cell morphology (panels a and c). In addition, pretreating the cells for 15 min with 2.5 μmbisindolylmaleimide had no effect on the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology in cells expressing either isoform (panels b and d). However, as shown in Fig. 2 B, the PMA-induced changes in cell morphology could be prevented by pretreating the cells with bisindolylmaleimide I (panel b). In addition to the role for PKC, we also determined whether increases in intracellular calcium were involved in the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology. However, doses of up to 2.5 μm BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator, had no effect on the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology (data not shown). One of the intracellular signaling pathways that has been shown to be involved in G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated changes in cell morphology is the activation of the small G-protein Rho (13Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanorelle P. Brown J.H. J.

Science. 1998; 279: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme, a bacterial toxin that ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho, was used to test the potential involvement of Rho in the FPA- and FPB-mediated changes in cell morphology. As shown in Fig. 3 A for cells expressing the FPA isoform and in Fig. 3 B for cells expressing the FPB isoform, cells were either untreated (panels a and b) or pretreated with 40 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme for 48 h (panels c and d). The cells were then either unstimulated (panels a and c) or stimulated with 100 nm PGF2α for 1 h (panels b and d). Pretreatment of the cells with C3 exoenzyme almost completely inhibited the PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology, suggesting the involvement of Rho in the FPA- and FPBreceptor-mediated changes in cell morphology. In many systems, activation of Rho leads to the formation of actin stress fibers (16Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 17Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3832) Google Scholar). Since our data suggested that the FPA- and FPB-mediated changes in cell morphology were Rho-dependent, we examined the possibility that activation of either isoform would also promote the formation of Rho-mediated actin stress fibers. As shown in Fig. 4 A for cells expressing the FPA receptor isoform and in Fig. 4 B for cells expressing the FPB receptor isoform, cells were either untreated (panels a and b) or pretreated with 40 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme for 48 h (panels c andd). The cells were then either unstimulated (panels a and c) or stimulated with 100 nmPGF2α for 1 h (panels b andd). Cells were then fixed, phalloidin-stained, and imaged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in panel b, PGF2α treatment of cells stably expressing the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms led to the formation of actin stress fibers that were not present in untreated cells (panel a). Pretreatment of the cells with C3 exoenzyme abrogated the PGF2α-induced formation of actin stress fibers (panel d), suggesting that Rho is essential for the FP receptor-mediated formation of actin stress fibers in these cells. One of the pathways that has previously been shown to be activated by PGF2α is the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (5Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe T. Nakao A. Emerling D. Hashimoto Y. Tsukamoto K. Horie Y. Kinoshita M. Kurokawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17619-17625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In several systems, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK has been shown to be blocked by C3 exoenzyme, suggesting that it is downstream of Rho activation (19Bétuing S. Daviaud D. Pagès C. Bonnard E. Valet P. Lafontan M. Saulnier-Blache J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15804-15810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we wanted to determine if activation of FP receptors would lead C3 exoenzyme-sensitive phosphorylation of p125 FAK. As shown in Fig. 5, FPA-expressing cells were either untreated (panel A) or pretreated with 40 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme for 48 h (panel B). The cells were then either unstimulated or stimulated with 1 μmPGF2α for the times indicated. The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for p125 FAK (C-20, Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (PY-20, Transduction Labs) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 A shows that in cells that were not pretreated with C3 exoenzyme, there was an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK that was apparent 2 min after stimulation with PGF2α, maximal within 15 min, and sustained for at least 60 min after PGF2αtreatment. Nearly identical results were obtained with the FPB-expressing cells (data not shown). Fig. 5 Bshows that in FPA-expressing cells that were pretreated with C3 exoenzyme, the time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK was greatly diminished, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK is downstream of Rho activation. Here we have demonstrated that activation of the cloned ovine FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms stably expressed in 293-EBNA cells leads to Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology, formation of actin stress fibers, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK. Although the FP receptor is known to be coupled to stimulation of intracellular calcium release and protein kinase C activation via the G-protein Gq, the Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology appear to be independent of either of these two effectors. This suggests that both the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms can couple to at least two distinct pathways, one involving Gq and the other involving Rho. There are several examples of other G-protein-coupled receptors that are able to couple to a classical G-protein-coupled pathway (Gq or Gi) and to a separate Rho-dependent pathway. For instance, the thrombin receptor, like the FPA prostanoid receptor isoform, is a Gq-coupled receptor that stimulates changes in cell morphology that are independent of PKC activation and intracellular calcium release and are pertussis toxin-insensitive (14Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanorelle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Like the FPA receptor isoform, the changes in cell morphology induced by thrombin are sensitive to C3 exoenzyme, demonstrating that the changes in cell morphology are Rho-dependent (14Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Goldstein D. de Lanorelle P. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10099-10106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among the prostanoid receptors, activation of the Gi-coupled EP3 prostanoid receptor expressed in PC-12 cells led to the Rho-dependent retraction of nerve growth factor-stimulated neurite outgrowth (13Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like the FPA receptor and thrombin-induced changes in cell morphology, the EP3-mediated changes were insensitive to PKC inhibitors and intracellular calcium chelators but were sensitive to C3 exoenzyme (13Katoh H. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29780-29784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, differences have been found between two EP3 receptor isoforms in their ability to activate Rho (21Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Like the FP receptor isoforms, the EP3receptor isoforms differ only in their carboxyl termini. It was recently reported that in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expression of the EP3α isoform led to the constitutive formation of actin stress fibers, whereas in cells expressing the EP3βisoform, stress fibers were formed in an agonist-dependent manner (21Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 234: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The data with the EP3 receptor isoforms suggest that there are regions in the carboxyl termini that may be important in modulating the interaction with the effectors involved in stress fiber formation. With the FP receptor isoforms, however, it does not appear that the longer FPA carboxyl terminus has a role in mediating the effects of PGF2α on shape change, stress fiber formation, and p125 FAK phosphorylation. Most likely, the regions of the FPA receptor isoform that are not present in the FPB regulate receptor-effector interactions in other ways, such as regulating desensitization. Although we have demonstrated that Rho is involved in the FPA and FPB receptor-mediated changes in cell morphology, the pathway leading from the receptor to Rho remains unknown. However, one potential pathway involves the heterotrimeric G-proteins G12 and G13. Although the immediate effectors of these two G-proteins are not well characterized, previous studies have demonstrated that direct injection of constitutively active forms of either of these G-proteins into Swiss 3T3 cells induced the formation of actin stress fibers that was blocked by the injection of C3 exoenzyme (22Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). G13 has also been implicated in the Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers induced by lysophosphatidic acid in Swiss 3T3 cells (23Gohla A. Harhammer R. Schultz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4653-4659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Besides the formation of actin stress fibers, G12 and G13 have also been implicated in the Rho-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK (20Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Specifically, transient overexpression of constitutively active mutants of either G12 or G13 led to tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 FAK, which was blocked by co-transfection with a plasmid encoding C3 exoenzyme (20Needham L.K. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14626-14632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Since the present findings indicate that the FP receptor isoforms couple to the Rho-dependent formation of actin stress fibers, the heterotrimeric G-proteins G12 and G13 are likely effectors. Here we have demonstrated that both the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms are coupled to the activation of Rho. In addition to demonstrating for the first time that the FP receptor isoforms both couple to Rho-dependent pathways, these data suggest that other regions of the receptor besides the carboxyl termini are responsible for the interaction with the Rho-dependent effectors. The identification of Rho as an effector of the FP receptor isoforms will give clues to some of the physiological effects of PGF2α, such as the PGF2α-induced hypertrophy of rat-isolated cardiomyocytes (5Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the PGF2α-induced in vivo cardiac growth (3Lai J. Jin H. Yang R. Winer J. Li W. Yen R.

For example, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and protein phosphatase 1 are two major dendritic proteins that play key roles in hippocampal long-term potentiation and long-term depression, respectively (1Malenka R.C.

Both of these forms of synaptic plasticity display remarkable synapse-specificity; only synapses stimulated with an appropriate activity pattern undergo long-term potentiation or long-term depression, whereas other synapses in the same postsynaptic neuron remain unaffected. These observations imply that synaptic activity stimulated signal transduction molecules and events are restricted (or targeted) specifically to synapses. While mechanisms for synaptic targeting of neuronal protein kinases are being elucidated (2Klauck T.M. Scott J.D. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,3Strack S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), comparatively little is known about mechanisms for synaptic targeting of protein phosphatases. The monomeric catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)1 likely does not represent a significant fraction of the total enzyme in any tissue; diverse tissue-specific PP1-binding proteins (PP1bps) are thought to confer specific regulatory properties and subcellular localization to each cellular PP1 holoenzyme (reviewed in Ref. 4Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). For example, in skeletal muscle, GM-regulatory subunits target PP1 to glycogen particles and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phosphorylation of GM by protein kinase A dissociates PP1 and thereby inhibits the dephosphorylation of glycogen-associated substrates. Conversely, phosphorylation of GM by an insulin-sensitive protein kinase activates the associated PP1 and promotes dephosphorylation of substrate proteins associated with the glycogen particle (4Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). More than 10 proteins that bind the catalytic subunit of PP1 in non-neuronal tissues have been identified (5Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 55-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A conserved sequence motif V-X-F/W in PP1bps, often preceded by basic residues, makes important interactions with PP1 (6Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P. Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D.

However, there are undoubtedly additional contacts that play a role in the interaction and in modulating phosphatase activity (see “Discussion”). The four isoforms of PP1 (α, β, γ1, γ2) are expressed in neuronal tissues and exhibit distinct cellular distributions and subcellular localizations (9da Cruz e Silva E.F. Fox C.A. Ouimet C.C. Gustafson E. Watson S.J. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3375-3389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ouimet C.C. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For example, PP1γ1 is selectively enriched at synapses in cultured rat cortical neurons, whereas PP1β is enriched in the soma (11Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical staining of rat brain sections also indicates that PP1α and PP1γ1 are enriched in synaptic layers and dendritic spines (10Ouimet C.C. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3396-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas PP1β is relatively enriched in somatic layers (11Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although neuronal PP1 inhibitor proteins, such as DARPP-32, have been characterized in detail (reviewed in Ref. 12Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Girault J.A. Ouimet C.C. Snyder G.L. Fisone G. Allen P.B. Fienberg A. Nishi A. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), proteins responsible for selective targeting of PP1 isoforms have not been identified. We characterized four PP1bps with molecular masses of 75, 134, 175, and 216 kDa in whole rat forebrain extracts which were enriched in isolated postsynaptic densities (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PP1bp134 and PP1bp175 exhibited isoform selectivity, binding to the α, γ1, γ2 isoforms better than the β isoform in gel overlays (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent screening of brain cDNA libraries using yeast two-hybrid approaches with a PP1α probe identified two novel neuronal PP1bps, spinophilin, a dendritic spine-localized protein (14Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and PNUTS, a PP1bp found in the nucleus (15Allen P.B. Kwon Y.G. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4089-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, there is only limited information available about native spinophilin and PNUTS proteins, and their roles in isoform-selective targeting of PP1 has not been investigated. Here we report the purification and characterization of a novel neuronal PP1 holoenzyme containing PP1γ1 associated with PP1bp134 and PP1bp175, and identify the PP1bps as spinophilin (14Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar,17Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K.

Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The same protein was independently purified and cloned as an F-actin binding protein and named neurabin II (17Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) based on its homology to neurabin (16Nakanishi H. Obaishi H.

We elected to use spinophilin to name this protein in the present paper since it was the first published name. 2Spinophilin was initially identified by yeast two-hybrid screening of a rat brain cDNA library, and was named based on its immunohistochemical enrichment in dendritic spines (14Allen P.B.

Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), respectively, two homologous actin-binding proteins. We show that spinophilin and neurabin selectively interact with PP1γ1over PP1β, suggesting that they are at least in part responsible for the enrichment of PP1γ1 at synapses. Forebrains were rapidly dissected following euthanasia, quick-frozen in liquid N2, and then stored at −80 °C until needed. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Forebrains were partially thawed in 10 ml per forebrain of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 40 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/liter leupeptin) plus 150 mm KCl and then homogenized using a Polytron followed by 15 passes in a motorized Teflon/glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 25 min, the supernatant (S1) was discarded. The pellet (P1) was re-homogenized in 10 ml/forebrain of Buffer B (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin) and then dialyzed for 2 h against Buffer B. Similar low ionic strength conditions have been shown previously to destabilize the F-actin cytoskeleton, solubilizing actin-binding proteins (23Levilliers N. Peron-Renner M. Coffe G. Pudles J. Biochimie (Paris). 1984; 66: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant (S2) was saved and the pellet (P3) was re-homogenized in 10 ml/forebrain of Buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100. After mixing gently for 1 h followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant (S3) was removed and the pellet (P3) was resuspended in Buffer B. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Combined S2/S3 extracts from 10–20 rat forebrains (see above) were applied to a Fast-Flow Q-Sepharose ion exchange column (100 ml) equilibrated in Buffer C (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mg/liter leupeptin). The column was sequentially washed with 250 ml of Buffer C and then with 250 ml (each) of Buffer C adjusted to 0.25, 0.40, and 0.5 m NaCl, collecting 20-ml fractions. PP1bps were most abundant in the 0.4m NaCl eluate, coeluting with PP1 activity and immunoreactivity, and were precipitated from pooled Q-Sepharose fractions by slowly adding ammonium sulfate (313 g/liter). After stirring for 30 min, precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was redissolved in ×0.1 the original volume of Buffer B and 2-ml aliquots were size-fractionated on a FPLC Superdex 200 column (100 ml) equilibrated in Buffer C, collecting 2 ml fractions at 1 ml/min. PP1 activity and immunoreactivity eluted from Superdex 200 in two peaks (400–600 kDa, ≈100 kDa), and PP1bps were mostly associated with the larger PP1 species (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 400–600-kDa pools from 2 or 3 Superdex 200 columns were applied directly to a 1-ml FPLC Mono Q (0.5 ml/min) or a 8-ml Source Q (4 ml/min) ion exchange column equilibrated in Buffer C; the columns were eluted with a NaCl gradient, collecting 1- or 8-ml fractions, respectively. PP1bp134, PP1bp175, and PP1 co-eluted with a peak of PP1 activity at 0.3–0.4m NaCl (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Peak fractions were pooled and mixed overnight with microcystin-Sepharose (0.5 ml) (generous gift of Dr. C. Macintosh, Dundee) equilibrated in Buffer C. After washing with 0.5 mNaCl in Buffer C (10 ml), bound proteins were eluted with 3m NaSCN, collecting 0.5-ml fractions. Fractions containing PP1bp134, PP1bp175, and PP1 were pooled, concentrated in Centricon 30 devices, and then dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were analyzed for PP1bps by DIG-PP1 overlay assay, and for the presence of protein phosphatase catalytic subunits by immunoblotting, as described (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with either 2.5–10 nm digoxigenin-conjugated PP1γ1 or with antibodies specific to the indicated proteins (see below). Blots were developed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and colorimetric reagents. Protein phosphatase activities were measured essentially as described (18Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). During purification from brain extracts, PP1 activity is defined as glycogen phosphorylasea phosphatase activity measured in the presence of 2.5 nm okadaic acid. Similar definitions were used previously to define PP1 activity in brain extracts (18Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 28Sim A.T. Ratcliffe E. Mumby M.C. Villa-Moruzzi E. Rostas J.A. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although 2.5 nm okadaic acid is generally considered to block >90% of PP2A-like activities, certain forms of PP2A may have reduced sensitivity to okadaic acid (22Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, poorly defined PP2A-like species may contribute to our operationally defined PP1 activity, particularly at earlier stages of the purification. The activity of recombinant PP1γ1 (bacterially expressed; generous gift of Dr. E. Y. Lee) was determined in the absence of okadaic acid and in the presence of 0.2 mm MnCl2. About 80 μg of purified PP1A holoenzyme was solubilized in SDS and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (mini-gels 0.75-mm thick, 3-cm wide lane; 7.5% acrylamide). The gel was electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore) for 3 h at 1 A (4 °C) in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, containing 10% (v/v) methanol. Two widely separated vertical strips (2 mm each) were excised from the lane and analyzed by DIG-PP1 overlay to identify PP1bps, and the remaining membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue. The stained band corresponding to PP1bp134 (estimated 5–10 μg of protein) was excised, washed thoroughly in water, reduced, and alkylated before being incubated with 0.2 μg endo-Lys-C (15 h at 37 °C). Solubilized proteolytic fragments of PP1bp134 were fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (C18 column) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid buffer. Three discretely resolved peptide peaks (detected by absorbance at 214 nm) were subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise 492 protein sequencer (PE Biosystems). Double stranded DNA fragments of spinophilin and neurabin were generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Promega Access) using rat brain total RNA. Oligonucleotide primer pairs (spinophilin: 5′-CATTTCAGCACCGCACCGATC and 5′-CCAGCGCCCTTTCTCCTGCTC; neurabin: 5′-GAGGGCTCCCAGCAGAGTAGG and 5′-CACTTCCGGTACTGGCACAGC; 5′-GTCCAAGGCCTGCAAGTTCGG and 5′-GCACACTCCACTCATGGACGG) were designed based on sequences available in the data bases (spinophilin, AF016252; neurabin, U72994). The polymerase chain reaction products served as templates for the synthesis of 32P-labeled DNA probes (Stratagene Prime-It II), which were used to screen a rat brain cDNA library in λZAPII by hybridization, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Hybridizing cDNA clones were plaque-purified, excised, and transferred to pBluescript II SK(+), and their identity confirmed by partial sequencing. Full-length cDNAs were assembled from partial clones using restriction sites. Full-length spinophilin and neurabin cDNAs, with or without an N-terminal Myc epitope tag (MEQKLISEEDL) (19Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), were subcloned into a pCMV4 eukaryotic expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter (generous gift of Drs. M. Wilson and L. E. Limbird, Vanderbilt University). Automated DNA sequencing (Vanderbilt Center for Molecular Neuroscience) confirmed the complete nucleotide sequences of these constructs. HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (13.6 μg of DNA/100-mm dish) essentially as described (20Lovinger D.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 164-172PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 mg/liter leupeptin; 1.25 ml/100-mm dish), probe-sonicated (2 × 20-s bursts), and then centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min) to generate soluble cell extracts. Extracts were either used immediately, or stored at −80 °C until required. Regions of cDNAs encoding the indicated residues of spinophilin and neurabin were either isolated by polymerase chain reaction using primers incorporating appropriate restriction sites, or obtained by digestion at naturally occurring restriction sites, and then inserted into pGEX-2T or -4T prokaryotic expression vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacteria (DH5α) harboring the expression vector were induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3–5 h and GST fusion proteins were isolated from soluble extracts using glutathione-agarose essentially according to the directions of the manufacturer. A GST-GM fusion protein containing residues 1–240 of the glycogen targeting subunit of PP1 (21Wu J. Liu J. Thompson I. Oliver C.J. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was generously provided by R. Terry and Dr. S. Shenolikar (Duke University). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard; in PP1 inhibition assays, concentrations refer to estimates of the full-length fusion protein by Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-PAGE. Rabbit antibodies raised against divergent sequences from the C termini of PP1 isoforms were described previously (11Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar antibodies were raised against the identical peptides in sheep. The rabbit and sheep antibodies exhibited similar isoform-specificity in immunoblotting experiments using either whole antiserum or affinity purified antibodies: antibodies raised to PP1β and PP1γ1 sequences were specific for the corresponding isoform, whereas the antibodies raised to a PP1α sequence recognized all PP1 isoforms and are designated pan-PP1 antibody (11Strack S. Kini S. Ebner F. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 413: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (data not shown). PP2A catalytic subunit antibodies were either from Transduction Laboratories (mouse monoclonal) or were raised against a PP2AC peptide sequence (PNVTRRTPDYFL) in sheep. Sheep PP2AC antibodies exhibited similar specificity to previously described rabbit antibodies against the same peptide (22Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Antibodies to the Myc epitope tag (purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation from mouse ascites fluid) were a generous gift from Drs. J. Flick and R. Wisdom (Vanderbilt University). Rabbit antisera were raised to GST fusion proteins containing divergent regions of either spinophilin (residues 286–390) or neurabin (residues 146–453). Rabbits were given an intranodal injection of 0.2 mg of fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed after 21 days by a 0.2-mg intranodal boost in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Animals were first boosted with 0.1 mg of fusion protein in incomplete adjuvant at subcutaneous and intramuscular sites 14 days after the initial injection, and subsequently at 20-day intervals. All the studies in this manuscript utilize whole antiserum from the first or second bleed, performed 10 days after booster injections. Rabbit injections and bleedings were performed by Upstate Biotechnology. Native brain protein phosphatase catalytic subunits were separated from their associated subunits and proteins as follows. Fresh rat forebrain S1 extract (180 ml) (see above) was quick-frozen and stored at −80 °C until used. The extract was slowly thawed and then 313 g/liter ammonium sulfate were slowly added and the extract was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 28,000 × g, and then resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer X (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mmPMSF, 20 mg/liter soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mg/liter leupeptin) containing 10% glycerol using a Polytron homogenizer. Room temperature ethanol (100 ml; 95%) containing 1 mm PMSF was added and the suspension was then immediately centrifuged for 5 min at 28,000 × g. The pellet was extracted with 2 × 20-ml aliquots of Buffer X by homogenization using a Polytron. Ammonium sulfate (430 g/liter) was added to the pooled solubilized proteins, and precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation (35,000 ×g for 20 min). The pellet was redissolved in 10 ml of Buffer X and then dialyzed overnight against Buffer X. After dialysis, the preparation was clarified at 35,000 × g for 20 min and then stored at −80 °C in aliquots. To estimate concentrations of PP1β and PP1γ1 in this preparation, aliquots were immunoblotted in parallel with known amounts of recombinant PP1 isoforms using isoform-specific antibodies. In two independent experiments, the concentrations were estimated at 1–1.5 μm and 0.5–0.75 μm for PP1β and PP1γ1, respectively (total protein concentration 2.96 mg/ml). Approximately 8 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of crude protein phosphatase catalytic subunit mixture (see above) in 14 ml of binding buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The final concentration of GST fusion protein was about 17 nm; PP1β and PP1γ1were present at 2–5 nm each, together with an unknown concentration of PP1α. About 20 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-agarose was added and the incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C. The resin was sedimented, washed with 4 × 5-ml aliquots of binding buffer, and then transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube. To concentrate protein phosphatases that did not associate with GST fusion proteins, supernatants from glutathione-agarose sedimentation were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of a 50:50 slurry of microcystin-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), and the resin was then sedimented. Proteins associated with glutathione-agarose and with microcystin-agarose were solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and aliquots were analyzed by immunoblotting. Combined S2/S3 rat forebrain extracts or HEK293 cell soluble extracts (see above) were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein in IP Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and 0.5-ml aliquots were precleared using 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose or GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The supernatant was mixed with 5 μl of the indicated rabbit or sheep antiserum (or preimmune serum) or mouse ascites fluid for 1 h at 4 °C. After addition of 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (rabbit or mouse antibodies) or GammaBind Plus Sepharose (sheep antibodies), respectively, incubations were continued overnight at 4 °C. Resin was collected by microcentrifugation, and then washed with at least 4 × 1 ml of IP Buffer; during the last wash resin was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Immune complexes were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Aliquots of immune complexes and immune supernatants, as well as an aliquot of the initial extract, were analyzed by immunoblotting. In order to identify previously characterized PP1bps (13Colbran R.J. Bass M.A. McNeill R.B. Bollen M. Zhao S. Wadzinski B.E. Strack S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we undertook their purification from rat forebrain extracts.

https://openalex.org/W2052831927,"Glycosylation of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids occurring in the Golgi apparatus requires the translocation of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi. Translocation is mediated by specific nucleotide sugar transporters, integral Golgi membrane proteins that regulate the above glycosylation reactions. A defect in GDP-fucose transport into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus has been recently identified in a patient affected by leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II syndrome (Lubke, T., Marquardt, T., von Figura, K., and Korner, C. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 25986–25989). We have now identified and purified the rat liver Golgi membrane GDP-fucose transporter, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa, by a combination of column chromatography, native functional size determination on a glycerol gradient, and photoaffinity labeling with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P] triphosphate, an analog of GDP-fucose. The purified transporter appears to exist as a homodimer within the Golgi membrane. When reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine liposomes, it was active in GDP-fucose transport and was specifically photolabeled with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate. Transport was also stimulated 2–3-fold after preloading proteoliposomes with GMP, the putative antiporter. Glycosylation of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids occurring in the Golgi apparatus requires the translocation of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi. Translocation is mediated by specific nucleotide sugar transporters, integral Golgi membrane proteins that regulate the above glycosylation reactions.

While glycosyltransferases are resident Golgi proteins, nucleotide sugars are mostly synthesized in the cytosol and need to be translocated into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus before they can serve as substrates in the above post-translational modifications (reviewed in Refs. 1Abeijon C.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Translocation is mediated by specific and well characterized nucleotide sugar transporters, integral Golgi membrane proteins that function as antiporters; they translocate the nucleotide-sugar to the inside of the Golgi apparatus while the corresponding nucleoside-monophosphate exits (reviewed in Refs. 1Abeijon C.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The latter is generated in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus through the action of a glycosyltransferase and a nucleoside diphosphatase (reviewed in Refs. 1Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B.

Considerable progress has been made in the past few years in the cloning of genes encoding some of these Golgi membrane transporters. Genes encoding the CMP-sialic acid (3Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M.

Also, genes encoding transporters for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (10Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5963-5968Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and UDP-galactose (11Tabuchi M. Tanaka N. Iwahara S. Takegawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were cloned from yeast. All of these genes were identified by complementation cloning in mutant cells. Analyses of the above mutants showed that nucleotide sugar transporters are of physiologic importance because cells deficient in these transport activities have a defect in the biosynthesis of the corresponding macromolecules (reviewed in Refs. 1Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 2Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because of their potential role in a broad variety of fundamental physiological events, a “knock out” mice model was expected to be lethal. Consequently, the hunt for transport deficiency diseases has been delayed until now. Recently, Lubke et al. (12Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have identified a defect in the translocation of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus in a patient with a clinical phenotype resembling that of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II (LAD II).1 LAD II belongs to a very broad group of hereditary disorders known as carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome and characterized by a general defect in glycosylation of glycoprotein and glycolipids (reviewed in Refs. 13Thomas G.H.

The clinical phenotype as well as the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders is very heterogeneous (reviewed in Refs. 13Thomas G.H. Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2529-2561Google Scholar and 14Anderson D.C. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3955-3994Google Scholar). Specifically, LAD II is characterized by recurrent nonpyrogenic infections, persistent leukocytosis, and severe mental and growth retardation. LAD II can be differentiated from LAD I because the former displays more common and evident psychomotor retardation and physical dysmorphisms. Furthermore, while LAD I patients carry mutations in the genes that encode members of the integrin family, LAD II patients are thought to have a general enzymatic defect in the pathway that synthesizes GDP-fucose from GDP-mannose (reviewed in Ref. 14Anderson D.C. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3955-3994Google Scholar). Even if this is true for some of these patients (reviewed in Ref. 14Anderson D.C. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3955-3994Google Scholar), most of them do not show an evident defect in sequence, expression levels, or enzymatic activity of the different enzymes involved in the GDP-fucose biosynthetic pathway. However, they clearly have a generalized defect in fucosylation of glycoprotein and glycolipids (reviewed in Refs. 13Thomas G.H. Beaudet A.L. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2529-2561Google Scholar and 14Anderson D.C. Kishimoto T.K. Smith C.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

The identification of a patient with normal levels of GDP-fucose and a defect in the translocation of GDP-fucose into the Golgi apparatus (12Lubke T. Marquardt T. von Figura K. Korner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25986-25989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) seems to fit into the pathogenesis of this disorder. Although genetic analysis of the patient seems to be the natural approach for the identification of such a gene, this strategy is not without difficulties, including the need for specific and selective techniques in order to generate transfectant cells and the possibility of finding a nonstructural gene. We recently succeeded in the purification of the rat liver Golgi membrane UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (15Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and ATP (16Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) transporters using functional reconstitution of the transport activity into phosphatidylcholine liposomes following Triton X-100 membrane extraction. Here we have used the same system to monitor the purification of the GDP-fucose transport activity from a rat liver Golgi membrane preparation. Column chromatography, glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, and photoaffinity radiolabeling with an azido derivative of GTP were used to identify a 39-kDa protein as the GDP-fucose transporter. Finally, native functional size determination on a glycerol gradient also suggested that the transporter exists as a homodimer in the membrane of the Golgi apparatus. Frozen rat livers were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR). GDP-[3H]fucose (5–15 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, 125INa iodine (350–600 mCi/ml) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Irvine, CA) Extracti-Gel G was purchased from Pierce. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. All of the operations described below were performed at 4 °C. A purified Golgi fraction was prepared from 250 g of frozen rat livers according to the procedure of Leelavathi et al. (17Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This fraction was resuspended in 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mmsucrose, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v) with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The suspension was stirred for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Ti50 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant solution (thereafter named first Triton X-100 extract) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in the above buffer containing a final concentration of 1.1% Triton X-100. The mixture was stirred and centrifuged again as described above. The supernatant (thereafter named second Triton X-100 extract) was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in the above buffer containing a final concentration of 1.5% Triton X-100. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged again as described above. The supernatant (thereafter named third Triton X-100 extract) was then adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5% Triton X-100. The above third Triton X-100 extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (Sigma; 1 × 1.5 cm) equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.0; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 1% glycerol; 0.5% Triton X-100). Elution was with 6 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl followed by 4 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.7 m NaCl. The 0.7 mNaCl-eluted material, containing the GDP-fucose transport activity, was then desalted and adjusted up to a final concentration of 20% glycerol and 0.5% Triton. The above fraction was applied to a Blue Sepharose column (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA; 1 × 1.5 cm each) equilibrated in buffer A containing 20% glycerol. The GDP-fucose transport activity eluted in the flow-through. This fraction was then applied to an 8–30% glycerol gradient. The apparent functional weight of the GDP-fucose transporter was estimated by analytical ultracentrifugation using an 8–30% glycerol gradient in buffer A. The active fraction obtained from purification step 3 was concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A using Centricon filters (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) to obtain a final glycerol concentration of 8%. The 10-ml glycerol gradient was equilibrated at 4 °C for 21 h before loading of the sample (1 ml) and then centrifuged in a SW 41 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 40,000 rpm for 52 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected. β-Amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), β-galactosidase (120 kDa), phosphorylase B (100 kDa), tumor necrosis factor α-convertase (80 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as internal molecular mass markers. The GDP-fucose transport activity was reconstituted in phosphatidylcholine liposomes (15Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated in the presence of different concentrations of GDP-[3H]fucose (400 cpm/pmol) for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was then applied to a 3-ml Dowex 1 × 2–100 column (Sigma) as described previously (19Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.35 ml were collected, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For the experiments of photoaffinity radiolabeling, rat liver Golgi vesicles were isolated as described (17Leelavathi D.E. Estes L.W. Feingold D.S. Lombardi B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 211: 124-138Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and resuspended in cryoprotective buffer (20Mandon E.C. Kempner E.S. Ishihara M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11729-11733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sialyltransferase activity was enriched ∼50-fold over the crude homogenate. Approximately 90% of the vesicles were sealed and of the same membrane topographical orientation as in vivo (21Carey D.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 989-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the following experiments were performed in a dark room in the presence of a filtered safe light. Fractions to be photolabeled were incubated with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate (0.2 μm final concentration) at 0 °C for 1 min in 25 μl of buffer A. The mixture was irradiated on ice for 1 min in a Stratalinker UV 2400 oven (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA; 5 cm of distance, maximum energy), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of loading buffer. Samples were then immediately subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography of the dried gel was done at −80 °C using Eastman Kodak Co. film. The purity of the various fractions active and inactive in GDP-fucose transport activity was determined by SDS-PAGE. Visualization was done by Coomassie Blue/silver nitrate staining (OWL Separation System, Woburn, MA) or by labeling proteins with 300 μCi of Na125I and chloramine T (22Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19351-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was quantitated using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). We have previously shown that transport of GDP-fucose into intact Golgi vesicles is temperature-dependent and saturable with aK m in the low micromolar range (23Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 24Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10811-10817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that it is inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS), a noncompetitive inhibitor of all nucleotide-sugar transporters (23Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To purify the GDP-fucose transporter, it was necessary to first reconstitute the transport activity into artificial vesicles (phosphatidylcholine liposomes) using a freeze-thaw system as described previously (18Milla M.E. Clairmont C.A. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 103-107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A purified Golgi vesicle fraction was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and treated sequentially with 0.3 and 1.1% of Triton X-100. These conditions removed more than 90% of the proteins but only ∼20% of the GDP-fucose transport activity (not shown). In the third and final Triton X-100 step, a higher concentration of detergent was used (1.5%, v/v) in order to completely solubilize membrane proteins. Less than 10% of the initial Golgi membrane protein was recovered in this fraction, together with ∼80% of the total GDP-fucose transport activity. This strategy resulted in a 35-fold purification of the transport activity over the Golgi membrane preparation. Aliquots of the above third Triton X-100 extract were then used to determine the specificity of the proteoliposome reconstitution assay. Fig. 1 shows that GDP-fucose transport into proteoliposomes was temperature-dependent, the values at 0 °C being 20% of those at 30 °C. Transport increased with the concentration of GDP-fucose in the incubation medium and was inhibited by DIDS, with ∼73% of inhibition in the presence of 30 μm DIDS (Fig. 1). Similar levels of inhibition had already been obtained using intact Golgi vesicles (23Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of the proteoliposomes with different concentrations of GDP-fucose, transport was saturable with an apparentK m of 2.1 μm (Fig. 2), very similar to the values obtained previously with intact Golgi vesicles (24Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10811-10817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since transport of nucleotide sugars into Golgi vesicles occurs via an equimolar exchange with the corresponding (luminal) nucleoside monophosphate, we determined whether or not GDP-fucose transport into proteoliposomes was stimulated by the presence of luminal GMP, the putative antiporter. As shown in Fig. 3, transport of GDP-fucose was stimulated ∼3-fold when proteoliposomes had been preloaded with 100 μm of GMP as compared with buffer alone. The third Triton X-100 extract used to characterize the GDP-fucose transport activity in vitro was the starting point for the next sets of experiments performed to identify and purify the GDP-fucose transporter. The above reconstitution assay was used to monitor the purification through the different chromatographic steps. The third Triton X-100 extract (Fig. 4,lane 1) was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column followed by elution with 700 mm NaCl in buffer A. 60% of the transport activity was recovered, with a 425-fold purification over the pure Golgi preparation (Fig. 4, lane 2). The active fraction from the DEAE-Sephacel column was then loaded onto a Blue Sepharose column. The transport activity was found in the flow-through (negative column) with a recovery of ∼57% of the initial activity and a ∼1500-fold overall purification (Fig. 4, lane 3). A summary of the different purification steps, including the glycerol gradient (see next step), is shown in Table I.Table IPartial purification of the Golgi membrane GDP-fucose transporterStepTotal proteinSpecific activityActivityPurification over pure Golgi membranesYieldmgpmol/mg in 5 minpmol in 5 min-fold%Triton extract5.0249124335100DEAE-Sephacel0.26289275242560Blue Sepharose0.0710,171712149057Glycerol gradient0.004102,20046015,00037 Open table in a new tab A glycerol gradient was then used as the next and final step of purification. The rationale for this was based on the fact that this technique had already been proven to be very useful for the purification and estimation of the functional size of other Golgi nucleotide derivative transporters (15Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In fact, nucleotide sugars, nucleotide sulfate, and ATP transporters, when solubilized in the presence of 0.5% Triton X-100, behave as homodimers (15Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The active fraction from the Blue Sepharose column was loaded on top of a 8–30% glycerol gradient and centrifuged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 A shows the profile of the GDP-fucose transport activity throughout the gradient with a peak in the 80-kDa area. When aliquots of different fractions from the gradient were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, several protein bands were visualized, but only one, with an apparent molecular mass of ∼39 kDa, was observed exclusively in active fractions and correlated with the GDP-fucose transport activity (Fig. 5). This latter strategy gave a ∼15,000-fold overall purification with a recovery of ∼37% of the initial activity. We have previously shown that 8-azidoguanosine-5′-triphosphate is one of the most effective competitive inhibitors of GDP-fucose transport into Golgi membrane vesicles (25Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to use photoaffinity radiolabeling with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate as a different and independent criterion to demonstrate that the transport activity is a protein of 39 kDa. We first subjected intact Golgi membrane vesicles to photolabeling with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate in the presence or absence of nonradioactive GDP-fucose. Although several bands could be visualized (Fig. 6, lane 1), a 39-kDa protein band was the only one to be protected after preincubation with different concentrations of nonradioactive GDP-fucose (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). In fact, it was almost completely protected in the presence of 5 μmGDP-fucose (Fig. 6, lane 2) and could not be visualized when 50 μm GDP-fucose was used (Fig. 6, lane 3). We finally reconstituted into proteoliposomes active and inactive fractions from the Blue Sepharose column and the glycerol gradient and subjected each of them to photolabeling. Only fractions active in GDP-fucose transport showed a radiolabeled protein band of 39 kDa (Fig. 7, lanes 1 and 3), while inactive fractions did not (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and4). Neither UV irradiation used without the photoprobe nor the photoprobe by itself, without UV irradiation, resulted in photolabeling of protein bands (results not shown). In the present report, we have identified, purified, and characterized the GDP-fucose transport activity from rat liver Golgi membranes. The transporter showed an apparent molecular mass of ∼39-kDa, and its identity was confirmed by functional reconstitution of the purified protein into liposomes as well as photoaffinity radiolabeling. In order to proceed toward the identification and purification of the above transport activity, we first reconstituted it into a liposome system that had already been proven successful for the purification of other nucleotide derivative transporters (15Puglielli L.

In such a system, the transport activity was shown to behave as in intact Golgi vesicles with regard to temperature dependence, inhibitory effect of DIDS, saturability, and apparent K m (23Capasso J.M.

The glycerol gradient resulted in a powerful step of purification and was also successful for the determination of the functional size of the transporter. In fact, following glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, the transporter migrated in the 80-kDa area, twice its apparent molecular mass as determined by reducing gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the GDP-fucose transporter is functionally a homodimer in Golgi membranes. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that nucleotide derivative transporters are arranged in the Golgi membrane as homodimers (reviewed in Ref. 1Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 203-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and with analogous results obtained by us with the PAPS (26Mandon E.C. Milla M.E.

Additional and independent evidence suggesting that the 39-kDa band is indeed the GDP-fucose transporter was obtained with photoaffinity radiolabeling using 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate, an azido derivative of GTP. When we photolabeled Golgi membrane vesicles with 8-azidoguanosine-5′-[α-32P]triphosphate, several bands were visualized, but only one, of 39 kDa, was protected from labeling when nonradioactive GDP-fucose was included in the labeling reaction. This result is in strong agreement with previous studies showing that nucleotide sugar transporters are highly specific (see Ref. 15Puglielli L. Mandon E.C. Rancour D.M. Menon A.K. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4474-4479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 1Abeijon C. Mandon E.C. Hirschberg C.B. Trends Biochem.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A 39-kDa protein band could also be visualized after functional reconstitution of fractions active for the GDP-fucose transport into proteoliposomes. The absence of radiolabeling of fractions that were inactive in GDP-fucose transport activity is consistent with these results. The recent identification of deficient translocation of GDP-fucose into Golgi vesicles from a patient affected by LAD II opens the question of whether or not the GDP-fucose transporter is involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder. While the final answer will only come when the gene that encodes the transporter is identified, purification of the rat liver Golgi membrane GDP-fucose transporter represents an important step toward this goal, since it will enable us to obtain the peptide sequence of the transporter and then proceed toward its cloning. This will in turn help us to identify the corresponding gene in humans, determine the biochemical characteristics of the transporter in the Golgi membrane, and study the possible involvement of the transporter in the pathogenesis of this new form of carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome."

Mutations in the HNF1α gene are associated with an autosomal dominant form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY3). More than 80 different mutations have been identified so far, many of which involve highly conserved amino acid residues among vertebrate HNF1α. In the present work, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which MODY3 mutations could affect HNF1α function. For this purpose, we analyzed the properties of 10 mutants resulting in amino acid substitutions or protein truncation. Some mutants have a reduced protein stability, whereas others are either defective in the DNA binding or impaired in their intrinsic trans-activation potential. Three mutants, characterized by a complete loss of trans-activation, behave as dominant negatives when transfected with the wild-type protein. These data define a clear causative relationship between MODY3 mutations and functional defects in HNF1α trans-activation. In addition, our analysis sheds new light on the structure of a homeoprotein playing a key role in pancreatic β cell function.

HNF1α is an atypical homeoprotein that binds as a dimer to palindromic cis-acting DNA elements related to the GTTAATnATTAAC consensus sequence. HNF1α and its close homologue HNF1β (vHNF1 or LF-B3) constitute a unique subfamily of homeoproteins. The two proteins share strong homologies in the dimerization and DNA binding domains and can form heterodimers that bind to the same DNA sequences (5De Simone V. De Magistris L. Lazzaro D.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All the residues essential for DNA recognition are located in the 281 amino-terminal amino acids of these proteins. The dimerization domain was mapped to the first 33 amino-terminal amino acids (2Chouard T. Blumenfeld M. Bach I. Vandekerckhove J. Cereghini S. Yaniv M.

This region can be bound by dimerization cofactor of HNF1, a small protein of 11 kDa that reduces the exchange rate of HNF1 molecules in both homodimer and heterodimer configurations (8Mendel D.B.

HNF1α contacts its cognate sites via an extra large homeodomain (81 amino acids), consisting of four α helices with a loop of 16 amino acids, instead of the usual three, between the helices 2 and 3 (11Ceska T.A.

A conserved sequence of 85 amino acids located between the dimerization domain and the homeodomain, previously defined as the B domain, is necessary for high-specificity DNA recognition (7Nicosia A.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4119-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was suggested to share a weak homology with the POU-A box; however this homology does not comprise the POU domain recognition helix, and it is not spaced correctly relative to the homeodomain. This region is highly conserved in both HNF1α and HNF1β of different species, and we will refer to it as the HNF domain. Finally, the carboxyl-terminal trans-activation domain extends from amino acid residue 282 to 631, including two proline-rich (29%) regions and a serine-rich (26%) region. Although initially assumed to be liver-specific, further studies have shown that HNF1α is not restricted to hepatocytes but is expressed in epithelial cells of the intestine, stomach, kidney proximal tubules, and pancreas (15Blumenfeld M.

The expression of HNF1α in the pancreas raised the possibility that it may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of pancreatic genes. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a subtype of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus inherited as an autosomal dominant genetic disease (17Froguel P. Vaxillaire M. Velho G. Diabetes Rev. 1997; 5: 123-130Google Scholar). Affected individuals are characterized by a primary insulin secretion defect that generally becomes clinically apparent before 25 years of age, without insulin resistance (18Byrne M.M. Sturis J. Menzel S. Yamagata K. Fajans S.S. Dronsfield M.J. Bain S.C. Hattersley A.T. Velho G. Froguel P. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1503-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Velho G.

Glucokinase is a key enzyme of the pancreatic glycolytic pathway, known to be a glucose sensor for regulating insulin secretion in response to glucose (27Matschinsky F. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L.

The molecular basis of the β cell insulin secretion defect in MODY1 and MODY3 is not known. The clinical course of MODY3 subjects is characterized by a more severe diabetes than MODY2, requiring oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin treatment (18Byrne M.M. Sturis J. Menzel S. Yamagata K.

Charpentier G. Froguel P. Diabetes Care. 1996; 19: 915-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). MODY3 represents the most common cause of early-onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In fact, it has been estimated to account for 30% of all MODY cases in France (22Vaxillaire M. Boccio V. Philippi A. Vigouroux C. Terwilliger J. Passa P. Beckmann J.S. Velho G. Lathrop G.M. Froguel P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the prevalence of the disease may be substantially higher than previously thought, given the wide range of the age of onset and the possible misdiagnosis of patients as insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Recent genetic studies of MODY3 kindreds have revealed a large spectrum of mutations in the HNF1α gene. So far, >80 different mutations (missense, nonsense, or frameshift) have been identified in the HNF1α sequence in association with the MODY3 phenotype (28Frayling T.M. Bulamn M.P. Ellard S.

These mutations are localized along the different functional domains of the protein and involve highly conserved amino acid residues, suggesting that MODY3 is accounted for by impaired HNF1α function. However, the exact nature of the molecular defects and the mechanisms that explain the dominant transmission of the mutations are unknown. These mutations could generate proteins that might interfere with the function of the protein encoded by the wild-type allele from the other homologous chromosome. To investigate this issue, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of a number of representative MODY3 mutations. This was done by transient transfection of native and/or mutant human HNF1α with a target reporter gene. Our results revealed that most of the mutations strongly affected protein stability. Some of them were defective in their DNA binding capacity or in trans-activation potential. Finally, several but not all of the mutants behaved as dominant negative effectors on the wild-type protein. In vitromutagenesis was carried out on full-length human HNF1α expression vector (34Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) from double-stranded 5981-kilobase plasmid DNA using high-fidelity thermostable Pfu DNA polymerase (QuikChange; Stratagene, La jolla, CA). The full-length and truncated mutants in the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-driven human HNF1α expression plasmid were generated by polymerase chain reaction using two oligonucleotides primers each complementary to opposite strands of the vector. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were 5′-CGAAGATGGTCAAGTCCTGCCTGCAGCAGCACAATATTCCACAGCGGGAGG-3′ (mutant Y122C); 5′-GCAGCAGCACAATATTCCACAGCAGGAGGTGGTCGATACCAC-3′ (mutant R131Q); 5′-GGCCTCAACCAGTTCCACCTGTCCCAACACC-3′ (mutant S142F); 5′-TCCCATGAAGACGCAGAAGCAGGCCGCCCTGTATACCTGGTACGTC-3′ (mutant R159Q); 5′-CCTGGTATGTCCGCAAGCAGTGAGAGGTGGCGCAGCAGTTC-3′ (mutant R171ter); 5′-GGAGGAACCGTTTCCAGTGGGGCCCAGCATCCCAGCAAATATTGTTCC-3′ (mutant K205Q); 5′-GGTTTGCCAACCGGCACAAAGAAGAAGCTTTCCGGCAC-3′ (mutant R272H); and 5′-CAGGCACAGAGTGTGCTGGTGATCAACAGCATGGGCAG-3′ (mutant P447L). The mutated nucleotides are underlined. To check the identity of each mutant plasmid by enzymatic digestion, we introduced in the vicinity of the point mutation some conservative nucleotide changes, when that was possible, to create or eliminate a restriction endonuclease site. We checked that nucleotide changes did not generate rarely used codons. For the construction of the two frameshift and deletion mutants, sense (5′-CGTAAGCTTGCGGTAGAGGA-3′) and antisense (5′-AAGTCTAGACTCACTGGAGGCCTGTGTCTGAGGT-3′) oligonucleotides modified to create a HindIII restriction site at position −20 and an XbaI site at position +1630, respectively, based on position +1 for the ATG of human HNF1α cDNA, were used as the primer set for the amplification of a TG-deleted fragment at codons 547–548 and a fragment containing one C insertion at codon 289. The TG deletion and the in frame stop codon are in the antisense primer. A second set of oligonucleotides with the C insertion at position +739 (sense, 5′-TCCCCATCACAGGCAC-3′) and position +858 (antisense, 5′-CTGGGGGGGGGCCCG-CTG-3′) were used as internal primers with the first set to yield the P291fsinsC mutated fragment. The HindIII-XbaI-digested fragments were inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in a pCDNA3 expression vector. Each of the 10 mutant plasmids was verified by DNA sequencing of proximal promoter and full-length HNF1α coding sequence to confirm the introduction of the desired mutations and to exclude other sequence changes. The C33 human epithelial cervical carcinoma cells (35Yee C. Krishnan-Hewlett I. Baker C.C. Schlegel R. Howley P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 361-366PubMed Google Scholar), which lack endogeneous HNF1α expression, were cultured and transfected as described previously (34Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For each transfection, a total of 5 μg of DNA were used, including 1 μg of the pβ283 reporter plasmid (36Courtois G. Morgan J.G. Campbell L.A. Fourel G. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1987; 238: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), varying amounts of HNF1α expression vectors, and 1 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase construct for normalization of transfection efficiencies. Amounts from 10 ng to 1 μg of wild-type or mutant HNF1α expression vectors were tested, and the total quantity of plasmids was maintained constant by adding suitable amounts of a pGEM3 plasmid. 40–48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and total cell extracts were prepared. CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (37Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three to five times with at least two different plasmid preparations. C33 cells (2.5 × 106 cells) were seeded into 10-cm Petri dishes and transfected with a similar amount (2.5 μg) of native or mutant HNF1α plasmids. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a cytomegalovirus enhancer-driven E2TR expression plasmid (38Demeret C. Yaniv M. Thierry F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7075-7082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transfected with HNF1α plasmid in a similar amount (2.5 μg) as an internal marker for transfection efficiency as well as reproductibility of nuclear extract preparation. Nuclear extracts from the transfected cells were prepared from two 10-cm Petri dishes essentially as described previously (34Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. A single-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CTTTAGTTAATATTTGACAGTTT-3′), corresponding to the HNF1α DNA binding element of the rat β-fibrinogen promoter, was end-labeled by using [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed with an excess (1.5-fold) of cold complementary oligonucleotide. For detection of E2TR DNA binding activity, the oligonucleotides were as follows: 36Y1 (5′-CTAGACAACCGATTTCGGTTGT-3′) and 36Y2 (5′-CTAGACAACCGAAATCGGTTGT-3′); 36Y1 was end-labeled as described above. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (34Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). C33 nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described above. 20 μg of protein extract were resolved by 7 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After control of equal loading by Ponceau staining, the membranes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10% dried milk for 30 min, and subsequently washed twice for 10 min in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and once for 10 min in PBS. The membranes were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-HNF1 antibody, rHNt-283, as described previously (40Chouard T. Jeannequin O. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. Traincard F. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). C33 cells were transfected as described above with 10 μg of native or mutant (Y122C and R159Q) HNF1α plasmids. To analyze protein stability, 40–48 h after transfection the cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with 35S-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine; Tran35S-label, ICN) and chased for various lengths of time in the presence of excess nonradioactive cysteine and methionine added to the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 3% dialyzed fetal calf serum culture medium. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in HNB buffer and 1% Nonidet P-40 as described above for nuclear extract preparation (39Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The nuclei were resuspended in 30 μl of cold RB buffer (60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml bastatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and then treated with 3 μl of DNaseI (10 units/μl) to reduce the viscosity by incubating for 5 min on ice with the enzyme in the presence of 4.5 mm MgCl2. Then the digestion of DNA was stopped by adding 6 μl of 166 mm EDTA, and the nuclear extracts were resuspended in 120 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with saturating amounts (2.5 μl) of rHNt-283 antibody according to standard procedures (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). C33 cells were grown and transfected onto 18-mm glass coverslips as described above. To assess the cellular localization of each mutant and wild-type HNF1α protein, we performed indirect immunofluorescence on the fixed cells. The cells on the coverslip were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, and then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, rinsed again in PBS, and incubated with the primary anti-HNF1α antibody, rHNt-283, in the same conditions as those described for the immunoblot analysis. The coverslips were then incubated with a fluorescein-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% FCS, rinsed twice in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and then in PBS, and mounted in antifade medium for viewing on a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope. Based on previous structural and functional studies of HNF1α and HNF1β, predictions could be made about the activity of some of the MODY3 mutations. It has been shown that deletions of the activation domain generate proteins that can still dimerize, bind DNA, and behave as dominant negative mutants on the activity of the normal protein (34Bach I. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4229-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Nicosia A. Tafi R. Monaci P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5321-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, the properties of point mutations were difficult to predict, because no single amino acid substitution has been previously analyzed. For this reason, we chose to evaluate the properties of 10 mutants in different domains of HNF1α (Fig. 1). Seven of them were point mutations resulting in amino acid substitution (Y122C, R131Q, S142F, R159Q, K205Q, R272H, and P447L); one was a nonsense mutation (R171ter), and two were frameshift mutations (P291fsinsC/ter and T547E548fsdelTG/ter) resulting in protein truncation. These mutations are responsible for the MODY3 phenotype in different families. The seven missense mutants and the amino-terminal truncated protein (R171ter) were introduced into the human HNF1α cDNA sequence and cloned into an expression vector under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat. The two carboxyl-terminal frameshift mutations of the same cDNA were introduced in a pCDNA3 expression vector under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The constructs were sequenced in their promoter and coding portions to ensure that additional mutations were not introduced during the mutagenesis step. To investigate whether HNF1α mutations affected nuclear translocation, we transfected the different mutants in C33 cells and monitored the subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence. Almost all of the mutant proteins tested gave a nuclear signal with antibodies prepared against the amino-terminal half of HNF1α, showing that they accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 2). For some of them (Y122C, S142F, R272H, and P291fsinsC(ter)), in a certain percentage of transfected cells, a faint signal was also detected in the cytoplasm. R171ter was, on the contrary, the only mutant that was abundantly localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. These results suggest that the nuclear import is normally operating for most of the mutants tested. To evaluate a possible defect in protein stability, we first evaluated the expression levels of the mutant proteins in the transfected cells by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, protein levels of mutants Y122C, R159Q, K205Q, and P447L were reduced compared with the wild type. Conversely, mutants R131Q, S142F, and R272H retained a relatively normal expression level. In agreement with previous studies, HNF1α protein migrates as a slightly diffuse band with an apparent molecular mass ranging approximately between 92 and 98 kDa (40Chouard T. Jeannequin O. Rey-Campos J. Yaniv M. Traincard F. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Strikingly, P447L was the only mutant that reproducibly appeared as a sharper band. A specific HNF1α fragment was detected with an amino-terminal anti-HNF1α antibody for the mutant R171ter as a weak band migrating with an apparent molecular mass <30 kDa. Finally, mutants P291fsinsC and T547E548fsdelTG were overproduced relative to the wild-type protein. To test whether the reduced protein levels obtained for Y122C and R159Q resulted from decreased stability of these mutant proteins, we performed pulse-chase experiments in transfected C33 cells followed by immunoprecipitation of mutant proteins. Upon very short labeling times (15 min) and before the chase, the protein level of both mutants was only partially reduced compared with the wild-type protein, indicating that the dramatically reduced protein levels observed at steady state could not be explained by a possible defective protein synthesis. Indeed, after the chase, the decline of both mutant proteins was much more pronounced when compared with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 and results not shown). From these data, we have estimated that the wild-type HNF1α half-life in C33 cells is ∼12 h, whereas for the mutant proteins it is only 2.5 h. Next, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to assess the specific DNA binding activity of the different mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 B, specific DNA binding activity was detected for mutants Y122C, R131Q, R159Q, K205Q, R272H, and P447L. The first five proteins showed the same mobility as that obtained with the wild-type HNF1α protein. Conversely, mutant P447L showed a slightly different migration pattern characterized by a band that migrated reproducibly slightly faster than the wild-type HNF1α band. The two carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants clearly showed a strong increase in the DNA binding activity that reflected their increased expression level. These proteins showed a faster mobility of the retarded complexes as previously reported for carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants and were able to heterodimerize with a cotransfected full-length wild-type protein (Ref. 43Sourdive D.J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. C R Acad. Sci. Sci. 1993; 316: 385-394PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). As expected, no binding activity was detected for mutant R171ter. Surprisingly, S142F lacked any DNA binding activity. To monitor the transfection efficiency and the quality of the nuclear extract preparation, we included in the transfection the papillomavirus-encoded E2TR protein expression vector (38Demeret C. Yaniv M. Thierry F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7075-7082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C shows that E2TR DNA binding activity was equally detected in each transfection. Comparison of the intensity of the retarded bands relative to the level of expressed proteins demonstrated that the two car"

This system consists of ArcB as the membrane-associated sensor kinase and ArcA as the cytoplasmic response regulator. ArcB is a tripartite kinase, possessing a primary transmitter, a receiver, and a secondary transmitter domain that catalyzes the phosphorylation of ArcA via a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay, as well as the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by a reverse phosphorelay. When ArcA and ArcB were incubated with ATP, the peak levels of phosphorylated proteins increased in the presence of the fermentation metabolitesd-lactate, acetate, or pyruvate. In this study, we report that these effectors accelerate the autophosphorylation activity of ArcB and enhance the transphosphorylation of ArcA, but have no effect on the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P. Moreover, the presence of the receiver domain of ArcB is essential for the effectors to influence the autophosphorylation rate of the primary transmitter domain of ArcB.

Moreover, the presence of the receiver domain of ArcB is essential for the effectors to influence the autophosphorylation rate of the primary transmitter domain of ArcB. In prokaryotes, environmental changes are often signaled by a family of two-component systems, resulting in adaptive gene expressions. Typically, such a system comprises a membrane-associated sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 2Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J.E. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Signal reception by the sensor kinase stimulates an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation at a conserved histidine residue in the cytosolic transmitter domain. Subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to a conserved aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the cognate response regulator. The phosphorylated response regulator in general serves as a transcriptional regulator. Upon cessation of signaling, both the cognate response regulator and the sensor kinase undergo dephosphorylation that results in silencing of the system. The Arc (anoxic redox control) two-component system ofEscherichia coli, consists of the ArcB protein as a transmembrane sensor kinase and the ArcA protein as the response regulator (3Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1888-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 4Iuchi S. Matsuda Z. Fujiwara T. Lin E.C.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Phosphorylated ArcA controls the expression of some 30 operons (the Arc modulon) in response to redox conditions of growth (5Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L.

ArcB contains three catalytic domains: an N-terminal transmitter domain (H1) with a conserved His-292 residue, a central receiver domain (D1) with a conserved Asp-576 residue, and a C-terminal secondary transmitter domain (H2) with a conserved His-717 residue (7Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ishige K. Nagasawa S. Tokishita S.-I. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5195-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Upon stimulation, ArcB autophosphorylates at the expense of ATP. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to ArcA by a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay, sequentially involving His-292 of H1, Asp-576 of D1, His-717 of H2, and Asp-54 of ArcA (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cessation or subsidence of stimulation, ArcA-P dephosphorylation occurs by reverse transfer of the phosphoryl group to His-717 of H2 and then to Asp-576 of D1, where release of Pi takes place. H1 plays no apparent role in the process of signal decay (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Signal transmission by His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay has also been reported for the Kin/Spo system of Bacillus subtilis (11Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), the Sln1p/Ypd1p/Ssk1p ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the BvgS/A of Bordetella pertussis (12Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and the TorS/R of E. coli (13Jourlin C. Ansaldi M. Méjean V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), although the number of proteins involved differs from system to system. In the absence of ArcB, phosphorylated ArcA (ArcA-P) is quite stable, exhibiting a half-life of more than 1 h (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By contrast, phosphorylated ArcB (ArcB-P), which can exist in numerous states of phosphorylation (singly phosphorylated at one of the three sites, doubly phosphorylated, or completely phosphorylated) is relatively labile (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, addressing the complex question of ArcB-P half-life remains a technical challenge. Iuchi reported (14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in a reaction mixture containing ArcB and ATP, the net autophosphorylation of ArcB reaches a peak in about 2 min and then decays. The presence of certain fermentation intermediates, namelyd-lactate (but not l-lactate which is not a fermentation product), acetate, and pyruvate, heightened the level of net ArcB phosphorylation. These results, together with the observation that the rate of release of Pi from the protein was retarded in the presence of d-lactate, led to the suggestion that the effectors inhibited autophosphatase activity. At that time, however, it was not known that ArcB mediates a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay and that ArcB serves also as an ArcA-P phosphatase. In a subsequent study of the phospho-decay pathway of ArcA-P, we failed to detect any influence of the effectors on this process (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The successful characterization of both the phosphorylating and the dephosphorylating pathways of the Arc system by the use of various combinations of the ArcB modules afforded us a chance to undertake a more systematic investigation of the mode of effector action. Here we present the results of experiments designed to analyze the influence of the effectors on the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation pathways. E. coli strain M15 and plasmids pREP4 and pQE30 were obtained from Qiagen Ltd. Plasmids pQE30ArcB78–778, pQE30ArcB78–520, pQE30ArcA, and pQE30ArcA′ used for expression of His-tagged derivatives of ArcB and ArcA, have been described previously (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S.

To create pQE30ArcB78–661,Asp-576→Ala, primers 5′-CCCGGATCCCATATGGAGCAACTGGAGGAGTCACGAC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGATCCATGCATCATTATGATTTACTGTTCTCTCTTCTGTCGTC-3′ were used in the polymerase chain reaction with pBB35 (7Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and NsiI and cloned between BamHI andPstI of pQE30. Plasmid pQE30ArcB78–778,Asp-576→Ala, His-717→Glnwas constructed by inserting the BamHI-EcoRV fragment from plasmid pQE30ArcB78–661, Asp-576→Alainto BamHI-EcoRV-restricted pQE30ArcB521–778,His-717 → Gln (10Georgellis D.

The DNA fragments cloned from polymerase chain reaction amplified material were verified by sequencing at Micro Core Facility of the Dept. of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Harvard Medical School. Expression and purification of the His6-tagged proteins were described previously (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ArcA′ (about 0.4 nmol) was carried out at room temperature in 20 μl of buffer A (33 mm HEPES at pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing ArcB78–778 (H1-D1-H2) (∼50 pmol) and 40 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). After 10 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 3% Triton X-100). H1-D1-H2 was separated from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration, using a Nanosep 30K device (Pallfiltron). The filtrate, containing ArcA′-P, was passed through a Nanosep 10K device, and the retained material was washed 4 times with 500 μl of buffer B and once with 500 μl of buffer A. Finally, the retained material containing ArcA′-P (essentially free of H1-D1-H2, nonhydrolized ATP and Pi) was diluted to a final volume of 200 μl with buffer A. Dephosphorylation assays were carried out at room temperature in mixtures of 35 μl containing ∼50 pmol ArcA′-P and 5 pmol of H1-D1-H2. At various time points, a 5-μl sample was withdrawn, mixed with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer, and kept on ice until the last portion was taken. The radioactivity of proteins, resolved on SDS-gels, was determined qualitatively by autoradiography with X-Omat AR (Eastman Kodak) and quantitatively by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Unless otherwise specified, autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation assays were carried out at 15 °C in the presence of 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 2 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products), 33 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. d-Lactate, acetate, and pyruvate were used at 1 mm. The reactions were initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP, terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels. Radioactivity of proteins, resolved in the gels, was determined qualitatively by autoradiography of the dried gels with X-Omat AR (Kodak) and quantitatively by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To probe the influence of the effectors on the phospho-transfer reactions, we used ArcB78–778 (hereafter referred to as H1-D1-H2), deprived of amino acid residues 1–77 that constitute the transmembrane segments. Absence of residues 1–77 of ArcB, facilitates the purification of H1-D1-H2, which is able to catalyze both the phosphorylation of ArcA (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). H1-D1-H2 was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP at 15 °C in the presence or absence of each of the metabolites (at 1 mm, which is within the physiological range), and the time course of protein net phosphorylation was followed. The low temperature enabled the observation of the initial reaction rate. We noted, however, that at temperatures substantially below 15 °C the specific activity of H1-D1-H2 was drastically lost, possibly because of conformational changes. As shown in Fig. 2, both the initial rate of H1-D1-H2 phosphorylation and the overall level of the phosphorylated protein were increased about 3-fold by the presence of 1 mmd-lactate. Acetate and pyruvate exerted similar effects, but to lesser degrees (Fig. 2). In agreement with a previous study (14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), l-lactate, which is not a fermentation product, did not affect the phosphorylation rate of H1-D1-H2 (data not shown). It is worthy of note that in the presence of d-lactate, the steady state level of protein phosphorylation in the reaction mixture was not reached within 300 s. Prolonged incubation eventually resulted in loss of radiolabel by H1-D1-H2-P in all incubation mixtures (data not shown), consistent with the results from previous studies, which were carried out at room temperature over a period of 20 min (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because d-lactate was most effective in raising the rate of ArcB net phosphorylation, the effect of this metabolite on the transphosphorylation of ArcA by ArcB was also examined. For this purpose, ArcA and H1-D1-H2 were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence ofd-lactate, and the time course of the reactions was followed. The rate of ArcA transphosphorylation by H1-D1-H2 was stimulated about 3-fold by the presence of the effector (Fig. 3), which is consistent with an earlier qualitative observation (14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the observation that the net rates of H1-D1-H2 autophosphorylation and ArcA transphosphorylation are both stimulated by d-lactate by about 3-fold, it seems unlikely that the effector acts by stimulating the rate of phosphoryl group transfer to ArcA. Because the net phosphorylation of both H1-D1-H2 and ArcA reflects the balance of the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, it is not clear in which reaction pathwayd-lactate exerts its effect. To clarify this issue, the rate of dephosphorylation of ArcA-P by H1-D1-H2, in the presence or absence of the effector, was next studied. It has been shown that the dephosphorylation of ArcA-P depends on a reverse phosphorelay pathway involving the sequential action of H2 and D1 of ArcB (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, a previous report suggested that the effectors act by inhibiting the autophosphatase activity of ArcB (14Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether any of the effectors act by inhibiting a step in the dephosphorylation pathway. To test this, ArcA1–136 (hereafter referred to as ArcA′), containing the receiver domain but lacking the helix-turn-helix domain (the presumptive DNA binding domain) was used. Removal of this domain facilitates the preparation of ArcA′-P, because, unlike the phosphorylated form of the intact protein, ArcA′-P does not aggregate during the purification process. It is also known that ArcA′ can be phosphorylated by H1-D1-H2 and that ArcA′-P can be dephosphorylated by H1-D1-H2 (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To prepare ArcA′-P, the protein was incubated with H1-D1-H2 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently isolated by ultrafiltration. ArcA′-P was then incubated with H1-D1-H2 in the presence or absence of the three metabolites, and the kinetics of the reactions were followed (Fig. 4). During the course of all four reactions, there was a rapid loss of radiolabel by ArcA′-P and a slight transient rise of labeled H1-D1-H2 followed by a gradual decay. None of the effectors showed any detectable effect on the rate of ArcA′-P dephosphorylation (Fig. 4). It thus appears that the phosphatase activity of ArcB is not modulated by the effectors, implying that they enhance the autophosphorylating activity of ArcB. Because His-292 was shown to be the autophosphorylating site of H1-D1-H2 (7Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Asp-576 is essential for the release of Pi by the phosphorylated protein (10Georgellis D. Kwon O. De Wulf P. Lin E.C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32864-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we generated ArcB78–778,Asp-576→Ala, His-717→Gln (hereafter referred to as H1-D1*-H2*) to test the effect ofd-lactate on the initial rate of ArcB autophosphorylation. The mutant protein was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of d-lactate, and the time course of the reaction was followed. As shown in Fig. 5, the rate of H1-D1*-H2* phosphorylation was at least 3-fold higher in the presence of d-lactate than in its absence. Moreover, prolonged incubation did not reveal any Pi release (data not shown). Because d-lactate enhances the net phosphorylation of H1-D1-H2 and H1-D1*-H2* at a similar rate, it seems most likely that the effect is exerted by accelerating the rate of autophosphorylation rather than inhibiting the rate of dephosphorylation. Although a direct answer regarding the dephosphorylation rate could be provided by determining the half-life of H1-D1-H2-P in the presence or absence of the effector, the lability of the phosphoprotein did not permit its isolation as an ATP-free preparation for such a study. Efforts were then made to localize the domain of effector binding. Because phosphorylation of H1-D1*-H2* can occur only at the primary transmitter domain, we tested the effect ofd-lactate on the phosphorylation of this individual domain. ArcB78–520 (H1) was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absenced-lactate. No effect of d-lactate on the rate of H1 phosphorylation was apparent (Fig. 6). By contrast, whend-lactate was added to a reaction mixture containing ArcB78–661, Asp-576→Ala (H1-D1*) and [γ-32P]ATP, a 3-fold enhancement of the level of protein phosphorylation occurred (Fig. 6), as in the case of H1-D1*-H2*- P (Fig. 5). It thus seems that either the effector binding site is located in D1 or the structural presence of D1 enables the effector to bind to H1. We have shown in this study that the effectors accelerated the autophosphorylation of the primary transmitter in the presence of the receiver domain, even when it is catalytically inactive (e.g.D1Asp-576→Ala). Although all of the proteins used lack the transmembrane segments of ArcB and some of the proteins sustained single or double amino acid substitutions, they exhibited the expected catalytic activities. Thus, it is most likely that the mechanisms of effector action observed in this study do not depart from the wild-type situation. If H1 autophosphorylation is the rate-limiting step and the phosphorelay is the sole means of ArcA phosphorylation by ArcB, then stimulation of H1 autophosphorylation by the effectors would be sufficient to raise the level of ArcA-P. However, there may be an additional pathway for ArcA phosphorylation by ArcB that responds differently to the effectors. Both in vivo experiments using ArcB alleles borne by multicopy plasmids (8Ishige K. Nagasawa S. Tokishita S.-I. Mizuno T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5195-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and in vitroexperiments with different ArcB modular units (9Georgellis D. Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5429-5435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed a weak, but significant, ArcA phosphorylating activity by H1. In this case the acceleration of H1 autophosphorylation would augment ArcA-P level by the additional route of direct phosphotransfer. Indeed, the in vivo work led to the suggestion that signal transmission via the H1 pathway responds to the cellular metabolic state and that the H2 pathway responds to the redox state of the cell (16Matsushika A. Mizuno T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3973-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The issue of single or dual pathway of signal transmission, however, would require further experimentation. In vivo experiments based on single copies of the various arcB alleles would be necessary. In addition, the in vitro effects of d-lactate, acetate, and pyruvate need to be confirmed by in vivoevidence based on the behavior of appropriate mutants strains. ArcB is a paradigm for a tripartite sensor kinase participating in a His-Asp-His-Asp phosphorelay and provides the first example of such a kinase whose activity may be physiologically modulated by defined effectors, in this case metabolic intermediates of fermentation pathways. The discovery that different ArcB modular units can be prepared in catalytically active forms adds further promise that better understanding of the mechanisms of ArcB signal transmission will hasten the characterization of other tripartate kinases of two-component systems."

We have recently demonstrated that the Grb10 SH2 domain interacts with both the Raf-1 and MEK1 kinases. Overexpression of Grb10 genes with mutations in their SH2 domains promotes apoptosis in cultured cells, a phenotype that is reversed by concomitant overexpression of the wild type gene. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation we now show that most of the Grb10 molecules are peripherally associated with mitochondria. Following insulin-like growth factor I or serum treatment, small pools of Grb10 can also be found at the plasma membrane and in actin-rich membrane ruffles, whereas overexpression of Grb10 leads to its mislocalization to the cytosol. Two-hybrid analysis shows that the Grb10-binding site on Raf-1 co-localizes with its Ras-binding domain. Finally, we show that the endogenous Grb10 and Raf-1 proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from a partially purified mitochondrial extract, an interaction that is enhanced following the activation of Raf-1 by ultraviolet radiation. Thus, we infer that Grb10 may regulate signaling between plasma membrane receptors and the apoptosis-inducing machinery on the mitochondrial outer membrane by modulating the anti-apoptotic activity of mitochondrial Raf-1.

The serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 transmits mitogenic signals as part of the Raf-MEK-ERK kinase cascade, although only a small proportion of total Raf-1 molecules are translocated to the plasma membrane by Ras and activated by other proteins (19Hall A. Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Recent work has revealed that Raf-1 is implicated in many other signaling events. During mitosis, cytoplasmic Raf-1 is activated independently of Ras, and its function does not include activation of the downstream MEK and ERK kinases (21Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, depending on the cell line or on its intracellular localization, Raf-1 can act either as a promoter or as an inhibitor of apoptosis (22Pritchard C. McMahon M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 23Lau Q.C. Brusselbach S. Muller R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1899-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Salomoni P.

Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1111-1116PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Raf-1 can be targeted to mitochondria by Bcl-2, resulting in increased resistance to apoptotic inducers (26Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar,27Majewski M. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Salomoni P. Slupianek A. Reiss K. Trotta R. Calabretta B. Skorski T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2815-2819PubMed Google Scholar). Such variation in function requires a complex regulatory system; Raf-1 can interact with a large number of proteins including Ras, 14-3-3, Hsp90, CSK, Ksr, MEK1, and others (20Morrison D.K.

To determine how Grb10 affects the activity or intracellular localization of its ligands, we attempted to confirm the intracellular localization of the endogenous protein by immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation. Previous results suggested that Grb10 is a soluble protein that becomes localized to the plasma membrane following insulin treatment (5Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J.

However, these investigations used antibodies that recognize several bands on immunoblots (possibly because they were raised against the well conserved SH2 domain) and also used cell lines that overexpress Grb10 and/or the insulin receptor. Using a more specific antibody, we found that, surprisingly, Grb10 is peripherally associated with the mitochondria, where it interacts with the local pool of Raf-1. These results suggest that interactions between these two proteins could be used to regulate apoptosis whose initiating steps are now known to occur on the mitochondrial outer membrane (35Green D. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 267-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 36Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev.

We subcloned a FLAG-tagged hGrb10ζ(R520L) gene (15Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

Expression of the wild type hGrb10ζ protein was found to inhibit large scale viral amplification, whereas the baculovirus protein p35 possibly protected the hGrb10ζ(R520L)-expressing Sf9 cells from apoptosis (38Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography on an anti-FLAG(M2) resin as described (39Knappik A. Pluckthun A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 754-761PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised by inoculating rabbits with 100 μg of hGrb10ζ(R520L) in Titer Max adjuvant (CytRx Corporation). Anti-Grb10 antibodies were affinity-purified with maltose-binding protein-hGrb10ζ-coupled Activated CH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-1 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's instruction (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa S3 cells were grown in calcium-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% Pluronic F68 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For ultraviolet treatment, cells were washed in PBS, irradiated with 100 J/m2 UV 254 nm, and maintained in serum-free media for 4 h. For immunofluorescence microscopy, we inoculated 5,000–15,000 cells into the wells of an 8-chambered glass or Permanox slide (Nunc). The next day, the cells were fixed 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice in PBS, permeabilized for 2 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and washed twice more in PBS. They were then blocked for 30 min in PBS + 10% FBS and incubated for 60 min with the primary antibodies in PBS + 10% FBS. The samples were washed four times with PBS, incubated 30 min with the fluorescent secondary antibodies, and washed four more times in PBS. Slides were mounted in ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and viewed with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope coupled to a Princeton Instrument CCD camera. Images were subsequently analyzed with Eclipse (Empix Imaging Inc.) and Photoshop (Adobe) software. Localization of Grb10 to the mitochondria and membrane ruffles were also observed with a Nikon Diaphot confocal microscope. The concentration of primary antibodies used were 1:100 for the preimmune and anti-Grb10 serum, 0.3 μg/ml for affinity-purified anti-Grb10 and 1:50 for the anti-CoxI mAb (Molecular Probes). Specific fluorescein isothiocyanate, lissamine-rhodamine, and Texas Red-coupled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Fluorescent phalloidin was obtained from Sigma and used at a dilution of 1:50. Although the quality and intensity of the signals were reduced, similar conclusions were reached with variations of the original protocol such as methanol fixation or using bovine serum albumin as a blocking agent. HeLa S3 cells were spun down, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml/2 × 107 cells of MS buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, Roche Molecular Biochemicals Protease inhibitor pellet). The cells were lysed in a Polytron (10 s at a setting of 6.5). Nuclei and unbroken cells were eliminated by three 10-min centrifugations at 1300 ×g. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000 × g yielding a mitochondria-enriched MP fraction. Finally the 17,000 × g supernatant was spun down for 30 min at 100,000 × g yielding the high speed pellet and soluble fractions. Mitochondrial-enriched fractions were also produced by the hypotonic lysis method as described (40Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 41.1-41.7Google Scholar). Purification of mitochondria by running the MP fraction through a discontinuous 1 m/1.5 m sucrose gradient was performed essentially as described (40Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 41.1-41.7Google Scholar). We used the plasmids and strains of the Interaction Trap System (41Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Current Protocols, Brooklyn, NY1994Google Scholar). Construction of the AD-Grb10/SH2, LexA-Raf-1, LexA-Raf-1(1–330), and LexA-Raf-1(331–649) plasmids has been described before (15Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The LexA-Raf-1(1–151) plasmid was obtained by removing aHindIII/XhoI insert from the LexA-Raf-1(1–330) plasmid. The additional LexA fusions containing fragments of the Raf-1 amino-terminal domain were produced by polymerase chain reaction amplification and confirmed by sequencing. Proteins from the MP fractions were diluted in MS buffer to 1 mg/ml, and the organelles were broken up by the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation. We incubated 250 μl of extract with either 500 ng of Santa Cruz Biotechnology Raf-1 (E10) mAb or 1 μl of either the preimmune or anti-Grb10 serums. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the antibodies were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed extensively in MS buffer, and boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. Raf-1 activity in immunoprecipitates was determined as described (42Kasid U. Suy S. Dent P. Ray S. Whiteside T.L. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1996; 382: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) except that the amount of activated ERK1 was estimated with a phospho-specific antibody (New England Biolabs). The hGrb10ζ(R520L)-FLAG protein (see “Materials and Methods”) was expressed in insect cells with a baculovirus vector, purified by affinity chromatography with the FLAG mAb, and then used to raise highly specific anti-Grb10 antibodies. When used to probe immunoblots of total protein extracts from COS-1 or HeLa cells, the antibodies recognize two major bands with apparent electrophoretic mobilities of 72 and 75 kDa (Fig. 1 A), which probably result from Grb10 splicing variants, of which at least four are known to exist in human cells (5Frantz J.D.

We also probed Triton-soluble extracts from a variety of human cell lines (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the ratios between the two major immunoreactive bands varied according to the lineage of the hematopoietic cells. Cells of the erythroleukemia (K562) and T-cell (Jurkat, RPMI 8402, Peer) lineages had more of the faster migrating form, whereas the slower migrating form was more abundant in the B-cell derived Daudi cells. The U937 and HL-60 cell lines expressed the faster migrating form exclusively. Serum and immunoglobulins that were affinity-purified on a maltose-binding protein-Grb10 resin were used to detect the intracellular localization of endogenous Grb10 in COS-1 and HeLa cells. As seen in Fig. 2 B, most of the endogenous Grb10 is localized to a number of large vesicular structures that were identified as mitochondria by co-localization with a mAb that recognize the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (CoxI) (Fig. 3 A). Labeling is also seen on the nuclei and, to a lower extent, in the cytoplasm, but reaction with preimmune serum has shown these to be nonspecific signals. Mitochondrial localization was also observed in HeLa cells, the original source of the hGrb10ζ cDNA, although lower expression levels of endogenous Grb10 (Fig. 1 A) and a much higher background made interpretation of its localization more difficult (Fig. 2, E and F). In both cell lines, a 2-min treatment with 10% serum (not shown) or 100 ng/ml of IGF-I (Fig. 2 C) induced the relocalization of a small proportion of the endogenous Grb10 to the plasma membrane where it can theoretically interact with activated receptors. This translocation is very transient and is generally not observed 5 min after hormone treatment (not shown). After 30 min, some cells show a punctuate staining, which does not co-localize with the CoxI mitochondrial marker (Fig. 2 Dand not shown). Because this latter localization was observed only in a minority of cells, we did not study it further. Serum treatment of COS-1 cells induces the formation of actin-rich membrane ruffles, and, as shown in Fig. 3, these also became a site of Grb10 localization. Finally, Fig. 4 shows that overexpression of a FLAG-tagged hGrb10ζ in either COS-1 or HeLa cells results in its mislocalization to the cytoplasm. Identical results were obtained with GFP-Grb10 fusions. A small proportion of the Grb10 protein is still translocated to the plasma membrane shortly following serum treatment (not shown).FIG. 3Co-localization of endogenous Grb10 with mitochondria and membrane ruffles. Starved COS-1 cells were treated with 10% FBS for 30 min and probed with anti-Grb10 serum (green) along with either CoxI mAb (A) or rhodamine-phalloidin (B, red).

In B, arrows indicate non-transfected cells where localization of the endogenous Grb10 is visible. Magnification is either 1000× (A) or 400× (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the immunocytochemistry results, HeLa S3 cells were lysed in isotonic buffer and fractionated by differential centrifugation. The MP is enriched in mitochondria, peroxisomes, and large vesicles from the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. The plasma membrane and most of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi proteins were found in the high speed pellet, whereas cytosolic proteins are found in the high speed supernatant. Most of the endogenous Grb10 is found in the MP fraction (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, unlike attached HeLa cells that express equal amounts of the 72- and 75-kDa hGrb10 variants, the suspended HeLa S3 cells express mostly the 72-kDa variant. Furthermore, overexposing the Grb10 immunoblot revealed a band of 68 kDa mobility that is restricted to the soluble fraction and whose size is consistent with the hGrb10β variant, which is missing most of its PH domain (11Liu F. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10287-10291Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PH domains are potential membrane-binding elements (44Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). As expected, the MP fraction is enriched with mitochondrial markers such as CoxI and Bcl-2, residents of the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane, respectively (45Hackenbrock C.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1981; 15: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 46Riparbelli M.G. Callaini G. Tripodi S.A. Cintorino M. Tosi P. Dallai R. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 also localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, which explains its presence in the high speed pellet fraction (47Akao Y. Otsuki Y. Kataoka S. Ito Y. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2468-2471PubMed Google Scholar). Although members of the mitogenic MAP kinase pathway are mostly found in soluble form, a significant proportion of the Raf-1 and MEK1 kinases are associated with both membrane fractions. The ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases are almost exclusively found in the soluble fraction, thus demonstrating that our membrane fractions are not significantly contaminated by nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The samples used in Fig. 5 A were equalized for protein content, but because the yields of soluble proteins are usually 4–6 times higher than membrane proteins, the proportion of target protein localized to the cytosol may be underestimated. Repeating the fractionation procedure while maintaining each fraction in the same volume did not significantly change the fractionation results (Fig. 5 B). We also noted that the association of Grb10 and Raf-1 with the organelles of the MP fraction is relatively weak. A commonly used cell fractionation protocol, in which cells are first lysed in hypotonic buffer followed by a rapid return to isotonic conditions, caused enough damage to the mitochondrial membranes to release most of the Grb10 and Raf-1 proteins to the soluble fraction even though the fractionation of intramitochondrial proteins, such as CoxI, was maintained (Fig. 5 C). Finally, we further purified mitochondria by centrifugation of the MP fraction through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Fig. 6 shows that endogenous Grb10 can easily be detected in these highly purified organelles.FIG. 6Grb10 is a peripheral mitochondrial protein. Highly purified mitochondria were resuspended in either isotonic buffer or an alkaline solution (100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.5) and centrifuged. Equal amounts of the supernatant (S) and pelleted (P) fractions were then probed with either anti-Grb10 serum or CoxI mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined the nature of the Grb10-mitochondria interaction. Purified mitochondria were pelleted and resuspended in either isotonic buffer or a highly alkaline (pH 11.5) solution. The latter breaks open the organelles into linear membrane sheets, which can then be purified by high speed centrifugation (48Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the alkali treatment induces a relocalization of Grb10 from the pelleted to the soluble fraction indicating that it is not a transmembrane protein. As expected, CoxI remained in the pellet fraction, whereas Raf-1 showed a distribution identical to Grb10 (not shown). In a previous report (15Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we showed that Grb10 and Raf-1 can interact in a two-hybrid assay but that their co-immunoprecipitation from total protein extracts was only possible following overexpression of a tagged Grb10 protein. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we determined that the Grb10-binding site on the Raf-1 amino-terminal domain maps closely to the Ras-binding domain (Fig. 7). A more detailed mapping of the interaction site was impeded by the ability of many of our constructs to activate transcription nonspecifically. Furthermore, we show that a Raf-1 monoclonal antibody can efficiently co-immunoprecipitate endogenous levels of Grb10 from a Triton-solubilized MP protein extract (Fig. 8 A). As mitochondrial Raf-1 becomes activated following UV irradiation, its affinity for Grb10 also appears to increase (Fig. 8 B). 4 h following UV treatment, we did not observe significant changes in the amounts or intracellular localization of either Raf-1 or Grb10. As the cells enter apoptosis, degradation of these proteins becomes apparent after 20 or 24 h, respectively (not shown). Finally, Fig. 8 A also shows that our anti-Grb10 antibodies are inefficient in immunoprecipitating native Grb10.FIG. 8Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Grb10 and Raf-1. A, Grb10 immunoblot of mitochondrial protein extracts immunoprecipitated either with anti-Raf-1 mAb, preimmune serum, or anti-Grb10 serum. In the control lane, 10% of the extract used in the immunoprecipitations was loaded. B, Grb10 (top panel) or Raf-1 (middle panel) immunoblots of mitochondrial proteins extracts purified from starved or UV-treated cells and immunoprecipitated with a Raf-1 mAb. The bottom panel shows the amount of phosphorylated glutathioneS-transferase-ERK1 following an immunocomplex kinase assay of the Raf-1 immunoprecipitates. The endogenous activity of the glutathione S-transferase-MEK1 kinase was estimated in a reaction that omitted the immunoprecipitate (control lane).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We demonstrate that, unexpectedly, the intracellular localization of the adapter protein Grb10 is mostly mitochondrial. Depending on growth conditions, a small proportion of Grb10 was also found on the plasma membrane as well as membrane ruffles. These observations were made possible by the production of a new highly specific antibody. Because of the low intensity of the specific labeling, we also probed our cells with preimmune sera from the same animal that was used for the production of the Grb10 antibodies. This control confirmed the nonspecificity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence. Mitochondrial localization of Grb10 was confirmed by cell fractionation experiments showing that most of the endogenous Grb10 is found in the mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane fraction. Grb10 was also detected in purified mitochondria that were isolated though a discontinuous sucrose gradient. The population of Grb10 that is found in the light membrane fraction most probably represents those molecules that localize to the plasma membrane and membrane ruffles. The latter are the site of localization for many other signaling molecules involved in regulating the mitogenic MAP kinase pathway, most significantly Ras and Grb2 (49Bar-Sagi D. Rotin D. Batzer A. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1993; 74: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 50Kim B. Leventhal P.S. White M.F. Feldman E.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4881-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our experiments further corroborate several reports that suggested the existence of a significant pool of Raf-1 kinase on the mitochondria (24Salomoni P. Wasik M.A. Riedel R.F. Reiss K. Choi J.K.

The association of endogenous Grb10, and especially Raf-1, with the mitochondria is easily lost under harsher cell disruption conditions, which explains contradictory results from other laboratories (5Frantz J.D. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Ottinger E.A. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2659-2667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

J. 1997; 324: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Grb10 lacks any apparent mitochondrial localization sequence. This, together with the fact the fact that overexpressing the protein leads to its mislocalization to the cytoplasm, and its peripheral association with membranes suggests that it uses a relatively low abundance lipid or protein as an anchor. One possible candidate for such an anchor is Raf-1 itself, which can be targeted to the mitochondria by Bcl-2 (26Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was discounted because we estimate that there are approximately the same number of Grb10 and Raf-1 molecules per cell, 3A. Nantel and D. Y. Thomas, unpublished data. whereas only about 10% of total Raf-1 is localized to mitochondria. Furthermore, isotonic lysis of the cells completely releases Raf-1 while still retaining some Grb10 in the MP fraction. Another possibility is that Grb10 localization is mediated via its PH domain, which has been, in other proteins, shown to interact with phospholipids (44Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositols have been identified in mitochondrial membranes, but there is very little published data in this area (53Tran D. Gascard P. Berthon B. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Giraud F. Claret M. Cell Signal. 1993; 5: 565-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 54Bothmer J. Markerink M. Jolles J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In further support of this hypothesis, a minor Grb10 variant, whose mobility is consistent with the PH domain-deleted hGrb10β, is found only in the soluble fraction. In our initial report on the interaction of Grb10 with Raf-1, their co-immunoprecipitation was only possible following overexpression of a tagged Grb10 (15Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), most probably because only a fraction of total Raf-1 proteins co-localize with endogenous Grb10 (Fig. 5). However, both proteins were easily co-immunoprecipitated following partial purification of the mitochondria, thus demonstrating that they indeed do interact in vivo. The affinity of Grb10 for mitochondrial Raf-1 is increased following the activation of this kinase by ultraviolet light. This result is consistent with the relative co-localization of the Grb10-binding site with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1. Studies of Ras-Raf interactions have shown this domain to be relatively inaccessible when the kinase is inactive (20Morrison D.K. Cutler R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 28Winkler D.G. Cutler Jr., R.E. Drugan J.K. Campbell S. Morrison D.K. Cooper J.A. J. Biol.

The interaction of Grb10 with the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial Raf-1 kinase and our earlier results on the pro-apoptotic effects of Grb10 mutants (15Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggest that Grb10 could be used to regulate programmed cell death by modulating the activity of mitochondrial Raf-1. We thus propose that one of the functions of Grb10 is to serve as a link between plasma membrane receptors and the apoptosis-controlling complex on the mitochondrial outer membrane probably in collaboration with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which plays a role in mediating the anti-apoptotic activity of the insulin and IGF-I receptors (56O'Connor R.

Although thehGH-N promoter contains functional binding sites for multiple transcription factors, including Sp1, Zn-15, and Pit-1, predictable and developmentally appropriate expression ofhGH-N transgenes in the mouse pituitary requires the presence of a previously characterized locus control region (LCR) composed of multiple chromatin DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS).

These factors are brought into functional concert by binding to multiple classes of gene regulatory determinants, leading to the appropriate induction of transcription (reviewed in Ref. 1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). One class of regulatory elements appears to function primarily at the level of chromatin structure. The role of these elements is to establish transcriptionally competent domains that are available for interactions with the appropriate trans-factors. These chromatin elements are most reliably detected and mapped based on their ability to support expression of linked transgenes independent of the site of integration in the host genome (2Grosveld F. Bloom B. van Assendelft D. Greaves R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). When detected in the mammalian genome, these elements are termed locus control regions (LCRs1; reviewed in Ref. 3Kioussis D. Festenstein R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Components of locus control regions, which may be situated at significant distances from their target genes, can be identified by their ability to establish DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in the chromatin of expressing tissues. The mechanism for LCR function is inferred to be biphasic, involving the initial alteration of chromatin structure and subsequent transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref.4Kamakaka R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The human growth hormone gene, hGH-N, is the 5′-most member of a five-gene cluster on chromosome 17. These genes share greater than 95% sequence identity and encode structurally similar proteins (5Seeburg P.H. DNA. 1982; 1: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Despite this structural similarity, the hGH-N gene is expressed exclusively in the somatotropes and lactosomatotropes of the anterior pituitary, while the remaining genes of the cluster (hCS-L, hCS-A, hGH-V, andhCS-B) are expressed exclusively in the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placental villi (6MacLeod J.N.

This tissue specificity does not appear to be attributable to proximal transcriptional control elementsper se, as evidenced by the similar expression ofhGH-N and the placenta-specific genes in transfected pituitary cells (9Nickel B.E. Kardami E. Cattini P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 267: 653-658Google Scholar). Furthermore, retention of as much as 7.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence in cis to the hGH-N gene is insufficient to recapitulate appropriate levels and specificity of expression in transgenic mice (10Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These data suggest the participation of distal regulatory element(s) in the developmental activation of hGH-N gene expression. A set of DNase I HS located between 14.5 and 30 kb upstream of the hGH gene cluster has been identified exclusively in pituitary and placental chromatin (HS I–V; Fig. 1). The tissue-specific nature of these sites implies that they play a role in regulation of the hGH gene cluster. Human GH-N transgenes with extensive 5′-flanking regions encompassing these remote HS are expressed at high levels and in a position-independent and copy number-dependent manner in the mouse pituitary. These data indicate that these DNase I HS constitute an LCR for the hGH gene cluster and that the transgenic mouse is an appropriate model system in which to study its function (10Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The somatotrope-specific determinants of the LCR map to the region marked by two closely linked HS approximately 14.5 kb 5′ to thehGH-N gene (HS I,II; Fig. 1) (10Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). HS I,II activity was initially isolated on a 1.6-kb fragment and was subsequently sublocalized to a 404-bp segment (the F14 segment) (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This F14 segment is sufficient to confer high level, somatotrope-specific, and position-independent expression of a linked hGH-N gene in transgenic mouse pituitary. Furthermore, the F14 segment mediates appropriately timed induction of the linked hGH-N transgene during mouse embryonic development, paralleling induction of the endogenous mGH gene (11Bennani-Baiti I.M.

In the present study, we identified multiple binding sites for the POU domain transcription factor Pit-1 within the F14 segment of the HS I,II region and have established that these sites are essential components of LCR-mediated gene activation in the pituitary in vivo. The previously described F14 segment contains the 3′-terminal 404 bp of the 1602-bp HS I,II sequence (GenBankTM accession no.AF039413). DNA fragments used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and DNase I footprinting assays were generated by PCR using a plasmid (pHSI, II-11) containing the 1602-bp HS I,II region as a template. PCRs consisted of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.5 μm each primer, 10 ng of template DNA, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a total of 100 μl. Primers for fragments F14.1, F14.2, F14.3, F14.4, and F14.5 were designed to add EcoRI sites to both ends of the resulting PCR product to allow 3′-end labeling (Table I). The end points of these fragments relative to the 1602-bp HS I,II region are as follows: F14.1, 1164–1279; F14.2, 1275–1359; F14.3, 1356–1455; F14.4, 1435–1524; F14.5, 1520–1602. The F14 region DNase I footprinting probe containing nucleotides 1164–1525 was amplified with primers designed to add anEcoRI site at one end of the amplicon to allow the sense strand relative to hGH-N to be 3′-end-labeled. The 3′-ends of probes digested with EcoRI were radiolabeled using [α-32P]dATP and Klenow DNA polymerase. Fragments F14.3.1, F14.3.2, F14.3.3, and F14.3.4 were generated by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides and 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase.

Pituitaries excised from multiple CD-1 mice were placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. After removing the supernatant, the pituitaries were incubated in dissociation buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 min at room temperature and then disaggregated by repeated pipetting, and the larger material was allowed to sediment. The buffer and dissociated cells were removed to a tube containing 40 ml of cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. This process was repeated until the pituitary tissue was completely dissociated. Protein-DNA complexes were detected in vitro on the basis of changes in the electrophoretic mobility of a radiolabeled DNA probe (15Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Binding reactions (25 μl) contained 5 ng of an end-labeled, double-stranded DNA fragment in buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 32 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.08 g/liter poly(dI-dC), and 0.3 g/liter bovine serum albumin. Nuclear extract (4 μg) was added last, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide (25:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel in 2× Tris-glycine buffer at 150 V for 2–3 h. When necessary, unlabeled competitor DNA was added prior to the addition of nuclear extract. For supershift experiments, 2 μg of polyclonal Pit-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal Pit-1 (Transduction Laboratories) antibody was added at the end of the initial 20-min binding reaction, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min prior to gel loading. Regions of the HS I,II F14 region protected by bound proteins were detected by cleavage with DNase I (16Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). Binding reactions (80 μl) contained 5 ng of a 3′ end-labeled, double-stranded DNA fragment, 12 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 48 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2 g/liter poly(dI-dC), and 80 μg of GH3 cell nuclear extract. Control reactions without nuclear extract were supplemented with an equal volume of nuclear extract diluent. Samples of unbound DNA (no added protein) were digested with 1 μl of 10 ng/μl DNase I (Sigma) for 60 s at room temperature, and samples of bound DNA (with nuclear extract) were digested with 1 μl of 100 ng/μl DNase I for 180 s at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. DNA was purified from the binding reactions by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of yeast tRNA and resolved on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide (20:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 7 m urea gel in 0.5× TBE at 2000 V for 1–2 h. Chemical sequencing reactions were performed by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (17Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). DNA subfragments of the HS I,II region were generated by PCR as described above using a plasmid (pHSI, II-11) containing the 1602-bp HS I,II region as a template. Primers were designed to add an XhoI restriction site to the 5′-end and a HindIII restriction site to the 3′-end of the amplicons (relative to the transcriptional orientation of the hGH-N gene) for subsequent cloning (Table II). The F14, F14Δ.3, F14mut5′Pit-1, F14mut3′Pit-1, and F14mut5′,3′Pit-1 fragments all included nucleotides 1198–1602 of the HS I,II region. In the F14Δ.3 deletion mutant, nucleotides 1357–1456 were deleted. The F14.3 fragment extends from nucleotide 1357 to 1456 of the HS I,II region. Deletion and point mutations were introduced into the F14 fragment by SOE (splicing by overlap extension) PCR as described (18Vallejo A.N. Pogulis R.J. Pease L.R. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1995: 603-612Google Scholar). After digestion with XhoI andHindIII, PCR fragments were cloned into pBSIIKS-hGHN digested with XhoI and HindIII, upstream of thehGH-N gene. This plasmid contains the 2.6-kbEcoRI fragment R2 (19Chen E.Y. Liao Y.-C. Smith D.H. Barrera-Saldana H.A. Gelinas R.E. Seeburg P. Genomics. 1989; 4: 479-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) cloned into the EcoRI site of pBSIIKS (Stratagene).

Open table in a new tab DNA constructs released from vector sequences by BssHII digestion were resolved on agarose gels, recovered with glass beads, purified by Elutip (Schleicher and Schuell), and diluted to 3 ng/μl in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA. One-picogram aliquots of DNA were microinjected into fertilized C57BL/6J × SJL oocytes. Twenty-two eggs were reimplanted into each pseudopregnant recipient, and the mothers were sacrificed 18.5 days postcoitus (embryonic day 18.5). Placental DNA was analyzed for transgene DNA by dot blotting. Relative transgene copy numbers for each embryo were estimated by comparing the hybridization signal from an hGH-N gene probe to that from an endogenous mouse ζ-globin gene probe on duplicate blots. Each embryo was bisected with a parasagittal incision, fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin, and the pituitary was located by serial sectioning. A highly specific anti-hGH monoclonal antibody has been previously described (mAb 9) (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Anti-rat growth hormone, which cross-reacts with mGH, was obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Sections of paraffin-embedded mouse embryos (4–5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Anti-rat growth hormone was used at a 1:2500 dilution, and mAb 9 was used at 1:1500; incubations were for 24 h at room temperature. The specificity of immunostaining was documented by nonimmune sera and by competition with purified hGH (Dako). All reactions were visualized with streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase (Autoprobe III detection system; Biomeda) and were revealed with the chromagen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Colocalization of hGH and mGH was determined by staining adjacent sections. Scoring of embryos was performed by an individual who was blind to transgene presence or identity. Because of the nonquantitative nature of the immunohistochemistry assay and the fact that HS I,II alone does not confer copy number dependence (10Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), expression level per transgene copy was not addressed. Copy number was determined to control for the range of copy numbers carried by the embryos analyzed, such that only those carrying a parallel range of copy numbers of each construct were compared. It should be noted that although some of the hGH-positive embryos carried a relatively high transgene copy number, this did not bias the staining assay or expression data because F14Δ.3-GH embryos with comparable copy numbers were all negative for hGH-Nexpression. Formation of HS I,II of the hGH LCR is specific to nuclear chromatin from pituitary cells (Fig. 1) (10Jones B.K. Monks B.R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7010-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The determinants of HS I,II involved in the somatotrope-specific activation of the linkedhGH-N transgene have been localized to a 404-bp subsegment, F14 (nucleotides 1198–1602 in GenBankTM accession no.AF039413) (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted sequence analysis of this region identified multiple potential trans-factor binding sites, some of which are recognized by ubiquitous transcription factors and nuclear hormone receptors that could possibly contribute to its function. However, no motifs were identified that fit the pituitary-specific profile of F14 activity. To determine whether F14 could interact with one or more pituitary-specific factors, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extract from the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and the mouse presomatotrope cell line GHFT1, as well as from the growth hormone-expressing rat somatotrope cell line GH3 and primary mouse pituitary cells. As an initial control to confirm the phenotypes of these four extracts, each was incubated with a probe containing a binding site for the pituitary-enriched POU domain transcription factor Pit-1 (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the known phenotypes of each of the cells, strong binding to the Pit-1 probe was observed with extracts from the GHFT1, GH3, and mouse pituitary nuclei but not with NIH3T3 nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A). The Pit-1 complexes formed by the three pituitary cell lines consisted of a strong doublet. An additional minor Pit-1 complex of higher mobility was formed by the two extracts originating from the mature somatotrope cells (GH3 and primary pituitary; Fig. 2 A). The presence of multiple Pit-1 complexes was attributed to the presence of multiple isoforms of Pit-1 (reviewed in Ref. 20Rosenfeld M.G. Bach I. Erkman L. Li P. Lin C. Lin S. McEvilly R. Ryan A. Rhodes S. Schonnemann M. Scully K. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 217-238PubMed Google Scholar) and was not further explored. To screen the F14 segment of HS I,II for protein binding, the 404-bp segment was divided into five partially overlapping probes: F14.1, F14.2, F14.3, F14.4, and F14.5 (Fig. 2 B). Each of these probes was initially screened by incubation with GHFT1 and fibroblast (NIH/3T3) extracts. Whereas all five subfragments formed a variety of weak complexes that were largely observed in both the fibroblast and the GHFT1 extracts, a distinct and strong GHFT1-specific doublet complex was assembled on the F14.3 probe (Fig. 2 B;lane 9). Incubation of this F14.3 probe with the full set of nuclear extracts demonstrated formation of the strong doublet by proteins from each of the somatotrope-related cell lines (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3–5). The same doublet was also assembled on the F14.1 probe, although this complex was much less intense (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). The doublet complex could be self-competed by the addition of a 10- and 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled F14.3 and F14.1 segments, indicating that the corresponding interactions were sequence-specific (Fig. 2 C, lanes 6–15). The F14.1 fragment was a weaker competitor than F14.3, consistent with the weaker intensity of these complexes on an F14.1 fragment probe (Fig. 2 B; compare lane 3 with lane 9). Thus, the F14 segment of the HS I,II LCR determinant bound to one or more pituitary-specific nuclear proteins, and these binding sites were localized to two subdomains, F14.1 and F14.3. The complexes that formed on the F14.1 and F14.3 probes were noted to be strikingly similar in gel migration to Pit-1 complexes (compare Fig. 2 C,lanes 3–5, with Fig. 2 A). In addition, the Pit-1, F14.1, and F14.3 probes all formed the intense doublet complex specifically with the nuclear extracts from the three pituitary cell types (double arrows in Fig. 2,A–C). This comparison suggested that the complexes forming on F14.1 and F14.3 contained Pit-1. This hypothesis was confirmed by supershift reactions using polyclonal and monoclonal Pit-1 antibodies. The intensity of the pituitary-specific complexes formed by all three pituitary cell nuclear extracts was diminished by the presence of the antibody, with the concomitant appearance of multiple supershifted complexes (Fig. 2 D and data not shown). The complexes formed by the NIH/3T3 nuclear extract were unaffected by the Pit-1 antibody (data not shown). As an additional test for the presence of Pit-1 in these complexes, the control oligonucleotide containing a known Pit-1 binding site was used as a cold competitor. The somatotrope-specific complexes were specifically competed by a 30-fold molar excess of the Pit-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 D , lane 4). The high mobility Pit-1 complex specific for GH3 and mouse pituitary nuclear extracts was efficiently competed but inefficiently supershifted (Fig. 2 D, comparelanes 3 and 4), possibly indicating a minor Pit-1 isoform with a different topology than that of the major 30–33-kDa isoform immunogen. The same antibody supershift and competition experiments were performed with the labeled F14.1 subfragment probe, and the outcome was the same (Fig. 2 D,lanes 5–8). Therefore, the full set of EMSA studies indicated that the pituitary-specific complexes formed on the F14.3 and F14.1 probes were due to Pit-1 binding. The EMSA studies detailed above did not define whether Pit-1 was binding to a single site or to multiple sites within the target F14 probes. Because of the relatively loose consensus Pit-1 recognition motif (21Andersen B. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29335-29338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was difficult to predict the exact site(s) of Pit-1 binding. To directly sublocalize the Pit-1 binding site(s), F14.3 was divided into four partially overlapping subfragments. These subfragments were then characterized by EMSA, and Pit-1 content in complexes was confirmed by probe competition and antibody supershift studies. Strong somatotrope-specific complexes selectively formed on both the F14.3.1 and F14.3.4 fragments (Fig. 3 A). These complexes were identical with each of the two probes and were readily inhibited by a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled Pit-1 probe (lanes 4 and 19) but not by the same probe carrying an inactivating Pit-1 mutation (lanes 5 and20). These complexes were also supershifted by the polyclonal Pit-1 antibody (lanes 6 and21) as well as by a monoclonal antibody raised against rat Pit-1 (lanes 7 and 22). The F14.3.2 fragment formed a very weak Pit-1-containing complex that could only be clearly documented by antibody supershift (lane 11). Using a similar scanning EMSA strategy, the Pit-1 binding seen with the F14.1 subfragment was localized to a single site (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the F14 segment of HS I,II contained a total of three strong Pit-1 binding sites: two within the central F14.3 subfragment and a third in the 5′-most F14.1 subfragment. The potential site within F14.3.2 was not pursued in this analysis due to the very weak Pit-1 binding as compared with the other three sites. The positions of the three Pit-1 sites within the F14 fragment were confirmed by DNase I footprinting. Regions of the F14 fragment protected from DNase I digestion by GH3 nuclear extract corresponded to the single Pit-1 site in F14.1 and the two Pit-1 sites in F14.3 (Fig. 4). Several additional footprints were also seen, as predicted by the presence of non-Pit-1 complexes on the EMSA (Fig. 2 C and data not shown). Thus, the EMSA and footprint analysis were internally consistent in demonstrating an array of three Pit-1 sites in the F14 segment of HS I,II (Fig. 4,bottom). Determinants sufficient to confer high level, position-independent, somatotrope-specific expression of a linked hGH-N gene in transgenic mice have previously been resolved to the F14 segment of HS I,II (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As described above, the pituitary-specific complexes formed on this fragment corresponded to three Pit-1 binding sites. The functional contribution of these Pit-1 sites to LCR function was next tested. We focused on the Pit-1 sites within the F14.3 sequence because they appeared by EMSA to demonstrate the highest binding affinity (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 9; Fig. 2 D, compare lanes 2 and6). The entire F14.3 region was deleted from F14 to test the functional role of these two sites. The ability of the resultant F14Δ.3 to activate hGH-N transgene expression was compared with that of the intact F14 fragment using a previously validated transgenic founder assay (11Bennani-Baiti I.M. Asa S.L. Song D. Iratni R. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10655-10660Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The F14 and F14Δ.3 fragments were each ligated upstream of the genomic DNA fragment containing thehGH-N gene in native orientation. This hGH-N gene contained its own contiguous promoter within 0.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence encompassing two functional Pit-1 sites (22Nelson C. Albert V.R. Elsholtz H.P. Lu L.I.-W. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1988; 239: 1400-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A). Each construct was injected into fertilized oocytes, and reimplanted embryos were harvested at embryonic day 18.5. The transgenic status of each embryo was established by dot-blot analysis of placental DNA. Sagittally sectioned anterior segments of each embryo were fixed. Pituitaries were identified by light microscopy, and the presence of hGH and mGH staining was scored by immunostaining with antibodies specific for hGH or mGH. The immunohistochemical analysis was carried out without prior knowledge of the presence or identity of the corresponding transgene. The results of the immunostains, which could not be rigorously quantified due to the nature of the assay, were grouped into three categories based on the relative intensities of hGH and mGH signals: 1) hGH expression in somatotropes at levels str"

In this report, we present evidence that TFIIF is also required for efficient promoter escape by RNA polymerase II. Our findings argue that TFIIF performs dual roles in this process. We observe (i) that TFIIF suppresses the frequency of abortive transcription by very early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates by increasing their processivity and (ii) that TFIIF cooperates with TFIIH to prevent premature arrest of early elongation intermediates. In addition, our findings argue that two TFIIF functional domains mediate TFIIF action in promoter escape. First, we observe that a TFIIF mutant selectively lacking elongation activity supports TFIIH action in promoter escape, but is defective in suppressing the frequency of abortive transcription by very early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. Second, a TFIIF mutant selectively lacking initiation activity is more active than wild type TFIIF in increasing the processivity of very early elongation intermediates, but is defective in supporting TFIIH action in promoter escape.

Mammalian TFIIF is a heterodimer composed of ∼30 kDa (RAP30) and ∼74 kDa (RAP74) subunits (1Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 161-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence suggests that TFIIF performs multiple functions in transcription initiation. Although TFIIF is not essential for selective binding of RNA polymerase II to promoters, TFIIF functions as an integral component of the preinitiation complex and strongly stabilizes binding of polymerase to TFIID and TFIIB at the promoter (2Conaway R.C.

Although it is presently not known whether TFIIF merely functions as a scaffold for binding of TFIIH to the preinitiation complex or whether TFIIF actively participates in formation of the open complex, evidence suggests that TFIIF interacts with promoter DNA in the preinitiation complex and induces a dramatic conformational change that results in wrapping of DNA for nearly a full turn around RNA polymerase II and may facilitate formation of the open complex (10Coulombe B.

In addition to its role in transcription initiation, TFIIF is also capable of potently activating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II through a direct interaction with the ternary elongation complex. Evidence suggests that TFIIF activates elongation by suppressing transient pausing by polymerase at many sites along the DNA (13Tan S. Aso T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol.

We observed that TFIIF initiation activity is mediated at least in part by RAP30 C-terminal sequences that contain a cryptic DNA-binding domain, which Werner and co-workers (23Groft C.M. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Werner M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9117-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated by NMR is similar in structure to the “winged” helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains of linker histone H5 and hepatocyte nuclear transcription factor HNF3/forkhead (23Groft C.M. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Werner M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9117-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that TFIIF elongation activity is mediated in part by RAP30 sequences located upstream of the C terminus in a region proposed to bind RNA polymerase II. We recently identified post-initiation roles for TFIIE, TFIIH, and an ATP cofactor in efficient promoter escape by RNA polymerase II. Our findings led to the model that TFIIE and TFIIH function together to increase the efficiency of promoter escape by suppressing premature arrest of early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates in an ATP-dependent process that depends on TFIIH DNA helicase activity. Because TFIIF is required for interaction of TFIIH with the preinitiation complex and for open complex formation catalyzed by the TFIIH DNA helicase, we investigated the possibility that TFIIF might also be required for TFIIH action in promoter escape. In this report, we present evidence that TFIIF functions not only in promoter-specific transcription initiation, but also in promoter escape. By analyzing the activities of TFIIF mutants selectively deficient in promoter-specific transcription initiation or in stimulation of elongation by RNA polymerase II, we have obtained evidence that TFIIF performs dual roles in promoter escape, by cooperating with TFIIH to modulate premature arrest of early elongation intermediates, and, in a reaction dependent on TFIIF elongation activity, by increasing the processivity of very early elongation intermediates. Here we present these findings, which bring to light a novel function for TFIIF in promoter escape and support a role for TFIIF elongation activity in this process.

Individual recombinant histidine-tagged Elongin A, B, and C subunits were expressed in E. coli, purified from guanidine hydrochloride-solubilized inclusion bodies by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, and refolded together as described previously (31Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The reconstituted Elongin ABC complex was further purified as described (15Bradsher J.N.

Transcription reactions were performed essentially as described (25Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complexes were assembled at the AdML promoter at 28 °C by a 45-min incubation of 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 55 mm KCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, 6% (v/v) glycerol, 5 units of recombinant placental ribonuclease inhibitor, ∼10 ng of DNA template, ∼5 ng of recombinant yeast TBP, ∼10 ng of recombinant TFIIB, ∼4 ng of TFIIE, 0.01 units of RNA polymerase II, and the amounts of TFIIF, TFIIH, and Elongin ABC complex indicated in the figure legends. Transcription reactions were performed at 28 °C with the concentrations of nucleotides indicated in the figure legends. Transcription reactions measuring synthesis of trinucleotide or 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts were stopped by addition of 15 μl of a solution of 100 mm EDTA and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, 55 μl of a solution of 9m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol FF were added to reaction mixtures. The samples were vortexed for 10 s, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis through 25% (w/v) acrylamide, 3% (w/v) bisacrylamide, 6 m urea gels as described (32Jacob G.A. Luse S.W. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22537-22544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription reactions measuring full-length run-off transcripts were stopped by addition of an equal volume of a solution of 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, transcripts were precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 30 μl of a solution of 9 m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.3% (w/v) bisacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Transcript synthesis was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To begin to investigate the role of TFIIF in promoter escape, we took advantage of the artificial AdML promoter derivative Ad(−9/−1), which contains a premelted transcriptional start site (Fig. 1 A). Ad(−9/−1) can support initiation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (8Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol.

Transcription from the premelted Ad(−9/−1) promoter was reconstituted with RNA polymerase II, TBP, TFIIB, and various combinations of TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH. Transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm of the initiating dinucleotide CpA, which directs transcription initiation at position −1 relative to the normal AdML transcriptional start site, 0.5 μm[α-32P]CTP, 5 μm ATP, 5 μmUTP, and 80 μm of the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide 3′-O-MeGTP, which prevents most transcription beyond the first G residue at position +15 of the nascent transcript. Under our reaction conditions, transcription from the Ad(−9/−1) promoter, with or without TFIIF, was inhibited completely by 1 μg/ml α-amanitin and reduced by at least 90% by omission of either TBP or TFIIB from reactions (data not shown), arguing that it was dependent on RNA polymerase II and primarily promoter-specific. Consistent with results of previous studies indicating that efficient promoter escape depends upon the presence of TFIIE and TFIIH (25Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,36Conaway J.W. Dvir A. Moreland R.J. Yan Q. Elmendorf B.J. Tan S. Conaway R.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the rate of synthesis of full-length 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts was maximal when transcription reactions contained all five general initiation factors (Fig. 1 B, lanes 29–32). Omission of TFIIE, TFIIH, or both factors from transcription reactions resulted in a significantly reduced rate of synthesis of 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts, and a substantially increased rate of appearance of abortive trinucleotide transcripts and abortive or arrested transcripts shorter than ∼9 nucleotides (lanes 5–8, 13–16, 21–24). Omission of TFIIF from transcription reactions resulted in a further reduction in the rate of synthesis of abortive trinucleotide transcripts. In addition, at the low ribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations used in our assays, omission of TFIIF from transcription reactions resulted in a drastic reduction in synthesis of transcripts longer than 3 nucleotides (lanes 1–4, 9–12, 17–20, and25–28), even at times when the levels of trinucleotide synthesized was equal to or greater than the levels of trinucleotide synthesized in the presence of TFIIF (compare lanes 4 and5, 12 and 13, 20 and 21, and28 and 29), arguing that, under the conditions of our assays, TFIIF can increase the processivity of very early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. In a previous study, we identified RAP30 mutations that differentially affect TFIIF initiation and elongation activities (21Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Our findings revealed that TFIIF elongation activity is most strongly sensitive to RAP30 mutations that fall between residues 91 and 135, in a region proposed to bind RNA polymerase II. In contrast, TFIIF initiation activity is most strongly sensitive to RAP30 mutations that fall between residues 136 and 210, in a C-terminal region that includes a cryptic DNA-binding domain. The RAP30 C-terminal DNA-binding domain exhibits limited sequence similarity to conserved region 4 of bacterial ς factors (39Tan S. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Uljon S.N. Wang R. Werner M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9117-9122Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To explore further the role of TFIIF in promoter escape, we compared the activities of two TFIIF mutants, F-RAP30(Δ181–195) and F-RAP30(Δ91–105) (Fig. 2 A), which we previously showed were most severely defective in initiation and elongation, respectively (21Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The TFIIF mutants were purified from the soluble fraction ofE. coli coinfected with M13 vectors encoding RAP74 and either histidine-tagged wild type RAP30, RAP30(Δ181–195), or RAP30(Δ91–105). As shown in Fig. 2 B, following chromatography on consecutive Ni2+-agarose, phosphocellulose, TSK DEAE-NPR, and TSK SP-NPR columns, wild type TFIIF and the two TFIIF mutants were more than 95% pure and contained approximately stoichiometric amounts of RAP30 and RAP74. The initiation activities of purified wild type TFIIF and the TFIIF mutants were compared in dinucleotide-primed abortive initiation assays, which have been widely used to measure synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases (41McClure W.R.

The elongation activities of wild type TFIIF and TFIIF mutants were compared in oligo(dC)-tailed template assays, which allow measurement of the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of transcription factors needed for promoter-specific initiation (46Kadesch T.R. Rosenberg S. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 47Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TFIIF mutant F-RAP30(Δ181–195) supported little or no abortive initiation by RNA polymerase II from the AdML promoter (Fig. 2 C), but stimulated elongation by polymerase in oligo(dC)-tailed template assays with a specific activity 30–50% that of wild type TFIIF. In addition, consistent with our previous results (21Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), TFIIF mutant F-RAP30(Δ91–105) did not detectably stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II, but could support abortive initiation by polymerase from the AdML promoter, although at reduced levels compared with wild type TFIIF. Although the specific activity of F-RAP30(Δ91–105) in abortive initiation was not as great as that of wild type TFIIF, F-RAP30(Δ91–105) was capable of supporting abortive initiation ∼50% as well as wild type TFIIF when present at saturating concentrations. Because F-RAP30(Δ91–105) could support initiation by RNA polymerase II on a duplex DNA template, we tested its activity in promoter escape from a duplex AdML promoter derivative (Fig. 2 C) that directs synthesis of a transcript of the same sequence as Ad(−9/−1). Transcription was reconstituted with RNA polymerase II, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIH, and increasing concentrations of either wild type TFIIF or F-RAP30(Δ91–105). Transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm CpA, 0.2 μm[α-32P]CTP, 5 μm ATP, 5 μmUTP, and 80 μm of the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide 3′-O-MeGTP. As shown in Fig. 3 A, both TFIIF and F-RAP30(Δ91–105) supported synthesis of 16-nucleotide 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts. Comparison of the size distribution of transcripts synthesized in the presence of 10 ng of wild type TFIIF or 10 ng of F-RAP30(Δ91–105) (Fig. 3 B) revealed that a significantly larger fraction of polymerases completed synthesis of 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts in the presence of wild type TFIIF. A quantitative measure of the efficiencies of promoter escape in the presence of wild type or mutant TFIIF was obtained by determining the fraction of transcriptional starts that resulted in synthesis of full-length, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts. As shown in Fig. 3 C, in the presence of wild type TFIIF, the maximal ratio of 16-mer to transcriptional starts was ∼3-fold greater than in the presence of F-RAP30(Δ91–105), suggesting a role for TFIIF elongation activity in increasing the processivity of very early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates. Because the TFIIF mutant F-RAP30(Δ181–195) does not support initiation on duplex DNA templates but does on the premelted Ad(−9/−1) promoter, we used the Ad(−9/−1) promoter to compare its activity in promoter escape to the activities of wild type TFIIF and of the elongation defective mutant F-RAP30(Δ91–105). Transcription was reconstituted in the presence and absence of TFIIH with RNA polymerase II, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and wild type TFIIF, F-RAP30(Δ91–105), or F-RAP30(Δ181–195). As in the previous experiments, transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 200 μm CpA, 0.2 μm [α-32P]CTP, 5 μmATP, 5 μm UTP, and 80 μm3′-O-MeGTP, and a quantitative measure of the efficiencies of promoter escape in the presence of wild type TFIIF or TFIIF mutants was obtained by determining the fraction of transcriptional starts that resulted in synthesis of full-length 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts. Consistent with the results of the experiment of Fig. 3, the ratio of 16-mer to transcriptional starts was ∼3-fold greater in the presence of wild type TFIIF than in the presence of F-RAP30(Δ91–105), in both the presence and absence of TFIIH (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, TFIIH stimulated the efficiency of promoter escape similarly (15–20-fold) in the presence of either wild type TFIIF or F-RAP30(Δ91–105) (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that the relative inactivity of this mutant was not due to defective interaction with TFIIH. Surprisingly, in the absence of TFIIH, the initiation-defective TFIIF mutant F-RAP30(Δ181–195) supported more efficient promoter escape than wild type TFIIF (Fig. 5). In this experiment, reactions were performed in the presence of levels of wild type and mutant TFIIF that supported synthesis of similar levels of transcripts. A larger fraction of early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates suffered abortion or arrest after synthesis of 5–8 nucleotide transcripts in the presence of wild type TFIIF than in the presence of F-RAP30(Δ181–195)."

It is interesting to note that some zinc finger proteins may regulate hematopoietic differentiation toward erythroid (GATA-1 and EKLF), megakaryocytic (GATA-1 and -2), lymphoid (GATA-3 and Ikaros), granulocytic (MZF-1), as well as monocytic (EGR-1) lineages (5Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ting C.N. Olson M.C. Barton K.P. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 384: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 7Hui P. Guo X. Bradford P.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16493-16502Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, many zinc finger genes have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. For example, Cys2/His2 type zinc fingers such as HRX (also named as ALL-1 or MLL) (8Rubnitz J.E. Behm F.G. Downing J.R. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar), PLZF (for promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger gene) (9Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A.

A. 1991; 88: 4367-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) have been implicated in a variety of chromosomal translocations that play a primordial role in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies.This study tries to isolate novel Krüppel-like zinc finger genes expressed in normal bone marrow and promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 as part of a long term effort to explore the molecular regulation of hematopoiesis. Using oligonucleotide primers based on conserved sequences of Krüppel-like gene family to drive homologous PCR1amplification, a large number of DNA fragments corresponding to the zinc finger regions of these genes were obtained. After subcloning and sequencing, novel genes were defined based on data base search and subject to full-length cDNA cloning and functional analysis.DISCUSSIONCys2/His2 type zinc finger gene family is one of the largest gene families, and each member has repeated zinc finger motifs containing finger-like structure by two cysteines and two histidines covalently binding to one zinc ion (18Jacobs G.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11 (0): 4507-4517Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is estimated that in this huge family, about one third of the members areKrüppel-like genes as characterized by the presence of highly conserved connecting sequences “TGEKPYX” between adjacent zinc finger motifs. Substantial evidence indicates thatKrüppel proteins are important players in many physiological processes as transcriptional regulators.Krüppel-like zinc finger genes are key transcriptional repressors in development of Drosophila. In mammalian animal and human, these genes are found involved in embryo development and hematopoiesis. For example, mouse Krox20 gene and both mouse and human PLZF genes have been associated with development of rhombomere in hindbrain (19Cook M. Gould A. Brand N. Davies J. Strutt P. Shaknovich R. Licht J. Waxman S. Chen Z. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Krumlauf R. Zelent A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2249-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Wilkinson D.G. Bhatt S. Chavrier P. Bravo R. Charnay P. Nature. 1989; 337: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). EKLF protein regulates expression of β-globin by binding cis-acting elements to facilitate the switch of hemoglobin from fetal γ-globin to adult β-globin (21Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whereas MZF1 participates in the progression of differentiation toward granulocytic lineage through high affinity binding to promoters of some specific genes expressed in myelocytic lineage such as CD34, transferrin, and myeloperoxidase (23Hromas R. Davis B. Rauscher III, F.J. Klemszm T.D. Hoffman S. Xu D. Morris J.F. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLZF is associated with the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(11;17) chromosomal translocation, while Bcl-6 is one of the key genes involved in large cell lymphoma (9Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 10Galieque Zouitina S. Quief S. Hildebrand M.P. Denis C. Lecocq G. Collyn-d'Hooghe M. Bastard C. Yuille M. Dyer M.J.S. Kerckaert J.P. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 579-587PubMed Google Scholar).The importance of Krüppel-like zinc finger genes in physiological and pathological hematopoietic regulation has prompted us, in the present work, to clone novel members of this family from blood cells of normal and leukemia origins. Since the nucleic acid sequences encoding typical Cys2/His2 motifs and the connecting sequences are well conserved, it was possible to identify new members of this family by homologous RT-PCR amplification/library screening strategy. A large number of homologous sequences, including novel ones, were indeed obtained from bone marrow and NB4 cell line. This approach, together with cDNA library screening, in silico cloning, and RACE, allowed an efficient working system to be established to clone novel zinc finger genes.One important clue to the possible functions of these novel zinc finger genes was their expression pattern. It is interesting to note that ZNF253, ZNF254, ZNF256, and ZNF257 are selectively expressed in certain leukemia cell lines representing different lineages, and thus could be related to the differentiation and maturation of hematopoiesis. In contrast, ZNF191 and ZNF255 show ubiquitous expression in leukemia cell line.Krüppel-like zinc finger family has many subfamilies based on non-zinc finger regions, and these subfamilies play distinct roles in terms of transcriptional regulation of target genes. So far, several domains are found in non-zinc finger regions, such as KRAB, FAX (finger-associated box), POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger), SCAN, FAR (finger-associated repeats), and PR domains (17Williams A.J. Khachigian L.M. Show T. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22143-22152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Knochel W. Poting A. Koster M. Elbaradi T. Nietfeld W.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These domains may affect transcription directly or indirectly. For instance, POZ domain of PLZF may affect transcription by heterodimer formation with SMART, N-coR, or other co-repressor components (28Dong S. Zhu J. Reid A. Struttp P. Guidez F. Zhong H.J. Wang Z.Y. Licht J. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Chen Z. Zelent A. Chen S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Hong S.H. David G. Wong C.W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). There is evidence to show that KRAB domain, present in one third of theKrüppel-like zinc finger genes, functions as transcriptional repressor (30Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen P.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Of note, four out of six genes cloned in the present work contain KRAB domain and the experiments on ZNF253 containing KRAB domain did show transcriptional repressive activities. In view of its wide existence, it is reasonable to suggest that the KRAB domain play an important role in transcription regulation. However, results on the transregulatory properties of other domains from different authors could be controversial. For example, the SCAN domain of human SRE-ZBP protein, a transcription factor, may bind the serum response element of c-fos to down-regulate its expression. However, mouse CTfin-51 protein also containing SCAN domain is a strong transactivator (31Noce T. Fujiwara Y. Sezaki M. Fujimoto H. Higashinakagawa T. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, the SCAN domain from ZNF191 showed no obvious activity in yeast cells but functioned as transrepressor in CHO and NIH3T3 cells. It is possible that the properties of SCAN are determined by gene and/or cell context with distinct transcriptional machineries.A previously undefined domain, named here as KRNB, was discovered in ZNF255. This domain is enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (Gly, Ile, Ala, Leu, and Phe) and negatively charged acidic amino acids (Asp), as commonly found in transcription factors. Therefore, we predicted that ZNF255 might be a transcriptional regulator. Indeed, when this domain was fused with GAL4 BD, it up-regulated the transcriptional expression of reporter gene lacZ in yeast and luciferase in NIH3T3 cells, respectively, although no obvious effect was observed in both CHO and COS-7 cells. It is thus possible that the KRNB functions as a conditional transactivator.Another interesting point is the evolutionary relationship between the six novel genes and other Krüppel-like zinc finger genes. Krüppel-like zinc finger genes may be divided into two types based on their positions through the evolution. Type I such as KRAB and FAX subfamilies seem to appear in late phase of evolution. These genes often aggregated on chromosome as clusters, and their genomic structures are similar, with zinc finger regions encoded by the same sets of exons while non-zinc finger region is encoded by distinct exons (32Huebner K. Druck T. Croce C.M. Thiesen H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 726-740PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work showed that, in humans, more than 40 zinc finger genes aggregated on chromosome 19p13 and more than 10 genes on chromosome 19q13 (33Shannon M. Ashworth L.K. Mucenski M.L. Lamerdin J.E. Branscomb S. Genomics. 1996; 33: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Bellefroid E.J. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Porcelet D.A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA. 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Type II genes such as KROX subfamily are highly conserved among different species and observed during early time of evolution. These genes are usually involved in cell differentiation and morphogenesis and expressed during embryo development. According to the bioinformatics analysis, the six genes obtained in this study all belong to type I subfamilies and show relative late appearance in the phylogenic tree (Fig. 6). Chromosomal localization also supports this conclusion because five of them are aggregated on chromosome 19p13 or 19q13 regions, except for ZNF191, which has been mapped to chromosome 18. The precise functions of these six genes should be further elucidated. Transcriptional regulation is controlled through interaction between DNA and protein complex, the latter containing transcription factors with highly conserved protein motifs. The most well known motifs are the helix-turn-helix, helix-loop-helix, and zinc finger. During cell differentiation and development, each of these domains is involved in the binding of transcription factors to their cognate DNA recognition site, resulting in the specific activation or repression of gene expression (1Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Zinc finger gene family belongs to one of the largest human gene families and plays an important role in the regulation of transcription. This large family may be divided into many subfamilies such as Cys2/His2 type, glucocorticoid receptor, ring finger, GATA-1 type, GAL4 type, and LIM family (2Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3Hammarstrom A. Berndt K.D. Sillard R. Adermann K. Otting G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12723-12732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Barlow P.N. Luisi B. Milner A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In Cys2/His2 type zinc finger genes, there are highly conserved consensus sequence TGEKPYX (Xrepresenting any amino acid) between adjacent zinc finger motifs. The zinc finger proteins containing this specific structure are named afterKrüppel-like zinc finger proteins because the structure was first found in the Drosophila Krüppel protein (1Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Hematopoiesis is a complex physiological process, which requires fine regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis, fetal life and after birth. Disturbance of this regulation, therefore, may be the cause of hematopoietic disorders. It is interesting to note that some zinc finger proteins may regulate hematopoietic differentiation toward erythroid (GATA-1 and EKLF), megakaryocytic (GATA-1 and -2), lymphoid (GATA-3 and Ikaros), granulocytic (MZF-1), as well as monocytic (EGR-1) lineages (5Weiss M.J.

For example, mouse Krox20 gene and both mouse and human PLZF genes have been associated with development of rhombomere in hindbrain (19Cook M. Gould A. Brand N. Davies J. Strutt P. Shaknovich R.

Chavrier P. Bravo R. Charnay P. Nature. 1989; 337: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). EKLF protein regulates expression of β-globin by binding cis-acting elements to facilitate the switch of hemoglobin from fetal γ-globin to adult β-globin (21Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whereas MZF1 participates in the progression of differentiation toward granulocytic lineage through high affinity binding to promoters of some specific genes expressed in myelocytic lineage such as CD34, transferrin, and myeloperoxidase (23Hromas R. Davis B. Rauscher III, F.J. Klemszm T.D. Hoffman S. Xu D. Morris J.F. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PLZF is associated with the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(11;17) chromosomal translocation, while Bcl-6 is one of the key genes involved in large cell lymphoma (9Chen Z. Brand N.J. Chen A. Chen S.J. Tong J.H. Wang Z.Y. Waxman S. Zelent A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 10Galieque Zouitina S. Quief S. Hildebrand M.P. Denis C. Lecocq G. Collyn-d'Hooghe M. Bastard C. Yuille M. Dyer M.J.S. Kerckaert J.P. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 579-587PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of Krüppel-like zinc finger genes in physiological and pathological hematopoietic regulation has prompted us, in the present work, to clone novel members of this family from blood cells of normal and leukemia origins. Since the nucleic acid sequences encoding typical Cys2/His2 motifs and the connecting sequences are well conserved, it was possible to identify new members of this family by homologous RT-PCR amplification/library screening strategy. A large number of homologous sequences, including novel ones, were indeed obtained from bone marrow and NB4 cell line. This approach, together with cDNA library screening, in silico cloning, and RACE, allowed an efficient working system to be established to clone novel zinc finger genes. One important clue to the possible functions of these novel zinc finger genes was their expression pattern. It is interesting to note that ZNF253, ZNF254, ZNF256, and ZNF257 are selectively expressed in certain leukemia cell lines representing different lineages, and thus could be related to the differentiation and maturation of hematopoiesis. In contrast, ZNF191 and ZNF255 show ubiquitous expression in leukemia cell line. Krüppel-like zinc finger family has many subfamilies based on non-zinc finger regions, and these subfamilies play distinct roles in terms of transcriptional regulation of target genes. So far, several domains are found in non-zinc finger regions, such as KRAB, FAX (finger-associated box), POZ (poxvirus and zinc finger), SCAN, FAR (finger-associated repeats), and PR domains (17Williams A.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These domains may affect transcription directly or indirectly. For instance, POZ domain of PLZF may affect transcription by heterodimer formation with SMART, N-coR, or other co-repressor components (28Dong S. Zhu J. Reid A. Struttp P. Guidez F. Zhong H.J. Wang Z.Y. Licht J. Waxman S. Chomienne C. Chen Z. Zelent A. Chen S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3624-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Hong S.H. David G. Wong C.W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). There is evidence to show that KRAB domain, present in one third of theKrüppel-like zinc finger genes, functions as transcriptional repressor (30Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen P.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Of note, four out of six genes cloned in the present work contain KRAB domain and the experiments on ZNF253 containing KRAB domain did show transcriptional repressive activities. In view of its wide existence, it is reasonable to suggest that the KRAB domain play an important role in transcription regulation. However, results on the transregulatory properties of other domains from different authors could be controversial. For example, the SCAN domain of human SRE-ZBP protein, a transcription factor, may bind the serum response element of c-fos to down-regulate its expression. However, mouse CTfin-51 protein also containing SCAN domain is a strong transactivator (31Noce T. Fujiwara Y. Sezaki M. Fujimoto H. Higashinakagawa T. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, the SCAN domain from ZNF191 showed no obvious activity in yeast cells but functioned as transrepressor in CHO and NIH3T3 cells. It is possible that the properties of SCAN are determined by gene and/or cell context with distinct transcriptional machineries. A previously undefined domain, named here as KRNB, was discovered in ZNF255. This domain is enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (Gly, Ile, Ala, Leu, and Phe) and negatively charged acidic amino acids (Asp), as commonly found in transcription factors. Therefore, we predicted that ZNF255 might be a transcriptional regulator. Indeed, when this domain was fused with GAL4 BD, it up-regulated the transcriptional expression of reporter gene lacZ in yeast and luciferase in NIH3T3 cells, respectively, although no obvious effect was observed in both CHO and COS-7 cells. It is thus possible that the KRNB functions as a conditional transactivator. Another interesting point is the evolutionary relationship between the six novel genes and other Krüppel-like zinc finger genes. Krüppel-like zinc finger genes may be divided into two types based on their positions through the evolution. Type I such as KRAB and FAX subfamilies seem to appear in late phase of evolution. These genes often aggregated on chromosome as clusters, and their genomic structures are similar, with zinc finger regions encoded by the same sets of exons while non-zinc finger region is encoded by distinct exons (32Huebner K. Druck T. Croce C.M. Thiesen H.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 726-740PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work showed that, in humans, more than 40 zinc finger genes aggregated on chromosome 19p13 and more than 10 genes on chromosome 19q13 (33Shannon M. Ashworth L.K. Mucenski M.L. Lamerdin J.E. Branscomb S. Genomics. 1996; 33: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Bellefroid E.J. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Porcelet D.A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA. 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Type II genes such as KROX subfamily are highly conserved among different species and observed during early time of evolution. These genes are usually involved in cell differentiation and morphogenesis and expressed during embryo development. According to the bioinformatics analysis, the six genes obtained in this study all belong to type I subfamilies and show relative late appearance in the phylogenic tree (Fig. 6). Chromosomal localization also supports this conclusion because five of them are aggregated on chromosome 19p13 or 19q13 regions, except for ZNF191, which has been mapped to chromosome 18. The precise functions of these six genes should be further elucidated. We are grateful to all members of the Shanghai Institute of Hematology for their excellent technical assistance and encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W2077514762,"Recent studies suggest that the mobility of clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface are restricted by an actin cytoskeleton and that there is an obligate reduction in the amount of spectrin on membranes during coated pit budding. The spectrin-actin cytoskeleton associates with membranes primarily through ankyrins, which interact with the cytoplasmic region of numerous integral membrane proteins. We now report that the fourth repeat domain (D4) of ankyrinR binds to the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain with high affinity. Addition of peptides containing the D4 region inhibited clathrin-coated pit budding in vitro. In addition, microinjection of D4 containing peptides blocked the endocytosis of fluorescent low density lipoprotein (LDL). AnkyrinR peptides that contained repeat domains other than D4 had no effect on either in vitro budding or internalization of LDL. Finally, immunofluorescence shows that ankyrin is uniformly associated with endosomes that contain fluorescent LDL. These results suggest that ankyrin plays a role in the budding of clathrin-coated pits during endocytosis.

Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The decline in spectrin depends on the ability of annexin VI to bind spectrin and activate a calpain-like protease. When cells are grown in the presence of calpain inhibitor I (ALLN), annexin VI-dependent budding of clathrin-coated pits is arrested. The cells compensate by assembling a new population of coated pits that can bud in the absence of annexin VI and no longer require spectrin removal. The endosomes that form from these pits, however, have a distinctly different trafficking pattern in the cell. The spectrin-actin cytoskeleton lines the cytoplasmic surface of a variety of cellular membranes including the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, plasma membrane, and an unknown vesicular structure (2Devarajan P.

At the plasma membrane, this cytoskeleton can control membrane topology, elasticity, and membrane protein composition (5Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar, 6Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1263-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Products of the three ankyrin genes (ankyrinR, B,G) provide the primary linkage between spectrin-actin networks and the plasma membrane. Ankyrins mediate this linkage through binding sites for both the β-subunit of spectrin and the cytoplasmic domains of several membrane proteins. Binding sites for these membrane proteins are largely localized to the membrane-binding domain at the N terminus of ankyrins. This highly conserved region of ankyrin is dominated by 24 tandem copies of a 33-amino acid motif that is commonly termed ANK repeats or ankyrin repeats (7Lux S.E. John K.M. Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F.

Ankyrin repeats are a well characterized motif that provides sites of protein-protein interaction in numerous proteins (10Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Nonankyrin molecules that contain ankyrin repeats typically have 4–7 tandem copies, and tandem arrays of repeats have been shown to fold cooperatively into stable structures (11Batchelor A.H. Piper D.E. de la Brousse F.C. McKnight S.L. Wolberger C. Science. 1998; 279: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The 24 tandem repeats found in ankyrins assemble into four folding domains of six repeats each (13Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are believed to associate with the cytoplasmic domains of at least seven unrelated membrane proteins (5Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar). The binding sites for two of these membrane proteins, neurofascin and the anion exchanger, have been localized on the repeat domains. Surprisingly, both membrane proteins interact with ankyrin at discrete, noncompeting sites that require both repeat domains 3 and 4 (13Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol.

During a screen to identify new ankyrin-binding proteins, we discovered that the D4 region of ankyrinR binds with high affinity to the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Because of the role of spectrin in coated pit budding, we tested peptides containing D4 and found that they specifically block annexin VI-dependent budding in vitro and prevent the uptake of LDL when microinjected into cells.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 3.5–17% exponential gradient gels using the Fairbanks buffer system (17Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar). Ankyrin repeat peptides were expressed from cDNAs derived from the ankyrinR gene using a T7 expression vector. Protein constructs were purified from expressing bacteria by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography as detailed elsewhere (13Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22703-22709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated annexin VI AnxVIΔ192 was prepared as described previously (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The D4 peptide corresponds to a chymotryptic product of ankyrinR and encompasses amino acids 588–827. The D4 affinity column was made by covalently coupling 100 mg of D4 to 20 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SV40 transformed human fibroblasts (designated SV589 cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. 12 adult rat brains (25 g) were homogenized in 100 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 320 mmsucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, and protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 900 × g. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant from this spin was designated as cytosol. The membrane pellet was washed in lysis buffer and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min. Membranes were resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer followed by the addition of 100 ml of ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer (5% v/v Triton X-100, 0.2% phosphatidylcholine, 200 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 4 mm DTT, 1 mmNaN3, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. The solution was then centrifuged for 45 min on ice at 100,000 ×g to remove insoluble material. The D4 column was loaded three times with the Triton X-100 extract and washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (2.5% v/v Triton X-100 0.02% phosphatidylcholine, 100 mmKCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm NaN3). Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (wash buffer plus 1 m NaBr). Peak fractions (30 ml) containing the 170 kDa band (clathrin heavy chain) were pooled, dialyzed against column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmNaN3) overnight, loaded on a MonoQ column, and eluted with a 0–500 mm NaBr gradient in column buffer. The peak fractions (6 ml) were pooled and used for the binding assays detailed below. Latex beads were coated with ankyrin peptides as described previously (18Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The beads were then resuspended in assay buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm NaN3, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mg/ml BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20. D4 affinity purified clathrin was labeled with 125I using the Bolton-Hunter method. Affinities were measured by incubating increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled clathrin with ankyrin peptide derivitized beads in assay buffer for 3 h on ice.125I-Labeled clathrin bound to the beads was separated from unbound by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min) through a cushion of 10% sucrose in assay buffer. Both bound and unbound fractions were counted and used to calculate saturation and Scatchard plots. Nonspecific associations were assessed by raising the concentration of NaCl to 500 mm in parallel assays. Nonspecific interactions represented less than 10% total binding and have been subtracted from the data presented. All measured values are the means of triplicate experiments with a standard deviation <5%. Clathrin-coated pit budding and spectrin removal were assayed in vitro as described previously (19Lin H.C. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, SV589 fibroblasts grown as described previously (20Moore M.S. Mahaffey D.T. Brodsky F.M. Anderson R.G.W. Science. 1987; 263: 558-563Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips by centrifugation (1800 × g for 10 min) followed by incubation with ice-cold Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 2% crystalline BSA for 1 h. The coverslips were then washed quickly with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl) and buffer B (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 mm DTT) and finally sonicated in buffer B on ice. The attached plasma membranes were washed three times with ice-cold buffer B. Budding was initiated by shifting to 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of budding mixture (buffer B with 1 mg/ml inactivated bovine brain cytosol, 1 mm ATP, 150 μm CaCl2, and 1 nm annexin VI) and the indicated concentration of ankyrin peptide. The membranes were then washed three times with ice-cold buffer B, fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in buffer B without DTT, and washed three times with buffer C (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2). Coated pit budding was measured as the amount of clathrin lost from the membrane as determined using a radioimmune assay (RIA). Spectrin loss was also assessed by RIA. RIAs were performed using mAb against either clathrin or spectrin, a biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG, and125I-streptavidin as described previously (19Lin H.C. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RIAs for clathrin and spectrin were also performed on membranes that were only washed and fixed. The counts from these RIAs were taken to be total starting values. The percentage of clathrin or spectrin loss is calculated as the ratio of scintillation counts from each experiment to the total starting values. SV589 fibroblasts were plated on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and grown overnight. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% lipoprotein-depleted human serum (HLPPS), and the cells were grown for 48 h. LDL uptake was initiated by incubating cells in HLPPS medium containing 20 μg/ml PMCA-LDL at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 30 min. The coverslips were then washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS on ice for 15 min, washed four times with PBS, and mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount. SV589 fibroblasts were plated on coverslips as described above for the LDL uptake assay. The truncated annexin VI, AnxVIΔ192 (the first 192 residues of annexin VI) and ankyrin peptides D12 and D34 were dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. The protein solutions were then diluted with buffer to 20 μm and combined with 20 mg/ml FITC-dextran to a final concentration of 10 μm protein and 10 mg/ml dextran. The solutions were then spun at 100,000 × gfor 30 min to remove any aggregates and microinjected into SV589 cells using an eppindorf micromanipulator microinjection system. The results shown are cells representative of three separate microinjection experiments where at least 20 cells were examined per experiment. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed on ice for 15 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed four times with PBS, permeabilized for 5 min on ice with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed four times with PBS, and blocked by incubating for 30 min with 1% BSA in PBS. The primary antibody, a mAb directed against the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrinB was used as an ascites fluid diluted 1:100 into 1% BSA in PBS. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed with wash buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS) three times, once for 15 min and twice for 5 min. Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was diluted to 4 μg/ml in 1% BSA in PBS and incubated with the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed with washed as above. Coverslips were mounted using Aqua Poly/Mount and viewed with a Zeiss Photomicroscope III. The images shown are representative of the results obtained in five separate trials. In an effort to identify novel ankyrin-binding proteins, we screened for proteins that could associate with an affinity column made from the fourth repeat domain (D4) of the membrane-binding domain of ankyrinR. The D4 affinity column was constructed using a recombinant peptide that encompasses amino acids 588–827 of ankyrinR. This region corresponds to a chymotryptic fragment of the membrane-binding domain of ankyrinR that contains repeats 19–24 as well as some flanking sequences. A Triton X-100 extract of rat brain membranes was passed over the D4 column (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2), after which the column was extensively washed and eluted with a buffer containing 1 mNaBr (lane 3). Coomassie Blue staining showed that the eluate contained a prominent 170-kDa band along with several minor proteins, including a doublet of 30–35 kDa. A protein of similar molecular mass was retained on the D4 affinity column when cytosol was loaded in place of the Triton X-100 extract (lane 6). Further purification of the 170-kDa protein by MonoQ ion exchange removed most contaminating bands from the Triton X-100 eluate with the exception of the 30–35-kDa doublet (lane 7). The identity of the 170-kDa protein was determined by microsequencing of proteolytic products. Chymotryptic proteolysis of the 170-kDa band generated two major products of 120 and 60 kDa. The 170- and 60-kDa proteins appeared to have blocked N termini; however, the 120-kDa product had an N-terminal sequence identical to an internal sequence of rat clathrin heavy chain (microsequencing data not shown). The 170-kDa protein was recognized by a clathrin-specific polyclonal antibody in immunoblots and displayed a typical triskelion appearance in rotary shadowing electron microscopic images (data not shown). The observed doublet of 30–35 kDa that co-eluted with the 170-kDa band (Fig. 1,lane 7) may correspond to the two light chains of the clathrin triskelion, which have apparent molecular masses of 33 and 36 kDa (21Ungewickell E. Branton D. Nature. 1981; 289: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that clathrin heavy chain can be cleaved by proteolysis into two functionally distinct domains: a 120-kDa C-terminal region, which forms the polygonal lattice in clathrin coats, and a 60-kDa N-terminal domain that extends from the lattice toward the membrane and interacts with AP2 (22Vigers G.P. Crowther R.A. Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), β-arrestin (23Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), and the NPXY sequence of the LDL receptor (24Kibbey R.G. Rizo J. Gierasch L.M. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine which of these two regions contained the binding site for D4, D4 affinity purified clathrin was digested with V8 Staphylococcusprotease at a 1:320 mass ratio for 16 h on ice, after which the proteolytic reaction was stopped with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. We then loaded the digest on a D4 affinity column (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2), washed the column, and eluted with 1 m NaBr (lane 3). A 60-kDa product alone was specifically retained on the column, suggesting that the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain contains the binding site for D4. The clathrin-binding site on ankyrinR was further characterized by examining the ability of 125I-labeled, D4 affinity purified clathrin to associate with repeat domains immobilized on latex beads. Fig. 3 shows that125I-clathrin bound with high affinity to domain 2 (D2), domain 4 (D4), and a peptide containing both domains 3 and 4 (D34). Scatchard plot analysis of these three interactions indicated binding affinities of 1, 12, and 5 nm, respectively (Fig. 3,B and C). Surprisingly, 125I-clathrin did not associate with peptides D12 (containing domains 1 and 2) or D23 (containing domains 2 and 3). The possibility that D12 or D23 are unfolded or inactivated by the assay system is unlikely because neurofascin and the anion exchanger, which also associate with D2, can interact with D12 and D23 peptides in the same assay system (14Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22050-22057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,18Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31298-31302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previous work suggests that the spectrin cytoskeleton may be involved in annexin VI-dependent coated pit budding. Spectrin is removed from immobilized plasma membranes concomitant with clathrin-coated pit budding, and the presence of either an anti-spectrin IgG or the actin-binding domain of spectrin in the assay blocks annexin VI-dependent coated pit budding (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because spectrin binds to ankyrin (25Bennett V. Nature. 1979; 281: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the D4 region of ankyrin binds to clathrin (Fig. 3), we tested whether D4 affected coated pit budding using a radioimmune assay that measures the amount of clathrin on immobilized plasma membrane (Fig. 4). In this assay, addition of cytosol, ATP, and Ca2+ at 37 °C causes about a 25% decline in the amount of clathrin on immobilized fibroblast membranes. An additional 40–45% of the coated pits bud when annexin VI is present in the budding reaction (19Lin H.C. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The presence of increasing amounts of either D4 (Fig. 4 A, ■) or D34 (Fig. 4 A, ▪) in the budding assays containing cytosol, ATP, Ca2+, and annexin VI caused a progressive reduction in the amount of clathrin lost. Inhibition plateaued at ∼25% loss with a half-maximal inhibition occurring at 30 and 20 nm, respectively. D4 (Fig. 4 B, ■) and D34 (▪) also blocked spectrin removal with half-maximal inhibition at 15 and 10 nm, respectively. By contrast, addition of up to 320 nm of D3 (○) or D12 (●) had no effect on either clathrin loss (A) or spectrin removal (B). D2 and D23 could not be tested in this assay because they were not soluble in low salt buffers. ALLN, a short peptide that inhibits cysteine proteases, blocks annexin VI-dependent clathrin-coated pit budding both in vivo and in vitro. Fibroblasts treated with ALLN for at least 30 min assemble a new population of coated pits that bud independently of annexin VI (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of D4 on annexin VI-dependent and independent budding using membranes prepared from fibroblasts treated without or with ALLN for 1 h, respectively (Fig. 4). The addition of 50 nm D4 or D34 to the budding assay caused greater than 50% inhibition of both clathrin loss and spectrin removal from membranes of untreated fibroblasts (Fig. 4, C and D, solid bars). By contrast, the addition of these same peptides had no effect on clathrin loss from membranes of fibroblasts that had been treated with ALLN for 1 h (Fig. 4 C, gray bars). As shown previously (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), coated pit budding from membranes of ALLN-treated fibroblasts was not accompanied by spectrin removal (Fig. 4 D, compare solid bars with gray bars). Peptides D3 and D12, which did not bind clathrin, had no effect on clathrin loss or spectrin removal from membranes isolated from either treated (gray bars) or untreated cells (solid bars). These findings suggest that the D4 region specifically blocked annexin VI-dependent coated pit budding. Previously we identified a dominate-negative acting annexin VI (AnxVIΔ192) corresponding to the first 192 amino acids of the protein that inhibited coated pit budding in vitro (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Microinjection of this peptide into fibroblasts markedly reduced the internalization of fluorescent LDL. We used microinjection to see whether peptides containing the D4 repeat would also inhibit LDL uptake (Fig. 5). A buffer containing 10 mg/ml FITC-labeled dextran, either with no additions (Buffer) or with 10 μm peptide D12 (D12), D34 (D34) or peptide AnxVIΔ192 (Δ192) added, was microinjected into SV589. Cells were allowed to recover for 30 min before 20 μg/ml PMCA-LDL was added, and the cells were further incubated for 30 min in HLPPS. The FITC-labeled cells were picked out, and the amount of PMCA-LDL internalized was compared with surrounding noninjected cells. The uptake of PMCA-LDL by cells injected with the D12 peptide was normal (D12) and did not differ from cells that received buffer alone (Buffer). As shown previously (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), uptake of LDL in cells injected with AnxVIΔ192 was markedly inhibited (Δ192). The D34 peptide (D34) was nearly as effective as AnxVIΔ192 at inhibiting LDL internalization. Because both the in vitro and in vivo assays for coated pit budding indicated a function for the ankyrin repeat domain, we used immunofluorescence to determine whether ankyrin was associated with any membranes in the endocytic pathway. Cells that had been grown in the absence of lipoproteins were incubated in the presence of fluorescent LDL for 30 min before fixation and processing for immunofluorescence using an antibody that recognizes the spectrin-binding domain of ankyrinB (Fig. 6). The mAb ankyrin had a punctate staining pattern in the cytoplasm of the cell in addition to staining on the margins of the cell (Ankyrin). PMCA-LDL was seen in numerous vesicular structures (PMCA-LDL). A comparison of the two images (arrows) showed that nearly all of the vesicular structures containing fluorescent LDL were positive for ankyrin. This study provides the first evidence that ankyrins can associate directly with clathrin and participate in annexin VI-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain contained the binding site for ankyrin. The membrane-binding domain of ankyrinR contained two binding sites for clathrin: a site on the second repeat domain (D2) and a site on the fourth repeat domain (D4). The functional significance of the site on D2 is unclear because clathrin was unable to bind peptides containing D2 in combination with either D1 (D12) or D3 (D23). The inability of clathrin to associate with D12 or D23 suggests that D1 and D3 may sterically hinder the ability of clathrin to associate with D2. By contrast, domain 3 (D3) may strengthen the clathrin association with D4 because the binding of clathrin to D34 had a 2-fold higher affinity than to D4 alone. The D4 and D34 peptides inhibited budding from membranes prepared from untreated but not ALLN-treated fibroblasts. One possibility is that D4 competes with an endogenous ankyrin that normally must bind to clathrin during annexin VI-dependent, coated pit budding. This would explain why LDL uptake in vivo was inhibited by microinjected D34 peptides and endosomes containing fluorescent LDL are positive for ankyrin. Coated pits are found in regions of the membrane rich in membrane cytoskeletal elements (26Rodman J.S. Mooseker M. Farquhar M.G. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1986; 42: 319-327PubMed Google Scholar, 27Karlsson U. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1967; 17: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Conradi S. Skoglund S. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1969; 333: 53-76PubMed Google Scholar), and rapid-freeze, deep-etch electron microscopy shows actin-like filaments near clathrin lattices (29Heuser J. Evans L. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 84: 560-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recent studies using clathrin tagged with green fluorescent protein indicate that the mobility of coated pits is restricted by an actin cytoskeleton (30Gaidarov I. Santini F. Warren R.A. Keen J.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This suggests there is a functional linkage between coated pits and the cytoskeleton and annexin VI functions to disconnect this linkage during budding. Ankyrin D4 peptides most likely block budding by preventing the release of spectrin from the membrane. Exactly how an interaction between ankyrin and clathrin regulates annexin VI-dependent release of spectrin remains to be determined. We were unable to detect ankyrin in coated pits, although isolated brain-coated vesicles were positive for ankyrin (data not shown). Nevertheless, nearly every endosome that contained fluorescent LDL also was positive for ankyrin. It is possible that ankyrin binding to clathrin delivers ankyrin to endosomes during the final phases of the budding step. We may not have detected ankyrin in coated pits by immunofluorescence because only specific isoforms interact with clathrin, the reactive epitope in ankyrin was masked, or the association of ankyrin with clathrin is regulated. The C-terminal portion of ankyrin is highly variable among its various isoforms, and this region appears to control both the localization and binding specificity of individual ankyrin isoforms. We have tested whether the two most prevalent ankyrin isoforms in erythrocytes (band 2.1 and 2.2) can associate with clathrin, and neither displays clathrin binding activity (data not shown). Several additional ankyrin gene products are potential candidates for an in vivo association with clathrin. AnkyrinG119 contains the D34 region but only a 5-kDa regulatory domain, suggesting that this C-terminal region may not regulate the binding activities of this ankyrin (2Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). AnkyrinG480 contains a complete membrane-binding domain and a very large C-terminal region (9Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, indirect immunofluorescence has co-localized ankyrinG480 with amphiphysin II at axonal initial segments and nodes of Ranvier, which are rich in clathrin-coated pits (9Kordeli E. Lambert S. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2352-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 27Karlsson U. J. Ultrastruct.

Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Additional ankyrins may associate with clathrin as a result of specific regulatory events. A variety of kinases can modulate the binding activity of ankyrins by phosphorylation (5Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic processing may also play a role because the C-terminal region is highly sensitive to proteolysis and a calpain-like protease is required for annexin VI-dependent clathrin-coated pit budding in fibroblasts (1Kamal A. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Future work will examine which ankyrin isoform is the in vivo partner for clathrin.

Using 25 analogs substituted at a single position by an alanine residue, we performed the complete mapping of the BgK binding sites for the three Kv1 channels. These binding sites included three common residues (Ser-23, Lys-25, and Tyr-26) and a variable set of additional residues depending on the particular channel. Shortening the side chain of Lys-25 by taking out the four methylene groups dramatically decreased the BgK affinity to all Kv1 channels tested. However, the analog K25Orn displayed increased potency on Kv1.2, which makes this peptide a selective blocker for Kv1.2 (K D 50- and 300-fold lower than for Kv1.1 and Kv1.3, respectively). BgK analogs with enhanced selectivity could also be made by substituting residues that are differentially involved in the binding to some of the three Kv1 channels. For example, the analog F6A was found to be >500-fold more potent for Kv1.1 than for Kv1.2 and Kv1.3.

These blockers have proved to be useful tools to understand the relationships between potassium currents and potassium channels. Furthermore, they have brought new insights into the structure of the pore-forming region of these channels (14Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C.

Finally, in brain, the different subtypes of Kv1 channels have been shown to co-assemble into heteromultimers, and the use of radiolabeled blockers has been essential for studying the molecular composition of these channels (21Shamotienko O.G. Parcej D.P. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8195-8201Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Koch R.O. Wanner S.G. Koschak A. Hanner M. Schwarzer C. Kaczorowski G.J. Slaughter R.S.

The peptidic blockers have a variable range of specificities, but none of them appears to be strictly selective toward the different Kv1.1–Kv1.7 channel subtypes. For instance, the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin blocks with dissociation constants in the nanomolar range both Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 but not Kv1.1, even at 1 μmconcentration, whereas the snake venom toxin α-dendrotoxin (αDTX)1 blocks Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 with dissociation constants equal to 20, 17, and 250 nm respectively (24Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). However, potent blockers endowed with high selectivity toward desired channels would be of great interest. For example, homomeric Kv1.3 channels in T-lymphocytes are being considered as a therapeutic target for immunosuppression, and a selective blocker of Kv1.3 could become an interesting immunosuppressant (25Chandy K.G.

The use of more selective blockers would bring further insights in identification of the molecular composition of the native heteromultimerics Kv1 channels. In this respect, it would be particularly interesting to study the Kv1.1 containing channels because they are involved in episodic ataxia (28Browne D.L. Gancher S.T. Nutt J.G. Brunt E.R.P. Smith E.A. Kramer P. Litt M. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and Kv1.1-deleted mice display frequent spontaneous seizures (29Smart S.L. Lopantsev V. Zhang C.L.

One way to design a blocker that would be selective for one subtype of Kv1 channel may consist of modifying the pharmacological profile of a natural blocker and altering its selectivity for Kv1 subtypes, as suggested previously (27Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, the first requirement in such a strategy is to elucidate, as precisely as possible, all the topographies by which a selected blocker binds to the different channel subtypes that are associated with its own pharmacological profile. Although various animal toxins have been previously submitted to extensive mutational studies, no such a complete mapping has been reported for a single toxin against a number of K+channels. We approached this question with BgK, a 37-amino acid peptide, isolated from the sea anemone Bunodosoma granulifera (7Aneiros A. Garcia I. Martinez J.R. Harvey A.L. Anderson A.J. Marshall D.L. Engström Å. Hellman U. Karlsson E. Biochim. Biophys.

Using alanine scanning, the binding determinants of BgK to heteromeric αDTX targets in rat brain that mainly contain Kv1.2 (31Scott V.E.S. Muniz Z.M. Sewing S. Lichtinghagen R. Parcej D. Pongs O.

In the present study, we reported the complete mapping of the binding sites of BgK to homomeric Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channels.

The deduced size of these binding sites increases in the order Kv1.1 < Kv1.2 < Kv1.3. In addition, we showed that some introduced substitutions already confer the toxin with substantially higher selectivity for some channels, offering an experimental basis for designing, in the future, BgK analogs with predetermined selectivity toward the different Kv1. All the analogs in which one residue was substituted by an alanine were synthesized as described previously by Dauplais et al. (32Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B.

HEK-293 cells stably transfected with human Kv1.1 (hKv1.1) cDNA were kindly provided by O. Pongs (Zentrum für Molekulare Neurobiologie, Universität Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany). B82 cells stably transfected with rat Kv1.2 (rKv1.2) cDNA were kindly provided by S. Grissmer (Department of Applied Physiology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). Cells were maintained in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (HEK-293 cells, BioMedia) or a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (B82 cells, Life Technologies, Inc.) culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin (Biowitthaker), 4 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 mg/ml geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. HEK-293 cells were plated onto Nunc dishes and allowed to grow for 3 days before electrophysiological experiments. B82 cells were plated onto glass coverslips for 2 h at 37 °C before being used. Rat Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 cDNAs and subsequent cRNAs (stored in water at 1 μg/ml) were a generous gift from S. Alper (Beth Israël Hospital, Havard Medical School, Boston MA). cRNAs injections in oocytes were done at 4 ng/ml (50 nl injected), and the currents were recorded 1–6 days after injection. Patch pipettes were filled with 130 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.35. Cells were bathed in 137 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. BgK and analogs were diluted in this medium on the day of experiment. Stock solutions (10 μm) were stored in water at −20 °C. Drugs and toxins were applied with a pneumatic Pico-Pump system (WPI) or with a bath application by gravity from several reservoirs connected to a short common outlet. Liquids in excess in the bath were constantly sucked. Holding potential was set at −80 mV for HEK-293 cells and −60 mV for B82 cells. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 1–6 days after cRNAs injection, using a Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were bathed in a calcium-free saline containing: 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm Na2CO3, 10 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. Intracellular electrodes were filled with 3m KCl. The electrode resistance was <1 MΩ. The holding potential was set at −80 mV. The perfusion system was built in order to ensure a fast change in toxin concentration as described previously (30Cotton J. Crest M. Bouet F. Alessandri N. Gola M. Forest E. Karlsson E. Castañeda O. Harvey A.L. Vita C. Ménez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Data obtained from HEK-293 cells and oocytes were sampled at 2 kHz. Software for stimulation, acquisition and analysis was written by H. Chagneux (CNRS UPR 9024). Data from B82 cells were sampled at 3 kHz. Voltage commands, data acquisition, and analysis were carried out by the whole cell analysis program from Dr. J. Dempster (Strathclyde University). The dose-response curves were determined in a nonadditive way with various toxin concentrations separated by wash periods. Each point was the mean ± S.E. of 3–8 experiments. Experimental points were fitted to the theoretical curve y = 1/(1 + ([T] n /IC50) n ), in which y is the fraction of unblocked current, [T] is the concentration of toxin, IC50 is the concentration of toxin inducing 50% of blockade, and n is the Hill coefficient corresponding to the number of molecules of toxin required to block one channel. For each mutant, IC50 was determined without constraint onn. When n ≈ 1, as previously determined for the BgK blockade of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 (30Cotton J. Crest M. Bouet F. Alessandri N. Gola M. Forest E. Karlsson E. Castañeda O. Harvey A.L. Vita C. Ménez A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), IC50gave the apparent dissociation constant K D . Kv1.1 currents were recorded from HEK-293 cells expressing hKv1.1 and from Xenopus oocytes injected with rKv1.1 cRNA. Upon depolarization, the current activated with a sigmoidal time course and was almost devoid of inactivation (Fig. 1, A and B). The voltage dependence was conventionally determined by calculating the peak conductance at various potentials and by fitting the resulting normalized curve to Boltzmann functions. The current reversal potential was evaluated from the tail current kinetic upon repolarization and set at −80 mV. Mean values of V½ (voltage corresponding to half-conductance activation) and p (Boltzmann coefficient) were V½ = −22 ± 1 mV andp = 11 ± 2 mV (n = 18) for hKv1.1 expressed in HEK-293. These values are in good agreement with those obtained for rKv1.1 in Xenopus oocytes, V½ = −32 ± 5 mV and p = 9 ± 3 mV. The 10 mV positive shift in V½observed in HEK-293 as compared with oocytes may be accounted for the junction potential, which results from the low ionic strength of the saline used in patch electrodes (33Gola M. Niel J.P. J. Physiol. 1993; 460: 327-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The blocking potency of BgK on hKv1.1 (Fig. 1 A) and rKv1.1 (Fig. 1 B) was determined by step increasing the BgK concentration from 0.1 to 200 nm (Fig. 1 C). At each concentration and in the −40 to 0 mV range, the blocking potency slightly increased with the pulse level (Fig. 1 D). The voltage dependence was particularly obvious with rKv1.1. Therefore, the K+ current persisting in the presence of BgK was measured between +20 and +40 mV. Experimental points were fitted to hyperbolic curves. For hKv1.1 in HEK-293, we found an IC50 = 30 ± 5 nm, and a Hill coefficient of n = 0.97 ± 0.4 (Fig. 1 C). The corresponding values for rKv1.1 in Xenopus oocyte were IC50 = 0.72 ± 0.06 nm and n = 0.92 ± 0.09 (Fig. 1 C). The Hill coefficient was not significantly different from 1, which confirmed that the BgK action follows a bimolecular mechanism. Therefore, the above IC50 values were considered to reflect the apparent dissociation constantK D . In order to define the residues of BgK that bind to Kv1 channels, we synthesized analogs corresponding to the alanine substitution of all the residues with the exception of the six half-cysteines, four alanines, and one glycine (32Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Meideros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4302-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Among the 26 analogs, D4A could not be properly oxidized. A similar observation has already been mentionned for ShK (D5A analog) (34Pennington M.W. Mahnir V.M. Khaytin I. Zaydenberg I. Byrnes M.E. Kem W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16407-16411Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that this aspartic acid, conserved in all the Kv1 channels blockers from sea anemone, may be important for their folding pathway. In preliminary experiments, the relative affinity of the 25 alanine-monosubstituted analogs was determined as the percentage (mean ± S.E. of 3–7 experiments) of hKv1.1 current blocked by a 50 nm concentration of each peptide. In the case of BgK, this concentration blocks 62% of the current. The mutants were classified in two groups, including, respectively, peptides that induced a percentage of block higher (Fig. 2 A, white columns) or lower (black column) than 25%, a value corresponding to an estimated 5-fold increase in K D (Fig. 2 A, right axis). In order to precisely determine the K D values for the nine analogs of which the affinity was shifted by more than 5-fold, we performed a series of dose-response experiments. We also considered the substitution F6A because this residue was shown to participate in the binding of BgK to rat brain Kv channels (32Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Meideros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4302-4309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The experimental points (mean ± S.E., 4–6 experiments) were fitted to hyperbolic curves with a Hill coefficient, n, set to 1, because no change in the stoechiometry of the binding was observed for all the analogs. To illustrate this point, the Fig. 3 A shows the results for N19A, K25A, and Y26A, for which n = 0.95 ± 0.07, 1.02 ± 0.03, and 1.09 ± 0.1, respectively. The results from dose-response experiments are given in Fig. 2 B. The three most important residues for BgK binding to hKv1.1 are Lys-25, the alanine substitution of which induced an affinity decrease of 60-fold, and Asn-19 and Tyr-26, the substitution of which induced an affinity decrease of 20-fold. In addition, alanine substitution of Ser-23, Gln-24, and Asn-29 induced a moderate, 5–20-fold affinity decrease. Analogs F6A, K7A, S16A, N19A, T22A, S23A, Q24A, K25A, Y26A, R27A, and N29A were also tested for their ability to block the rKv1.1 currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The K D values were determined as described above from dose-response experiments. Fig. 3 B shows that the relative changes in toxin affinity are similar to those observed in HEK-293 transfected cells. However, as observed with native BgK, the K D value of all the analogs subjected to dose-response experiments was systematically smaller for Kv1.1 expressed in oocytes than in HEK-293 cells. The K D ratio between the two expression systems was almost constant: K D (hKv1.1)= (45 ± 6) × K D (rKv1.1) (see legend of Fig. 3 B). Such a difference may result from differences in species of cDNA (human versus rat) or in expression system (mammalian cell line versus oocyte) used. The sequences of the rat and human Kv1.1 cDNAs are identical between the second and the sixth transmembrane segments, and the binding sites of various sea anemone and scorpion toxins have been identified between the fifth and the sixth transmembrane segment of Kv1 channels (14Goldstein S.A.N.

Variation in the affinity of charybdotoxin, αDTX and 4-aminopyridine for Kv channels has been observed depending on the expression system used, either in mammalian cell lines or inXenopus oocytes (1Chandy K.G.

Moreover, the expression of the rat Kv1.2 cDNA in the B82 cells instead ofXenopus oocytes increased by 28-fold theK D of the BgK (see the following section). These data suggest that depending on the expression system, endogenous molecules located around the channels may modify the affinity of blockers and account for the ratioK D (hKv1.1)/K D (rKv1.1). In conclusion, irrespective of the expression system used, three residues (Asn-19, Lys-25, and Tyr-26) appear to be important for BgK binding to Kv1.1, and three others (Ser-23, Gln-24, and Asn-29) appear to contribute more moderately to this binding. BgK and the 25 analogs were tested on rKv1.2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and B82 cells. The dissociation constant of BgK was 1.3 ± 0.4 nm in oocytes and 37 ± 5 nm in B82 cells. Preliminary experiments highlighted a group of six residues (Phe-6, Arg-12, His-13, Ser-23, Lys-25, and Tyr-26), the substitution of which increased theK D by >5-fold (Fig. 4 A). The corresponding analogs were subjected to dose-response experiments (Fig. 4 B). Three residues (Phe-6, Lys-25, and Tyr-26) highly contribute to BgK binding to Kv1.2, because their alanine substitution induced an affinity decrease larger than 20-fold (above 500-fold in the case of K25A and F6A). The substitution of three other residues (Arg-12, His-13, and Ser-23) induced a moderate, 5–20-fold increase inK D . On rKv1.3 channels expressed in Xenopusoocytes, the dissociation constant of BgK was 7.6 ± 0.9 nm. Preliminary experiments were performed using a 50 nm concentration of each peptide, and the scan distinguished a group of 13 residues, the substitution of which increased the K D by >5-fold (Fig. 5 A). These are Phe-6, Lys-7, His-13, Leu-17, Asn-19, Thr-22, Ser-23, Gln-24, Lys-25, Tyr-26, Arg-27, Asn-29, and Leu-36. The respective K D values of analogs were determined by performing dose-response experiments. Fig. 5 Bsummarizes the results and shows that seven residues (Phe-6, Lys-7, Asn-19, Ser-23, Gln-24, Lys-25, and Tyr-26) highly contributed to the toxin binding to Kv1.3 (affinity decrease between 20- and 100-fold), whereas the six other residues (His-13, Leu-17, Thr-22, Arg-27, Asn-29, and Leu-36) induced a 5–20-fold increase in K D . Before concluding that an affinity decrease observed upon substitution reflects the functional contribution of the substituted residue, we assessed by circular dichroism that the secondary structure of the protein mutants was not different from that of the wild-type BgK. In the 185–250 nm region, 20 of the monosubstituted analogs displayed circular dichroic spectra similar to that of BgK with a minimum at 215 nm and a maximum at 192 nm. This observation shows that they all possess a similar content in secondary structure, suggesting that their overall conformation is similar to that of the wild-type BgK. By contrast, substitution of five residues (Asn-29, Lys-32, T33A, Glu-35, and Leu-36) induced some distortions in the dichroic spectra of the corresponding proteins (Fig. 6). The superimposed spectra of the four analogs K32A, T33A, E35A, and L36A displayed minimum at 215 nm and maximum at 192 nm, but with substantially different intensities as compared with the spectrum of BgK. Close inspection of the 15 best NMR structures of BgK (32Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Meideros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol.

More precisely, the methyl group of Thr-33 and one of Leu-36 are close to the methylene groups of half-cysteines 11, 30, and 34. Therefore, alanine substitution of Thr-33 and Leu-36, which are in the vicinity of the disulfide 11–30 and 20–34, might alter the three-dimensional structure of the protein. For the analogs K32A and E35A, the distorsions observed in their CD spectra could not be readily interpreted. The dichroic spectra of the analog N29A and BgK displayed the same overall shape, although the minimum and maximum signals were shifted to 208 and 189 nm respectively (Fig. 6). This finding suggests that substitution N29A might have reinforced the helicity within the helical region 24–30. Because of the observed modification in the CD spectra of analogs N29A, K32A, T33A, E35A, and L36A, the functional effects associated with these substitutions should be interpreted wit"
https://openalex.org/W2062149532,"We generated transgenic mice with two P1 artificial chromosomes, each containing the human renin (HREN) gene and extending to −35 and −75 kilobase pairs, respectively. HREN protein production was restricted to juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, and its expression was tightly regulated by angiotensin II and sodium. The magnitude of the up- and down-regulation in HREN mRNA caused by the stimuli tested was identical to the endogenous renin gene, suggesting tight physiological regulation. P1 artificial chromosome mice were mated with transgenic mice overexpressing human angiotensinogen to determine if there was a chronic compensatory down-regulation of the transgene. Despite a 3-fold down-regulation of HREN mRNA, plasma angiotensin II and blood pressure was modestly elevated in the double transgenic mice. Nevertheless, this elevation was significantly less than a different double transgenic model containing a poorly regulated HREN transgene. The increase in blood pressure, despite the decrease in HREN mRNA, suggests that the HREN gene can partially, but not completely, compensate for excess circulating angiotensinogen. These data suggest the possibility that increases in circulating or tissue angiotensinogen may cause an increase in blood pressure in humans, even in the presence of a functionally active servo-mechanism to down-regulate HREN expression."

The finding that NF-κB is activated during or immediately before cell apoptosis under certain stimulatory conditions has led to the suggestion that this transcription factor may function to promote apoptosis. Several lines of evidence support this suggestion. Treatment of human thymocytes or promyelocytic leukemia cells with etoposide activates NF-κB and induces apoptosis (6Bessho R. Matsubara K.

It has been demonstrated that the transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on the genes encoding zinc finger protein A20 and a Bcl-2 family member, Bfl-1/A1, is through one or two NF-κB binding sites located in their promoter regions (23Sarma V.

It remains to be elucidated, however, whether a similar transcriptional regulating pathway is involved in NF-κB-mediated expression of other anti-apoptotic genes. Bcl-x was first identified using a murine bcl-2 cDNA probe under low stringency conditions to identifybcl-2-related genes in chicken lymphoid cells. The product of bcl-x gene, Bcl-x, has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis induced by a wide range of agents that also activate NF-κB transcription factor in a variety of cell lines (24Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2906) Google Scholar). Bcl-x is transiently expressed in immature intermediate cells such as pro- and pre-B cells and double-positive T cells (25Fang W. Weintraub B.C. Dunlap B. Garside P. Pape K.A. Jenkins M.K. Goodnow C.C. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. Immunity. 1998; 9: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and is known to be up-regulated as a consequence of antigen receptor cross-linking, an important extracellular signal leading to the activation of NF-κB. In macrophages, Bcl-x was up-regulated by interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide, two well known NF-κB activators (26Okada S. Zhang H. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2590-2596PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-x was predominantly expressed in malignant cells in which NF-κB was usually overactivated (27Xerri L. Parc P. Brousset P. Schlaifer D. Hassoun J. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Birnbaum D. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28Bargou R.C. Daniel P.T. Mapara M.Y. Bommert K. Wagener C. Kallinich B. Royer H.D. Dorken B. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that silica, a mineral dust with potent fibrogenic effect, can activate NF-κB constitutively through the induction of a proteasome-independent degradation of IκBα protein (29Chen F. Sun S.C. Kuh D.C. Gaydos L.J. Demers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Chen F. Lu Y. Kuhn D.C. Maki M. Shi X. Sun S.C. Demers L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, several reports implied a possible transformatic effect of silica on certain cell lines (31Gao H. Brick J. Ong S. Miller M. Whong W.Z. Ong T. Cancer Lett. 1997; 112: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Driscoll K.E. Deyo L.C. Howard B.W. Poynter J. Carter J.M. Exp. Lung Res. 1995; 21: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since NF-κB is activated following silica exposure, it is likely that some anti-apoptotic genes required for the formation of fibrosis or transformation will be affected by the silica-induced NF-κB activation. To elucidate the possible transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on the expression of Bcl-x, an important anti-apoptotic protein abundant in macrophages, we analyzed the 5′-flanking promoter region of the bcl-x gene encoding Bcl-x proteins and identified several potential NF-κB binding sites that may be critical in mediating silica-induced bcl-x gene expression. Resident peritoneal macrophages were harvested from both wild type and NF-κB p50 gene knockout (p50−/−) C57BL/6 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) 3–4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 4% thioglycollate broth, plated as described (33Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). The murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All of the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, DC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1000 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma). Expression vectors for NF-κB p65 and p50 were gifts from Dr. Shao-Cong Sun (Penn State University, Hershey, PA). A reporter construct containing 0.625 kilobases of thebcl-x gene promoter (−1215 to −590) inserted into the upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (pGL2–0.6L) was provided by Dr. Gabriel Nunez (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI). Macrophages were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates at 5 × 105 cells/ml for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were transfected with indicated expression vectors using DEAE-dextran method (29Chen F. Sun S.C. Kuh D.C. Gaydos L.J. Demers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells in each well were incubated with 2 μg of DNA and 1 ml of transfection buffer for 2 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was determined after a 24- to 48-h incubation of cells in 5% fetal bovine serum and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Whole cell extracts were mixed with 3× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. The resolved proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A Western blot was performed using antibodies against Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates. The extraction of nuclear proteins and preparation of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the κB consensus or κB-like sequences derived from the bcl-x gene promoter were performed as described previously (29Chen F. Sun S.C. Kuh D.C. Gaydos L.J. Demers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that crystalline silica is a potent inducer for the activation of NF-κB transcription factor in murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (29Chen F. Sun S.C. Kuh D.C. Gaydos L.J. Demers L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 985-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Chen F. Lu Y. Kuhn D.C. Maki M. Shi X. Sun S.C. Demers L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine the capability of silica to activate NF-κB in macrophages from both wild type and NF-κB p50 gene knockout (p50−/−) mice, we incubated both types of peritoneal macrophages with 0–20 μg/ml silica for 3 h. As shown in Fig. 1 A, whereas NF-κB p50/p50 homodimers were preferentially induced by silica in wild type macrophages, the p65-containing complex appeared to be the major NF-κB complex induced by silica in p50−/− macrophages. The composition of the NF-κB complex was confirmed by supershift assay using specific antibodies against both NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits. In wild type macrophages (p50+/+) stimulated with silica, a high density p50 supershift band and a marginal p65 supershift band could be identified. In contrast, silica-stimulated p50−/− macrophages exhibited only a p65 supershift band (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 2 A depicted that p50−/− macrophages are more resistant than p50+/+ macrophages to a high dose of silica- or vanadate-induced cell death (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Thus, it may be speculated that some anti-apoptotic factors may be induced due to the preferential activation of a p65-containing NF-κB complex in p50−/− macrophages. In macrophages, Bcl-2 and its related family members are the most abundant anti-apoptotic proteins in response to apoptotic stimuli. Western blot analysis indicated an equal expression of Bcl-2 in both wild type and p50−/− peritoneal macrophages in the absence or presence of 5 or 20 μg/ml silica (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). In contrast, an elevated level of basal and silica-induced Bcl-x protein was found in p50−/− peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). This may explain the enhanced resistance of p50−/− macrophages against silica-induced cell death. To explore further the potential regulation of the expression of bcl-x by NF-κB, a transient co-transfection experiment was performed. Due to the difficulty in achieving a high efficiency of transfection in primary macrophages, a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was used for following studies. Macrophages were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing a 0.625-kilobase promoter region (−1215 to −590) of thebcl-x gene and an expression vector for the NF-κB p50 or p65 subunit. A NF-κB reporter construct containing two κB elements corresponding to the κB sites in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat region served as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 3, in the presence of silica for 12 h, a significant increase of luciferase activity was detected in macrophages transfected with a NF-κB reporter construct. However, silica failed to induce an appreciable change of luciferase activity in macrophages transfected with a reporter construct containing thebcl-x gene promoter. The failure of silica to inducebcl-x promoter activity in RAW264.7 cells may be due to the existence of unidentified negative-regulating elements in thebcl-x promoter or the abundance of endogenous NF-κB p50/p50 homodimers that are considered as less active or repressive transcriptional factors. In partial agreement with this notion, co-transfection suggested that NF-κB p65, but not p50, enhanced silica-induced bcl-x promoter activity (Fig. 3). The 5′-flanking promoter region of the mousebcl-x gene has been isolated previously and characterized by Grillot et al. (34Grillot D.A. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the regulation ofbcl-x in macrophages by NF-κB occurs on the transcriptional level, we first analyzed the 5′-flanking promoter region of the mouse bcl-x gene. By the use of Transcription Element Search Software (TESS), a number of putative NF-κB binding sites was identified in the region of −1010 to −761 of thebcl-x gene (Fig. 4). Several sites among these can also be identified in the human bcl-xpromoter region (data not shown). To establish whether these κB-like elements were involved in bcl-x expression, a series of oligonucleotides containing each of these putative κB sites were synthesized and used as probes in EMSA to evaluate the binding of NF-κB. Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW264.7 cells incubated with silica for 3 h and used in this assay. Fig. 5 A shows that incubation of cells with silica resulted in the induction of NF-κB complexes that bound to a consensus κB site and κB-like sites 1, 2, 3, and 5 in the bcl-x gene promoter, although the composition and affinity of these complexes for each site were different. Whereas all of these sites can be bound by the NF-κB p50 homodimer as judged by anti-p50 antibody supershift assay (lane 2 in eachpanel), only sites 1 and 2 can be bound by p50/p65 heterodimers with lower affinity. No appreciable binding of p50/p50 homodimer or p50/p65 heterodimer on the putative κB site 4 was detected (panel 5). By the use of p50 abundant and p65 abundant nuclear proteins extracted from both wild type and p50−/− macrophages stimulated with silica, the recognition of these sites by different NF-κB family members was further confirmed (Fig. 5 B). As indicated in Fig. 5 B, the consensus κB site could be bound by both the NF-κB p50/p50 homodimer (lane 1) and NF-κB p65-containing complex (lane 2). When incubated with a mixture of p50 abundant and p65 abundant nuclear proteins extracted from silica-stimulated wild type and p50−/− macrophages, respectively, this consensus κB DNA fragment was preferentially bound by NF-κB p65-containing complex (lane 2). Again, κB-like sites 1, 2, 3, and 5 derived from the 5′-flanking promoter region of the bcl-x gene could be predominantly bound by NF-κB p50/p50 homodimer. A marginal p65-containing complex binding tobcl-x κB-like sites 1 and 2 could be observed (lanes 4 and 6).FIG. 5NF-κB binding to putative κB sites within the −1010 to −761 region of the bcl-x promoter. A, nuclear proteins extracted from silica-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages were incubated with a DNA fragment encompassing a consensus κB site (panel 1), bclx-κB-like site 1 (panel 2), bclx-κB-like site 2 (panel 3), bclx-κB-like site 3 (panel 4), bclx-κB-like site 4 (panel 5), and bclx-κB-like site 5 (panel 6) in the presence of preimmune serum (PI, lane 1), anti-p50 antibody (lane 2), anti-p52 antibody (lane 3), and anti-p65 antibody (lane 4).

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins can also interact with a wide range of proteins, including calcineurin, p53-binding protein-2, Apaf-1, and adenine nucleotide translocator. These interactions may account for their cytoprotective effects in apoptotic stimulation resulting from Ca2+ overload, p53 induction, and exposure to mitochondrial damaging agents (36Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 37Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Overexpression of bcl-2 or bcl-x has been demonstrated to provide a survival advantage after many diverse stimuli, including growth factor withdrawn, radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (38Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4746) Google Scholar, 39Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 40McDonnell T.J. Beham A. Sarkiss M. Andersen M.M. Lo P. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1008-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x proteins exert different potencies in the regulation of apoptosis. Bcl-x appears to be a more efficient suppressor of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in murine lymphoid cells engineered to overexpress either bcl-2 or bcl-x (41Arriola E.L. Rodriguez-Lopez A.M. Hickman J.A. Chresta C.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1457-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Gene knockout studies indicated that bcl-x −/− mice died in utero as a result of massive death of erythroid and neuronal cells, whereas bcl-2 −/− mice developed normally in the early stages (42Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 43Michaelidis T.M. Sendtner M. Cooper J.D. Airaksinen M.S. Holtmann B. Meyer M. Thoenen H. Neuron. 1996; 17: 75-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Bcl-x is predominantly expressed by neoplastic cells and is considered a more potential contributor to the pathogenesis of malignant transformation (27Xerri L. Parc P. Brousset P. Schlaifer D. Hassoun J. Reed J.C. Krajewski S. Birnbaum D. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 900-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,28Bargou R.C. Daniel P.T. Mapara M.Y. Bommert K. Wagener C. Kallinich B. Royer H.D. Dorken B. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The present studies show that in contrast with the wild type macrophages, p50−/− macrophages express a higher level of Bcl-x protein. In these cells, NF-κB p65-containing complex was preferentially induced by silica stimulation. Overexpression of NF-κB p65, but not p50, resulted in enhancement of silica-inducedbcl-x promoter activity. DNA sequence analysis of 5′-flanking promoter region of the bcl-x gene demonstrated the existence of five putative κB sites located in the region of −1010 to −761. EMSA characterized that these sites could be recognized and bound by NF-κB p50/p50 homodimer, whereas only sites 1 and 2 can be appreciably bound by NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer (Fig. 5,A and B). These differences in binding among the individual κB-like site apparently result from the differences in their sequences. Previous studies have suggested that a GGG motif at the 5′ end of the κB site is required for p50 homodimer binding, whereas a TTTCC motif at the 3′ half of κB site is essential for the binding of NF-κB p65-containing complexes (44Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 45Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Since all of the κB-like sites in the bcl-x promoter lack of TTTCC motif at the 3′ half required for p65 binding, the sequence characteristic of κB-like sites in the bcl-x promoter favors the binding of p50/p50 homodimers. The p50/p50 homodimer was largely considered as a nonactive or even an inhibitory NF-κB complex in macrophages. In support of this, our observations suggest that bcl-xinduction will be compromised in wild type macrophages due to the existence of abundant p50 proteins. The possible regulatory role of NF-κB on the expression of thebcl-x gene has been recently suggested in a neurodegenerative animal model. By the introduction of a repressor IκBα containing serine-alanine mutations in residues 32 and 36 into neurons, Tamatani et al. (20Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) provided evidence indirectly indicating an up-regulatory role of NF-κB on the expression ofbcl-x (20Tamatani M. Che Y.H. Matsuzaki H. Ogawa S. Okado H. Miyake S. Mizuno T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8531-8538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of bcl-x gene expression by activated NF-κB may exert a neuroprotective effect in response to brain injury. By the search of human bcl-x gene promoter, Dixon et al. (46Dixon E.P. Stephenson D.T. Clemens J.A. Little S.P. Brain Res. 1997; 776: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) identified three κB-like sites within −720 to −59 region of human bcl-x gene. Reporter gene assay using constructs containing a series of deleted promoter regions of the human bcl-x gene in human 293 cell line suggested that only the distal κB-like site could be functional in response to NF-κB-mediated bcl-x promoter activity. However, an opposite effect, pro-apoptotic effect, of NF-κB was suggested by this study based on the finding of a short form of Bcl-x protein, Bcl-xs with a pro-apoptotic activity, in ischemic rat brain. Our results are complementary to a recent report by Grumont et al. (21Grumont R.J. Rourke I.J. Gerondakis S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), who have demonstrated enhanced expression of another anti-apoptotic product, murine Bcl-2 homolog (Bfl-1/A1), in p50−/−, but not c-rel−/− splenocytes, induced by concanavalin A or anti-CD3/anti-CD28. A nucleotide sequence search of the Bfl-1/A1 promoter revealed a single κB-like motif, 5′-AGGGGATCCC-3′, located between −488 and −479. EMSA indicated potent binding of the p50/p50 homodimer to this site. These results further addressed the differential regulation of bcl-2family members by different NF-κB family members. Despite the indication that most of the anti-apoptotic genes are up-regulated by NF-κB transcription factor, a direct evidence of transcriptional regulation of NF-κB on these genes, such as cIAP1,cIAP2, xIAP, and IEX-1L, is still missing. Analysis of the promoter regions of most of the anti-apoptotic genes using TESS program, we have identified NF-κB binding site(s) located in the 5′-flanking or intron region of these genes (Table I). Therefore, transcriptional activation of NF-κB on anti-apoptotic genes must be a common mechanism involved in the prosurvival or protective effect in response to apoptotic stimuli. It has been well established that overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes is connected with the oncogenesis and resistance of tumor cells to anti-cancer therapy. The study of NF-κB, a genetic switch governing the expression of anti-apoptotic genes, consequently should offer a new therapeutic strategy for the tissue proliferative diseases such as silica- and other agent-induced fibrosis and carcinogenesis.Table IPotential NF-κB binding sites in the promoter or 5′-flanking region of human anti-apoptotic genesGeneκB-like site(s)TESS scoreGenBank™ IDcIAP11643-GGACATTTCC-165212AF0706742719-GGCTAGTCCC-272813cIAP2188-AGAAATTTCA-197aCD28RE/κB-site.16U45879NAIP241-AGTAATTCCA-250aCD28RE/κB-site.16U80017692-TGGAATTGCT-701aCD28RE/κB-site.161331-GGGGAATCGC-1340143007-GTAATTTCCT-3016163094-TGGAATCTCC-3103183169-GGGGCTATCC-317818Survivin818-GGGGGCCACC-82712U752852013-GGGCTTTCCC-2022124366-GGGAGACTCC-4375bLocated within intron region.205096-GGGAGTGGAC-6005bLocated within intron region.16bcl-2556-GGGGCGTCCC-56512X51898952-GCGATTCCCC-96114bcl-x145-GAGAAGTCCC-15412D30746642-GGGGACTGCC-65116658-GTGACTTTCC-66716bfl-1/A1cMouse DNA sequence.424-GGACAGACCC-43412AF1103861135-TGGAAGTTCT-1144aCD28RE/κB-site.161522-ATTTTATCCC-15311728-AGAAATTCTA-1737aCD28RE/κB-site.16IEX-1L244-CGGAATTTCC-25315AF07596TERTdTelomerase reverse transcriptase.437-GCAATTTCCT-44616AF098956608-GGGAAGTCCT-617131853-GCGGCTTTCC-186218a CD28RE/κB-site.b Located within intron region.c Mouse DNA sequence.d Telomerase reverse transcriptase.

CSF-1-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels were similar in wild-type and me/me BMM, except for the constitutive hyperphosphorylation of a 62-kDa phosphoprotein (pp62) in me/me macrophages. pp62 was identified as the RASGAP-associated p62DOK and was shown to be the major CSF-1R-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in CSF-1-treated BMM. p62DOK was found to be constitutively associated with SHP-1 in BMM and in 293T cells, co-expressing p62 dok and either wild-type or catalytically inert SHP-1 (SHP-1 C453S). In both cell types, the interaction of SHP-1 with p62DOK occurred independently of p62DOK tyrosine phosphorylation, but only the tyrosine-phosphorylated p62DOK was bound by SHP-1 C453S in a far Western analysis. These findings suggest a constitutive association of SHP-1 and p62DOK that is either conformation-dependent or indirect as well as a direct, inducible association of the SHP-1 catalytic domain with tyrosine-phosphorylated p62DOK. p62DOKhyperphosphorylation is not associated with altered CSF-1-induced RAS signaling or proliferation. However, whereas wild-type macrophages undergo cell death following CSF-1 removal, me/memacrophages exhibit prolonged survival in the absence of growth factor. Thus, p62DOK is a major SHP-1 substrate whose tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with growth factor-independent survival in macrophages.

CSF-1 mediates these effects by binding to the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R), a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene (reviewed in Ref. 1Stanley E.R. Berg K.L. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S.W. Pixley F.J. Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). CSF-1 treatment of macrophages results in CSF-1R dimerization, activation, and receptor transphosphorylation at specific tyrosines within the cytoplasmic domain, the latter of which mediate recruitment of cytoplasmic signaling molecules containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding domains (reviewed in Refs. 2Rohrschneider L.R.

Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The activated CSF-1R has been shown to form multimeric complexes with a number of signal-transducing proteins including Shc, Grb2, Sos1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Cbl (4Lioubin M.N.

Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated to associate directly with the receptor via their SH2 domains. In addition, both the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-1 (10Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

In myeloid progenitor cells, the CSF-1R has also been reported to interact with the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase, SHIP (13Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), phospholipase C-γ2 (14Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and a recently characterized adaptor protein, Mona (15Bourette R.P. Arnaud S. Myles G.M. Blanchet J.P. Rohrschneider L.R. Mouchiroud G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7273-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to these upstream interactions, CSF-1R signaling also results in the activation of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (reviewed in Ref.3Hamilton J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanisms whereby the activated receptor induces RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and downstream biological outcomes such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation have not yet been defined. At present it is also unclear how signals initiated by the activated CSF-1R are modulated. However, the SHP-1 protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) represents a particularly attractive candidate for regulating CSF-1 signaling. SHP-1 is a non-transmembrane PTP possessing tandem amino-terminal SH2 domains followed by a single catalytic domain and a short carboxyl-terminal tail. In contrast to the closely related, ubiquitously expressed SHP-2 PTP (reviewed in Ref. 16Stein-Gerlach M. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 1998; 30: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), SHP-1 is expressed only in epithelial and hematopoietic cells and appears to act predominantly as a negative regulator of growth-promoting cell receptors. SHP-1 binds and inhibits a number of receptor PTKs, such as c-Kit, and regulates cytokine receptors lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity by direct association and dephosphorylation of the associated Jak kinases (reviewed in Ref. 17Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). SHP-1 also inhibits signaling from both the T- and B-cell antigen receptors, by interactions with both the antigen receptor components, and PTKs such as Lck, ZAP-70, and Syk, required for antigen receptor signaling (17Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar,18Dustin L.B. Plas D.R. Wong J. Hu Y.H.T. Soto C. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of SHP-1 on these latter receptors is also realized by interactions with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) of antigen receptor co-modulators such as FcγRIIB, CD22, CD72 (reviewed in Refs. 19Siminovitch K.A. Neel B.G. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 329-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 20Wu Y.J. Nadler M.J.S. Brennan L.A. Gish G.D. Timms J.F. Fusaki N. Jongstra-Bilen J. Tada N. Pawson T.

Med. 1998; 187: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in B-cells. Similarly, SHP-1 inhibits T-cell activation and natural killer cell function by associating with the ITIMs of human killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs) or the murine LY49 receptors (reviewed in Refs. 23Unkeless J.C. Jin J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 24Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R. BioEssays. 1999; 19: 417-427Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and also associates with a number of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (reviewed in Ref. 25Yokoyama W.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1803-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recruitment of SHP-1 to KIRs has been shown to result in the dephosphorylation of critical signaling molecules, such as the adaptor protein SLP-76 (26Binstadt B.A. Billadeau D.D. Jevremovic D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27518-27523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), resulting in the termination of FcR signaling. More recently SHP-1 has been implicated in the negative regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion of macrophages and platelets; these effects are apparently mediated by SHP-1 regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (27Roach T.I.A. Slater S.E. White L.S. Zhang X.L. Majerus P.W. Brown E.J. Thomas M.L. Curr.

Chem. 1998; 273: 28332-28340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), respectively. Much of the genetic evidence underscoring the biological significance of SHP-1 in vivo has been derived from analysis of SHP-1-deficient motheaten (me/me) andmotheaten-viable(me v /me v ) mice. Both theme/me and me v /me v mutations are single base pair changes that lead to aberrant splicing of the SHP-1 transcript and result in either a lack of SHP-1 expression (me/me) or expression of altered, full-length forms of SHP-1, with substantially reduced catalytic activity (me v /me v ) (reviewed in Ref. 29Bignon J.S. Siminovitch K.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both strains of mice exhibit increased numbers of erythropoietic precursor cells, granulocytes, macrophages, and CD-5 positive B-cells and die prematurely of hemorrhagic pneumonitis, consequent to massive infiltration of granulocytes and macrophages in the lungs (29Bignon J.S. Siminovitch K.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous studies of bone-marrow macrophages from me/me and wild-type mice have suggested that SHP-1 regulates interferon-α-induced Jak-Stat signaling (30David M. Chen H.Y.E. Goelz S. Larner A.C. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7050-7058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) as well as CSF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation (31Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and associates constitutively with an unidentified 130-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein (pp130) (31Chen H.E. Chang S. Trub T. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3685-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Subsequently, pp130 was shown to be a membrane-spanning glycoprotein and a substrate of SHP-1 in macrophages and was identified as comprising p91/PIR-B (32Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22719-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), or the SHPS-1-related protein BIT (32Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H. Kamatkar S. Nadler M.J.S. Rohrschneider L.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3838-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Both SHPS-1 and BIT belong to the SIRPα1 family of signal inhibitory related proteins, which has recently been implicated in the negative regulation of receptor PTK signaling (37Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z.J. Sures I. Wang H.Y. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Although two major SHP-1-associated proteins have been identified in macrophages, it is unclear how impaired interactions between these proteins and SHP-1 contribute to the profound dysregulation of macrophages seen inme/me mice. In the present study, we show that a major substrate for SHP-1 in primary bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMM) is the recently characterized signaling molecule, p62DOK. A 62-kDa phosphoprotein (p62) was originally shown to associate with the p120 RASGTPase-activating protein (GAP) and to be regulated by a number of mitogenic and transforming tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors, v-SRC, v-ABL, and v-FMS (38Moran M.F. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1804-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 39Ellis C. Moran M. McCormick F. Pawson T. Nature. 1990; 343: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). More recently p62 was characterized as a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitor cells (40Wisniewski D. Strife A. Wojciechowicz D. Lambek C. Clarkson B. Leukemia (Balt.). 1994; 8: 688-693PubMed Google Scholar) and was subsequently purified, cloned, and demonstrated to be the RASGAP-associated p62, termed p62DOK (for downstream ofkinase) (41Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 42Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our findings show that p62DOKbecomes transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with the CSF-1R following macrophage treatment with CSF-1. In contrast to control macrophages, SHP-1-deficient macrophages from me/memice manifest constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p62DOK, which appears to represent a direct substrate of SHP-1. This constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of p62DOKis correlated with the increased growth factor-independent survival of SHP-1-deficient macrophages. Femoral and tibial bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were obtained from 2- to 3-week-oldme/me or me v /me v and wild-type littermate control mice as described (43Stanley E.R. Pollard J.W. Walker J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1990: 299-302Google Scholar). Briefly, bone marrow cells were incubated for 24 h in α+ medium (α-minimal essential medium containing 0.292 mg/ml glutamine, 0.02 mg/ml asparagine, 5 × 10−5mβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 g/liter penicillin, and 0.2 g/liter streptomycin) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (BioWhittaker), 10% WEHI-3 conditioned media, as a source of interleukin-3, and 12 ng/ml CSF-1 (a gift from Chiron, Inc.). Non-adherent primitive mononuclear phagocytes were reseeded in α+ media containing 15% fetal calf serum and CSF-1 (120 ng/ml) for 48 h, in order to allow their differentiation to adherent mononuclear phagocytes. The resulting adherent macrophages were passaged once into experimental plates. BAC1.2F5 cell line macrophages were maintained in α+ media supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 36 ng/ml CSF-1. Cells (either BMM or BAC1.2F5) used in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were cultured until subconfluent (∼5 × 106 cells/plate) and then incubated for ∼20 h in the absence of CSF-1 to allow for CSF-1R up-regulation. Up-regulated cells were stimulated with CSF-1 (360 ng/ml) for various times and then solubilized as described below. Cells used for apoptosis assays were cultured until confluent and then maintained in media without CSF-1 for various times. Fragmented genomic DNA was isolated (44Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the insulin receptor (45Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. Siddle K. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6366-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.292 mg/ml glutamine, 0.2 g/liter penicillin, 0.2 g/liter streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells used for experiments were cultured until subconfluent, maintained in media without serum for approximately 48 h, and then stimulated with 10 nminsulin. For analysis of BMM growth rates, me/me and wild-type macrophages were plated at 2 × 104 cells in 2 ml of α+ medium (containing 15% fetal calf serum and 120 ng/ml CSF-1) per 35-mm dish. After 48 h (day 1) the medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with medium without CSF-1 and refed with media with or without CSF-1. Subsequently the medium was changed every 3 days. On day 6 some of the plates grown in medium without CSF-1 were refed with medium containing CSF-1. Cell counts were performed daily on triplicate cultures. Adherent macrophages were removed using 0.005% CHAPS (Sigma), diluted in Isoton II (Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc.), and counted electronically using a Coulter Counter ZM. A polyclonal rabbit antibody was prepared against a GST fusion protein encoding the amino-terminal half of p62DOK, but because of the relatively low titer of this antiserum it was only used in one experiment (Fig. 4 A). For all subsequent experiments, the 2C4 monoclonal antibody that recognizes p62DOK (Babco) was used for immunoprecipitation, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the amino-terminal region of p62DOK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunoblotting. Peptide purified antibodies to the CSF-1R have been described previously (46Büscher D. Dello Sbarba P. Hipskind R.A. Rapp U.R. Stanley E.R. Baccarini M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3323-3332PubMed Google Scholar) and were used for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Antiserum to the SH2 domain of SHP-1 has been described (47Somani A.K. Bignon J.S. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21113-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and was used for immunoprecipitations. A peptide purified antibody directed against a unique carboxyl-terminal peptide in SHP-1 (10Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for immunoblotting. A monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY-20) was from Transduction Laboratories, and RAS antibody Y13-259 linked to agarose was from Oncogene Science. Cells were solubilized in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 μm ZnCl2). Whole cell lysates were normalized for either total protein using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) or by immunoblotting for CSF-1R protein. Lysates containing equivalent amounts of protein or CSF-1R were used in subsequent experiments. Normalized Nonidet P-40 cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of purified antibodies or with a 1:50 dilution of antiserum, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously (10Yeung Y.-G. Berg K.L. Pixley F.J. Angeletti R.H. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23447-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting all primary antibodies were used at 2 μg/ml and secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) were diluted 1:5000, except for immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) antibody, where a monoclonal antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a dilution of 1:7500. Resulting signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression plasmids for c-fms, p62 dok , and SHP-1 were obtained by subcloning each of these cDNAs into the pCMV5 vector. The catalytically inactive (C453S) SHP-1 was generated by introducing a point mutation using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques. All expression constructs were sequenced and subsequently tested by transient transfection into human embryonic kidney 293T cells using the standard calcium-phosphate method. Transfected cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CSF-1R, anti-p62DOK, and anti-SHP-1 antibodies. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression plasmids encoding the tandem SH2 domains of SHP-1, full-length wild-type and C453S SHP-1 (47Somani A.K. Bignon J.S. Mills G.B. Siminovitch K.A. Branch D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21113-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α, and the fusion proteins were purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacteria with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads. The GST fusion protein encoding the RASGAP amino-terminal SH2 domain was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For binding studies, 5 μg of each GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads were incubated with 1 mg of protein lysate overnight at 4 °C. The beads and bound proteins were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by anti-PY and anti-p62DOK immunoblotting. For far Western analyses, the immobilized GST fusion proteins were eluted by incubation with 10 mm glutathione (Sigma) and the eluted proteins quantitated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Western blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with 1 μg/ml of the appropriate GST fusion protein overnight at 4 °C. Washed blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml of a polyclonal GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. Washed blots were then incubated with a secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and developed by ECL. me/memacrophage protein lysates were treated with 10 mmiodoacetic acid to inactivate irreversibly endogenous PTPs. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with either α-p62DOK or α-CSF-1R antibodies, and the resulting immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, twice in phosphatase wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and once in phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The immune complexes were then resuspended in phosphatase buffer supplemented with either GST-SHP-1 wild-type or GST-SHP-1 C453S and incubated at 37 °C for various times. The reactions were stopped by washing once in ice-cold wash buffer (without Nonidet P-40) with 10 mmiodoacetic acid and once in ice-cold wash buffer with 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, followed by elution in SDS sample buffer. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and anti-PY Western blotting. This analysis was performed as described previously (48Büscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent plates ofme/me and wild-type BMM were incubated for 16 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. The plates were rinsed 3 times with phosphate-free DMEM and labeled for 4 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At the end of the labeling period, the cells were treated with 360 ng/ml CSF-1 for the indicated times, washed 3 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin), vortexed, and centrifuged for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of agarose-immobilized RAS antibody with gentle agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer and three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm GTP, and 0.1 mm GDP and heated at 75 °C for 5 min. Equal counts of the eluates were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates and developed with 1m KH2PO4, pH 4.0. The plates were exposed to film for approximately 4 h, and the resulting autoradiographic signals were quantitated by densitometry using the ImageQuant densitometry program (Molecular Dynamics). To identify potential substrates of SHP-1 in myeloid cells, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from wild-type andme/me mice were compared with respect to the pattern of CSF-1-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To this end, wild-type and me/me macrophages were stimulated with CSF-1 for various times, and the cells were then subjected to lysis in Nonidet P-40, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) antibody. In both wild-type and me/me cells, CSF-1 stimulation resulted in transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the CSF-1R and several other proteins; the phosphorylation levels peaked at 1 min, and returned to a basal level by 10 min (Fig. 1). The kinetics and level of total protein tyrosine phosphorylation appeared similar in the wild-type and mutant cells, although tyrosine phosphorylation of both the CSF-1R and a phosphoprotein of ∼95 kDa was slightly elevated in me/meBMM. Most significantly, however, the control and me/mecells differed substantially with respect to the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62-kDa phosphoprotein, pp62, one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins observed in me/me cells. In contrast to its transient and rather modest tyrosine phosphorylation in CSF-1-treated wild-type cells, pp62 appeared significantly more phosphorylated in the CSF-1-treated me/me cells and also remained phosphorylated in the latter cells for a more prolonged period. Even more striking, however, was the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of pp62 observed in the absence of CSF-1 only inme/me cells. These results thus identify pp62 as a potential participant in CSF-1R signaling and also indicate a role for SHP-1 in modulating pp62 tyrosine phosphorylation in both the absence and presence of CSF-1. The RASGAP-associated p62 is one of the many proteins that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in hematopoietic cells in response to activation of receptor PTKs. A p62 was originally described as a protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated by"

By far the most common mechanism for priming DNA synthesis involves the utilization of short oligoribonucleotides. Replicative DNA polymerases efficiently add deoxynucleotides to the 3′-end of RNA primers annealed to ssDNA.1 In the cell, these RNA primers are synthesized by a specialized enzyme, DNA primase, a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyzes the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides at specific DNA sequences (1Griep M.A. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 32: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic analysis of oligoribonucleotide synthesis by DNA primases has been complicated primarily because DNA primases function as part of macromolecular complexes. These multiprotein complexes often catalyze additional reactions affecting NTP or DNA concentrations, confounding the examination of RNA synthesis alone. Moreover, when DNA primases have been separated from these complexes, their RNA synthesis activities are often profoundly decreased (2Swart J.R.

The smaller 56-kDa protein translocates 5′-to-3′ on ssDNA and unwinds duplex DNA (helicase activity) in a reaction coupled to the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates (8Kolodner R. Richardson C.C.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15208-15216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) uses these oligoribonucleotides as primers.Although the presence of helicase and primase activities in the 63-kDa protein simplifies reconstruction of the T7 replisome (16Debyser Z. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the competitive effects of multiple activities have complicated characterization of the T7 DNA primase and helicase activities. For example, although the T7 helicase preferentially hydrolyzes dTTP as the energy source to unwind double-stranded DNA, the enzyme also hydrolyzes ATP (11Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, this activity would dramatically lower the concentration of ATP in primase assays, and therefore artificially low rates of primer synthesis would be recorded. The absence of primase activity in the 56-kDa gene 4 protein has enabled detailed kinetic studies to be conducted using the T7 helicase (10Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Washington M.T. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7880-7887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, a “helicase fragment” that contains only the C-terminal helicase domain of the T7 gene 4 protein has been purified and crystallized (20Bird L.E. Hakansson K. Pan H. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2620-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).When the start codon for the small form of the gene 4 protein is eliminated by substituting methionine-64 with leucine (22Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or glycine (23Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the mutant alleles support the growth of phage lacking gene 4. When purified, the 63-kDa gene 4 M64L (22Rosenberg A.H. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Studier F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15005-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and M64G (23Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) proteins are indistinguishable from wild-type 63-kDa gene 4 protein. The 63-kDa gene 4 M64G allele was modified to code for a protein containing only the N-terminal 271 amino acids of the T7 gene 4 protein. This “primase fragment” lacks dTTPase and helicase activities but retains primase activity (24Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The elimination of the DNA-binding site in the helicase domain of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein allows the direct analysis of protein-DNA interactions occurring at the active site for oligonucleotide synthesis. Comparisons of DNA binding of the primase fragment and the full-length protein reveal that DNA binds more tightly to the helicase domain than to the primase domain of the gene 4 protein, presenting two complications for the study of primer synthesis. First, the tight binding of the DNA to the helicase domain often results in the contamination of 63-kDa gene 4 protein preparations with trace amounts of DNA. Removal of DNA from the gene 4 protein is aggravated by the fact that this tightly bound DNA is protected from digestion by nucleases (25Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Yong Y. Romano L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24509-24517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Second, when short, synthetic DNA oligonucleotides are used to analyze primer synthesis by the 63-kDa gene 4 protein, their binding to the helicase DNA-binding site could make them inaccessible to the distal primase active site (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence, the tight binding of DNA to the helicase domain masks the analysis of weaker interactions of DNA with the primase domain.Here, we present an analysis of oligoribonucleotide synthesis by the T7 primase fragment to understand how the primase synthesizes oligoribonucleotides only at specific DNA sequences called “primase recognition sites.” We first determine minimum template requirements for sequence-specific DNA binding by the primase fragment. We show that upon binding a recognition sequence, the primase synthesizes oligoribonucleotides in a template-directed manner. The deoxynucleotides at the 5′-end of the recognition sequence are used to dictate the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide, which occurs in the antiparallel direction from 5′ to 3′. A conserved dC at the 3′-end of the recognition sequence is essential for DNA binding but does not serve as a template. The roles of the NTP precursors in sequence-specific DNA binding by the primase fragment are also defined. These studies uncover important protein-DNA interactions previously masked by the tight binding between DNA and the helicase domain of T7 gene 4 protein. Once bound to a primase recognition site, the T7 primase rapidly synthesizes oligoribonucleotides from NTPs. A detailed analysis of the selective binding of NTPs by the primase and its subsequent oligoribonucleotide synthesis is presented in the accompanying paper (28Frick D.N. Kumar S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35899-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).RESULTSIn reactions requiring ATP, CTP, and a ssDNA template, the T7 gene 4 protein synthesizes short oligoribonucleotides for use as primers by T7 DNA polymerase (14Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oligoribonucleotides used as primers are mainly tetramers of the sequence pppACCA and pppACCC (33Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Morelli G. Seiffert D. Yuki A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10483-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pppACAC (35Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9831-9839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, with ΦX174 DNA as a template, primers are synthesized at 13 majors primase recognition sites that each share the sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′ or 5′-TGGTC-3 (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The gene 4 primase also synthesizes primers with the sequences 5′-(A/C)GGTC-3′ and 5′-NTGTC-3′ on natural ssDNA templates, albeit less frequently (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Each of the primase recognition sites contains a core trinucleotide sequence 5′-GTC-3′, which is sufficient to support the synthesis of the dinucleotide pppAC (31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis begins with this dinucleotide at the dT in the recognition sequence, and all primers start with pppA at the 5′ terminus (14Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10483-10489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytosine in the recognition sequence, although essential, is not copied into the primer and hence is designated as “cryptic” (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Mendelman L.V. Kuimelis R.G. McLaughlin L.W. Richardson C.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Studies using synthetic DNA templates have suggested that in addition to the primase recognition site, the T7 primase requires flanking DNA sequences to catalyze optimal rates of oligoribonucleotide synthesis (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It remains unclear whether these template requirements stem from direct interactions of the ssDNA with the primase active site or from interaction of ssDNA with the helicase domain of the T7 gene 4 protein. Therefore, the template requirements of the T7 primase were re-examined using the primase fragment of the T7 gene 4 protein. This fragment lacks helicase but retains primase activity (24Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and thus reveals only protein-DNA interactions that are essential for oligoribonucleotide synthesis.Minimum Template Requirements for Oligoribonucleotide Synthesis Catalyzed by the T7 Gene 4 Primase FragmentFig. 1 shows the products of oligonucleotide synthesis reactions containing ATP, [α-32P]CTP, the primase fragment, and various concentrations of several different DNA templates. The reaction products were separated from [α-32P]CTP on a polyacrylamide gel. The first three templates shown, 5′-GGGTC-3′ (lanes 1–5), 5′-TGGTC-3′ (lanes 6–10), and 5′-GTGTC-3′ (lane 11–15), are composed of the sequences at which the majority of primers are synthesized by the gene 4 primase on ΦX174 (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or M13 DNA (39Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth template, 5′-TTGTC-3′ (lanes 16–20), is the sequence of a secondary site found on these templates. Pentanucleotides are the minimum DNA template required for the synthesis of tetraribonucleotides by the T7 primase because, in addition to the four 5′-nucleotides encoding the oligoribonucleotide, they contain the essential 3′ cryptic C. In the presence of these pentanucleotide templates, the primase fragment catalyzes the synthesis of di-, tri-, and tetraribonucleotides, and the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis is dependent on the template concentration (Fig. 1).Like the primase fragment, the full-length protein is capable of synthesizing oligoribonucleotides given a 5-nucleotide-long DNA template containing a primase recognition site but only at high DNA concentrations (>50 μm) in the absence of dTTP. These data contrast with earlier reports (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to the fact that the previous studies used the 63-kDa gene 4 protein and a lower concentration (1 μm) of DNA template or that a low rate of synthesis was out of the range of detection (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that at low DNA concentrations, the majority of these short DNA templates are bound tightly at the helicase active site and are inaccessible to the primase active site (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The previous assays were carried out in the presence of dTTP (31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or its nonhydrolyzable analogue β,γ-methylene-dTTP (27Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), both of which dramatically increase the affinity of the T7 helicase for DNA (25Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12478-12487Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).From the data in Fig. 1, we can conclude that the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides by T7 primase requires DNA and the rate of synthesis is dependent on template concentration. No synthesis occurs in the absence of added template. Thus, the gene 4 protein does not synthesize oligoribonucleotides in the absence of template and does not use these oligonucleotides to locate primase recognition sites on DNA. Moreover, the incorporation of ribonucleotides is template-directed as confirmed by the fact that different oligoribonucleotides are synthesized in the presence of different templates. Oligoribonucleotides containing AMP or CMP have different mobilities in the 25% acrylamide gels used to separate the products of the primase reactions. Oligoribonucleotides containing AMP migrate slightly more slowly than the same length oligoribonucleotides containing CMP. Hence, the trinucleotide pppACA migrates more slowly than the trinucleotide pppACC. The trinucleotide pppACC is synthesized in reactions containing the templates 5′-GGGTC-3′, 5′-TGGTC-3′, whereas the trinucleotide pppACA is synthesized in reactions containing 5′-GTGTC-3′ and 5′-TTGTC-3′. Likewise, the tetranucleotide pppACAA migrates more slowly than pppACAC, which is equivalent to pppACCA in molecular weight. The tetranucleotide having the lowest molecular weight, pppACCC, migrates the most rapidly. The tetranucleotide pppACCC is synthesized in the presence of the recognition sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′; pppACCA is synthesized at 5′-TGGTC-3′; pppACAC is synthesized at 5′-GTGTC-3′; and pppACAA is synthesized at 5′-TTGTC-3′.Effect of Nucleotides Flanking the 3′-End of the Primase Recognition SiteOligoribonucleotide synthesis catalyzed by the primase fragment in the presence of pentanucleotide templates (Fig. 1,lanes 1–20) shows that a template comprised of only a primase recognition site is necessary and sufficient to support the oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The DNA flanking these primase recognition sites may also affect the rate of oligonucleotide synthesis. Like the cryptic C, these nucleotides need not be used to direct oligoribonucleotide synthesis but may instead interact with the enzyme to stabilize the DNA in the active site. Previously, it was observed that DNA templates with less then 15 nucleotides flanking the 3′-end of the primase recognition site less efficiently support oligoribonucleotide synthesis by the full-length 63-kDa gene 4 protein (37Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, because these earlier studies were all carried out in the presence of dTTP, the energy source for helicase activity, the requirement for flanking sequences may stem from interactions between the DNA template and the helicase domain of the gene 4 protein. It was important then to re-examine the primase template requirement using the primase fragment, which lacks helicase activity.After screening a variety of DNA template (see Table II), a dramatic stimulation of primase fragment catalyzed oligoribonucleotide synthesis was observed when nucleotides were added to the 3′-end of the primase recognition site. This effect is illustrated by the final sets of reactions shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 21–30). Lanes 21–25 show the products of reactions containing the template 5′-GGGTCA-3′, and lanes 26–30 shows the products of reactions containing the template 5′-GGGTCAA-3′. The same di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide products are produced in reactions containing 5′-GGGTCA-3′ and 5′-GGGTCAA-3′ as are produced with the sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′ (Fig. 1, lanes 1–5). This result demonstrates that, like the cryptic C, these nucleotides are not copied into the oligoribonucleotide primer. All oligoribonucleotide products begin opposite the dT recognition sequence with the dinucleotide pppAC.In addition to enhancing the rate of primer synthesis, the presence of the 3′-nucleotides allows for the synthesis of a pentanucleotide. The template DNA does not strictly encode this additional nucleotide, as evidenced by the fact that both pppACCCC and pppACCCA are synthesized. However, more pentanucleotide pppACCC is synthesized, suggesting that this phenomenon may be due to the slippage of the primase along the template strand. If such slippage occurs, then the incoming CTP would base pair with the template dG. This pentamer synthesis may be similar to the effect seen when the 56-kDa gene 4 protein is added to 63-kDa protein to stimulate the synthesis of “pseudo-templated” pppACCCC pentamers at the recognition sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′ (31Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Kinetic Constants Describing the Binding of the T7 Primase to Template DNAThe fact that the presence of two nucleotides flanking the 3′-end of the primase recognition site enhances the rate of primer synthesis suggests that the role of the additional nucleotides is to stabilize the template in the primase active site. To test this hypothesis, we tried to estimate the K d of the enzyme for DNA by comparing the rates of oligoribonucleotide synthesis in the presence of different concentrations of DNA templates. The amount of each reaction product was measured by phosphorimage analysis taking into account the number of labeled nucleotides in each oligoribonucleotide. Such an analysis of the data in Fig. 1 reveals that the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis is dependent on the concentration of template and that the relative amounts of each product depend on the sequence of the template. For example, the majority of the nucleotides (68%) are incorporated into tetramers in the presence of templates containing the primase recognition sites 5′-GGGTC-3′ (lanes 1–5 and 21–30), whereas in the presence of other templates such as 5′-TTGTC-3′ (lanes 16–20) the primase fragment incorporates 70% of the nucleotides into dinucleotides. Because tetramers, but not dimers, function as primers in DNA synthesis (40Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12446-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), this observation could explain why secondary primase recognition sites such as 5′-TTGTC-3′ are not used frequently to prime DNA synthesis on natural DNA templates (12Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the amounts and ratios of the various oligoribonucleotide products is presented in the accompanying paper (28Frick D.N. Kumar S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35899-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, the rates of primer synthesis will be reported simply as the total amounts of nucleotides incorporated into all of the products per unit time. The rates reflect the fact that one phosphodiester bond is formed per dimer, two bonds are formed per trinucleotide, and three bonds are formed per tetranucleotide product. All rates in this study were obtained under conditions where the rate of product formation was linear with both time and enzyme concentration, and less than 20% of [α-32P]CTP was consumed.The data in Fig. 1 were insufficient to determine kinetic constants because too few template concentrations were analyzed. Consequently, the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis was measured at many additional concentrations of the three most interesting templates: 5′-GGGTC-3′, 5′-GGGTCA-3′, and 5′-GGGTCAA-3′(Fig. 2). The rate of the primase reaction is clearly dependent on the concentration of DNA and was fit to the concentration of DNA template to yield aV max and K m for DNA (K DNA) using the following equation. v=Vmax[DNA]KDNA+[DNA](Eq. 1) For each template, nonlinear regression analysis was used to fit the data to Equation 1 using initial estimates ofK DNA and V max obtained from a double-reciprocal plot of 1/v versus 1/DNA (41Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7931) Google Scholar). The calculated curve fits produced using the computer program Enzyme Kinetics (Trinity Software) are shown along with the data in Fig. 2. A catalytic efficiency for the enzyme in the presence of each of the DNA template was also calculated, and the resulting kinetic constants are summarized in Table I. If the K DNA approximates the equilibrium dissociation constant for the enzyme and DNA, then the data in Table Isuggest that the two template 5′-GGGTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTCA-3′ bind the enzyme with similar affinities. However, the addition of a single 3′-nucleotide increases the maximum rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis 3.8-fold. The template containing a second 3′-nucleotide binds the enzyme dramatically more tightly with a K DNA of 10 μm.FIG. 2Effect of nucleotides flanking the 3′-end primase recognition site on the rate of oligonucleotide synthesis.Oligonucleotide synthesis reactions were performed at 23 °C for 30 min in the presence of 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm [α-32P]CTP (100 Ci/mol), 50 nm primase fragment, and DNA templates ranging from 0.6 to 310 μm. Rates of incorporation of [32P]CMP into oligoribonucleotides (pmol of CMP/min/pmol of enzyme) were calculated by measuring the amount of each product after separation on a 25% polyacrylamide gel containing 3 m urea using a BAS Fuju BAS 1000 Bio-imaging analyzer. The sequence of the DNA templates were 5′-GGGTC-3′ (○), 5′-GGGTCA-3′ (▪), and 5′-GGGTCAA (■).

To further define the template requirements for the primase, we have compared the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis at saturating levels of the template 5′-GGGTCAA-3′ with rate of synthesis in the presence of the same concentration of other DNA templates. The results are presented in Table II. In the presence of oligonucleotides containing only a primase recognition site (oligos 2–5 in Table II), the rate of primer synthesis is 5–32-fold lower than the synthesis in the presence of 5′-GGGTCAA-3′.

Simultaneous measurements of electrical activity and intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] i ) in GH3B6 pituitary cells confirmed the dependence of [Ca2+] i on action potential (AP) firing (1Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These cells express T-type and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels (VGCCs), tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+channels, and several voltage-gated and Ca2+-controlled K+ channels, which are all involved in the spontaneous firing of APs (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, T-type Ca2+ channels, and dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels control the slow pacemaker depolarization and drive the rapid depolarizing phase of APs. On the other hand, several K+ channels control the repolarization phase of APs, including delayed rectifier, BK, and SK channels (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Kwiecien R. Hammond C. Neuroendocrinology. 1998; 68: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Li Y.-X. Rinzel J. Vergara L. Stojilkovic S.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The transient opening of VGCCs may provide a window for the coupling of electrical activity to calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) through ryanodine receptor channels (RyR) (7Wagner K.A. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In line with this, a caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool (14Tanaka Y. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12062-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the cADP ribose-dependent signaling pathway were identified in these cells (15Koshiyama H. Lee H.C. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the plasma membrane oscillator in immortalized pituitary cells resembles the one that is operative in cardiac and some neuronal cells (16Sham J.S.K. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Poenie M. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y.

Neuron. 1992; 8: 1109-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).At the present time, however, it is not clear to what extent the native anterior pituitary cells differ from the immortalized cells. For example, Kwiecien et al. (19Kwiecien R. Tseeb V. Kurchikov A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that cultured somatotrophs behave only as “conditional pacemakers.” In other words, these cells are quiescent, and the addition of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is required to initiate firing. This is in contrast with the results by Sims et al. (20Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 615-637Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Hollet al. (21Holl R.W.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9682-9685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who observed spontaneous firing of APs and extracellular Ca2+-dependent fluctuation in [Ca2+] i in a fraction of somatotrophs. Several laboratories have also reported that gonadotrophs, lactotrophs, and corticotrophs exhibit periods of spontaneous firing of APs (22Sankaranarayanan S. Simasko S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1927-C1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Stojilkovic S.S. Kukuljan M. Iida T. Rojas E. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Childs G.V. Ritchie A.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3925-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In gonadotrophs, voltage-gated Ca2+ influx forms membrane-localized [Ca2+] i signals, which are not sufficient to trigger gonadotropin secretion (13Li Y.-X. Rinzel J. Vergara L. Stojilkovic S.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Basal ACTH, TSH, and FSH secretion are also low and are unaffected by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. In contrast, basal GH and prolactin secretions are high and controlled by spontaneous Ca2+influx through L-type Ca2+ channels (26Stojilkovic S.S. Izumi S. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13054-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since all these cells exhibit spontaneous firing of APs (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), these observations raised the possibility that AP-driven Ca2+ signals in somatotrophs and lactotrophs, but not in other pituitary cells, are coupled to CICR, leading to the generation of global [Ca2+] i signals sufficient to trigger exocytosis. Here we studied the nature of Ca2+ influx-dependent [Ca2+] i transients in somatotrophs and their relevance in growth hormone secretion.DISCUSSIONOscillations in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+] i transients) can result from inositol trisphosphate-induced release of intracellularly stored Ca2+ and/or from voltage-gated and voltage-insensitive Ca2+ influxes. The first type of [Ca2+] i transients is well characterized in a number of non-excitable and excitable cells, including hepatocytes, acinar cells, oocytes, and pituitary gonadotrophs (23Stojilkovic S.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1363-1366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium-mobilizing agonist-induced [Ca2+] i oscillations do not occur synchronously within the cell but originate from a specific sub-plasma membrane locus and propagate throughout the cell (41Rooney T.A. Sass E.J. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including the nucleoplasm. The equilibrium between cytoplasmic and nuclear [Ca2+] is probably achieved by the release of Ca2+ from nuclear envelope in synchrony with its release from endoplasmic reticulum (42Lin C. Hajnoczky G. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Al-Mohanna F.A. Caddy K.W.T. Bolsver S.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 44O'Malley D.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5741-5758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In cells exhibiting spontaneous- or receptor-controlled firing of APs, changes in plasma membrane potential can trigger Ca2+influx through VGCCs. Since the activation of these channels is limited by the duration of depolarization, AP-driven Ca2+ signals are usually localized events that are relevant in the control of plasma membrane-associated cellular functions, such as excitability and neurotransmission (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, in cells expressing RyRs these localized signals may also trigger CICR from intracellular stores, leading to the formation of global Ca2+ signals (17Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Poenie M. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 355-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 18Friel D.D. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1109-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, both calcium-mobilizing receptors and APs can generate local and global Ca2+ signals and propagation of Ca2+signals throughout the cell is coupled to release of Ca2+from intracellular stores.Here we show that somatotrophs are able to generate spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients, with single spikes lasting for several seconds. The elevations in [Ca2+] i were detected in all regions of the cytoplasm, as well as in the nucleoplasm, indicating the global nature of [Ca2+] i transients. In the non-normalized images, Ca2+ signal appeared to initiate in nucleoplasm and to terminate in cytoplasm. However, the extended time scale analysis ofF/F 0 profiles revealed that the rise in [Ca2+] i occurred almost simultaneously in cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic regions. Also, [Ca2+] i profiles in all monitored cell regions were highly comparable, suggesting that they were driven by the same mechanism. The apparent amplitudes of the Ca2+ signals, expressed as F/F 0 were similar throughout the cytoplasm, including the sub-plasma membrane region, and were higher in the nucleoplasm. These differences should be taken with reservation, because of the controversies in comparing signals originating from different cellular compartments (43Al-Mohanna F.A. Caddy K.W.T. Bolsver S.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 44O'Malley D.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5741-5758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Perez-Terzic C. Stehno-Bittel L. Clapham D.E. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of difference in the amplitude of [Ca2+] i responses close to the plasma membrane and in the central cytoplasmic regions does not rule out the existence of highly localized [Ca2+] i elevations in sub-plasma membrane regions, since the resolution of our measurements may not be sufficient to detect such changes.High amplitude spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients are not unique for somatotrophs, as immortalized pituitary cells also exhibit such changes (1Schlegel W.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2056-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) is consistent with the coupling of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx to CICR in native pituitary cells as well. In further parallelism with immortalized cells, spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients in somatotrophs were affected by high concentration of dihydropyridines, Cd2+, and Ni2+. Others have reported about the expression of VGCCs and participation of voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in spontaneous and GHRH-controlled electrical activity in somatotrophs (19Kwiecien R. Tseeb V. Kurchikov A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and GC somatotroph lines (3Kwiecien R. Robert C. Cannon R. Vigues S. Arnoux A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 883-905Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar).However, the present data indicate that spontaneous electrical activity in somatotrophs is not coupled to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The lack of CICR in somatotrophs was documented by the inability of two modulators of RyRs, caffeine and ryanodine (33Ehrlich B.E. Kaftan E. Bezprozvannaya S. Bezprozvanny I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), to initiate [Ca2+] i transients in quiescent cells and/or to alter the pattern of signaling in spontaneously active cells. Also, spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients were observed in cells treated with thapsigargin and ionomycin, showing that the plasma membrane oscillator is operative even upon the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ pools. Finally, in contrast to hippocampal neurons (48Jacobs J.M. Meyer T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4129-4135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), depolarization of somatotrophs bathed in Ca2+-deficient medium did not generate Ca2+signaling, arguing against the operation of a voltage sensor in these cells. Thus, voltage-gated Ca2+ influx is able to generate high amplitude [Ca2+] i oscillations without the integration of a Ca2+ release mechanism.The dependence of spontaneous [Ca2+] i transients on voltage-gated Ca2+ influx and their independence on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores implies a prolonged opening of VGCCs, presumably by a sustained activation of a depolarizing current needed to oppose the K+channel-mediated repolarization of the cells. The expression of depolarizing T-type Ca2+ and TTX-sensitive Na+channels in somatotrophs (49Lewis D.L. Goodman M.B. St. John P.A. Barker J.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 50Chen C. Clarke I.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E204-E212PubMed Google Scholar) could provide a transient but not a prolonged depolarization of cells, because of their rapid and voltage-dependent inactivation (51Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1991Google Scholar). Earlier studies have indicated the TTX-insensitive Na+ dependence of spontaneous [Ca2+] i oscillations in GH tumor somatotrophs (3Kwiecien R. Robert C. Cannon R. Vigues S. Arnoux A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 883-905Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Also, GHRH-induced electrical activity and Ca2+signaling are dependent on extracellular Na+ (20Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 615-637Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Lussier B.T. French M.B. Moor B.C. Kraicer J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 52Naumov A.P. Herrington J. Hille B. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 427: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In parallel to this, here we show that a substitution of Na+ with NMDG leads to a temporal suppression of spontaneous [Ca2+] i oscillations in cultured somatotrophs. The transient nature of inhibition of spontaneous [Ca2+] i oscillations by NMDG further suggests that this compound or other ion(s) can substitute for Na+. That is consistent with the role of a non-selective ion channel in generating spontaneous [Ca2+] i oscillations.A number of channel subtypes are non-selective and can generate the pacemaking depolarizing currents, including CNGs that conduct Na+, Ca2+, and K+ (34Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Three lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the rod type of CNGs function as non-selective cationic channels in spontaneously active somatotrophs. First, [Ca2+] i transients in somatotrophs are inhibited by divalent cations in concentrations that inhibit CNGs as well. Second, the specific PCR product of rod type CNGs was obtained from highly purified somatotrophs. Third, GHRH initiated spiking in quiescent cells and increased the frequency of oscillations in spontaneously active somatotrophs, as well as increased the production of two messengers needed for the activation of CNG channels, cAMP and cGMP. However, to confirm the role of CNGs in the formation of [Ca2+] i transients, additional experiments are required, including electrophysiological characterization of CNG current, the use of specific intracellular blockers, such asl-Cys-diltiazem, and Western blot analysis.In conclusion, the presented results demonstrate that a plasma membrane Ca2+ oscillator is operative in somatotrophs and is capable of generating spontaneous high amplitude Ca2+ signals. Although there is no coupling of electrical activity to intracellular Ca2+ release, this oscillator induces global Ca2+ signals. The results further suggest the physiological relevance of the spontaneous activity in the control of basal GH secretion. The operation of plasma membrane Ca2+ oscillator in somatotrophs is dependent on TTX-insensitive Na+conductance and voltage-gated Ca2+ influx. The oscillatory activity was inhibited by a high concentration of divalent cations, indicating a role of CNGs in pacemaker activity. Furthermore, the specific messages for these channels were identified in pituitary cells. In agreement with the hypothesis that cyclic nucleotides are intracellular messengers controlling the plasma membrane Ca2+ oscillator activity, GHRH, an agonist that signals through adenylyl and guanlylyl cyclase pathways, initiated [Ca2+] i spiking in quiescent cells and increased the frequency of spiking in spontaneously active cells. The immortalized GH,1 GS, AtT-20, and αT3 pituitary cells have been frequently used as cell models for the characterization of electrical activity and the associated Ca2+ signaling in lactotrophs, somatotrophs, corticotrophs, and gonadotrophs, respectively (1Schlegel W.

Simultaneous measurements of electrical activity and intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+] i ) in GH3B6 pituitary cells confirmed the dependence of [Ca2+] i on action potential (AP) firing (1Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These cells express T-type and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+channels (VGCCs), tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+channels, and several voltage-gated and Ca2+-controlled K+ channels, which are all involved in the spontaneous firing of APs (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, TTX-sensitive Na+ channels, T-type Ca2+ channels, and dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels control the slow pacemaker depolarization and drive the rapid depolarizing phase of APs. On the other hand, several K+ channels control the repolarization phase of APs, including delayed rectifier, BK, and SK channels (11Stojilkovic S.S. Catt K.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 256-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Kwiecien R. Hammond C. Neuroendocrinology. 1998; 68: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Li Y.-X. Rinzel J. Vergara L. Stojilkovic S.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The transient opening of VGCCs may provide a window for the coupling of electrical activity to calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) through ryanodine receptor channels (RyR) (7Wagner K.A. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In line with this, a caffeine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ pool (14Tanaka Y. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12062-12073Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the cADP ribose-dependent signaling pathway were identified in these cells (15Koshiyama H. Lee H.C. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16985-16988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the plasma membrane oscillator in immortalized pituitary cells resembles the one that is operative in cardiac and some neuronal cells (16Sham J.S.K. Cleemann L. Morad M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Lipscombe D. Madison D.V. Poenie M. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y.

At the present time, however, it is not clear to what extent the native anterior pituitary cells differ from the immortalized cells. For example, Kwiecien et al. (19Kwiecien R. Tseeb V. Kurchikov A. Kordon C. Hammond C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 613-623Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that cultured somatotrophs behave only as “conditional pacemakers.” In other words, these cells are quiescent, and the addition of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is required to initiate firing. This is in contrast with the results by Sims et al. (20Sims S.M. Lussier B.T. Kraicer J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 441: 615-637Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and Hollet al. (21Holl R.W.

There has recently been some renewed interest in the reversible inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by the nitric oxide radical (NO) (1Cleeter M.J.W. Cooper J.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Moncada S.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This has been motivated by the possibility that NO might modulate cytochrome c oxidase activity in vivo, perhaps even under normal physiological conditions as well as in pathological circumstances (6Wilson M.T. Torres J. Cooper C.E. Sharpe M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 9Sarti P. Lendaro E. Ippoliti R. Bellelli A. Benedetti P.A. Brunori M.

Carreras M.C. Radisic M. Schöpfer F Cadenas E. Boveris A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C112-C119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the related consideration of the confounding role that the peroxynitrite anion (ONO2−) might play in regulation of this activity has received comparatively little detailed attention. This is an important issue, for if cytochrome c oxidase is inhibited by NO in the presence of significant levels of oxygen, there are at least two unavoidable and seemingly undesirable consequences. First, direct reaction of dioxygen with either NADH dehydrogenase or reduced ubiquinone leads to the production of superoxide anion (13Turrens J.F. Beconi M. Barilla J. Chavez U.B. McCord J.M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1991; 12–13: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and this reaction will clearly be enhanced when the terminal oxidase is inhibited. Second, superoxide undergoes a near-diffusion-limited reaction with unbound NO to generate ONO2− (14Huie R.E. Padmaja S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1993; 18: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Consequently, in vivo, if cytochrome c oxidase is inhibited by NO in the presence of significant levels of oxygen, one probably cannot avoid an increase in the nonenzymatic formation of ONO2−. This is problematic, for if there is not some mechanism for the safe removal of this species, a large number of undesirable cytotoxic events will occur (15Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 16Beckman J.S. Nitric Oxide: Principles and Actions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 1-82Crossref Google Scholar, 17Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Knowles R.G. Biochem. Soc.

Trans. 1997; 25: 901-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In an effort to begin addressing this problem, we have undertaken an investigation of the functional and electronic spectral changes observable for air-oxidized and dithionite-reduced forms of cytochromec and cytochrome c oxidase following their reaction with ONO2−. Although it is apparent from a recent study by Sharpe and Cooper (20Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that very high levels of ONO2− irreversibly inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and may degrade the cofactors present, it is less clear how stoichiometric and substoichiometric amounts of ONO2−, i.e. more physiologically relevant levels, affect the enzyme. In this investigation we have examined the products of the reactions involving low levels of ONO2− with ferrocytochrome c and reduced cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase (respiratory complex IV) was prepared from beef heart as described previously (method 2) (21Holm D.E. Godette G. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Boatright D.M. Pearce L.L. Peterson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 114B: 345-352Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystalline, bovine cytochrome c was obtained from Sigma (type III) and used without further purification. Lauryl maltoside was obtained from Anatrace. Stable, hydrogen peroxide-free, alkaline (pH ∼12) solutions of sodium peroxynitrite were prepared following the recommendations of Beckman et al. (22Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) using ACS Certified reagents supplied by Aldrich and/or Fisher. Sodium dithionite was obtained from EM Science and used under anaerobic conditions to make up solutions volumetrically, employing the manufacturer's assay (93%) to calculate dithionite ion concentration. Concentrations of cytochromec oxidase, ferrocytochrome c, and peroxynitrite were determined using, respectively, the extinction coefficients Δε604 = 24 mm−1cm−1 (reduced minus oxidized, total heme) (23Van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 118: 36-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ε550 = 28 mm−1 cm−1(24Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and ε302 = 1.67 mm−1cm−1 (25Hughes M.N. Nicklin H.G. J. Chem. Soc. 1968; : 450-452Crossref Google Scholar). Determinations of nitrite ion concentration were performed by a modification of the method of Greiss (26Granger D.L. Taintor R.R. Bookvar K. Hibbs Jr., J.B. Everse J. Grisham M.B. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 7. Academic Press, New York1995: 78-82Google Scholar). First, protein was precipitated by heating aqueous solutions to near boiling and removed by centrifugation. Next, 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of the Greiss reagent (0.1%N-(1-napthyl)ethylenediamine hydrochloride, freshly mixed with an equal volume of 1.0% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid). Nitrite concentrations were then determined colorimetrically at 550 nm by comparison with a sodium nitrite standard curve. Ferrocytochrome c:O2 oxidoreductase activity was determined employing the high ionic strength conditions of Sinjorgo et al. (27Sinjorgo K.M.C. Durak I. Dekker H.L. Edel C.M. Hakvoort T.B.M. van Gelder B.F. Muijsers A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation of cytochromec and the subunits of its oxidase was performed according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Following either slot or Western blotting onto nitrocellulose, formation of 3-nitrotyrosine was observed by an immunochemical staining procedure employing a nitrotyrosine polyclonal antibody purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (29Beckman J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P. Chen J. Accavetti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Anaerobic conditions were achieved by gently blowing argon over the top of solutions at room temperature for 10–15 min, with mild agitation. In the case of experiments where cytochrome coxidase is initially reduced, the solution can be thought of as containing an intrinsic scrubbing system, able to further scavenge any oxygen that might otherwise be present (see “Results”). Anaerobic samples were maintained in glass vessels closed with rubber septa. Quantitative transfers of sodium dithionite and sodium peroxynitrite solutions were made with Hamilton gas-tight syringes fitted with new stainless steel needles that were used for one transfer or a single titration procedure, then discarded. At no time were solutions of these reagents left standing in contact with syringe needles. The pH of all protein samples was verified at the end of experiments to ensure that conditions had not become significantly more alkaline by additions of peroxynitrite solution. The position of the Soret band maximum observed in samples of beef heart cytochrome c oxidase (as prepared) is variable and depends upon a number of factors that are incompletely understood (30Palmer G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,31Hill B.C. Peterson J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The present maximum at 422 nm (Fig. 1, blue trace) is representative of the fully oxidized, resting (“slow” cyanide binding), monodispersed, 13-subunit “monomer” (21Holm D.E. Godette G. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Boatright D.M. Pearce L.L. Peterson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 114B: 345-352Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Holm D.E. Godette G. Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Peterson J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After the addition of a 50-fold excess of ONO2−over total heme (a + a 3) at pH 7–8.5, the Soret band sharpened, increased in intensity, and exhibited a new maximum at 426–427 nm (black trace). This species was unstable, however, persisting just long enough to permit the recording of its absorption spectrum. After a couple of minutes, the Soret band shifted to a new position at 418 nm (red trace), and the new derivative was stable for hours at room temperature. Although the difference between the spectrum of the resting enzyme and that of the second species obtained following ONO2−addition is clearly small, the result was entirely reproducible. The spectra of the peroxynitrite-treated derivatives were found to be the same if the spectrum of the starting enzyme exhibited a 424-nm Soret band (indicative of a pulsed or “fast” cyanide binding form, not shown). In contrast, the addition of 50-fold excesses of ONO2− to ferricytochrome csolutions at pH 7.4 resulted in no measurable change in the absorption spectrum of the hemoprotein. The functional characteristics of cytochrome c oxidase following treatment with excess peroxynitrite were clearly changed (Table I). The addition of up to a 50-fold excess of ONO2− to the enzyme resulted in a barely measurable change in electron transfer activity, whereas larger excesses of the oxidant over enzyme did lead to a significant reduction in the overall activity. The approximately 10–15% irreversible loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity following additions of ONO2− at less than 50-fold excesses is noteworthy, because this is the same magnitude as changes previously observed in submitochondrial particles (33Lizasoain I. Moro M.A. Knowles R.G. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Another function of the enzyme was also altered when it was exposed to 102-fold excesses of ONO2−; namely, the widely reported (34Bickar D. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Young L.J. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15019-15025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bonaventura C.

This demonstrates that the reaction with ONO2− involves modification of the oxygen binding heme a 3-CuB pair.Table IActivity assays of cytochrome c oxidase samples at 20 °CpHbThe ONO2− additions were made at pH 7.4 to all samples in exactly the same manner, quickly, with agitation.

Subsequently, where necessary, the pH was readjusted at the start of the activity assay procedure.c The quoted excesses are ONO2− added over total heme (a + a 3). For example, a typical experiment involved taking a solution of the enzyme 12 μm in total heme and adding peroxynitrite to a concentration of 60 μm, thereby achieving a 50-fold excess. Open table in a new tab One well documented reaction of proteins with peroxynitrite is the covalent modification of tyrosine residues to form nitrotyrosine (22Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). The results of a nitrotyrosine-sensitive immunostaining analysis showed clear evidence for the formation of nitrotyrosine in cytochromec samples exposed to both substoichiometric and excess amounts of peroxynitrite (Fig. 3,lanes C to E). Samples containing cytochromec oxidase, on the other hand, showed no evidence for the formation of nitrotyrosine (lane B) unless the oxidant was added in excess over the available reduced metal centers (lane A). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolution of peroxynitrite-treated cytochrome c oxidase into its subunits followed by Western blotting before the immunostaining (not shown) revealed that faint staining was mostly associated with subunits that do not contain the catalytic metal centers. The direct reaction between cytochrome c oxidase and sodium dithionite is quite slow. Consequently, it is impractical to attempt controlled reduction of the oxidase by dithionite without added cytochrome c to catalyze the electron transfer. Under anaerobic conditions, a 1:1 mixture of cytochromec:cytochrome c oxidase can be quantitatively reduced by a small excess (<5%) of sodium dithionite. The absorption spectrum of the solution (Fig. 4,broken line) is the simple sum of the individual spectra of the reduced hemoproteins; that is, there is no indication of any interaction between the cytochrome c and the oxidase hemes. Maintaining anaerobic conditions, the addition of a small excess (5–10%) of sodium peroxynitrite initially resulted in the formation of a metastable species exhibiting an absorption spectrum with a distinct double Soret feature (solid line). Interestingly, the lower energy feature appeared at ∼426 nm, very like the maximum observed after the addition of ONO2− to the oxidized enzyme. After a period of 1–2 min, still maintaining anaerobic conditions, the intermediate had disappeared, and the final spectrum (dotted line) was that of the air-stable enzyme, not like the final form (λmax = 418 nm) of Fig. 1. It should be noted that, provided anaerobic conditions were suitably maintained, it was routinely possible to quantitatively cycle between reduced and oxidized derivatives several times by alternate additions of dithionite, then ONO2−, with no visible indication (i.e. neither precipitation nor turbidity) of the proteins becoming denatured. The addition of ONO2− to ferrocytochromec in the absence of its oxidase also led to oxidation of the hemoprotein to ferricytochrome c (Fig. 5), but a larger excess of the oxidant was required. The spectrum of the ONO2−-oxidized derivative (solid trace) is identical to the published spectrum of the ferricyanide- or air-oxidized protein (24Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), including the unchanged appearance of the 695-nm band that is sensitive to changes in conformation and axial ligands to the heme (37Gadsby P.M.A. Peterson J. Foote N. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 246: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).FIG. 5Electronic absorption spectra at 22 °C, 1.0-cm path length. Shown are anaerobic samples of 7.9 μm cytochrome c in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, following the addition of sodium dithionite to 4.4 μm (broken line) and immediately following the subsequent addition of sodium peroxynitrite to 30 μm (solid line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 6 shows the results of an anaerobic titration of dithionite-reduced cytochrome c oxidase with ONO2− in the presence of ferrocytochrome c (▪). One molar equivalent of cytochromec was added to one molar equivalent of the oxidase (i.e. 2 molar equivalents of heme a +a 3). Next, dilute sodium dithionite solution was titrated into the solution until the cytochromes were just fully reduced, as determined by no further increases being observed in the measured absorbances at 550 and 604 nm. Subsequent oxidation of the cytochromes was monitored by following the decrease in absorbance at these same wavelengths. The mole fraction of ferricytochromec was calculated as 1-(A −A final)/(A initial −A final), taking the absorption measurements at 550 nm. The mole fraction of oxidized cytochrome c oxidase was calculated employing the same general expression but using absorption changes measured at 604 nm. In the axis legends, “redox centers” refers to the complete set of metalloprotein oxidation-reduction centers present in the mixture of cytochromes (i.e. heme c + CuA + hemea + heme a 3 + CuB). Thesolid line represents the theoretical relationship predicted for ONO2− behaving as a two-electron acceptor (e.g. ONO2− + 2H+ + 2e− → NO2− + H2O). In experiments where substoichiometric additions of the oxidant were made to reduced cytochrome c oxidase, subsequent nitrite determinations established that 0.86 equivalents (S.D., 0.05; n = 3) of the added ONO2− was measurably converted to nitrite ion. For comparison, the results of control titrations of ferrocytochrome c (alone) with ONO2− under aerobic (○) and anaerobic (●) conditions are also shown. The broken line represents the theoretical relationship predicted for ONO2− behaving as a one-electron acceptor (e.g. ONO2− + 2H+ + 1e− → NO + H2O2). It was possible to perform an experiment under aerobic conditions, because the direct reaction between ferrocytochrome c and molecular oxygen is slow. The pH at the beginning of these titrations was 7.4 and at the end 7.8. It was verified that the spectra of none of the species present exhibited any significant pH-dependent behavior in the relevant range. Clearly, ONO2− behaves as a two-electron acceptor toward ferrocytochrome c and reduced cytochrome c oxidase when they are present together. Moreover, the reaction is reasonably facile, at least faster than the uncatalyzed decomposition rate of ONO2−, the half-life of which is estimated to be ≤1 s at physiological pH, depending upon the particular buffer composition (16Beckman J.S. Nitric Oxide: Principles and Actions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 1-82Crossref Google Scholar, 22Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). It is also clear that ONO2− does not behave as a two-electron acceptor toward ferrocytochrome c in the absence of its oxidase. The negative divergence of the cytochrome c data from the theoretical line apparent in Fig. 6 shows an increased tendency of added ONO2− to isomerize to nitrate in solution as the available ferrocytochrome cbecomes depleted and ,therefore, indicates a slow reaction with the hemoprotein. Consequently, taken together, the titration data of Fig. 6demonstrate that cytochrome c oxidase actually catalyzes the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by ONO2−. Our current data concerning the consequences of the reaction between excess ONO2−and air-stable preparations of cytochrome c oxidase seem to be generally in accord with the findings of Sharpe and Cooper (20Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In both studies the addition of excess oxidant has been found to lead to distinct spectral changes and irreversible inhibition of electron-transfer activity. The rather subtle change observed in the electronic absorption spectrum following exposure to ONO2− (Fig. 1) is indicative of a structural modification in the vicinity of one or both hemes but probably not heme degradation, as the intensity of the band is maintained. The immunostaining results show that nitration of a tyrosine residue is apparently not the modification in question because subunit I, where the hemes are located, does not retain any immunoreactivity (data not shown). Complete inhibition of the CO-driven reduction reaction following exposure of the enzyme to ∼102-fold excesses of ONO2− (Fig. 2) clearly identifies the heme a 3-CuB pair as a modified site. Interestingly, however, treatment with this excess of oxidant merely results in partial loss of electron-transfer activity (Table I). The observation that these two functional characteristics exhibit distinguishable patterns of inhibition by ONO2− indicates that they are mediated by different structural factors. It follows that the reaction of the oxidized enzyme with ONO2− involves at least two structural modifications to subunit I. Only one of these need be a modification to the polypeptide chain; the other could be an ensuing conformational change. The marked pH dependence of the CO-driven reduction of cytochrome c oxidase as isolated has not previously been reported. At pH 8.4, a pronounced lag phase precedes any reduction, which then occurs significantly faster than at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2). A plausible explanation for the lag phase is that the reaction must involve an activation step (e.g. a conformational change in the active-site structure) before electron transfer from CO. The activation step is seemingly more readily achieved at pH 7.4 than 8.4. The half-reaction involving CO generates two protons (34Bickar D. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): CO + H2O → CO2 + 2H+ + 2e−. Consequently, it is reasonable to suggest that the accelerated CO-driven reduction rate observed under the more alkaline conditions is due to the presence of one or more basic groups able to assist in the abstraction of protons. Derivatization of any such group would then facilitate an explanation of the loss of CO-driven reduction activity following exposure to ONO2−. However, the present data is ambiguous in this matter, and the possibility that the effect of ONO2− modification is to produce a more stable, nonactivated conformation (i.e. the resulting lag phase is infinitely long) cannot be excluded. From the previous study of Sharpe and Cooper (20Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), it is clear that some limited NO production is observed when large amounts of ONO2− are presented to cytochrome c oxidase under turnover conditions. Only 0.75% of the total ONO2− added was detected as NO, and despite the addition of ONO2− to greater than 104-fold excess over the enzyme, there was still very substantial oxidase activity following the disappearance of NO (and ONO2−) from the assay solutions. Although it is certainly possible that cytochrome c oxidase could catalytically convert ONO2− to NO, there are other possible explanations for the production of this species. Adventitiously bound copper ions that are inevitably found in cytochrome c oxidase preparations (40Peterson J. Day E.P. Pearce L.L. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) generate NO-donor species when exposed to ONO2−and HEPES buffer (41Schmidt K. Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 859-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in agreement with Sharpe and Cooper (20Sharpe M.A. Cooper C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30961-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we have shown that greater than 102-fold excesses of ONO2− over the enzyme leads to a modification of the active site of cytochrome coxidase. This modified form of the enzyme could be responsible for the observed NO production. The titration data of Fig. 6 show that the reaction between ONO2− and reduced cytochromec oxidase in the presence of one equivalent of ferrocytochrome c is a two-electron process. This statement applies equally to the fully reduced enzyme and the various partly reduced majority species present at different stages of the titration. The observed increase in nitrite concentration (equivalent to 86% of the added ONO2−) is in good agreement with the electron count determined by the titration and suggests the half reaction involving ONO2− to be: ONO2− + 2H+ + 2e− → NO2− + H2O. Given the nature of the active site, namely, a binuclear pair, this appears to be a very reasonable result indeed. If there are additional minor side reactions involving one-electron processes, for example, the titration data requires that these account for less than about 5% of the total ONO2− consumed. During normal aerobic respiration, the electron-accepting substrate for cytochrome c oxidase is molecular oxygen. The question then arises as to the rate of the reaction of cytochrome coxidase with added ONO2− and how this reaction rate compares to that of the enzyme with its primary substrate, oxygen. Using available data from current as well as other studies enables us to calculate a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of the reaction velocity. At physiological pH, ONO2− has a half-life of ≤1 s; therefore, the first-order rate constant for its decomposition is given by k 1 ≥ ln(2/1) = 0.69 s−1. At approximately 10 μm cytochrome c oxidase concentrations and equimolar added ONO2−, all oxidant appeared to react with the protein cofactors. Assuming the reaction to be of second-order molecularity, this implies a lower limit on the catalyzed decomposition rate of 10 × 10−6m × 0.69 s−1 = 6.9 × 10−6ms−1. Therefore, the catalyzed decomposition is described by the rate-law inequality k 2 × [enzyme] × [ ONO2−] > 6.9 × 10−6ms−1. Typically, in the titration experiments, the enzyme concentration was ∼10 μm, and ONO2− additions were made to achieve instantaneous concentrations of ∼2 μm. It follows that the second-order rate constant for the reaction between reduced cytochrome c oxidase and ONO2− is given byk 2 > 6.9 × 10−6/(10−5 × 2 × 10−6) = 3.4 × 105m−1 s−1. In another experiment, a solution equimolar in cyanide and ONO2−(verified to be stable for several minutes by monitoring the absorption spectrum of the ONO2−) was added to a reduced cytochrome c oxidase solution to achieve a 10-fold excess of both cyanide and ONO2− over heme a 3. Oxidation of about 30% of the total cytochromes present was observed, indicating the rate of cyanide inhibition to be comparable to, but faster than, the reaction of the enzyme with ONO2−. The reported rate constants for the reaction of cyanide (as HCN) with the fully reduced and turnover enzyme are ∼102m−1s−1 and >106m−1s−1, respectively (38Jones M.G. Bickar D. Wilson M.T. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Sarti P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The former of these is clearly too slow to be relevant to the experiment in question. If the latter constant is taken to be applicable, it follows that the second-order rate constant for the reaction between partly reduced cytochromec oxidase and ONO2− is given by k 2 > (30/70) × 106 = 4.3 × 105m−1s−1. Based on this information, it is reasonable to argue that the rate constants for the reaction of ONO2− with fully and partly reduced cytochrome c oxidase are probably ≥∼106m−1 s−1 at ambient temperature and physiological pH. Although the reaction appears to proceed with moderate velocity, the second-order rate constant we estimate is still about 2 orders of magnitude slower than that governing the reaction between the enzyme and oxygen (39Wilson M.T. Peterson J. Antonini E. Brunori M. Colosimo A. Wyman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7115-7118Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of unambiguous evidence to the contrary, one should expect oxygen to be an effective inhibitor of the reaction between ONO2− and reduced cytochrome c oxidase. Although some questions may persist regarding the products of the reaction, it is clear that cytochrome c oxidase can function as a peroxynitrite reductase in vitro. There are several interrelated issues that must be addressed before a firm conclusion can be drawn as to the possible physiological significance of this reaction. The kinetics of the reaction need to be investigated by rapid-mixing experiments, the inhibitory effects of oxygen more completely delineated, and the relevant rate constants for these processes measured. The results of such studies should facilitate a reasonable assessment of the likely relevance of the demonstrated peroxynitrite reductase activity to normal mitochondrial function in vivo. Radi et al. (42Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and Cassina and Radi (43Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) previously argued that, in situ, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is not affected by ONO2−, and the present data are in accord with this position. Provided that reduced forms remain in excess, the micellar enzyme protects itself, other protein, and detergent molecules from ONO2−, efficiently converting the oxidant to nitrite. It thus seems quite reasonable to suggest that, in the mitochondrion, cytochrome c oxidase is probably able to protect other inner membrane-associated components from ONO2−-induced damage. This would be a much less tenable hypothesis if NO, rather than NO2−, were the reaction product, because one would then be in the position of proposing the enzyme to be a detoxifying system displaying product inhibition. As ONO2− is rapidly formed in the uncatalyzed reaction between NO and the superoxide anion, it is conceivable that the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase could constitute a major pathway for the removal of both ONO2− and excess NO. Also, since the proposed “peroxynitrite reductase” activity of the enzyme catalyzes electron transfer from ferrocytochrome c, the reaction sustains the electron transport chain and, presumably, drives proton translocation. This latter notion is also supported by the observations of Radi et al. (42Radi R. Rodriguez M. Castro L. Telleri R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and Cassina and Radi (43Cassina A. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), who found no evidence for uncoupling in mitochondria exposed to ONO2−, even in situations where there clearly was evidence of some damage to the electron transport capabilities of respiratory complexes I and II. Finally, the present results may be of some relevance to the interpretation of experiments involving cultured cells and analysis of samples derived from clinical studies. For example, explanations of the reported synergistic cytotoxicity exhibited by NO and hyperoxia toward pulmonary cells (44Narula P. Xu J. Kazzaz J.A. Robbins C.G. Davis J.M. Horowitz S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L411-L416PubMed Google Scholar) should now take into account both elevated mitochondrial production of ONO2− and possible increased inhibition of its detoxification pathway in the presence of excess molecular oxygen. Recently, cells undergoing apoptosis have been shown to exhibit an increased rate of superoxide production following release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (45Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). This is a consequence of the supply of electrons to cytochrome c oxidase having been interrupted, facilitating the direct reaction of oxygen with other species such as NADH dehydrogenase and reduced ubiquinone. Also, a nitric-oxide synthase located at the inner mitochondrial membrane has now been identified (46Giulivi G. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 47Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Consequently, if NO synthesis is not suppressed during the burst of superoxide associated with apoptotic-like cell death, elevated ONO2− levels will result, because the oxidant cannot be reduced by cytochrome c oxidase trapped in the fully oxidized state. Therefore, an explanation of the intriguing observation that increased ONO2−production is evident in a wide range of clinical conditions (15Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 17Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may involve a chain of events following apoptosis."

Cell adhesion to the ECM generates signals important for cell growth, survival, and migration via interactions with integrins, a large family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity, which in different α/β combinations bind a variety of ECM target proteins. Integrins act not only as simple mediators of cell adhesion but are also involved in the transduction of biochemical signals across the cell membrane and the regulation of cellular functions (1Clark E.A.

In a variety of cell types, attachment of integrins to their ligands leads to a profound increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (2Guan J.L.

The precise mechanism that links integrin clustering to FAK activation and the role of FAK in integrin-regulated processes during development remains to be determined. However, the importance of FAK during development is clear from genetic studies in mice, in which a knockout of the FAK gene results in embryonic lethality (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Indeed, both FAK and fibronectin (FN) knockout mice die as a result of similar developmental gastrulation defects, indicating that FAK is able to transduce FN-initiated signals in vivo (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 24George E.L. Georges-Labouesse E.N. Patel-King R.S. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse fibroblasts from FAK−/− embryos exhibit an increased number of focal contact sites, a rounded morphology and decreased rates of cell migration in vitro (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for FAK in the process of cell migration. Furthermore, FAK overexpression in CHO cells enhances FN-stimulated cell motility, and this depends upon FAK autophosphorylation at Tyr397 (25Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.-L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 108: 1787-1794Google Scholar) and linkages to p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (26Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of FAK, FRNK, inhibits FN-stimulated cell spreading, inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of targets such as paxillin (27Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 28Richardson A. Shannon J.D. Adams R.B. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Biochem.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) possibly through displacement of FAK from focal contact sites. To learn more about the role of the FAK family of PTKs in vivo, we initiated a study in the D. melanogaster model system. The conserved nature of many receptor signaling systems inDrosophila suggests that integrin signaling will also be conserved. Drosophila appears to have a smaller number of integrin genes than vertebrates, with five subunits identified so far (30Brown N.H. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Gotwals P.J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Stark K.A. Hynes R.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) of which the best characterized are the position-specific (PS) integrins (32Brower D.L. Wilcox M. Piovant M. Smith R.J.

Development. 1989; 107: 891-897PubMed Google Scholar). These subunits form the PS1 (αPS1βPS) and PS2 (αPS2βPS) integrins, which are essential for the development of both larval and adult flies. In addition tomys, there is a second β-integrin, β-neu, which is expressed in the developing midgut (43Yee G.H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 118: 845-858PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the third identified α-integrin subunit,αPS3/volado , appears to be involved in movement and morphogenesis of tissues during development as well as the signaling events underlying short term memory formation (44Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D. Wu K.H. Zhu X.R. Davis R.L. Nature. 1998; 391: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,45Stark K.A. Yee G.H. Roote C.E. Williams E.L. Zusman S. Hynes R.O. Development. 1997; 124: 4583-4594PubMed Google Scholar). Using a degenerate PCR approach (46Lai C. Lemke G. Neuron. 1991; 6: 691-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), we have identified a homologue of mammalian FAK, DFak56. DFak56 is a 140-kDa PTK that has strong homology with both FAK and Pyk2. We show that DFak56 is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo, and that its phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) content is increased when cells are plated on the Drosophilatiggrin ECM component. We have utilized the UAS-GAL4 expression system to study DFak56 in vivo and observed that overexpression of DFak56 results in a range of phenotypes including wing blistering, a developmental phenotype induced by both loss of function and overexpression of the PS integrin. Standard Drosophila husbandry procedures were employed. Flies were raised and crossed at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. The wild type strain used was Canton-S. The W1118 strain was used for all microinjections described. Standard molecular biology protocols were used (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Degenerate PCR was performed using D. melanogaster tudor male and female cDNA as template. The following primers were used 5′, 5′-GGAATTCCAYCGNGAYYTNGCNGCNMG-3′ (HRDLAAR), and 3′, 5′-CCTCGAGAYNCCRWARSWCCANACRTC-3′ (DVWS(Y/F)G(I/V)). Sequencing data were collected using the dideoxy chain termination method using35S-dATP and the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals). Sequence was determined on both strands, and the resulting sequence data were compiled using the DNAStar and DNA Strider computer packages (48Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Homology searches were performed using the NCBI GenBankTM BLAST programs (49Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71432) Google Scholar). Screening of D. melanogaster tudor male and female libraries constructed in λZAP were performed using clone PE28, a product of the degenerate PCR reaction described above. The excised PE28 cDNA fragment was32P-labeled and used as probe. Multiple cDNAs were obtained, all of which were sequenced and none of which contained a complete open reading frame. A 5′ fragment of the longest clone was then employed as a probe and resulting positives were isolated and sequenced. A 4106-bp cDNA, clone 8.2, encoding the full DFak56 open reading frame is described and utilized in these studies. This clone contains a 72-bp 5′-untranslated region containing an upstream in-frame stop codon, a 3600-bp open reading frame, and 434 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. Genomic cosmid clones were isolated by standard techniques from a library containing DNA from the iso-1 line prepared by Tamkun et al. (50Tamkun J.W. Deuring R. Scott M.P. Kissinger M. Pattatucci A.M. Kaufman T.C. Kennison J.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 561-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). P1 genomic clones (51Kimmerly W. Stultz K. Lewis S. Lewis K. Lustre V. Romero R. Benke J. Sun D. Shirley G. Martin C. Palazzolo M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 414-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. Wild type embryos were fixed and immunostained (52Patel N.H. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 445-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) with rabbit affinity-purified primary antibodies against DFak56. Immunolocalization was visualized with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG and the avidin DH-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H complex using diaminobenzidine and H2O2 as substrate (Vector Lab) or fluorescent secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Imaginal discs from wandering third instar larvae were dissected, collected, and rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline prior to fixing in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 60 min. Imaginal discs were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, washed 3 × 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100, followed by overnight incubation in secondary antibody at 4 °C, and washed 3 × 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100. Imaginal discs were then mounted on polylysine coated coverslips prior to visualization by confocal microscopy. DFak56 cDNA was used to generate various P element transformants. The DFak56 transgenes used contained an N-terminally engineered triple hemagglutinin tag that was confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid pUAST:(HA3)DFak56(wild type), was constructed by subcloning the DFak56 cDNA into the pUAST vector (53Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P element transformation was performed by microinjection of pUAST:DFak56 together with a delta2.3 transposase containing plasmid into a W1118 D. melanogaster strain (54Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar, 55Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Multiple lines (>4) were obtained. To drive expression of these UAS constructs, several GAL4 enhancer lines were used. P[Engrailed-GAL4] and P[Actin5C-GAL4] inserts were used. In addition, we have used a clonally-inducible GAL4 line that combines the flippase/FRT system and the GAL4/UAS system resulting in the clonal expression of UAS-DFak56 under the Actin-5C promoter within wild type tissue. Female flies homozygous for Hsp70-flippase (insertion on the X chromosome) were crossed to males homozygous for both AyGal4 (insertion in the second chromosome) and UAS-GFP (also inserted on the second chromosome). Progeny from this cross were then crossed to homozygous UAS-DFak56 flies, and the resulting larvae were heat shocked for 30 min at 37 °C. Thus, DFak56 expressing clones induced in this system are marked by a UAS-GFP reporter (56Ito K. Awano W. Suzuki K. Hiromi Y. Yamamoto D. Development. 1997; 124: 761-771PubMed Google Scholar). DNA encoding DFak56 amino acids 881–1200 was subcloned into pGEX-KG to generate a 63-kDa C-terminal GST-DFak56 fusion protein. GST-DFak56 fusion protein was induced and purified from Escherichia coli [BL21(DE3)] bacterial lysates by standard protocols prior to proteolytic cleavage by thrombin. The resulting cleaved DFak56 recombinant protein was used for rabbit immunization. In addition, a peptide encoding the 10 C-terminal amino acids of DFak56 (residues CNTSALHGHA) was synthesized and used for rabbit immunization after coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the added N-terminal cysteine. Polyclonal antibodies against DFak56 were purified from the serum of rabbit numbers 5946 and 5953 (fusion protein) and numbers 6059 and 6060 (peptide) using a GST-DFak56 fusion protein affinity column. Unless stated otherwise, anti-DFak56 antibodies from rabbit number 5946 were used at 1:2000 dilution for immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. The 4G10 monoclonal antibody was used to detect Tyr(P). For transient transfections, we used the cytomegalovirus-based pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector. The coding sequences of DFak56 and DFak56(K513-R) (amino acids 1–1200) were subcloned into the 5′ KpnI and 3′ XbaI sites of pcDNA3. The pcDNA3:DFak56(K513-R) mutant of DFak56, in which Lys513 in the kinase subdomain II was replaced by Arg, was generated by QuikChangeTM mutagenesis (Stratagene) using oligonucleotides 5′-ATACAAGTGGCGATAAGGACATGTAAAGCTAAC-3′ and 5′-GTTAGCTTTACATGTCCTTATCGCCACTTG-3′ and verified by DNA sequencing. Human 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were lysed 36–48 h posttransfection, and the resulting cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and protein kinase assays. Embryos were collected and aged resulting in a 4–6-h-old embryo sample. Embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach, washed, followed by mild homogenization, filtering, and washing twice in Schneider medium. They were then grown for 24 h at room temperature in Schneider medium supplemented with 20 mIU/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). Good differentiation of these primary cell cultures was observed on tissue culture plates coated overnight with Drosophila laminin or tiggrin fusion proteins (57Gullberg D. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in 1 ml of RIPA extraction buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate) and cleared by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein per sample were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-DFak56 antibodies. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses, the immune complexes or proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and then blotted with primary and secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiography was carried out at −70 °C using X-OMAT AR (Kodak). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (58Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (59Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biology techniques were employed for DNA manipulation (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 4G10 monoclonal antibody was used to detect Tyr(P) in immunoblotting and immunostaining. To identify novel PTKs in D. melanogaster, we utilized a degenerate PCR-based approach (Fig. 1 A). Highly conserved residues within subdomains VIB and IX of known PTKs were targeted for degenerate PCR primer design (46Lai C. Lemke G. Neuron. 1991; 6: 691-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and multiple PCR products were obtained, identifying novel as well as previously described D. melanogaster PTKs. These included DSrc28 (60Gregory R.J. Kammermeyer K.L. Vincent W.S. Wadsworth S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), DSrc41 (61Takahashi F. Endo S.

Multiple cDNAs were obtained using the 204-bp PE28 PCR fragment as a probe for screening D. melanogaster adult cDNA libraries. We have named the locus identified using these resulting cDNAs DFak56 (see below). Fig. 1 C shows the complete amino acid sequence of full-length DFak56 cDNA clone 8.2. The DFak56 open reading frame predicts a 1200-amino acid, 135-kDa protein, with greatest similarity to FAK and Pyk2 (34 and 29% overall amino acid identity, respectively; 61 and 53% within the kinase domains) as well as a conserved overall structure (Fig. 1 D). DFak56, like FAK and Pyk2, has three domains, a central PTK domain flanked by N- and C-terminal regulatory domains. The kinase domain of DFak56 (Fig. 1 C, shaded) contains several sequence motifs conserved among PTKs, including the tripeptide motif DFG that is found in most protein kinases, and a consensus ATP-binding motif GXGXXG followed by an AXK sequence downstream (Fig. 1 C, underlined). Interestingly, DFak56 contains a 24-amino acid kinase insert (Fig. 1 C,bold and underlined) located between the phosphate anchor-containing kinase subdomain I and kinase subdomain II, a feature not found in either FAK or Pyk2. The N-terminal domain of DFak56 contains a YAEI consensus Src SH2 domain-binding sequence starting at Tyr430 (Fig. 1 C, boxed), identical to the YAEI motifs in FAK and Pyk2, which bind to the SH2 domain of mammalian Src when phosphorylated. A proline-rich region analogous to the first one in FAK is present in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1 C, boxed). DFak56 Tyr956 (Fig. 1 C, boxed) aligns with Tyr925 in FAK and Tyr881 in Pyk2, which are binding sites for the Grb2 SH2/SH3 adaptor protein, but Tyr956 lacks the Asn at position +2 needed for Grb2 SH2 domain binding. There is 35% amino acid identity between DFak56 and FAK in the focal adhesion targeting region (11Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Interestingly, further C-terminal to this potential focal adhesion targeting domain, DFak56 has a long C-terminal extension, which is absent in mammalian FAK and Pyk2. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes localized DFak56 to 56D on the second chromosome. Although no evidence exists at this point for another FAK family member in D. melanogaster, we have decided to call this novel FAK homologue DFak56, based on the chromosomal location of its gene, to simplify the literature in the future should one be discovered. Using the in situ mapping information, we have confirmed and further defined the genomic localization of DFak56 to region 56D5–7. In addition to mapping DFak56, we have carried out a careful characterization of this region (Fig. 1 E). The data here are derived from P1 genom"

NF-κB transcription factors are constitutively expressed in the nuclei of Sertoli cells in rodent testis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Sertoli NF-κB proteins specifically bind to κB enhancer motifs within the promoter of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) gene, an important mediator of hormonal signals that control spermatogenesis. Overexpression of NF-κB proteins in primary Sertoli and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells induced the CREB promoter in transient transfection assays. Stimulation of Sertoli cells with tumor necrosis factor-α, an NF-κB-activating cytokine produced by round spermatids located adjacent to Sertoli cells, stimulated the elimination of IκB, the translocation of additional NF-κB to the nucleus, and increased NF-κB binding to CREB promoter κB enhancer elements. Tumor necrosis factor-α also stimulated transcription from the CREB promoter. These data demonstrate that NF-κB contributes to the up-regulation of CREB expression in Sertoli cells and raises the possibility that NF-κB may induce other Sertoli genes required for spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the CREB promoter is also inducible by NF-κB in NIH 3T3 cells suggesting that NF-κB may be a general regulator of CREB in non-testis tissues.

In addition to germ cells at various developmental stages, the seminiferous tubules contain peritubular myoid cells, which line the outer wall of the tubule, and somatic Sertoli cells, which provide elements essential for germ cell maturation in response to endocrine and paracrine factors. The primary hormonal inputs regulating spermatogenesis are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)1 and luteinizing hormone (1Sharpe R.M. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 1363-1434Google Scholar, 2de Kretser D.M. Risbridger G.P. Kerr J. DeGroot L. Endocrinology, 3. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1995: 2307-2335Google Scholar). Luteinizing hormone stimulates testicular Leydig cells to secrete testosterone, which diffuses into and acts upon Sertoli cells. FSH binding to Sertoli cells results in the elevation of cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A, which can phosphorylate a number of proteins including the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. Phosphorylation of CREB allows the induction of genes containing a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (3Gonzalez G. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar).The modulation of CREB expression levels represents a potential mechanism to alter Sertoli cell responsiveness to FSH. CREB expression in Sertoli cells has been demonstrated to vary in a stage-specific manner during the spermatogenesis cycle, (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 5West A.P. Sharpe R.M. Saunders P.T.K. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Walker W.H. Daniel P.B. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 143: 167-178Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). FSH-induced changes in cAMP levels have been implicated in the cyclical control of Sertoli cell CREB expression through CREs within the CREB promoter (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additional signaling pathways may also control stage-specific expression of CREB. Specifically, NF-κB transcription factors that were recently identified as activating gene expression in Sertoli cells (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) are potential regulators of CREB expression as the CREB promoter contains consensus NF-κB binding motifs.The family of NF-κB or Rel transcription factors consists of five known mammalian subunits (RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52). Multiple combinations of homo- and heterodimers are possible, thus providing the potential to generate both transactivators and transrepressors of transcription (10Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2010) Google Scholar, 11Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar, 12Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 13Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Scwartz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). In most cells NF-κB dimers remain sequestered in the cytoplasm by inhibitor proteins (IκB-α, IκB-β, IκB-γ, IκB-ε, and IκB-δ). Upon stimulation by diverse stimuli such as TNF-α, phorbol myristic acid, viral proteins, and interleukins, IκB is phosphorylated and ubiquinated leading to proteosome-mediated degradation. The NF-κB nuclear localization signal is then unmasked, and NF-κB is free to translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene expression via interactions with κB enhancer elements (reviewed in Ref. 14Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). In addition to being regulated via stimulus-induced release from IκB, the activity of free NF-κB can also be modulated through direct phosphorylation of the RelA subunit by protein kinase A (15Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 16Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The cytokine TNF-α is a regulator of NF-κB activity (reviewed in Ref. 11Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4582) Google Scholar) and therefore is a candidate regulator of CREB gene expression. In the testis TNF-α is secreted primarily by round spermatids within the seminiferous tubules, and the 55-kDa TNF-α receptor has been detected in Sertoli cells (17De S.K. Chen H.-L. Pace J.L. Hunt J.S. Terranova P.F. Enders G.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,18Mauduit C. Besset V. Caussanel V. Benahmed M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that TNF-α increases the activity of NF-κB in rat Sertoli cells and that NF-κB levels in the nuclei of Sertoli cells are highest during the stages in which round spermatids are present (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In this study we test the hypothesis that NF-κB and TNF-α are regulators of CREB expression. We demonstrate that Sertoli cell NF-κB proteins interact with NF-κB binding sites in the CREB promoter. We also show that overexpression of NF-κB subunits in Sertoli cells and NIH 3T3 cells increases CREB promoter activity. Stimulation of primary Sertoli cells with the cytokine TNF-α mediates a reduction in IκB-α and IκB-β levels, a concomitant increase in RelA nuclear translocation and the induction of NF-κB binding to a CREB promoter NF-κB enhancer motif. Transient transfection analyses demonstrate that TNF-α also stimulates CREB gene promoter activity. These data suggest that NF-κB may be an important regulator of genes required for spermatogenesis and a general regulator of CREB gene expression in non-testis cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that NF-κB proteins present in Sertoli cells specifically bind κB enhancer motifs within the CREB promoter. Four potential κB enhancer elements were identified in the CREB promoter by computer-assisted sequence analysis. The two gene proximal κB motifs bound NF-κB proteins more effectively than the distal consensus sequences. The binding of NF-κB was functionally significant as overexpression of NF-κB proteins in Sertoli cells stimulated transcription from the CREB promoter. Although NF-κB is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, TNF-α was shown to induce the degradation of IκB and further increase the levels of nuclear NF-κB in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, TNF-α was found to stimulate CREB gene expression in primary Sertoli cells and the HEK293 cell line.In transient transfection studies of primary Sertoli cells, the basal activity of the −1264CREB promoter was 2- and 4-fold higher than the activities of the −537CREB and −278CREB promoter fragments, respectively. The decrease in −537CREB promoter activity in Sertoli cells but not NIH 3T3 cells may reflect the loss of two distal κB elements and the higher relative nuclear levels of NF-κB in Sertoli cells compared with NIH 3T3 cells. The more dramatic decrease in activity for the −278CREB promoter may be because of the elimination of Sp1 motifs as described earlier (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the proximal κB enhancer motifs. Although the relative basal activities of the −1264CREB, −537CREB and −278CREB promoter constructs in Sertoli cells were similar to that of an earlier report (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to make precise comparisons of the basal activity between various constructs as transfection efficiencies were not standardized using unregulated, control reporter constructs. Nevertheless, NF-κB proved to be a potent inducer of the CREB promoter as overexpression of NF-κB p50 and RelA or RelA alone stimulated transcription from the full-length −1264CREB promoter six-fold. Although the distal κB3 and κB4 motifs may contribute to the induction of the CREB promoter, deletion analysis of the CREB promoter showed that the region containing the proximal κB1 and κB2 motifs is required to maintain high basal expression and full NF-κB induction of the CREB promoter. The induction through κB1 and κB2 is not unexpected as these sequences most effectively bind NF-κB present in Sertoli extracts. Deletion analysis of the −680 to −1160 upstream region of the CREB promoter also suggests that this region may contain negative elements as removal of this region results in a 2-fold increase in basal activity.The demonstration of CREB promoter stimulation by NF-κB in Sertoli cells suggested that NF-κB may regulate this gene in other cell types. In this regard, we found that the CREB gene is up-regulated by NF-κB overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 2 B and3 B), and TNF-α induces the CREB promoter in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6 B). The regulation of CREB by NF-κB may be a new method of cross-talk between NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways to compliment the competition for the CREB-binding protein/p300 coactivator displayed by these factors (28Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 29Gerritsen M. Williams A. Neish A. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that CREB and NF-κB may cooperate for recruiting CREB-binding protein/p300 to the promoter as CREB and RelA interact with different regions of the coactivator. The opportunity for CREB-NF-κB interactions on the CREB promoter exists as the CREB promoter contains binding sites for CREB in close proximity to κB motifs (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RelA has been shown to directly interact with other bZIP family members related to CREB (ATF-2, c-Jun, and c-Fos) through a mini leucine zipper located in the Rel homology domain of RelA (30Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments RelA has been shown to also directly interact with CREB. 2W. Walker, unpublished results. Studies are underway to investigate potential cooperativity of NF-κB and CREB in stimulating transcription from the CREB promoter.In this initial characterization of IκB proteins from pure cultures of rat Sertoli cells, both IκBα and IκBβ were determined to be present in the cytoplasm, and the levels of both were dramatically reduced after the addition of TNF-α. A previous study failed to detect IκBα mRNA in extracts from whole mouse testis (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The inability to detect Sertoli cell-derived IκBα in whole testis is likely because of the small proportion of Sertoli cells in the mammalian testis. Fewer than 5% of adult mouse testis cells are Sertoli cells (19Bellvé A.R. Millette C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition to the immunodetection of IκBβ in Sertoli cells in the present report, IκBβ mRNA was previously shown to be enriched in mouse testis (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that whereas IκBα and IκBβ are both present in Sertoli cells, the developing germ cells, which account for greater than 90% of testis cells, likely contain IκBβ but not IκBα. Differences in the levels of the two IκB isoforms may be important in cell-specific gene regulation as stimulation of IκBα degradation is rapid and transient, but IκBβ degradation can be delayed and persistent (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar).One factor that may maintain high nuclear levels of NF-κB in Sertoli cells and account for additional NF-κB translocation to the nucleus is the cytokine TNF-α. In Sertoli cells, TNF-α activates NF-κB via the elimination of IκB from the cytoplasm and the subsequent translocation of additional NF-κB to the nucleus. TNF-α-mediated stimulation of NF-κB in Sertoli cells may be physiologically important because germ cells adjacent to Sertoli cells secrete TNF-α in a stage-specific manner. Although it is possible that TNF-α may also act through mitogen-activated protein kinase or other pathways, it is significant that NF-κB is activated by TNF-α in Sertoli cells. In the absence of nuclear NF-κB, apoptosis pathways may be initiated by TNF-α (32Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). In contrast to germ cell development in which some apoptosis is required to constrain the expansion of germ cells and maintain spermatogenesis (33Rodriguez I. Ody C. Araki K. Garcia I. Vassalli P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 34Bartke A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear NF-κB may protect Sertoli cells from apoptosis inducers. NF-κB-mediated protection from apoptosis agents would explain why few or no apoptotic Sertoli cells are detected in the testis (32Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar, 35Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 36Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar).In a previous study TNF-α alone was able to stimulate transcription from a minimal promoter containing two consensus κB enhancers (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-α induction of the CREB promoter in primary Sertoli cells required the addition of serum. These latest findings suggest that serum factors in addition to TNF-α are required to allow the activation of the more complex CREB promoter or that serum-dependent signaling pathways must be activated to allow some Sertoli cell genes to be regulated by TNF-α.Although other germ cell types secrete some TNF-α, most of the TNF-α is secreted by round spermatids (17De S.K. Chen H.-L. Pace J.L. Hunt J.S. Terranova P.F. Enders G.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because round spermatids are present during only the first eight stages (stages I-VIII) of the 14 stages of rat spermatogenesis, it is possible that TNF-α secretion may represent stage-specific communication between spermatids and Sertoli cells. In this regard, our previous studies (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that there are significant increases in the nuclear expression of NF-κB during stages I-VII of spermatogenesis, which would correspond to the time when TNF-α producing spermatids are present. Therefore, spermatid-Sertoli communication via TNF-α may signal Sertoli cells to activate NF-κB causing CREB to induce the production of specific factors that are required by spermatids or other germ cells. The stage-specific expression of TNF-α may be relevant to the previously reported dramatic cyclical changes in Sertoli cell CREB mRNA expression (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The timing for the induction of CREB mRNA expression correlates with the presence of round spermatids. Although CREB mRNA expression has been shown to be induced by FSH-mediated elevation of cAMP levels in stages II-V (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that spermatid-derived, TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation may contribute to the high levels of CREB mRNA that accumulate in Sertoli cells at specific stages of spermatogenesis.In summary, NF-κB and TNF-α are able to stimulate expression of the CREB gene in Sertoli cells. In the testis, NF-κB regulation of the CREB gene may prove to be important in providing the appropriate timing for the expression of downstream genes required for spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the ability of NF-κB and TNF-α to induce the CREB gene promoter in NIH 3T3 and HEK 293 cells suggests that NF-κB may be a general regulator of CREB expression in non-testis tissues. Spermatogenesis is a multistep process by which spermatogonial germ cells differentiate into mature spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules of the mammalian testis. In addition to germ cells at various developmental stages, the seminiferous tubules contain peritubular myoid cells, which line the outer wall of the tubule, and somatic Sertoli cells, which provide elements essential for germ cell maturation in response to endocrine and paracrine factors. The primary hormonal inputs regulating spermatogenesis are follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)1 and luteinizing hormone (1Sharpe R.M. Knobil E. Neil J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Raven Press, New York1994: 1363-1434Google Scholar, 2de Kretser D.M. Risbridger G.P. Kerr J. DeGroot L. Endocrinology, 3. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1995: 2307-2335Google Scholar). Luteinizing hormone stimulates testicular Leydig cells to secrete testosterone, which diffuses into and acts upon Sertoli cells. FSH binding to Sertoli cells results in the elevation of cAMP levels and activation of protein kinase A, which can phosphorylate a number of proteins including the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor. Phosphorylation of CREB allows the induction of genes containing a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (3Gonzalez G. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). The modulation of CREB expression levels represents a potential mechanism to alter Sertoli cell responsiveness to FSH. CREB expression in Sertoli cells has been demonstrated to vary in a stage-specific manner during the spermatogenesis cycle, (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol.

FSH-induced changes in cAMP levels have been implicated in the cyclical control of Sertoli cell CREB expression through CREs within the CREB promoter (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Additional signaling pathways may also control stage-specific expression of CREB. Specifically, NF-κB transcription factors that were recently identified as activating gene expression in Sertoli cells (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol.

In addition to being regulated via stimulus-induced release from IκB, the activity of free NF-κB can also be modulated through direct phosphorylation of the RelA subunit by protein kinase A (15Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 16Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The cytokine TNF-α is a regulator of NF-κB activity (reviewed in Ref. 11Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

Commun. 1996; 224: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that TNF-α increases the activity of NF-κB in rat Sertoli cells and that NF-κB levels in the nuclei of Sertoli cells are highest during the stages in which round spermatids are present (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this study we test the hypothesis that NF-κB and TNF-α are regulators of CREB expression. We demonstrate that Sertoli cell NF-κB proteins interact with NF-κB binding sites in the CREB promoter. We also show that overexpression of NF-κB subunits in Sertoli cells and NIH 3T3 cells increases CREB promoter activity. Stimulation of primary Sertoli cells with the cytokine TNF-α mediates a reduction in IκB-α and IκB-β levels, a concomitant increase in RelA nuclear translocation and the induction of NF-κB binding to a CREB promoter NF-κB enhancer motif. Transient transfection analyses demonstrate that TNF-α also stimulates CREB gene promoter activity. These data suggest that NF-κB may be an important regulator of genes required for spermatogenesis and a general regulator of CREB gene expression in non-testis cells. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that NF-κB proteins present in Sertoli cells specifically bind κB enhancer motifs within the CREB promoter. Four potential κB enhancer elements were identified in the CREB promoter by computer-assisted sequence analysis. The two gene proximal κB motifs bound NF-κB proteins more effectively than the distal consensus sequences. The binding of NF-κB was functionally significant as overexpression of NF-κB proteins in Sertoli cells stimulated transcription from the CREB promoter. Although NF-κB is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, TNF-α was shown to induce the degradation of IκB and further increase the levels of nuclear NF-κB in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, TNF-α was found to stimulate CREB gene expression in primary Sertoli cells and the HEK293 cell line.In transient transfection studies of primary Sertoli cells, the basal activity of the −1264CREB promoter was 2- and 4-fold higher than the activities of the −537CREB and −278CREB promoter fragments, respectively. The decrease in −537CREB promoter activity in Sertoli cells but not NIH 3T3 cells may reflect the loss of two distal κB elements and the higher relative nuclear levels of NF-κB in Sertoli cells compared with NIH 3T3 cells. The more dramatic decrease in activity for the −278CREB promoter may be because of the elimination of Sp1 motifs as described earlier (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the proximal κB enhancer motifs. Although the relative basal activities of the −1264CREB, −537CREB and −278CREB promoter constructs in Sertoli cells were similar to that of an earlier report (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to make precise comparisons of the basal activity between various constructs as transfection efficiencies were not standardized using unregulated, control reporter constructs. Nevertheless, NF-κB proved to be a potent inducer of the CREB promoter as overexpression of NF-κB p50 and RelA or RelA alone stimulated transcription from the full-length −1264CREB promoter six-fold. Although the distal κB3 and κB4 motifs may contribute to the induction of the CREB promoter, deletion analysis of the CREB promoter showed that the region containing the proximal κB1 and κB2 motifs is required to maintain high basal expression and full NF-κB induction of the CREB promoter. The induction through κB1 and κB2 is not unexpected as these sequences most effectively bind NF-κB present in Sertoli extracts. Deletion analysis of the −680 to −1160 upstream region of the CREB promoter also suggests that this region may contain negative elements as removal of this region results in a 2-fold increase in basal activity.The demonstration of CREB promoter stimulation by NF-κB in Sertoli cells suggested that NF-κB may regulate this gene in other cell types. In this regard, we found that the CREB gene is up-regulated by NF-κB overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 2 B and3 B), and TNF-α induces the CREB promoter in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6 B). The regulation of CREB by NF-κB may be a new method of cross-talk between NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways to compliment the competition for the CREB-binding protein/p300 coactivator displayed by these factors (28Chrivia J.C.

Alternatively, it is possible that CREB and NF-κB may cooperate for recruiting CREB-binding protein/p300 to the promoter as CREB and RelA interact with different regions of the coactivator. The opportunity for CREB-NF-κB interactions on the CREB promoter exists as the CREB promoter contains binding sites for CREB in close proximity to κB motifs (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F.

RelA has been shown to directly interact with other bZIP family members related to CREB (ATF-2, c-Jun, and c-Fos) through a mini leucine zipper located in the Rel homology domain of RelA (30Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in glutathione S-transferase-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments RelA has been shown to also directly interact with CREB. 2W. Walker, unpublished results. Studies are underway to investigate potential cooperativity of NF-κB and CREB in stimulating transcription from the CREB promoter.In this initial characterization of IκB proteins from pure cultures of rat Sertoli cells, both IκBα and IκBβ were determined to be present in the cytoplasm, and the levels of both were dramatically reduced after the addition of TNF-α. A previous study failed to detect IκBα mRNA in extracts from whole mouse testis (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The inability to detect Sertoli cell-derived IκBα in whole testis is likely because of the small proportion of Sertoli cells in the mammalian testis. Fewer than 5% of adult mouse testis cells are Sertoli cells (19Bellvé A.R. Millette C.F. Bhatnagar Y.M. O'Brien D.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 480-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In addition to the immunodetection of IκBβ in Sertoli cells in the present report, IκBβ mRNA was previously shown to be enriched in mouse testis (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that whereas IκBα and IκBβ are both present in Sertoli cells, the developing germ cells, which account for greater than 90% of testis cells, likely contain IκBβ but not IκBα. Differences in the levels of the two IκB isoforms may be important in cell-specific gene regulation as stimulation of IκBα degradation is rapid and transient, but IκBβ degradation can be delayed and persistent (27Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar).One factor that may maintain high nuclear levels of NF-κB in Sertoli cells and account for additional NF-κB translocation to the nucleus is the cytokine TNF-α. In Sertoli cells, TNF-α activates NF-κB via the elimination of IκB from the cytoplasm and the subsequent translocation of additional NF-κB to the nucleus. TNF-α-mediated stimulation of NF-κB in Sertoli cells may be physiologically important because germ cells adjacent to Sertoli cells secrete TNF-α in a stage-specific manner. Although it is possible that TNF-α may also act through mitogen-activated protein kinase or other pathways, it is significant that NF-κB is activated by TNF-α in Sertoli cells. In the absence of nuclear NF-κB, apoptosis pathways may be initiated by TNF-α (32Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar). In contrast to germ cell development in which some apoptosis is required to constrain the expansion of germ cells and maintain spermatogenesis (33Rodriguez I. Ody C. Araki K. Garcia I. Vassalli P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2262-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 34Bartke A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear NF-κB may protect Sertoli cells from apoptosis inducers. NF-κB-mediated protection from apoptosis agents would explain why few or no apoptotic Sertoli cells are detected in the testis (32Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2500) Google Scholar, 35Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 36Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar).In a previous study TNF-α alone was able to stimulate transcription from a minimal promoter containing two consensus κB enhancers (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNF-α induction of the CREB promoter in primary Sertoli cells required the addition of serum. These latest findings suggest that serum factors in addition to TNF-α are required to allow the activation of the more complex CREB promoter or that serum-dependent signaling pathways must be activated to allow some Sertoli cell genes to be regulated by TNF-α.Although other germ cell types secrete some TNF-α, most of the TNF-α is secreted by round spermatids (17De S.K. Chen H.-L. Pace J.L. Hunt J.S. Terranova P.F. Enders G.C. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because round spermatids are present during only the first eight stages (stages I-VIII) of the 14 stages of rat spermatogenesis, it is possible that TNF-α secretion may represent stage-specific communication between spermatids and Sertoli cells. In this regard, our previous studies (9Delfino F.J. Walker W.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1696-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that there are significant increases in the nuclear expression of NF-κB during stages I-VII of spermatogenesis, which would correspond to the time when TNF-α producing spermatids are present. Therefore, spermatid-Sertoli communication via TNF-α may signal Sertoli cells to activate NF-κB causing CREB to induce the production of specific factors that are required by spermatids or other germ cells. The stage-specific expression of TNF-α may be relevant to the previously reported dramatic cyclical changes in Sertoli cell CREB mRNA expression (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The timing for the induction of CREB mRNA expression correlates with the presence of round spermatids. Although CREB mRNA expression has been shown to be induced by FSH-mediated elevation of cAMP levels in stages II-V (4Waeber G. Meyer T.E. LeSieur M. Hermann H. Gérard N. Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1418-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that spermatid-derived, TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation may contribute to the high levels of CREB mRNA that accumulate in Sertoli cells at specific stages of spermatogenesis.In summary, NF-κB and TNF-α are able to stimulate expression of the CREB gene in Sertoli cells. In the testis, NF-κB regulation of the CREB gene may prove to be important in providing the appropriate timing for the expression of downstream genes required for spermatogenesis. Furthermore, the ability of NF-κB and TNF-α to induce the CREB gene promoter in NIH 3T3 and HEK 293 cells suggests that NF-κB may be a general regulator of CREB expression in non-testis tissues. In this study, we have demonstrated that NF-κB proteins present in Sertoli cells specifically bind κB enhancer motifs within the CREB promoter. Four potential κB enhancer elements were identified in the CREB promoter by computer-assisted sequence analysis. The two gene proximal κB motifs bound NF-κB proteins more effectively than the distal consensus sequences. The binding of NF-κB was functionally significant as overexpression of NF-κB proteins in Sertoli cells stimulated transcription from the CREB promoter. Although NF-κB is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of Sertoli cells, TNF-α was shown to induce the degradation of IκB and further increase the levels of nuclear NF-κB in Sertoli cells. Furthermore, TNF-α was found to stimulate CREB gene expression in primary Sertoli cells and the HEK293 cell line. In transient transfection studies of primary Sertoli cells, the basal activity of the −1264CREB promoter was 2- and 4-fold higher than the activities of the −537CREB and −278CREB promoter fragments, respectively. The decrease in −537CREB promoter activity in Sertoli cells but not NIH 3T3 cells may reflect the loss of two distal κB elements and the higher relative nuclear levels of NF-κB in Sertoli cells compared with NIH 3T3 cells. The more dramatic decrease in activity for the −278CREB promoter may be because of the elimination of Sp1 motifs as described earlier (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the proximal κB enhancer motifs. Although the relative basal activities of the −1264CREB, −537CREB and −278CREB promoter constructs in Sertoli cells were similar to that of an earlier report (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3534-3545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to make precise comparisons of the basal activity between various constructs as transfection efficiencies were not standardized using unregulated, control reporter constructs. Nevertheless, NF-κB proved to be a potent inducer of the CREB promoter as overexpression of NF-κB p50 and RelA or RelA alone stimulated transcription from the full-length −1264CREB promoter six-fold. Although the distal κB3 and κB4 motifs may contribute to the induction of the CREB promoter, deletion analysis of the CREB promoter showed that the region containing the proximal κB1 and κB2 motifs is required to maintain high basal expression and full NF-κB induction of the CREB promoter. The induction through κB1 and κB2 is not unexpected as these sequences most effectively bind NF-κB present in Sertoli extracts. Deletion analysis of the −680 to −1160 upstream region of the CREB promoter also suggests that this region may contain negative elements as removal of this region results in a 2-fold increase in basal activity. The demonstration of CREB promoter stimulation by NF-κB in Sertoli cells suggested that NF-κB may regulate this gene in other cell types. In this regard, we found that the CREB gene is up-regulated by NF-κB overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells (Figs. 2 B and3 B), and TNF-α induces the CREB promoter in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 6 B). The regulation of CREB by NF-κB may be a new method of cross-talk between NF-κB and CREB signaling pathways to compliment the competition for the CREB-binding protein/p300 coactivator displayed by these factors (28Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 29Gerritsen M. Williams A. Neish A. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that CREB and NF-κB may cooperate for recruiting CREB-binding protein/p300 to the promoter as CREB and RelA interact with different regions of the coactivator. The opportunity for CREB-NF-κB interactions on the CREB promoter exists as the CREB promoter contains binding sites for CREB in close proximity to κB motifs (7Walker W.H. Fucci L. Habener J.F.

We show here that the third SH3 domain binds to Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras and Rac, both in vitroand in vivo. Point mutations in the third SH3 domain abolished the vinexin-Sos interaction. Stimulation of NIH/3T3 cells with serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Sos and concomitantly inhibited formation of the vinexin-Sos complex. Phosphatase treatment of lysates restored the binding of Sos to vinexin, suggesting that signaling from serum, EGF, or PDGF regulates the vinexin-Sos complex through the Sos phosphorylation. To evaluate the function of vinexin downstream of growth factors, we examined the effects of wild-type and mutant vinexin expression on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) activation in response to EGF. Exogenous expression of vinexin β in NIH/3T3 cells enhanced JNK/SAPK activation but did not affect Erk activation. Moreover mutations in the third SH3 domain abolished EGF activation of JNK/SAPK in a dominant-negative fashion, whereas they slightly stimulated Erk. Together these results suggest that vinexin can selectively modulate EGF-induced signal transduction pathways leading to JNK/SAPK kinase activation.

Focal adhesions are composed of transmembrane integrin cell adhesion receptors, the termini of actin stress fibers, as well as membrane-cytoskeletal linking and signaling proteins including vinculin, talin, α-actinin, and paxillin, which link the actin cytoskeleton to the cell adhesion molecules (1Burridge K.

For example, receptors for basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),1 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as downstream molecules including Sos, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), Erk, and JNK are localized at focal adhesions or fibronectin-induced adhesion complexes (6Miyamoto S.

Moreover, signals from growth factors and the cell adhesion/cytoskeletal complex are well coordinated. Growth factor signaling can modulate cell motility and the cytoskeleton (8Klemke R.L. Yebra M.

Sos is composed of multiple functional domains, including a Dbl homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, a Ras GEF domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. The proline-rich domain is a binding site for the SH3 (Src homology 3) domains of adaptor proteins such as Grb2, Nck, and CrkII, and it mediates the intracellular translocation of Sos in response to growth factors (24Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar, 26Matsuda M.

The Dbl homology domain of Sos1 has been reported to have a GEF activity for another small GTPase Rac and to stimulate its downstream kinase, JNK/SAPK (27Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Since Rac is thought to regulate cytoskeletal reorganization, Sos may play important roles in coordinated signaling involving both growth control and cytoskeletal organization (27Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Vinexin is a novel vinculin-binding protein localized at focal adhesion and cell-cell junctions (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Expression of vinexin enhances actin cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading. Vinexin is transcribed into at least two alternative forms, vinexin α and β, both of which contain three SH3 domains. The first and second SH3 domains mediate the vinculin binding, whereas the binding partners of the third SH3 domain are unknown. Two closely related proteins, CAP/ponsin/SH3P12 and ArgBP2, have been identified. CAP/ponsin/SH3P12 also binds to vinculin as well as to other signaling molecules such as c-Cbl, insulin receptor, AF-6/afadin, and Sos, and it localizes at cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions (29Sparks A.B.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ArgBP2 binds to the Abelson protein tyrosine kinases, Arg and c-Abl, and localizes along stress fibers (33Wang B. Golemis E.A. Kruh G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17542-17550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These data suggest that this protein family may function in the coordinated regulation of signaling and the cytoskeleton, although such putative functions in signaling pathways are unclear. Vinexin β has the most characteristic features of this protein family. Most of vinexin β is occupied by three SH3 domains, and no apparent enzymatic domains have been identified so far (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This feature is similar to those of other adaptor or scaffold proteins, such as Grb2, Crk, and p130 cas (34Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 35Feller S.M. Ren R. Hanafusa H. Baltimore D. Trends Biochem.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It raises the possibility that vinexin β could function as a modulator of signal pathways. In the present study, we report that vinexin binds to Sos in vitro and in vivo, and this binding is mediated by the third SH3 domain of vinexin. Serum- and growth factor-induced Sos phosphorylation inhibited the formation of this vinexin-Sos complex. Furthermore, we found that vinexin modulated EGF-induced JNK/SAPK activation, in a process again dependent on the third SH3 domain of vinexin. These results indicate that vinexin β associates with Sos and that it can regulate JNK/SAPK MAP kinase cascades induced by EGF. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against Sos1 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-FLAG epitope monoclonal antibody (mAb M2), anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody (mAb 12CA5), and anti-phospho-Erk MAP kinase antibody were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co., Babco (Richmond, CA), and New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA), respectively. Plasmids containing HA-JNK/SAPK and pGST-c-Jun were generous gifts from Dr. Eisuke Nishida (Kyoto University). The GST fusion proteins containing vinexin domains, GST-1stSH3, GST-2ndSH3, and GST-1st2ndSH3, were described previously (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The third SH3 domain of vinexin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was designated pGST-3rdSH3. Two mutants of the third SH3 domain were generated by substitutions at two of the most conserved amino acids among the SH3 domains (37Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced by using the Sculptor in vitromutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The oligonucleotides 5′-CGATGGCTTCTTTGTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGAAATGTTGTAGCCC-3′ were used for the mutations of the tryptophan residue at position 306 of vinexin β to phenylalanine (mutant WF) and the tyrosine residue at position 324 to valine (mutant YV), respectively. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST fusion proteins were purified as described (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3 fibroblast cells were incubated for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% calf serum. The cells were then stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml), PDGF (20 ng/ml) (Sigma), or 20% calf serum for 10 or 60 min, followed by lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysates were affinity precipitated with 5 μg of the GST fusion proteins for 3 h as described (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Coprecipitated proteins were detected with the indicated specific antibodies and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Phosphatase treatment was performed as follows. Cells were lysed in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnCl2, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysates (20 μg) in 200 μl were incubated with or without calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (400 units, Takara Shuzo Co., Japan) for 1 h at 37 °C and then used for in vitro binding assays as described above. The expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged vinexin β was described previously (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two mutants (mutant WF and YV) in the third SH3 domain of FLAG-tagged vinexin β were generated as described above. These plasmids were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were stimulated with serum and growth factors and lysed as described above. Equal amounts of total protein were incubated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG mAb M2 for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h and then precipitated and washed extensively with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed as described above. ERK2 kinase activities were measured using anti-active ERK (anti-phospho-ERK) antibody. The expression plasmid for HA epitope-tagged Erk2 (38Gu J. Tamura M. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) was transfected into NIH/3T3 cells with or without FLAG-tagged vinexin β. Transfected cells were serum-starved and were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF. Cells were then solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 20 nm calyculin A, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate. HA epitope-tagged Erk2 kinases were immunoprecipitated with mAb 12CA5 and were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-active ERK antibody. JNK/SAPK activities were measured in an immune complex kinase assay as described (39Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were solubilized as described above. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation. HA epitope-tagged JNK/SAPKs were immunoprecipitated with mAb 12CA5. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 12.5 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg GST-c-Jun, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, kinase reaction products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography. Quantitation was performed using an image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). The proline-rich domain of Sos is the binding site for the SH3 domains of several adaptor proteins including those of Grb2, Nck, and CrkII. A novel cytoskeletal protein, vinexin β, consists of three SH3 domains with no apparent enzymatic feature so far, raising the possibility that vinexin β may be an adaptor protein and bind to Sos. To examine the interaction of vinexin with Sos in vitro, various SH3 domains of vinexin were expressed and purified as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1, A, B, andD). These GST fusion proteins, bound to glutathione beads, were incubated with cell lysates prepared from NIH/3T3 cells. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Sos1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the third SH3 domain of vinexin bound to Sos, whereas the first and second SH3 domains did not bind. A GST fusion protein containing both the first and second SH3 domains, a minimal vinculin binding region (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), also did not bind to Sos. These results suggested that the third SH3 domain of vinexin specifically binds to Sos. To confirm the specificity of binding of the third SH3 domain of vinexin to Sos, we mutated the tryptophan residue at position 306 of the third SH3 domain of vinexin β to phenylalanine (WF mutant) or the tyrosine residue at position 324 to valine (YV mutant) to disrupt function of the SH3 domain. These residues are highly conserved in various SH3 domains and have been shown to be required for binding to proline-rich sequences (37Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both GST fusion proteins with either of these mutated third SH3 domains completely lost Sos-binding ability (Fig. 1 E), indicating that the third SH3 domain of vinexin specifically interacts with Sos. Previous studies have demonstrated that growth factor stimulation results in the feedback serine/threonine phosphorylation of Sos, with concomitant dissociation of the complex between Sos and adaptor proteins (17Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 40Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25533-25538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or that between Sos/Grb2 and receptor tyrosine kinase (43Porfiri E. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5871-5877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine whether growth factor stimulation also modulates the affinity of Sos binding to vinexin, we first stimulated NIH/3T3 cells with 20% calf serum. As shown in Fig. 2 A, serum stimulation decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Sos and concomitantly destabilized the complex between the third SH3 domain of vinexin and Sos. The effects were relatively stable, with only a slight restoration and formation of vinexin-Sos complexes 60 min after serum stimulation (Fig. 2 A). We next examined the effects of EGF and PDGF on formation of the complex of vinexin and Sos. Similar to serum stimulation, both EGF and PDGF stimulation of NIH/3T3 also decreased the electrophoretic mobility of Sos and the affinities of Sos to vinexin (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrated that serum, EGF, and PDGF all induce dissociation of the complex between vinexin and Sos. To determine whether the interaction between vinexin and Sos occurs in vivo, we transfected FLAG-tagged vinexin β with or without point mutations in the third SH3 domain or the vector alone into NIH/3T3 cells. Lysates prepared from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb, and precipitates were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb or anti-Sos1 mAb. As shown in Fig. 3, Sos was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged vinexin β but not from the lysates transfected by vector alone. Sos was also not precipitated with mutated FLAG-tagged vinexin β containing mutations in the third SH3 domain. Moreover, Sos was not coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of serum-stimulated cells transfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β. These data suggested that the third SH3 domain of vinexin binds to Sos in intact cells as well as in vitro and that the interaction is regulated by serum stimulation. To determine whether the mobility shift of Sos and the interaction of vinexin with Sos are actually regulated by phosphorylation, serum-stimulated cell lysates were treated with alkaline phosphatase. Cell lysates incubated with or without alkaline phosphatase were precipitated with the GST fusion protein containing the third SH3 domain of vinexin. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when lysates were treated with alkaline phosphatase, the serum-induced electrophoretic mobility shift was substantially reversed (Fig. 4 A, lane 4, and Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Similarly, the binding of Sos to vinexin was restored after the phosphatase treatment (lane 6). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of Sos following serum stimulation is required for the electrophoretic mobility shift, at least in part, and for the dissociation of the vinexin-Sos complex. Sos catalyzes the exchange of GDP to GTP on Ras and Rac (27Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In the activated GTP-bound form, Ras and Rac activate several downstream targets, including Erk and JNK/SAPK, respectively (44Crews C.M. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1993; 74: 215-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 45Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 46Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of vinexin β expression on Erk2 and JNK/SAPK activation in response to EGF stimulation in NIH/3T3 cells. Cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged vinexin β, FLAG-tagged mutated vinexin βs, or the vector alone each with or without HA-tagged Erk2 or JNK/SAPK. Erk2 and JNK/SAPK activities were both stimulated by EGF. The highest activities were observed at 5 min for Erk2 and at 25 min for JNK/SAPK after EGF stimulation, when vector and HA-tagged kinases were cotransfected (data not shown). Therefore, the effects of overexpression of various forms of vinexin β were determined at these time points. Expression of vinexin β did not affect the Erk2 activation induced by EGF stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, expression of vinexin β enhanced JNK/SAPK activation in response to EGF stimulation as shown in Fig. 5. This effect was specific to wild-type vinexin β, and no activation was observed in cells transfected by mutated vinexin β. In fact, transfection with mutated vinexin β had marked dominant-negative effects in blocking most of the JNK/SAPK response to EGF (Fig. 5 B), although expression of mutated vinexin β appeared to enhance the Erk activation slightly (data not shown). Enhancement of EGF-induced JNK/SAPK activation by expression of wild-type vinexin β and dominant-negative effects by expression of mutated vinexin β were also observed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that vinexin β is involved in the activation of JNK/SAPK in response to EGF and that the third SH3 domain of vinexin β is important for this stimulation. We have recently identified vinexin as a novel focal adhesion protein, which plays a role in cytoskeletal organization and cell spreading (28Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Vinexin contains three SH3 domains. The first two SH3 domains are important for vinculin binding. In the present study, we show that the third SH3 domain of vinexin associates with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras and Rac, both in vitro and in vivo. Serum, PDGF, and EGF treatment induced dissociation of the vinexin-Sos complex by phosphorylating Sos. Moreover, expression of vinexin β in NIH/3T3 and COS-7 cells promoted JNK/SAPK activation in response to EGF. Vinexin molecules with point mutations in the third SH3 domain displayed potent dominant-negative activity in suppression of the JNK/SAPK response to EGF. Together these results indicate that vinexin modulates not only cytoskeleton/cell spreading but also signal transduction induced by EGF and other growth factors. We presented evidence that vinexin bound to Sos both in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that the binding site of vinexin for Sos was the third SH3 domain by using deletion mutants and point mutations in the third SH3 domain. The point mutations utilized here have been reported to disrupt the function but not the structure of SH3 domains (37Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that the loss of Sos-binding ability is derived from the loss of SH3 function and not an artifact of structural alteration. The exact binding site in Sos for vinexin remains to be determined, although the C-terminal proline-rich domain of Sos is the most plausible, because other SH3-containing adaptor molecules are known to bind in that region (24Hu Q. Milfay D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar, 26Matsuda M. Hashimoto Y. Muroya K. Hasegawa H. Kurata T. Tanaka S. Nakamura S. Hattori S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is also intriguing that the minimal vinculin-binding region of vinexin, the first and second SH3 domains, is not necessary for Sos binding. This result suggests that a ternary complex of vinculin-vinexin-Sos may form a functional unit. Serum-, EGF-, and PDGF-initiated signal transduction all regulated the affinity of Sos to vinexin by regulating Sos phosphorylation. Several lines of evidence have shown that serum or other growth factors can modulate Sos phosphorylation through Erk or other kinases and result in the dissociation of the adaptor-Sos complex (17Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 40Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12061-12067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In these cases, phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation of the complex are thought to provide negative feedback regulation for Ras and downstream signaling. The time course of dissociation of the vinexin-Sos complex was consistent with those of other adaptor-Sos complexes. These observations suggest that vinexin might also be involved in the regulation of signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases culminating in downstream MAP kinase activation. Vinexin enhanced the activation of JNK/SAPK in response to EGF. Mutations in the third SH3 domain that abolished the ability of vinexin to bind to Sos eliminated this effect. Most importantly, both of these mutations were capable of functioning as “dominant-negative” inhibitors that strongly suppressed EGF-mediated JNK/SAPK activation in both NIH/3T3 and COS-7 cells. These findings indicate that vinexin regulates the signaling pathway from EGF stimulation to JNK/SAPK activation using its third SH3 domain. Although the precise role of vinexin in JNK/SAPK activation is not clear, it is possible that vinexin is required to recruit Sos to focal adhesions into close proximity to other signaling molecules and that this bound Sos activates Rac, leading to JNK/SAPK activation (27Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 45Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

Recently human vinexin α (GenBankTM accession number AF037261) was reported in the GenBankTM data base to bind to PAK, an effector of Rac. Therefore, it is also possible that vinexin functions as a scaffold protein that binds to vinculin, Sos, PAK, and other molecules. In conclusion, we have found that vinexin binds not only to the cytoskeletal protein vinculin but also to the signaling molecule Sos. Vinexin is involved in the signaling from EGF to JNK/SAPK MAP kinase, as well as in the regulation of cytoskeleton/cell spreading.

https://openalex.org/W2053269070,"Although the importance of the microtubule network throughout cell life is well established, the dynamics of microtubules during apoptosis, a regulated cell death process, is unclear. In a previous study (Davis, P. K., and Johnson, G. V. (1999) Biochem. J. 340, 51–58) we demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau was increased during neuronal PC12 cell apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the increased tau phosphorylation that occurred during apoptosis impaired the microtubule binding capacity of tau. This study is the first demonstration that microtubule-binding by tau and high molecular weight tau is significantly impaired as a result of altered phosphorylation during a naturally occurring process, apoptosis. Furthermore, co-immunofluorescence studies reveal for the first time that tau populations within an apoptotic neuronal PC12 cell exhibit differential phosphorylation. In control PC12 cells, Tau-1 staining (Tau-1 recognizes an unphosphorylated epitope) is evident throughout the entire cell body. In contrast, Tau-1 immunoreactivity in apoptotic PC12 cells is retained in the nuclear/perinuclear region but is significantly decreased in the cytoplasm up to the plasma membrane. The selective distribution of phosphorylated tau in apoptotic PC12 cells indicates that tau likely plays a significant role in the cytoskeletal changes that occur during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2055602768,"Quinolones are the most active oral antibacterials in clinical use and act by increasing DNA cleavage mediated by prokaryotic type II topoisomerases. Although topoisomerase IV appears to be the primary cytotoxic target for most quinolones in Gram-positive bacteria, interactions between the enzyme and these drugs are poorly understood. Therefore, the effects of ciprofloxacin on the DNA cleavage and religation reactions of Staphylococcus aureus topoisomerase IV were characterized. Ciprofloxacin doubled DNA scission at 150 nm drug and increased cleavage ∼9-fold at 5 μm. Furthermore, it dramatically inhibited rates of DNA religation mediated by S. aureus topoisomerase IV. This inhibition of religation is in marked contrast to the effects of antineoplastic quinolones on eukaryotic topoisomerase II, and suggests that the mechanistic basis for quinolone action against type II topoisomerases has not been maintained across evolutionary boundaries. The apparent change in quinolone mechanism was not caused by an overt difference in the drug interaction domain on topoisomerase IV. Therefore, we propose that the mechanistic basis for quinolone action is regulated by subtle changes in drug orientation within the enzyme·drug·DNA ternary complex rather than gross differences in the site of drug binding. Quinolones are the most active oral antibacterials in clinical use and act by increasing DNA cleavage mediated by prokaryotic type II topoisomerases.

Quinolone antibacterials were first synthesized over 30 years ago (1Goss W.A. Deitz W.H. Cook T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 89: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl.

Although the founding member of this drug class, nalidixic acid, had limited medical applications, its discovery spawned tremendous interest in the clinical potential of these compounds. Since that initial breakthrough, the use of quinolone-based drugs to treat bacterial infections in humans has grown considerably (2Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl. J.

Before topoisomerase IV was discovered in 1990, DNA gyrase was believed to be the only significant target for quinolones in bacterial cells.

Although topoisomerase IV is a secondary target for these compounds in Escherichia coli, the cellular consequences of its interaction with quinolones are revealed only in the presence of drug-resistant DNA gyrase mutants (4Hooper D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 6Hooper D.C. Clin. Infect.

This change in target reflects the increased sensitivity of Gram-positive topoisomerase IV to quinolone-based compounds coupled with the naturally drug-resistant form of gyrase found in these bacteria (4Hooper D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 20Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Quinolones targeted to topoisomerase IV, for the first time, have opened many Gram-positive species to this family of potent antibacterial drugs. This has allowed improved treatment of many infections (especially those of the respiratory tract) that were resistant to other antibiotics (4Hooper D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Gootz T.D. Brighty K.E. Med. Res. Rev. 1996; 16: 433-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Hooper D.C. Clin. Infect.

Although Gram-positive topoisomerase IV has become an important new target for antibacterial drug discovery, its interactions with quinolones are poorly understood. Therefore, the present study characterized the effects of quinolones on the DNA cleavage/religation activity of topoisomerase IV fromStaphylococcus aureus. In marked contrast to the actions of antineoplastic quinolones against eukaryotic type II topoisomerases (which increase levels of DNA breakage by stimulating the forward scission reaction), quinolones act primarily by inhibiting the ability of topoisomerase IV to religate cleaved DNA molecules. Even though the functional drug interaction domain on type II topoisomerases has been maintained from bacterial to eukaryotic species, it appears that the mechanistic basis for quinolone action has not been conserved across evolutionary boundaries. Topoisomerase IV was cloned from S. aureus 4220, overexpressed as the separate subunits (GrlA and GrlB) in E. coli, and purified by a modification of the procedure of Hallettet al. (36Hallett P. Grimshaw A.J. Wigley D.B. Maxwell A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from log-phase cultures were pelleted, resuspended in TED buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), lysed by sonication, and repelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g for 30 min. Topoisomerase IV subunits were extracted from both the soluble fraction and the cell pellet. The two extracts were combined and dialyzed against TEDG buffer (TED plus 10% glycerol) and the subunits were purified by the method of Hallett et al. (36Hallett P. Grimshaw A.J. Wigley D.B. Maxwell A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the following changes. In the first step, the crude fraction was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column, washed with TEDG plus 0.25m NaCl, followed by a linear gradient of 0.25 to 1.0m NaCl in TEDG. Active fractions were combined, concentrated, brought to a final concentration of 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and loaded on a phenyl-Superose FPLC column. Samples were eluted with a linear gradient starting at 1 m(NH4)2SO4. Individual subunits were assayed for catalytic activity using an excess of the complementing subunit. The specific activity of S. aureus topoisomerase IV was 3.1 × 104 decatenation units/mg of protein (decatenating 200 ng of catenated kinetoplast DNA in 30 min at 37 °C). Human topoisomerase IIα was expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (37Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by the protocol of Kingma et al. (38Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Etoposide and ciprofloxacin were obtained from Sigma. The quinolone CP-115,953 was synthesized at Pfizer Central Research. Etoposide was stored as a 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide at 4 °C. Ciprofloxacin and CP-115,953 were stored as 40 and 30 mmstock solutions, respectively, in 0.1 n NaOH at −20 °C, then diluted one-fifth with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, immediately prior to use. Tris and ethidium bromide were obtained from Sigma; SDS and proteinase K were from Merck; restriction endonucleases, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England BioLabs; ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was isolated from E. coli as described previously (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A uniquely end-labeled 564-base pair DNA substrate (residues 376–939 in pBR322) was prepared as described by Burden et al.(40Burden D.A. Kingma P.S. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Patchan M.W. Thompson R.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29238-29244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage assays in the absence or presence of drugs were performed as described by Corbett et al. (41Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was incubated with 15 nm topoisomerase IV in 20 μl of cleavage buffer (35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C. Unless stated otherwise, reactions were carried out for 30 min. In drug competition assays, ciprofloxacin and etoposide both were present in the reaction mixture prior to the addition of topoisomerase IV, so that the enzyme was exposed simultaneously to both compounds. DNA cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS (0.5% final concentration) followed by EDTA (15 mm final concentration). Samples were digested with proteinase K (80 μg/ml final concentration) for 30 min at 45 °C. Following the addition of 60% sucrose, 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 0.5% xylene cyanole FF in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, DNA products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized by UV light, photographed through Kodak 23A and 12 filters with Polaroid type 665 film, and quantitated by scanning negatives with an E-C apparatus model EC910 densitometer in conjunction with Hoefer GS-370 Data System software. The intensity of bands in the negative was proportional to the amount of DNA present. Double-stranded DNA breaks were monitored by the conversion of negatively supercoiled plasmid to linear molecules. Sites of DNA cleavage were determined in the absence or presence of drugs using the protocol of Burden et al. (40Burden D.A. Kingma P.S. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Patchan M.W. Thompson R.B. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29238-29244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained 1.4 nm labeled linear 564-mer DNA (25 ng) and 6 nm topoisomerase IV in cleavage buffer, and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Alternatively, assays contained 60 nm human topoisomerase IIα in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol, and were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. In both cases, DNA cleavage complexes were trapped by the addition of SDS and samples were digested with proteinase K in the presence of EDTA, as above. DNA cleavage products were precipitated twice with ethanol, dried, and resuspended in 40% formamide, 8.4 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol FF. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% sequencing gels (42Knab A. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and dried. Reaction products were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Reactions were carried out by the procedure of Anderson et al. (31Anderson V.E. Gootz T.D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage/religation equilibria were established in the presence or absence of 5 μmquinolone using negatively supercoiled pBR322 substrates as described in the preceding section. Religation was initiated by shifting the temperature from 37 to 65 °C and stopped at various times up to 120 s by the addition of SDS (0.5% final concentration). Samples were processed and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in the preceding section. The apparent first-order rate of religation was determined by quantifying the loss of linear DNA. Ciprofloxacin is the most widely prescribed quinolone in clinical use and represents one of the most active oral antibacterial agents currently available (2Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl. J.

It is cytotoxic to a broad range of bacteria and has well documented activity against topoisomerase IV from Gram-negative species (2Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl. J.

As previously observed for its Gram-negative counterpart (31Anderson V.E. Gootz T.D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), topoisomerase IV from S. aureus displayed a robust DNA scission activity with negatively supercoiled substrates. A time course for DNA cleavage in the absence of drugs is shown in Fig. 1. The DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of the enzyme was established within 30 s of the start of the reaction, and at a 3:1 ratio of topoisomerase IV:plasmid molecule, ∼5% of the initial DNA substrate was cleaved. This is in contrast to human topoisomerase IIα, which cleaves <1% of the DNA molecules at a 30:1 ratio of enzyme:plasmid (31Anderson V.E. Gootz T.D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium of S. aureustopoisomerase IV was profoundly affected by addition of ciprofloxacin (Fig. 1, inset, and Fig. 2). DNA scission increased as much as 9-fold in the presence of 5 μm drug. The concentration of quinolone required to double levels of cleavage (i.e. the CC2 value) was ∼150 nm. The effect of ciprofloxacin on the Gram-positive enzyme was even greater than that previously observed forE. coli topoisomerase IV (31Anderson V.E. Gootz T.D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17879-17885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). With this latter enzyme, cleavage levels increased only 4.5-fold, and ∼500 nmquinolone was required to double scission (Fig. 2). Maximal levels of quinolone-induced DNA cleavage are attained within 1–2 min in the presence of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases fromDrosophila and humans (not shown). By comparison, it takes DNA gyrase ∼1 h to re-establish its cleavage/religation equilibrium when ciprofloxacin is included in reaction mixtures (43Cove M.E. Tingey A.P. Maxwell A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 2716-2722Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). S. aureus topoisomerase IV is intermediate to these two enzymes; maximal levels of DNA scission were observed within 10 min following incubation with ciprofloxacin (Fig. 3). As determined by their effects on DNA religation, drugs enhance DNA cleavage mediated by type II topoisomerases by two alternative (but not mutually exclusive) mechanisms (44Corbett A.H. Guerry P. Pflieger P. Osheroff N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 2599-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). While some drug classes strongly inhibit enzyme-mediated DNA religation, others have little effect on this reaction. Agents in this latter category presumably act by stimulating the forward rate of DNA cleavage. Specific members of the quinolone family (typified by CP-115,953, which is shown with ciprofloxacin in Fig. 4) display antineoplastic activity and are potent enhancers of DNA scission mediated by eukaryotic type II topoisomerases (31Anderson V.E.

One of the few previously recognized b-type soluble cytochromes in purple bacteria is a minor component and has a large molecular mass (3Bartsch R.G. Kakuno T. Horio T. Kamen M.D. J. Biol.

We found very similar proteins in the related species, Ectothiorhodospira vacuolata. High potential iron protein isozymes were also purified from these two species (10Kusche W.H. Trüper H.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 137: 266-271Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the sequences were found to be very similar (11Ambler R.P. Meyer T.E. Kamen M.D. Arch. Biochem.

In fact, they are so similar that the two bacteria may be considered to be strains of the same species. The cytochrome b 558 fromE. shaposhnikovii was reported to have a mass of 15.8 kDa and a redox potential of −210 mV (9Kusche W.H. Trüper H.G. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1984; 39: 894-901Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The immediate goal of this study was to identify the cytochrome and to determine its primary and tertiary structures as a contribution to the determination of its functional role. Native cytochromeb 558 from E. vacuolata was prepared essentially as described by Kusche and Trüper (9Kusche W.H. Trüper H.G. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1984; 39: 894-901Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence was determined with 1.9 mg of protein. Prior to sequencing, the cysteines of the protein were reduced with dithiothreitol and pyridylethylated as described by Friedman et al. (12Friedman M. Zahnley J.C. Wagner J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Heme and reagents were removed from the denatured protein by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25F column (22 × 1.5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) equilibrated in and eluted with 5% formic acid. Digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was performed on 18.6 nmol of pyridylethylated apoprotein in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:30 for 2 h at 37 °C. The same conditions were used for Glu-C endoproteinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) digestion, but the digestion mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Peptides obtained after enzymatic digestions were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Pep-S C2/C18 column (250 × 4 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromatographic equipment consisted of two Model 6000A chromatographic pumps (Waters, Milford, MA), an injector with a loop of 100-μl volume (Rheodyne, Inc., Cotati, CA), and a UV detector set at 220 nm (Pye Unicam, Cambridge, MA). The solvents used were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Automated N-terminal sequence and electrospray ionization mass analyses were performed as described (13Van Driessche G. Koh M. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Meyer T.E. Bartsch R.G. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The gene for the E. vacuolata cytochromeb 558 was obtained via PCR amplification (Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) using degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence of the protein. The sequence for the amino-terminal primer (based on the first six residues of the protein sequence) was 5′-AAYGARACNGARGCNACN-3′, and that of the carboxyl-terminal primer (based on sequence 84–90) was 5′-HTANCARAGRAGITCNCANGG-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned in the vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting construct (pGEMT-b 558) was verified by sequence analysis. To achieve secretion of cytochrome b 558 into the periplasmic space of E. coli, the gene was fused with the nucleotide sequence encoding the signal peptide (sOmpA) of the bacterial outer membrane protein OmpA. Thus, theb 558 gene was inserted after the sOmpA leader sequence using the NaeI and HindIII restriction sites of plasmid pT10sOmpArPDI (14De Sutter K. Hostens K. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 15Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Guisez Y.

Purif. 1998; 12: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As verified by DNA sequence analysis, sOmpA was fused in-frame to the matureb 558. The hybrid gene encoding the fusion sOmpA/b 558 was transferred from pT10sOmpAb 558 to pLPPsOmpArPDI using the restriction sites XbaI and HindIII and also to pQE60 (QIAGEN Inc.) as a NcoI/HindIII fragment. The b 558 gene was also cloned without signal sequence in the pQE60 plasmid. The resulting constructs (pLPPsOmpAb 558, pQE60sOmpAb 558, and pQE60b 558) were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The bacterial strain MC1061 (17Casadaban M. Cohen S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar) harboring the expression plasmid pLPPsOmpAb 558 was grown in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/ml). After 16 h of incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the periplasmic fraction was collected after treatment as described by Koshland and Botstein (18Koshland D. Botstein D. Cell. 1980; 20: 749-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting, the N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined to check for the correct removal of the signal peptide from the secreted protein. Purification of recombinant cytochromeb 558 was achieved by a two-step procedure utilizing ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatographies. The periplasmic protein fraction was first loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The cytochromeb 558 fraction was completely retained on the column and was eluted with 0.35 m NaCl and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. The pooled protein was further purified on an HL-Superdex 75 column (1.5 × 60 cm) connected to anÄkta chromatographic system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cytochrome b 558-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin filters (molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa). Mass spectroscopy and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis were used to judge the purity of the preparation. Protein samples were subjected to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206514) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue or silver (20Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). Native electrophoresis was used to detect the presence of the heme group by peroxidase reaction (21Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Ledwin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214256) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad 500-0006 kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard curve. The protein solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, to set up crystallization trials using the hanging drop diffusion method. The protein crystallized in 4m NaCl, pH 5.6, and 0.1 m MES. Crystals grew over a period of several days to a maximum size of 0.2 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm. The crystals belong to space group P3221 with unit cell parameters a andb = 46.406 Å and c = 91.66 Å. Assuming a molecular mass of 10,094.7 Da, as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, the V m value is 3.42, corresponding to a solvent content of 63.8%. These values are within the observed range for protein crystals (23Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar). Data collection was performed at the LURE Synchrotron (Orsay, France) on beam-line DW32 (λ = 0.97 Å) using a Mar-Research Mar345 imaging plate detector. The x-ray diffraction data were indexed, processed, scaled, and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38432) Google Scholar). A total of 92,730 measurements from 14,370 unique reflections were recorded, and R merge was 5.9% for the data between 15 and 1.65 Å with a completeness of 99.6%. The complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome b 558 (Fig. 1, sequence 1) was obtained by N-terminal sequence analysis of the native protein up to position 16 and of overlapping peptides obtained from Glu-C and Lys-C enzymatic digestions on pyridylethylated apoprotein. Peptides obtained from these two digestions covered the complete sequence. Fragment S12B contained an intramolecular disulfide bridge, which was found to connect Cys24 and Cys53 of the complete protein sequence. Mass data on the different peptides confirming the sequence data are summarized in Table I. The measured mass of native E. vacuolata cytochromeb 558 is 10,094.7 Da, which is in agreement with the calculated mass of 10,095.3 Da (Fig. 2).Table IMass analyses of peptides obtained after Lys-C and Glu-C endoproteinase digestions on pyridylethylated apoproteinPeakMeasured massCalculated massSequence positionDaDaS1491.3491.5Asn1–Glu4S2446.3445.5Gln14 –Glu17S3404.2404.4Ala60 –Glu62S4721.4721.7Ser57 –Glu62S52116.22216.4His18 –Asp34aThese fragments contain pyridylethylcysteine.,bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.S6A1309.21307.5Arg80bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.–Ile90B2087.2(2011.2)His18–Asp34bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.S71857.91858.1Thr63–Gln79bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.S9A4407.34407.0His18 –Asp34cFragments A and B are linked to each other by an intermolecular disulfide bridge at positions 24 and 53.BLeu35bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position. –Glu56cFragments A and B are linked to each other by an intermolecular disulfide bridge at positions 24 and 53.S10989.7990.2Ala5 –Glu13S12A1417.21417.6Ala5 –Glu17B4389.34389.0His18 –Glu56dThis fragment contains two cysteines at positions 24 and 53 that are linked by an intramolecular disulfide bridge.S15A3149.73147.6Thr63 –Ile90B2933.52933.3Thr63 –Glu88S162612.82611.0Glu69bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position. –Ile90K31117.61118.2Ser65 –Ala75bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.K61308.61307.5Arg80bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position. –Ile90K71189.41189.5Leu77bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.–Leu86bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.K91819.21818.1Arg76bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position. –Ile90K101890.31889.2Ala75bNonspecific cleavage occurs at this position. –Ile90K13A3066.46067.5Thr6–Lys31aThese fragments contain pyridylethylcysteine.B3611.03612.0Asn1–Lys31aThese fragments contain pyridylethylcysteine.K143811.93813.3Val32–Lys64aThese fragments contain pyridylethylcysteine.K167210.57213.1Asn1–Lys64K172919.02918.3Ser65–Ile90a These fragments contain pyridylethylcysteine.b Nonspecific cleavage occurs at this position.c Fragments A and B are linked to each other by an intermolecular disulfide bridge at positions 24 and 53.d This fragment contains two cysteines at positions 24 and 53 that are linked by an intramolecular disulfide bridge.

Theinset is the original spectrum with indication of them/z values for the series z = 7–10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A BLAST search of GenBankTM indicated that cytochromeb 558 is related to cytochromeb 5, yeast flavocytochromeb 2, plant nitrate reductases, animal sulfite oxidases, and the fatty-acid desaturases of plants and animals. We developed the strategy to determine the crystal structure of cytochromeb 558 to identify it more conclusively. Because we had insufficient native protein for crystallization trials, we prepared recombinant protein for these studies. Information obtained from back-translation of the amino acid sequence was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers for PCR against the E. vacuolata genomic DNA template. A PCR fragment of the appropriate size and sequence was obtained, showing that it was the correct product derived from theb 558 gene. The periplasmic protein fractions from the pQE60sOmpAb 558, pT10sOmpAb 558, and pLPPsOmpAb 558 constructs were prepared fromE. coli cells, grown aerobically at 37 °C until saturation (A 600 = 2.3). Recombinant cytochromeb 558 was expressed from plasmid pLPPsOmpAb 558 only when isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was omitted. When isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, expression was considerably suppressed. The other plasmids did not produce any detectable amounts of cytochrome. Therefore, pLPPsOmpAb 558 was used for expression of cytochrome b 558. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown) showed cytochromeb 558 to be the major component in the periplasmic protein fraction. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed the expected sequence of mature cytochromeb 558, confirming the correct processing of the signal peptide by an E. coli signal peptidase. To ascertain that recombinant cytochrome b 558did incorporate a heme cofactor, the tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide test was performed. On native polyacrylamide gels, a unique band was indeed visualized due to the peroxidase activity of the cytochrome. The dithionite-reduced and air-oxidized difference absorption spectra indicated that the oxidized Soret peak maximum was at 414 nm; and upon reduction, the α-peak was at 557.5 nm, and the Soret peak was shifted to 424.5 nm and increased in magnitude (Fig. 3), confirming that it had native redox properties. Cytochrome b 558 was successfully purified from the osmotic shock fluid by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Analysis using isoelectric focusing gels showed that cytochrome b 558 was retained at a pH of 4.5, which is in accordance with the calculated pI value of 4.75 based upon the sequence (data not shown). On a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column, cytochrome b 558 bound very efficiently at pH 7.4. The eluted protein was judged to be 90% pure. To remove minor contaminating proteins, the cytochrome b 558fraction was loaded on an HL-Superdex 75 column in 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl. Analysis on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and mass spectrometry showed the protein to be fully pure. The crystal structure of cytochrome b 558 was solved by molecular replacement with bovine cytochrome b 5(Protein Data Bank code 1CYO) as the search model. Molecular replacement calculations were performed using AmoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out using the maximum likelihood-based program REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Ordered water molecules were included by selecting the peaks based onF o − F c difference Fourier maps contoured at 3.0 ς and the 2F o −F c density contoured at 1 ς (Fig. 4). Residues and side chains not visible in the electron density were omitted from the model.

Open table in a new tab The polypeptide chain of cytochrome b 558 is folded in five short α-helices and five β-strands involved in a twisted sheet structure (Fig. 5). This is the same overall three-dimensional structure as for eukaryotic cytochrome b 5 (31Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The first five N-terminal and the last four C-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density. Most α-helices are very short, having incomplete α-helical geometry (31Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we show the structure-based alignment of cytochrome b 558 with cytochromeb 5 sequences for which the three-dimensional structures are already known. All of them are soluble or membrane-bound redox proteins, although in some, the cytochrome b is a domain within a larger enzyme structure (such as, for example, sulfite oxidase and flavocytochrome-b 2:lactate dehydrogenase). When comparing cytochromeb 558 with the cytochromeb 5 domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeflavocytochrome b 2 (32Xia Z.X. Mathews F.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 837-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and with bovine microsomal cytochrome b 5 (33Durly R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is apparent that cytochrome b 558 resembles the latter more closely, having the same orientation for both α-helix 5 and the heme group. The C-α traces of b 558 and bovine microsomal b 5 are very similar (Fig. 6 A), the only major differences being situated in the loops connecting the α-helices involved in heme binding. A close comparison of the two molecules clearly indicates a different orientation of the heme-binding region relative to the twisted sheet structure in b 558. This rather small movement is mediated by changes in backbone torsion angles around Gln55, Leu35, and Tyr81. A structural characteristic novel to the b 5 fold in cytochrome b 558 is the disulfide bridge between two strands formed by Cys24 and Cys53. Although a single cysteine is observed at position 24 (b 558 numbering) in plant cytochromesb 5 (34Smith M.A. Stobart A.K. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 3: 527-537Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and yeast flavocytochromeb 2, most animal cytochromesb 5 lack cysteine altogether. The disulfide bridge appears to span a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the molecule. This cleft is situated in between two hydrophobic sites of the protein as described by Mathews and co-workers (31Mathews F.S. Levine M. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It functions as a sort of a channel making the heme more accessible to the solvent. Recent molecular dynamics simulations (35Storch E.M. Grinstead J.S. Campbell A.P. Daggett V. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5065-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) as well as NMR and fluorescence studies (36Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9682-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) provide evidence of localized motion at the cleft area. The same authors (36Storch E.M. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9682-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Storch E.M. Daggett V. Atkins W.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5054-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) studied a “de novo” incorporated disulfide bond in theb 5 protein, near the same position as in native cytochrome b 558. Their result suggests that the engineered disulfide bond inhibits the dynamics of the cleft formation. In the case of cytochrome b 558, the influence of the disulfide bridge on the native dynamics remains to be investigated, as does its influence on the interaction with redox partners. A comparison of the structures of cytochromeb 558, bovine cytochromeb 5, yeast flavocytochromeb 2 (Fig. 6 B), and chicken sulfite oxidase (38Guiard B. Lederer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 100: 441-453Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Kisker C. Schindelin H. Pacheco A. Wehbi W.A. Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Enemark J.H. Rees D.C. Cell. 1991; 91: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (433) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 C), a molybdopterin cytochromeb 5, clearly shows the locations of insertions and deletions. Cytochrome b 558 has a four-residue insertion one position ahead of the sixth heme ligand (His70). This is illustrated in the sequence alignment of Fig. 1. It is curious that several of the insertions and deletions occur at the molecular surface around the heme where electron transfer is thought to take place. They may thus play a role in molecular recognition of reaction partners. The heme group in cytochrome b 558 is buried in a hydrophobic cleft flanked by four short α-helices (α-helices 2–5) at the sides and by the twisted β-sheet at the bottom (Fig. 5). In comparison with bovine b 5, the heme group is in the so-called B-conformation, rotated 180° around thea,y-meso-carbon atoms relative to the observed A-conformation in bovine b 5 (Fig. 6 A). In b 558, the A-orientation would be less stable due to a close contact with Leu78, a bulky residue that replaces the smaller Ser78 of bovineb 5. His42 and His70, extending from the side of the cavity, ligate the iron atom. Whereas in bovine cytochrome b 5, one propionic acid group is curved toward the interior of the molecule and the other projects outward in solution, cytochrome b 558 has both heme propionates bent back toward the interior of the molecule. Both propionates form salt bridges with Lys64 (Fig. 7), a structural property not normally encountered in cytochromes b 5, but frequently observed in cytochromes c. Whereas propionate B is hydrogen-bonded to Tyr66, propionate A is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group and the peptide nitrogen of Ser71, the latter contact being preserved in bovine b 5. Both Lys64 and Tyr66 are close to or part of the four-residue insertion in the b 558 sequence when compared with the b 5 family. The loop connecting α-helices 2 and 3 at the other side of the heme plane is formed by the strictly conserved Pro43-Gly44-Gly45 sequence in the cytochrome b 5 family. This sequence is positioned at a strategic point where chain reversal occurs, leaving no space to accommodate a side chain at positions 44 and 45. In cytochromeb 558, however, the second glycine is replaced by another proline residue, reorienting the local backbone conformation relative to bovine b 5. This relocation results in a change in the hydrogen bond partner for the second imidazole nitrogen of His42, which is normally the carbonyl oxygen of Gly45, to a water molecule. The other heme ligand (His70) is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Trp61, similar to the interaction with Phe61 in bovine b 5. The Phe61 aromatic ring in cytochrome b 558 is stacked parallel to the imidazole plane of the second histidine, positioning it firmly in the heme-binding site. This residue is replaced by Trp61 in cytochrome b 558, with the indole group having the same structural role. In addition to the hydrophobic core that constitutes the heme-binding site, a second and smaller hydrophobic core is situated at the other side of the twisted β-sheet. This core is even more compact in cytochrome b 558, where the replacement of the bulky side chains of Ile15 and Ile27 by valine and alanine allows α-helix 1 to pack more closely to the β-sheet. Trp25 is part of a conserved structural motif in the small hydrophobic core: its indole side chain is sandwiched between the imidazole ring of His18 and a methyl group of Ile83. In bovine b 5, Ser21 is hydrogen-bonded to Arg50, which is in electrostatic interaction with Glu46. This hydrophilic interaction has a hydrophobic counterpart inb 558, where Pro21 is in van der Waals interaction with Leu50, resulting in a reorientation of the local backbone conformation around Pro21. In addition to the Arg50/Glu46 contact, bovineb 5 has two more salt bridges between exposed side chains. These contacts do not exist in cytochromeb 558, which has no salt bridges except for the interaction of Lys64 with the heme propionates (see above). Two sets of polar interactions that contribute to anchoring the wall of the heme-binding site to the bottom are conserved in both proteins. On one side of the heme, the hydroxyl group of Thr36 is hydrogen-bonded to both the peptide amide of Cys24 and the carboxylate of Asp34, whereas on the other side, Thr58 interacts with Glu56 and the backbone nitrogen of His29. Bovine b 5 has several negatively charged residues surrounding the exposed heme edge. These residues are implicated in electrostatic interactions with their physiological partners. Redox partners carry a complementary positively charged ring as described in the model of Salemme and co-workers (40Wendoloski J.J. Matthew J.B. Weber P.C. Salemme F.R. Science. 1987; 238: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) for the cytochrome b 5-cytochrome c complex. On the other hand, intramolecular interactions between the cytochromeb 2 domain and the FAD domain in flavocytochromeb 2 involve but one salt bridge interaction, all others being water-mediated hydrogen bonds or van der Waals interactions. Likewise, cytochrome b 558 has no predominant negative charge positioned around the exposed heme edge (Fig. 8). Besides Glu68, only the two propionic acid groups carry a negative charge in this region, and they are partially neutralized by Lys64. The interactions of cytochrome b 558 with hypothetical reaction partners could thus be quite different from those of cytochrome b 5. A biological function for E. vacuolata cytochromeb 558 is not known so far. However, we do want to propose two possibilities, which we deduced from considering the distribution of cytochrome b 5 homologues, including an analysis of the >20 bacterial and two eukaryotic genomes that are presently known. Cytochrome b 5 had not been reported in any bacterial species until now, and b 5 genes have not been identified in any of the bacterial genomes. However, a BLAST search of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome (42Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6474) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of an unidentified gene (Rv1371) with similarity to the fatty-acid desaturases of plants, animals, and fungi. That it is indeed a b 5 homologue is shown in the alignment of Fig. 1. It has the two His heme ligands located at the appropriate positions in the sequence, the Pro-Gly-Gly tripeptide after the fifth heme ligand, and Trp22 as well as other conserved residues. It has the flavocytochrome b 2 deletion ahead of the sixth heme ligand and a two-residue insertion after helix 5. It also appears to have one of the sulfite oxidase insertions after the sixth heme ligand. The M. tuberculosis cytochromeb 5 differs from other cytochromesb 5 in having a single-residue deletion three or four residues after Trp22. We think there are two likely functional roles for cytochrome b 558 in E. vacuolata. It could be a subunit of a fatty-acid desaturase as found in M. tuberculosis, yeast (43Mewes H.W. Albermann K. Bahr M. Frishman D. Gleissner A. Hani J. Heumann K. Kleine K. Maierl A. Oliver S.G. Pfeiffer F. Zollner A. Nature. 1997; 387: 7-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and animals such asCaenorhabditis elegans (44Ainscough R. Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3584) Google Scholar). An equally likely alternative because of the utilization of reduced sulfur compounds by E. vacuolata is a sulfite oxidase subunit. The present eukaryotic cytochromes b 5 can be assumed to be derived from an ancestral prokaryotic cytochrome b 5, for which the E. vacuolata cytochromeb 558 could stand as a model. The structure of the prokaryotic cytochrome b 558 shows that this protein provides an evolutionarily stable framework that permits a considerable exchange of residues, including the amino acids at the surface as well as amino acids outlining the heme environment, causing no fundamental structural change in the polypeptide backbone. Comparing ∼40 deposited b 5 sequences, Lederer (6Lederer F. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 674-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) located eight invariant residues in the b 5fold, of which two now appear not to be conserved in the prokaryotic cytochrome b 558. The two residues that are replaced are involved in the interactions with the heme ligands (His42 and His70). The proline that replaces Gly45 in the His-Pro-Gly-Gly loop causes slight changes in the backbone conformation and creates space for an extra water molecule in the His42 environment. The invariant Phe61is replaced by tryptophan, retaining the same role in the stabilization of His70. Both changes do not seem to be typical of prokaryotic b 5, as the M. tuberculosis open reading frame has Gly at position 45 and lacks an aromatic side chain at position 61 altogether. Although it is surprising how strict the fold is conserved throughout evolution, the function of cytochrome b 5diverged in eukaryotic organisms, and the protein has become a modular domain of several redox systems. Residues conserved throughout theb 5 family are therefore to be associated with folding of the protein and binding of a heme group and not with interacting with the redox partners. With the exception of Gly45, replaced by Pro45, all these residues are conserved in cytochrome b 558. It is interesting to note that the E. vacuolata protein is not significantly more related to any particular functional class of eukaryotic cytochrome b 5, whether the microsomalb 5 domain of flavocytochromeb 2, sulfite oxidase, or fatty-acid desaturases. It is in fact almost equidistant to these four subclasses of the cytochrome b 5 family. We sincerely thank Drs. K. De Sutter and N. Mertens for providing E. coli expression plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2051753112,"Vaccinia virus has a DNA genome, yet replicates in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell. We previously described the identification of a cellular protein having high affinity for vaccinia virus late promoter DNA. Sequence substitutions in the vaccinia I1L promoter were used to define a 5-nucleotide block at the transcription initiation site as essential for interaction with the protein. Within this sequence is the recognition motif for the nuclear transcription factor YY1. This factor regulates a multitude of cellular promoters, as an activator of transcription, as a repressor, or as an initiator element-binding protein. Antibodies directed against YY1 were used to show that YY1 copurified with the vaccinia late promoter-binding protein and was present in late promoter-protein complexes in gel supershift assays. Bacterially expressed YY1 also bound specifically to late promoter DNA. A dinucleotide replacement within the YY1 recognition motif directly adjacent to the transcription start site severely reduced the affinity of YY1 for the I1L promoter in vitro and impaired I1L promoter-dependent transcription in vivo. The intracellular localization of YY1 was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy to shift from primarily nuclear to the cytoplasm after vaccinia infection. These results indicate that YY1 has a positive role in the regulation of vaccinia virus late gene transcription and suggest that poxviruses have adapted cellular initiator elements as a means of regulating viral gene expression. This is the first identifiable cellular protein implicated in poxvirus transcription."

As a helicase, the 63-kDa gene 4 protein translocates 5′-to-3′ on ssDNA1 (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The smaller 56-kDa protein lacks a 7-kDa Cys4 zinc ribbon motif as well as the ability to prime DNA synthesis (11Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of primase activity in the 56-kDa gene 4 protein has enabled detailed kinetic studies to be conducted using the T7 helicase (11Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14891-14899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hacker K.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14080-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Washington M.T. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7880-7887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the competitive effects of multiple activities have complicated characterization of T7 DNA primase activity. For example, although the T7 helicase preferentially hydrolyzes dTTP as the energy source to unwind double-stranded DNA, the enzyme also hydrolyzes ATP (9Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, this activity would dramatically lower the concentration of ATP in primase assays and therefore artificially decrease rates of primer synthesis measured. We have recently isolated the DNA primase from bacteriophage T7 as a 30-kDa peptide fragment containing only the N-terminal 271 amino acids (14Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a region homologous to the bacterial DNA primases (15Ilyina T.V. Gorabalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This “primase fragment” lacks dTTPase and helicase activities but retains primase activity (14Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We showed in the accompanying paper that at saturating concentrations of DNA, the primase fragment catalyzes oligoribonucleotide synthesis at rates even higher than that of the 63-kDa gene protein (16Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This system, requiring only a 30-kDa protein, a 7-nucleotide DNA template, NTPs, and Mg2+, provides an elegant model system to study template-directed nucleic acid polymerases. Here, we use the primase fragment to examine the rates of each step in oligoribonucleotide synthesis and to examine the binding of the NTP precursors required for the oligonucleotide initiation. Such studies would be impossible using the full-length gene 4 protein since NTPs are rapidly hydrolyzed as the energy source for translocation of the helicase domain. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Corralville, IA). Their sequences are listed in the Results or Fig. Legends. Primase recognition sites are underlined. The concentration of each DNA oligonucleotide (moles 3′-ends/L) was calculated from A260 and its extinction coefficient. The primase fragment contains residues 1–271 of the 63-kDa gene 4G64 protein and was purified as described (14Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The gene 4G64 is a 63-kDa gene 4 protein encoded by a T7 gene 4 where the start codon for the small form of the gene 4 protein was eliminated, substituting glycine for methionine-64 (17Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This mutant allele supports the growth of phage lacking gene 4, and the enzymatic activities of the M64G protein are indistinguishable from wild-type 63-kDa gene 4 protein (17Mendelman L.V. Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10638-10642Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The 63-kDa M64G allele was modified to code for a protein containing only the N-terminal 271 amino acids of the T7 gene 4 protein. We refer to this peptide as the primase fragment because it lacks dTTPase and helicase activities but retains primase activity (14Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). NTPs and radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The ATP analogues α,β-methylene ATP, β,γ-methylene ATP, and β,γ-imido ATP were purchased from Sigma. The CTP analogue 3′-dCTP was synthesized from 3′-deoxycytosine as follows. Phosphorus oxychloride (230 mg, 1.5 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred, cool (0–5 °C) solution of 3′-deoxycytidine (227 mg, 1 mmol) in a mixture of trimethylphosphate and triethylphosphate (1:1, 6 ml). After 3 h, the reaction mixture was simultaneously treated with a 0.5 m N,N-dimethylformamide solution of tri-n-butyl ammonium pyrophosphate (5 mmol) and tributylamine (5 mmol). After stirring for 10 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with a 1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate solution (20 ml, pH 7.5) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The crude mixture was purified on Sephadex A-25 column using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.5). The triphosphate peak fractions were collected, concentratedin vacuo, and purified by reserve phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters Delta-PakTM 15 micron C-18 column (1.9 × 30 cm)) using a gradient of 0–100% buffer A (0.1m triethylammonium bicarbonate) and buffer B (25% acetonitrile in 0.1 m TEAB) at 12 ml/min. Yield was 150 mg of 3′-dCTP. Analysis of the product by 31P NMR (ppm) (D2O/EDTA) gave three peaks: 10.17 (dimer), 10.65 (dimer), and 22.71 (trimer). Oligoribonucleotide synthesis was measured as described in the accompanying paper (16Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Except for the experiment described in Fig. 1, all reactions were carried out in the presence of 10 mm free Mg2+. Assuming each mol of NTP binds 1 mol of Mg2+ tightly, NTPs were premixed with equal molar concentrations of MgCl2 before use, and 10 mmadditional MgCl2 was added to each reaction. Oligonucleotide extension reactions were performed under conditions similar to those described for the oligoribonucleotide synthesis assay (16Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) except that the extension of the ribonucleotide 5′-ACC-3′ was monitored. The primase fragment was incubated with 0.44 mmof 5′-ACC-3′, 50 μm DNA template, and 1 mm of [α-32P]NTP. Reactions contained 50 μmtemplate, 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mmpotassium glutamate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm potassium glutamate, and the indicated concentrations of primase fragment. After incubation at 23 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% xylene cyanol FF, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, the products were separated by electrophoresis on a 25% polyacrylamide gel containing 3 m urea, and amounts of products were measured using phosphorimage analysis with a Fuji BAS 1000 Bio-imaging analyzer. The synthesis of oligoribonucleotides by the T7 DNA primase requires ATP and CTP, divalent cations, and a ssDNA template (1Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On natural ssDNA templates, most of these primers are synthesized at specific DNA sequences designated “primase recognition sites,” the majority of which contain the sequence 5′-(G/T)GGTC-3′ or 5′-GTGTC-3′ (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis begins opposite the dT in the recognition site, and all primers have the triphosphate moiety of ATP retained at the 5′-terminus (1Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Romano L.J. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10476-10482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The essential 3′-C in the recognition site is not copied into the primer and is designated as “cryptic” (7Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Mendelman L.V. Kuimelis R.G. McLaughlin L.W. Richardson C.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10187-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The primase makes contact with the DNAvia interactions with the two initiating NTPs, the cryptic C, and the two bases flanking the 3′-end of the cryptic C. As a consequence, although a 5-nucleotide DNA template (i.e.5′-GGGTC-3′) is sufficient to support oligoribonucleotide synthesis, a 7-nucleotide template such as 5′-GGGTCAA-3′ provides for optimal synthesis (16Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA binds more tightly to the helicase domain of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein but in a sequence-independent manner. The translocation of the helicase along ssDNA, fueled by the hydrolysis of NTPs, likely regulates contacts made between the primase and primase recognition sites in DNA. To study directly oligoribonucleotide synthesis, we have used short synthetic DNA templates and the primase fragment of the T7 gene 4 protein that lacks helicase and NTPase activities but retains the ability to synthesize oligoribonucleotides. The primase fragment requires only DNA containing a primase recognition site in addition to ATP, CTP, and divalent metal ions to catalyze the synthesis of short template-directed oligoribonucleotides (16Frick D.N. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All known T7 primase recognition sites on natural DNA templates share the core trinucleotide sequence 5′-GTC-3′, and in the presence of synthetic templates containing this sequence, the T7 primase catalyzes the synthesis of the dinucleotide pppAC from precursors ATP and CTP (20Mendelman L.V. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23240-23250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this trinucleotide sequence occurs much more frequently in DNA than longer primase recognition sites such as 5′-GGGTC-3′, it was of interest to determine the relative efficiency with which the primase synthesizes oligoribonucleotides when given only this trinucleotide sequence. Oligoribonucleotide synthesis reactions were performed using three different DNA templates composed of the sequences 5′-TGGTCAA-3′, 5′-GGTCAA-3′, and 5′-GTCAA-3′, which differ only in the length of the primase recognition site. Reactions contained 1 mm ATP, 1 mm [α-32P]CTP (100 Ci/mol), and 50 nm primase fragment (determined using the monomer molecular weight). For each of these DNA templates, the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis was measured (as described under “Primase Assays”) at eight different concentrations of DNA ranging from 1 to 200 μm. The reaction rate was dependent on DNA concentration, and the data fit by linear regression to the equationv =V max[DNA]/K DNA + [DNA], where K DNA is the concentration of DNA at which the rate is half-maximum. The three templates bind the enzyme with approximately the same K DNA of 15 ± 5 μm. However, surprisingly the shortest template 5′-GTCAA-3′ supports a 5-fold higherV max than the two longer templates, which each support a similar V max. Fig. 1 shows the different rates of oligoribonucleotide synthesis supported by the templates 5′-TGGTCAA-3′, 5′-GGTCAA-3′, and 5′-GTCAA-3′. In this experiment, the concentration of the DNA template was held constant at 80 μm, and reactions were performed at various concentration of MgCl2 ranging from 0 mm (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) to 16 mm (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). Both the rate and the length of the products synthesized are dependent on the length of the template. In the presence of the template 5′-TGGTCAA-3′ (Fig. 1A), the primase fragment catalyzes the synthesis of di-, tri-, and tetraribonucucleotides, and oligoribonucleotide synthesis extends to the end of the DNA template. The oligoribonucleotides are truncated when shorter DNA templates are used. In the presence of 5′-GGTCAA-3′, the primase fragment synthesizes only di- and trinucleotides (Fig. 1B); in the presence of 5′-GTCAA-3′, only dimers are produced (Fig. 1C). The data indicate that when there is no other option, the primase fragment synthesizes dinucleotides quite rapidly. In the presence of longer DNA template sequences, the primase can either extend the dinucleotide or reinitiate the synthesis of another dinucleotide. As a result, under conditions allowing for dinucleotide extension, the overall rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis is actually lower than rate of synthesis of the dinucleotide. Previous reports have suggested that the 63-kDa gene 4 protein catalyzes the synthesis of dinucleotides in the absence of an added DNA template, albeit at a rate much lower than that observed in the presence of a template (21Mendelman L.V. Beauchamp B.B. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This DNA-independent dinucelotide synthesis is enhanced in the presence of MnCl2 (22Kusakabe T. Hine A.V. Hyberts S.G. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4295-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because only dinucleotides are synthesized by the gene 4 protein in the absence of DNA and the rate of this reaction is dependent on the nature of the divalent cation, divalent cations may play a different role in the synthesis of dinucleotides than in the extension of dinucleotides. Consequently, we examined the rates of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide synthesis in reactions containing the primase fragment and various concentrations of divalent metal cations. In reactions lacking template, and containing from 0 to16 mm of either MgCl2 or MnCl2, no oligoribonucleotide synthesis was detected (data not shown). We conclude that all oligoribonucleotide synthesis catalyzed by the primase fragment requires the presence of a DNA template. Perhaps the template-independent dinucleotide synthesis catalyzed by the full-length gene 4 protein results from an activity of the helicase domain. In support of this notion, the 56-kDa protein that lacks primase activity retains the Mn2+-dependent ability to synthesize dinucleotides (23Bernstein J.A. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is also possible that a slight contamination of the 63-kDa gene 4 protein with DNA led to these earlier observations. Unlike the primase fragment, which is readily separated from cellular DNA (14Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the full-length gene 4 protein binds tightly to DNA (24Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reactions containing template, it is clear that the rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis is dependent on the Mg2+concentration (Fig. 1). Similar rates were observed when MnCl2 was substituted for MgCl2 (data not shown). The amount of each product from each reaction shown in Fig. 1(A—C) was measured by phosphorimage analysis by comparing the densities of each spot with the density resulting from known amounts of [α-32P]CTP and corrected for the number of labeled nucleotides in each oligoribonucleotide. After measuring the total amounts of dimer (pppAC), trimer (pppACC), and tetramer (pppACCA), the rates of total nucleotide incorporation were calculated at each concentration of Mg2+ for each reaction in the presence of each template tested (Fig. 1 D). Regardless whether the template supports only dimer synthesis, dimer and trimer synthesis, or the synthesis of all three products, theK m for Mg2+ remains constant at about 2 mm, suggesting that Mg2+ plays a similar role in the synthesis of all three products. Moreover, the relative amounts of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide products do not vary as a function of divalent metal ion concentration, indicating that Mg2+ does not alter the processivity of the enzyme. In the presence of the template 5′-GTCAA-3′, 100% of the products detected are dinucleotides (Fig. 1 C). In the presence of 5′-GGTCAA-3′, about half of the products are dinucleotides, and half are trinucleotides (Fig. 1 B). However, in the presence of the template 5′-GGGTCAA-3′, most of the products are dinucleotides and tetranucleotides, whereas only a small amount are trinucleotides (Fig. 1 A). Because of the striking difference in the relative amounts of the di- and trinucleotide products, we next examined the ratios of the various products formed on longer DNA templates. On a natural DNA template such as M13 ssDNA, the gene 4 synthesized primers used by the T7 polymerase are mainly tetraribonucleotides (1Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With synthetic DNA templates, T7 primase can synthesize longer oligoribonucleotides on templates containing long stretches of dG residues 5′ to the recognition sequence (25Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5943-5951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To reexamine this reaction in the absence of the helicase domain, the activity of the primase fragment was examined in the presence of longer DNA templates in which the template was extended on the 5′-end by the addition of dG residues. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, the primase fragment was incubated in the presence of [α-32P]CTP, ATP, and five different DNA templates in which the 5′-end was extended by additional dG residues. Aliquots of each reaction were quenched after 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, and 5 min, and the products were separated from [α-32P]CTP by gel electrophoresis. Indeed, the primase fragment retains the ability to synthesize longer oligoribonucleotides on templates containing stretches of guanosine residues 5′ to the primase recognition site. Moreover, the total amount of all the products observed was linear over the time course of the experiment, and the overall rate of oligoribonucleotide synthesis on all of the templates varied less than 2-fold. The amount of NMPs incorporated into each product was divided by the total amount of NMPs incorporated into all of the products detected. This value gives an estimate of the frequency with which synthesis is aborted after the synthesis of that particular oligoribonucleotide product. For example, in most reactions, approximately 30% of the NMPs are incorporated into dinucleotides, indicating that 30% of reactions stop after synthesis of the dimer. This value for the various products remained constant over the time course of the experiment, indicating that the shorter products are not synthesized first and then extended, which confirms that the shorter products result from abortive primer synthesis. To more concisely report the results of the data from this experiment, the percentages of each product at each time point were averaged, and the averages are reported in Fig. 2. These data show that, although the primase fragment will synthesize oligoribonucleotides to the end of DNA containing a primase recognition site, the frequency of abortive primers increases with the length of the template. In reactions containing the DNA template 5′-GGGTCAA-3′, 68% of the NMPs are incorporated into the tetramer pppACCC, and 20% are incorporated into the dinucleotide. Less than 6% of the NMPs are incorporated into the trimers, and a small amount (4%) of NMPs are incorporated into pentamers pppACCCA and pppACCCC. When the DNA template is lengthened by a single nucleotide on the 5′-end, the major product of the primase reaction is now a pentamer (pppACCCC). The next most common product is the dimer (34%), and less than 10% of the NMPs are incorporated into the trimers and tetramers. Only a small amount (2%) of the NMPs are incorporated into a hexamer, in which the last nucleotide is untemplated pppACCCC(A/C). Similar results were obtained for longer DNA templates. Each time, when the template is extended another base, the products are extended by one nucleotide. The most obvious trend in these data is that fewer full-length products are synthesized on longer DNA templates (Fig. 2), suggesting that the ultimate length of oligoribonucleotides synthesized by the primase is limited. Secondly, of all the abortive products observed, the dimers are always the most common and account for 30 ± 10% of the products regardless of the length of the DNA template. This accumulation of dinucleotides provides evidence that the dinucleotide is synthesized more rapidly than it is extended. To determine the kinetic constants describing the binding of the initiating NTPs to the enzyme, the T7 primase fragment (12.5 nm) was incubated with the DNA template 5′-GTCAAA-3′ (65 μm) at six different concentrations of ATP ranging from 0.033 to 3 mm, and six different concentrations of [α-32P]CTP (100 Ci/mol) from 0.1 to 3.2 mm. Under these conditions, the only product of the reaction, pppAC, can be separated from [α-32P]CTP using PAGE and then measured by phosphorimage analysis. The rate of dinucleotide synthesis is clearly hyperbolically dependent on ATP or CTP concentration (Fig. 3 A). To distinguish between the three basic bisubstrate kinetic mechanisms, the data were fit to the equations describing ping-pong and both ordered and random bisubstrate reactions. To obtain initial estimates of the kinetic constants needed for regression analysis, the data in Fig. 3 A was initially fit to the Michaelis-Menton equation:v =V max[NTP]/K m + [NTP]. This analysis yields an apparent K m andV max for each concentration ATP and CTP, and secondary plots of the apparent K m values andV max values provide estimates of the kinetic constants. Because the K m values of ATP or CTP can be defined as the K m of one NTP at infinite concentrations of the other NTP (Fig. 3 B), these values were determined by plotting apparent V max values for one NTP at specific concentrations of the other NTP. This method yields a K m (CTP) of 1.1 mm, aK m (ATP) of 0.63 mm, and ak cat for dimer synthesis of 5.2 s−1(assuming one active site/protein monomer). A linear extrapolation of a secondary plot showing the 1/K m (app) of ATP at different CTP concentrations yields a K s (ATP) of 0.1 mm, and a plot of 1/K m (app) of CTP versus ATP yields a K s (CTP) of 0.2 mm. Using these initial estimates, all of the data in Fig. 3 were fit by nonlinear regression analysis (26Hernandez A. Ruiz M.T. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to the appropriate equations describing ping-pong, ordered, and random bisubstrate mechanisms. The data fit best to an equation describing a random bisubstrate reaction as judged by minimal least squares and variances of fit, a χ2 test of one, and minimal, random positive and negative residuals. The refined constants are shown on the kinetic scheme shown in Fig. 3 B, and curves generated using these constants are shown along with the data in Fig. 3 A. The enzyme binds ATP 2.6-fold more tightly than CTP, suggesting that at equal molar concentration of ATP and CTP, ATP will bind first. Moreover, there is a small 2.7-fold decrease in the affinity of the primase for the second substrate if the first NTP is already bound. The biological significance of this kinetic mechanism remains unclear, but at the high physiological concentrations of ATP (>5 mm), ATP may be perpetually bound to the primase, making primer initiation particularly sensitive to cellular CTP concentrations. After the synthesis of the dinucleotide, the next step in primer synthesis involves the extension of the dinucleotide to the tetranucleotide, which functions as a primer for T7 DNA polymerase (1Scherzinger E. Lanka E. Hillenbrand G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4151-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To examine the regulation of dinucleotide extension, the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides on templates containing the recognition sequence 5′-GGGTC-3′ was examined under various conditions. An interesting result was obtained when the double titration of the primase fragment with ATP and CTP was repeated using the template 5′-GGGTCAAAAA-3′. The di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide products were each dependent on the concentration of ATP and CTP (Fig. 4). As was seen previously (Figs. 1 and 2), the two major products are a dimer and a tetramer, and the amount of trimer detected was quite low compared with the amounts of either dimer or tetramer. Fig. 4 A shows the rates of dimer, trimer, and tetramer formation when the amount of ATP was held constant at 2 mm. At all concentrations of CTP tested, the amount of trimer formed was substantially less than the amount of either dimer or tetramer observed. It is noteworthy that the rate of tetramer formation was lower than the rate of dimer formation at concentrations of CTP less than 1 mm. The rate of tetramer formation increases with incre"

U8 snoRNP is functionally unique. It is the only known snoRNP that has been shown to be essential for processing of both 5.8 and 28 S rRNAs. These two RNAs, together with 5 S RNA, make up the RNA components of the large ribosomal subunit. Conversely, in yeast and vertebrates, a total of six snoRNAs have been shown to affect processing of the 18 S rRNA, the only rRNA present in the small ribosomal subunit. To date, no snoRNA other than U8 and no additional trans-acting cleavage or accessory proteins have been identified that are required in vertebrates for processing of both 5.8 and 28 S rRNAs. The nucleolus contains a large number of snoRNPs. Over 100 different species of snoRNAs have been identified in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and vertebrates (reviewed in Refs. 1Maxwell E.S.

These snoRNAs can be placed in two groups based on function. The vast majority of the snoRNAs are involved in directing site-specific posttranscriptional modification of the rRNA, whereas just a handful are required for accurate cleavage of pre-rRNA. Within each functional group, the snoRNAs can be subdivided into two classes, based on common sequence elements and shared proteins; those of the C and D box class and those including the H/ACA sequences (reviewed in Refs. 4Peculis B.A. Mount S.M.

Most of these data have been obtained in yeast, and at the level of molecular biology, there is generally less information available regarding rRNA processing in vertebrates.

Whereas U8 is a C/D box snoRNA and presumably associates with the proteins described above, there must be trans-acting factors or U8-specific proteins that provide the uniquein vivo function of U8 RNA. Thus, we are examining the protein subunits of U8 RNP to identify the protein constituents and gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which U8 facilitates pre-rRNA processing. Here, we identify a protein that binds U8 snoRNA with high specificity. Conventional biochemical methods were used to enrich for U8-binding activity as measured in vitro. This novel 29-kDa protein was shown to bind U8 RNA specifically; it was efficiently cross-linked to U8 RNA, and neither associated with nor was its binding to U8 competed by other C and D box snoRNAs. This protein represents the first candidate for an integral component of U8 snoRNP, an essential nucleolar complex responsible for accumulation of mature large ribosomal subunits in vertebrates. Whole ovary was surgically removed from mature female frogs (obtained from Xenopus I; Dexter, MI) and minced. All subsequent steps were performed on ice. The minced tissue was washed ten times with ice-cold PBS buffer and allowed to settle for 3 min after each wash. After the final wash, the tube was centrifuged briefly at 1500 × g, and the volume of packed ovary was determined. The ovary was then washed once with three volumes of cold wash buffer (20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05 mm spermine, 0.12 mm spermidine, 200 ng/ml aprotonin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged again. Ovary was resuspended in one volume of break buffer (200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm spermine, 0.24 mm spermidine, 2 μg/ml aprotonin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% thiodiglycol) and transferred to a Dounce homogenizer (model 357546, Wheaton). Manual homogenization was performed by 10 strokes with the loose pestle followed by 3 strokes with the tight-fitting pestle. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant, typically 20–30 mg/ml total protein, was either used immediately or was stored at −80 °C with the addition of 30% glycerol (w/v; final concentration). The cleared ovary extract was brought to 30% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate and mixed gently at 4 °C for 3 h. The resulting slurry was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g. The 30% pellet was saved, and the resulting supernatant was then brought to 40% saturation with ammonium sulfate, then 50% and then 80% saturation in turn. The four ammonium sulfate pellets were resuspended in 110 the starting volume of ovary extract with Buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 2% (w/v) glycerol). The salt in the sample was decreased using a desalting column (model 43243, Pierce) that was previously equilibrated in Buffer I plus 50 mm NaCl. The 50–80% ammonium sulfate pellet fraction was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (7 ml) previously equilibrated with Buffer I plus 60 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer until the A 280 reached baseline (a minimum of 10 column volumes). The bound proteins were eluted with a 5-column volume linear gradient (60–300 mm NaCl) in Buffer I. Fractions that contained U8-binding activity as identified by gel shift analysis (see below) were pooled and used for further purification. Fractions containing peak U8-binding activity from the DEAE-Sepharose column were pooled then diluted with one volume of Buffer I and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (3 ml) equilibrated with Buffer I plus 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer until theA 280 reached baseline (typically 5 column volumes). Bound proteins were eluted with a 10-column volume linear salt gradient (100–300 mm NaCl) in Buffer I. One-half-ml fractions were collected and assayed for U8-binding activity using the gel shift assay as described below. Fractions that contained the highest U8-binding activity were examined and pooled for use in further purification steps. Fractions containing peak U8-binding activity were pooled and concentrated to 50 μl using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon) and applied to a Superdex S-75 column connected to a SMART chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in Buffer I plus 100 mm NaCl. The retention times/volumes of proteins were monitored by following the A 280 and processed with the software SMART MANAGER supplied by Pharmacia. Fractions were collected and analyzed for both U8 binding activity by gel shift analysis and protein complexity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Quantitative protein precipitation was performed essentially as per the method of Bensadoun and Weinstein (15Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. When the concentration of proteins was lower than 10 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. After 30 min on ice, cold trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 7% (w/v). The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The pellets were dissolved in SDS Laemmli buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE analysis. RNA binding assays were performed as described in Ref. 17Apostol B.L. Greer C.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar with the following modifications. Typically, binding reactions (5–14 μl) containing buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm spermidine, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 50 mm NaCl), yeast tRNA (109495, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (0.3–1.2 μg, corresponding to 200–800-fold molar excess), an aliquot of protein fraction (1–10 μl), and 60 fmol of32P-radiolabeled RNA. The mixture was incubated for 16 min at room temperature then loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (66:1 acrylamide:bis) containing 0.6× Tris-borate-EDTA and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The gel (14 × 14 × 0.75 cm) was run for 30 min at 210 V and 12 mA prior to loading. Electrophoresis was carried out at 12 mA constant current for 3 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried onto 3MM Whatman paper and exposed to x-ray film or to phosphorimaging plate (Fuji). [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA substrates were transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and purified as described previously (18Peculis B.A. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2241-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For UV cross-linking experiments, 4-thiouridine-substituted RNAs were generated as follows: in vitro transcription reactions contained final nucleotide concentrations of 0.4 mm GTP, 0.9 units GpppG cap analogue (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.4 mm CTP, 0.04 mm ATP, 0.015 mm UTP (all NTPs from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.03 mm 4-thiouridine triphosphate (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and 20 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3,000 mmol/Ci, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cross-linking reactions were assembled as per the binding reactions described above and contained a total of 60 μg of protein from the pooled heparin-Sepharose fractions and 18 ng of RNA. These reactions were incubated as described above (with/without cold competitor RNAs (60-fold molar excess as indicated)). After the binding incubation was complete, the reaction was exposed to 365-nm UV light (UVL-28, 8W lamp, UVP) at a distance of 3 cm for up to 30 min on ice. RNases A (1 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and T1 (1 unit/μl) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Bovine serum albumin was added (to a final concentration of 0.1%) as a carrier for trichloroacetic acid precipitation (final concentration, 7% (w/v)). The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. Protein pellets were resuspended in SDS Laemmli buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) into which 1 m Tris (pH 7.5) was added as needed until samples were neutralized. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and loaded on 13% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film or imaged with a Fuji phosphorimager. We previously reported that in vitro synthesized U8 RNA injected into Xenopus oocytes will form RNP particles that localize to the nucleus and function in pre-rRNA processing (18Peculis B.A. Steitz J.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2241-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Peculis B.A. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1233-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that exogenous U8 RNA serves as a substrate for RNP particle formation. In order to identify and characterize the proteins that bind U8 snoRNA and are involved in formation of U8 particles, we established conditions for a gel shift analysis that would serve as a functional assay for the presence of U8-specific binding proteins. Extracts made from Xenopus ovary were examined for the presence of proteins capable of binding U8 RNA. Binding reactions containing crude ovary extract, 32P-labeledXenopus U8 snoRNA, and nonspecific tRNA competitor were used to identify conditions for specific U8 complex formation in vitro. Fig. 1 shows a gel shift assay with crude Xenopus ovary extract and 3 ng of32P-labeled U8 RNA (Fig. 1, lane 2). Essentially all of the labeled RNA present in this reaction was shifted to a mobility consistent with an RNP complex; no unbound RNA was present (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). The addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled U8 RNA (lanes 3–6) or nonspecific 5 S (lanes 8–11) competitor RNA at 15-, 30-, 60-, or 120-fold molar excess prevented the formation of some but not all of the complexes. This indicated that some of the observed complexes represented nonspecific interactions, whereas others were due to the formation of more specific U8-containing complexes. This identification of complexes sensitive to competition with U8 RNA but not with 5 S RNA suggests that this assay provides a means of measuring specific binding to U8 RNA. The complexity of the band pattern observed in the gel shift analysis indicated that U8 RNA may be capable of forming complexes with several different protein factors. To identify specific U8-binding proteins, we focused on pooled fractions displaying U8 binding activity, as determined by gel shift analysis, and followed the binding activity through several fractionation steps. Thus, we generated a fractionation protocol that resulted in the identification of U8-specific binding protein of 29 kDa. This enrichment protocol is summarized in Fig. 2 and can be outlined as follows. Crude Xenopus ovary extract was fractionated by differential precipitation with ammonium sulfate. The desalted 0–30, 30–40, 40–50, and 50–80% ammonium sulfate pellets were assayed for U8 binding activity via gel shift analysis. Fig. 3 shows the binding activity present in each of these fractions. Lanes 2–6 each contain 10 μg of protein; however, the ability to shift a constant amount (3 ng) of U8 RNA differed dramatically for each fraction. These results indicated that proteins capable of interacting with U8 RNA were present in each of the ammonium sulfate fractions, but the identity and the abundance of these proteins presumably differed in each fraction. To determine which of the ammonium sulfate fractions should be the focus of additional purification, each of the four fractions was examined for specificity of U8 binding. Competition binding assays were performed with protein from each ammonium sulfate fraction in the presence of specific (U8) and nonspecific (tRNA and 5 S RNA) competitors (data not shown). These competition studies demonstrated that proteins in the 50–80% ammonium sulfate fraction appeared to be binding U8 RNA with high specificity generating at least two major complexes (designated complexes L and U in Fig. 3, lane 6). To further enrich for U8-binding activity in the 50–80% ammonium sulfate fraction, the proteins in this fraction were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column. Under the conditions used, most of the proteins flowed through the DEAE column, but the detectable U8-binding activity was present in the elution profile. The proteins/binding activities that generated the two U8 RNA complexes (Fig. 3, lane 6, U and L) could be separated from each other by elution with a linear salt gradient (data not shown, also see Fig. 4 and under “Experimental Procedures”). Fractions eluted from the DEAE column between approximately 160–200 mm NaCl contained proteins that generated complexes that comigrated in a native gel with the complex L seen in the 50–80% AS fraction. Complex L was not readily detectable in the crude extract (Fig. 1) but was clearly visible in the 50–80% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fig. 3, lane 6). The DEAE fractions containing U8 binding activities resulting in complex L formation (eluted at approximately 160–200 mmNaCl) were pooled separately from those forming complex U (eluted at approximately 210–300 mm NaCl). Each pool was examined separately for specificity by measuring the effects of tRNA competition on U8 binding, shown in Fig. 4. The L complex was found to be more resistant to tRNA competitor, consistent with greater specificity in binding (compare Fig. 4, lanes 2–6 and 7–11). Additional competition binding assays were performed using specific (sense strand U8) or nonspecific (5 S) RNAs to further determine the specificity of U8 binding (data not shown). These data further supported the conclusion that the L complex demonstrated higher specificity for U8 binding. Thus, we chose to pursue the protein(s) responsible for L complex formation. As a next step in the enrichment of U8-binding proteins, those fractions from the DEAE column that contained maximal L complex formation activity were pooled. This pool was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column. The U8-binding activity was retained on the column, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100–300 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 A). Fractions eluted from this column were analyzed by gel shift analysis for the ability to bind U8 RNA (Fig. 5 B). The gel shift assay clearly demonstrated only one peak of U8-binding activity, which resulted in a shifted band that comigrated with complex L (Fig. 5 B, fractions 29–35). Those fractions with peak U8-binding activity were pooled, and an aliquot of pooled material was examined by SDS-PAGE. Examination of the protein composition indicated that although the pattern was less complex than previous steps, a number of major protein bands were detected by silver staining (data not shown, but refer to Fig. 8,lane 4).FIG. 8SDS-PAGE analysis of proteins inXenopus ovary extract and purified fractions. An aliquot of proteins from each step in the U8-binding protein enrichment were resolved on a 13% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining.Lane 1, total proteins from crude Xenopus ovary extract (7 μg); lane 2, 50–80% ammonium sulfate (AS) fraction (5.5 μg); lane 3, DEAE-Sepharose fractions with peak U8 binding activity(2 μg); lane 4,heparin-Sepharose column fractions with peak activity (2 μg);lane 5, the fraction containing peak binding activity from a Superdex S-75 analytical gel filtration column (0.5 μg). Lane 6 contains markers with molecular masses indicated at the right. The arrow at the left indicates the mobility of the X29 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To correlate U8 binding activity with one or just a few bands, the extent of binding activity in each fraction across a heparin-Sepharose profile was determined by gel shift assay. Proteins in the corresponding fraction were examined by SDS-PAGE, and a portion of this gel is shown in Fig. 5 C. The binding activity as measured by gel shift assay (shown above Fig. 5 C) best corresponded to the elution profile of a 29-kDa band detected by SDS-PAGE. To test whether the 29-kDa protein present in the heparin-Sepharose fraction was responsible for the U8 binding activityin vitro, UV cross-linking experiments were performed. U8 RNA was transcribed in the presence of 32P-ATP and 4-thiouridine, a photoactivatable nucleotide analogue. To examine whether the presence of 4-thiouridine affected the mobility efficiency or specificity of complex formation complex L formed with 4-thiouridine, 32P-ATP-labeled U8 RNA was examined in a native gel. The mobility of the 4-thiouridine-containing complex was indistinguishable from the mobility of the complex assembled on the32P UTP-labeled U8 RNA (data not shown). Competition assays performed using the 4-thiouridine U8 RNA indicated that the presence of 4-thiouridine had no effect on the apparent binding affinity as measured by gel shift analysis (data not shown). Standard reactions containing 4-thiouridine, 32P-labeled U8 RNA and heparin-Sepharose pooled fractions were irradiated with 365 nm light as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then digested with RNases A and T1. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to film. Only one protein-RNA complex was visualized by autoradiography, migrating at approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 6, lane 2). Formation of this complex was protein-dependent; this band was not seen in the absence of added protein (lane 1). Proteinase K treatment of a sample after irradiation abolished this band (data not shown). Formation of the U8 RNA-protein cross-linked complex was significantly inhibited in the presence of 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled U8 RNA competitor (Fig. 6, lane 3) but was not affected by an equivalent amount of nonspecific competitor, 5 S RNA (lane 4). To determine the specificity of the cross-linked protein for U8 RNA, a comparable 4-thiouridine32P-ATP-labeled 5 S RNA was generated and subjected to identical cross-linking conditions. No specific cross-linking was observed with this RNA (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). These data provide additional evidence for a U8-specific RNA-binding protein. To examine 1) whether the U8 binding activity could be directly assigned to the 29-kDa protein identified from the heparin-Sepharose elution profile (see Fig. 5); and 2) whether the U8 binding activity required the presence of additional proteins in this fraction, an analytical scale Superdex S-75 gel filtration column was used to further resolve the proteins in this fraction. The active U8-binding fractions from a heparin-Sepharose column were pooled and concentrated and then loaded onto a Superdex S-75 column on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART system. Each fraction eluted from the column was analyzed for the ability to bind U8 RNA by gel shift assay (Fig. 7 A) and examined for protein content by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7 B). Most of the U8-binding activity was eluted in two consecutive fractions (Fig. 7 B, lanes 6 and 7) with trace amounts of this binding activity eluting in the following two fractions (lanes 8 and 9). The profile of the binding activity closely correlates with the elution profile of the 29-kDa protein and does not correlate well with any other visible bands on the gel. Cross-linking to 4-thiouridine U8 was then used to examine which of the proteins present in the Superdex S-75 column fraction corresponding tolane 7 in Fig. 7 B was responsible for U8 binding activity. Cross-linking was performed as described above (and see under “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting pattern of cross-linking was identical to that observed for the heparin-Sepharose pool (Fig. 5); a single protein band of approximately 30 kDa was labeled (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly implicate the 29-kDa protein in direct binding to U8 RNA. To examine the enrichment for the U8-binding protein identified here, protein from each of the purification steps was examined by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 8 shows the protein complexity of each step. The final step of purification, containing protein from the Superdex S-75 column fraction corresponding to Fig. 7 B, lane 7 above, contains one major protein species and only very small amounts of other polypeptides (Fig. 8,lane 5). We call this 29-kDa Xenopus protein X29. In order to examine the template specificity of the X29 protein, pooled fractions from the heparin-Sepharose column were used for gel shift assays using different snoRNAs as templates. Because U8 is a member of the subclass of snoRNAs containing common sequence elements, the C and D box, it is possible that other snoRNAs also bind X29. Gel shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled U3 and U14 snoRNAs and proteins in the pooled heparin-Sepharose fractions. No specific binding to either U3 or U14 was detected (data not shown). Thus, the X29 protein has a much higher affinity for U8 than for other C and D box snoRNAs. To provide further evidence for U8 specificity, the ability of trace-labeled U3 and U14 snoRNAs to compete for U8-binding was examined. Fig. 9 shows the results from some of these competition experiments. Labeled U8 RNA (Fig. 9,lane 1) and the shifted complex L (lane 2) are indicated. The addition of 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled sense strand U8 RNA (lane 3) to the binding reaction greatly inhibited complex formation. The inhibition is complete in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled U8 RNA competitor (lane 4). Addition of a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of nonspecific 5 S competitor (lanes 9 and 10) does not affect complex L formation. Lanes 5 and 6 show U8 RNA complex formation in the presence of 50- and 100-fold molar excess, respectively, of cold U3 RNA. The presence of U3 RNA in the binding reaction had no detectable effect on the formation of complex L. Likewise, U14 snoRNA present as cold competitor (lanes 7 and8) failed to compete effectively for binding. These data provide additional evidence that the X29 protein had a much higher affinity for U8 than for other C and D box snoRNAs. Thus, the X29 protein identified in Xenopus ovary extracts is unlikely to be common to all C and D box snoRNPs and may be specific to the U8 RNP alone. We have used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to detect proteins in Xenopus ovary extracts that interact with U8 snoRNA. We have identified a 29-kDa protein that copurifies with U8-binding activity as measured by both gel mobility shift assay and by UV cross-linking to U8 RNA. The specificity of binding has been demonstrated by competition assays using tRNA, 5 S RNA, and U3 and U14 snoRNAs as competitors. Only the U8 snoRNA binds X29 with high specificity. This is the first U8-specific protein identified; it may aid our understanding of how the U8 snoRNA directs the processing of the large subunit RNAs. To date, U8 is the only vertebrate snoRNA shown to be essential for maturation of both 5.8 and 28 S rRNAs. In contrast, genetic or biochemical depletion of U3, U14, U22, or snR30 results in the absence of mature 18 S rRNA without affecting processing of either 5.8 or 28 S rRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 897-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Characterization of U8 snoRNP, particularly its unique components, may allow identification of other factors involved in vertebrate large subunit rRNA processing and factors specific for this portion of the rRNA processing pathway. By analogy to other snoRNPs, the U8 particle might be expected to contain both common and unique protein constituents. For example, those snoRNAs containing the C and D box sequence elements associate with three proteins constituting common components of their RNPs. One of these, fibrillarin (known as Nop1p in yeast), is very well conserved across evolution (20Amiri K.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2124-2127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Jansen R.P. Hurt E.C. Kern H. Lehtonen H. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lapeyre B. Tollervey D. J.

However, fibrillarin does not appear to directly contact the snoRNA (25Watkins N.J. Leverette R.D. Xia L. Andrews M.T. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 1996; 2: 118-133PubMed Google Scholar), and its association with several snoRNAs is salt-dependent (19Peculis B.A. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1233-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,26Tyc K. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The majority of the snoRNAs that associate with fibrillarin/Nop1p are involved in the site-specific methylation of rRNA (reviewed in Ref.2Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The exceptions are U3, U8, U14, U22, and snR30, which are essential for pre-rRNA processing (reviewed in Ref. 1Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 897-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The second protein, Nop5/Nop58p, was recently identified as a common C and D box protein required for snoRNA stability in yeast (6Lafontaine D.L. Tollervey D. RNA. 1999; 5: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The third shared protein, Nop56, is another yeast protein that binds all the C and D box snoRNAs examined (7Wu P. Brockenbrough J.S. Metcalfe A.C. Chen S. Aris J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16453-16463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The vertebrate homologues of these proteins have been identified in mouse (11Watkins N.J. Newman D.R. Kuhn J.F. Maxwell E.S. RNA. 1998; 4: 582-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These shared subunits may have functions common to a variety of particles, so their analysis might not provide insight into function unique to a particular snoRNP. For this reason, we have chosen to focus on identifying proteins unique to U8 snoRNP. The identification of RNP proteins can help confirm putative activities and may lead to insight about additional roles in vivo. An example of this can be seen in the previous characterization of proteins specific to the H/ACA class of snoRNPs (3Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Gar1p was identified as a protein common to a distinct subset of snoRNPs (27Girard J.P. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) subsequently shown to comprise the H/ACA class of RNPs (8Ganot P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 941-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Anti-Gar1 antibodies were found to co-immunoprecipitate Cbf5p, which was also found to be a common H/ACA protein subunit (10Lafontaine D.L.J. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Watkins N.J. Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Kastner B. Fabrizio P. Mann M. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1998; 4: 1549-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The protein Cbf5p is a putative rRNA pseudouridine synthase, and in yeast, it appears to be necessary for both H/ACA snoRNA stability and for pseudouridylation of rRNA (10Lafontaine D.L.J. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 29Cadwell C. Yoon H.J. Zebarjadian Y. Carbon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6175-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Homologs of this protein have been identified in several other species, including rat (the NAP57 protein) (30Meier U.T. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1505-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), Drosophila (minifly, or the mfl gene) (31Giordano E. Peluso I. Senger S. Furia M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and human (DKC1 gene) (32Heiss N.S. Knight S.W. Vulliamy T.J. Klauck S.M. Wiemann S. Mason P.J. Poustka A. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Mutations in the DKC1gene in human have been linked to the disease dyskeratosis congenita (29Cadwell C. Yoon H.J. Zebarjadian Y. Carbon J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6175-6183Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Heiss N.S. Knight S.W. Vulliamy T.J. Klauck S.M. Wiemann S. Mason P.J. Poustka A. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). This example illustrates how characterization of a distinct component of an RNP family can provide insights into the functions of the members of that family and to its distribution in a wide variety of organisms. The X29 protein reported here has not previously been characterized inXenopus (based on mass spectrometry analysis and protein size) or in other organisms (based on preliminary protein sequence data). The RNA binding properties of the protein suggest that it may be unique to U8. Thus, learning the identity of the Xenopus29-kDa protein and identifying homologues in other species may provide information and insight into additional roles for the U8 RNP in vivo and facilitate the identification of U8 homologues in other species. The ability to cross-link this protein to the RNA indicates a close and direct RNA-protein interaction between U8 and X29. The ability to generate a protein-RNA complex with proteins present in several of the fractions from the Superdex S-75 column indicates either that the X29 alone can bind U8 RNA or that an apparently substoichiometric amount of other assembly factors is present and sufficient for assembly. Isolation of a cDNA clone and expression of recombinant X29 protein are being used to examine these possibilities. X29 is only one of potentially several U8-binding proteins. The mobility gel shift assay performed with crude Xenopusextract clearly indicated several specific complexes could assemble on U8 RNA (see Fig. 1). The two complexes, L and U, were not visible in the crude extract (shown in Fig. 1). However, in the elution profile from the DEAE column (see Fig. 4) they were clearly identified and U8-specific. Thus, gel mobility shift assay has provided evidence for a number of U8-binding proteins. Because U8 is a C and D box snoRNP, we would expect the three common C and D box proteins previously described (reviewed in Ref. 3Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) to also be part of the U8 RNP. By analogy to other snoRNPs, we would predict the presence of several U8-binding proteins, some shared common proteins, others unique to U8. The U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle has nine shared common proteins and three proteins unique to U1 (reviewed in Ref. 33Klein Gunnewiek J.M.T. van de Putte L.B.A. van Venrooij W.J. Clin. Exp. Rheum. 1997; 15: 549-560PubMed Google Scholar). The U3 snoRNP was reported to include seven proteins (34Parker K.A. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2899-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). From the size of U8 in sedimentation gradients (10 S particle in humans) (26Tyc K. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3113-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we would predict that approximately six to eight proteins may be present. The X29 protein described here is the first report of a protein component of a snoRNA involved in processing of the RNAs comprising the large ribosomal subunit. Learning more about the proteins that associate with U8 and identifying the sequence specificity and U8 binding sites of these proteins will provide more insight into how the U8 RNP is assembled and functions. This information could allow us to learn more about other roles and cellular functions of the U8 RNP. We thank Anita Israel Tomasevic for assistance on the early cross-linking studies, Chris Greer for many helpful discussions over the course of these experiments, and Chris Greer, Vera Nikodem, and Colette Cote for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2050016558,"Prenylated proteins contain either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid covalently attached to cysteine residues at or near their C terminus. These proteins constitute up to 2% of total cellular protein in eukaryotic cells. The degradation of prenylated proteins raises a metabolic challenge to the cell, because the thioether bond of the modified cysteine is quite stable. We recently identified and isolated an enzyme termed prenylcysteine lyase that cleaves the prenylcysteine to free cysteine and an isoprenoid product (Zhang, L., Tschantz, W. R., and Casey, P. J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 23354–23359). To facilitate the molecular characterization of this enzyme, its cloning was undertaken. Overlapping cDNA clones encoding the complete coding sequence of this enzyme were obtained from a human cDNA library. The open reading frame of the gene encoding prenylcysteine lyase is 1515 base pairs and has a nearly ubiquitous expression pattern with a message size of 6 kilobase pairs. Recombinant prenylcysteine lyase was produced in a baculovirus-Sf9 expression system. Analysis of both the recombinant and native enzyme revealed that the enzyme is glycosylated and contains a signal peptide that is cleaved during processing. Additionally, the subcellular localization of this enzyme was determined to be lysosomal. These findings strengthen the notion that prenylcysteine lyase plays an important role in the final step in the degradation of prenylated proteins and will allow further physiological and biochemical characterization of this enzyme.

Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). One such type of lipid modification is termed prenylation, in which proteins are modified by either a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid moieties (2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 3Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These prenyl groups are covalently attached to a cysteine residue(s) at or near the C terminus of proteins via a thioether bond (1Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 4Marshall C.J. Science. 1993; 259: 1865-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). A subset of prenylated proteins, termed CAAX proteins, are further modified after the prenylation step. In these proteins, the cysteine residue that is prenylated is initially present as the fourth residue from the C terminus. After prenylation, the three residues after the prenylated cysteine (i.e. the AAX) are proteolytically removed, and the new C-terminal prenylcysteine is modified by methylation (5Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar,6Ashby M.N. Curr. Opinion Lipidol. 1998; 9: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unlike many other post-translational protein modifications, prenylation is a stable modification of the protein (7Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Prenylated proteins have an approximate half-life of 20 h and constitute ∼2% of total cellular protein (7Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 8Epstein W.W. Lever D. Leining L.M. Bruenger E. Rilling H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9668-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The relatively short half-life of prenyl proteins, along with the stability of the modification, raises a particular metabolic challenge to the cell in the disposal of prenylcysteines resulting from the normal turnover of prenylated proteins. Free prenylcysteines and select analogs have pronounced pharmacological effects on cells, including disruption of cellular signaling that may be attributable to the aberrant localization of specific prenyl proteins (9Philips M.R.

Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Another type of post-translational modification, S-acylation, presumably raises a similar metabolic challenge to the cell if the palmitoyl group is not removed from palmitoylated proteins. Recently, a lysosomal enzyme termed palmitoyl protein thioesterase has been shown to remove the palmitoyl group from thiol-containing compounds that appear to result from degradation of palmitoylated proteins (12Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lu J.Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interestingly, defects in this enzyme have been implicated in the neurodegenerative disease infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disorder (14Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In an ongoing effort to elucidate the metabolic fate of prenylcysteines in cells, we recently identified an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of prenylcysteines that we have dubbed prenylcysteine lyase (PCLase;1 Ref. 15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This enzyme was isolated from bovine brain membranes, a tissue rich in prenylated proteins. PCLase catalyzes the degradation of prenylcysteines to yield free cysteines and a hydrophobic isoprenoid product. The enzyme does this in a manner that is distinct from other enzymes such as carbon sulfur β-lyase, cytochrome P450, and flavin-containing monooxygenases that have been previously shown to act on prenylcysteines (15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, PCLase exhibits a significantly lower K m and higher specificity for prenylcysteines than either the β-lyase or the monooxygenases. Another potential route that has been identified for the cellular disposal of prenylcysteines is by transport out of the cell via P-glycoprotein (16Zhang L. Sachs C.W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15973-15976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Zhang L. Sachs C.W. Fu H.-W. Fine R.L. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22859-22865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although it seems unlikely that this process is a primary mode of prenylcysteine removal, because P-glycoprotein is not ubiquitously expressed (18Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar, 19Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2017) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that PCLase is the major mechanism by which cells dispose of prenylcysteines. In the present study, the cloning, primary structure, expression pattern, and cellular localization of PCLase are reported. The enzyme was cloned from a human brain cDNA library, and recombinant enzyme was produced in an Sf9 expression system for analysis. Additional studies revealed that PCLase is glycosylated and is localized to the lysosomal compartment in cells. This study provides insights into the role(s) of PCLase and how this enzyme might be involved in the cellular metabolism of prenylated proteins. PCLase was purified from the membrane fraction of bovine brain as described previously (15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing was performed at both the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Briefly, 13 μg of purified bovine brain PCLase was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and the gel slice containing the protein was excised and subjected to trypsin treatment in situ. Peptides were extracted from the gel, purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and then subjected to Edman degradation. In all, the sequence of six internal peptides was determined. In addition, the N-terminal sequence of the mature protein was determined by sequencing an aliquot of the protein before trypsin digestion. Standard cloning techniques were used throughout these procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Degenerate PCR oligonucleotides were designed using the peptide sequences generated from the Edman degradation reactions. mRNA (bovine brain poly(A)+; CLONTECH) was reverse-transcribed using an Advantage reverse transcription-to-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit (CLONTECH) and used as the source of the DNA in a series of degenerate PCR reactions; a specific DNA product of 159 base pairs (bp) was obtained from the primer pair based on the peptide sequences of internal peptides, termed Int 3 and Int 4 (see Table I). After the sequencing of that product, the DNA sequence was extended by using a specific sense primer near the 3′ end of the 159-bp product in conjunction with a degenerate antisense primer to the peptide Int 6; this reaction generated a 684-bp product. The combined sequences were queried against GenBank and Expressed Sequence Tag data bases, and similarity was observed to several partial human sequences in GenBank. Using these human sequences, a specific sense primer was generated in a region found to encompass residues 158–163 of PCLase. The Gene Trap method was then used following the manufacturer's instructions; the Superscript human brain cDNA library was used (Life Technologies). All clones obtained via this procedure were determined by in vitro translation (TNT system; Promega) to be missing their initiating methionine, and 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE) was then used to obtain the 5′ end using human brain poly(A)+ mRNA (CLONTECH) (21Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Johnson G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar); a 5′ RACE product containing the 5′ end of the cDNA (see “Results”) was obtained and subcloned into a partial cDNA clone from the Gene Trap using a unique Nru1 site near the 5′ end of the open reading frame. This final vector was termed pCMV-Sport/PCLase and contained the entire open reading frame of PCLase.Table ISequence of peptides from bovine brain PCLasePeptideAmino acid sequenceN-TermEPYAPPEKIAVIGAGIGGTSAAYYLRInt 1IDVFEKLYERInt 2NVNTQMIVQInt 3YQSHDYAFSSVEKInt 4FLDEIITPVMRInt 5INSIGLVSPEEYNInt 6ADTAHVWK Open table in a new tab A Multiple Choice blot (Origene) was used to examine the expression of PCLase mRNA in several tissues. A random-primed DNA probe was made using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Standard techniques were used (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), and β-actin expression was examined in a similar manner to ensure the integrity of the mRNA. Two polyclonal antibodies to PCLase were generated for use in characterizing the enzyme. One antibody was raised against an N-terminal peptide, EPYAPPEKIAVIGAC, from bovine PCLase and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antiserum obtained from immunized rabbits was subjected to affinity purification on a column of immobilized peptide; this antibody was designated AP1752. The second antibody was raised against a fusion protein constructed by fusing residues 150–505 of the human PCLase to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase. The resultant fusion protein was found primarily in inclusion bodies when expressed inEscherichia coli. For antibody production, the insoluble fraction of E. coli cells expressing the fusion protein was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% sodium cholate and 1 mm EDTA. The insoluble fraction obtained after this wash was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6 m urea and 1 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dialysate was then subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was then used as the source of antigen. The antiserum obtained from rabbits was affinity-purified by passing it first over a glutathione S-transferase affinity column to remove antibodies that recognize glutathione S-transferase epitopes and then followed by passage over an affinity column of immobilized glutathione S-transferase-PCLase fusion protein. The resulting low pH elution contained antibodies that recognized PCLase epitopes and was designated AP130. Purified bovine PCLase (300 ng) was denatured by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 5% SDS containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and treated with the deglycosylating enzymes endoglycosidase H and peptideN-glycosidase F using protocols supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the digestion mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and PCLase migration was determined by immunoblot analysis using the AP1752 antibody. In vitrotranslation was performed using the TNT reticulocyte lysate in vitrotranscription-translation kit (Promega) in the presence and absence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega); the microsomes are required for both glycosylation and removal of the signal peptide of the newly synthesized protein. The pCMV-Sport/PCLase vector carrying the full-length PCLase cDNA was used in the reaction, and transcription driven via the SP6 promoter was performed using35S-Translabel (ICN) as the label. After a 90-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was split, and half was subjected to deglycosylation by endoglycosidase H as described above. Proteins from both samples were then resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and identified by fluorography. A recombinant baculovirus transfer vector was constructed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Life Technologies). The entire open reading frame of human PCLase was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase with SalI and NotI linkers at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR product was then digested and ligated into pFastbac, and the sequence was verified. This vector, termed pFastbac/PCLase, was then used for transposition in DH10Bac E. coli cells. After selection for transposition, the bacmid was isolated and transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin transfection reagent (Life Technologies), and the virus was isolated. A spinner culture of Sf9 cells in 500 ml of Grace's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% plurionic was seeded at a density of 1 million cells/ml and then infected with either the virus carrying PCLase virus or a control virus. Cells were harvested 52 h after infection, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, containing a mix of protease inhibitors; Ref. 22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were disrupted using a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and the suspension was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and protein concentration was determined. Membranes were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. The synthesis of35S-farnesylcysteine was performed as described (15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The synthesis reaction used [35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products; packaged with dithiothreitol as a protectant) at a final specific activity of 0.4 Ci/mmol. A 5-fold excess (relative to the total thiol concentration) of farnesyl bromide (Aldrich) was used in the reaction, which proceeded essentially to completion. The 35S-farnesylcysteine was then purified by HPLC, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in Me2SO for storage at −20 °C. To examine the time course of product formation, a bulk reaction containing 7 μm35S-farnesylcysteine (∼50,000 cpm/time point) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C was initiated by the addition of either PCLase or control membranes (10 μg/time point). At the times indicated in the appropriate figure legends, 20-μl aliquots were removed, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of chromatography development solvent (n-propanol:NH4OH:H2O, 6:3:1). Samples were applied to Whatman LK6D Silica Gel 60 TLC plates, and the plates were then developed in the same solvent system. After development, the plates were sprayed with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to x-ray film for fluorographic visualization. Both the farnesylcysteine substrate and cysteine product were scraped from the plates and quantitated by scintillation spectroscopy. For other assays, identical reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl with the protein concentration noted in the appropriate figure legends. Reactions were terminated and processed as described above. The following procedures were all performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Bovine liver (2.5 g) was homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a glass-Teflon homogenizer (10 strokes at 600 rpm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was subjected to a 12,500 ×g centrifugation for 15 min. The membrane pellet from this procedure was resuspended in the same buffer and mixed with an equal volume of 40% Optiprep (Nycomed) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm EDTA and 80 mm sucrose. The sample was loaded into a 30-ml centrifuge tube, overlaid with homogenization buffer, and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW28 rotor for 3 h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube and assayed for catalase (peroxisomal marker), α-mannosidase II (golgi marker), and cytochromec oxidase (mitochondrial marker) as described (23Storrie B. Madden F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Additionally, acid phosphatase activity (lysosomal marker; Ref. 24Graham J.M. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 51-57Google Scholar) and PCLase activities (see above) were determined. HEK293 cells were seeded at a low density on glass coverslips and allowed to grow for 1 day, whereupon the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and then treated with 10% calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline (IF buffer) for 10 min to block nonspecific binding sites. The fixed cells were incubated with PCLase antiserum AP130 and an anti-mouse lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) antibody (a lysosomal resident protein) in IF buffer containing 0.2% saponin for 1 h. The cells were washed three times for 3 min each in IF buffer, whereupon the secondary antibodies were added (goat anti-rabbit Oregon Green conjugate and goat anti-mouse Texas Red conjugate (Molecular Probes) for PCLase and LAMP1, respectively) in IF buffer containing 0.2% saponin, and incubation continued for 1 h. Cells were washed again three times in IF buffer, and the coverslips were inverted onto a drop of Slow Fade (Molecular Probes) on a glass slide and sealed. Microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal microscope. Cells were imaged using a 63× magnification oil immersion lens at 488 nm and 568 nm to excite the Oregon Green and Texas Red conjugates, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega). Peptide sequences that were identified from N-terminal analysis and tryptic extracts of purified bovine PCLase are presented in Table I. To initiate the cloning of PCLase, a PCR approach was taken (see “Experimental Procedures”), which resulted in the generation of a 684-bp PCR product. Several of the peptides identified from the peptide sequencing were found encoded in the 684-bp product, indicating that a partial cDNA encoding the bovine PCLase had been obtained. Queries to GenBank revealed similarities to several human expressed sequence tags and also to a region of the noncoding strand of an enzyme termed bile salt-activated lipase (see “Discussion”). Using the sequence of the human PCLase as a guide, primers were designed to several of the expressed sequence tags, and the Gene Trap method was used to screen a human brain cDNA library. Several large (>3-kilobase pair) clones were isolated, but all seemed to be lacking an initiator methionine, because no product could be produced from the cDNAs in an in vitro transcription-translation reaction (data not shown). To complete the cloning of PCLase, a technique termed 5′ RACE was performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The RACE reaction was repeated several times using different 3′ gene-specific primers to ascertain that the true 5′ end was amplified; all products started in the same position. The full PCLase cDNA obtained via ligation of the RACE product into the cDNA obtained from the Gene Trap was 4.2 kilobase pairs in size, in which an open reading frame of 1515 nucleotides was found (Fig. 1). The final cDNA obtained for PCLase contained a relatively short 5′ untranslated region and a large 3′ untranslated region (data not shown). The first methionine residue in this cDNA lies in an optimal Kozak sequence (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar), a motif that is often found just upstream of initiation codons. The deduced protein sequence of PCLase shows no similarity to any known sequence deposited in GenBank. Interestingly, the N-terminal peptide sequence determined for the mature bovine protein began with a glutamic acid (Fig. 1, arrow) and corresponds to residue 29 in the human cDNA coding sequence. This finding suggests the presence of a 28-residue cleavable signal sequence; such a signal peptide was also predicted by analysis of the peptide sequence (data not shown). Sequence analysis also suggested that this enzyme possessed several transmembrane segments. The presence of a signal peptide and putative transmembrane spans provided the first hint that PCLase might reside in an organelle (see below). The tissue distribution of PCLase was examined by Northern blot analysis. RNA blots showed a major transcript with an approximate size of 6 kilobase pairs (Fig. 2). PCLase expression appears to be nearly ubiquitous; message was detected in every tissue tested except spleen, and brain has a low but detectable level of PCLase (other tissues not shown that were tested, included placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, and pancreas). Of the tissues tested, liver consistently showed the highest level of message. In some tissues, a faint band was also observed at 1 kilobase pair, which may be attributable to an alternative splice site within the gene, mRNA breakdown, or possibly a gene related to PCLase. In addition to a predicted signal peptide, several potential N-linked glycosylation sites (residues 196, 323, and 353) were identified in the sequence of PCLase. The presence of the predicted signal peptide suggested that the enzyme would translocate into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it would likely be glycosylated at those accessible sites. As a first test of whether the enzyme was in fact glycosylated, purified bovine enzyme was incubated with two enzymes capable of removing attached sugars, endoglycosidase H and peptideN-glycosidase F. Both glycosidases could indeed digest the native PCLase to faster-migrating species as revealed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A), indicating that PCLase is glycosylated on one or more sites. Digestion with either enzyme resulted in the production of two faster-migrating bands (Fig. 3 A), which could reflect enzyme action on one complex moiety or on two sites with one site more readily digested than the other. To examine whether the product of the cDNA isolated was processed in a similar manner to the native protein, an in vitrotranscription-translation system was used. This was performed in the presence and absence of canine pancreatic microsomes containing the processing machinery to allow full maturation of the newly synthesized protein. The pCMV-Sport/PCLase vector was used in this reaction, and transcription was driven from the SP6 promoter. After translation the samples were split, and half was treated with endoglycosidase H before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Transcription and translation in the absence of added microsomes resulted in formation of a 50-kDa product (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), the mobility of which was unaltered by treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Addition of microsomes to the in vitro reaction resulted in the formation of a 64-kDa species (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) that comigrated with the purified bovine enzyme. Digestion of this product with endoglycosidase H produced a faster-migrating species than the original translation product (Fig. 3 B, lane 5) consistent with the removal of the glycosyl moiety(ies) and cleavage of a signal peptide. Taken together these data indicate that mammalian PCLase is processed by removal of a signal peptide and N-glycosylation to produce the mature protein. As a final confirmation that the cDNA identified encoded PCLase and to produce a system for future structure-function and other studies, expression of recombinant enzyme was undertaken. A recombinant baculovirus carrying the entire open reading frame of human PCLase was constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used to infect Sf9 cells. Immunoblot analysis of Triton X-100 extracts of membrane fractions derived from PCLase-infected Sf9 cells with a PCLase-specific antibody revealed expression of a protein (Fig. 4, lane 2) that comigrated with the purified bovine protein (Fig. 4, lane 3). Mock-infected Sf9 cell membranes did not produce a protein species that comigrates with the purified enzyme (Fig. 4, lane 1). The presence of a doublet in membranes from the PCLase-infected cells may be a result of incomplete glycosylation of the enzyme or possibly degradation of the enzyme during the processing of the samples. The enzymatic activity of PCLase in the membrane fraction derived from infected Sf9 cells was examined. Consistent with the immunoblot data, a dramatic (>100-fold) increase in PCLase activity was observed in membranes from cells expressing recombinant protein compared with those infected with baculovirus not carrying the PCLase gene (Fig. 5); very little endogenous activity was detected in the membrane fraction of mock-infected cells. This negligible background activity will facilitate future structure-function analysis of the enzyme expressed in the Sf9 system. Based on the findings that PCLase was glycosylated and possessed a cleavable signal peptide, the subcellular localization of the protein was undertaken. Identification of a specific subcellular location of the enzyme could give insights into the role of PCLase and how it fits into the overall scheme of the metabolism of prenylcysteines. A two-pronged approach was undertaken in an effort to avoid some of the ambiguity commonly seen in these types of experiments. The first approach involved density gradient separation of subcellular components. Bovine liver was homogenized in a sucrose buffer, and the insoluble fraction was isolated and subjected to separation on a 20% Optiprep gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fractions from the gradient were assayed for the presence of mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and golgi using the specific marker enzymes cytochrome c oxidase, acid phosphatase, catalase, and α-mannosidase II, respectively (Fig. 6). Analysis of fractions from the Optiprep gradient revealed that PCLase activity comigrated with those of the lysosomal marker in this gradient. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that PCLase was present only in those fractions in which activity was detected (data not shown). The second approach used to determine lysosomal localization of PCLase was an immunofluorescence approach that involved examination of colocalization with a known lysosomal resident protein termed LAMP1 (26Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were used in this study, because Northern blot analysis indicated PCLase expression in the kidney (see Fig. 2). Staining of HEK293 with antibodies to both PCLase and LAMP1 was performed. PCLase staining revealed a non-nuclear punctate pattern (Fig. 7 A), which was similar to the staining of LAMP1 in the same cells (Fig. 7 B). The overlay of these two panels (Fig. 7 C) showed that there was considerable overlap between LAMP1 and PCLase, confirming the subcellular fractionation data that PCLase is a lysosomal enzyme. The lysosomal compartment is the primary degradative compartment of the cell and is important in the metabolism of many types of compounds. Lysosomal localization of PCLase would suggest that the enzyme does indeed play a role parallel to that of the aforementioned palmitoyl protein thioesterase, i.e. the disposal of lipid-modified cysteines in the cell. The present study details the cloning, primary structure, expression, and subcellular localization of a human prenylcysteine lyase. The cDNA sequence of the cloned enzyme predicts an open reading frame of 1515 nucleotides encoding a 505-residue polypeptide. Northern blot analysis showed a nearly ubiquitous expression pattern with the highest level found in the liver. Both sequence analysis and experimental data demonstrate the presence of a cleavable signal peptide in PCLase, and experiments using both the native bovine enzyme and recombinant protein revealed that PCLase is a glycosylated enzyme. The presence of a signal peptide and glycosylation sites provided the initial clues that PCLase is organellar in nature, and the results from both subcellular fractionation and immunolocalization studies revealed that the enzyme resides in the lysosome. PCLase is a new and novel enzyme, and sequence analysis programs applied to the data have not indicated identity with any known protein or protein class. A potentially interesting finding is that BLAST analysis of the DNA sequence revealed a region between nucleotides 398 and 1059 of the PCLase cDNA that is identical to a region of noncoding strand in the 5′ untranslated region of the cDNA for an enzyme termed human bile salt-activated lipase (data not shown; Ref.27Baba T. Downs D. Jackson K.W. Tang J. Wang C.-S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 500-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the genes for PCLase and this lipase contain a region arising from a partial gene duplication. Several lines of evidence point to the existence of a signal peptide in PCLase. N-terminal sequencing of the purified bovine protein revealed that the first residue aligns with residue 29 of the predicted protein sequence of human PCLase. We expect the mature human protein to begin at the same position, because it has a proline at −4 with respect to the putative cleavage site and an alanine at the −1 site, which approximately follows the −3, −1 rule (28vonHeijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of PCLase contains several predicted transmembrane segments. The C-terminal 4 amino acid residues of the open reading frame code for a weak endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, KTEL; the optimal sequence for retention is KDEL (29Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1999; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). This suggests PCLase is not an endoplasmic reticulum resident but is transported to another downstream organelle. Indeed, our data point to a lysosomal location for the mature enzyme. The physiological role of PCLase can be hypothesized from the data presented here and in the previous work (15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lysosomal localization for PCLase is completely consistent for a role for this enzyme in the degradation of prenylproteins. The removal of prenylcysteines is probably critical to prevent a disruption of cellular signaling by these compounds (9Philips M.R. Pillinger M.H. Staud R. Volker C. Rosenfeld M.G. Weissmann G. Stock J.B. Science. 1993; 259: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Ding J. Lu D.J. Perez-Sala D. Ma Y.T. Maddox J.F. Gilbert B.A. Badwey J.A. Rando R.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Prenylcysteines produced from degradation of prenyl proteins could conceivably be routed to the lysosome from a variety of intracellular locations. When the prenylcysteines reach the lysosome, they would be digested to free cysteine and an isoprenoid moiety. PCLase does not act on prenylated proteins, because it requires substrates to have a free amino group (15Zhang L. Tschantz W.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23354-23359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because PCLase mRNA expression is highest in the liver, one of the principal organs involved in the detoxification of organic compounds in the body, it is conceivable that PCLase in the liver works in conjunction with P-glycoprotein in other tissues to dispose of prenylcysteines from tissues that have lower levels of PCLase. For example, the brain, which apparently has a low level of PCLase but is very rich in prenyl proteins, may use this method because both the brain and blood-brain barrier are sites that contain high levels of P-glycoprotein (18Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Hence, the prenylcysteines may be pumped out of these cells, enter the bloodstream, be cleared by the liver, and subsequently be degraded by PCLase for either recycling or disposal of the products of the enzyme. The cloning of PCLase will facilitate the study of this enzyme in terms of both its mechanistic properties and its cell biology. It will be particularly interesting to determine whether this protein can be implicated in lysosomal storage disorders such as that observed with mutations of palmitoyl protein thioesterase (14Vesa J.

As the synthesis of HSP47 is closely correlated with that of collagen in various cell lines and tissues, we performed a promoter/reporter assay using HSP47-producing and nonproducing cells. 280 base pairs (bp(s)) of upstream promoter were shown to be necessary for the basal expression but not to be enough for the cell type-specific expression. When the first and the second introns were introduced downstream of this 280-bp region, marked up-regulation of the reporter activity was observed in HSP47-producing cells but not in nonproducing cells. This was confirmed in transgenic mice by staining the lacZ gene product under the control of the 280-bp upstream promoter and the introns. Staining was observed in skin, chondrocytes, precursor of bone, and other HSP47/collagen-producing tissues. A putative Sp1-binding site at −210 bp in the promoter, to which Sp3 and an unidentified protein bind, was shown to be responsible for this up-regulation when combined with the introns. However no difference in the binding to this probe was observed between HSP47-producing and nonproducing cells. The responsible region for cell type-specific up-regulation was found to be located in a 500-bp segment in the first intron. On electrophoresis mobility shift assay using this 500-bp probe, specific DNA-protein complexes were only observed in HSP47-producing cell extracts. These results suggest that two separate elements are necessary for the cell type-specific expression of the hsp47 gene; one is a putative Sp1-binding site at −210 bp necessary for basal expression, and the other is a 500-bp region within the first intron, required for cell type-specific expression.

Generally, most stress proteins are expressed not only under stress conditions but also under normal growth conditions and known to play important roles in protein folding and assembly. They are now generally known as molecular chaperones. The mechanism for heat induction of HSPs is well studied and now known to be transcriptionally regulated by the interaction of heat shock factors with heat shock elements (HSEs), which locate in the promoter region of HSPs (1Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). HSP47 was identified as a collagen-binding 47-kDa glycoprotein (pI = 9.0) (2Nagata K. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7531-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proved to be a heat shock protein (3Nagata K. Saga S. Yamada K.M. J.

Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). HSP47 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as inferred from the presence of a carboxyl-terminal RDEL sequence similar to the ER retrieval signal, KDEL (8Wang S.Y. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15818-15822PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hirayoshi K. Kudo H. Takechi H. Nakai A. Iwamatsu A. Yamada K.M. Nagata K. Mol. Cell.

HSP47 binds to nascent procollagen chains in the ER of collagen-secreted cells and dissociates from them before reaching the cis-Golgi apparatus (4Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 6Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J.

Thus HSP47 functions as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone (15Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The expression of HSP47 is markedly increased by various stresses including heat shock. This heat induction is due to the presence of a well conserved HSE at −80∼−62 bp in the promoter (16Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Hosokawa N. Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. Gene. 1993; 126: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the constitutive expression of HSP47 appears to be co-regulated with that of several types of collagens (15Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (253) Google Scholar). For example, the synthesis of HSP47 and type IV collagen are coordinately increased during the differentiation of murine F9 teratocarcinoma cells (16Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Kudo H. Saga S. Nagata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Wang S.Y. Larosa G.J. Gudas L.J. Dev. Biol. 1985; 107: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the synthesis of both HSP47 and type I collagen are decreased following viral transformation of the fibroblasts. Collagen-nonproducing cells such as mouse myeloid leukemia M1cells and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells do not synthesize HSP47 (19Nagata K. Hirayoshi K. Obara M. Saga S. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8344-8349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nakai A. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 992-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical analysis has revealed that during murine tooth development, HSP47 synthesis coincides with type I collagen production (21Shroff B. Smith T. Norris K. Pileggi R. Sauk J.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1993; 29: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Shroff B. Pileggi R. Norris K. Orbegoso R. Wilson T. Sauk J.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and that HSP47 is localized within developing tissues or cells that secrete various types of collagens (23Miyaishi O. Sakata K. Matsuyama M. Saga S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Pak B.J. Wigle D.A. Watson J.D. Cates G.A. Brickenden A.M. Ball E.H. Pang S.C. Biochem.

Invest. 1994; 94: 2481-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) reported that the synthesis of HSP47 as well as of type I and III collagen increases during the progression of carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis. Marked induction of HSP47 was also reported in the fibrosis of kidney (26Cheng M. Razzaque M.S. Nazneen A Taguchi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Sunamoto M. Kuze T. Iehara H. Takaoka H. Nagata K. Kita T. Doi T. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1998; 79: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the expression of HSP47 under nonstressed conditions is co-regulated with that of collagens in various cell lines and tissues as well as in pathophysiological conditions. In this paper, we analyzed the promoter activity of thehsp47 gene in terms of co-expression with collagen and show that the basal promoter activity of HSP47 exists within a 280-bp promoter region, which was identified as a putative Sp1-binding site, and the introduction of a downstream intron region caused marked up-regulation of its activity only in HSP47/collagen-producing cells but not in nonproducing cells. The mouse genomic DNA library was purchased fromCLONTECH.The recombinant phages carrying mouse DNA fragments were generated by partial digestion with Sau3AI followed by ligation to the EMBL-3 arms. This library was screened using a 1.2-kb fragment containing −1196∼+38 of the mousehsp47 gene (17Hosokawa N. Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. Gene. 1993; 126: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a probe. Hybridization-positive phage clones were amplified, and phage DNA was purified. Long PCR was performed as follows. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the −5.5-kb region and the third exon (−5.5-kb primer, 5′-ATCCATGCAGACAGCAGAGGTG-3′; third exon primer, 5′-CTGGTCTTTGGCCATCGCCT-3′) were used in Long and Accurate PCR (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), with 1 μg of DNA isolated from BALB/c3T3 cells as a template. Whole cell extracts (20 μg for each lane) were electrophoresed on 10, 10, or 4% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-HSP47 (colligin) monoclonal antibody (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., CA), and anti-type I collagen polyclonal antibody (LSL, Japan). The immunoblots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter-antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mouse BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts, human embryonal kidney 293 cells, human epitheloid carcinoma HeLa cells, human osteosarcoma HOS cells, and mouse embryonal carcinoma F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in minimum essential α medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human acute T cell leukemia Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA from thehsp47 gene containing 5.5 kb of upstream promoter and 38 bp of exon I was cloned into a luciferase expression vector, pGL2-basic (Promega), to create pLUC5.5. pLUC2.2, pLUC280, and pLUC13 were generated from pLUC5.5 using the NcoI restriction site at −2.2, SacII site at −280, and SmaI site at −13, respectively. pLUC50 was generated by PCR cloning using the pLUC50 primer (5′-AAGTCGACGGGGGTGGGGCCAGCC-3′). pLUC890 and pLUC210 were generated with a double-stranded nested deletion kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Intron-containing constructs were generated by introducing a SalI restriction site just before the translational start site in the third exon of the hsp47gene to create pLUC5.5(III) and pLUC280(III). pLUC280(III)Sp1m was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 15.51-15.62Google Scholar). Constructs lacking various regions in the introns were generated by using restriction sites as shown in Fig. 9. All plasmids were purified by ultracentrifugation twice and/or a Qiagen Maxi Kit, and it was confirmed that the transfection efficiencies were equal. Cells were plated at a density of 7 × 104/35-mm culture dish 16 h before transfection and transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of the reporter plasmid and 1 μg of pact-β-galactosidase plasmid bearing the chicken β-actin promoter upstream of the lacZ gene (29Maekawa T. Matsuda S. Fujisawa J. Yoshida M. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar) to normalize the differences in transfectional efficiencies. The precipitate was removed after 4 h, and fresh medium was added. At 48 h after the transfection, cells were harvested to perform the luciferase assay. Quantitation of luciferase activities was carried out by Lumat LB9501 (Berthold). β-Galactosidase assay was performed according to Maniatiset al. (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 15.51-15.62Google Scholar). Transfection into Jurkat cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transgenic mice were produced by microinjecting each of the linearized DNA (5.5(III)ZβA, 280(III)ZβA, 280ZβA) into the pronuclei of fertilized eggs from F1 hybrid mice (C57BL/6 ×C3H) as described (30Hogan B.L.M. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 226-244Google Scholar). Founder mice were identified by PCR assays of genomic DNA extracted from the tail. The DNA was subjected to lacZ-specific PCR with a set of primers to amplify an 822-bp product (31Hanley T. Merlie J.P. Biotechniques. 1991; 10: 56PubMed Google Scholar). Positive founder mice were mated with wild-type mice to generate hemizygous embryos, and positive embryos were identified by PCR using placenta DNA. After being rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, mouse embryos were fixed for 6 h at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40. X-gal staining was performed as described (32Bonnerot C. Nicolas J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cell extract (3 μg) in 20 ml of gel shift buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 12% glycerol) was incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and then 32P-end-labeled probes were added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for an additional 20 min with or without nonradiolabeled competitors. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in electrophoresis buffer (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed for 2 h. The sequences of the oligonucleotide probe and competitors are given below: HSP47Sp1 spanning nucleotides −228∼−194, CCCCCTCTACCTAGTAGGGCGAGGGGGCAGTAGGAC; HSP47Sp1m, CCCCTCTACCTAGTAGAATGAGGGGGCAGTAGGAC; consensus Sp1, TGGATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAG. Antibodies against Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. In the case of electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the 500-bp intron, protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 2.5% polyacrylamide gel. We used a 1.2-kb promoter region of the hsp47 gene (17Hosokawa N. Takechi H. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. Gene. 1993; 126: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to screen a mouse genomic library generated by partial digestion withSau3AI (CLONTECH). Four independent positive clones were isolated from 2 ×106 phage, and the restriction map was determined for the clone (Fig. 1). This clone contained a 5.5-kb promoter region and the entire hsp47 gene. Long distance PCR of mouse BALB/c3T3 genomic DNA confirmed that this clone does not contain chimeric inserts (data not shown). We used this clone for subcloning and further analysis. Mouse BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts produce high levels of both type I collagen and HSP47 (6Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S. Hosokawa N. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). On the other hand, human embryonal kidney 293 cells do not produce any type of collagen nor HSP47 (33Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,34Hosokawa N. Satoh M. Kühn K. Nagata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We confirmed this by immunoblot analysis as shown in Fig. 2 A using anti-HSP47 antibody and anti-type I collagen antibody, which can react with both mouse and human HSP47 and type I collagen, respectively (also see Fig. 4 A). DNA sequences from −5.5 kb to +38 bp were fused to the luciferase gene to create a fusion plasmid (pLUC5.5) to determine whether DNA sequences located in the 5′-flanking region of thehsp47 gene are involved in its cell type-specific expression. Several 5′-deletion constructs (pLUC2.2, pLUC890, pLUC280, pLUC50, and pLUC13) were also created as shown in Fig. 2 B. These plasmids were transiently transfected into HSP47/collagen-producing BALB/c3T3 cells or nonproducing 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method, and luciferase assays were performed after 48 h. Luciferase activity in both cells was normalized by the luciferase activity of the pSV40-LUC carrying both the promoter and enhancer of SV40. In both BALB/3T3 and 293 cells, the luciferase activity of pLUC280 containing HSE and putative Sp1-binding sites was higher than that of pLUC50, which contained only a TATA box. The luciferase activity was hardly detected in pLUC13, which did not a contain TATA box. In both BALB/c3T3 and 293 cells, pLUC5.5 did not exhibit any more activity than pLUC280. The luciferase activity of other 5′-deletion constructs (pLUC2.2 and pLUC890) was comparable with that of pLUC5.5 or pLUC280. Thus, the 280-bp promoter was postulated as a minimum promoter. However, no differences between BALB/c3T3 cells and 293 cells were observed in the luciferase activity of pLUC280 or pLUC5.5. These results suggest that 5.5 kb or 280 bp of the upstream region, which confers the basic promoter activity, is not sufficient for the cell type-specific transcriptional activation.FIG. 4Cell type-specific expression of HSP47.

The basis for this loss of accuracy was investigated by measurement of misincorporation fidelity in single turnover conditions. For the four misincorporation reactions investigated, the fidelity of the E249K mutant was not significantly different from wild type, implying that the mutator phenotype was not caused by a general inability to distinguish between correct and incorrect bases during the incorporation reaction. However, the discrimination between correct and incorrect substrates by the E249K enzyme occurred less during the conformational change and chemical steps and more during the initial binding step, compared with pol β wild type. This implies that the E249K mutation alters the kinetic mechanism of nucleotide discrimination without reducing misincorporation fidelity. In a missing base primer extension assay, we observed that the mutant enzyme produced mispairs and extended them. This indicates that the altered fidelity of E249K could be due to loss of discrimination against mispaired primer termini. This was supported by the finding that the E249K enzyme extended a G:A mispair 8-fold more efficiently than wild type and a C:T mispair 4-fold more efficiently. These results demonstrate that an enhanced ability to extend mispairs can produce a mutator phenotype and that the Glu-249 side chain of DNA polymerase β is critical for mispair extension fidelity.

Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), indicating that pol β activity is absolutely required during development, although its specific role is not clear. The best characterized function of pol β is gap-filling synthesis during base excision repair (BER). The BER pathway repairs oxidative and alkylation damage, as well as other DNA lesions. After excision of a damaged base by a DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease (APE) binds to the abasic site and recruits pol β into a complex with the APE and DNA (7Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). APE incises the DNA, and pol β conducts both the gap-filling synthesis and the deoxyribophosphatase steps (1Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 8Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

As AP sites are believed to occur in eukaryotic cells about 10,000 times per cell per day (10Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), this repair pathway is vital for genomic stability. pol β has also been implicated in the process of meiotic recombination. Plug et al. (5Plug A.W. Clairmont C.A. Sapi E. Ashley T. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1327-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) found that pol β dynamically localizes to the synaptonemal complexes formed by chromosome pairs during meiosis. For this reason, pol β is suspected of participating in meiosis. pol β may also have a role in DNA replication. It is required for conversion of single-stranded to double-stranded DNA inXenopus extracts (11Jenkins T.M. Saxena J.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Ackerman E.J. Science. 1992; 258: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and is able to join Okazaki fragments (12Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and participates in the initiation of plasmid replication (13Sweasy J.B. Chen M. Loeb L.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2923-2925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inEscherichia coli. As pol β is not capable of processive synthesis of long stretches of DNA, it may contribute to replication in mammalian cells by specialized, small scale synthesis. pol β is the only known template-directed polymerase without homology to the replicative polymerases. The homology of pol β to the terminal transferase family of non-template-directed polymerases implies that its catalytic activity and template dependence evolved separately (14Matsukage A. Nishikawa K. Ooi T. Seta Y. Yamaguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8960-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Anderson R.S. Lawrence C.B. Wilson S.H. Beattie K.L. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since diverging from the ancestral terminal transferase-type gene, a relatively recent occurrence in evolutionary terms, pol β has acquired the ability to recognize and bind a template and to take orders from this new substrate in order to polymerize in a sequence-specific fashion. pol β therefore straddles two categories, the template-independent nucleotidyltransferases and the template-directed polymerases. As an enzyme with such an unusual evolutionary history, pol β is uniquely situated to shed light on the molecular basis of polymerase substrate specificity. We previously described two AZT-resistant mutants of pol β identified by in vivo selection using the recA718 polA12heterologous complementation system (12Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, pol β substitutes for DNA polymerase I in DNA replication at nonpermissive temperature. The AZT-resistant mutants were selected from a randomly mutagenized library of pol β clones for their ability to grow on AZT in the recA718 polA12 strain at nonpermissive temperature (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The first two AZT-resistant mutants we described, R253M and D246V, carried nonconservative substitutions in the palm domain (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The strong phenotypes exhibited in vivo and in vitro by the R253M and D246V mutants called attention to amino acid residues 240–253 that comprise a loop located within the palm domain of pol β, in which three different AZT resistance mutations were identified. Here we discuss the third of these palm domain loop substitutions, E249K, an active polymerase that exhibits a subtle AZT resistance in combination with a mutator phenotype. The strain BL21 DE3 was used for protein expression and has genotype F− ompT hsdSB(rB−mB−) gal dcm (DE3). The strain FT334, used to detect thymidine kinase mutations in the forward mutation assay, has genotype recA13 upp tdk. WT and mutant proteins were expressed from the pHis-β vector, which expresses pol β as a fusion protein with a six-residue poly-histidine tag at the N terminus. The enzymes were purified as described previously, using Ni2+-charged His-bind resin from Novagen or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin from Qiagen (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For large scale preparations, fast protein liquid chromatography-driven Ni2+ columns were used (Hi-Trap chelating resin, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In this case, the same procedure was followed except that the protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient rather than a single step. The in vitromutation frequencies were obtained using the method of Li et al. (17Li S.-X. Vaccaro J.A. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The template plasmid has a 203-base gap in the HSV-thymidine kinase gene which is filled in by pol β. Mutation frequency was calculated as described by Eckert et al.(18Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ability of each enzyme to incorporate dTTP and AZT-TP into a primer-template was tested in steady-state incorporation reactions using annealed 16- and 45-mer as described previously (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 2.5% glycerol, and 200 nm32P end-labeled primer-template. The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 min, started by the addition of substrate, incubated for the indicated reaction time, and stopped by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were analyzed on a 20% Sequel NE (American Bioanalytical) gel. Bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis to measure 17-mer product formation as a function of time. The DNA substrates employed in the biochemical assays described below are displayed in Fig. 1. The oligonucleotides used in the preparation of the DNA substrates were synthesized at the Yale Department of Pathology facility. The primer oligonucleotides were gel-purified by standard methods (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and were radiolabeled at the 5′ end by standard methods using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The oligonucleotides were annealed at a primer:template molar ratio of 1:1.2 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2. Annealing of primer was confirmed on a 20% acrylamide native gel. Misincorporation and mispair extension were initially examined by the primer extension method described by Suzuki et al (19Suzuki M. Avicola A.K. Hood L. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11228-11235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For each polymerase, five primer extension reactions were performed, using the 45–15-mer oligonucleotides as a primer-template. One reaction included all four dNTPs, 50 μm each, allowing the primer to be fully extended. In each of the other four reactions, one of the four bases was omitted. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C and then quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. The reaction products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed on a PhosphorImager. To elucidate the relative ability of the E249K enzyme compared with β-WT to incorporate correct and incorrect dNTPs into a primer-template, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for dNTP binding,K d , and the maximum rate of polymerization,k pol, for correct and incorrect dNTPs for each enzyme. The kinetics of correct dNTP incorporation were determined under single turnover conditions using rapid chemical quench performed on a KinTek Instruments model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (20Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) thermostatted at 37 °C. Single turnover conditions were determined empirically to be a ratio of enzyme to DNA of 15:1 (data not shown). Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 2.5% glycerol, 50 nm32P-end-labeled primer-template, and 750 nm enzyme. Typically, experiments were carried out by loading 15 μl of the pol β-primer-template complex in buffer in one sample loop and 15 μl of a single dNTP in the second sample loop. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of the two reactant solutions and were quenched at various times with 0.5m EDTA. For correct incorporation reactions, substrate concentrations were typically 0–200 μm, and reaction times were 0–5 s. The kinetics of misincorporation were determined manually under the above single turnover conditions. Reactions were performed by preincubating 750 nm enzyme with 50 nmprimer-template at 37 °C for 1 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate, incubated for the indicated reaction times, and stopped by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA. For incorrect incorporations, substrate concentrations were typically 0–2 mm, and reaction times were 0–1200 s. The reactions resulted in the addition of one dNTP onto the primer. Then (unextended) and n + 1 (extended by one nucleotide) DNA products were resolved on a 20% Sequel NE (American Bioanalytical) polyacrylamide gel. The bands were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis to measure product formation as a function of time. The data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program Sigmaplot version 4.14 (Jandel Scientific). The data from the single turnover experiments were fit with a single exponential equation: [product] =A(1 − exp(−k obs t)), where A is the amplitude and k obs is the observed first order rate constant for dNTP incorporation. To obtain K d , the equilibrium dissociation constant, and k pol, the maximum rate of polymerization, the data were fit with the hyperbolic equation:k obs =k pol[dNTP]/(K d + [dNTP]). Fidelity values were calculated using the following equation: fidelity = ((k pol/K d )correct + (k pol/K d )incorrect)/(k pol/K d )incorrect. These assays were performed as described above, in single turnover conditions, except the primer-template contained mispaired termini. The alteration of Glu-249 to Lys was initially identified by an in vivoselection for AZT-resistant mutants of pol β (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This substitution produced a weak AZT resistance phenotype when expressed in SC18–12 bacteria. pol β E249K appeared to incorporate AZT-TP in vitro about as efficiently as β-WT (Fig. 2), which was unsurprising due to the weakness of the in vivo phenotype. In contrast, the previously identified R253M and D246V mutants exhibited profoundin vivo phenotypes and significantly reduced AZT-TP incorporation in vitro (16Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the accuracy of the AZT-resistant pol β mutant enzymes, the ability of β-WT to misincorporate and extend incorrect bases in a missing base assay was compared with the E249K, R253M, and D246V mutants. In this assay three of the four dNTPs are present. Because copying the template requires that the enzyme misincorporate and extend when the correct base is not present, error-prone enzymes will extend the primer farther than enzymes with high fidelity. Fig. 3 shows that the E249K mutant extended the primer substantially farther than the β-WT enzyme, implying that it is more capable of inserting and extending incorrect bases. Whereas R253M and D246V did extend farther than β-WT in some reactions, these differences were small and not consistently reproducible, unlike E249K. E249K was more effective than β-WT in all four incomplete reactions, but the difference was most pronounced in the A− and C− reactions, representing misincorporation opposite T and G. pol β E249K, unlike β-WT, was able to extend the primer past multiple misinsertion sites, indicating that the mutant enzyme is more willing to extend mispaired termini. The increase in misincorporation and mispair extension suggested that the fidelity of the E249K mutant enzyme is altered. To measure the fidelity of DNA synthesis by the possible mutator enzyme E249K, we employed the HSV-tk forward mutation assay developed by Eckert et al. (18Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this assay, pol β is required to fill a gap 203 bases long in the HSV-tk gene. The resulting pool of plasmid molecules is transformed into E. coli which lack endogenous thymidine kinase activity. Transformants are plated in the presence and absence of the drug 5′-fluoro-2′deoxyuridine, which selects for colonies with an inactive tk gene. As shown in Table I, the mutation frequency for E249K was between 19- and 28-fold increased over that of β-WT. This result indicates that the E249K mutation lowers the fidelity of pol β.Table IThe E249K mutant enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of DNA with lower fidelity than β-wtExperimentFrequency × 10−4-Fold over WTaWT is pol β wild type. The forward mutation assays were performed as described by Li et al. (17).Pol β-WTE249K1133602827.013019a WT is pol β wild type. The forward mutation assays were performed as described by Li et al. (17Li S.-X. Vaccaro J.A. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab To investigate the fidelity of the E249K mutant on a 3′-recessed template, we measured the equilibrium dissociation constants, K d , and the maximum rates of polymerization, k pol, during incorporation of incorrect dNTPs and their corresponding correct dNTPs on the 45–15-mer and 45–14-mer oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 1. In the case of misincorporation reactions, where the time points are relatively long, n + 2 and n + 3 products were often visible, particularly at high substrate concentrations (Fig. 4). This does not interfere with measurement of the first incorporation, as all extension products can be quantified and summed together. However, the mutant did appear to generate qualitatively more of these secondary products. On the 45–15-mer template, after the C:T misincorporation the next two incorporations are T:T and A:T, and mostly the latter product (then + 3 band) accumulates, presumably because the A:T incorporation is comparatively rapid. Because the enzyme is present in large excess over DNA (15:1 molar ratio), and the products appear only in later time points when most of the primer has been extended, then + 2 and n + 3 products are most likely the result of multiple binding events to the same primer-template molecule. Surprisingly, no significant difference between WT and mutant enzymes was apparent in the C:T misincorporation reaction. Time courses of product formation of dTTP insertion opposite template C with different concentrations of substrate are shown in Fig. 5 A. The observed rates of product formation (k obs) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and were plotted against the various concentrations of dTTP used in these experiments, as shown in Fig. 5 B. The K d andk pol values for misincorporation of T opposite C and A opposite G on a recessed primer-template were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are shown in Table II. The E249K enzyme discriminates as effectively as β-WT against incorporation of dTTP opposite C, having a fidelity of 1 × 105, which is 4-fold greater than that of β-WT. For misincorporation opposite C, β-WT has a discrimination factor of 8500 (68/0.008) between the correct and incorrect substrates at the level of k pol, and only a 2-fold (317/132) discrimination factor in K d . This indicates that β-WT discriminates correct from incorrect dNTP substrate mostly at the level of k pol. The E249K mutant discriminates correct from incorrect substrate by a factor of 6700 at the k pol level, which is similar to β-WT. However, the discrimination factor of E249K for correctversus incorrect at the initial binding step is 14, which is 7-fold greater than observed for β-WT.Table IIKinetics of misincorporation by β-WT and E249K on recessed and gapped primer-templatesEnzymeTemplateaRecessed primer-template as in Fig. 1; for incorporation opposite template C the 45–15-mer was used; for incorporation opposite G the 45–14-mer was used.

Open table in a new tab The results of the G:A fidelity experiments, using the 45–14-mer 3′-recessed template (Table II), were similarly surprising. In this case, the E249K mutant did exhibit a 3.7-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of misincorporation. However, the misincorporation fidelity of the E249K enzyme was not significantly different from β-WT, because the efficiency of correct G:C incorporation also increased slightly. The discrimination factors at the level ofk pol for β-WT and E249K are 1500 and 500, respectively, and for K d are 10 and 22, respectively. The E249K mutant discriminates against misincorporation of dATP opposite G less at the level of k polthan β-WT but more at the level of K d . This results in E249K having a similar fidelity to that of β-WT but suggests that discrimination of correct from incorrect dNTP occurs by a different kinetic mechanism than that of β-wt. Next, we compared the fidelity of E249K to that of β-WT on a single base gap with a 5′-phosphate group because this DNA substrate is the preferred template of pol β (2Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic constants obtained from analyzing the misincorporation of T opposite C and G opposite T on a 1-base pair gapped DNA substrate are shown in Table II. The k pol and K d for T:G misincorporation were similar for the mutant enzyme compared with β-WT, as were the catalytic efficiencies and fidelities. Discrimination against the incorporation of dTTP opposite C by the β-WT enzyme seems to occur predominantly at thek pol level, where the correct nucleotide is favored by 2700-fold, as shown in Table II. Ground-state nucleotide binding contributes only 19-fold discrimination. The E249K mutant discriminates against misincorporation of dTTP opposite C almost as effectively as β-wt, but does so less than β-WT at thek pol stage (390-fold) and more at the binding stage (70-fold). This implies that the E249K mutation alters the kinetic mechanism of nucleotide discrimination without reducing misincorporation fidelity. The apparent willingness of the E249K enzyme to perform successive misincorporations in both the missing base and the primer extension assays led us to examine the mispair extension fidelity of β-WT and E249K. We measured the ability of β-WT and E249K to incorporate a correct nucleotide (C:G) following a G:A or T:C mispair. The mispair extension reaction was slow for both enzymes, as shown in Table III. The E249K mutant did extend both mismatches more efficiently than β-WT. The difference was more pronounced with the purine:purine mismatch, for which the E249K mutant catalytic efficiency was increased by more than 8-fold, compared with 4-fold for the pyrimidine:pyrimidine mispair. Suprisingly, the increased efficiency of the E249K enzyme appeared to be governed by different kinetic parameters for the two mispairs. The mutant enzyme'sk pol for incorporation of C:G following the G:A mismatch was increased 1.8-fold, and K d (dGTP) was decreased 4.5-fold, compared with β-WT. The difference in C:T mispair extension was due to a higher k pol (4-fold) of the mutant enzyme.Table IIIKinetics of extension of mismatched primer-template termini by β-WT and E249KEnzymeTerminal mispairaTo measure extension of a mispair, the rate of incorporation of the next correct nucleotide following the mispair was measured.

Open table in a new tab The E249K mutant enzyme demonstrated a loss of accuracy in the missing base primer extension assay and in the HSV-tk forward mutation assay. This phenotype often indicates an inability to discriminate against incorrect nucleotides during incorporation. However, using two 3′-recessed and two gapped primer-templates, the E249K mutant failed to demonstrate a reduced misincorporation fidelity to account for its apparent mutator phenotype. These results lead to the conclusion that the mutator phenotype of this mutant is not caused by a global loss of misincorporation fidelity. Without testing all possible mispairs, it is impossible to say whether the mutant enzyme has lower fidelity for some mispairs, but the lack of compromised fidelity for C:T, T:G, and G:A mispairs is difficult to reconcile with the evidence that this mutant is in fact error-prone. During all four correct incorporation reactions, the mutant was at least as efficient as β-WT, as measured byk pol/K d . This separates E249K from other known pol β mutator mut"

Virtually all cells secrete specific proteins that function in a variety of cellular processes, including cell-substrate interactions and intercellular signaling. In certain cell types protein secretion is constitutive, as in the case of pancreatic beta cells where secretion of insulin is the main cellular event, and the mechanics of the process are now quite well understood (1Lang J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In other cell types, such as neurons, protein secretion is regulated in a spatial and temporal pattern (2De Camilli P. Jahn R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 625-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Certainly protein secretion also plays important roles in specific events in multicellular development, although this has received much less attention. This is primarily due to the difficulty in identifying and characterizing these processes within the tissues of complex embryos. A dramatic case of developmentally regulated secretion occurs at the terminal stage of spore cell differentiation in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (3Alexander S. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo1997: 349-362Google Scholar), and the relative simplicity of morphogenesis in this organism allows for the in depth analysis of the mechanisms that underlie this cellular event. As long as there is a source of food, Dictyostelium amoebae remain as single cells and divide by mitosis. When the food source is exhausted or removed, the cells form multicellular aggregates of approximately 105 cells. These multicellular aggregates then undergo a program of cytodifferentiation and morphogenesis to produce an intermediate slug and ultimately a mature fruiting body with a cellular stalk that supports about 80,000 mature spores. Proper cell differentiation results in environmentally resistant spores that are an evolutionary advantage to the organism, as they allow cells to remain viable for extended periods of time. A complex and well studied program of gene expression underlies the process of cell differentiation (4Alexander S. Rossomando E.F. Rossomando E.F. Alexander S. Morphogenesis: An Analysis of the Development of Biological Form. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 29-61Google Scholar,5Loomis W.F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 684-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The slug stage of development shows a clear spatial distribution of cells. The cells that are destined to differentiate into spores are called prespore cells and comprise the rear 80% of the multicellular slug. The prestalk cells, destined to become stalk cells, reside in the anterior end of the slug. Prespore cells in the slug are characterized by the presence of specialized, cell type-specific secretory vesicles, called the prespore vesicles (PSVs) 1The abbreviations used are: PSV, prespore vesicle; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GPS, galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-containing polysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; RCA-I, Ricinus communis agglutinin I; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

The PSVs contain components that are essential for the formation of the future spore coat. Several structural spore coat proteins have been identified and studied, such as SP96, PsB (SP85), SP75, SP70, and SP60 (9Devine K.M. Morrissey J.H. Loomis W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon secretion from the PSVs, the PsB complex and other unassembled spore coat proteins are incorporated into a rigid, trilaminar spore coat by an unknown mechanism. The spore coat is composed of approximately 50% cellulose and 50% glycoprotein (21West C.M. Erdos G.W. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 492-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the cellulose binding property of the PsB complex is required for the maintenance of the structural integrity of the spore coat and viability of the spore (19McGuire V.

O-Glycosylation and Spore Maturation in Dictyostelium discoideum. Ph.D. thesis. Macquarie University, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia1996Google Scholar). The pivotal event for spore cell differentiation is the developmentally regulated fusion of the PSVs with the plasma membrane and the subsequent release of their contents into the extracellular matrix. When development is arrested at the migratory slug stage, the PSVs accumulate spore coat proteins, but they do not fuse with the plasma membrane. 2S. Srinivasan, H. Alexander, and S. Alexander, unpublished data. Hence the regulated secretion of the PSV contents is a true signal-mediated event that underlies cell-type differentiation of prespore cells to spores. Many significant questions remain unanswered about the genesis of the spore coat and the role of PSVs in this process. 1) Do the PSVs undergo changes in protein content and/or morphology as development proceeds? 2) What is the nature of the developmental signal that initiates the synchronous events resulting in exocytosis? 3) What are the molecular mechanisms by which the PSVs move to, and fuse with, the plasma membrane? 4) What are the membrane proteins that must be involved in these processes? In addition, we know nothing of the content of the PSVs beyond the most abundant structural spore coat proteins. It is reasonable to assume that other proteins reside in the lumen of these vesicles and that they may have catalytic roles in the assembly of the spore coat. The most direct approach to these biochemical questions is to develop a procedure that results in a high level of purification of the vesicles. PSVs can then be isolated and characterized at different stages of morphogenesis. Moreover, the purified material can be effectively analyzed in the proteome project that is under way forDictyostelium (23Yan J.X. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Maeda Y. Inouye K. Takeuchi I. Dictyostelium: A Model System for Cell and Developmental Biology. Universal Academy Press, Inc., Tokyo1997: 455-469Google Scholar). The unique ability to produce large quantities of synchronously developing Dictyostelium cells has made it possible to undertake this analysis. Previous reports have presented approaches to the purification of PSVs but, the reports did not include the requisite analyses using the appropriate organelle-specific markers to establish the purity of the preparations (24Ikeda T. Takeuchi I. Dev. Growth Differ. 1971; 13: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Lenhard J.M. Kasperek E. Moore B.R. Free S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 182: 242-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 27Lenhard J.M. Siegel A. Free S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 2761-2769Google Scholar), and we found that these methods did not result in an adequate level of purification needed to address the questions outlined above. In this report we demonstrate the purification of the PSVs from four different developmental stages of D. discoideum. Using the now abundant assays available to us, including electron microscopy, we establish the purity of the PSV preparations and the absence of contaminating organelles. We demonstrate that newly synthesized spore coat proteins continue to accumulate specifically in the PSVs until the cells receive the signal to begin the processes that ultimately lead to fusion and exocytosis and that this signal is temporally associated with the slug to fruit transition. During development the PSVs undergo maturation, including changes in structure. A 21-kDa GTP-binding protein becomes specifically associated with the membrane fraction from the PSVs and is a good candidate for a regulatory protein that coordinates the rate of PSV/plasma membrane fusion (28Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1212-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, it is clear that the protein content of the PSVs is complex, containing many more proteins than just the structural spore coat proteins. Proteome analysis of both the membrane and lumenal proteins will allow us to identify many of these proteins and determine their functions in this highly regulated developmental process. Wild-type WS380B was grown in association with Klebsiella aerogenes on SM agar plates at 22 °C (29Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested when they reached mid-log phase (2–4 × 108 cells/100-mm plate). Residual bacteria were washed away by differential centrifugation in LPS buffer (20 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 g/liter streptomycin sulfate, 40 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5), and the cells were resuspended in the same buffer. To obtain slugs, 5 × 108 washed cells were plated on 100-mm plates containing 1.5% agar in distilled water. LPS agar was used to obtain preculminants (30Newell P. Ellington J. Sussman M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 177: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Development is synchronous, and the slug stage is reached at 10 h in this rapidly developing wild type strain (31Alexander S. Smith E. Davis L. Gooley A. Por S.B. Browne L. Williams K.L. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Slugs were harvested into cold LPS and pelleted. The pellet of slugs was resuspended in 3 volumes of disaggregation medium (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, 0.1% Pronase) (32Takeuchi I. Yabuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1970; 61: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The suspension was then swirled occasionally at room temperature for 10 min to allow complete disaggregation of the slugs. The disaggregated cells were washed twice with LPS, and the cells were then kept at 4 °C for the remaining procedures. A summary of the steps involved in PSV purification is shown in Fig. 1. Disaggregated prespore cells were resuspended in 3 volumes of homogenizing medium (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. A mixture of protease inhibitors was added from a 100 × stock (pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml; leupeptin, 10 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm). The cells were then broken with 30 strokes of a tight-fitting Wheaton Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was spun at 700 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei and unbroken cells. The 700 × gsupernatant was set aside while the pellet was resuspended in 3 volumes of homogenizing medium. The suspension was homogenized again, followed by centrifugation at 700 × g. This step was repeated in order to increase the yield of PSVs, because we found that the first homogenization step left 30% of the cells unbroken. The 700 ×g supernatants were pooled and spun at 4000 ×g for 20 min. The 4000 × g pellet containing the PSVs was resuspended in homogenizing medium, placed on top of a 25% Percoll gradient (Sigma), and spun at 25,000 ×g for 1 h using a type 80 Ti rotor in a Beckman LE-80K ultracentrifuge. 1-ml fractions from the Percoll gradient were resuspended to 12 ml in homogenizing medium and spun at 100,000 ×g for 1 h in an SW 41 Ti rotor with no brake deceleration. For biochemical experiments, the vesicle pellets were recovered and resuspended to 200 μl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1% Triton X-100, and the protease inhibitors. All samples were stored at −20 °C. Protein quantitation was performed by the colorimetric BCA assay (Pierce), using BSA as a standard. Protein gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 34Khyse-Andersen J.

The GTP binding assay was adapted from Vater et al. (44Vater C.A. Reynolds C.K. Ekena K. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Equal protein samples (10–20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE with 4 m urea and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated for 15 min in 100 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 and blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature. The blots were incubated for 30 min in 50 ml of hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3% BSA, 0.5% Tween 20, 120 μg/ml tRNA) containing 100 mCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 mCi/mmol, ICN Biochemicals) and washed three times for 20 min in blocking buffer. The blots were then air-dried and autoradiographed. Vesicle preparations removed from the Percoll gradient were fixed in homogenizing medium containing 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, then spun at 100,000 × gfor 1 h to pellet the vesicles. The vesicle pellet was washed three times in homogenizing medium, then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min. The samples were embedded in 2% agar before serial dehydrations in ethanol, followed by infiltration and final embedment in Spurr's resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). DisaggregatedD. discoideum cells from different developmental stages were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and 2% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. Fixed cells were dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's resin. For immunolabeling, samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde alone, and embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Thin sections were blocked in 1% BSA for 30 min and stained with MUD102 for 1 h. Serial washes in sterile water were followed by incubation with 2 nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. RCA-I labeling was performed as described previously (10Erdos G.W. West C.M. Exp. Mycol. 1989; 13: 169-182Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 20 nm gold-conjugated RCA-I (EY Laboratories) was used at a dilution of 1:250. All thin sections were stained with 4% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol (18 min) and Reynold's lead citrate (12 min) and viewed in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Early attempts at purification of the prespore vesicles did not include the appropriate assays necessary to establish the purity of the PSVs (24Ikeda T. Takeuchi I. Dev. Growth Differ. 1971; 13: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Ikeda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Lenhard J.M. Kasperek E.

In numerous attempts to repeat these protocols, we found that the PSVs were not fractionated as a discrete peak on the gradients used and that all the fractions containing PSVs also contained a complex mixture of markers for other organelles (data not shown). Therefore, using the biochemical markers and the corresponding antibodies for the definition of specific organelles, which are now well characterized inDictyostelium, we have developed a protocol to yield a highly enriched PSV fraction that is devoid of markers for other organelles. Our initial aim was to test whether the nuclei, PSVs, and lysosomes were separable by low speed centrifugation. In a typical experiment, we grew 1010 cells of wild-type WS380B, which were allowed to undergo development to yield 105 slugs. The slugs were disaggregated into a suspension of greater than 95% single cells. No effort was made to separate the prespore cells (approximately 80% of the total) from the prestalk cells because of the low yields from the generally used method for separating the two cell types (45Ratner D. Borth W. Exp. Cell Res. 1983; 143: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The disaggregated cells were homogenized in an isotonic buffer to shear the plasma membrane while leaving the intracellular organelles intact. The homogenate was then divided into aliquots and subjected to centrifugations ranging from 200 × g to 1400 ×g. In order to assay for nuclei, genomic DNA was extracted from equal cell equivalents of the supernatants and visualized on an agarose gel. As shown in Fig. 2 A (lane 4), the nuclei, as assessed by the presence of genomic DNA, sediment by 700 × g. The post-nuclear supernatant from the 700 × g spin was subjected to a subsequent series of centrifugations ranging from 1600 to 18,000 × g. Each of the pellets and supernatants was analyzed for the presence or absence of PSVs, using the PsB protein as a marker, and lysosomes, using α-mannosidase as a marker. Centrifugation at 4000 × g removed at least 90% of the PsB protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). 50% of the α-mannosidase was removed by centrifugation at 4000 ×g (Fig. 2 C). Centrifugation at forces up to 18,000 × g removed only an additional 20% of the enzyme activity. These data indicate that the PSVs and lysosomes are at least partially separable by this step. Earlier work has shown that a force of 12,000 × g is required for mitochondria to sediment (46Sussman R.R. Rayner E.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 144: 127-137Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We chose Percoll gradient centrifugation for further purification due to its successful use in the fractionation of post-Golgi vesicles in other organisms (47Gracz L.M. Parsons S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1292: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The 25% Percoll gradient fractionation of the 4000 × g pellet consistently produced three bands at different densities: band 1 at 1.07 g/ml, band 2 at 1.10 g/ml, and band 3 at 1.12 g/ml. (Note: we show later that the density of band 3 changes with developmental stage.) Each band was tested for the enrichment of PSV markers, and the absence of markers from other organelles, as is shown in Fig. 3. The spore coat proteins PsB, SP96, and SP75 were used as markers for PSVs (8Devine K.M. Bergmann J.E. Loomis W.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Watson N.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2567-2579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and detected by Western blots. Additionally, ELISAs were done using the anti-PsB antibody to obtain a quantitative measurement of the specific enrichment of PsB during different stages of the purification procedure. The PSVs were found almost exclusively in the most dense band (band 3). Table I presents a quantitative enrichment of the PSV marker protein PsB at different stages of the purification procedure and shows that the PSVs were enriched approximately 80-fold over the starting cell homogenate, with an overall yield of the PsB protein marker of 60%. This, coupled with an overall protein recovery of 0.7% in band 3 shows that the PSVs represent approximately 1% of the total cellular protein in prespore cells at this stage of development. Further purification of band 3 from the Percoll gradient using either continuous sucrose gradients or S-1000 gel filtration did not appreciably increase the degree of enrichment.Table IPurification of prespore vesicles as measured by enrichment of the PsB proteinPurification stageUnits/ml (×103)aUnits are measured as the reciprocal of the antibody dilution at the endpoint of the titration curve.Protein concentrationTotal proteinSpecific activity (×106)bSpecific activity is defined as units/mg protein.Fold purification of PsB proteinRecovery of PsB proteinmg/mlmg%Homogenate3.1332.071731.7897.21.0100700 × gsupernatant3.1318.99852.30164.01.783.34000 × gpellet25.025.3465.88986.510.138.6Percoll band 3: PSVs20023.4211.78540.087.959.4a Units are measured as the reciprocal of the antibody dilution at the endpoint of the titration curve.b Specific activity is defined as units/mg protein.

Differentiation. 1992; 51: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 53Erdos G. Mycologia. 1985; 77: 308-315Crossref Google Scholar). In each case, the Percoll gradient fraction containing PSVs did not contain markers for any other organelle (Fig. 3). These results have been consistently obtained in multiple purifications. The levels of all enzymes tested in homogenates were consistent with previous published reports (40Loomis W.F. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 103: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Loomis W.F. J.

Based on these data, we concluded that band 3 from the Percoll gradients contained a highly enriched PSV population. The purity of the PSV preparations was examined by electron microscopy. Thin sections of the purified PSVs show that the vesicle preparation appears quite homogeneous, and the vesicles have diameters of approximately 200–250 nm (Fig. 4 A). As described previously in intact cells (6Hohl H. Hamamoto S. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1969; 26: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the PSVs contain an electron-dense region that is surrounded by a electron-lucent gap and enclosed by a typical membrane bilayer (Fig. 4 A). It is clear that the PSVs are discrete vesicles and not a tubular network as suggested previously (21West C.M. Erdos G.W."
https://openalex.org/W2138195153,"We cloned human and murine cDNAs of a gene (designated PHR1), expressed preferentially in retina and brain. In both species, PHR1 utilizes two promoters and alternative splicing to produce four PHR1 transcripts, encoding isoforms of 243, 224, 208, and 189 amino acids, each with a pleckstrin homology domain at their N terminus and a transmembrane domain at their C terminus. Transcript 1 originates from a 5′-photoreceptor-specific promoter with at least three Crx elements ((C/T)TAATCC). Transcript 2 originates from the same promoter but lacks exon 7, which encodes 35 amino acids immediately C-terminal to the pleckstrin homology domain. Transcripts 3 and 4 originate from an internal promoter in intron 2 and either include or lack exon 7, respectively. In situ hybridization shows thatPHR1 is highly expressed in photoreceptors, with lower expression in retinal ganglion cells. Immunohistochemistry localizes the PHR1 protein to photoreceptor outer segments where chemical extraction studies confirm it is an integral membrane protein. Using a series of PHR1 glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins to perform in vitro binding assays, we found PHR1 binds transducin βγ subunits but not inositol phosphates.

This elegant system depends on the coordinated expression of a large set of genes and on the interaction of their protein products. Many components of this system are expressed only in photoreceptors, and several are associated with retinal degeneration when defective.

Accordingly, we reasoned that genes expressed preferentially or exclusively in retina would be important for the normal retinal structure and function, and would be likely candidates for retinal degenerations. To identify genes with these expression characteristics, we implemented a differential hybridization screen (9Bascom R.A. Schappert K. McInnes R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,21Swanson D.A. Freund C.L. Steel J.M. Xu S. Ploder L. McInnes R.R. Valle D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One of the clones identified in this screen, designatedPHR1 (for pleckstrin homology domainretinal protein) was of interest because it showed preferential expression in retina and brain. We subsequently cloned and sequenced human and murine full-length PHR1 cDNAs and found that they encode proteins with an N-terminal PH domain and a hydrophobic, putative transmembrane domain at the C terminus. PHR1 is the first PH domain-containing protein found to be preferentially and abundantly expressed in retina and, insofar as we know, the first to be identified as an integral membrane protein. During the preparation of this report, a report describing cloning of cDNAs encoding two of the four PHR1 transcripts (designated evectin-1) appeared (see “Discussion”) (22Krappa R. Nguyen A. Burrola P. Deretic D. Lemke G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4633-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PH domains were first recognized in pleckstrin, a platelet structural protein phosphorylated by PKC (23Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shorr R.G. Haslam R.J. Harley C.B.

Since then, more than 100 PH domain-containing proteins have been identified, including serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases (e.g. Btk, Akt, βArk), phospholipases (phospholipase C), regulators of small G proteins (e.g. Ras-GAP, SOS, Ras-GRF), adaptors (3BP2), endocytic GTPases (e.g. dynamin), and some cytoskeletal molecules (e.g. spectrin, pleckstrin) (26Musacchio A.

Transducin, an abundant photoreceptor G protein, plays a key role in the mammalian phototransduction cascade; a phosphoinositide pathway is utilized for phototransduction inDrosophila; and components of this system persist in mammalian photoreceptors (43Peng Y.W. Rhee S.G. Yu W.P. Ho Y.K. Schoen T. Chader G.J. Yau K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1995-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we characterize the human and murine PHR1 genes and their protein products with emphasis on a PHR1 polypeptide that is an integral membrane protein in the photoreceptor outer segment. We performed a differential hybridization screen on a human retinal cDNA library as described (21Swanson D.A. Freund C.L. Steel J.M. Xu S. Ploder L. McInnes R.R. Valle D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To isolate the murine ortholog ofPHR1, we screened a murine whole eye cDNA library (kindly provided by Jeremy Nathans) using a human PHR1 cDNA as probe. To isolate the corresponding structural gene, we screened a human leukocyte genomic library (kindly provided by Se-Jin Lee) and a 129SVJ murine genomic library (Stratagene). For RT-PCR we used a cDNA Cycle kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with modification of the PCR conditions to accommodate gene-specific primers. We isolated RNA with RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc) according to the manufacturer's directions. For some experiments, we purchased RNA from Invitrogen. To extend the 5′ ends of the human and murine PHR1, we utilized the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's-specifications. The gene-specific primers for amplification of the murine cDNA were: m-r-7: AGGACTTTCCAGGATGGAGT (exon 3); m-r-6, GACATTGAAGTGGATGACTAC (exon 4); m-r-11, GTCTCAGGCGTGTCCACGT (exon 5); and m-r-4, CTCAGAACCAACAAGGCGAC (exon 9). The primers for human PHR1 were: 39R7, CTGTCTCATCGTGGTAGTATC (exon 4); 39R6, GCATCATCCTTGGTCTCCG (exon 5); and 39R0–4, CGCTGTAGCAGGGATCCTC (exon 9). We TA cloned (Invitrogen) and sequenced the products. To map humanPHR1, we developed a STS in the 3′-UTR in PHR1 gene and used GeneBridge4 radiation hybrid panel (Research Genetics, Inc.). The forward primer was 5′-GAGTTCTATTTGAGACTTCCAG-3′; the reverse primer was 5′-CTATTGGTGATTGGGATAGAA-3′. For PCR amplification, we denatured at 95 °C × 5 min and then performed 30 cycles of 62 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 2 min, 95 °C, 30 s. We submitted the results to the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research/MIT Center for Genome Research to obtain a chromosomal localization. To map murine PHR1, we used Jackson Lab Backcross DNA mapping panels, BSB, and BSS. We developed a MspI polymorphic marker in intron 8 of mouse PHR1 gene and amplified the relevant region with primers m-F-12/m-R-4 (m-F-12, 5′-GTATCAGGACTACTATGAGGT-3′; M-R-4, 5′-GAAGCTAACATCTCAGGCAC-3′), which yield a 722-bp product derived from genomic DNA of both Mus spretus and C57BL6J. MspI digestion cuts the product derived from C57BL6J but not M. spretus into fragments of 238 and 484 bp. We submitted the results to the Jackson Laboratory data base to obtain the chromosomal localization. We used the DIG RNA labeling system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to synthesize human and mouse PHR1 RNA probes according to the manufacturer's instructions. For in situ hybridization, we utilized the protocol of Schaeren-Wiemerset al. (44Schaeren-Wiemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Briefly, we fixed sections of retina or pineal body in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min at room temperature, then washed them in PBS three times and acetylated them in acetylation buffer (4 ml of triethanolamine (Fluka), 0.525 ml of HCl, 0.75 ml of acetic anhydride, 295 ml of H2O) at room temperature for 10 min. Following three washes in PBS, we prehybridized the acetylated sections by incubation in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (Sigma), 250 μg/ml MRE600 tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 500 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega) at room temperature for 6 h in a 5× SSC humidified chamber. We then desiccated the prehybridization solution and incubated the sections in hybridization solution containing 200–400 ng/ml DIG RNA probe that had been preheated to 80 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice. We covered the section with coverslips and incubated them in a humidified chamber containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide at 72 °C overnight. On the following day, we washed the sections with 0.2× SSC at 72 °C for 30 min twice; 0.2× SSC, room temperature for 30 min once; and B1 solution (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) room temperature for 5 min once. We then incubated the sections in B1 solution with 5% heat-inactivated goat serum, 0.2% Tween 20 (B2) at room temperature for 1 h and then added anti-DIG antibody (1/5000 dilution in B1 with 1% heat-inactivated goat serum) to each slide. The slides were then kept in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight. We rinsed the sections with B1 solution for 5 min three times and equilibrated them in B3 solution (0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2). We added B4 solution (0.4 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.19 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, 50 mm MgSO4, with 0.24 mg/ml levamisole; Promega) to the sections and incubated them at room temperature for 6 h to 3 days in a humidified chamber in the dark. We stopped the reaction by washing in TE, pH 8.0, followed by a water rinse and mounted the sections. To make fusion protein constructs, we amplified full-length or segments of human PHR1 cDNA and cloned the products in pMAL-C2 (New England Biolab) or pGST/His-T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We confirmed all constructs by sequence analysis. We made two MBP fusion constructs: Hsf.l.L/MBP (long form PHR1 aa 1–243) and HsPH.only/MBP (aa 1–137). Additionally, we made five GST fusion constructs (Fig. 3 D): Hsf.l.L/GST (long form PHR1 (isoform 1) aa 1–243); HSf.l.S (short form PHR1 (isoform 2) aa 1–208); HsPH.L+C30/GST (PHR1 isoform 1 aa 1–164); HsPH.S+C30/GST (PHR1 isoform 2 aa 1–157); and HsPH.only/GST (PHR1 isoform 1 aa 1–137). The BtkPH+C30/GST (Btk: aa 1–165) was kindly provided by Stephen Desiderio. We transfected all constructs into DH5α cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) and induced and purified the fusion protein following the manufacturer's instructions. To develop polyclonal anti-PHR1 antibodies, we immunized New Zealand White rabbits with MBP fusion proteins (Hsf.l.L/MBP and HsPH.only/MBP) and used the GST fusion proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose or cross-linked to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) for affinity purification as described (45Smith D.E. Fisher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We purified photoreceptor OS and transducin from 50 bovine retinas (Schenk Packing Co. Inc.) as described (46Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 47Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used washed ROS membrane (50 μg) for both cholate and Na2CO3 extraction assays. For the Na2CO3 extraction assay, we followed the procedure exactly as described by Crane et al. (48Crane D.I. Kalish J.E. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21835-21844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, following extractions with 0.1 mNa2CO3 we centrifuged the membranes at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended the pellet in the same volume as the supernatant. We loaded equivalent amounts of the pellet fraction and the supernatant fraction on 10–12% SDS-PAGE gel, and, following electrophresis, transferred the protein to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We then incubated the blot in 1:1000 diluted purified anti-PHR1 polyclonal antibody as primary antibody followed by 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) for ECL detection. As a control, we used rhodopsin as a representative integral membrane protein and Gβ as a representative membrane-associated protein. We obtained anti-Gβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-rhodopsin from Jeremy Nathans. For the cholate extraction assay, we followed the method of Watson et al. (49Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) using 1% cholate (Sigma) and treated the extracted membranes as in the Na2CO3 assay. We homogenized murine retina or brain and bovine retina in homogenization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with a Teflon/glass homogenizer, and sonicated the homogenate for 1 min. We used the BCA assay (Pierce) to quantitate protein content. We hydrated cryostat sections in PBS for 15 min, blocked with 10% goat serum (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min, and permeabilized the sections with 1% Triton X-100 plus 10% goat serum in PBS for 10 min. We incubated the sections in primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by washing with PBS for 10 min three times and incubation with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After washing the sections with PBS for 10 min three times and rinsing in double-distilled H2O, we mounted coverslips with Immunofloor (ICN) and viewed the sections with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 410 invert. We incubated ∼5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 5 μg of transducin extract in a total volume of 50 μl at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle mixing. We collected the pellet by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, washed with 600 μl of 1× PBS/0.01% Lubrol five times to resuspend the final pellet in 2× SDS sample buffer (50Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman G.J. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar) and resolved the proteins by 10% SDS-PAGE. We electroblotted the proteins to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and probed the blots with anti-Gβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) as secondary antibody using ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We purchased the indicated 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (I-IP, 1,4-IP2, 1,4,5-IP3, 1,3,4,5-IP4) from NEN Life Science Products. For the binding reaction we added 1 μl of each inositol phosphate to 5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B in a final volume of 30 μl of PBS. Following incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, we centrifuged the reactions at 500 × g, 4 °C for 5 min and washed the pellet with 300 μl of PBS three times. We suspended the final pellet in 400 μl of Solvable (Packard), added 10 ml of Aquassure (Packard) and glacial acetic acid (400 μl) to suppress chemiluminescence, and quantified the radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectrometry. We identified PHR1 in a differential hybridization screen of an arrayed retinal cDNA library designed to identify cDNAs expressed preferentially or exclusively in retina (9Bascom R.A. Schappert K. McInnes R.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Swanson D.A. Freund C.L. Steel J.M. Xu S. Ploder L. McInnes R.R. Valle D. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend our initial result, we examined the expression ofPHR1 on Northern blots of RNA from multiple human tissues (Fig. 1 A). We found an ∼2.0-kb PHR1 transcript(s) highly expressed in retina and brain, with much lower expression in several other tissues and no detectable expression in lymphoblasts or fibroblasts. With β-actin as normalization control, expression of PHR1 in human retina is ∼4.5-fold higher than in brain and 100–170-fold higher than in testis and kidney. In contrast to what appeared to be a single PHR1 transcript in human tissues (Fig. 1 A), in mouse (Fig. 1 B), there appeared to be two PHR1 transcripts: a predominant 2.1-kb mRNA, expressed only in retina; and a 1.8-kb mRNA, expressed at lower level in retina and as the only detectable transcript in brain and other tissues (e.g. liver and lung; data not shown). To determine if the retinal expression of murine Phr1 showed diurnal variation, we isolated total retinal RNA at 3 p.m. (light-adapted) and 3 a.m. (dark-adapted) in animals on a 12-h light/dark cycle transitioning at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Using β-actin as a normalization control, we found the ratio of the 2.1-kb transcript in dark-adapted to light-adapted retina is ∼1.8:1, while that of the 1.8-kb transcript is ∼1:1. Thus, the expression of the 2.1-kb transcript increased modestly (∼2-fold) in the dark. We found no periodic alteration of PHR1 mRNA levels in brain. We subsequently cloned and sequenced full-length human and murine PHR1 cDNAs. The human cDNA (U89715) is 2004 bp, and the murine cDNA (AF000272) is 2068 bp. Both have a 729-bp open reading frame encoding a 243-amino acid protein with 94% amino acid identity (Fig. 2 A). The murine cDNA has an in-frame stop codon at −15 (where +1 is the A of the putative initiation codon), supporting our designation of the initiation methionine. The putative initiation methionine codons in human and murine PHR1 cDNAs are surrounded by acceptable Kozak sequences (ACC ATG A) (51Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced PHR1 amino acid sequence has a PH domain near the N terminus (residues 21–128 in isoforms 1 and 2). The diagnostic features of this motif in PHR1 include a highly conserved Trp residue at the C terminus of the PH domain (Trp-119), two negatively charged residues located 4 and 5 amino acids upstream (Asp-114 and Asp-115), and a hydrophobic residue located 4 amino acids downstream (Leu-123) (Fig. 2). Musacchio and colleagues divided PH domains into six conserved blocks or subdomains (26Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The subdomains of the PHR1 PH domain compared with those from the four most similar PH domains identified in a BLAST search are shown in Fig. 2 B. These include: Akt, a serine-threonine protein kinase (52Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 53Coffer P.J.

An additional sequence feature of the PHR1 protein is a 27-amino acid hydrophobic α-helical segment at the C terminus (Gly-216 to Phe-243), suggestive of a transmembrane domain. Additionally, there are four consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (11–14 SALE, 15–18 SPFE, 58–61 TAQD, 112–115 TKDD) upstream of or in the PH domain, and a potential PKC phosphorylation site (141–143 SRR) just C-terminal of the PH domain. To determine the organization of the murine and humanPHR1 structural genes, we subcloned genomic fragments from both species. We sequenced ∼18 kb of the murine Phr1structural gene (AF071001) extending from 1.3 kb upstream of the transcription start site to the 3′ end of the gene. We also sequenced the exons and flanking intron junctions of the human structural gene (AF179306). The organization of both genes is summarized in Table I and the murine Phr1 gene is illustrated in Fig. 3. There are nine exons distributed over 18 kb. The exon/intron boundaries are all consistent with the splice site consensus sequences. The translation start site is in exon 2 (Fig. 3 A). The PH domain is encoded by sequence extending from mid-exon 3 to exon 6.Table IOrganization of human (a) and Murine (b) PHR1 genesExon/intronExon lengthIntron lengthNucleotide position in cDNAaThe A of the translation initiation codon (ATG) is designated as +1.Splicing acceptorExonSplicing donorbpa.

This actin will not polymerizein vitro but is compatible with cell viability. We have assessed the ability of Sac6p, the yeast homologue of the actin filament stabilizing and bundling protein fimbrin, to restore polymerization in vitro and to facilitate GG-actin functionin vivo. Sac6p rescues GG-actin polymerization at 25 °C but not at 4 °C. The actin polymerizes into bundles at room temperature with a fimbrin:actin molar ratio of 1:4. At this ratio, every actin monomer contacts a Sac6p actin binding domain. Following cold-induced depolymerization, actin/Sac6p mixtures repolymerize beginning at 15 °C instead of the 25 °C required for de novo assembly, because of the presence of residual actin-Sac6p nuclei. Generation of haploid Δsac6/GG-actin cells from either diploid or haploid cells was unsuccessful. The facile isolation of cells with either mutation alone indicates a synthetic lethal relationship between this actin allele and the SAC6 gene. Sac6p may allow GG-actin function in vivo by stabilizing the actin in bundles thereby helping maintain sufficient levels of an otherwise destabilized actin monomer within the cell.

Sac6p may allow GG-actin function in vivo by stabilizing the actin in bundles thereby helping maintain sufficient levels of an otherwise destabilized actin monomer within the cell. beryllium fluoride polymerase chain reaction actin binding domain wild type Actin, required for a number of intracellular processes ranging from muscle contraction to cytokinesis, has a primary structure that is largely conserved from yeast to human (1Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Actin is present in cells as two interchangeable forms, monomeric G-actin and filamentous F-actin. Actin filament stability is determined by a number of monomer/monomer contacts both along and perpendicular to the filament axis. A major source of cross-strand stabilization according to Holmes' model of F-actin (2Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 3Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) involves the interaction of hydrophobic residues in a subdomain 3/4 loop of an actin monomer with a hydrophobic pocket on the opposing strand of the filament. In yeast actin, this hydrophobic plug consists of four residues Val266–Leu267–Gly268–Leu269(1Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). One prediction of this proposal was that interference with the plug-pocket interaction would prevent polymerization of actin resulting in cytotoxicity. Our laboratory previously constructed an actin mutant (GG) in which the first two residues in the subdomain 3/4 loop were replaced by glycines (4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4412-4418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The GG mutant cells are cold-sensitive and slow growing, and at all temperatures cells contain no visible actin cables and are characterized by delocalized cortical patches. Purified GG actin alone cannot polymerize in vitro at any temperature tested. However, polymerization can be restored by inclusion of phalloidin or beryllium fluoride (BeFx),1although the effects of these agents on GG-actin polymerization differ in a temperature-dependent fashion. Phalloidin will rescue polymerization at temperatures all the way down to 4 °C, presumably because it forms an inter-strand interaction (3Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol.

J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which substitutes for the one disturbed by the GG mutation. BeFx on the other hand, restores polymerization at 25 °C but not at 4 °C (4Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1237-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This agent substitutes for the γ-phosphate of ATP that is released from the interior of the monomer following polymerization and restores the filament to a more stable ADP-Pi like state, apparently by strengthening monomer-monomer contacts along the filament axis (7Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Presumably, at some point, this increased stabilization is not enough to overcome the additional destabilization caused by decreasing temperature in the already compromised plug-pocket interaction, and the filament disassembles. The polymerization defect of the GG-mutant, coupled with its compatibility with yeast viability, contradicts the prediction of Holmes and colleagues (2Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 3Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) cited above. This result also immediately raises the question of what allows GG actin to function in vivo, since F-actin is required for actin-based processes.In vivo, actin function is modulated by a number of actin monomer-binding proteins and filament capping, cross-linking, severing, and bundling proteins (9Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One such protein is a Ca2+-sensitive filament bundling protein called fimbrin or plastin. Fimbrin was first identified as a component of the chicken intestinal brush border microvillus (10Bretscher A. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and exists in humans as three highly homologous isoforms, T-, L-, and I-plastin (11De Arruda M.V. Watson S. Lin C.S. Leavitt J. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Lin C.S. Shen W. Chen Z.P. Tu Y.H. Matsudaira P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fimbrin consists of one calcium binding domain and two tandem actin binding domains, ABD1 and ABD2. The calcium binding domain includes the first N-terminal 100 amino acids and contains two EF-hand motifs. Each of the actin binding domains is composed of two calponin homology subdomains (13Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Fimbrin binds to the actin filament between two adjacent monomers along the filament axis (14Hanein D. Volkmann N. Goldsmith S. Michon A.M. Lehman W. Craig R. DeRosier D. Almo S. Matsudaira P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and thus might be expected to stabilize GG-actin filaments in much the same way that BeFx does. In the presence of calcium, ABD1 is apparently occluded leading to an inhibition of the ability of the protein to bundle actin filaments. Sac6p, also known as yeast fimbrin, has 36–43% identity to human and chicken fimbrins, respectively (15Adams A.E. Botstein D. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The SAC6 gene was identified as a suppressor of a yeast actin mutation (16Adams A.E. Botstein D. Drubin D.G. Science. 1989; 243: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the protein encoded by this gene Sac6p was independently isolated by actin-filament affinity chromatography (17Drubin D.G. Miller K.G. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2551-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Sac6p colocalizes with actin in vivo (17Drubin D.G. Miller K.G. Botstein D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2551-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and is capable of bundling yeast actin filaments in vitro (15Adams A.E. Botstein D. Drubin D.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) although its ability to induce actin polymerization has not been described. With a complete SAC6gene deletion, the cell is viable but grows at a reduced rate at 23 °C and cannot grow at 37 °C. These null mutant cells do not have normal actin cables and exhibit an abnormal cortical actin distribution. In addition, they are defective in both morphogenesis and endocytosis (18Kubler E. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Human T- and L-plastin can complement the defect ofSAC6 deletion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Adams A.E. Shen W. Lin C.S. Leavitt J. Matsudaira P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that deletion of SAC6 leads to a substantial increase in the G/F actin ratio, presumably because of filament destabilization (20Karpova T.S. Tatchell K. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1483-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because of the properties associated with Sac6p in vitro, and the hypothesized function for the protein as an F-actin stabilizerin vivo, we wished to determine if Sac6p played a major role in the ability of the polymerization-defective mutant GG-actin to support yeast life. Here, we report our studies of the interaction of Sac6p with this mutant actin in vitro and the effect of deleting the SAC6 gene in a cell producing GG-actin as its only actin.

The oligodeoxynucleotides used for PCR were from the DNA Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Media for yeast growth and sporulation and methods for sporulation and tetrad analysis were as described (21Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Yeast wild-type and GG mutant actins were purified using a DNase I-agarose chromatography procedure as described previously (22Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. Carraway K. Carraway C.C. Practical Approaches in Cell Biology. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 99-122Google Scholar, 23Kron S.J. Drubin D.G. Botstein D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Actins were purified in the Ca2+-G form and stored in Ca2+-G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and used within 4 days following purification. Immediately before use, the actins were converted into the Mg2+-G form according to the procedure of Pollard (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Ca2+-G actin was incubated with EGTA and MgCl2at final concentrations of 0.2 and 0.1 mm, respectively, at 25 °C for 10 min. Experiments were performed in Mg2+-G buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.05 mmCaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol). Sac6p was purified from a protease-deficient yeast strain AAY1918, obtained from Alison E. M. Adams (University of Arizona), overexpressing Sac6p under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter. Induced cells were collected, resuspended in cold buffer, and frozen as beads in liquid nitrogen which were collected and stored at −80 °C. Sac6p was purified through the hydroxyapatite step as described by Sandrocket al. (25Sandrock T.M. O'Dell J.L. Adams A.E.M. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1635-1642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except the ammonium sulfate precipitation step was omitted. Polymerization of Mg2+ GG-actin at 25 °C was assessed by monitoring the increase in light scattering following the addition of MgCl2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively, in the absence or in the presence of Sac6p. Experiments were performed using a mini-cuvette with capacity of 150 μl in a thermostatted cuvette chamber of a SPEX Fluorolog 3 fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. To measure F-actin bundling induced by Sac6p, the material was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 rpm in a TLA-100 rotor in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge (26Honts J.E. Sandrock T.S. Brower S.M. O'Dell J.L. Adams A.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Centrifugation was performed at 25 °C. When centrifugation was complete, the contents of the pellet were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Following staining of the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the bands were quantitated by scanning densitometry. To measure total F-actin formation, the experiment was performed as just described except that centrifugation was performed at 70,000 rpm for 30 min. In all cases, the Sac6p was clarified by centrifugation at 70,000 rpm in a TLA-100 rotor 30 min at 4 °C before use. Actin samples were deposited on carbon-coated Formvar grids, negatively stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate, and visualized with a Hitachi model 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Central Electron Microscope Facility). Genotypes of yeast strains described below are shown in Table I. We first disrupted one of the chromosomal actin genes from strain Y266 with the HIS3 gene. A PstI site was introduced into the actin coding sequence in the codon for E 270, and an NcoI site was introduced at the beginning of the actin coding sequence. Neither of these changes altered the amino sequence of the protein. This actin sequence, along with the ACTI promoter and 3′-untranslated region, was isolated as an EcoI-BamHI fragment from pRSWT and cloned into pRS313 to make pRS313ACT. TheHIS3 gene was introduced between the NcoI andPstI sites of the actin coding sequence in pRS313ACT to make pRSΔact1::HIS3. TheEcoRI-BamHI fragment was removed from pRSΔact1::HIS3 and inserted into a chromosomal actin gene by homologous replacement to produce strain yPAR266-1. Correct insertion of the sequence was determined by PCR and Southern analysis.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeDiploidsy266aFrom Dr. Robert J.

Open table in a new tab We next integrated the coding sequence for GG-actin along with the yeast actin promoter at a ura3-52 site of yPAR266-1 by selecting for reconstitution of URA3 function to produce yPAR266-2 (27Butler G. McConnell D.J. Curr. Genet. 1988; 14: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The SAC6 gene was deleted from yPAR266-2 as follows. We obtained a plasmid from Allison Adams, pAAB123, containing the SAC6 gene whose coding sequence had been replaced by theLEU2 gene. An EcoRI-PstI fragment containing the SAC6 gene with the LEU2replacement was released and used to disrupt one of the SAC6genes of yPAR266-2 by homologous recombination to give yPAR266-3. Correct insertion of the gene was verified by PCR using three different sets of primers. Details of the proof are presented under “Results.” Strain yPAR266-2 was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. Twenty two haploid colonies with the phenotype his+, ura+ were identified which express only GG actin, and one, called yPAR266-4, was used for the following experiment. We then used the fragment from AAB123 to disrupt the SAC6 gene in this cell as above and selected for growth on leu− medium. No transformants were observed. Control experiments showed the cells were competent and that the fragment could transform diploid cells as above. The focus of this paper was to establish whether or not Sac6p, the yeast homologue of fimbrin, was an important factor in restoring the ability of the mutant GG actin to form functional filaments in vivo. We first assessed the ability of Sac6p to restore GG-actin polymerizability in vitro at 25 °C. In the absence of added Sac6p, the Mg2+ form of GG-actin remains in an unpolymerized state even in the presence of F-buffer (Fig. 1). When Sac6p was added at an actin:fimbrin ratio of 10:1, we observed an immediate increase in light scattering suggesting the fimbrin-induced formation of actin filaments. To ascertain the morphology of this scattering material, we examined the material at the end of the experiment by electron microscopy following negative staining of the sample. Fig. 2 shows Sac6p induces the formation of bundles of actin filaments instead of single filaments, in agreement with its known properties as a filament-bundling protein. The morphology of those bundles we observed was like those seen in the interaction of F-actin with fimbrin (28Glenney Jr., J.R. Kaulfus P. Matsudaira P. Weber K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9283-9288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With WT actin, fimbrin will cause maximum bundling at fimbrin:actin ratios much lower than the one used above. However, for rescue of GG-actin polymerizability, it might have been necessary for all actin monomer-monomer associations along the longitudinal axis to be stabilized by Sac6p. We thus determined what amount of Sac6p was required for maximal actin filament formation. The results, described in Fig. 3, demonstrate that at the actin and fimbrin concentrations used, maximum actin assembly occurred at a fimbrin:actin ratio of about 1:3. This is in good agreement with a value of 1 fimbrin to 2.5 actin monomers at saturation as determined previously with the Dictyostelium discoideum fimbrin homologue (29Prassler J. Stocker S. Mattiott G. Heidecker M. Gerisch G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To quantify the interaction between Sac6p and GG-actin better, we carried out a cosedimentation study. Sac6p and Mg2+-GG actin were combined in the presence of F-buffer at 25 °C, and assembly of the complex was allowed to proceed to completion. Aliquots of the resulting mixture were centrifuged at low speed, sufficient to pellet only large bundles, and at high speed, sufficient to pellet both bundles and individual actin filaments. The results are shown in Fig. 4. At a Sac6p:actin ratio of 1:1, essentially all of the actin pelleted under the low speed conditions, indicating that under these conditions few if any individual filaments were formed. In the absence of Sac6p, no actin was observed in the low speed pellet (data not shown). Densitometry of the actin and Sac6p bands showed that, for this experiment, the Sac6p:actin molar ratio in either the high or low speed pellet was approximately 1:1.5. We repeated the experiment at a Sac6p:actin initial ratio of 15:1 to determine the result of having a large excess of the Sac6p. The amount of material pelleted in the low speed centrifugation was decreased by 60%. However, examination of the pellet again showed a Sac6p:actin ratio of 1:1.5. To assess the behavior of the system at markedly subsaturating levels of Sac6p, we repeated the experiment at a Sac6p:actin ratio of 1:10. In this case the Sac6p:actin ratio in the high or low speed pellet was between 1:3 and 1:4 with about 50–60% of the actin pelleting in the low speed pellet. The result is consistent with the saturation curve presented in Fig. 3. This experiment was repeated four times with comparable results suggesting that the minimal amount of Sac6p needed for stabilization of a GG-actin filament is approximately one actin binding domain per two monomers along the filament axis. Furthermore, together with our EM data, these results suggest that at this initial ratio of Sac6p:actin, all of the actin that pellets is in the form of bundles and not individual filaments. Our previous work showed that mutations in the subdomain 3/4 hydrophobic plug where the GG mutation is located produce a cold-sensitive polymerization defect. In the case of GG-actin which does not polymerize at all by itself at 25 °C, BeFx, which strengthens longitudinal contacts along the filament axis, restores polymerization at 25 but not 4 °C. Since Sac6p binds along the filament axis, its ability to stabilize GG-actin filaments should exhibit the same type of cold sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we combined Sac6p and GG actin in F-buffer at 4 °C and followed the change in light scattering as a function of temperature. Fig. 5 demonstrates that no noticeable polymerization occurs until 25 °C. At this temperature polymerization ensues and rapidly reaches completion. We next determined whether pre-formed GG-actin-Sac6p assemblies were cold-sensitive. We also wished to know whether cold-induced disassembly, if it occurred, was reversible. GG-actin and Sac6p were coassembled in F-buffer at 25 °C, and the temperature was lowered to 4 °C. Fig. 6 shows that decreasing temperature led to a decrease in light scattering until at 4 °C where the total light scattering had decreased by 85%. We then raised the temperature. No polymerization was observed at 10 °C. However, at 15 °C we observed an immediate increase in light scattering which reached an intermediate plateau. Additional partial light scattering increases occurred at 20 and 25 °C until the original plateau level was reached. Examination of the samples at these intermediate positions revealed that at 4 °C, residual spherical or linear aggregates were present (Fig. 7 A). At 15 °C, although individual filaments were occasionally observed (Fig. 7 B2), the beginnings of small bundles were observed in the vast majority of fields (Fig. 7 B1). Finally, return of the temperature to 25 °C results in the formation of mature bundles with few if any noticeable free filaments resembling the behavior of material initially assembled at 25 °C (Fig. 7 C).FIG. 7EM images of GG-actin/Sac6p assemblies at different temperatures during the repolymerization experiment described in Fig. 6. Samples were removed following attainment of equilibrium at the temperatures indicated, negatively stained, and examined by electron microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, depolymerized sample at 4 °C;B, after repolymerization at 15 °C. C,following elevation of the sample to 25 °C. The barrepresents 0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We demonstrated above that in the presence of Sac6p, GG-actin assembled at lower temperatures if it had first been polymerized and then disassembled rather than polymerized de novo. This differential response suggested that the earlier onset of polymerization following disassembly might be due to the presence of residual Sac6p-actin complexes following the decrease in temperature to 4 °C. To test this hypothesis, we needed a method to dissociate completely the Sac6p from the actin. Earlier work with fimbrin homologues from both Dictyosteliumand humans demonstrated that the interaction of fimbrin with actin was inhibited in the presence of Ca2+ (29Prassler J. Stocker S. Mattiott G. Heidecker M. Gerisch G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Hanein D. Matsudaira P. DeRosier D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We wished to determine if the Sac6p-GG actin interaction was also calcium-sensitive. The Mg2+ form of monomeric GG-actin was combined with Sac6p in F-buffer in the presence of different calcium concentrations, and the change in light scattering was monitored as a function of time. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Two hundred μm Ca2+ drastically retarded the rate of polymerization in comparison with the Ca2+-free sample, whereas 400 μm Ca2+ completely inhibited Sac6p-dependent actin assembly. We then determined whether eliminating residual Sac6p-actin complexes by introducing Ca2+ following cold-induced disassembly would alter the repolymerization characteristics of the system. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Mg2+ GG-actin was polymerized at 25 °C in the presence of Sac6p. Following completion of polymerization, the temperature was reduced to 4 °C, and the mixture was allowed to disassemble until a plateau had been reached 20 min after the solution had reached 4 °C. Four hundred μm Ca2+ was then added and the solution allowed to incubate an additional 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, 400 μm EGTA was added, and the temperature was allowed to rise. We observed no increase in light scattering until the temperature of the solution had reached 25 °C, similar to the response seen forde novo polymerization of the sample. Based on our results that Sac6p could restore GG-actin polymerization in vitro, we wished to determine whether the reaction was required for maintenance of GG-actin function in vivo. We thus constructed a diploid strain of yeast, yPAR266-2, in which one of the chromosomal actin genes was disrupted with HIS3, and the GG-actin coding sequence was integrated in the chromosome along with the actin promoter at the ura3-52 site. The cells were sporulated, and 27 tetrads were dissected. Statistically, one-fourth of the spores should not be viable since they would have no active actin gene and one-fourth of the cells should express only GG-actin. From the 27 tetrads, 81 surviving colonies were obtained with 22 of them expressing only GG-actin. Thus, GG-actin appears completely compatible with germination and vegetative growth. We next used insertion of the LEU2 gene to delete one of the Sac6p coding sequences from strain yPAR266-2 and selected for the desired disrupted diploid cells by the ability to grow on leu− medium. Deletion of one of the genes was confirmed by PCR as shown in Fig. 10. Three sets of primers were used. Two sets included primers within the LEU2 coding sequence and sequences outside of both ends of the SAC6coding region. Each gave the fragment expected if the appropriate deletion had occurred. PCR using two primers within the SAC6coding region confirmed the presence of one active SAC6 gene in the diploid cells. Following sporulation, 100 tetrads were dissected, and the spores were allowed to germinate at 24 °C. Germination was poor with 29 surviving colonies from the maximum of 300 possible. None of these contained GG actin alone in the absence of Sac6p (Table II), although cells were isolated with an ACT1/Δsac6 genotype (his−, ura−, leu+). When DNA from these cells were subjected to PCR using primers within theSAC6 coding region, no amplification of DNA occurred, whereas with both diploid and haploid cells containing a functionalSAC6 gene, the expected band was observed. These results indicated that in terms of the ability to germinate and seed a colony, deletion of SAC6 is synthetically lethal in the presence of GG actin alone.Table IIHaploids from tetrad dissection of yPR266–3GenotypeColony no.a100 tetrads were dissected.ACT1/SAC65ACT1/GG/SAC611ACT1/GG/ΔSAC67ACT1/ΔSAC66a 100 tetrads were dissected.

We previously described a recessive nuclear mutation (crp3) that affects 3′-end formation of several chloroplast mRNAs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(Levy, H., Kindle, K. L., and Stern, D. B. (1997) Plant Cell 9, 825–836). In the crp3 background,atpB mRNA lacking a 3′-inverted repeat normally required for stability accumulates as a discrete transcript. The mutation also affects the atpA gene cluster; polycistronic mRNAs with psbI or cemA 3′-ends accumulate to a lower level in the crp3 background. Here, we demonstrate that the crp3 mutation also alters 3′-end formation of psbI mRNA and cemA-containing mRNAs. A novel 3′-end is formed in monocistronic psbItranscripts, and this is the only terminus observed when thepsbI 3′-untranslated region is fused to an aadAreporter gene. Accumulation of mRNAs with 3′-ends betweencemA and atpH, which is immediately downstream, was reduced. However, this sequence was not recognized as a 3′-end formation element in chimeric genes. The crp3 mutation was able to confer stability to three different atpB3′-stem-loop-disrupting mutations that lack sequence similarity, but are located at a similar distance from the translation termination codon. We propose that the wild-type CRP3 gene product is part of the general 3′ → 5′ processing machinery. Chloroplast mRNA maturation is catalyzed by nucleus-encoded processing enzymes. We previously described a recessive nuclear mutation (crp3) that affects 3′-end formation of several chloroplast mRNAs in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(Levy, H., Kindle, K. L., and Stern, D. B.

Many nuclear factors have been identified by genetic screens, e.g. in maize andArabidopsis by high chlorophyll fluorescence or leaf pigmentation patterns (3Barkan A. Walker M. Nolasco M. Johnson D.

Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These mutations are recessive and can affect one or several chloroplast transcripts. Progress in defining the precise targets of these nuclear factors has been limited to Chlamydomonas, where chloroplast transformation and the use of chimeric reporter genes are routine. Nuclear factors required for psbD and petDmRNA stability, for example, have been shown to interact with the 5′-untranslated region (UTR),1 protecting the mRNA from 5′ → 3′ exonucleolytic degradation (8Drager R.G. Girard-Bascou J. Choquet Y. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1998; 13: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Nickelsen J. van Dillewijn J. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D.

Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, point and deletion mutagenesis has been used to define potential sites of interaction between nuclear translation factors and the 5′-UTRs of petD (11Sakamoto W. Chen X. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant J. 1994; 6: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), psbD (10Nickelsen J. Fleischmann M. Boudreau E. Rahire M. Rochaix J.-D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a complex interplay between nuclear proteins and multiple cis-elements in chloroplast mRNAs. In contrast to the 5′-UTR, whose functions in mRNA stability and translation are relatively well described, the role of the 3′-UTR in chloroplast gene expression is enigmatic. Although stem-loop-forming inverted repeat structures are commonly found in the 3′-UTR and stabilize RNAs in vitro and in vivo (13Lee H. Bingham S.E. Webber A.N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 337-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14Stern D.B. Gruissem W. Cell. 1987; 51: 1145-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 15Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar), the inverted repeats can be replaced in vivo by a polyguanosine sequence, which also forms a strong secondary structure (16Drager R.G. Zeidler M. Simpson C.L. Stern D.B. RNA. 1996; 2: 652-663PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that at least for atpB mRNA, specific sequences are not required for formation of a stable 3′-end. Furthermore, the 3′-UTRs of various chloroplast genes are interchangeable both in tobacco (17Staub J.M. Maliga P. Plant J. 1994; 6: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and in Chlamydomonas (18Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 1998; 36: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), suggesting that gene-specific regulation is not accomplished through elements in this region. Nonetheless, the stabilizing functions of 3′-UTRs are often orientation-dependent (18Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Rott R. Liveanu V. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and recent data fromChlamydomonas suggest that 3′-end formation may stimulate translation initiation in vivo (20Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To address the function of the 3′-UTR in more depth, we have taken a molecular genetic approach. Previously, a series of 3′-deletions were engineered downstream of the atpB gene.Chlamydomonas strains with UTRs that lacked the potential to form a stable 3′-stem-loop structure grew slowly under photoautotrophic conditions, were sensitive to high intensity light, accumulated a reduced amount of atpB mRNA that was heterogeneous in size, and accumulated a similarly reduced level of the ATPase β-subunit, the product of the atpB gene (15Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of phenotypic revertants were isolated from a prototypical strain of this series, atpBΔ26, by virtue of their ability to grow rapidly on minimal medium and their tolerance of high light. One class resulted from a dramatic amplification of the mutant atpB gene in the chloroplast, so that heterogeneous and unstable RNA accumulated to a high level and thus increased ATPase accumulation (21Kindle K.L. Suzuki H. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 187-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second type resulted from a mutation in a nuclear gene, which we have termedCRP3 (chloroplast RNAprocessing). This recessive mutation allows a discrete transcript to accumulate from the 3′-deleted copy of atpB, which results in increased accumulation of the ATPase β-subunit due to enhanced transcript stability and more efficient translation (20Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the crp3 mutation also caused changes in other chloroplast transcripts, including accumulation of putative processing intermediates and altered stability of transcripts from theatpA gene cluster (22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CRP3 appears to encode a factor involved in the maturation of several chloroplast transcripts. In this report, we examine the specificity of suppression of RNA instability by crp3 and show that it has a target in the 3′-UTR. A possible role for CRP3 in wild-type cells is discussed. The strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Cells were grown in TAP medium (23Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use.

Rimbault B. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCEMA, which contains most of thecemA (ycf10) coding region, was generated by inserting a 1-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the chloroplast EcoRI fragment 22 into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). This plasmid served as a template for amplifying the entire insert by PCR using T7 and T3 primers, and the PCR fragment was used as a probe in RNA filter hybridizations. ThepsbI coding region probe was inserted into pBluescript SK+ as a 296-base pair PCR-amplified fragment using primers psbI1 and psbI3, covering from −35 relative to the translation initiation codon to + 93 relative to the termination codon. ThepsbI-cemA intergenic region was amplified with primers psbI2 and psbI4, covering from −31 to +405 relative to thepsbI termination codon. The cemA-atpHintergenic region was amplified with primers cemA1 and cemA2, covering from −44 to +207 relative to the cemA termination codon. Primers psbI2 and cemA1 had added SphI sites, and primers psbI4 and cemA2 had added XbaI sites. The psbI2-psbI4 and cemA1-cemA2 PCR products were inserted into pBluescript SK+, and the orientation of the inserts was determined byXbaI digestion. Since pBluescript has one XbaI site in its polylinker, in one of the orientations, the PCR fragment could be excised as an XbaI fragment. This fragment was cloned into XbaI-digested pDAAD, which contains theaadA selectable marker downstream of the atpBgene (25Rott R. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar). The orientation of the insertions was determined by digesting with SphI, as one site was present in the insert, and a second site was present in pDAAD between the aadAcoding region and the rbcL 3′-UTR. For 3′-end mapping of atpBΔ24 and atpBΔ27 RNAs, the atpB 3′-regions from each strain were PCR-amplified using primers 9001 and 8901 (15Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the EcoRV site of T-tailed pBluescript SK (26Holton T.A. Graham M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Chlamydomonaschloroplast transformation was carried out as described previously (15Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by their ability to grow on TAP plates containing 100 μg/ml spectinomycin. Transformants were colony-purified, and the expected insertions were confirmed by DNA filter hybridizations and appropriate PCR amplifications (data not shown). For whole-cell nucleic acid preparations, cells were grown in TAP medium, and RNA was isolated as described previously (22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was size-fractionated on 6% formaldehyde and 1.1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with32P-labeled probes as described previously (22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′-ends of atpB, psbI, and cemAtranscripts were mapped using the plasmids described above and RNase protection as described previously (27Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gel imaging and quantification were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The Chlamydomonas atpA gene cluster contains four genes, which are transcribed into eight known mono- and polycistronic mRNAs, as shown in Fig. 1 (diagram) and described previously (24Drapier D. Suzuki H. Levy H. Rimbault B. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Kunstner P. Guardiola A. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.-D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6713-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The crp3 mutation was previously shown to affect the accumulation of mRNAs that terminate downstream of the psbI and cemA (ycf10) coding regions; the amount of psbI-terminated RNAs was moderately reduced, whereas the amount of cemA-terminated RNAs was strongly reduced (22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the crp3mutation on these RNAs in detail, we performed filter hybridizations using total RNA extracted from wild-type, crp3, or atpAΔ3 cells (24Drapier D. Suzuki H. Levy H. Rimbault B. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); in atpAΔ3, the psbI promoter has been deleted. Fig. 1 A shows the results of probing with thepsbI coding region. In wild-type cells, six RNAs were detected of which the most abundant was the monocistronicpsbI message, transcript 7. In crp3 cells, it was expected that RNAs 2, 3, 6, and 7 might be affected since their 3′-ends are downstream of psbI or cemA. Indeed, RNA 2 was virtually undetectable; however, only a small change, if any, was seen in the accumulation of the bands corresponding to RNAs 3 and 6, which are similar in size. Most remarkably, a new species was observed that migrated slightly slower than RNA 7; this is marked as RNA 7* in Fig. 1 A. This suggested that monocistronic psbImRNA might be aberrantly processed in crp3 cells. This is supported by results from atpAΔ3, in which thepsbI-proximal promoter has been deleted: neither RNA 7 nor the new transcript was observed. However, RNA 3 accumulated to a high level (it is shorter due to the atpΔ3 deletion). This suggests thatcrp3 selectively affects transcripts terminating downstream of psbI. The difference in size between the wild-type and novel monocistronicpsbI mRNAs could result from differences at the 5′- and/or 3′-end(s). The 5′-end of psbI mRNA was mapped by primer extension, using total RNA from wild-type and crp3cells, as described previously (24Drapier D. Suzuki H. Levy H. Rimbault B. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and no differences were observed between wild-type and crp3 cells (data not shown). The 3′-end of psbI mRNA was mapped by RNase protection, using a uniformly labeled antisense RNA spanning the intergenic region between psbI and cemA. As shown in Fig. 1 B, two major protected bands were obtained using wild-type RNA. The longer fragment (readthrough) represents protection by RNAs 1, 2, 5, and 6, whereas the shorter fragment (wt) represents protection by RNAs 3 and 7. By comparison with a DNA sequencing ladder, the psbI 3′-end was mapped to 83 ± 3 nucleotides downstream of the psbI termination codon (data not shown). In crp3, an ∼50% reduction in the level of transcripts with the wild-type psbI 3′-end was observed (wt- crp3). In addition, a longer protected product that represents a novel psbI 3′-end accumulated. This product is ∼100 nucleotides longer than the wild-type product, represents ∼50% of the psbI 3′-ends, and corresponds to RNA 7* in Fig. 1 A and possibly to a slightly longer RNA 3. In an attempt to distinguish between the 3′-ends of RNAs 3* and 7*, we took advantage of the fact that in strain atpAΔ3, RNA 3 accumulates, but RNA 7 does not (Fig. 1 A). The 3′-ends ofpsbI-containing transcripts were again mapped by RNase protection, using total RNA from atpAΔ3 and atpAΔ3-crp3; the latter strain was constructed by crossing atpAΔ3-mt+to crp3-mt−. As shown in the last two lanes of Fig. 1 B, the wild-type 3′-ends downstream ofpsbI were also present in the atpAΔ3 strains, although at a lower level in the crp3 background. The novelpsbI 3′-end, on the other hand, accumulated to a low, but detectable level in atpAΔ3-crp3 and must represent a modified version of transcript 3. The observation of a novel 3′-end partially explains the reduction in the atpA-psbI(RNA 3) level reported previously for crp3 and atpAΔ3-crp3 (atpAΔ3 was referred to as Δ12 in this earlier paper (22Levy H. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). However, the level of RNA 3* in thecrp3 background appears to be less than expected from the amount of RNA 7*, suggesting an unexpected contribution of the 5′-end to the process of 3′-formation and/or RNA stability. ThecemA transcript does not accumulate in a monocistronic form, but only in polycistronic mRNAs transcribed from theatpA and psbI promoters (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 (diagram and A) highlights the four cemA-containing transcripts, which in wild-type cells areatpA-psbI-cemA-atpH (RNA 1), atpA-psbI-cemA (RNA 2),psbI-cemA-atpH (RNA 5), andpsbI-cemA (RNA 6). In the crp3background, a substantial decrease in the levels of RNAs 2 and 6 was observed; these are the two transcripts that terminate betweencemA and atpH. When gels were run longer to increase resolution (see Fig. 4 A), it was clear that the reduction in RNA 6 abundance was accompanied by an accumulation of a slightly larger species (RNA 6*) that, based on its estimated size, had its 3′-end within the atpH coding region. Furthermore, the reduction in RNA 6 was accompanied by an increase in RNA 5, consistent with a precursor-product relationship.FIG. 4Suppression of RNA instability in otheratpB 3′-UTR deletions by crp3.To analyze suppression of the atpBΔ24 ( A )and atpBΔ27 ( B ) deletions, total RNA from the indicated strains (a–d are tetrad products from the cross shown above them) was subjected to gel electrophoresis and filter hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using an atpB coding region probe, psbA as a loading control, or cemA to determine crp3 genotype. Thecrp3 genotype is indicated as w (wild-type, no suppression) or m (mutant, suppresses atpBΔ26). RNA species in the cemA panel are indicated bynumbers and refer to the diagram. The approximate locations of the 5′ termini of the atpB 3′-deletions in each strain are indicated at the bottom center. wt, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To discern whether 3′-end maturation downstream of cemA is modified in crp3 and to detect any residual RNA 2, RNase protection was performed using the uniformly labeled antisense RNA probe corresponding to the cemA-atpH intergenic region, as shown in Fig. 2 (diagram). Fig. 2 Bshows the results of this experiment. Two major species were protected by RNA from wild-type cells, the shorter one representing the 3′-ends of RNAs 2 and 6 and the longer one representing RNAs 1 and 5, which contain atpH (readthrough). In the mutant background (crp3), the cemA 3′-end accumulated to a lower level, which was expected since RNA 6 was clearly reduced in abundance. To examine RNA 2, 3′-ends between cemA andatpH were mapped in strain atpAΔ3-crp3, which fails to accumulate RNAs 5 and 6 due to a deletion of thepsbI promoter. In atpAΔ3 cells, the amount of probe protected by cemA 3′-ends was reduced relative to wild-type cells. This is consistent with our previous observation that whereas RNA 2 increases in abundance in atpAΔ3 cells relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 1 A), this increase is not in proportion to the decline in RNA 6 (see Fig. 6 in Ref. 24Drapier D. Suzuki H. Levy H. Rimbault B. Kindle K.L. Stern D.B. Wollman F.-A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In atpAΔ3-crp3cells, a further reduction in probe protected by cemA3′-ends compared with the wild-type sibling (atpAΔ3) was observed however, the protected product was clearly present. This suggests that although not readily detectable on RNA filter blots, RNA 2 does accumulate to some extent in the crp3 background. However, unlike psbI, no heterogeneity in the size of the protected band was seen, suggesting that any processing that takes place betweencemA and psbI occurs at the same site as in wild-type cells. It should be noted that the size of the probe protected by RNA 8 would be only 31 nucleotides and therefore not visible in this experiment. Furthermore, the novel RNA 6*, which apparently has a 3′-end within theatpH coding region, would fully protect the probe and contribute slightly to the band labeled readthrough. The psbI-cemA intergenic region confers correct or modified 3′-end processing to a chimeric mRNA, but thecemA-atpH region does not. To test whether thepsbI-cemA and cemA-atpHintergenic regions contain information sufficient for the recognition of mRNA processing or stability functions altered incrp3, we tested the ability of these regions to serve as RNA-processing sites in the context of a bacterial aadAreporter gene engineered to be expressed in Chlamydomonaschloroplasts (30Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Fig. 3(diagram) shows the configuration of these four constructs, in which the intergenic regions were inserted in the two possible orientations between the aadA coding region and theChlamydomonas chloroplast rbcL 3′-UTR. The promoter and 5′-UTR were from the Chlamydomonas chloroplastpetD gene. The original petD-aadA-rbcLcassette produces translationally competent mRNAs, which confer spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance to transformed cells (25Rott R. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar). We rationalized that if the inserted intergenic sequences were sufficient to promote 3′-end formation, a shorter mRNA ending at the processing site would accumulate. Otherwise, a longer mRNA that represents processing at the rbcL 3′-end would accumulate. In either case, the mRNA was expected to be stable and to confer antibiotic resistance. Indeed, spectinomycin-resistant transformants were recovered when this construct was introduced into both the wild-type (CRP3) and crp3 mutant strains, and these transformants contained the desired DNA configurations. Typical RNA accumulation patterns from the transformants and control strains are shown in Fig. 3. The middle panel shows results with an atpB probe. As expected, no discrete transcript accumulated in atpBΔ26, the wild-type recipient strain for the transformation (see “Experimental Procedures”), whereas a low amount of a discrete transcript was detected in the other recipient, atpBΔ26-crp3 (the crp3 mutation stabilizes the normally unstable atpB transcript). In all the transformants, atpB mRNA accumulation was wild-type since the atpBΔ26 deletion had been replaced with wild-type sequences during transformation (see diagram in Fig. 3). Fig. 3 (lower panel) shows results with a cemAprobe. This probe provided verification of the nuclear background; lanes with a low level of RNA 2 and a high level of RNA 5 carry thecrp3 mutation. Probing with aadA, as shown in theupper panel, revealed the transcripts produced from the chimeric genes. For psbI insertions downstream of theaadA coding region, different results were obtained depending on the orientation of the insertion. In the (+)-orientation and in the wild-type background, a mRNA that corresponds to processing in the psbI 3′-UTR accumulated, indicating that the psbI-cemA intergenic region carries sufficient information to direct maturation of the psbI3′-end. In the crp3 background, a slightly larger transcript accumulated. Based on its size, this transcript most likely terminates at the novel psbI 3′-end as in RNA 7* (Fig. 1 A). However, there was little evidence for accumulation ofaadA-psbI transcripts with the wild-type 3′-end. These results indicate that for the psbI 3′-end, thepsbI-cemA intergenic region included in these constructs includes sequences sufficient for processing and stability in the crp3 background. In transformants containing the psbI 3′-UTR in the (−)-orientation, little or no RNA processed at the psbI3′-end could be detected. Mainly the longer mRNA processed at therbcL 3′-end accumulated, and the crp3 mutation had no effect. This indicates that the psbI 3′-UTR functions in an orientation-dependent manner, as has been reported previously for other 3′-UTRs in Chlamydomonas chloroplasts (18Blowers A.D. Klein U. Ellmore G.S. Bogorad L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Rott R. Liveanu V. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The longer transcripts were also seen when thepsbI 3′-UTR was in the (+)-orientation, although in a reduced amount. This is consistent with inefficient transcription termination and incomplete processing. Transcription termination atChlamydomonas chloroplast 3′-inverted repeats has previously been reported to be inefficient (25Rott R. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 676-683PubMed Google Scholar). However, previous examples of chimeric constructs with two adjacent inverted repeats resulted in accumulation of only the shorter transcript, suggesting that the 3′-psbI processing site may be less efficient than those downstream of atpB (27Stern D.B. Kindle K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2277-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For strains containing the chimeric constructs with thecemA-atpH intergenic region downstream ofaadA, results were identical regardless of the orientation or nuclear background. In each case, only the longer mRNA, processed at the rbcL 3′-end, could be detected. Therefore, the cemA-atpH intergenic region is not sufficient for correct 3′-end maturation in this context. Possibly, additional sequences within the atpH coding region are required to confer processing activity. Indirect evidence for this is that the new RNA 6*, unique to crp3 and discussed above, may terminate within the atpH coding region, suggesting that a determinant recognized by crp3 resides in this region. Various deletions in the atpB 3′-UTR that eliminate part or all of the potential stem-loop structure cause mRNA heterogeneity and instability (15Stern D.B. Radwanski E.R. Kindle K.L. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 285-297PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kindle K.L. Suzuki H. Stern D.B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 187-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

This DNA polymerase, encoded by the viral pol gene, is one of the current targets of inhibitors aimed at controlling the replication of this pathogen. The clinical importance of HIV has led to extensive studies of its RT. RT shares structural similarities with both DNA and RNA polymerases. Primary sequence homology with other polymerases has been useful in identifying both catalytically important amino acids and functional domains (1Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 2Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The comparison of the crystal structure of RT with other polymerases whose structure is available suggests that all polymerases have a common mechanism for nucleotide polymerization (3Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M. Science. 1994; 266: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The overall structure of these enzymes can be compared with an open right hand holding the 3′-end of the primer annealed to its template in the “palm” between the “thumb” and “fingers” domains (5Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Several conserved signature sequences, designated from A to E, have been identified using amino acid sequence alignments (6Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Motifs A and C, present in all polymerases, are located in the palm domain and contain conserved acidic amino acids essential for catalysis (1Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 2Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Two aspartic acid residues that coordinate a magnesium ion are part of the polymerase active site. Motifs A and C are present in all nucleic acid polymerases (1Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 2Braithwaite D.K. Ito J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 787-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The function of motif B in the fingers domain has been defined both structurally and biochemically for DNA polymerases from the Pol I family: Thermus aquaticus(Taq) DNA polymerase (7Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I (8Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and the DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Motif B consists a α-helix designated also as “helix O” in the Klenow fragment structure (5Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase in complex with a template primer and a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate, it appears that upon binding to DNA and the correct nucleotide the fingers domain rotates inwards toward the polymerase active site. This conformational change brings conserved residues of helix O in contact with the incoming nucleotide (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). RT has a domain of two anti-parallel β-strands named β3 and β4 spatially equivalent to helix O of motif B. Indirect evidence suggests that this domain has the same role in nucleotide binding as motif B. Amino acid changes in this domain lead to resistance to nucleotide analogues in viral strains carrying these mutations (10Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and an antibody designed to recognize an epitope located in motif B acts as a competitive inhibitor for nucleotides during polymerization (11Wu J. Amandoron E. Li X. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9980-9985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, another role for the β3/β4 strands was proposed in which the β3/β4 strands would make contacts with the single-stranded template instead of the incoming nucleotide (12Boyer P.L. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this model, the single-stranded template would pass through the cleft formed by the fingers, palm, and thumb domains. During the course of our study, the crystal structure of a ternary complex of RT-DNA-nucleotide was determined at 3.2 Å resolution (13Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). This structure is presented in Fig. 1. A large cleft, which accommodates the template primer, is a common feature of all polymerases whose structure is known. Like T7 and Taq DNA polymerases, the crystal structure of the RT ternary complex shows that the single-stranded template does not pass through the crevice between the fingers and thumb, but instead lies on the surface of the finger as the result of a sharp kink in the template strand (9, 13, and 14). The last nucleotide at the 3′-end of the primer stacks against the incoming nucleotide, which in turn stacks against the fingers domain (Fig. 1). This domain is helix O of motif B in T7 and Taq DNA polymerases (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) or the β3 strand in RT (Fig. 1 and Ref. 13Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Consequently, despite their structural differences, both motif B and β3/β4 strands are likely to interact with the nucleotide before the catalytic step. In addition to these three motifs, RNA-directed polymerases contain in their palm region an additional motif, motif D, that is not found in other DNA polymerases (6Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Motif D is located in the palm domain and forms a small loop from Thr-215 to Lys-223 of HIV-1 RT. The role of motif D is unknown. Because motif D is unique to RNA-directed polymerases, one possible role would be that it confers specificity for the RNA template (6Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Sousa R. Chung Y.J. Rose J.P. Wang B.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, both its location in the palm domain and the fact that several amino acid changes such as T215(F/Y) and K219Q that lead to nucleoside analogue resistance are found in this motif of RT suggest otherwise (10Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that motif D participates in nucleotide selection and catalysis and not in template specificity. The RT gene cloned into a M13 bacteriophage vector to give mpRT4 has been described (16Larder B.A. Purifoy D. Powell K.L. Darby G.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). mpRT4 single-stranded DNA was used to construct a RT gene carrying five additional unique restriction sites (NruI, SalI,HpaI, SacI, and Eco47III) that do not alter the wild-type amino acid sequence. Using the first C of Pro-1 codon of the RT gene as a reference, the nucleotide position of the first base of the recognition sequence of these sites are 182, 223, 639, 897, and 1657 for NruI, SalI,HpaI, SacI, and Eco47III, respectively. These silent sites correspond to amino acids 62, 73, 214, 233, and 553, respectively. This gene expressing wild-type RT was subcloned into the vector pTrc99A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield p66RT1 using the same strategy as described (17Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A synthetic, phosphorylated double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying six histidine codons immediately before the stop codon was ligated between the dephosphorylated Eco47III and HindIII sites of p66RT1 to yield p66RT2. The HpaI site present in the vector backbone at nucleotide position 3909 using the pTrc99A sequence as the reference was eliminated by mutagenesis to yield p66RT7. To introduce mutations between residue 62 and 73, p66RT7 was digested withNruI and SalI, dephosphorylated, and ligated to a double-stranded, phosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide carrying the desired mutated codon. The same strategy was used to introduce mutations within the HpaI-SacI DNA fragment corresponding to peptide fragment Leu-214 to Lys-233. All plasmid constructions containing RT genes were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. E. coliXL1-Blue (Stratagene) was used to express RT genes. In some instances, RT without histidine extension was purified as described (17Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RT were overproduced in E. coli and purified as p66/p66 homodimers using conventional chromatographic methods (17Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or using metal chelate chromatography (Qiagen). All preparations of RT were >95% pure as determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The purified wild-type enzyme had a specific activity from 8000 to 9500 units/mg protein. One unit of enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of DE-81 absorbable dTMP in 10 min at 37 °C using poly(rA)·oligo(dT)19 as a template primer. RT concentrations were determined using a standard colorimetric assay and spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients of Katiet al. (18Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were obtained from Oligos Etc. Inc. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using phosphatase-free bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase purified and provided by S. Tabor (Harvard Medical School). All32P-labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3′-Deoxy- and 2′3′-dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (ddNTPs and dNTPs) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (AZTTP) was synthesized and purified at the Institut Pasteur (Paris, France). Synthesis of DNA primers containing a p-azidophenacyl photo-reactive probe has been described (19Canard B. Sarfati R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11279-11284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The affinity of RT for its template primer was analyzed by UV cross-linking of RT to a labeled DNA primer. Thep-azidophenacyl modified 21-mer primer was labeled with32P at the 5′-end and annealed to a 31-mer DNA as described (19Canard B. Sarfati R. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11279-11284Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RT (250 nm) was mixed (1:1 v/v) with an equimolar amount of 5′-32P template primer on parafilm laid on a flat, ice-cold surface in a 10-μl final volume of 10% glycerol, 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl. The mixture was irradiated (λ = 365 nm) with a two-bulb 15-W UV lamp at a distance of 2 cm to yield an UV irradiation dose of 0.1–0.2 W/cm2. The mixture was heated in loading buffer containing 80% formamide, 4% SDS, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 3 min and loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Gels were covered with cellophane wrap, radioactive signals were measured using a Fuji imaging apparatus, and the gel was exposed to x-ray films. The efficiency of cross-linking of RT to the photoprobe-coupled labeled primer depends on the affinity of RT for the template primer. The affinity constant K d of wild-type RT for its template primer is known (17Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Comparison of cross-linking efficiencies of variant RTs relative to that of wild-type RT was used to determine the K d of variant RTs for template primer. To determine how the concentration of the complex made of RT cross-linked to template primer [ED] varied with K d of RT for template primer, the former complex [ED] was plotted againstK d using Equation 5, derived as follows. Kd=[E][D]/[ED](Eq. 1) [E0]=[E]+[ED](Eq. 2) [D0]=[D]+[ED](Eq. 3) where [E0], [D0], [E], [D], [ED], and K d are initial RT, initial template primer, free RT, free template primer, free RT-template primer complex concentrations, and the equilibrium constant K d of RT for the template primer, respectively. Combining Equations (Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3)yields the following. −[D]2+[D]([D0]−[E0]−Kd)−Kd[D0]=0(Eq. 4) In our assay, [D0] = [E0] = 250 nm. Solving for [D] and using Equation 3 yields the following. [ED]=[D0]−[Kd±((−Kd)2+1000·Kd)0.5]/−2(Eq. 5) Plotting [ED] as a function of chosen values ofK d models how the RT-template primer cross-linked complex [ED] varies according to the affinity constantK d of a given variant RT for its template primer. Using K d = 5 nm for wild-type RT (17Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and Equation 5, the difference between two cross-linked RT-primer complexes as seen on a gel indicates how different theirK d values are. In other words, for any variant RT the percentage of variation of [ED] relative to wild-type RT seen as a cross-linked species on a gel and Equation 5 can be used to calculateK d of the variant RT. Data analysis was performed using nonlinear regression and the Kaleidagraph 3.0 software for MacIntosh (Abelbeck Software, Inc). K d values were also determined using a kinetic assay and poly(rA)·oligo(dT)19 as a template primer system as described Huber et al. (25Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis from a preformed complex of polymerase and template primer is limited to a single processive cycle. Varying concentrations of poly(rA)·oligo(dT)19 ranging from 1 to 120 nmwere incubated with three different concentrations of RT, 10, 5, or 2.5 nm enzyme in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100 on ice for 1 min. The reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 150 μm dTTP and 500 nm poly(rC).(dG)20 to serve as a trap. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Aliquots were spotted onto DE-81 filter papers. The filter papers were washed three times with 0.3m ammonium formate and once with 95% ethanol. The radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The affinity for the template primer was expressed as an average of the values obtained from an Eadie-Hofstee plot . Processivity of nucleotide polymerization was measured using a 5′-32P-labeled oligo(dT)19 primer annealed to poly(rA). The template average length was 612 nucleotides and was annealed to primer using a 1:1 molar ratio calculated using nucleotide concentration. The template primer (10 nm) was incubated with RT (20 nm) for less than 2 min in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100) at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm dTTP in the absence or presence of 2 μg/μl heparin to serve as a trap and incubated at 25 °C. After 1 and 5 min, an aliquot of the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of gel loading buffer made of 90% formamide, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 10 mm EDTA. The optimum trap concentration was found to be 2 μg/μl of heparin for wild-type RT and the two mutant HIV-1 RT (data not shown). Electrophoretic analysis was performed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was analyzed as described above. RT activity was determined by monitoring the formation of radioactively labeled nucleic acid product absorbed onto DE-81 ion exchange paper discs. Reactions were carried out in RT buffer in the presence of 50 μg/μl poly(rA)·oligo(dT)19, poly(rC)·oligo(dG)19, or poly(rU)·oligo(dA)21 in conjunction with 100 μm of [3H]dTTP (36 μCi/μmol), 100 μm [α-32P]dGTP (0.2 μCi/μl), or 100 μm [α-32P]dATP (0.2 μCi/μl), respectively. After addition of RT, aliquots were withdrawn at several time points and spotted onto DE-81 paper discs. To determine theK m for dNTP, template primers were kept at a saturating concentration of 200 nm, and the concentrations of the corresponding dNTP were varied from 2 μm to 1 mm. The RT concentration was 20 nm. Filter paper discs were washed three times for 10 min in 0.3 mammonium formate, pH 8.0, washed two times in ethanol, and dried. The radioactivity bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For nucleotide analogue inhibition assays, poly(rA)·oligo(dT)19 was used as the template primer. AZTTP is a competitive inhibitor of dTTP (26Lacey S.F. Reardon J.E. Furfine E.S. Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Eckert K.A. Kemp S.D. Larder B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15789-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine K i (AZTTP), the dTTP concentration was kept constant and equal to K m (dTTP) determined as described above. AZTTP concentration was varied, andK i was determined as being equal to the concentration of AZTTP producing 50% inhibition of the polymerization reaction. To compare RT variants under the same experimental conditions, the concentration of dTTP was kept constant at 100 μm, while concentrations of either AZTTP or ddTTP were varied as indicated. Polymerase activity was normalized using the uninhibited reaction as a reference. Using wild-type RT, the concentration of AZTTP and ddTTP producing a 50% inhibition of polymerase activity (IC50) was 0.1 and 0.3 μmfor AZTTP and ddTTP, respectively. For a given RT, discrimination of the analogue was calculated as the ratio of measured IC50to the IC50 of wild-type RT. The degree of AZTTP and ddTTP discrimination was also examined by gel analysis of primer extension products (20Carroll S.S. Geib J. Olsen D.B. Stahlhut M. Shafer J.A. Kuo L.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2113-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dTTP, and 100 nmpoly(rA)[chemo]5′-32P·oligo(dT)19 template primer was incubated with 50 nm enzyme either in the presence or absence of 100 μm AZTTP or ddTTP as indicated. The reaction (10 μl) was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and terminated by the addition of an equal volume of stop solution. The products were analyzed as described above. The coordinates of RT were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base. Their accession numbers are indicated in the text and figure legends. The crystal structure models were displayed using INSIGHT II, SETOR, and the TURBO graphics programs (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar). Structural alignment was performed using the RIGID option of TURBO. We have investigated the role of motif D of HIV-1 RT in reverse transcription and DNA-dependent nucleotide polymerization. On one hand, this motif is found specifically in RNA-dependent DNA and RNA polymerases as opposed to DNA-dependent polymerases, suggesting a role in template specificity (6Sousa R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 186-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, motif D is located in the palm domain of RT away from the template track (13Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, two (T215(F/Y) and K219Q) out of five clinically relevant amino acid changes (M41L, D67N, K70R, T215(F/Y), and K219Q) involved in AZT resistance are located in this motif, suggesting a role in nucleotide selection (10Tantillo C. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Pauwels R. Andries K. Janssen P.A. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 22Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. CSHL Press, town, state1992: 205-222Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to determine whether amino acid changes in motif D would affect template specificity or interaction with the nucleotide during DNA polymerization. Therefore, we generated RT variants altered in motif D and characterized their template primer binding properties as well as their kinetics of nucleotide incorporation. The alignment of motif D from various RNA-dependent DNA polymerases is shown in Fig. 2 A. Two amino acids are strictly conserved in this motif: Gly-213 and Lys-220, using HIV-1 RT amino acid numbering as a reference (16Larder B.A. Purifoy D. Powell K.L. Darby G.K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the possible role of motif D, we took advantage of the observation that Pol I-type polymerases do not have an identifiable motif D. We have superimposed crystal structures of polymerases possessing a motif D, such as HIV-1 RT and MuMLV RT, onto those of Pol I-type polymerases that lack motif D, such as Taq DNA polymerase (7Eom S.H. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), Klenow fragment (8Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and T7 DNA polymerase (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The three conserved acidic amino acids located in the polymerase active site were chosen as anchoring points (3Steitz T.A. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Joyce C.M. Science. 1994; 266: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Yadav P.N. Yadav J.S. Arnold E. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 716-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The result of this superimposition is shown in Fig. 3 A. For clarity the only RT structure shown is HIV-1 RT (Protein Data Bank accession number1RT1) (24Esnouf R. Ren J. Ross C. Jones Y. Stammers D. Stuart D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and it is compared with Pol I-type DNA polymerases cited above. The nucleotide ddGTP is taken from the ternary complex of T7 DNA polymerase-DNA-nucleotide together with two magnesium ions at the active site. Taking HIV-RT amino acid numbering as a reference, it can be seen that motif D contains a unique loop made of residues Thr-215 to Lys-223 protruding into the solvent. There is no structurally equivalent loop in Pol I-type polymerases (Fig. 3 A). Lys-220 of RT is located at the tip of the loop facing the β3 and β4 strands. These strands are the structural equivalents of helix O of type I DNA polymerases. The corresponding helix of T7 DNA polymerase is shown together with the bound nucleotide ddGTP as seen in the structure of the T7 DNA polymerase complex (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M.

Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) crystal structures were superimposed using three catalytic acidic residues conserved in all polymerases (D110/D185/D186, D705/D882/E883, D610/D785/E786, and D475/D654/E655 for RT, Klenow fragment, Taq, and T7 DNA pol, respectively). The nucleotide ddGTP is taken from the ternary complex made of T7 DNA polymerase-DNA-nucleotide together with the two magnesium ions (shown as purple spheres) at the active site (9Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). The zones shown correspond to motifs A, B, C, and D as indicated. The orientation of the DNA (not shown) is from the bottom right corner to the nucleotide ddGTP. α-Carbons of Pol I-type polymerases in the vicinity of the α-carbon of Thr-215 of RT are Asp-691 for T7 DNA polymerase, Leu-915 for Klenow fragment, and Glu-817 for Taq DNA polymerase. Likewise, the α-carbon of Lys-223 of RT is in the vicinity of Gly-697 for T7 DNA polymerase, Gly-921 for Klenow fragment, and Gly-822 for Taq DNA polymerase. B, RT crystal structures (1RT1, shown in green, and 1RTD, shown inred) (13Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

https://openalex.org/W2033947205,"The enzyme 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate in either a dehydrogenase or hydrolase reaction. The hydrolase reaction occurs in a 310-residue amino-terminal domain of FDH (N(t)-FDH), whereas the dehydrogenase reaction requires the full-length enzyme. N(t)-FDH shares some sequence identity with several 10-formyltetrahydrofolate-utilizing enzymes. All these enzymes have a strictly conserved aspartate, which is Asp(142) in the case of N(t)-FDH. Replacement of the aspartate with alanine, asparagine, glutamate, or glutamine in N(t)-FDH resulted in complete loss of hydrolase activity. All the mutants, however, were able to bind folate, although with lower affinity than wild-type N(t)-FDH. Six other aspartate residues located near the conserved Asp(142) were substituted with an alanine, and these substitutions did not result in any significant changes in the hydrolase activity. The expressed D142A mutant of the full-length enzyme completely lost both hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities. This study shows that Asp(142) is an essential residue in the enzyme mechanism for both the hydrolase and dehydrogenase reactions of FDH, suggesting that either the two catalytic centers of FDH are overlapped or the dehydrogenase reaction occurs within the hydrolase catalytic center."

Like many G protein-coupled receptors, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor contains an apolar amino acid in this region at a constant distance from conserved Pro and Tyr/Asn residues in the fifth transmembrane domain (TM V). An analysis of the role of this conserved residue (Leu237) in GnRH receptor function revealed that the binding affinities of the L237I and L237V mutant receptors were unchanged, but their abilities to mediate GnRH-induced inositol phosphate signaling, G protein coupling, and agonist-induced internalization were significantly impaired. Receptor expression at the cell surface was reduced by replacement of Leu237 with Val, and abolished by replacement with Ala, Arg, or Asp residues. These results are consistent with molecular modeling of the TM V and VI regions of the GnRH receptor, which predicts that Leu237 is caged by several apolar amino acids (Ile233, Ile234, and Val240 in TM V, and Leu262, Leu265, and Val269 in TM VI) to form a tight hydrophobic cluster.

In pituitary gonadotrophs, the actions of GnRH are mediated by specific high affinity receptors that promote G protein-dependent stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover and calcium mobilization (3Stojilkovic S.S.

The hydropathy analysis of the GnRH receptor coding region is consistent with the seven transmembrane domain structure that is characteristic of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Mammalian GnRH receptors exhibit several unique structural features, including the absence of an intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail, reciprocal exchange of the conserved Asp and Asn residues in transmembrane domains (TM) II and VII, and replacement of Tyr with Ser in the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif located at the junction of TM III and the second intracellular loop (IL2) (3Stojilkovic S.S.

For example, we have recently demonstrated the dependence of cAMP-induced signaling from the GnRH receptor on specific residues in IL1 that are not essential for activation of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway (11Arora K.K. Krsmanovic L.Z. Mores N. O'Farrell H. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The role of IL3 in GnRH receptor function has not been examined in detail, but recent evidence has indicated its ability to couple the receptor to Gs- and Gq/11-mediated signal transduction pathways. However, this study did not identify specific amino acid residues within the loop that are functionally important for receptor-G protein coupling and selectivity (12Ulloa-Aguirre A. Stanislaus D. Arora V. Vaananen J. Brothers S. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2472-2478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the GnRH receptor has the unusual structural features mentioned above, it also contains several conserved residues and sequences in its TM helices and loops that are typical of other members of the GPCR superfamily. One of these is a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu237) located at the NH2-terminal region of IL3. This residue is positioned at a constant distance from the conserved Pro and Tyr residues in TM V (Tyr is replaced by Asn in the GnRH receptor), and is present in most of the GPCRs that are coupled to Gq/11. This suggests that Leu237 is a critical structural determinant of the specificity of receptor-G protein coupling. The location of this apolar residue in the GnRH receptor (see Fig. 1) indicates that it might play an important role in the receptor activation process. In fact, the importance of a corresponding apolar residue in the agonist-induced activation of the AT1a angiotensin receptor has been demonstrated (13Hunyady L. Zhang M. Jagadeesh G. Bor M. Balla T. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10040-10045Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Additionally, secondary structure predictions suggest that this region is an amphiphilic α-helical extension of the fifth transmembrane helix. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the NH2-terminal region of the IL3 of certain GPCRs were shown to activate the corresponding G proteins in vitro (7Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), confirming the proposed importance of this region in receptor-G protein activation. However, few of the residues that are required for receptor activation have been identified (8Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 9Hedin K.E. Duerson K. Clapham D.E. Cell Signall. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and the structural elements determining the coupling specificity of GPCRs are not well defined. Identification of specific amino acids that dictate G protein coupling is important in understanding the nature of the interaction between the receptor and its G protein(s), and the mechanisms of receptor activation, G protein specificity, and selectivity. In the present study, we assessed the role of a conserved third loop hydrophobic amino acid (Leu237) in GnRH receptor function. Leucine was replaced with residues of different characteristics, to maintain the apolarity but with different side-chain lengths, or by basic or acidic residues. The mutant GnRH receptors were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and analyzed for ligand binding, agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate production, and agonist-induced internalization of the hormone-receptor complex. Our findings indicate that the presence of the conserved apolar amino acid (Leu) in IL3 of the GnRH receptor is critical for its expression, receptor-G protein activation, and signal transduction. These results are consistent with the prediction of molecular modeling that Leu237 of the GnRH receptor is surrounded by several apolar residues forming a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster. GnRH and its superagonist analog (des-Gly10-[d-Ala6]GnRHN-ethylamide, GnRH-Ag) were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, cell-culture related products from Biofluids (Rockville, MD), and restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotide primers for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in a Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA synthesizer. The Muta-Gene phagemidin vitro mutagenesis kit (version 2), AG-1-X8 resin (100–200-mesh formate form) and Poly-Prep chromatography columns for anion exchange chromatography were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade quality.myo-[3H]Inositol (80–100 Ci/mmol) and Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kits were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.125I-Des-Gly10-[d-Ala6]GnRHN-ethylamide (125I-GnRH-Ag) was prepared by Covance Laboratories Inc. (Vienna, VA). The construction of the plasmid expressing the mouse GnRH receptor bearing a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) has been described previously (14Arora K.K. Chung H.O. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged mouse GnRH receptor was used as a template for creating site-directed mutations according to the method of Kunkelet al. (15Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using a Muta-Gene phagemid in vitromutagenesis kit. Mutations were identified using the Thermo Sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit. We have previously found that HA-tagged GnRH receptors bind the radiolabeled GnRH agonist with same affinity and elicit agonist-induced inositol phosphate response with similar EC50 as the wild-type receptor. Wild-type and mutant GnRH receptors were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. To measure inositol phosphate responses, 125I-GnRH-Ag binding to intact cells, and internalization kinetics, cultures were seeded in 24-well plates (Costar) at a density of 0.15 × 106cells/well 1 day prior to transfection. The plated cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% humidified air. Next day, the cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant plasmid DNA (1 μg/well) using FugeneTM 6 transfection reagent. The cultures were maintained for 48 h before analysis of the expressed receptors by ligand binding and functional assays. The binding affinity and abundance of the mutant receptors were determined in transfected COS-1 cells incubated with 2 nm125I-GnRH-Ag in binding medium (M199 containing 25 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide for 3–4 h at 4 °C. The cells were then rapidly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and solubilized in 0.5m NaOH, 1% SDS solution for measurement of cell-associated radioactivity by γ-spectrometry. All time studies were performed in duplicate on at least three occasions, and displacement curves were analyzed for binding affinity and capacity by the LIGAND program using a one-site model (16Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). The nonspecific binding of125I-GnRH-Ag to wild-type or mutant receptors, determined in the presence of excess unlabeled agonist (1 μm), was always less than 5% of the respective total binding. For internalization studies, transfected COS-1 cells were washed once with binding medium before the addition of 2 nm125I-labeled GnRH-Ag. After incubation at 37 °C for the indicated times, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with 1 ml of 50 mm acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl (pH 2.8) for 12 min to remove surface-bound tracer. The acid-released radioactivity was collected to determine the receptor-bound radioactivity, and the internalized (acid-resistant) radioactivity was quantitated after solubilizing the cells in NaOH/SDS solution. Radioactivities were measured by γ-spectrometry, and the internalized radioligand at each time point was expressed as a percentage of the total (acid-resistant + acid-released) binding. In addition to radioligand binding assays, an indirect ELISA protocol was used to quantify the expression of epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant GnRH receptors in the plasma membrane. COS-1 cells were seeded at a density of 90,000 cells/well in 48-well plates and transfected after 24 h with wild-type or mutant receptor cDNAs. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS three times, and treatment with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum to block nonspecific binding sites, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with a monoclonal antibody directed against the HA epitope tag (Babco, at a dilution of 1:500 in DMEM). Plates were then washed in DMEM and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution (in DMEM) of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Hydrogen peroxide (0.03%) ando-phenylenediamine (5 mm) in 0.1 mphosphate-citrate buffer (pH 5.0), serving as substrate and chromogen, respectively, were then added, and the plates were kept in the dark for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was terminated with 1 mH2SO4 containing 0.05 m Na2SO3, and the color development was measured at 495 nm using a Titertek Multiskan plate reader. COS-1 cells were labeled 24 h after transfection by incubation in inositol-free DMEM containing 20 μCi/ml [3H]inositol as described previously (17Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were washed with inositol-free M199 medium and preincubated in the same medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min at 37 °C, then stimulated with 10−10 to 10−6m GnRH for 20 min. Incubations were terminated by the addition of ice-cold perchloric acid (5% (v/v) final concentration). The inositol phosphates were extracted and separated by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (17Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and their radioactivities were measured by liquid scintillation β-spectrometry. For membrane binding experiments, cells were cultured and transfected in 100-mm cell culture dishes. After 48 h, radioligand binding was performed on the crude membrane fraction in the absence or presence of 10 μmGTPγS as described previously (17Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the bound radioactivity was measured by γ-spectrometry. Homology modeling was used to construct a model of the mouse GnRH receptor protein, employing the most recent model of the seven transmembrane helix bundle of bovine rhodopsin (18Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) as the template. The calculations were performed on an Indigo2 (IMPACT 10000) Silicon Graphics workstation equipped with program CHARMm 23.2, modeling software package LOOK (version 3.0, Molecular Applications Group, Palo Alto, CA) and Quanta (version 97, Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The modeling procedure included sequence assignment, individual helix construction, helical bundle formation, overall side-chain packing, refinement of the side-chain packing, and energy minimization (19Lin Z. Shenker A. Pearlstein R. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis studies of the known GPCRs revealed the unique patterns of conserved residues in each helix (18Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 20Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Based on these unique patterns, sequences of the seven transmembrane helices of mouse GnRH receptor were assigned. Then, each of the seven transmembrane helices was constructed from its sequence as standard α-helices using program CHARMm (version 23.2). The Pro-containing helices were built with the proline-kink conformation suggested by Sankaraamakrishnan and Vishveshwara (21Sankararamakrishnan R. Vishveshwara S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 26-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The side-chain conformations were assigned using the rotamer library of Dunbrank and Karplus (22Dunbrank R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 543-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The GnRH transmembrane helix bundle was formed by superimposing the individual helices onto the α-carbon coordinates of the bovine rhodopsin model (18Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) in LOOK. In order to obtain a structure with global minimal energy state, the self-consistent ensemble optimization method (23Lee C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 236: 918-939Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (CARA module of LOOK) was employed to pack the side chains of the mouse GnRH receptor. A starting structure was obtained and subjected to the following further refinement. When evaluated by protein health function in QUANTA, a few residues, which were typically located at the peripheral of the helical bundle, did not adapt the rotamer conformations. These side-chain conformations were re-assigned to the optimal rotamer to minimize the close contact. Furthermore, the conformations of polar residues (e.g. Asn, Asp, Tyr, Thr, Ser, etc.) were manually searched in the rotamer library of Dunbrank and Karplus (22Dunbrank R.L. Karplus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 543-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) to favor the hydrogen bond formation with their neighboring polar residues as initial structure proceeding energy minimization. Finally, the CHARMm energy minimization was performed on the helical bundle to produce the final model. The energy minimization was performed in a stepwise fashion by applying to all atoms a set of reduced harmonic force constraints to allow gradual approaching to the minimum energy structure. In each step, a maximum 300 steps of steepest descents followed by exhaustive adopted basis Newton-Raphson minimization was performed to reach an root mean square gradient of <0.01 kcal/mol·Å. To assess the role of the conserved aliphatic leucine residue at position 237 in IL3 in GnRH receptor function, five substitution mutations were created. The conserved apolar amino acid was changed to aliphatic residues (Ile, Val) to maintain the hydrophobic environment, to the apolar short side-chain residue Ala, or to charged amino acids (Arg and Asp). COS-1 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding either the wild-type or mutant GnRH receptors to compare their binding, signaling, and internalization properties. The agonist binding displacement curves for these receptors are shown in Fig. 2, and the binding parameters calculated from these data using the LIGAND program are summarized in Table I. The wild-type receptor and both of the detectably expressed mutant receptors (L237I and L237V) bound the radioligand with high affinity, and Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded linear plots consistent with a single class of GnRH-binding sites. The L237I receptor had a normal binding affinity, and that of the L237V mutant was slightly but consistently increased over that of the wild-type receptor. The B max value for L237I was similar to that of the wild-type receptor, and that of the L237V mutant was reduced by about 50% (Table I). The B max values determined by radioligand binding were in general agreement with the measurements of cell-surface expression by ELISA (Fig. 3 and Table I).Table IBinding characteristics of wild-type and Leu 237 mutant mouse GnRH receptors expressed in COS-1 cellsReceptorK dBinding sitesReceptor expression by ELISAnmpmol/mg protein% of wild-typeWild type2.3 ± 0.072.0 ± 0.31100 ± 5.0L237I2.4 ± 0.032.7 ± 0.46106 ± 7.4L237V1.4 ± 0.130.9 ± 0.1367 ± 6.3L237A——3.5 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab FIG. 3Cell-surface expression of wild-type and Leu237 mutant mouse GnRH receptors.

OD, optical density.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast, the L237A, L237R, and L237D mutants showed no radioligand binding (Fig. 2), consistent with their lack of expression at the cell surface as indicated by ELISA measurements (Fig. 3). Immunoblot analysis of lysates of cells transfected with these mutant receptors, using antibody to the HA tag, revealed the presence of GnRH receptor protein with the same size and abundance as the wild-type protein (data not shown). These findings indicate that the lack of cell surface expression of the L237A, L237R, and L237D receptors may lie at the level of receptor folding, processing, and/or targeting to the plasma membrane. The ability of the mutant receptors to couple to phospholipase C via Gq/G11 proteins was determined by measuring the inositol phosphate responses of transfected COS-1 cells stimulated with 10−10 to 10−6m GnRH in the presence of 10 mm LiCl. Under these experimental conditions, the major accumulated products of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in GnRH receptor-transfected cells are InsP2 and InsP3 (24Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The GnRH-induced InsP dose-response curves mediated by L237I and L237V receptors were similar to those of the wild-type receptor, but the EC50 values for agonist stimulation were increased by 10–20-fold (Fig. 4). EC50 values were 0.9 ± 0.22 nm for WT, 11.8 ± 0.95 nm for L237I, and 20.5 ± 6.3 nm for L237V receptors (n = 3). The L237A, L237R, and L237D mutant receptors showed no detectable inositol phosphate responses, consistent with their lack of cell-surface expression. The ability of L237I and L237V mutant receptors to interact with G proteins was further evaluated by measuring the effect of GTPγS on 125I-GnRH agonist binding to cell membranes of COS-1 cells expressing wild-type and mutant receptors. Treatment with GTPγS reduced agonist binding to the wild-type receptor by about 30%. This reduction in agonist binding was due to a decrease in the affinity of the receptor for GnRH and reflects the normal coupling of the activated receptor to G protein(s) (24Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the inhibitory effect of the GTP analog on agonist binding to the L237I and L237V receptors was relatively small (8.0 ± 1.1%, n = 3) (Fig. 5), consistent with the impaired ability of these mutants to mediate inositol phosphate production in response to GnRH stimulation (Fig. 4). The effects of mutations on agonist-induced internalization of the receptor-hormone complex were evaluated in cells expressing wild-type or mutant receptors by measuring the kinetics of125I-GnRH-Ag uptake over a period of 60 min at 37 °C (Fig. 6). A direct comparison between the wild-type and mutant receptors, made by plotting the percentage of bound tracer internalized with increasing time of incubation, showed that the cells expressing L237I and L237V receptors internalized the labeled agonist at slower rates (Fig. 6 A). The amount of tracer sequestered after 60 min was 60% of that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 6 B). These results suggested that Leu237 is not a major determinant of internalization of the GnRH receptor. The functional role of the conserved Leu237 in the amino-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of the GnRH receptor was analyzed in mutant receptors in terms of its cell-surface expression, ligand binding, agonist-induced signal transduction, and internalization. Our findings indicate that signal generation efficiency, measured by the stimulation of inositol phosphate production by GnRH, was significantly impaired in the L237I and L237V mutant receptors. In addition, the agonist-induced internalization for these receptors was reduced by 40%. The binding properties of these receptors for the GnRH agonist were largely unchanged from those of the wild-type receptor, indicating that these substitutions did not alter the integrity of the receptor. Thus, it appears that Leu237is critical for G protein coupling of the GnRH receptor and subsequent phospholipase C activation. Although substantial reductions in signal transduction efficiency were observed for the Ile237 and Val237 mutants, the partial retention of inositol phosphate signaling indicates that other regions or residues in the intracellular loops are involved in G protein activation. This was also the case for receptor internalization, which was significantly decreased but not abolished. A large body of literature on various GPCRs, recently reviewed by Wess (10Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), indicates that the IL3 loop is of critical importance for proper G protein recognition, but is not usually the sole determinant of the coupling properties of a given receptor. Rather, the IL3 appears to act in a cooperative manner with other receptor domains to permit optimum coupling and selectivity. Furthermore, the heterogeneity in amino acid sequence and size of IL3 for various GPCRs suggests that the secondary structure, rather than the primary sequence and/or the length of the loop, is important in determining G protein coupling and activation. For example, in muscarinic and catecholamine receptors, both the amino and carboxyl termini of IL3, as well as some regions within IL2, have been shown to be important in G protein binding and activation (25Okamoto T.

We have identified a natural mutation at the −30 amino acid position of the angiotensinogen signal peptide, in which an arginine is replaced by a proline (R−30P). Heterozygous individuals with R−30P showed a tendency to lowered plasma angiotensinogen level (1563 ng of ANG I/ml (range 1129–1941)) compared with normal individuals in the family (1892 ng of ANG I/ml (range 1603–2072)).

R−30P occurs in a cluster of basic residues adjacent to the first AUG codon that may affect intracellular sorting of the nascent protein. Pulse-chase experiments in transiently transfected cultured cells revealed that the R−30P mutation was associated with reduced amounts of both intra- and extracellular protein. In a cell-free system, we found that two forms of native angiotensinogen were generated by alternative initiation of translation at either AUG codon. Alteration of either the first or second AUG codons abolished the synthesis of the longer and the shorter form of native angiotensinogen, respectively. Furthermore, the rate of secretion of the shorter form was lower than that of the longer form. By transplanting angiotensinogen signal peptide onto green fluorescence protein, however, we found that both forms of the signal peptide could target green fluorescence protein, normally localized in the cytoplasm, to the secretory pathway.

The signal peptide plays an important role in translation by ribosomes; nascent protein is bound via the signal peptide to the signal recognition particle, which guides the complex to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).1 Translocation of the protein into the ER is followed by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, signal peptide cleavage, disulfide bond formation, and folding (5von Heiji G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 6Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The sequences of signal peptides are heterogeneous, but typically three conserved regions have been recognized and shown to be essential for protein export as follows: (i) an amino-terminal positively charged region, (ii) a central hydrophobic region, and (iii) a more polar carboxyl-terminal region (5von Heiji G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA of human angiotensinogen revealed the presence of a signal peptide of 33 amino acids containing all three consensus regions (7Gaillard I. Clauser E. Corvol P. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Fukamizu A. Takahashi S. Seo M.S. Tada M. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ segment of human angiotensinogen mRNA contains two AUG codons in the same reading frame. We have identified a mutation leading to the substitution of proline for arginine at the −30 amino acid position of the angiotensinogen signal peptide (R−30P). This substitution affects a cluster of basic residues, and it has been suggested that such motifs may play a direct role in the association between signal sequence and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum through electrostatic interaction with negatively charged phospholipids (9de Vrije T. de Swart R.L. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Lotteau et al. (10Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the two amino-terminal amino acid sequences of human invariant chain (Ii), a type II membrane glycoprotein, resulted from alternative initiation codons determining the intracellular localization of the protein. The two distinct forms of Ii, Ii31 and Ii33, are generated by the use of alternative initiation codons and, consequently, differ only in their amino-terminal sequence (10Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 11Strubin M. Long E.O. Mach B. Cell. 1986; 47: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ii31 was transported rapidly out of the ER after synthesis, whereas Ii33 was maintained in the ER (10Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 12Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that the amino-terminal cluster of basic residues adjacent to the first AUG codon might serve as a signal for retention of Ii33 in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this report, we investigate the functional significance of the two AUG codons and the functional impact of the R−30P mutation on angiotensinogen processing in the secretory pathway. DNA samples from patients with essential hypertension were subjected to molecular screening of the angiotensinogen gene by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. Single strand conformational polymorphism screening was performed on PCR-amplified segments spanning all five exons as well as 1 kilobase pair of the promoter region of angiotensinogen as described (1Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V. Lifton R.P. Williams C.S. Charru A. Hunt S.C. Hopkins P.N. Williams R.R. Lalouel J.-M. Corvol P. Cell. 1992; 71: 169-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). In a patient presenting a unique electrophoretic variant, individual bands were excised from the gel and subjected to direct sequencing on an ABI model 373A sequencer. Plasma level of angiotensinogen was measured by a two-step procedure in which conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by human renin was followed by measurement of angiotensin I by radioimmunoassay (13Bloem L.J. Manatunga A.K. Tewksbury D.A. Pratt J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of human angiotensinogen (provided by Dr. Nakanishi at Kyoto University, Japan) was placed under control of the major late promoter of adenovirus in the expression vector pMT2 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) (wild type-ANG/pMT2). The first or the second ATG codon was replaced by an ATC codon for ATC2-ANG/pMT2 or for ATC1-ANG/pMT2, respectively, by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar). A newly identified natural mutant, R−30P, was introduced into the same vector. These constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells (ATCC CRL1650, Rockville, MD) by electroporation with a Gene-pulsar (Bio-Rad), and pulse-chase experiments were performed as described previously (2Inoue I. Nakajima T. Williams C.S. Quackenbush J. Puryear R. Powers M. Cheng T. Ludwig E.H. Sharma A.M. Hata A. Jeunemaitre X. Lalouel J.-M. J. Clin.

Transfected cells were pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), for 10 min at 37 °C and chased for 6 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with excess methionine (20 mg/ml) and cysteine (20 mg/ml). The cells and conditioned media were collected at the time indicated. The cells were lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The lysed cells were cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. Immunoprecipitation was performed according to a standard protocol with anti-human angiotensinogen polyclonal antibody (a gift from Dr. Tewksbury at Marshfield Foundation, Marshfield, WI) (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and the signal was measured on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or exposed to Kodak x-ray film. The cDNA of human angiotensinogen was placed under the control of the T7 promoter in the pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (wild type-ANG/pBS). Three constructs were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar) as follows: (i) ATC2-ANG/pBS (the second ATG codon was changed to an ATC), (ii) ATC1-ANG/pBS (the first ATG codon was changed to an ATC), and (iii) R−30P-ANG/pBS (an arginine at the −30 position was changed to a proline). In vitrotranscription and translation reactions were performed with TNT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Translation products labeled in the presence of canine microsomal membrane (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel analysis followed by autoradiography. The radiolabeled angiotensinogen obtained through pulse-chase experiments or in vitro translation experiments was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described. Immunoprecipitated materials were dissolved in a reaction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4), and the samples were treated with endoglycosidase H, N-glycosidase F, orO-glycosidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 24 h at 37 °C. After enzyme treatment, the samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. The recombinant chimeric molecule between angiotensinogen signal peptide and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was constructed by inserting the signal sequence of the human angiotensinogen gene into the 5′ end of EGFP cDNA of the pEGFP-N13 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis in the first or second ATG codons of the angiotensinogen signal peptide was carried out by the primer-overlap method (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar). Three constructs were generated: (i) wild type-ANG/pEGFP, (ii) ATC2-ANG/pEGFP (the second ATG codon was changed to an ATC), and (iii) ATC1-ANG/pEGFP (the first ATG codon was changed to an ATC) (Fig. 4 A). COS-1 cells were transfected with angiotensinogen signal peptide/EGFP by a calcium phosphate method using modified bovine serum (Stratagene). 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice. After rinsing three times with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH) together with the monoclonal antibody against the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (BiP) (Accurate Chemicals), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescent-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus microscope IX-70 (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) with fluorescein isothiocyanate filter sets. The cells and conditioned media from transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to Western blot analysis. Samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred onto Hybond-C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20) containing 3% BSA and then incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times with TBST, antibody binding was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). While screening patients with essential hypertension, we identified a molecular variant, a G to A nucleotide substitution in exon 2 of AGT, which resulted in the replacement of arginine by proline residue at the −30 amino acid position (R−30P) in the angiotensinogen signal peptide (Fig. 1 A). We extended the molecular screening in the proband's family, of Caucasian origin, and four subjects among the seven individuals analyzed were identified as heterozygote for the mutation (Fig. 1 B). Heterozygous individuals (two were hypertensive and two were normotensive) had lower plasma angiotensinogen concentrations compared with the three normotensive non-carriers (1563 ng of ANG I/ml (range 1129–1941)versus 1892 ng of ANG I/ml (range 1603–2072)) (Fig. 1 B). Sequences encoding wild type and R−30P angiotensinogen were cloned and transiently transfected into COS-1 cells, which do not express measurable levels of angiotensinogen. Biosynthesis and secretion of recombinant angiotensinogen in COS-1 cells were examined by pulse-chase experiments. Radiolabeled angiotensinogen was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate and media with anti-human angiotensinogen antibody, analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels, and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2, A and B). Pulse-chase experiments showed that the total amount of wild type angiotensinogen (cell + medium) was unchanged during a 4-h chase. The half-life of R−30P mutant protein was considerably shorter, and the secreted amount of R−30P mutant was significantly lower than the amount of wild type (Fig. 2, A and B). Portions of the immunoprecipitates were treated with endoglycosidase H,N-glycosidase F, or O-glycosidase (Fig. 2 C). Intracellular angiotensinogen treated with endoglycosidase H showed a reduced heterogeneity in both wild type and R−30P mutant. On the other hand, secreted forms from wild type and mutant angiotensinogen were endoglycosidase H-resistant. Treatment of both cellular and secreted forms of angiotensinogen withO-glycosidase did not significantly change the molecular mass of the protein, suggesting that glycosylation of angiotensinogen is predominantly an N-linked glycosylation as demonstrated (17Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Celerier J. Lucarelli G. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We could not detect qualitative differences in the glycosylation between wild type and mutant protein. To assess the effect of the R−30P mutation on the processing of angiotensinogen in the secretory pathway in more detail, we analyzedin vitro transcription, translation, and translocation using canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. As shown in Fig. 2 D, by adding microsomal membrane, the in vitro product of angiotensinogen was processed to fuzzy heterogeneous bands showing retarded mobility in SDS-PAGE. The greater requirement of microsomal membrane fraction for the R−30P mutation compared with wild type suggested reduced efficiency of translocation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The sequence of the 5′ end of human angiotensinogen mRNA revealed the existence of two AUG codons in the same reading frame (Fig. 3 A). The first AUG codon was located 39 nucleotides from the cap site. Based on Kozak's initiation rule (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar), an initiation consensus sequence “(G/A)NNATGG” can be recognized in the sequence around the second AUG but not in the sequence around the first AUG. The regions containing signal sequences of angiotensinogen gene were compared between human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 3 B). The signal peptides are very conserved between these species; the regions spanning residue −24 to −1 particularly are highly homologous. Mouse angiotensinogen contains two in-phase AUGs, as does the human gene, but the position of the first mouse AUG is different from the human sequence. The signal peptide of rat angiotensinogen has only one AUG initiation codon. To determine if the first AUG or second AUG could function as the translation initiation site of human angiotensinogen, three constructs that contain modified AUGs were generated. Each of the constructs, (i) wild type-ANG/pBS, (ii) ATC2-ANG/pBS (the second ATG codon was changed to an ATC), and (iii) ATC1-ANG/pBS (the first ATG codon was changed to an ATC), was subjected to in vitro transcription and translation experiments (Fig. 4 A). In some cases, the experiments were performed in the presence of canine microsomal membranes as a substitute for endoplasmic reticulum to study the protein processing. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the two forms of native angiotensinogen, ANG-1 and ANG-2, were produced from wild type/pBS in the absence of microsomal membrane due to the alternative initiation of translation at either one of the two in-frame AUG codons. Mutagenesis of the first or second ATG motifs abolished the synthesis of ATC1-ANG (ANG-2) and ATC2-ANG (ANG-1), respectively (Fig. 4 B). PhosphorImager analysis showed that the ratio of ANG-1 to ANG-2 translated was approximately 5:1 when wild type-ANG/pBS was expressed. By adding microsomal membrane, four heterogeneous products (gp1, gp2, gp3, and gp4), which migrated more slowly than premature angiotensinogen on SDS-PAGE gels, were observed in all the constructs analyzed (Fig. 4 B). These four products were predicted to be the glycosylated isoforms of translocated angiotensinogen (translocated ANG), in which the signal peptide was already cleaved by signal peptidase. This was confirmed by treatment with endoglycosidase H that could remove N-linked glycosylation. After the removal ofN-linked sugar chain, the translational products from ATG-modified constructs showed the same major band (Fig. 4 C). Typically, signal peptides exhibit one or more positively charged amino acids near their amino terminus, followed by a continuous stretch of several hydrophobic residues. If translation of angiotensinogen starts from the second AUG, then the translated molecule (ANG-2) lacks the positively charged amino acids, which are considered to be important for normal processing. By using an in vitro transcription, translation, and translocation system, ANG-2 was found to be translocated normally, and N-linked glycosylation occurred with the same efficiency as ANG-1. To ascertain the in vivo processing of all three transcripts, wild type-ANG/pMT2, ATC2-ANG/pMT2, or ATC1-ANG/pMT2 were transfected into COS-1 cells, and biosynthesis and secretion of each recombinant angiotensinogen was examined by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 5 A). Immunoprecipitated angiotensinogen from cells and media was separated on SDS-PAGE gels and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Although there was no major difference in half-life or secretion amount between wild type and transcript containing only the first AUG signal, the transcript containing only the second AUG codon led to quantitative reduction in both half-life and amount of angiotensinogen protein (Fig. 5 B). To examine further the function of either form of the signal peptide, recombinant angiotensinogen signal peptide/EGFP chimeras were generated (Fig. 6 A). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with angiotensinogen signal peptide/EGFP plasmids as follows: wild type-ANG/pEGFP, ATC2-ANG/pEGFP, and ATC1-ANG/pEGFP (Fig. 6 A), and the subcellular localization of EGFP was detected by immunocytochemistry using anti-GFP antibody. The fluorescence distribution patterns of EGFP in COS-1 cells transfected with wild type-ANG/pEGFP, ATC2-ANG/pEGFP, and ATC1-ANG/pEGFP were a fine reticular network all over the cytoplasm and around the nucleus. This was suggestive of an endoplasmic reticulum staining pattern, and the localization of the signal was almost identical to that of BiP, which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 6 B, b–d) (19Sanders S.L. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13791-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, EGFP without signal peptide, as predicted, was not specifically localized to any subcellular compartment in transfected cells (Fig. 6 B, a). Western blot analysis was performed to detect EGFP secretion. COS-1 cells transfected with the chimeric constructs secreted EGFP, whereas COS-1 cells transfected with pEGFP did not secrete EGFP into the medium (Fig. 6 C). These data together with the results on full-length angiotensinogen demonstrated that both of the amino-terminal peptides of 1st and 2nd ANG are functional as signal peptide as to drive the protein to the secretory pathway. Supporting evidence is accumulating that molecular variants of angiotensinogen constitute genetic susceptibility of human essential hypertension (1Jeunemaitre X. Soubrier F. Kotelevtsev Y.V.

Invest. 1994; 93: 1285-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism mediating disease liability remains unknown. Rare variants in the gene may help in identifying the functional role of the protein in the pathogenesis of the disease. One such mutation at the renin cleavage site, L10F, was first identified in pre-eclamptic patients and caused altered kinetics in the reaction with renin (15Inoue I. Rohrwasser A. Helin C. Jeunemaitre X. Crain P. Bohlender J. Lifton R.P. Corvol P. Ward K. Lalouel J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11430-11436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a natural mutation at the −30 amino acid position of human angiotensinogen signal peptide, in which an arginine is replaced by a proline (R−30P). In the family studied, the presence of the R−30P mutation in the heterozygous state was associated with a modest decrease of plasma angiotensinogen concentration compared with control subjects in the family (Fig. 1 B). In light of the small number of family members available for study, the issue of a possible relationship between mutation and essential hypertension could not be addressed. The R−30P mutation occurs in a cluster of basic residues at the amino terminus of the signal peptide. This substitution could affect the translocation process of human angiotensinogen, as the positively charged amino-terminal region of the signal peptide has been proposed to have an important role at an initial step of translocation (20Inouye S. Soberon X. Franceschini T. Nakamura K. Itakura K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3438-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 21Vlasuk G.P. Inouye S. Ito H. Itakura K. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7141-7148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the R−30P mutation led to reduced secretion of angiotensinogen by reducing the net stability of the protein. Thus far, other signal peptide mutations have been reported that were mainly cleavage site mutations that could directly alter protein processing (22Racchi M. Watzke H.H. High K.A. Lively M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5735-5740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Few cases have indicated that natural mutations in the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide have a direct correlation with defective secretion or associated pathological states such as familial isolated hypoparathyroidism due to prepro-parathyroid hormone gene mutation (23Karaplis A.C. Lim S.K. Baba H. Arnold A. Kronenberg H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1629-1635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Crigler-Najjar type II due to bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene mutation (24Seppen J. Steenken E. Lindhout D. Bosma P.J. Elferink R.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In these cases, mutations in the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence resulted in defective signal peptide cleavage, leading to little or no secretion. In the case of the R−30P mutation, signal peptide cleavage did occur, as shown in Fig. 2, which might explain the relatively mild secretion defect. The sequence at the 5′ end of human angiotensinogen mRNA revealed two AUG codons in the same reading frame. In the present study, we show that two forms of human angiotensinogen are translated by the alternative use of either one of two in-frame AUG initiation codons in both cell-free and cellular systems. Eukaryotic mRNAs generally adhere to the first AUG rule: in most cases the AUG codon nearest the 5′ end is the unique site for initiation of translation (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4181) Google Scholar, 25Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2662-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two escape mechanisms from the first AUG rule have been considered (26Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). First, reinitiation at a downstream AUG codon may be possible when the 5′ proximal AUG codon is followed shortly by a termination codon (27Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Second, a “leaky scanning” mechanism has been reported. When the first AUG codon resides close to the cap site (within 12 nucleotides) or when the first AUG has an unfavorable context such as when the critical purine at position −3 or guanine at position +4 is absent, initiation could occur from the second AUG codon (12Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Kozak M.

In human angiotensinogen where the first AUG site contains a partial Kozak's consensus initiation sequence, position −3 is purine and +4 is C, whereas the second AUG site has a perfect Kozak's consensus initiation sequence. Leaky scanning might permit the synthesis of two forms of angiotensinogen, but we could not confirm the presence of two forms of angiotensinogen in vivo because the signal peptide is cleaved from the secretory protein while it is still growing on the ribosome. Protein targeting signals have been shown to be important both in directing proteins to and maintaining them in the target organelles or cell membrane. Typically, the signal peptide of a secretory protein has one or more positively charged amino acids near its amino terminus, followed by a continuous stretch of several hydrophobic residues (5von Heiji G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 6Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of human angiotensinogen shows that the longer form of the signal peptide has three positively charged amino acids, Arg-Lys-Arg, followed by a continuous stretch of hydrophobic residues, whereas the shorter form lacks the positively charged amino acids in the amino terminus (Fig. 1 B). The lack of basic amino acids could affect the translocation of human angiotensinogen, as the positively charged amino-terminal region of the signal peptide has been proposed to have an important role in the initial step of translocation (20Inouye S.

Human and mouse angiotensinogen have two AUG codons in the same reading frame, whereas the signal sequence of rat angiotensinogen contained only one. The region between residue −24 and −1 was highly conserved between human, mouse, and rat. Thus, it may be that the sequence following the second AUG in the human gene contains all the information necessary for secretion of angiotensinogen. Our studies show that whereas both forms of the angiotensinogen signal peptide can promote appropriate translocation both in vitroand in vivo, the additional segment present in the longer form may lead to increased efficiency of the process. That the R−30P mutation affects the net secretion rate of the protein suggests that the cluster of basic residues at the amino terminus of AGT mRNA may indeed improve the efficiency of translocation of the nascent protein. Our data, however, do not support the hypothesis that this cluster induces distinct subcellular sorting of the protein."

Glycoprotein Ia/IIa (GPIa/IIa, integrin α2β1) is a major platelet receptor for collagen. The binding site for collagen has been mapped to the I domain within the α2 subunit (GPIa). In order to assess the role of the α2-I domain structure in GPIa/IIa binding to collagen, a recombinant I domain (amino acids 126–337) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The α2-I protein bound human types I and III collagen in a saturable and divalent cation-dependent manner and was blocked by the α2β1 function blocking antibody 6F1. The α2-I protein inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation (IC50 = 600 nm). Unexpectedly, 6F1, an antibody that fails to inhibit platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma, blocked the inhibitory effect of the α2-I protein. The α2-I protein was able to prevent platelet adhesion to a collagen surface exposed to flowing blood under low shear stress. Interestingly, it inhibited platelet adhesion to extracellular matrix at high shear stress. These results, taken together, provide firm evidence that GPIa/IIa directly mediates the first contact of platelets with collagen under both stirring and flow conditions.

Platelets adhere to collagen by two mechanisms: directly by the interaction of platelet membrane proteins with collagen and indirectly via bridging molecules such as von Willebrand factor (vWF)1that bind to both platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ibα and collagen. This latter interaction is necessary to confer resistance to detachment under high flow and shear conditions. It also stabilizes platelet adhesion via the collagen receptor (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). GPIa/IIa (integrin α2β1, VLA2, CD49b/29) is member of the integrin family of heterodimeric molecules that mediate both cell-cell adhesion and adhesion between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (2Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). The integrin α2β1 is found on several different cell types, and its function may vary depending on the particular cell on which it is expressed. While it is a collagen receptor in platelets and fibroblastic cells, it functions as both a collagen and a laminin receptor on endothelial and epithelial cells (3Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl.

Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although α2β1-mediated adhesion appears to be an essential primary step in collagen-platelet interactions, it is still not known whether collagen-α2β1 binding alone is sufficient to support platelet adhesion and to induce collagen-dependent platelet activation (8 -10). Platelets from patients described as having mild bleeding disorders due to deficient expression of either the α2-integrin (11Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J.

Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 491-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated impaired aggregation in vitroin response to collagen. Antibodies against the collagen receptor GPIV (CD36) partly inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen under both static and flow conditions (15 -17). However, patients who constitutively lack CD36 have shown normal collagen-induced platelet aggregation (18Yamamoto N. Akamatsu N. Yamazaki H. Tanoue K. Br. J.

Recently, an additional collagen receptor has been cloned from human platelets (the 65-kDa protein) and expressed as a recombinant protein (21Chiang T.M. Rinaldy A. Kang A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This receptor protein binds specifically to type I collagen but not to type III collagen. The integrin α2β1 is composed of a 150-kDa α2 and a 130-kDa β1 subunit (5Bergelson J.M. Shepley M.P. Chan B.M.C. Hemler M.E. Finberg R.W. Science. 1992; 255: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Within the α2 subunit, the 200-amino acid I domain shares homology with the A domains of vWF, complement proteins, cartilage matrix protein, and certain other integrins. There is increasing evidence that I (A) domains play an important role in cell-adhesion protein and cell-matrix interactions. Like other I domains, the α2-I domain contains a cation binding site described as a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif (22Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 23Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which may explain why collagen-induced platelet adhesion and activation are dependent on divalent cations. Several studies have localized the binding site for collagen to the I domain (amino acids 140–349) of the α2 subunit. First, monoclonal antibodies that block α2β1interaction with collagen recognize epitopes located between amino acids 173 and 259 within the I domain (24Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9659-9663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a polyclonal antiserum prepared against recombinant α2-I domain inhibited endothelial cell attachment to collagen and laminin substrates (25Bahou W.F. Potter C.L. Mirza H. Blood. 1994; 84: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, some groups have expressed the α2-I domain in bacteria as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) or a maltose binding protein fusion product (26Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

Although some conflicting results have been reported, all functional studies of these expressed proteins confirmed that this region contains the binding site for collagen. To learn more about the collagen-GPIa/IIa-I domain interaction, we have cloned and expressed in bacteria the α2-I domain spanning residues 126–337. The α2-I protein was purified to homogeneity and assessed for its biological and biochemical properties. The α2-I protein bound to various types of collagen and, when incubated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Furthermore, although this protein bound to collagen by a mechanism distinct from that of vWF, it inhibited platelet adhesion to both collagen and endothelial matrix under flow conditions. Antibody 6F1 (30Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from B. Coller (Mt. Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY), antibody 12F1 (31Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluestein H.G. Woods V.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar) from V. Woods (University of California, San Diego, CA). Acid-soluble calfskin type I collagen was purchased from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). Acid-soluble human placenta type I and type III collagen were purchased from Sigma. Complementary DNA encoding the human α2 integrin subunit I domain (amino acids 126–337) was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using full-length human α2 cDNA (provided by M. E. Hemler, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) as template. The PCR end primers were designed to introduce a BamHI restriction site at the 5′ end (forward primer, 5′-AAGGCCGGATCCGATTTTCAGCTCTCA -3′) and HindIII restriction site at the 3′ end (reverse primer, 5′-AAGGCCAAGCTTACCTTCAATGCTGAA-3′). The PCR product was digested withBamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes and inserted into pQE9 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) for expression inEscherichia coli. The recombinant α2-I domain protein was expressed as a Histag fusion protein containing 12 residues at the N terminus from the expression vector (MRGSHHHHHHGS). Recombinant α2-I protein was expressed in E. coliM15(pREP4) (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Bacteria containing the pQE9-α2-I fragment were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 30 ml of 25 g/liter tryptone, 15 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.3, containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:30 and grown to anA 595 of 0.8. The culture was adjusted to 1.5 mm IPTG and incubated for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing a final concentration of 250 μg/ml lysozyme and allowed to stand for 15 min at 4 °C. The bacterial cells were lysed in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml deoxycholic acid and 70 μg/ml RNase/DNase. The lysate was centrifuged at 45,000 × gfor 25 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and passed over a Ni2+-chelated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. The α2-I protein was eluted from the column with 150 mm imidazole. The highly purified protein was dialyzed against 35 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5 (TBS-T), overnight at 4 °C. Recombinant vWF-A3 protein was prepared as described previously (32Cruz M.A. Yuan H. Lee J.R. Wise R.J. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10822-10827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli M15(pREP4) cells containing pQE9-vWF-A3 were cultured overnight at 37 °C as described above for α2-I protein. The culture was adjusted to 1.5 mm IPTG and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cells were lysed as described above. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet was washed with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10 mm EDTA, followed by recentrifugation. For purification of vWF-A3 protein, the washed pellet was solubilized by the addition of 7.5 m urea in 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, and the solubilized protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2. The solubilized protein was passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted from the column with sodium chloride. The purified vWF-A3 protein was dialyzed against TBS. E. coli were grown overnight and diluted in the medium described above. When grown to A 595 = 0.8, the cells (800 ml) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with M9 minimal medium (12.8 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% glucose, 2 mg/liter thiamine), and pelleted again. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 150 mg/liter amounts of each of the following amino acids: threonine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, valine, and proline. Bacteria were grown for 60 min, IPTG was added, and the medium was supplemented with 2 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (NEN Life Science Products) overnight at 37 °C. Labeled α2-I protein was purified as described above. The specific activity of the purified35S-α2-I protein was determined to 2.4 × 104 cpm/μg. A final concentration of either 500 or 10 μg/ml collagen or a 1% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to microtiter wells in 65 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, to remove unadsorbed collagen, residual binding sites were blocked by the addition of 3% BSA in TBS-T for 60 min at 37 °C. Varying concentrations of the α2-I protein were added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Wells were then washed with TBS-T and the remaining bound α2-I detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Wells were incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C. The wells were again washed and the substrate (o-phenylenediamine, Sigma) was added. After 30 min of substrate conversion, reactions were stopped with 0.025 ml of 2n H2SO4, and the plates were read at 490 nm. Net specific binding was determined by subtracting optical density values from wells coated only with BSA from the total binding values obtained as described above. Collagen-binding assays in the presence of EDTA or divalent cations were carried out with 35S-labeled α2-I protein (500 nm) and EDTA, MgCl2, or CaCl2 (2 mm). After a 60-min incubation, the wells were washed and separated for scintillation counting. For the antibody-blocking assay, 35S-labeled α2-I protein (500 nm ) was preincubated with anti-human α2 antibodies 6F1 or 12F1 (1.5 μm) for 30 min and added to the wells. After 60 min, the wells were washed and removed for scintillation counting. For competition assays, a constant concentration of plasma (diluted 1:40 in TBS) was added to the wells with increasing concentrations of α2-I protein or vWF-A3 protein. Wells were washed with TBS-T and anti-vWF-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:500; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The bound antibody was detected as described above. Blood was collected from a healthy donor into a tube containing 3.8% sodium citrate. PRP was prepared by centrifuging the blood at 250 ×g for 10 min. Platelet aggregation was carried out in siliconized glass cuvettes at 37 °C with constant stirring at 1200 rpm in a four-channel aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp., Horsham, PA). PRP was diluted to a platelet concentration of 1.5 or 2 × 108/ml in TBS and incubated with varying concentrations of α2-I protein at 37 °C for 5 min. Aggregation was initiated by the addition of 5 μg/ml soluble equine tendon collagen (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Equine tendon collagen was diluted to 5 μg/ml with 20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 5.0, and added to 35-mm culture dishes. After 1 h incubation at 37 °C, coated dishes were subsequently rinsed and incubated with TBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C to block nonspecific interactions. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in growth medium 199 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotech, Ft. Collins, CO), 2 mml-glutamine, 60 units/ml penicillin, 60 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 mg/ml endothelial mitogen (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), and 100 mg/ml tissue culture grade heparin (Sigma). The cells were grown on sterile 35-mm dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) for 4 days to reach confluence in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The cells were detached by incubation for 20 min at room temperature with 5 mm EDTA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The extracellular matrix deposited on the dishes was washed repeatedly with phosphate-buffered saline. For functional inhibition of the platelet collagen receptor GPIa/IIa, 4 μm α2-I protein was added to the coated dishes and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then used immediately in blood perfusion studies as described below. A parallel plate flow chamber was assembled as described by the manufacturer (Glycotech, Rockville, MD). Briefly, the collagen-coated dish formed the lower surface of the chamber and a silicone rubber gasket determined the flow path height of 254 μm. The flow chamber was assembled and filled with TBS. A syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA) was used to aspirate blood through the flow chamber. Using different gasket thicknesses, flow rates of 0.48 and 0.6 ml/min produced a wall shear rate of 150 s−1 and 1500 s−1, respectively. Blood was collected from healthy adult donors into syringes containing 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Blood was then perfused for 3 min, and the coated dish was washed with TBS. Attached platelets were observed with phase contrast objectives and recorded by videomicroscopy. For the inhibition experiments, the collagen or subendothelial matrix surface were incubated with α2-I protein (4 μm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Blood was incubated with α2-I protein (4 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C. All experiments were performed in duplicate on different days. After induction with IPTG, bacteria transformed with the plasmid pQE9-α2-I and expressing α2-I cDNA were lysed. The resultant bacterial lysate was then passed over a Ni2+-column and the bound protein eluted with a step imidazole gradient. The final yield of purified protein was 10 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The calculated molecular mass for the sequence between Asp-126 and Gly-337 is 23,207 Da. The 12 additional amino acids from the vector sequence add another 1613 Da, bringing the total estimated molecular mass to 24,820 Da. This is in good agreement with the estimated molecular mass of the purified material of 27,000 Da (Fig. 1, inset) as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified α2-I protein was evaluated for its ability to bind directly to collagen. As shown in Fig. 1, the α2-I protein bound to calf skin and human type I and III collagen in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. The half-maximal binding to the three types of collagen occurred at 650 nm (Fig. 1). It has been reported that the binding of integrin α2β1 to collagen is a Mg2+-dependent process. To confirm the dependence on divalent cation in α2-I domain/collagen interactions, we examined the extent of collagen binding in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, and EDTA. Since EDTA impaired the interaction of the anti-polyhistidine-HRP monoclonal antibody with the His tag motif, we expressed and purified metabolically labeled 35S-α2-I protein. Consistent with previous reports, 35S-α2-I protein binding to collagen type I was greatly reduced by the addition of 2 mm EDTA (Fig. 2). More detailed studies of the divalent cation dependence of the35S-α2-I protein/collagen interaction were then undertaken. It was observed that the addition of Mg2+(2 mm) supported binding while Ca2+ (2 mm) only supported low levels of interaction. These results confirmed the integrity of the MIDAS motif in the35S-α2-I protein. Inhibition of platelet GPIa/IIa binding to collagen by α2-I protein was assessed in two ways. As shown in Fig. 3, we studied the effect of α2-I protein on collagen-induced platelet aggregation (CIPA). α2-I protein inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 600 nm. At a sufficiently high concentration of α2-I protein (2 μm), CIPA was completely inhibited. We also examined the effect of the α2-I protein on platelet interactions with collagen or subendothelial matrix under shear stress. α2-I protein (4 μm) prevented platelet adhesion to collagen fibrils exposed to whole blood at shear rate of 150 s−1 (Fig. 4 A). At higher shear rates (1500 s−1), the protein failed to inhibit this interaction (data not shown). However, the α2-I protein (4 μm) inhibited platelet adhesion to subendothelial matrix at a shear rate of 1500 s−1 (Fig. 4 B). These data confirmed the important role of α2β1in platelet activation (aggregation) and platelet adhesion under flow conditions.FIG. 4Inhibition by α2-I protein of platelet adhesion to collagen or subendothelial matrix under shear stress. A, platelets adherent to dishes coated with collagen fibrils are seen as bright patches under phase contrast frames in the controlupper panel (−). Collagen-coated dishes were then incubated with α2-I protein (4 μm). Whole blood containing the same concentration of the α2-I protein was perfused through the chamber at 150 s−1. As seen in the lower panel (+), few platelets attached to collagen fibrils. B, upper panel(−), platelet attachment after whole blood was perfused over subendothelial matrix shear rate of 1500 s−1.Lower panel (+), platelet attachment was reduced after perfusion with whole blood containing 4 μmα2-I protein over a surface of subendothelial matrix previously incubated with α2-I protein (4 μm). Figure is representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since vWF binds to collagen via the vWF-A3 domain, which possesses a similar three-dimensional structure to α2-I domain, we next examined the ability of the α2-I protein to block the binding of multimeric vWF to collagen. Inhibition of the binding of multimeric vWF to immobilized collagen by α2-I and vWF-A3 proteins is shown in Fig. 5. Both I (A) domain proteins compete with vWF for binding to collagen, but with varying affinities. The IC50 for vWF-A3 protein was 1.0 μm while that for the α2-I protein was 10.2 μm. The anti-human α2 integrin monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1 were tested for their effects on the collagen binding activity of α2-I protein in two ways. Antibody 6F1, which inhibits the binding of intact α2β1 integrin to collagen (30Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also effectively blocked the binding of the α2-I protein to type I collagen (Fig. 6 A). Surprisingly, 12F1, an antibody that does not inhibit the binding of the intact integrin α2β1 to collagen (31Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluestein H.G. Woods V.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited 50% of the binding of the α2-I protein to collagen. We also studied the effect of the monoclonal antibodies on the α2-I protein in the CIPA assay. As expected, neither 6F1 nor 12F1 antibody inhibited platelet aggregation in PRP. However, they were able to block the inhibitory effect of the α2-I protein in the CIPA assay (Fig. 6 B). Among the platelet membrane proteins proposed as mediators of platelet adhesion to collagen, GPIa/IIa (integrin α2β1) is considered the major collagen receptor. The I domain present in the α2 chain (GPIa) contains the collagen binding site (24Kamata T. Puzon W. Takada Y. J. Biol.

To further our knowledge of α2 subunit structure and function, we have expressed a protein encompassing the α2-I domain (amino acids126–337) in E. coli. This recombinant protein 1) can be readily purified in a soluble form from bacteria, 2) binds specifically to collagen, 3) inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation, 4) blocks platelet interaction with collagen or ECM under flow conditions, and 5) inhibits the binding of the multimeric vWF to collagen with a lower affinity than the vWF-A3 protein. Furthermore, its collagen binding ability is blocked by the anti-human α2-integrin monoclonal antibodies 6F1 and 12F1. Other investigators have used different expression systems to produce α2-I domain fragments in E. coli. In their methods, they have used sonication (26Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to solubilize their recombinant proteins. In contrast, our α2-I protein was purified from the cytoplasmic soluble fraction of enzymatically disrupted bacterial membranes by single-step Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Also of note are the further manipulations to which some groups subjected their recombinant proteins, such as biotinylation or iodination, in order to permit subsequent detection. However, in this study, we expressed and purified metabolically labeled α2-I protein. We believe that the solubility of our recombinant protein is related to the short fusion protein (12 amino acids) coded for in the expression vector and that minimal processing of the purified protein results in a superior starting material for biochemical analysis. Among the four recombinant α2-I domain expressed and characterized to date, distinctions exist among them with respect to the particular sequence selected for expression, purity of the final product, biophysical properties, and the methods used to functionally analyze the recombinant proteins. However, our results agree, in general, with the previously published observations. The half-maximal binding values reported by three of the previous studies has been calculated using ELISA for protein quantitation. Using similar methods, our value of 650 nm for the three types of collagen used is in good agreement with the range of half-maximal binding concentrations reported previously (400 nm to 1.3 μm) (27Tuckwell D. Calderwood D.A. Green L.J. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1629-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 981-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we are the first group to analyze the binding of the isolated α2-I domain to type III collagen. Our results are in agreement with the work of Saelman et al. (33Saelman E.U.M. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G. Heijnen H.F.G. Sage E.H. Williams S. McKeown L. Gralnick H.R. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who demonstrated the interaction of platelets (via GPIa/IIa) with type III collagen. In one of the four previous studies, Kamata et al. (26Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the binding of125I-GST-α2-I protein to collagen with a half-maximal binding of 500 nm. In our study, utilizing purified metabolically labeled 35S-α2-I protein, we obtained a half-maximal binding of 200 nm (data not shown). Our α2-I protein bound to collagen in a similar manner to the intact integrin α2β1. In this respect, the present study extends the observations of three previously published reports that Mg2+ sustained, while EDTA or Ca2+ inhibited the binding of α2-I protein to collagen. On the other hand, our findings contrast with those of Kamataet al. (26Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that recombinant125I-GST-α2-I domain bound to collagen in a metal-independent manner. It is possible that this discrepancy is an artifactual consequence of the iodination procedure since we could demonstrate the metal dependence using intrinsically labeled35S-α2-I protein. The results of our binding studies support the conclusion that the MIDAS motif in the I domain plays an important role in the collagen binding activity of the α2-I domain. It has been reported that collagen failed to induce platelet aggregation on either integrin α2β1-deficient platelets or in the presence of anti-integrin α2β1 antibody. In this study, the α2-I protein effectively inhibited platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent fashion. Although the IC50 calculated from our data agrees with a report by Depraetere et al. (29Depraetere H. Wille C. Gansemans Y. Stanssens P. Lauwereys M. Baruch D. De Reys S. Deckmyn H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 981-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our study is the first to examine the inhibitory effect of the α2-I protein using PRP. This approach has provided an interesting new insight in that the 6F1 antibody blocked the inhibitory capacity of the α2-I protein. As shown in this study, and in agreement with Coller et al. (30Coller B.S. Beer J.H. Scudder L.E. Steinberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 182-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Kunicki et al. (34Kunicki T.J. Orchekowski R. Annis D. Honda Y. Blood. 1993; 82: 2693-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while 6F1 inhibits CIPA with gel-filtered platelets, 6F1 does not prevent platelet aggregation in PRP. It is of interest that washed platelets were used to produce this antibody. Thus, the discordant 6F1 results might be explained by a continued exposure of the collagen-binding site while a conformational change occurs in the α2-I domain during platelet preparation. Another possibility is that the epitope recognized by the antibody could be blocked by a plasma component that is removed by gel filtration. Our study is also one of the first to analyze simultaneously the interaction between GPIa and collagen under flow conditions using a soluble, high affinity receptor fragment as a ligand. It is known that, at high shear stress, binding of plasma vWF to collagen or ECM and subsequent platelet GPIb binding to bound vWF is required for initial platelet adhesion (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 35Wu Y.P. van Breugel H.H.F.I. Lankhof H. Wise R.J,. Handin R.I. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we observed that integrin α2β1 was critical for platelet attachment to subendothelial matrix at high shear rates. This observation agreed with a recent study that used a monoclonal antibody against integrin α2β1 and reported a relatively modest inhibition of platelet attachment to ECM (1Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Deposited ECM contains vWF, collagen, and other components that may participate in matrix-platelet interactions (36Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was surprising to find that endogenous subendothelial vWF and plasma vWF were not sufficient to support platelet adhesion to ECM. Competition between vWF and the α2-I domain for collagen binding sites is unlikely since in this study we demonstrated that they bind to collagen by different mechanisms. One explanation could be that these cells synthesized a small amount of either endogenous vWF or collagen. Therefore, the consequence would be a limited availability of binding sites for the platelet GPIb/IX/V complex or for plasma vWF, respectively. On the other hand, our data support previous reports that platelet adhesion to collagen fibrils at low shear stress is integrin α2β1-dependent (33Saelman E.U.M. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. de Groot P.G. Heijnen H.F.G. Sage E.H. Williams S. McKeown L. Gralnick H.R. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Verkleij M.W. Morton L.F. Knight C.G. de Groot P.G. Barnes M.J. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 3808-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with endogenous subendothelial collagen, immobilized isolated collagen fibrils are assembled by raising the pH of a solution and the lack of other subendothelial components may contribute to the formation of an alternative collagen structure. Then, at high shear stress, this conformational change may affect the basic properties of the triple-helical structure resulting in a low affinity by the α2-I domain for the binding sites in collagen. Further interesting results were obtained with the non-function blocking antibody, 12F1 (31Pischel K.D. Hemler M.E. Huang C. Bluestein H.G. Woods V.L. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 226-233PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports by Kamataet al. (26Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Dickeson et al. (28Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we found that 12F1 blocked the α2-I protein binding to collagen in CIPA. As discussed above, the fact that 6F1 does not bind to GPIa in PRP, but binds to the isolated I domain, suggests that the epitope recognized by the antibody in the I domain of the GPIa/IIa complex may have a different conformation or may be cryptic in the intact receptor. Therefore, one possibility is that, although the collagen binding remains normal, the recombinant I domain acquired a different conformation. It may be also possible that binding of antibody 12F1 to our α2-I protein destroys the integrity of the MIDAS motif (which is essential for collagen binding) rather than simply blocking sterically. Integrin α2β1, GPIV (CD36), and GPVI have all been implicated in platelet-collagen adhesive interactions. It has been suggested that the collagen receptor GPIV is an important mediator of platelet adhesion to collagen (16Tandon N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nakamura T. Jamieson G.A. Okuma M. Kambayashi J. Tandon N.N. J. Biol.

Haematol. 1996; 92: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) while the receptor GPVI seems to play an important role in collagen-mediated signaling events (8Ichinohe T. Takayama H. Ezumi Y.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11897-11903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our findings strongly suggest that among these collagen receptors, the integrin α2β1 is a necessary complement to the vWF-GPIb interaction for the initial tethering of platelets to collagen or ECM. Our results may also explain the occurrence of bleeding in patients with genetic defects on α2β1 (11Nieuwenhuis H.K. Akkerman J.W. Houdijk W.P. Sixma J.J. Nature. 1985; 318: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thus, while there is little doubt that the α2-I domain is essential for the binding of platelet integrin α2β1 (GPIa/IIa) to collagen, it is possible that other regions of α2 subunit may mediate collagen binding (28Dickeson S.K. Walsh J.J. Santoro S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7661-7668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The techniques described here for the expression, purification, and the biochemical analysis of recombinant α2-I domain can be employed in future studies to analyze the different ligand specificities of the integrin α2β1 expressed in other cell types. The biological properties of this soluble receptor fragment should provide an interesting model system to design agents that can selectively inhibit shear-dependent platelet adhesion to vascular subendothelium. These results strongly suggest that platelet GPIa/IIa is the major collagen receptor and that the isolated α2-I protein is a promising inhibitor of the platelet-collagen interaction.

The T4 gene 44 protein (35.8 kDa) has sequence homologies with CLC subunits from other organisms, but gp62 (21.4 kDa) is a unique protein, possessing no significant sequence homology to known proteins. The in vivo function of the CLC is to chaperone the sliding clamp to the DNA primer-template junction (9Kaboord B.F. Benkovic S.J. Curr.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The CLC then initiates a conformational change in the toroidal gp45 that results in deposition of the sliding clamp around double-stranded DNA (11Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12709-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting complex has interprotein contacts so tight that, despite the lack of disulfide bonds between subunits, dissociation is only observed under denaturing conditions (21Barry J. Alberts B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2717-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Morris C.F. Hama-Inaba H. Mace D. Sinha N.K. Alberts B. J. Biol.

The mechanism by which the stoichiometry is maintained and the nearly covalent subunit interactions develop is unknown. Genes 44and 62 are adjacent to each other on the T4 genome, are cotranscribed as part of a polycistronic mRNA (24Hsu T. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5303-5316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are translationally coupled (25Karam J. Bowles M. Leach M. Virology. 1979; 94: 192-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Torgov M.Y. Janzen D.M. Reddy M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A model of translational capture (Fig. 1, lower path) has been proposed for assembly of the CLC, where gp62 folds on a preformed scaffold composed of gp44 tetramers. This model predicts that assembly of a functional CLC absolutely requires that the subunits co-fold (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yeh L.S. Hsu T. Karam J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gerald W.L. Karam J.D. Genetics. 1984; 107: 537-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translational capture model was developed considering 1) the tight translational coupling of the 44 and 62gene expression and 2) the strong intersubunit contacts that develop during complex assembly. Recent studies have shown that the CLC assembles when its subunits are co-expressed in trans, proving that translational coupling does not contribute to the formation of the CLC (34Janzen D.M. Torgov M.Y. Abbott S.N. Reddy M.K. Virology. 1999; 260: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that the CLC is capable of self-assembly (Fig. 1, upper path). If purified native subunits are combined, the self-assembly model predicts the formation of active CLC, whereas the translational capture model predicts that a denaturing agent followed by refolding of one or all subunits would be necessary for assembly of active CLC. The gp44 protein has been individually purified and found to assemble into a higher order complex with a molecular weight indicating probable tetramer formation (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally hypothesized that the CLC would assemble poorly from pre-folded subunits (21Barry J. Alberts B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2717-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CLC possesses a low intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity (30Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located in the gp44 subunits (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Spicer E.K. Nossal N.G. Williams K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15425-15432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of the CLC is enhanced by the presence of DNA or by the presence of the cognate sliding clamp gp45. In the presence of both gp45 and DNA, the ATP hydrolysis activity of the CLC displays a synergistic stimulation (30Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Mace D.C. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). An ATP hydrolysis activity, with a magnitude greater than that of the CLC, was demonstrated for the isolated gp44 tetramers in the presence of DNA. However, stimulation of gp44 tetramers by gp45 was greatly reduced when compared with CLC (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was surmised that the gp62 subunits constrains the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of gp44 and mediates its interaction with gp45. In this study we demonstrate the purification of gp62 subunits expressed in E. coli. The isoelectric points of individual subunits and the CLC were determined. Through chromatographic, electrophoretic, and immunologic techniques, the occurrence of anin vitro physical interaction was observed between purified gp44 and gp62 subunits. A CLC was reconstituted that displayed the signature patterns of the ATPase functions of native gp44/62, supporting the self-assembly model of CLC formation.

The arabinose-inducible expression vectors as well as E. colistrain LMG194 (F− ΔlacX74 galE galK thi rpsLΔphoA (PvuII) Δara714 leu::Tn10) (33Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar) were donated by the laboratory of J. Beckwith (Harvard University). Construction of plasmids pCLC44 and pCLC62S, which express the gene 44 and gene 62 clamp loader subunits, respectively, were described in Janzen et al. (34Janzen D.M. Torgov M.Y. Abbott S.N. Reddy M.K. Virology. 1999; 260: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Construction of pCLC62H+and pCLC62H− is described in the next section. LMG194 transformed with either pCLC44 or any one of the pCLC62 constructs was grown in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, with shaking at 200 rpm to an A 600 of approximately 1.0. Cells used for gp44 purification were grown at 37 °C, then inducted with 0.2% arabinose for 1 h. Cells used for gp62 purification were grown at 30 °C, induced for 20 min by the addition of 0.2% arabinose, then quenched by pouring the media over ice. Cells were harvested by a 10-min centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C. Expression of gp62 constructs was measured using the method described in Torgov et al. (26Torgov M.Y. Janzen D.M. Reddy M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T4 gene62 constructs were amplified from the plasmid pTL151WX (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by the polymerase chain reaction using Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The forward (sense) primer, which preserved the putative hairpin (H+), had the sequence 5′-GGCGAAAATAATCAGTATCATGG-3′. The forward primer used for deletion of the hairpin (H−) was 5′-GCAAATGCAGTGG-3′. The same reverse (antisense) primer was used in both constructs and consisted of the sequence 5′-TTACCATTCCAATGCTAGTTTTTTG-3′. For the H+ and H− constructs, gene 62 was amplified with the listed primers. The fragments were gel-purified, 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cloned into theSmaI site of pBAD18, yielding either pCLC62H+ or pCLC62H−. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). A protease inhibitor mixture tablet was dissolved in 20 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm MOPS pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol), and the solution was used to resuspend a frozen cell pellet from 3.2 liters of induced cells. Two mg of lysozyme dissolved in 1 ml of lysis buffer was added, and the suspension was incubated on ice for 1–1.5 h with stirring. Cells were ruptured by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in a dry ice/ethanol bath, then 300 μl of 2 mg/ml DNase I in 0.3m CaCl3 and 300 μl of 1.0 mMgCl2 were added. The suspension was incubated on ice with stirring for an additional h. The solution was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 20 min, and the supernatant was reserved. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer and recentrifuged. The two supernatants were combined, and ultracentrifuged at 4 °C for 2 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor. The supernatant was filter-sterilized through a 0.2-μm membrane and termed the cleared lysate. The cleared lysate was applied to a 20-ml bed volume DEAE column equilibrated in 12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol. The flow-through fraction was collected and applied to a 5-ml prepacked sulfonic acid column equilibrated in S buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). Protein was eluted from the column with a 20-bed-volume linear gradient from 0 to 750 mm NaCl in S buffer. Gp62 eluted at approximately 500 mm NaCl, and fractions containing gp62 were pooled and diluted 5-fold with S buffer. The diluted fractions were applied to a 5-ml prepacked hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in S buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The column was developed with a 25-bed-volume linear gradient from 0 to 100% phosphate buffer (150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). Gp62 eluted at 50 mm phosphate. The fractions containing gp62 were pooled, and their volume was doubled by the addition of 3.0m ammonium sulfate. The diluted fractions were applied to a 1-ml prepacked hydrophobic interaction column equilibrated with a solution of 2.0 mammonium sulfate in HIC buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). A 30-bed-volume linear gradient from 2.0 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in HIC buffer was applied to the column. Gp62 eluted near the end of the gradient, at approximately 200 mm ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing gp62 were pooled, concentrated in a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff ultrafiltration tube, and dialyzed into storage buffer (30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol). Purified gp44/62 (60 μg), gp44 (55 μg), or gp44 (55 μg) and gp62 (6 μg) were suspended in a total volume of 250 μl of DE buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and incubated for 1 h at 15 °C. Protein solutions were applied to a 1-ml DEAE column equilibrated in DE buffer, and the flow-through was collected. Elution was with 400 mmNaCl in DE buffer. Equal volumes of flow-through and eluent were acetone-precipitated and analyzed. The relative amounts of gp44 per lane were compared by scanning stained bands on a ColorOne scanner (Apple) set on 600 dots/inch resolution in the gray-scale mode. The scanned images were quantified as described in Torgov et al. (26Torgov M.Y. Janzen D.M. Reddy M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified gp44 and gp62 were mixed at a ratio of 2 gp62 subunits/gp44 tetramer in reconstitution buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Aliquots of the reconstitution mixture were mixed with an excess of isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample buffer (12.5% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% pH 3/10 ampholytes, 1.0% pH 8/10 ampholytes, and 0.6% pH 9/11 ampholytes). Aliquots were loaded on first-dimension isoelectric focusing gels (0.8% agarose, 2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 5% sorbitol, and ampholytes of the desired pH range mixture at a final concentration of 2%) and run for 1600 V-h. The catholyte and anolyte were 40 mm NaOH and 20 mm HEPES, respectively. To determine a pH profile, two or three typical first-dimension gels were cut into 3-mm sections. Each section was macerated in 20 μl of deionized water, and the pH of the resulting solution was measured. First-dimension gels were equilibrated for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (36O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and placed into the well of a second-dimension gel. Second-dimension gels were silver-stained or electroblotted and subjected to detection by chemiluminescence. Blots were usually cut in half and processed separately for gp44 (top half) and gp62 (bottom half). Purified gp44/62 (15 μg), gp44 (13 μg), gp62 (2 μg), or gp44 (13 μg) and gp62 (2 μg) was suspended in 100 μl of reconstitution buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm ATP, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol) and incubated for 1 h at 15 °C. Then 900 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2% Nonidet P-40) and 6 μg of anti-gp62 antibody were added to each sample. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with inversion. Washed Dynal sheep anti-rabbit IgG-coated magnetic beads(100 μl) were added to each sample, and incubation was continued for another h. Each sample was washed three times with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40 and three times with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.0m NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Precipitated proteins were eluted by inversion for 40 min with 20 μl of sodium citrate pH 2.5. ATPase assays were performed using a pyruvate kinase and lactic acid dehydrogenase-coupled enzyme system as described in Janzen (34Janzen D.M. Torgov M.Y. Abbott S.N. Reddy M.K. Virology. 1999; 260: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) using 250 nm gp44/62, 250 nmgp44 tetramers, or 250 nm each gp44 tetramers and gp62 monomers. When titrations of gp62 into gp44 were performed, 250 nm gp44 tetramers was used with either 0, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 187.5, 250, 325, or 500 nm gp62 subunits. Preincubation of gp44 and gp62 subunits before assaying for activity was found to have no effect upon the ATPase rate obtained. Expression vectors for the individual subunits of the CLC were constructed utilizing arabinose-inducible vectors of the pBAD series (33Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar). Constructs were used to transform a strain of E. coli (LMG194) that cannot metabolize arabinose. The T4 gene 44 was cloned into pBAD24 to yield pCLC44 (34Janzen D.M. Torgov M.Y. Abbott S.N. Reddy M.K. Virology. 1999; 260: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). E. coli harboring the plasmid pCLC44 could be induced to produce large amounts of soluble gp44. The gp44 subunits were purified to >95% homogeneity (data not shown) using the method of Rush et al. (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translation of gene 62 is coupled to translation of the upstream gene 44, either by sequestration of the gene62 translation initiation region (TIR) in a hairpin structure or through a naturally weak TIR. Reported attempts at expression of gene 62 required maintenance of a portion of the upstream reading frame for gp62 synthesis (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, synthesis of gp62 has been observed in the absence of translational coupling via Western blotting techniques (26Torgov M.Y. Janzen D.M. Reddy M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4339-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To optimize expression of gene62 we tested different configurations for the TIR of gene62. The first construct has the exact sequence of gene62 from 97 nucleotides upstream of the start codon to the stop codon amplified directly from the natural sequence and cloned into the medium copy number, ampicillin-resistant plasmid pBAD18 to yield pCLC62H+ (H+ ≡ putative hairpin preserved). Expression from this construct was taken as the basal level. A second construct was designed that disrupted the proposed secondary structure around the gene 62 TIR. The sequence from 20 nucleotides upstream of the gene 62 start codon to the stop codon was amplified and cloned into pBAD18 resulting in pCLC62H−(H− ≡ putative hairpin disrupted). Surprisingly, the construct with the deletion in the hairpin exhibited a 4-fold lower amount of expression than the basal level (Fig. 2). The Shine-Dalgarno region for gene62 is weak by comparison to the consensus. To increase the efficiency of translation initiation, an optimized Shine-Dalgarno region was placed 5 nucleotides upstream of the gene 62start codon. This construct was cloned into pBAD18 to yield pCLC62S (S ≡ synthetic). Maximum amounts of gp62 expression were observed with the pCLC62S vector, levels more than 12-fold higher than basal expression. These results suggest that a weak TIR is the important determinant for coupling of gene 62 translation to that of gene 44. The results also imply that the putative hairpin may not actually form in vivo. The construct pCLC62S was used as a source for all gp62 purification attempts. Although induction of pCLC62S enabled us to produce significant amounts of gp62, we found that solubility of the protein was limited. Solubility decreased as temperature increased, leading to sequestration of gp62 in inclusion bodies (34Janzen D.M. Torgov M.Y. Abbott S.N. Reddy M.K. Virology. 1999; 260: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thus a short induction period at low temperature (30 °C) was chosen for expression of gp62 to minimize formation of inclusion bodies. Induced cells were lysed, and the soluble fraction was subjected to the following chromatographic steps: DEAE, sulfonic acid, hydroxylapatite, and hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 3). The protocol yielded approximately 70 μg of gp62/liter of cells induced. Anion exchange chromatography demonstrated a change in the binding character of the gp44 subunit. When DEAE chromatography was performed at pH 7.9, 95% of the individual gp44 subunits bound to the media, whereas 95% of the intact CLC was found in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 4). The clamp loader subunits were incubated together at a ratio of 0.75 gp62 subunits/gp44 tetramer and applied to the DEAE column. A decrease in the proportion of gp44 that bound to the column was observed, with nearly 50% of the gp44 subunits appearing in the flow-through (Fig. 4). A similar shift in gp62 elution position could be observed using cation exchange chromatography (result not shown). IEF and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis also give evidence forin vitro reconstitution of the CLC. When intact CLC is subjected to IEF in the presence of 1.5% CHAPS (dissociating conditions), gp44 and gp62 migrated as separate subunits (Fig. 5 A). The gp44 subunit exhibited an isoelectric point of 6.7, whereas gp62 migrated with a pI of 9.4. Individual subunits, when run separately in the presence or absence of CHAPS, migrated with similar isoelectric points (result not shown). The pIs determined for the gp44 and gp62 subunits agree with predicted values (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the CLC was subjected to IEF in the absence of CHAPS (native conditions), the subunits migrated with identical pIs of 8.4 (Fig. 5 B). This value is similar to the experimentally determined value for CLC (21Barry J. Alberts B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2717-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Gp44 and gp62 subunits were mixed, then run under IEF native conditions. The majority of both subunits migrated as a complex (Fig. 5 C). IEF gives evidence that the reconstituted complex is stable, since once dissociated, the subunits would migrate at their individual pIs. Immunoprecipitation was also used to investigate the in vitro reconstitution of the CLC. In the presence of 0.6 mm magnesium polyclonal antibody against the CLC efficiently precipitated individual gp44 or gp62 subunits. Under the same conditions, the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of intact CLC was significantly and reproducibly reduced (Fig. 6, three left lanes). When the gp44 and gp62 subunits were incubated together before immunoprecipitation, neither subunit precipitated efficiently, a pattern indicative of complex formation (Fig. 6, right lane). The reduction in immunoprecipitation of the CLC compared with that of individual subunits could be due to sequestration of epitopes upon complex formation or to conformational changes altering epitopes after complex assembly. The CLC possesses an intrinsic ATPase activity that resides in the gp44 subunits; however, the ATPase activity of purified gp44 subunits differs from that of intact CLC. The ATP hydrolysis activity of gp44 subunits is known to exhibit a higher rate of hydrolysis than the CLC in the presence of DNA (27Rush J. Lin T.C. Quinones M. Spicer E.K. Douglas I. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10943-10953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results found with our gp44 preparation matched this expectation (Table I). Similar to CLC behavior (30Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mace D.C. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the gp44 subunits did not exhibit cooperative behavior with respect to either ATP or DNA binding, as evidenced by the ATP hydrolysis activity exhibiting Michaelis-Menten kinetics (result not shown). Our purified gp44 subunits possessed aK m for ATP of 190 ± 20 μm in the presence of DNA. This value resembles the K m for ATP reported for CLC under similar condition, 260 ± 40 μm (30Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 125 ± 16 μm (15Berdis A.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9253-9265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TheK m for DNA was similar for gp44 and CLC, approximately 500 μmnuc DNA with double-stranded character (30Jarvis T.C. Paul L.S. Hockensmith J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12717-12729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The greatest difference between the ATPase activities of gp44 and CLC was the response to the sliding clamp (gp45). The ATPase activity of the CLC exhibited stimulation in the presence of gp45 that is similar to that observed when DNA is present. When both cofactors are present, the stimulation of the CLC was synergistic. However, gp44 exhibits little to no stimulation in the presence of gp45, and there is no synergistic stimulation observed when both gp45 and DNA cofactors are present.Table IATP hydrolysis ratesEnzyme preparationCofactorNonegp45DNAgp45 + DNAnm/s250 nmgp44/624.0 ± 2.335.1 ± 4.339.6 ± 1.51450 ± 200250 nmgp4414.9 ± 4.912.4 ± 4.293.3 ± 5.6103 ± 6250 nm reconstitutedaThe ATPase assay for reconstitution of the CLC was performed directly"
