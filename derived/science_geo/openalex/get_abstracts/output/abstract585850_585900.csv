https://openalex.org/W2610851752,"Muscle and bone are closely associated in both anatomy and function, but the mechanisms that coordinate their synergistic action remain poorly defined. Myostatin, a myokine secreted by muscles, has been shown to inhibit muscle growth, and the disruption of the myostatin gene has been reported to cause muscle hypertrophy and increase bone mass. Extracellular vesicle-exosomes that carry microRNA (miRNA), mRNA, and proteins are known to perform an important role in cell-cell communication. We hypothesized that myostatin may play a crucial role in muscle-bone interactions and may promote direct effects on osteocytes and on osteocyte-derived exosomal miRNAs, thereby indirectly influencing the function of other bone cells. We report herein that myostatin promotes expression of several bone regulators such as sclerostin (SOST), DKK1, and RANKL in cultured osteocytic (Ocy454) cells, concomitant with the suppression of miR-218 in both parent Ocy454 cells and derived exosomes. Exosomes produced by Ocy454 cells that had been pretreated with myostatin could be taken up by osteoblastic MC3T3 cells, resulting in a marked reduction of Runx2, a key regulator of osteoblastic differentiation, and in decreased osteoblastic differentiation via the down-regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of myostatin-modified osteocytic exosomes on osteoblast differentiation is completely reversed by expression of exogenous miR-218, through a mechanism involving miR-218-mediated inhibition of SOST. Together, our findings indicate that myostatin directly influences osteocyte function and thereby inhibits osteoblastic differentiation, at least in part, through the suppression of osteocyte-derived exosomal miR-218, suggesting a novel mechanism in muscle-bone communication."

However, some microRNAs are also modulated by HNF4α, and it is not known whether they are direct targets of HNF4α and whether they influence hepatic function. In this study, we found that HNF4α regulates microRNAs, indicated by marked down-regulation of miR-194 and miR-192 (miR-194/192) in liver-specific Hnf4a-null (Hnf4aΔH) mice. Transactivation of the shared miR-194/192 promoter was dependent on HNF4α expression, indicating that miR-194/192 is a target gene of HNF4α. Screening of potential mRNAs targeted by miR-194/192 revealed that expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism (glycogenin 1 (Gyg1)), cell adhesion and migration (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (Alcam)), tumorigenesis and tumor progression (Rap2b and epiregulin (Ereg)), protein SUMOylation (Sumo2), epigenetic regulation (Setd5 and Cullin 4B (Cln4b)), and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (moesin (Msn)) was up-regulated in Hnf4aΔH mice. Moreover, we also found that miR-194/192 binds the 3′-UTR of these mRNAs. siRNA knockdown of HNF4α suppressed miR-194/192 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and resulted in up-regulation of their mRNA targets. Inhibition and overexpression experiments with miR-194/192 revealed that Gyg1, Setd5, Sumo2, Cln4b, and Rap2b are miR-194 targets, whereas Ereg, Alcam, and Msn are miR-192 targets. These findings reveal a novel HNF4α network controlled by miR-194/192 that may play a critical role in maintaining the hepatocyte-differentiated state by inhibiting expression of genes involved in dedifferentiation and tumorigenesis. These insights may contribute to the development of diagnostic markers for early HCC detection, and targeting of the miR-194/192 pathway could be useful for managing HCC.

Liver has diverse functions such as metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins; detoxification of ammonia and xenobiotics; and synthesis of bile acids and blood coagulation factors.

Of these, HNF4α is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and a key regulator involved in the transcription regulatory network in the liver (2.Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M.

Disruption of HNF4α in the fetal livers showed that hepatic HNF4α is essential for formation of a hepatic epithelium, liver morphogenesis, and liver homeostasis by positive regulation of a large number of genes during development into the mature liver (6.Parviz F.

Disruption of HNF4α in the Hnf4aΔH mice led to diverse phenotypes such as fatty livers and elevation of serum bile acids and ammonia (7.Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Hnf4aΔH mice also exhibit increased spontaneous hepatocyte proliferation and increased susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine-induced liver cancer, indicating that HNF4α has tumor suppressor activity, although the mechanism has not been established (10.Bonzo J.A.

Because HNF4α regulates many liver-enriched genes via HNF4α-binding sites in the promoter regions of the target genes and HNF4α is bound to about 12% of the gene promoters expressed in human hepatocytes (12.Odom D.T. Zizlsperger N. Gordon D.B. Bell G.W. Rinaldi N.J. Murray H.L. Volkert T.L. Schreiber J. Rolfe P.A. Gifford D.K. Fraenkel E. Bell G.I. Young R.A.

The gene expression pattern in the livers of Hnf4aΔH mice is markedly changed largely due to loss of expression of direct HNF4α target genes that are down-regulated, giving rise to the altered phenotypes of these mice (13.Wiwi C.A. Gupte M. Waxman D.J. Sexually dimorphic P450 gene expression in liver-specific hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α-deficient mice.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1975-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For instance, reduced expression of ornithine transcarbamylase (Otc), encoded by a HNF4α target gene, caused elevated serum ammonia due to the inability to degrade ammonia (8.Inoue Y. Hayhurst G.P. Inoue J. Mori M. Gonzalez F.J. Defective ureagenesis in mice carrying a liver-specific disruption of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). HNF4α regulates ornithine transcarbamylase in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25257-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, many mRNAs are up-regulated in Hnf4aΔH mice. Although direct transcriptional repression by HNF4α itself could be considered as a mechanism by which these mRNAs are reduced in Hnf4aΔH mice, another possibility is the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) that could be under direct transcriptional control of HNF4α. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in various physiological functions such as development, differentiation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis through their ability to down-regulate protein-coding gene expression by binding to target mRNAs and either promoting mRNA degradation or inhibiting mRNA translation (14.Ambros V. The functions of animal microRNAs.Nature. 2004; 431: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (9043) Google Scholar, 15.Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P. Baltimore D. MicroRNAs and immunity: tiny players in a big field.Immunity. 2007; 26: 133-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). miRNAs have important roles in liver diseases such as viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, polycystic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (16.Chen Y. Verfaillie C.M. MicroRNAs: the fine modulators of liver development and function.Liver Int. 2014; 34: 976-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17.Wang X.W. Heegaard N.H. Orum H. MicroRNAs in liver disease.Gastroenterology. 2012; 142: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Among the miRNAs, miR-122 is the most abundant in adult liver (18.Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Identification of tissue-specific microRNAs from mouse.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2744) Google Scholar). Expression of miR-122 is reduced in HCC, and overexpression of miR-122 suppresses cell proliferation (19.Kutay H. Bai S. Datta J. Motiwala T. Pogribny I. Frankel W. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. Downregulation of miR-122 in the rodent and human hepatocellular carcinomas.J. Cell Biochem. 2006; 99: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 20.Bai S. Nasser M.W. Wang B. Hsu S.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 32015-32027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, miR-122 could function as a tumor suppressor gene against HCC. Expression of miR-122 positively correlates with HNF4α expression in HCC cell lines, and miR-122 is directly regulated by HNF4α, indicating that the HNF4α-directed miR-122 pathway could be essential for inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation and HCC development (21.Coulouarn C. Factor V.M. Andersen J.B. Durkin M.E. Thorgeirsson S.S.

Hepatol. 2011; 55: 602-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Likewise, HNF4α directly regulates the expression of miR-134 and miR-134-suppressed oncogenic KRAS expression, revealing that miR-134 has a suppressive effect on HCC progression (23.Yin C. Wang P.Q. Xu W.P. Yang Y. Zhang Q. Ning B.F. Zhang P.P. Zhou W.P. Xie W.F. Chen W.S. Zhang X. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α reverses malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma through regulating miR-134 in the DLK1-DIO3 region.Hepatology. 2013; 58: 1964-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, the following HNF4α–miRNA inflammatory feedback circuits in human HCC have been proposed. HNF4α positively regulates miR-7 and miR-124 followed by suppression of IL6R, STAT3, and RelA-mediated NF-κB pathways, eventually resulting in the up-regulation of HNF4α through down-regulation of miR-24, miR-629, or miR-21 (24.Hatziapostolou M. Polytarchou C. Aggelidou E. Drakaki A. Poultsides G.A. Jaeger S.A. Ogata H. Karin M. Struhl K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Iliopoulos D.

Wang H.Y. et al.Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α-nuclear factor-κB feedback circuit modulates liver cancer progression.Hepatology. 2014; 60: 1607-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results also indicate that lack of HNF4α-controlled miRNAs could result in HCC development by activation of inflammatory signaling. These miRNAs were identified from studies using immortalized hepatocytes or HCC cell lines and thus could be biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and candidates for new target genes for HCC therapy. However, miRNAs regulated by HNF4α in normal hepatocytes but not in immortalized or transformed hepatocytes remain to be identified. In this study, the miRNAs regulated by HNF4α were examined using Hnf4aΔH mice. miR-194 and miR-192, controlled by the same promoter, were down-regulated in Hnf4aΔH mice, and HNF4α directly bound to the promoter region of the miR-194–2 and miR-192 (miR-194/192) gene cluster. Furthermore, miR-194 and miR-192 directly targeted many mRNAs including frizzled-6 (Fzd6), Gyg1, Setd5, Sumo2, Cln4b, Rap2b, Ereg, Alcam, and Msn. The HNF4α–miR-194/192 cascade was also conserved in the human HCC cell line. Consequently, the HNF4α–miR-194/192 pathway could be a novel HNF4α cascade and a candidate for early detection of HCC and development of anti-HCC drugs. HNF4α positively regulates the expression of many genes through HNF4α-binding sites in promoter regions (1.Schrem H. Klempnauer J. Borlak J.

Med. 2006; 84: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, several up-regulated genes were also detected in Hnf4aΔH mice, but their mechanism of increase is not known. Although transcriptional repression of genes such as Snail, Slug, and HMGA2 by HNF4α was demonstrated (27.Santangelo L. Marchetti A. Cicchini C. Conigliaro A. Conti B. Mancone C. Bonzo J.A. Gonzalez F.J. Alonzi T. Amicone L. Tripodi M.

Another possibility for negatively regulated mRNAs is indirectly through miRNA. Indeed, HNF4α is known to regulate the expression of miR-7, miR-122, miR-124, and miR-134 (22.Li Z.Y. Xi Y. Zhu W.N.

Thus, expression profiling of hepatic miRNAs in Hnf4a-floxed (Hnf4af/f) and Hnf4aΔH mice was investigated by microarray analysis (supplemental Table S1). Of 610 miRNAs, expression of 24 and 19 miRNAs was down-regulated or up-regulated more than 2-fold in Hnf4aΔH mice, respectively (Table 1). In general, because HNF4α positively regulates the target genes, down-regulated miRNAs in Hnf4aΔH mice could be direct target genes for HNF4α. Although other miRNAs, including miR-34a and miR-301a, were increased in Hnf4aΔH mice, they were not investigated in the current study. They could be either directly repressed by HNF4α or the result of downstream events mediated by loss of expression of other direct HNF4α target genes.Table 1Expression profiling of hepatic miRNAs in Hnf4aΔH micemiRNAFold change (Hnf4aΔH/Hnf4af/f)Down-regulatedmiR-1940.11 (77.4/698.7)miR-4550.11 (1.4/12.5)miR-8050.16 (21.8/137.6)miR-1920.17 (96.5/559.5)miR-1930.25 (22.3/89.5)miR-3650.27 (4.4/16.1)miR-193b0.31 (19.8/64.1)miR-2030.31 (6.9/22.1)miR-130a0.32 (55.3/171.8)miR-467a*, -d*0.32 (1.3/4.1)miR-3770.33 (1.3/4.0)miR-2200.37 (1.1/3.0)miR-466b-3-3p0.38 (1.0/2.6)miR-101b0.39 (29.6/75.5)miR-323-5p0.43 (1.6/3.7)miR-299*0.43 (1.3/3.0)miR-574-3p0.44 (8.3/19.0)miR-669e0.46 (1.7/3.7)miR-210.47 (127.8/270.0)miR-6800.47 (3.7/7.8)miR-467f0.47 (2.8/6.0)miR-8020.47 (2.1/4.5)miR-425*0.48 (1.2/2.5)miR-290-3p0.48 (1.0/2.1)Up-regulatedmiR-34a5.99 (53.9/9.0)miR-301a4.59 (7.8/1.7)miR-283.34 (9.7/2.9)miR-4973.06 (19.9/6.5)miR-4842.97 (11.3/3.8)miR-181a2.92 (11.1/3.8)miR-6892.56 (4.6/1.8)miR-3502.41 (14.0/5.8)miR-5002.41 (7.0/2.9)miR-1522.32 (24.6/10.6)miR-125a-5p2.31 (65.1/28.2)miR-312.29 (151.7/66.2)miR-1952.28 (50.9/22.3)miR-335-5p2.27 (11.8/5.2)miR-31*2.26 (4.3/1.9)miR-142-5p2.23 (13.6/6.1)miR-140*2.16 (14.9/6.9)miR-151-5p2.10 (26.1/12.4)miR-200b2.05 (19.5/9.5)miR-2151.38 (2.5/1.8)miR-1220.93 (7459/8046) Open table in a new tab The expression of miR-194 was decreased by 90% in Hnf4aΔH mice compared with Hnf4af/f mice. miR-194 was also expressed at considerably higher levels in Hnf4af/f mice when compared with other miRNAs. Similarly, the expression of miR-192 was also higher in Hnf4af/f mice and markedly lower in Hnf4aΔH mice. Indeed, qRT-PCR quantification showed that hepatic expression of miR-194 and miR-192 was suppressed by about one-tenth in Hnf4aΔH mice (Fig. 1A). Expression of other liver-enriched miRNAs such as miR-21, -101b, -130a, -193, -193b, -455, and -805 was also decreased in Hnf4aΔH mice (Fig. 1A). Others have reported that the expression of miR-194 and miR-192 is regulated under the same promoter, and tissue distribution of miR-194 and miR-192 is almost equivalent to that of HNF4α (28.Hino K.

Therefore, further studies were performed on miR-194 and miR-192. No significant difference in hepatic expression of miR-7, miR-122, miR-124, and miR-134, which were reported as the target miRNAs for HNF4α (22.Li Z.Y. Xi Y. Zhu W.N. Zeng C. Zhang Z.Q. Guo Z.C.

In mice, mature miR-194 is located on two chromosomes with miR-194-1 and miR-194-2 clustered with miR-215 and miR-192, respectively. Expression of miR-215 was unchanged in Hnf4aΔH mice, and the expression level was very low as compared with miR-194 and miR-192 (Table 1). Thus, miR-194-2, but not miR-194-1, could be highly expressed in normal liver and preferentially suppressed in Hnf4aΔH mice. As expected, hepatic expression of pri-miR-194-1 was unchanged, whereas expression of pri-miR-194-2 was markedly suppressed in Hnf4aΔH mice (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that HNF4α could directly activate the miR-194/192 gene via a single promoter. HNF1α, another liver-enriched transcription factor, directly regulates the miR-194/192 gene through a binding site in the miR-194/192 promoter region (28.Hino K. Tsuchiya K. Fukao T. Kiga K. Okamoto R. Kanai T. Watanabe M. Inducible expression of microRNA-194 is regulated by HNF-1α during intestinal epithelial cell differentiation.RNA. 2008; 14: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accordingly, qRT-PCR analysis using the livers of Hnf4aΔH mice and Hnf1a-null mice was performed to determine which factor, HNF1α or HNF4α, predominates in controlling expression of the miR-194/192 gene. Hepatic expression of both miRNAs in Hnf1a-null mice was reduced to 50%, and the remnant levels were much higher when compared with Hnf4aΔH mice (Fig. 1C). Because HNF4α positively regulates Hnf1a in the liver (2.Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Crabtree G.R. A transcriptional hierarchy involved in mammalian cell-type specification.Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), decreased expression of miR-194/192 in Hnf4aΔH mice could be due to decreased expression of both Hnf1a and Hnf1a. Therefore, the expression of Hnf4a and Hnf1a mRNAs in Hnf1a-null mice was also investigated. The expression of Hnf4a was reduced to 3%, and the expression of Hnf1a mRNA was reduced to 45% in Hnf4aΔH mice (Fig. 1D). Conversely, expression of Hnf1a mRNA was not detected, and expression of Hnf4a mRNA was reduced to 42% in Hnf1a-null mice (Fig. 1E), revealing that the remaining expression of Hnf1a in Hnf4aΔH mice and Hnf4a in Hnf1a-null mice is similar. Hence, HNF4α could be a more essential factor for controlling expression of miR-194/192 as compared with HNF1α in the liver. p53 also has the potential to transcriptionally control the miR-194/192 gene (29.Jenkins R.H.

However, p53 was up-regulated in Hnf4aΔH mice, whereas it was unchanged in Hnf1a-null mice (Fig. 2, A and C).

To mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, spatial zonation schemes can be implemented to separate human activities from key wildlife habitats, e.g., by designating undisturbed wildlife refuges or areas with some level of restriction to human recreation and land use. However, mitigation practice rarely considers temporal differences in human-wildlife interactions. We used GPS telemetry data from 15 red deer to study the seasonal (winter vs. summer) and diurnal (day vs. night) variation in recreation effects on habitat use in a study region in south-western Germany where a spatial zonation scheme has been established. Our study aimed to determine if recreation infrastructure and spatial zonation affected red deer habitat use and whether these effects varied daily or seasonally. Recreation infrastructure did not affect home range selection in the study area, but strongly determined habitat use within the home range. The spatial zonation scheme was reflected in both of these two levels of habitat selection, with refuges and core areas being more frequently used than the border zones. Habitat use differed significantly between day and night in both seasons. Both summer and winter recreation trails, and nearby foraging habitats, were avoided during day, whereas a positive association was found during night. We conclude that human recreation has an effect on red deer habitat use, and when designing mitigation measures daily and seasonal variation in human-wildlife interactions should be taken into account. We advocate using spatial zonation in conjunction with temporal restrictions (i.e., banning nocturnal recreation activities) and the creation of suitable foraging habitats away from recreation trails."

Cystinosis is associated with defects in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), but the molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show CMA substrate accumulation in cystinotic kidney proximal tubule cells. We also found mislocalization of the CMA lysosomal receptor LAMP2A and impaired substrate translocation into the lysosome caused by defective CMA in cystinosis. The impaired LAMP2A trafficking and localization were rescued either by the expression of wild-type cystinosin or by the disease-associated point mutant CTNS-K280R, which has no cystine transporter activity. Defective LAMP2A trafficking in cystinosis was found to associate with decreased expression of the small GTPase Rab11 and the Rab7 effector RILP. Defective Rab11 trafficking in cystinosis was rescued by treatment with small-molecule CMA activators. RILP expression was restored by up-regulation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), which was down-regulated in cystinosis. Although LAMP2A expression is independent of TFEB, TFEB up-regulation corrected lysosome distribution and lysosomal LAMP2A localization in Ctns−/− cells but not Rab11 defects. The up-regulation of Rab11, Rab7, or RILP, but not its truncated form RILP-C33, rescued LAMP2A-defective trafficking in cystinosis, whereas dominant-negative Rab11 or Rab7 impaired LAMP2A trafficking. Treatment of cystinotic cells with a CMA activator increased LAMP2A localization at the lysosome and increased cell survival. Altogether, we show that LAMP2A trafficking is regulated by cystinosin, Rab11, and RILP and that CMA up-regulation is a potential clinically relevant mechanism to increase cell survival in cystinosis.

Although individually the incidence of LSD occurrence is ∼1:100,000, the incidence, as a group, is about 1:5,000. Cystinosis is a LSD caused by genetic defects in the CTNS gene, which codes for cystinosin, the lysosomal cystine transporter (1.Town M. Jean G. Cherqui S. Attard M. Forestier L. Whitmore S.A. Callen D.F. Gribouval O. Broyer M. Bates G.P. van't Hoff W. Antignac C. A novel gene encoding an integral membrane protein is mutated in nephropathic cystinosis.Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). These defects cause the anomalous accumulation of the amino acid cystine in lysosomes leading to cell malfunction affecting kidneys, eyes, muscle, liver, and brain (2.Gahl W.A. Thoene J.G. Schneider J.A. Cystinosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). As with most LSDs, this leads to a slow but irreversible deterioration, organ dysfunction, and death. The treatment of choice for cystinosis is cysteamine, which reduces the intra-lysosomal level of cystine, retards the rate of glomerular deterioration, and improves linear growth in children with cystinosis. However, even treated patients eventually need transplantation and have a short life expectancy. Thus, despite the efficiency of cysteamine in decreasing lysosomal overload, cell malfunction, progressive renal injury, and tissue failure occur despite cystine depletion therapy (3.Cherqui S. Cysteamine therapy: a treatment for cystinosis, not a cure.Kidney Int. 2012; 81: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that cystine accumulation is not the only cause for all the defects in cystinosis (3.Cherqui S.

CTNS encodes a 367-amino acid protein with seven-transmembrane domains. Several mutations in the CTNS gene have been associated with the development of three different onsets of cystinosis. The most severe form, infantile cystinosis, is manifested early in life and is characterized by the development of renal Fanconi syndrome and early kidney and corneal complications. In addition, cystine accumulation in patients with infantile cystinosis eventually leads to retinal, endocrinological, hepatic, gastrointestinal, muscular, and neurological anomalies (5.Kalatzis V. Nevo N. Cherqui S. Gasnier B. Antignac C. Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The juvenile form of the disease is manifested by an onset of photophobia and defective glomerular function during adolescence. Finally, ocular non-nephropathic cystinosis is characterized by mild photophobia without renal anomalies. An extensive and comprehensive genetic correlation between mutations in the CTNS gene, the cystine transporter activity of cystinosin, and the clinical manifestations of the disease have been previously described by Antignac and co-workers (5.Kalatzis V. Nevo N. Cherqui S. Gasnier B. Antignac C. Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although most genetic defects leading to loss-of-function cause the more severe form of the disease, infantile cystinosis, some mutants with abolished cystine transport activity are associated with the milder phenotype of juvenile cystinosis (5.Kalatzis V. Nevo N. Cherqui S. Gasnier B. Antignac C. Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These data suggest that CTNS may carry out currently unknown functions that are relevant for disease development. Autophagic pathways are essential cellular processes that consist of the digestion of cellular components through lysosomal degradation (6.Klionsky D. Autophagy: from phenomenology to molecular understanding in less than a decade.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions, autophagy represents a quality control mechanism that ensures degradation of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. However, in response to different stresses, including starvation, the activation of these pathways also promotes cell survival by providing cells with amino acids and nutrients (7.Kroemer G. Mariño G. Levine B. Autophagy and the integrated stress response.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 280-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). CMA is a selective form of autophagy through which specific cytoplasmic proteins containing a recognition motif (biochemically related to the pentapeptide KFERQ) are bound by a cytoplasmic chaperone complex and delivered to a lysosomal receptor, which mediates the translocation of these CMA substrates into the lysosomal lumen for degradation (8.Kaushik S. Cuervo A. Chaperone-mediated autophagy: a unique way to enter the lysosome world.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 407-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). To date, the only known lysosomal receptor for CMA is LAMP2A, one of the three spliced variants encoded by the lamp2 gene and the only isoform required for CMA function (9.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M.

LAMP2A is dispensable for other types of autophagy (9.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J.

A receptor for the selective uptake and degradation of proteins by lysosomes.Science. 1996; 273: 501-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Substrate binding to LAMP2A is limiting for CMA, and cells use changes in LAMP2A levels to up-regulate or down-regulate CMA (9.Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Unique properties of lamp2a compared to other lamp2 isoforms.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Massey A.C. Kaushik S. Sovak G. Kiffin R. Cuervo A.M.

Regulation of lamp2a levels in the lysosomal membrane.Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Changes in the rate of LAMP2A synthesis, its regulation by degradation, and its sub-compartmentalization and organization at the lysosome all contribute to modulation of CMA activity (8.Kaushik S. Cuervo A. Chaperone-mediated autophagy: a unique way to enter the lysosome world.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 407-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms regulating LAMP2A trafficking, dynamics changes at the lysosomal membrane, and lysosomal localization are not completely elucidated. CMA accounts for the digestion of a significant amount of the proteome (8.Kaushik S. Cuervo A. Chaperone-mediated autophagy: a unique way to enter the lysosome world.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 407-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and is particularly important in protein elimination under oxidative stress, a condition markedly elevated in cystinosis (4.Vaisbich M.H.

In previous studies, we revealed a defective mechanism of CMA in cystinosis (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D.

Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We showed abnormal expression levels and localization of the CMA receptor LAMP2A in cystinotic cells and defective lysosomal degradation of CMA substrates in cystinotic lysosomes. Defective CMA was rescued by expression of wild-type cystinosin but not by treatment with cysteamine, although both approaches significantly decreased lysosomal overload (19.Napolitano G.

In this work, we characterize a novel mechanism of CMA regulation by CTNS, which facilitates LAMP2A trafficking, lysosomal localization, and function. Furthermore, we present evidence that treatment with small-molecule CMA activators increases survival of cystinotic cells independently of lysosomal overload, thus highlighting possible novel treatments for cystinosis through improvement of CMA. Cystinotic cells are characterized by mislocalization of the CMA receptor, LAMP2A, with normal LAMP1 distribution at lysosomes and impaired CMA activity (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Impairment of chaperone-mediated autophagy leads to selective lysosomal degradation defects in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but in vivo defective mislocalization of LAMP2A has not been demonstrated, and the discrete steps during CMA-mediated substrate processing that are impaired in cystinosis have not been elucidated. Here, we first analyzed LAMP2A distribution in disease-relevant kidney proximal tubule cells, the main target of cystinosis. In Fig. 1A, we show that proximal tubule cells from Ctns−/− mice show apical distribution of LAMP2A but the absence of the lysosomal protein in basal areas of the proximal tubule cells. To determine whether LAMP2A mislocalization is associated with the deficient processing of CMA substrates, we next analyzed endogenous levels of the CMA substrate GAPDH by quantitative immunofluorescence analysis. In Fig. 1B, we show CMA substrate accumulation in tissues from Ctns−/− mice indicating, for the first time, abnormal CMA in CTNS-deficient proximal tubule cells. Next, we use a quantitative super-resolution microscopy approach to study the defective LAMP2A localization at the lysosomal membrane. We show that LAMP2A localizes at micro-domains that are characterized by the adjacent distribution of LAMP1 in wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we demonstrate that in cystinotic cells, LAMP2A localizes at micro-domains that are different from those enriched in the lysosomal membrane-associated protein LAMP1 (Fig. 1C). To unequivocally determine the localization of LAMP2A relative to LAMP1, quantitative analysis after drift correction indicates that although >50% of LAMP2A molecules are located at distances that are <100 nm from LAMP1-positive micro-domains in wild-type cells, cystinotic cells show a significantly decreased number (<20%) of LAMP2A molecules present at these lysosomal membrane micro-domains (Fig. 1D). Because the correct distribution of LAMP2A at the lysosomal membrane and its proper molecular multimerization and association with lysosomal membrane proteins regulate its susceptibility to degradation and function (20.Kaushik S. Bandyopadhyay U. Sridhar S. Kiffin R. Martinez-Vicente M. Kon M. Orenstein S.J. Wong E. Cuervo A.M. Chaperone-mediated autophagy at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we next hypothesized that the defective lysosomal distribution of LAMP2A in cystinotic cells may lead to impaired substrate internalization into the lysosome. To determine whether CMA defects in cystinosis is caused by impaired translocation of the CMA substrate into the lysosomal lumen due to decreased LAMP2A, we analyzed CMA activity (Fig. 1E, red box) and CMA substrate translocation into the lysosomal lumen (Fig. 1E, green box) using an assay that is considered the gold standard for testing CMA (21.Kaushik S. Cuervo A. Chaperone-mediated autophagy.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 445: 227-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We optimized this assay to obtain CMA-active lysosomes, whose integrity was verified by measuring β-hexosaminidase activity in purified lysosomes compared with burst lysosomes, as described previously (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Impairment of chaperone-mediated autophagy leads to selective lysosomal degradation defects in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the presence of functional intraluminal proteases, internalized substrate is readily degraded, and therefore external, membrane-bound, and undigested internalized GAPDH can be detected in the full reactions (Fig. 1E, red box). For translocation assays, lysosomes are incubated with GAPDH in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors and spun down before analysis. Lysosomal membrane-bound and translocated substrate is accumulated in the presence of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1E, green box). Thus, the ratio between the amount of pelleted GAPDH in the presence of protease inhibitors versus the amount in the absence of proteases reflects the rate of substrate translocation into the lysosomal lumen. Importantly, the expression levels of LAMP2A are decreased in Ctns−/− lysosomes purified from mouse liver (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Impairment of chaperone-mediated autophagy leads to selective lysosomal degradation defects in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed defective CMA in cystinotic lysosomes using the full reaction (Fig. 1F). Next, to define whether impaired CMA could be caused by defective binding or translocation of the CMA substrates, intact lysosomes were incubated with the CMA substrate GAPDH and pelleted, and the levels of lysosome-associated GAPDH were evaluated in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 1G, the levels of GAPDH associated with WT lysosomes were increased in the presence of protease inhibitors compared with full reactions, indicating active substrate internalization. In contrast, although in full reactions the levels of GAPDH bound to Ctns−/− lysosomes were similar to those bound to WT lysosomes, the amount of GAPDH associated with Ctns−/− lysosomes increased only slightly in the presence of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1G), indicating that cystinotic lysosomes are characterized by functional binding but impaired translocation of CMA substrates. Of note, impaired substrate degradation by lysosomes from Ctns−/− cells is not caused by defective lysosomal proteases (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Impairment of chaperone-mediated autophagy leads to selective lysosomal degradation defects in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Altogether, our data show for the first time that impaired localization of LAMP2A at the lysosomal membrane in cystinotic cells is associated with defective substrate translocation into the lysosomal lumen. CTNS expression but not treatment with cysteamine rescued the localization of LAMP2A at the lysosomal membrane (19.Napolitano G. Johnson J.L. He J. Rocca C.J. Monfregola J. Pestonjamasp K. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Impairment of chaperone-mediated autophagy leads to selective lysosomal degradation defects in the lysosomal storage disease cystinosis.EMBO Mol. Med. 2015; 7: 158-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that CTNS may directly regulate LAMP2A trafficking. Here, to study whether LAMP2A localization depends on the cystine transporter activity of CTNS, we used the mutant CTNSK280R with abolished cystine transporter activity (Fig. 2A). This mutation is manifested in patients with cystinosis and produces a protein that, although unable to reduce lysosomal overload, retains lysosomal localization (5.Kalatzis V. Nevo N. Cherqui S. Gasnier B. Antignac C. Molecular pathogenesis of cystinosis: effect of CTNS mutations on the transport activity and subcellular localization of cystinosin.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both wild-type CTNS and its mutant CTNSK280R localize at LAMP1-positive structures in both wild-type and cystinotic cells (Fig. 2, B–D). We analyzed the localization of endogenous LAMP2A in wild-type, cystinotic, and cystinotic cells expressing exogenous wild-type CTNS or the CTNSK280R mutant and show that the expression of either wild-type protein or CTNSK280R equally rescues the LAMP2A localization-defective phenotype in cystinosis (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that cystinosin itself is a cofactor necessary for LAMP2A sorting or trafficking. Further confirmation of these results comes from quantitative analysis showing that although the colocalization of LAMP1 and LAMP2A is impaired in cystinotic cells, this defect is corrected when the expression of either wild-type CTNS or the CTNSK280R mutant is reconstituted in cystinotic cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, the observation that CTNS and CTNSK280R are similarly effective in rescuing the defective phenotype further supports the idea that CTNS mediates important lysosomal functions in addition to, and independently of, its role as the only cystine transporter in the lysosome. Next, to better understand the molecular mechanism of CTNS-mediated LAMP2A localization at the lysosomal membrane, we analyzed the effect of the CTNS isomeric form CTNS-LKG on LAMP2A subcellular distribution. In CTNS-LKG, the canonical tyrosine-based motif (GYDQL) located in the C-terminal tail is replaced by a 38-amino acid stretch (22.Taranta A. Petrini S. Palma A. Mannucci L. Wilmer M.J. De Luca V. Diomedi-Camassei F. Corallini S. Bellomo F. van den Heuvel L.P. Levtchenko E.N. Emma F. Identification and subcellular localization of a new cystinosin isoform.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 294: F1101-F1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23.Taranta A. Petrini S. Citti A. Boldrini R. Corallini S. Bellomo F. Levtchenko E. Emma F. Distribution of cystinosin-LKG in human tissues.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 138: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, E and F, we show that similar to CTNS and CTNSK280R, CTNS-LKG rescues the LAMP2A mislocalization phenotype demonstrating, for the first time, a cystine transporter-independent function for this isoform. To directly analyze whether CTNS regulates LAMP2A trafficking, LAMP2A dynamics were studied using a high-sensitivity microscopy approach, pseudo-TIRFM, widely used in our and other laboratories to study vesicular trafficking (24.Johnson J.L. Napolitano G. Monfregola J. Rocca C.J. Cherqui S. Catz S.D. Upregulation of the Rab27a-dependent trafficking and secretory mechanisms improves lysosomal transport, alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress, and reduces lysosome overload in cystinosis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 2950-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25.Johnson J.L. Monfregola J. Napolitano G. Kiosses W.B. Catz S.D. Vesicular trafficking through cortical actin during exocytosis is regulated by the Rab27a effector JFC1/Slp1 and the RhoA-GTPase-activating protein Gem-interacting protein.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 1902-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Different from conventional TIRFM, pseudo-TIRFM facilitates the analysis of organelles that may not necessarily be in areas adjacent to the plasma membrane, while maintaining an excellent signal to background ratio (Fig. 3A) (26.Mudrakola H.V. Zhang K. Cui B. Optically resolving individual microtubules in live axons.Structure. 2009; 17: 1433-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For this assay, we use a construct for the expression of LAMP2A as an mCherry-tagged protein (generous gift from Dr. Santiago Di Pietro) (Fig. 3B) that does not interfere with LAMP2A localization (27.Ambrosio A.L. Boyle J.A. Di Pietro S.M. Mechanism of platelet dense granule biogenesis: study of cargo transport and function of Rab32 and Rab38 in a model system.Blood. 2012; 120: 4072-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but because its C-terminal tag interferes with substrate recognition, it does not rescue CMA. Our quantitative vesicular dynamics analysis demonstrates that LAMP2A trafficking is defective in Ctns−/− cells (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Movies 1 and 2). Thus, we show that in the absence of CTNS, LAMP2A-positive vesicles move at a relatively slow speed (Fig. 3D). In addition, we observed a significantly increased number of LAMP2A-positive vesicles with motility restriction (speed under 0.08 μm/s) in Ctns−/− cells, thus supporting a possible role for cystinosin in LAMP2A trafficking. Next, to analyze whether the cystine transporter activity of CTNS is important for restoring LAMP2A trafficking, we performed rescued experiments with the CTNS wild-type protein and with the CTNS disease-associated point mutant CTNSK280R. In Fig. 3D, we show that both wild-type CTNS and the transporter-deficient mutant CTNSK280R rescue the LAMP2A trafficking-defective phenotype in cystinotic cells (see also supplemental Movies 3 and 4). The defect is not related to cytoskeleton disarray, because super-resolution microscopy analysis shows normal microtubule distribution in Ctns−/− cells (supplemental Fig. S1). To further understand a possible cross-regulation between CTNS and LAMP2A, we next asked whether LAMP2A may be necessary for CTNS trafficking and localization. To this end, w"

Contrasting root architectures from wheat, barley and chickpea root systems were grown in soil and scanned using a high resolution micro-tomography system. A macro (Root1) was developed that reliably identified with good to high accuracy complex root systems (10% overestimation for chickpea, 1% underestimation for wheat, 8% underestimation for barley) and provided analysis of root length and angle. In-built flexibility allowed the user interaction to (a) amend any aspect of the macro to account for specific user preferences, and (b) take account of computational limitations of the platform. The platform is free, flexible and accurate in analysing root system metrics."
https://openalex.org/W2611814985,"Psychiatric genetic studies have identified genome-wide significant loci for schizophrenia. The AKT3/1q44 locus is a principal risk region and gene-network analyses identify AKT3 polymorphisms as a constituent of several neurobiological pathways relevant to psychiatric risk; the neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. AKT3 shows prenatal enrichment during human neocortical development and recurrent copy number variations involving the 1q43-44 locus are associated with cortical malformations and intellectual disability, implicating an essential role in early brain development. Here, we investigated the role of AKT3 as it relates to aspects of learning and memory and behavioral function, relevant to schizophrenia and cognitive disability, utilizing a novel murine model of Akt3 genetic deficiency. Akt3 heterozygous (Akt3-/+) or null mice (Akt3-/-) were assessed in a comprehensive test battery. Brain biochemical studies were conducted to assess the impact of Akt3 deficiency on cortical Akt/mTOR signaling. Akt3-/+ and Akt3-/- mice exhibited selective deficits of temporal order discrimination and spatial memory, tasks critically dependent on intact prefrontal-hippocampal circuitry, but showed normal prepulse inhibition, fear conditioned learning, memory for novel objects and social function. Akt3 loss-of-function, reduced brain size and dramatically impaired cortical Akt Ser473 activation in an allele-dose dependent manner. Such changes were observed in the absence of altered Akt1 or Akt2 protein expression. Concomitant reduction of the mTORC2 complex proteins, Rictor and Sin1 identifies a potential mechanism. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurodevelopmental role of Akt3, identify a non-redundant role for Akt3 in the development of prefrontal cortical-mediated cognitive function and show that Akt3 is potentially the dominant regulator of AKT/mTOR signaling in brain."

Increased observations of skin lesions in northern Gulf of Mexico fish during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill indicated the possibility of oil-induced immunocompromisation resulting in bacterial or viral infection. This study used a full factorial design of oil exposure and bacterial challenge to examine how oil exposure impairs southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) immune function and increases susceptibility to the bacteria Vibrio anguillarum, a causative agent of vibriosis. Fish exposed to oil prior to bacterial challenge exhibited 94.4% mortality within 48 hours of bacterial exposure. Flounder challenged with V. anguillarum without prior oil exposure had <10% mortality. Exposure resulted in taxonomically distinct gill and intestine bacterial communities. Mortality strongly correlated with V. anguillarum levels, where it comprised a significantly higher percentage of the microbiome in Oil/Pathogen challenged fish and was nearly non-existent in the No Oil/Pathogen challenged fish bacterial community. Elevated V. anguillarum levels were a direct result of oil exposure-induced immunosuppression. Oil-exposure reduced expression of immunoglobulin M, the major systemic fish antibody, and resulted in an overall downregulation in transcriptome response, particularly in genes related to immune function, response to stimulus and hemostasis. Ultimately, sediment-borne oil exposure impairs immune function, leading to increased incidences of bacterial infections. This type of sediment-borne exposure may result in long-term marine ecosystem effects, as oil-bound sediment in the northern Gulf of Mexico will likely remain a contamination source for years to come."
https://openalex.org/W2610768986,"Drought is a major threat to crop production worldwide and is accentuated by global warming. Plant responses to this abiotic stress involve physiological changes overlapping, at least partially, the defense pathways elicited both by viruses and their herbivore vectors. Recently, a number of theoretical and empirical studies anticipated the influence of climate changes on vector-borne viruses of plants and animals, mainly addressing the effects on the virus itself or on the vector population dynamics, and inferring possible consequences on virus transmission. Here, we directly assess the effect of a severe water deficit on the efficiency of aphid-transmission of the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) or the Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). For both viruses, our results demonstrate that the rate of vector-transmission is significantly increased from water-deprived source plants: CaMV transmission reproducibly increased by 34% and that of TuMV by 100%. In both cases, the enhanced transmission rate could not be explained by a higher virus accumulation, suggesting a more complex drought-induced process that remains to be elucidated. The evidence that infected plants subjected to drought are much better virus sources for insect vectors may have extensive consequences for viral epidemiology, and should be investigated in a wide range of plant-virus-vector systems."

Three of these incidents can be linked to a defined geographical region, while the fourth is likely to be linked. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of strains from these incidents was used for genomic comparisons using two approached. The first was JSpecies tetramer, which analyzed tetranucleotide frequency to assess relatedness. The second, the CFSAN SNP Pipeline, was used to perform WGS SNP analyses against three different reference genomes to evaluate relatedness by SNP distances. In each case, unrelated strains were included as controls. The analyses showed that strains from these incidents form a highly related clade with SNP differences of ≤101 within the clade and >9000 against other strains. Multi-Virulence-Locus Sequence Typing, a third standardized approach for evaluation relatedness, was used to assess the genetic drift in six conserved, known virulence loci and showed a different clustering pattern indicating possible differences in selection pressure experienced by these genes. These data suggest a high degree of relatedness among these 4bV strains linked to a defined geographic region and also highlight the possibility of alterations related to adaptation and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2610762263,"The phosphorus activation coefficient (PAC, the ratio of available P to total P) is an important indicator of soil P availability and the transformation of P fractions. Understanding the details of the PAC is useful to estimate soil available P status and to provide P management guidance. In this research, soils from five long-term (23 years) fertilization treatments in three croplands were selected to examine the relationships between the PAC and P fractions and to analyse the influencing factors. PAC was affected by both soil types and fertilization treatments. Compared to the unfertilized control (CK) treatment, long-term P application significantly increased the PAC, all of the inorganic P (Pi) fractions and most of the organic P (Po) fractions in all the three soils, particularly in chemical fertilizer combined with manure treatment (NPKM). The PAC was significantly correlated to all of the Pi fractions proportions (P<0.05) except for Dil. HCl-Pi and Conc. HCl-Pi. Compared with CK, the chemical P and chemical P combined with manure treatments increased the ratio of total Pi fractions to total Po fractions (Pit/Pot); furthermore, NPKM significantly increased the organic C (Co) content and decreased the Co/Pot ratio. Stepwise multiple regressions showed that PAC = 0.93 Co+0.69 Pit/Pot-0.07 Co/Pot-0.27CaCO3-3.79 (R2 = 0.924, P<0.001). In addition, the variance partitioning analysis showed that more variance of PAC is explained by soil factors (29.53%) than by P input (0.19%) and climate (0.25%) factors. Our findings demonstrate that P application increased the PAC by changing the Co content and the proportion of P fractions. Moreover, soil factors were the most important drivers of P transformations, and NPKM was optimal for improving soil fertility in Chinese croplands."
https://openalex.org/W2610748730,"In humans, hyperthermic episodes can be triggered by halogenated anesthetics [malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility] and by high temperature [environmental heat stroke (HS)]. Correlation between MH susceptibility and HS is supported by extensive work in mouse models that carry a mutation in ryanodine receptor type-1 (RYR1Y522S/WT) and calsequestrin-1 knockout (CASQ1-null), 2 proteins that control Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle. As overheating episodes in humans have also been described during exertion, here we subjected RYR1Y522S/WT and CASQ1-null mice to an exertional-stress protocol (incremental running on a treadmill at 34°C and 40% humidity). The mortality rate was 80 and 78.6% in RYR1Y522S/WT and CASQ1-null mice, respectively, vs. 0% in wild-type mice. Lethal crises were characterized by hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis, classic features of MH episodes. Of importance, pretreatment with azumolene, an analog of the drug used in humans to treat MH crises, reduced mortality to 0 and 12.5% in RYR1Y522S/WT and CASQ1-null mice, respectively, thanks to a striking reduction of hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis. At the molecular level, azumolene strongly prevented Ca2+dependent activation of calpains and NF-kB by lowering myoplasmic Ca2+ concentration and nitro-oxidative stress, parameters that were elevated in RYR1Y522S/WT and CASQ1-null mice.

It is shown that in spite of the extremely small size the organization of Megaphragma retains a considerkable level of structural complexity. On the other hand, miniaturization leads to re-organizations of several organ systems. Unique structural features related to miniaturization have been found in both species: lysis of cell bodies and nuclei of neurons at late stages of pupal development, absence of the heart, and considerable reductions in the set of muscles.

Conversely, the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of selenoprotein P improves insulin resistance and hyperglycemia in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the suppression of selenoprotein P production in the liver may be a novel therapeutic target for reducing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (6Misu H.

In addition, physiological concentrations of selenoprotein P inhibits VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation, tubule formation, and migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, leading to impaired angiogenesis and delay in wound closure in selenoprotein P-overxpressing mice, suggesting that selenoprotein P causes VEGF resistance (9Ishikura K.

However, few drugs have been identified that can inhibit the production of selenoprotein P in hepatocytes.

SREBP-1c, one of three SREBP isoforms and a key transcription factor, is responsible in fatty acid synthesis (28Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H.

The PUFAs specific suppression of lipogenic enzymes is reportedly mediated by reduction of nuclear SREBP-1c protein without affecting SREBP-2 in the liver (29Kim H.J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O.

In addition, the primary mechanism behind PUFAs suppression of SREBP-1 reportedly functions at the proteolytic processing level and this suppression in turn decreases mRNA transcription through an autoloop regulatory circuit (33Takeuchi Y.

It has been suggested that AMPK, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, is a key enzyme in regulating hepatic metabolism of glucose and lipids. Its activation could be involved in EPA-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity (34Flachs P. Mohamed-Ali V. Horakova O. Rossmeisl M. Hosseinzadeh-Attar M.J. Hensler M. Ruzickova J. Kopecky J.

In contrast, another study has suggested that dietary fish oils do not activate AMPK in mouse tissues (37Dobrzyn A. Dobrzyn P. Miyazaki M. Ntambi J.M. Polyunsaturated fatty acids do not activate AMP-activated protein kinase in mouse tissues.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 332: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The role of the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway in hepatocytes, an important target of EPA, still remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that EPA suppresses SELENOP gene expression by inactivating SREBP-1c independently of the AMPK pathway in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes, indicating a possible beneficial effect on the pathology of type 2 diabetes. EPA caused concentration- and time-dependent suppression in Selenop mRNA expression, similarly to the suppression of Srebf1 and fatty acid synthase (encoded by Fasn in rat), a central enzyme in de novo lipogenesis and an established target of the SREBP-1 pathway, mRNAs (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). Next, we examined the effects of EPA on SELENOP promoter activity. The human SELENOP promoter region was cloned to a luciferase reporter vector, as previously reported (11Takayama H. Misu H. Iwama H. Chikamoto K. Saito Y. Murao K. Teraguchi A. Lan F. Kikuchi A. Saito R. Tajima N. Shirasaki T. Matsugo S. Miyamoto K.-I. Kaneko S. Takamura T.

Similar to the results of mRNAs, EPA suppressed SELENOP promoter activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). Because previous reports indicated that PUFAs down-regulate SREBP-1 via inhibition of nuclear translocation of SREBP-1 (33Takeuchi Y. Yahagi N. Izumida Y. Nishi M. Kubota M. Teraoka Y. Yamamoto T.

Kopecky J. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin induce adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat diet.Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we confirmed the mechanism through which EPA inactivates SREBP-1c by examining the intracellular localization of SREBP-1c in EPA-treated H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. To determine the intracellular localization of SREBP-1c, the cytosolic and nuclear components of the SREBP-1c protein were fractionated (Fig. 1E). EPA treatment reduced SREBP-1c protein levels in the nuclear fraction in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). Considering previous reports (31Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. Regulatory element binding protein-1 expression is suppressed by dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol.

Kopecky J. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin induce adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat diet.Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), these results are suggestive of EPA inactivating SREBP-1c by inhibiting its nuclear translocation in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. To determine the nature of the EPA-response element in the SELENOP promoter region, we constructed several deletion mutants of the SELENOP promoter (Fig. 2A). Promoter activity of Mutant (Mut)-A, -B, -C, -D, and Normal, but not Mut-E, was suppressed by EPA treatment (Fig. 2A), indicating the existence of EPA-response element of the SELENOP promoter in Mut-D. Additional deletion mutants of Mut-D were constructed and named Mut-DΔ1 to DΔ3. Promoter activity of Mut-DΔ1 and DΔ2 but not Mut-DΔ3 was suppressed by EPA treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating the existence of EPA-response element of the SELENOP promoter in Mut-DΔ2. Using computational analysis to identify conserved transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) among the species as previously reported (11Takayama H. Misu H. Iwama H. Chikamoto K. Saito Y. Murao K.

We focused on the putative SREBP-1c-binding sites (Fig. 2C). Indeed, SREBP-1c is reportedly a key regulator of lipid synthesis and PUFA-specific suppression of nuclear SREBP-1c protein in the liver (29Kim H.J. Takahashi M. Ezaki O.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35840-35844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether Selenop expression is affected by the specific knockdown of endogenous SREBP-1 in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes. Transfection with Srebf1-specific siRNA reduced Srebf1 mRNA levels by ∼50% (Fig. 3A). This Srebf1 knockdown also significantly down-regulated Selenop expression to a similar extent (Fig. 3A). Conversely, we investigated if SREBP-1c overexpression influences SELENOP promoter activity. The SREBP-1 protein was overexpressed in cells transfected with the precursor SREBP-1a, precursor SREBP-1c, and mature SREBP-1c expression vectors (Fig. 3B). The mature SREBP-1c overexpression especially inhibited the suppressive effect of EPA on SELENOP promoter activity (Fig. 3C); however, SREBP-1a overexpression had no effect (data not shown). These results suggest an association of SREBP-1c activity with the EPA-induced suppression of SELENOP expression. We previously found that metformin suppressed SELENOP expression via the AMPK/FoxO3a pathway (11Takayama H. Misu H. Iwama H. Chikamoto K. Saito Y. Murao K. Teraguchi A. Lan F. Kikuchi A. Saito R. Tajima N. Shirasaki T. Matsugo S. Miyamoto K.-I. Kaneko S. Takamura T.

Furthermore, previous reports indicated the possible involvement of AMPK activation in EPA-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity (34Flachs P. Mohamed-Ali V. Horakova O. Rossmeisl M.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin induce adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat diet.Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and also that AMPK phosphorylation inhibits SREBP-1 (35Li Y.

SREBP activity is regulated by mTORC1 and contributes to Akt-dependent cell growth.Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 224-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether AMPK pathways are involved in the EPA-induced suppression of SELENOP promoter activity, we treated H4IIEC3 hepatocytes with compound C, a representative AMPK inhibitor. Consequently, the findings confirmed that the EPA-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was canceled by the administration of compound C in H4IIEC3 hepatocytes (Fig. 4A); these findings corroborate those of a previous study (34Flachs P. Mohamed-Ali V. Horakova O. Rossmeisl M. Hosseinzadeh-Attar M.J. Hensler M. Ruzickova J. Kopecky J. Polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin induce adiponectin in mice fed a high-fat diet.Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, co-administration of compound C and EPA suppressed somewhat the Selenop mRNA expression and SELENOP promoter activity (Fig. 4, B and C). Furthermore, we tested the effects of the dominant-negative form of AMPK on EPA-mediated suppression of Selenop mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 4D, AMPK dominant-negative had no effect on Selenop mRNA expression. These results suggest that EPA suppressed SELENOP promoter activity independently of the AMPK pathway. To determine the critical SREBP-1c-binding site for EPA-induced SELENOP suppression, we constructed luciferase vectors that deleted the putative SRE, binding sites of SREBP-1c. It is called M"
https://openalex.org/W2610990377,"Mucin1 (MUC1), a glycoprotein associated with chemoresistance and an aggressive cancer phenotype, is aberrantly overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Recent studies suggest that MUC1 plays a role in modulating cancer cell metabolism and thereby supports tumor growth. Herein, we examined the role of MUC1 in metabolic reprogramming in TNBC.MUC1 was stably overexpressed in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells and stably knocked down in MDA-MB-468 cells. We performed liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry-assisted metabolomic analyses and physiological assays, which indicated significant alterations in the metabolism of TNBC cells due to MUC1 expression.Differential analyses identified significant differences in metabolic pathways implicated in cancer cell growth. In particular, MUC1 expression altered glutamine dependency of the cells, which can be attributed in part to the changes in the expression of genes that regulate glutamine metabolism, as observed by real-time PCR analysis. Furthermore, MUC1 expression altered the sensitivity of cells to transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate (AOA), potentially by altering glutamine metabolism.Collectively, these results suggest that MUC1 serves as a metabolic regulator in TNBC, facilitating the metabolic reprogramming of glutamine utilization that influences TNBC tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2610959445,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition characterized by overzealous inflammation that leads to joint damage and is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Statins are frontline therapeutics for patients with cardiovascular disease and exert beneficial actions in rheumatoid arthritis. The mechanism that mediates the beneficial actions of statins in rheumatoid arthritis remains of interest. In the present study, we found that the administration of 2 clinically relevant statins—atorvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) or pravastatin (0.2 mg/kg)—to mice during inflammatory arthritis up-regulated systemic and tissue amounts of a novel family of proresolving mediators, termed 13-series resolvins (RvTs), and significantly reduced joint disease. Of note, administration of simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) did not significantly up-regulate RvTs or reduce joint inflammation. We also found that atorvastatin and pravastatin each reduced systemic leukocyte activation, including platelet-monocyte aggregates (∼25–60%). These statins decreased neutrophil trafficking to the joint as well as joint monocyte and macrophage numbers. Atorvastatin and pravastatin produced significant reductions (∼30–50%) in expression of CD11b and major histocompatibility complex class II on both monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages in joints. Administration of an inhibitor to cyclooxygenase-2, the initiating enzyme in the RvT pathway, reversed the protective actions of these statins on both joint and systemic inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2610702061,"The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of neurological disorders anchored by the phenotypes of motor incoordination and cerebellar atrophy. Disease heterogeneity is appreciated through varying comorbidities: dysarthria, dysphagia, oculomotor and/or retinal abnormalities, motor neuron pathology, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, and psychiatric manifestations. Our study focuses on SCA13, which is caused by several allelic variants in the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNC3 (Kv3.3). We detail the clinical phenotype of four SCA13 kindreds that confirm causation of the KCNC3R423H allele. The heralding features demonstrate congenital onset with non-progressive, neurodevelopmental cerebellar hypoplasia and lifetime improvement in motor and cognitive function that implicate compensatory neural mechanisms. Targeted expression of human KCNC3R423H in Drosophila triggers aberrant wing veins, maldeveloped eyes, and fused ommatidia consistent with the neurodevelopmental presentation of patients. Furthermore, human KCNC3R423H expression in mammalian cells results in altered glycosylation and aberrant retention of the channel in anterograde and/or endosomal vesicles. Confirmation of the absence of plasma membrane targeting was based on the loss of current conductance in cells expressing the mutant channel. Mechanistically, genetic studies in Drosophila, along with cellular and biophysical studies in mammalian systems, demonstrate the dominant negative effect exerted by the mutant on the wild-type (WT) protein, which explains dominant inheritance. We demonstrate that ocular co-expression of KCNC3R423H with Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (dEgfr) results in striking rescue of the eye phenotype, whereas KCNC3R423H expression in mammalian cells results in aberrant intracellular retention of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Together, these results indicate that the neurodevelopmental consequences of KCNC3R423H may be mediated through indirect effects on EGFR signaling in the developing cerebellum. Our results therefore confirm the KCNC3R423H allele as causative for SCA13, through a dominant negative effect on KCNC3WT and links with EGFR that account for dominant inheritance, congenital onset, and disease pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2610920078,"Background Wealth quintiles derived from household asset indices are routinely used for measuring socioeconomic inequalities in the health of women and children in low and middle-income countries. We explore whether the use of wealth deciles rather than quintiles may be advantageous. Methods We selected 46 countries with available national surveys carried out between 2003 and 2013 and with a sample size of at least 3000 children. The outcomes were prevalence of under-five stunting and delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA). Differences and ratios between extreme groups for deciles (D1 and D10) and quintiles (Q1 and Q5) were calculated, as well as two summary measures: the slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CIX). Results In virtually all countries, stunting prevalence was highest among the poor, and there were larger differences between D1 and D10 than between Q1 and Q5. SBA coverage showed pro-rich patterns in all countries; in four countries the gap was greater than 80 pct points. With one exception, differences between extreme deciles were larger than between quintiles. Similar patterns emerged when using ratios instead of differences. The two summary measures provide very similar results for quintiles and deciles. Patterns of top or bottom inequality varied with national coverage levels. Conclusion Researchers and policymakers should consider breakdowns by wealth deciles, when sample sizes allow. Use of deciles may contribute to advocacy efforts, monitoring inequalities over time, and targeting health interventions. Summary indices of inequalities were unaffected by the use of quintiles or deciles in their calculation."
https://openalex.org/W2611032031,"New radiochemistry techniques can yield novel PET tracers for COX-2 and address the shortcomings in in vivo stability and specificity, which have held back clinical translation of tracers to image COX-2 expression. Current techniques limit radiosynthesis to analogs of the COX-2 inhibitors with fluorine-18 added via a carbon chain, or on an aromatic position which renders the radiolabeled analog less specific towards COX-2, resulting in tracers with low in vivo stability or specificity. To solve this problem, we have developed a new high affinity, 18F-labelled COX-2 inhibitor that is radiolabeled directly on a heteroaromatic ring. This molecule exhibits favorable biodistribution and increased metabolic stability. Synthesis of this molecule cannot be achieved by traditional means; consequently, we have developed an automated electrochemical radiosynthesis platform to synthesize up to 5 mCi of radiochemically pure 18F-COX-2ib in 4 hours (2% decay-corrected radiochemical yield). In vitro studies demonstrated clear correlation between COX-2 expression and uptake of the tracer. PET imaging of healthy animals confirmed that the molecule is excreted from blood within an hour, mainly through the hepatobiliary excretion pathway. In vivo metabolism data demonstrated that > 95% of the injected radioactivity remains in the form of the parent molecule 1 hour after injection."
https://openalex.org/W2611072353,"Landscape genetic studies based on neutral genetic markers have contributed to our understanding of the influence of landscape composition and configuration on gene flow and genetic variation. However, the potential for species to adapt to changing landscapes will depend on how natural selection influences adaptive genetic variation. We demonstrate how landscape resistance models can be combined with genetic simulations incorporating natural selection to explore how the spread of adaptive variation is affected by landscape characteristics, using desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in three differing regions of the southwestern United States as an example. We conducted genetic sampling and least-cost path modeling to optimize landscape resistance models independently for each region, and then simulated the spread of an adaptive allele favored by selection across each region. Optimized landscape resistance models differed between regions with respect to landscape variables included and their relationships to resistance, but the slope of terrain and the presence of water barriers and major roads had the greatest impacts on gene flow. Genetic simulations showed that differences among landscapes strongly influenced spread of adaptive genetic variation, with faster spread (1) in landscapes with more continuously distributed habitat and (2) when a pre-existing allele (i.e., standing genetic variation) rather than a novel allele (i.e., mutation) served as the source of adaptive genetic variation. The combination of landscape resistance models and genetic simulations has broad conservation applications and can facilitate comparisons of adaptive potential within and between landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2610423816,"To identify plasma markers predictive of therapeutic response in patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).Fifty HIV-negative patients with active pulmonary MDR-TB were analysed for six soluble analytes in plasma at the time of initiating treatment (baseline) and over six months thereafter. Patients were identified as sputum culture positive or negative at baseline. Culture positive patients were further stratified by the median time to sputum culture conversion (SCC) as fast responders (< 76 days) or slow responders (≥ 76 days). Chest X-ray scores, body mass index, and sputum smear microscopy results were obtained at baseline.Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that baseline plasma levels of IP-10/CXCL10, VEGF-A, SAA and CRP could distinguish sputum culture and cavitation status of patients. Among patients who were culture positive at baseline, there were significant positive correlations between plasma levels of CRP, SAA, VEGF-A, sIL-2Rα/CD40, and IP-10 and delayed SCC. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Receiver Operating Curves (ROC), we showed that a combination of MCP-1/CCL2, IP-10, sIL-2Rα, SAA, CRP and AFB smear could distinguish fast from slow responders and were predictive of delayed SCC with high sensitivity and specificity.Plasma levels of specific chemokines and inflammatory markers measured before MDR-TB treatment are candidate predictive markers of delayed SCC. These findings require validation in a larger study."
https://openalex.org/W2610553658,"Background Epidemiological data on asthma among adults in sub-Saharan Africa are sparse. Objective To determine the prevalence of and factors associated with asthma among adults in Kinshasa. Methods A previously validated asthma questionnaire was administered to an adult population aged ≥18 years in urban and peri-urban suburbs of Kinshasa. A random stratified multi-stage sampling plan was used to select the study participants. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with asthma. Results The mean age of respondents was 36.7 (SD 15.36) years, 75% lived in an urban environment, and 57% were women. The prevalence of asthma-ever was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.4–8.4). Among asthmatic patients, intermittent asthma was estimated at 75.7% and severe asthma at 9.3%. Family atopy (OR: 3.97; 95% CI: 2.42–6.50; p<0.001), and the presence of a cat in the house (OR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.01–3.28; p = 0.045) were associated with self-reported asthma. Conclusion Asthma is relatively frequent in adults in Kinshasa, a prevalence similar to those reported elsewhere in Africa. Family atopy and the presence of a cat in the house could be the most common determinants to be confirmed with national survey in order to design guidelines for the control of asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2611088586,"Hu sheep lambskin is a unique white lambskin from China that exhibits three types of flower patterns, including small waves, medium waves, and large waves, with small waves considered the best quality. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying flower pattern formation in Hu sheep lambskin is limited. The aim of the present study was to further explore the relevance between candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) and developmental characteristics of hair follicles and screen miRNAs for later functional validation. Herein, we employed Illumina Hiseq 2500 to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in hair follicles of different flower patterns with small, medium, and large waves to construct a comprehensive sequence database on the mechanism of hair follicle development. Paraffin sections of lambskin tissue were prepared to assess the structure of different hair follicles. Expression levels of candidate miRNAs in different flower patterns were analyzed by relative quantitation using real-time PCR, combined with histological observation and micro-observation technologies, and the correlation between expression levels of candidate miRNAs and histological properties of hair follicles was analyzed by using SPSS 17.0. A total of 522 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and RNA-seq analysis detected 7,266 target genes in different groups of flower patterns. Gene ontological analysis indicated these target genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, apoptosis, and ion transport, and 14 miRNAs, including miR-143, miR-10a, and let-7 were screened as candidate miRNAs in Hu sheep hair follicle growth and development. In the same field of vision, variance analysis showed that the number of secondary follicles in small waves was significantly larger than that in large and medium waves (P<0.01); the diameter of the primary and secondary follicles in large waves was respectively larger than those in medium and small waves (P<0.01). Combined with correlation analysis between miRNA expression and histological properties of hair follicles, highly significant differences in miRNA-143 expression levels between large and small waves were observed (P<0.01), and significant differences in the miRNA-10a expression levels between large and small waves (P<0.05) and in let-7i expression levels between large and medium waves were observed (P<0.05). Significant differences in the expression of novel miRNAs of NW_004080184.1_6326 between medium and large waves were detected (P<0.05), and highly significant differences between medium and small waves were observed (P<0.01). Highly significant differences in the expression level of NW_004080165.1_8572 between medium and large and small waves (P<0.01), in that of NW_004080181.1_3961 between medium and small waves (P<0.01), and in that of NW_004080190.1_13733 between medium and large waves were observed, whereas no significant differences in the other miRNAs among large, medium, and small waves were detected. Overall, the present study showed that miRNA-143, miRNA-10a, let-7i, NW_004080184.1_6326, NW_004080165.1_8572, NW_004080181.1_3961, and NW_004080190.1_13733 could be considered as important candidate genes, indicating these seven miRNAs may play significant roles in hair follicle growth and development in Hu sheep lambskin."
https://openalex.org/W2610715153,"Culturing the economically important macroalga Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Rhodophyta) is limited due to the high temperatures in the summertime on the southern Chinese coast. Previous studies have demonstrated that two phytohormones, salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MJ), can alleviate the adverse effects of high-temperature stress on Gp. lemaneiformis. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying SA- and MJ-mediated heat tolerance, we performed comprehensive analyses of transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. A total of 14,644 unigenes were assembled, and 10,501 unigenes (71.71%) were annotated to the reference databases. In the SA, MJ and SA/MJ treatment groups, 519, 830, and 974 differentially expressed unigenes were detected, respectively. Unigenes related to photosynthesis and glycometabolism were enriched by SA, while unigenes associated with glycometabolism, protein synthesis, heat shock and signal transduction were increased by MJ. A crosstalk analysis revealed that 216 genes were synergistically regulated, while 18 genes were antagonistically regulated by SA and MJ. The results indicated that the two phytohormones could mitigate the adverse effects of heat on multiple pathways, and they predominantly acted synergistically to resist heat stress. These results will provide new insights into how SA and MJ modulate the molecular mechanisms that counteract heat stress in algae."
https://openalex.org/W2611442135,"In response to limited nutrients, fungal cells exit the primary growth phase, enter the stationary phase, and cease proliferation. Although fundamental to microbial physiology in many environments, the regulation of this transition is poorly understood but likely involves many transcriptional regulators. These may include the sirtuins, which deacetylate acetyllysine residues of histones and epigenetically regulate global transcription. Therefore, we investigated the role of a nuclear sirtuin, sirtuin E (SirE), from the ascomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans An A. nidulans strain with a disrupted sirE gene (SirEΔ) accumulated more acetylated histone H3 during the stationary growth phase when sirE was expressed at increased levels in the wild type. SirEΔ exhibited decreased mycelial autolysis, conidiophore development, sterigmatocystin biosynthesis, and production of extracellular hydrolases. Moreover, the transcription of the genes involved in these processes was also decreased, indicating that SirE is a histone deacetylase that up-regulates these activities in the stationary growth phase. Transcriptome analyses indicated that SirE repressed primary carbon and nitrogen metabolism and cell-wall synthesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SirE deacetylates acetylated Lys-9 residues in histone H3 at the gene promoters of α-1,3-glucan synthase (agsB), glycolytic phosphofructokinase (pfkA), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (gpdA), indicating that SirE represses the expression of these primary metabolic genes. In summary, these results indicate that SirE facilitates the metabolic transition from the primary growth phase to the stationary phase. Because the observed gene expression profiles in stationary phase matched those resulting from carbon starvation, SirE appears to control this metabolic transition via a mechanism associated with the starvation response."
https://openalex.org/W2611575265,"Introduction Osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is generally effective for treating large cartilage lesions. Cleansing OCA subchondral bone to remove donor marrow elements is typically performed with pulsed lavage. However, the effects of clinical and experimental parameters on OCA marrow removal by pulsed lavage are unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects on marrow cleansing in human osteochondral cores (OCs) of (1) lavage duration, (2) lavage flow intensity, and (3) OC sample type and storage condition. Methods OCs were harvested from human femoral condyles and prepared to a clinical geometry (cylinder, diameter = 20 mm). The OCs were from discarded remnants of Allograft tissues (OCA) or osteoarthritis patients undergoing Total Knee Replacement (OCT). The experimental groups subjected to standard flow lavage for 45 seconds (430 mL of fluid) and 120 seconds (1,150 mL) were (1) OCT/FROZEN (stored at -80°C), (2) OCT/FRESH (stored at 4°C), and (3) OCA/FRESH. The OCA/FRESH group was subsequently lavaged at high flow for 45 seconds (660 mL) and 120 seconds (1,750 mL). Marrow cleansing was assessed grossly and by micro-computed tomography (μCT). Results Gross and μCT images indicated that marrow cleansing progressed from the OC base toward the cartilage. Empty marrow volume fraction (EMa.V/Ma.V) increased between 0, 45, and 120 seconds of standard flow lavage, and varied between groups, being higher after FROZEN storage (86–92% after 45–120 seconds) than FRESH storage of either OCT or OCA samples (36% and 55% after 45 and 120 seconds, respectively). With a subsequent 120 seconds of high flow lavage, EMa.V/Ma.V of OCA/FRESH samples increased from 61% to 78%. Conclusions The spatial and temporal pattern of marrow space clearance was consistent with gradual fluid-induced extrusion of marrow components. Pulsed lavage of OCAs with consistent time and flow intensity will help standardize marrow cleansing and may improve clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2611958394,"To survive in its sand fly vector, the trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania first attaches to the midgut to avoid excretion, but eventually it must detach for transmission by the next bite. In Leishmania major strain Friedlin, this is controlled by modifications of the stage-specific adhesin lipophosphoglycan (LPG). During differentiation to infective metacyclics, d-arabinopyranose (d-Arap) caps the LPG side-chain galactose residues, blocking interaction with the midgut lectin PpGalec, thereby leading to parasite detachment and transmission. Previously, we characterized two closely related L. major genes (FKP40 and AFKP80) encoding bifunctional proteins with kinase/pyrophosphorylase activities required for salvage and conversion of l-fucose and/or d-Arap into the nucleotide-sugar substrates required by glycosyltransferases. Whereas only AFKP80 yielded GDP-d-Arap from exogenous d-Arap, both proteins were able to salvage l-fucose to GDP-fucose. We now show that Δafkp80- null mutants ablated d-Arap modifications of LPG as predicted, whereas Δfkp40- null mutants resembled wild type (WT). Fucoconjugates had not been reported previously in L. major, but unexpectedly, we were unable to generate fkp40-/afkp80- double mutants, unless one of the A/FKPs was expressed ectopically. To test whether GDP-fucose itself was essential for Leishmania viability, we employed ""genetic metabolite complementation."" First, the trypanosome de novo pathway enzymes GDP-mannose dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-fucose synthetase (GMER) were expressed ectopically; from these cells, the Δfkp40-/Δafkp80- double mutant was now readily obtained. As expected, the Δfkp40-/Δafkp80-/+TbGMD-GMER line lacked the capacity to generate GDP-Arap, while synthesizing abundant GDP-fucose. These results establish a requirement for GDP-fucose for L. major viability and predict the existence of an essential fucoconjugate(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2610272279,"Purpose Physiological colonic 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake is a frequent finding on 18F-FDG positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT). Interestingly, metformin, a glucose lowering drug associated with moderate weight loss, is also associated with an increased colonic 18F-FDG uptake. Consequently, increased colonic glucose use might partly explain the weight losing effect of metformin when this results in an increased energy expenditure and/or core body temperature. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether metformin modifies the metabolic activity of the colon by increasing glucose uptake. Methods In this open label, non-randomized, prospective mechanistic study, we included eight lean and eight overweight males. We measured colonic 18F-FDG uptake on PET-CT, energy expenditure and core body temperature before and after the use of metformin. The maximal colonic 18F-FDG uptake was measured in 5 separate segments (caecum, colon ascendens,—transversum,—descendens and sigmoid). Results The maximal colonic 18F-FDG uptake increased significantly in all separate segments after the use of metformin. There was no significant difference in energy expenditure or core body temperature after the use of metformin. There was no correlation between maximal colonic 18F-FDG uptake and energy expenditure or core body temperature. Conclusion Metformin significantly increases colonic 18F-FDG uptake, but this increased uptake is not associated with an increase in energy expenditure or core body temperature. Although the colon might be an important site of the glucose plasma lowering actions of metformin, this mechanism of action does not explain directly any associated weight loss."

https://openalex.org/W2611130425,"Human lysosomal-associated protein multispanning membrane 5 (LAPTM5) was identified by an ordered differential display-polymerase chain reaction (ODD-PCR) as an up-regulated cDNA fragment during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of U937 cells into monocytes/macrophages. After TPA-treatment, the levels of LAPTM5 mRNA and protein increased and reached a maximum at 18-36 h. In healthy human tissues, LAPTM5 mRNA was expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells and tissues, at low levels in the lung and fetal liver, and was not detected in other non-hematopoietic tissues. LAPTM5 mRNA was detected in immature malignant cells of myeloid lineage, such as K562, HL-60, U937, and THP-1 cells, and in unstimulated peripheral T cells, but was absent or barely detectable in lymphoid malignant or non-hematopoietic malignant cells. The LAPTM5 level in HL-60 cells increased more significantly during TPA-induced monocyte/macrophage differentiation than during DMSO-induced granulocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of GFP-LAPTM5 or LAPTM5 in HeLa cells exhibited the localization of LAPTM5 to the lysosome. In HeLa cells overexpressing LAPTM5, the Mcl-1 and Bid levels declined markedly and apoptosis was induced via Bak activation, Δψm loss, activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3, and PARP degradation without accompanying necrosis. However, these LAPTM5-induced apoptotic events except for the decline of Bid level were completely abrogated by concomitant overexpression of Mcl-1. The pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak by ~40% but failed to block the induced Δψm loss, whereas the broad-range inhibitor of cathepsins (Cathepsin Inhibitor I) could suppress the LAPTM5-induced apoptotic sub-G1 peak and Δψm loss, by ~22% and ~23%, respectively, suggesting that the LAPTM5-mediated Δψm loss was exerted at least in part in a cathepsin-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of LAPTM5 in HeLa cells induced apoptosis via cleavage of Mcl-1 and Bid by a LAPTM5-associated lysosomal pathway, and subsequent activation of the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2610678791,"PTEN is among the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancer. However, studying the role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of cancer has been limited, in part, by the paucity of human cell-based isogenic systems that faithfully model PTEN loss. In an effort to remedy this problem, gene editing was used to correct an endogenous mutant allele of PTEN in two human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines- 42MGBA and T98G. PTEN correction resulted in reduced cellular proliferation that was Akt-dependent in 42MGBA cells and Akt-independent in T98G cells. This is the first report of human cancer cell lines in which mutant PTEN has been corrected by gene editing. The isogenic sets of gene edited cell lines reported here will likely prove useful for further study of PTEN mutations in the pathogenesis of cancer, and for the discovery and validation of novel therapeutics targeting the PTEN pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2611697992,"Purpose Comparisons between institutions of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) are significantly confounded by individual patient characteristics, and currently there is a paucity of methods available to calculate risk-adjusted metrics. Methods We extracted de-identified data from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database for admissions between January 1 2011 and December 31 2015. We used a mixed-effects log-normal regression model to predict LOS using patient and admission characteristics. We calculated a risk-adjusted LOS ratio (RALOSR) by dividing the geometric mean observed LOS by the exponent of the expected Ln-LOS for each site and year. The RALOSR is scaled such that values <1 indicate a LOS shorter than expected, while values >1 indicate a LOS longer than expected. Secondary mixed effects regression modelling was used to assess the stability of the estimate in units over time. Results During the study there were a total of 662,525 admissions to 168 units (median annual admissions = 767, IQR:426–1121). The mean observed LOS was 3.21 days (median = 1.79 IQR = 0.92–3.52) over the entire period, and declined on average 1.97 hours per year (95%CI:1.76–2.18) from 2011 to 2015. The RALOSR varied considerably between units, ranging from 0.35 to 2.34 indicating large differences after accounting for case-mix. Conclusions There are large disparities in risk-adjusted LOS among Australian and New Zealand ICUs which may reflect differences in resource utilization."

In this study, we focused on the signaling from GPCRs to RhoA via Ga13 and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). The activation of Ga13 was elucidated in living cells with high temporal and spatial resolution by means of FRET. The inactivation after agonist withdrawal occurred in the same range (t1/2 = 25.3 6 2.2 s; mean 6 SEM; n = 22) as described for other Ga proteins. The interaction of Ga13 and LARG and the thereby-induced LARG translocation to the plasma membrane were at least 1 order of magnitude more stable after agonist withdrawal, exceeding Ga13 deactivation in the absence of LARG several fold. Consequently, we observed an almost 100-fold higher agonist sensitivity of the Ga13 LARG interaction compared to the Ga13 activation in the absence of LARG.—Bodmann, E.-L., Krett, A.-L., Bünemann, M.

https://openalex.org/W2611117059,We report here where the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of bonobos (Pan paniscus) ranged and how they dispersed throughout their current habitat. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecular dating to analyze the time to MRCA (TMRCA) and the major mtDNA haplogroups of wild bonobos were performed using new estimations of divergence time of bonobos from other Pan species to investigate the dispersal routes of bonobos over the forest area of the Congo River's left bank. The TMRCA of bonobos was estimated to be 0.64 or 0.95 million years ago (Ma). Six major haplogroups had very old origins of 0.38 Ma or older. The reconstruction of the ancestral area revealed the mitochondrial ancestor of the bonobo populations ranged in the eastern area of the current bonobos' habitat. The haplogroups may have been formed from either the riparian forests along the Congo River or the center of the southern Congo Basin. Fragmentation of the forest refugia during the cooler periods may have greatly affected the formation of the genetic structure of bonobo populations.
https://openalex.org/W2611262101,"It is well established that animal vocalizations can encode information regarding a sender’s identity, sex, age, body size, social rank and group membership. However, the association between physiological parameters, particularly stress hormone levels, and vocal behavior is still not well understood. The cooperatively breeding African meerkats (Suricata suricatta) live in family groups with despotic social hierarchies. During foraging, individuals emit close calls that help maintain group cohesion. These contact calls are acoustically distinctive and variable in rate across individuals, yet, information on which factors influence close calling behavior is missing. The aim of this study was to identify proximate factors that influence variation in call rate and acoustic structure of meerkat close calls. Specifically, we investigated whether close calling behavior is associated with sex, age and rank, or stress hormone output (i.e., measured as fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations) as individual traits of the caller, as well as with environmental conditions (weather) and reproductive seasonality. To disentangle the effects of these factors on vocal behavior, we analyzed sound recordings and assessed fGCM concentrations in 64 wild but habituated meerkats from 9 groups during the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. Dominant females and one-year old males called at significantly higher rates compared to other social categories during the reproductive season. Additionally, dominant females produced close calls with the lowest mean fundamental frequencies (F0) and the longest mean pulse durations. Windy conditions were associated with significantly higher call rates during the non-reproductive season. Fecal GCM concentrations were unrelated to close calling behavior. Our findings suggest that meerkat close calling behavior conveys information regarding the sex and social category of the caller, but shows no association with fGCM concentrations. The change in call rate in response to variation in the social and ecological environments individuals experience indicates some degree of flexibility in vocal production."
https://openalex.org/W2610647397,"Background and objectives High concentrations of local anesthetics may be neurotoxic for diabetic patients. Additive perineural administration of magnesium was reported to decrease the consumption of local anesthetics for nerve block. It was hypothesized that MgSO4 added to dilute ropivacaine was equianalgesic to more concentrated ropivacaine for toe amputations in diabetic patients. Methods Seventy diabetic patients were allocated into 3 groups: 1) perineural 200 mg MgSO4 added to 0.25% ropivacaine, 2) 0.25% ropivacaine alone, and 3) 0.375% ropivacaine alone. All patients underwent popliteal sciatic nerve block that was guided by ultrasonography using the respective regimens. Time of onset, duration of motor and sensory block were recorded. Spontaneous and evoked pain score, worst pain score, additional analgesic consumption, satisfaction score and initial time of analgesic requirement of each patient were documented up to 48 hours postoperatively. Results In comparison with 0.25% ropivacaine alone, magnesium supplement prolonged the duration of sensory block (p = 0.001), as well as better evoked pain score at 6 hour postoperatively (p = 0.001). In comparison with evoked pain score (1.6/10) in group of 0.375% ropivacaine, magnesium plus 0.25% ropivacaine presented a little higher score (2.5/10) at 6 hour postoperatively (p = 0.001), while lower worst pain score (p = 0.001) and less postoperative total analgesic consumption (p = 0.002). Conclusions The regimen of adding 200mg MgSO4 to 0.25% ropivacaine for sciatic nerve block yields equal analgesic effect in comparison with 0.375% ropivacaine. These findings have suggested that supplemental MgSO4 could not improve analgesic quality except reducing the total amount of local anesthetics requirement in diabetic toe amputations with sciatic nerve blocks."
https://openalex.org/W2611042500,"Pathologically elevated immune activation and inflammation contribute to HIV disease progression and immunodeficiency, potentially mediated by elevated levels of prostaglandin E2, which suppress HIV-specific T cell responses. We have previously shown that a high dose of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib can reduce HIV-associated immune activation and improve IgG responses to T cell-dependent vaccines. In this follow-up study, we included 56 HIV-infected adults, 28 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve and 28 on ART with undetectable plasma viremia but CD4 counts below 500 cells/μL. Patients in each of the two study groups were randomized to receive 90 mg qd of the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor etoricoxib for six months, two weeks or to a control arm, respectively. T cell activation status, HIV Gag-specific T cell responses and plasma inflammatory markers, tryptophan metabolism and thrombin generation were analyzed at baseline and after four months. In addition, patients received tetanus toxoid, conjugated pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines, to which IgG responses were determined after four weeks. In ART-naïve patients, etoricoxib reduced the density of the activation marker CD38 in multiple CD8+ T cell subsets, improved Gag-specific T cell responses, and reduced in vitro plasma thrombin generation, while no effects were seen on plasma markers of inflammation or tryptophan metabolism. No significant immunological effects of etoricoxib were observed in ART-treated patients. Patients receiving long-term etoricoxib treatment had poorer tetanus toxoid and conjugated pneumococcal vaccine responses than those receiving short-course etoricoxib. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors may attenuate harmful immune activation in HIV-infected patients without access to ART."
https://openalex.org/W2611955433,"Background An association between AS03 adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine and the occurrence of Bell’s palsy was found in a population based cohort study in Stockholm, Sweden. To evaluate this association in a different population, we conducted a self-controlled case series in a primary health care database, THIN, in the United Kingdom. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an increased risk of Bell’s palsy following vaccination with any influenza vaccine containing A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like viral strains. Secondly, we investigated whether risks were different following pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines and seasonal influenza vaccines containing the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. Methods The study population comprised all incident Bell’s palsy cases between 1 June 2009 and 30 June 2013 identified in THIN. We determined the relative incidence (RI) of Bell’s palsy during the 6 weeks following vaccination with either pandemic or seasonal influenza vaccine. All analyses were adjusted for seasonality and confounding variables. Results We found an incidence rate of Bell’s palsy of 38.7 per 100,000 person years. Both acute respiratory infection (ARI) consultations and pregnancy were found to be confounders. When adjusted for seasonality, ARI consultations and pregnancies, the RI during the 42 days after vaccination with an influenza vaccine was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72–1.01). The RI was similar during the 42 days following seasonal vaccine (0.96, 95%CI: 0.82–1.13) or pandemic vaccine (0.73, 95%CI: 0.47–1.12). Conclusion We found no evidence for an increased incidence of Bell’s palsy following seasonal influenza vaccination overall, nor for monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine in 2009."
https://openalex.org/W2610388885,"Foodborne pathogenic bacteria are exposed to a number of environmental stresses during food processing, storage, and preparation, and in the human body. In order to improve the safety of food, the understanding of molecular stress response mechanisms foodborne pathogens employ is essential. Many response mechanisms that are activated during heat shock may cross-protect bacteria against other environmental stresses. To better understand the molecular mechanisms Clostridium botulinum, the causative agent of botulism, utilizes during acute heat stress and during adaptation to stressfully high temperature, the C. botulinum Group I strain ATCC 3502 was grown in continuous culture at 39°C and exposed to heat shock at 45°C, followed by prolonged heat stress at 45°C to allow adaptation of the culture to the high temperature. Growth in continuous culture was performed to exclude secondary growth phase effects or other environmental impacts on bacterial gene transcription. Changes in global gene expression profiles were studied using DNA microarray hybridization. During acute heat stress, Class I and III heat shock genes as well as members of the SOS regulon were activated. The neurotoxin gene botA and genes encoding the neurotoxin-associated proteins were suppressed throughout the study. Prolonged heat stress led to suppression of the sporulation machinery whereas genes related to chemotaxis and motility were activated. Induced expression of a large proportion of prophage genes was detected, suggesting an important role of acquired genes in the stress resistance of C. botulinum. Finally, changes in the expression of a large number of genes related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism indicated remodeling of the cellular metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2611546889,"An oxygen insensitive azoreductase was purified from a novel bacterial strain (Staphylococcus sp. KU898286) that was isolated from an abandoned site of the textile waste discharge unit. The isolated enzyme had efficiently cleaved the azo-bonds through reductive transformation under aerobic conditions. Initial phenotypic characterization and final construction of phylogenetic tree on the basis of 16s rDNA demonstrated 99% resemblance of the isolate to Staphylococcus aureus. The purified azoreductase was found to have a broad spectrum activity that reduced RR241 at a concentration of 50mg/L with pH between 6–8 and 30°C temperature). Besides, the reactive red 241 (RR241) was reduced at extracellular level as well as NADH dependent intracellular level. Complete reduction/ decolourization of RR241 were achieved after 18 hrs of exposure. The final degradation product observed to be 2-nephthol was purified by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and the molecular mass was computed by Gas Chromatography-Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The study revealed a cost effective and eco-friendly approach to degrade the toxic dyes into less toxic products by Staphylococcus sp. KU898286."
https://openalex.org/W2610373723,"Our previous work on angiotensin II-mediated electrical-remodeling in canine left ventricle, in connection with a long history of other studies, suggested the hypothesis: increases in mechanical load induce autocrine secretion of angiotensin II (A2), which coherently regulates a coterie of membrane ion transporters in a manner that increases contractility. However, the relation between load and A2 secretion was correlative. We subsequently showed a similar or identical system was present in murine heart. To investigate whether the relation between mechanical load and A2-mediated electrical remodeling was causal, we employed transverse aortic constriction in mice to subject the left ventricle to pressure overload for short-term (1 to 2 days) or long-term (1 to 2 weeks) periods. Heart-to-body weight ratios and cell capacitance measurements were used to determine hypertrophy. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of the predominant repolarization currents Ito,fast and IK,slow were used to assess electrical remodeling. Hearts or myocytes subjected to long-term load displayed significant hypertrophy, which was not evident in short-term load. However, short-term load induced significant reductions in Ito,fast and IK,slow. Incubation of these myocytes with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor inhibitor saralasin for 2 hours restored Ito,fast and IK,slow to control levels. The number of Ito.fast or IK,slow channels did not change with A2 or long-term load, however the hypertrophic increase in membrane area reduced the current densities for both channels. For Ito,fast but not IK,slow there was an additional reduction that was reversed by inhibition of angiotensin receptors. These results suggest increased load activates an endogenous renin angiotensin system that initially reduces Ito,fast and IK,slow prior to the onset of hypertrophic growth. However, there are functional interactions between electrical and anatomical remodeling. First, hypertrophy tends to reduce all current densities. Second, the hypertrophic program can modify signaling between the angiotensin receptor and target current."
https://openalex.org/W2610172848,"CO2 seeps in coral reefs were used as natural laboratories to study the impacts of ocean acidification on the pontellid copepod, Labidocera spp. Pontellid abundances were reduced by ∼70% under high-CO2 conditions. Biological parameters and substratum preferences of the copepods were explored to determine the underlying causes of such reduced abundances. Stage- and sex-specific copepod lengths, feeding ability, and egg development were unaffected by ocean acidification, thus changes in these physiological parameters were not the driving factor for reduced abundances under high-CO2 exposure. Labidocera spp. are demersal copepods, hence they live amongst reef substrata during the day and emerge into the water column at night. Deployments of emergence traps showed that their preferred reef substrata at control sites were coral rubble, macro algae, and turf algae. However, under high-CO2 conditions they no longer had an association with any specific substrata. Results from this study indicate that even though the biology of a copepod might be unaffected by high-CO2, Labidocera spp. are highly vulnerable to ocean acidification."
https://openalex.org/W2610263992,"Along the past years, mobile robots have proliferated both in domestic and in industrial environments to solve some tasks such as cleaning, assistance, or material transportation. One of their advantages is the ability to operate in wide areas without the necessity of introducing changes into the existing infrastructure. Thanks to the sensors they may be equipped with and their processing systems, mobile robots constitute a versatile alternative to solve a wide range of applications. When designing the control system of a mobile robot so that it carries out a task autonomously in an unknown environment, it is expected to take decisions about its localization in the environment and about the trajectory that it has to follow in order to arrive to the target points. More concisely, the robot has to find a relatively good solution to two crucial problems: building a model of the environment, and estimating the position of the robot within this model. In this work, we propose a framework to solve these problems using only visual information. The mobile robot is equipped with a catadioptric vision sensor that provides omnidirectional images from the environment. First, the robot goes along the trajectories to include in the model and uses the visual information captured to build this model. After that, the robot is able to estimate its position and orientation with respect to the trajectory. Among the possible approaches to solve these problems, global appearance techniques are used in this work. They have emerged recently as a robust and efficient alternative compared to landmark extraction techniques. A global description method based on Radon Transform is used to design mapping and localization algorithms and a set of images captured by a mobile robot in a real environment, under realistic operation conditions, is used to test the performance of these algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2611045770,"Core decompression is an efficient treatment for early stage ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. In conventional procedures, the pre-operative X-ray only shows one plane of the ischemic area, which often results in inaccurate drilling. This paper introduces a new method that uses computer-assisted technology and rapid prototyping to enhance drilling accuracy during core decompression surgeries and presents a validation study of cadaveric tests.Twelve cadaveric human femurs were used to simulate early-stage ischemic necrosis. The core decompression target at the anterolateral femoral head was simulated using an embedded glass ball (target). Three positioning Kirschner wires were drilled into the top and bottom of the large rotor. The specimen was then subjected to computed tomography (CT). A CT image of the specimen was imported into the Mimics software to construct a three-dimensional model including the target. The best core decompression channel was then designed using the 3D model. A navigational template for the specimen was designed using the Pro/E software and manufactured by rapid prototyping technology to guide the drilling channel. The specimen-specific navigation template was installed on the specimen using positioning Kirschner wires. Drilling was performed using a guide needle through the guiding hole on the templates. The distance between the end point of the guide needle and the target was measured to validate the patient-specific surgical accuracy.The average distance between the tip of the guide needle drilled through the guiding template and the target was 1.92±0.071 mm.Core decompression using a computer-rapid prototyping template is a reliable and accurate technique that could provide a new method of precision decompression for early-stage ischemic necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2611612790,"Shp-1 (Src homology region 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1) is a phosphatase that is highly expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Whereas its function is largely characterized in hematopoietic cells, its role in epithelial cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), is not well known. Here, we generated mice with an IEC-specific knockout of Shp-1 (Src homology region 2 domain–containing phosphatase-1; Shp-1IEC-KO). We showed that the loss of epithelial Shp-1 leads to an intestinalomegaly that is associated with an increase in epithelial cell proliferation and size. Histologic analysis demonstrates significant perturbation of the crypt-villus architecture with an apparent increase in the number of goblet and Paneth cells and increased expression of their respective markers {Muc2 (mucin 2), aDef, and Sox9 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9]}. Expansion of intermediate cells—common progenitors of goblet and Paneth cell lineages—is also observed in Shp-1IEC-KO mice. Although sustained activation of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling is observed, Shp-1IEC-KO mice fail to develop any intestinal tumors after 15 mo; however, the loss of Shp-1 in IECs markedly enhances tumor load ApcMin/+ mice. These findings show a novel role for Shp-1 in the regulation of IEC growth and secretory lineage allocation, possibly via modulation of PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling pathways. Finally, Shp-1 does not function as a classic tumor suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium.—Leblanc, C., Langlois, M.-J., Coulombe, G., Vaillancourt-Lavigueur, V., Jones, C., Carrier, J.

https://openalex.org/W2611144209,"Fluorescence is increasingly recognized to be widespread in nature. In particular, some arachnids fluoresce externally, and in spiders the hemolymph fluoresces. In this study, we examined the external fluorescence and the fluorophores of different sexes and life stages of the crab spider Misumena vatia (Clerk 1757), a sit-and-wait predator that feeds on insects as they visit flowers. We designed novel instrumentation to measure external fluorescence in whole specimens. We found that although males and females possess internal fluorophores with similar properties, the external expression of fluorescence varies across sexes and life stages. Spiders fluoresce brightly as immatures. Females maintain their brightness to adulthood, whereas males become increasingly dim as they mature. We suggest that external fluorescence likely contributes to visual signaling in these animals, and that it differs between the sexes as a result of differences in foraging ecology and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4250903785,"This study focuses on interactions between nanoparticles and a pesticide. The aim was to investigate how nano-sized aluminum oxide (410 nm) can alter the toxic effects of thiacloprid, even if no sorption between particles and the insecticide takes place. Thus, our study investigated a rather unexplored interaction. We conducted our research with larvae of Chironomus riparius and used thiacloprid as test substance as its toxicity to C. riparius is well described. The used nano-Al2O3 particles where chosen due to their suitable properties. For testing the acute effects of the interaction, we exposed larvae to thiacloprid (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 μg/L) and nano-Al2O3 (300 and 1000 mg/L), either solely or in binary mixtures. While thiacloprid resulted in elevated mortality, nano-Al2O3 solely did not exert any effects. Moreover, we observed an aggregation of nano-Al2O3 within the lumen of the intestinal tract of the larvae. Further results showed a significantly reduced mortality of fourth instar larvae when they were exposed to mixtures of nanoparticles and the pesticide, compared to thiacloprid alone. With increasing nano-Al2O3 concentration, this effect became gradually stronger. Additionally, chemical analyses of internal thiacloprid concentrations implicate reduced uptake of thiacloprid in animals exposed to mixtures. However, as larvae exposed to thiacloprid concentrations > 0.5 μg/L showed severe convulsions, independent of the presence or concentration of nano-Al2O3, we assume that nano-Al2O3 leads to a delay of mortality and does not entirely prevent it. As sorption measurements on pristine or defecated nano-Al2O3 did not reveal any sorptive interaction with thiacloprid, we can exclude sorption-based reduction of thiacloprid bioavailability as a mechanism behind our results. Even though we used test substances which might not co-occur in the environment in the tested concentrations, our study gives evidence for an interaction besides adsorption, which is important to generally understand how nanoparticles might affect biota."
https://openalex.org/W2610986297,"Simultaneous adsorption modeling of four ions was predicted with a strict net charge-neutral ion-exchange theory and its corresponding equilibrium and mass balance equations. An important key to the success of this approach was the proper collection of all the data, particularly the proton adsorption data, and the inclusion of variable concentrations of conjugate ions from the experimental pH adjustments. Using IExFit software, the ion-exchange model used here predicted the competitive retention of several ions on goethite by assuming that the co-adsorption or desorption of all ions occurred in the correct stoichiometries needed to maintain electroneutrality. This approach also revealed that the retention strength of Cl- ions on goethite increases in the presence of phthalate ions. That is, an anion-anion enhancement effect was observed. The retention of Cl- ions was much weaker than phthalate ions, and this also resulted in a higher sensitivity of the Cl- ions toward minor variations in the surface reactivity. The proposed model uses four goethite surface sites. The drop in retention of phthalate ions at low pH was fully described here as resulting from competitive Cl- reactions, which were introduced in increasing concentrations into the matrix as the conjugate base to the acid added to lower the pH."
https://openalex.org/W2611087486,"In the Pacific, the protection of coral reef resources is often achieved through the implementation of village-based marine reserves (VBMRs). While substantial fisheries benefits are often reported, results of quantitative approaches are controversial for benthic macroinvertebrates, whose life history traits may cause low congruence with protective measures implemented at non-ecologically relevant scales. This study investigated the structural and behavioral responses of the exploited topshell Tectus niloticus within a very small (0.2 km2) VBMR in Vanuatu, south Pacific. The results of underwater surveys and a nine-month tagging experiment emphasized contrasted, scale-dependent responses. At the reserve scale, our results failed to demonstrate any positive effect of protection after three years of closure. In contrast, abundance, density and biomass increased more than ten-fold in the southern part of the reserve, along with significantly larger (25%) individual sizes. The dispersal of tagged specimens was also consistently lower after 2, 4 and 9 months in the latter zone. Analyses of 17 substratum variables revealed a marked small-scale patchiness delineating contrasted benthic microhabitats, the distribution of which closely matched that of trochus. We advocate that i) VBMRs have inherently unequal ecological potentials for protecting and managing highly habitat-dependent species such as trochus; ii) ‘success’ or ‘failure’ is to a certain extent pre-determined by the trajectory of species-specific microhabitats, which may outreach protection effects. This has strong implications in the Pacific where the location and size of reserves primarily depends upon marine tenure, and communities have little flexibility in setting reserve boundaries."
