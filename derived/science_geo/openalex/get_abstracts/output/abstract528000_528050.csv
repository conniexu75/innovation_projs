https://openalex.org/W315748477,"Several individual-level factors are known to promote psychological resilience in the aftermath of disasters. Far less is known about the role of community-level factors in shaping postdisaster mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of both individual- and community-level factors on resilience after Hurricane Sandy. A representative sample of household residents (N = 418) from 293 New York City census tracts that were most heavily affected by the storm completed telephone interviews approximately 13–16 months postdisaster. Multilevel multivariable models explored the independent and interactive contributions of individual- and community-level factors to posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms. At the individual-level, having experienced or witnessed any lifetime traumatic event was significantly associated with higher depression and posttraumatic stress, whereas demographic characteristics (e.g., older age, non-Hispanic Black race) and more disaster-related stressors were significantly associated with higher posttraumatic stress only. At the community-level, living in an area with higher social capital was significantly associated with higher posttraumatic stress. Additionally, higher community economic development was associated with lower risk of depression only among participants who did not experience any disaster-related stressors. These results provide evidence that individual- and community-level resources and exposure operate in tandem to shape postdisaster resilience."
https://openalex.org/W266360251,"Background Detection of lung cancer at an early stage by sensitive screening tests could be an important strategy to improving prognosis. Our objective was to identify a panel of circulating microRNAs in plasma that will contribute to early detection of lung cancer. Material and Methods Plasma samples from 100 early stage (I to IIIA) non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 100 non-cancer controls were screened for 754 circulating microRNAs via qRT-PCR, using TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays. Logistic regression with a lasso penalty was used to select a panel of microRNAs that discriminate between cases and controls. Internal validation of model discrimination was conducted by calculating the bootstrap optimism-corrected AUC for the selected model. Results We identified a panel of 24 microRNAs with optimum classification performance. The combination of these 24 microRNAs alone could discriminate lung cancer cases from non-cancer controls with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87-0.95). This classification improved to an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90-0.97) following addition of sex, age and smoking status to the model. Internal validation of the model suggests that the discriminatory power of the panel will be high when applied to independent samples with a corrected AUC of 0.78 for the 24-miRNA panel alone. Conclusion Our 24-microRNA predictor improves lung cancer prediction beyond that of known risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1591550632,"The DNA damage response kinase ATR may be a useful cancer therapeutic target. ATR inhibition synergizes with loss of ERCC1, ATM, XRCC1 and DNA damaging chemotherapy agents. Clinical trials have begun using ATR inhibitors in combination with cisplatin. Here we report the first synthetic lethality screen with a combination treatment of an ATR inhibitor (ATRi) and cisplatin. Combination treatment with ATRi/cisplatin is synthetically lethal with loss of the TLS polymerase ζ and 53BP1. Other DNA repair pathways including homologous recombination and mismatch repair do not exhibit synthetic lethal interactions with ATRi/cisplatin, even though loss of some of these repair pathways sensitizes cells to cisplatin as a single-agent. We also report that ATRi strongly synergizes with PARP inhibition, even in homologous recombination-proficient backgrounds. Lastly, ATR inhibitors were able to resensitize cisplatin-resistant cell lines to cisplatin. These data provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA repair pathways that exhibit synthetic lethality with ATR inhibitors when combined with cisplatin chemotherapy, and will help guide patient selection strategies as ATR inhibitors progress into the cancer clinic."
https://openalex.org/W285262454,"Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles may provide a more soluble and plant available source of Zn in Zn fertilizers due to their greater reactivity compared to equivalent micron- or millimetre-sized (bulk) particles. However, the effect of soil on solubility, spatial distribution and speciation of ZnO nanoparticles has not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined the diffusion and solid phase speciation of Zn in an alkaline calcareous soil following application of nanoparticulate and bulk ZnO coated fertilizer products (monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and urea) using laboratory-based x-ray techniques and synchrotron-based μ-x-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) mapping and absorption fine structure spectroscopy (μ-XAFS). Mapping of the soil-fertilizer reaction zones revealed that most of the applied Zn for all treatments remained on the coated fertilizer granule or close to the point of application after five weeks of incubation in soil. Zinc precipitated mainly as scholzite (CaZn2(PO4)2.2H2O) and zinc ammonium phosphate (Zn(NH4)PO4) species at the surface of MAP granules. These reactions reduced dissolution and diffusion of Zn from the MAP granules. Although Zn remained as zincite (ZnO) at the surface of urea granules, limited diffusion of Zn from ZnO-coated urea granules was also observed for both bulk and nanoparticulate ZnO treatments. This might be due to either the high pH of urea granules, which reduced solubility of Zn, or aggregation (due to high ionic strength) of released ZnO nanoparticles around the granule/point of application. The relative proportion of Zn(OH)2 and ZnCO3 species increased for all Zn treatments with increasing distance from coated MAP and urea granules in the calcareous soil. When coated on macronutrient fertilizers, Zn from ZnO nanoparticles (without surface modifiers) was not more mobile or diffusible compared to bulk forms of ZnO. The results also suggest that risk associated with the presence of ZnO NPs in calcareous soils would be the same as bulk sources of ZnO."
https://openalex.org/W396231929,"It is a matter of debate whether impaired insulin action originates from a defect at the neural level or impaired transport of the hormone into the brain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of aging on insulin concentrations in the periphery and the central nervous system as well as its impact on insulin-dependent brain activity.Insulin, glucose and albumin concentrations were determined in 160 paired human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Additionally, insulin was applied in young and aged mice by subcutaneous injection or intracerebroventricularly to circumvent the blood-brain barrier. Insulin action and cortical activity were assessed by Western blotting and electrocorticography radiotelemetric measurements.In humans, CSF glucose and insulin concentrations were tightly correlated with the respective serum/plasma concentrations. The CSF/serum ratio for insulin was reduced in older subjects while the CSF/serum ratio for albumin increased with age like for most other proteins. Western blot analysis in murine whole brain lysates revealed impaired phosphorylation of AKT (P-AKT) in aged mice following peripheral insulin stimulation whereas P-AKT was comparable to levels in young mice after intracerebroventricular insulin application. As readout for insulin action in the brain, insulin-mediated cortical brain activity instantly increased in young mice subcutaneously injected with insulin but was significantly reduced and delayed in aged mice during the treatment period. When insulin was applied intracerebroventricularly into aged animals, brain activity was readily improved.This study discloses age-dependent changes in insulin CSF/serum ratios in humans. In the elderly, cerebral insulin resistance might be partially attributed to an impaired transport of insulin into the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W297414359,"In four large, nationally representative surveys (N = 11.2 million), American adolescents and emerging adults in the 2010s (Millennials) were significantly less religious than previous generations (Boomers, Generation X) at the same age. The data are from the Monitoring the Future studies of 12th graders (1976-2013), 8th and 10th graders (1991-2013), and the American Freshman survey of entering college students (1966-2014). Although the majority of adolescents and emerging adults are still religiously involved, twice as many 12th graders and college students, and 20%-40% more 8th and 10th graders, never attend religious services. Twice as many 12th graders and entering college students in the 2010s (vs. the 1960s-70s) give their religious affiliation as ""none,"" as do 40%-50% more 8th and 10th graders. Recent birth cohorts report less approval of religious organizations, are less likely to say that religion is important in their lives, report being less spiritual, and spend less time praying or meditating. Thus, declines in religious orientation reach beyond affiliation to religious participation and religiosity, suggesting a movement toward secularism among a growing minority. The declines are larger among girls, Whites, lower-SES individuals, and in the Northeastern U.S., very small among Blacks, and non-existent among political conservatives. Religious affiliation is lower in years with more income inequality, higher median family income, higher materialism, more positive self-views, and lower social support. Overall, these results suggest that the lower religious orientation of Millennials is due to time period or generation, and not to age."
https://openalex.org/W878946039,"Bacopa monnieri has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to improve memory and cognition. The active constituent responsible for its pharmacological effects is bacoside A, a mixture of dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins containing sugar chains linked to a steroid aglycone skeleton. Triterpenoid saponins have been reported to be transformed in vivo to metabolites that give better biological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics. Thus, the activities of the parent compounds (bacosides), aglycones (jujubogenin and pseudojujubogenin) and their derivatives (ebelin lactone and bacogenin A1) were compared using a combination of in silico and in vitro screening methods. The compounds were docked into 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, D1, D2, M1 receptors and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) using AutoDock and their central nervous system (CNS) drug-like properties were determined using Discovery Studio molecular properties and ADMET descriptors. The compounds were screened in vitro using radioligand receptor binding and AChE inhibition assays. In silico studies showed that the parent bacosides were not able to dock into the chosen CNS targets and had poor molecular properties as a CNS drug. In contrast, the aglycones and their derivatives showed better binding affinity and good CNS drug-like properties, were well absorbed through the intestines and had good blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Among the compounds tested in vitro, ebelin lactone showed binding affinity towards M1 (Ki = 0.45 μM) and 5-HT2A (4.21 μM) receptors. Bacoside A and bacopaside X (9.06 μM) showed binding affinity towards the D1 receptor. None of the compounds showed any inhibitory activity against AChE. Since the stimulation of M1 and 5-HT2A receptors has been implicated in memory and cognition and ebelin lactone was shown to have the strongest binding energy, highest BBB penetration and binding affinity towards M1 and 5-HT2A receptors, we suggest that B. monnieri constituents may be transformed in vivo to the active form before exerting their pharmacological activity."
https://openalex.org/W329137226,"Introduction Alcohol use by persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) negatively impacts the public health benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Using a standardized alcohol assessment tool, we estimate the prevalence of alcohol use, identify associated factors, and test the association of alcohol misuse with sexual risk behaviors among PLWHA in Uganda. Methods A cross-section of PLWHA in Kampala were interviewed regarding their sexual behavior and self-reported alcohol consumption in the previous 6 months. Alcohol use was assessed using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT). Gender-stratified log binomial regression analyses were used to identify independent factors associated with alcohol misuse and to test whether alcohol misuse was associated with risky sexual behaviors. Results Of the 725 subjects enrolled, 235 (33%) reported any alcohol use and 135 (18.6%) reported alcohol misuse, while 38 (5.2%) drank hazardous levels of alcohol. Alcohol misuse was more likely among subjects not yet on ART (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] was 1.65 p=0.043 for males and 1.79, p=0.019 for females) and those with self-reported poor adherence (aPR for males=1.56, p=0.052, and for females=1.93, p=0.0189). Belonging to Pentecostal or Muslim religious denominations was protective against alcohol misuse compared to belonging to Anglican and Catholic denominations in both sexes (aPR=0.11 for men, p<0.001, and aPR=0.32 for women, p=0.003). Alcohol misuse was independently associated with reporting risky sexual behaviors (aPR=1.67; 95% CI: 1.07–2.60, p=0.023) among males, but not significant among females (aPR=1.29; 95% CI: 0.95–1.74, p=0.098). Non-disclosure of HIV positive status to sexual partner was significantly associated with risky sex in both males (aPR=1.69; p=0.014) and females (aPR 2.45; p<0.001). Conclusion Alcohol use among PLWHA was high, and was associated with self-reported medication non-adherence, non-disclosure of HIV positive status to sexual partner(s), and risky sexual behaviors among male subjects. Interventions targeting alcohol use and the associated negative behaviors should be tested in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W1859810834,"Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model to study multiple sclerosis (MS). Considering the tolerogenic effects of active vitamin D, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) associated with active vitamin D in EAE development. EAE was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by immunization with MOG emulsified with Complete Freund's Adjuvant plus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Animals also received two intraperitoneal doses of Bordetella pertussis toxin. One day after immunization, mice were treated with 0,1 μg of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) every other day during 15 days (on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15). MOG (150 μg) was co-administered on days 3 and 11. The administration of 1,25(OH)2D3 or MOG determined significant reduction in EAE incidence and in clinical scores. When MOG was associated with 1,25(OH)2D3 the animals did not develop EAE. Spleen and central nervous system (CNS) cell cultures from this group produced less IL-6 and IL-17 upon stimulation with MOG in comparison to the EAE control group. In addition, this treatment inhibited dendritic cells maturation in the spleen and reduced inflammatory infiltration in the CNS. The association of MOG with 1,25(OH)2D3 was able to control EAE development."
https://openalex.org/W234289650,"To control the double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in the developing world, understanding the patterns of morbidity and healthcare-seeking is critical. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine the distribution, predictors and inter-relationship of perceived morbidity and related healthcare-seeking behavior in a poor-resource setting.Between October 2013 and July 2014, 43999 consenting subjects were recruited from 10107 households in Malda district of West Bengal state in India, through multistage random sampling, using probability proportional-to-size. Information on socio-demographics, behaviors, recent ailments, perceived severity and healthcare-seeking were analyzed in SAS-9.3.2.Recent illnesses were reported by 55.91% (n=24,600) participants. Among diagnosed ailments (n=23,626), 50.92% (n=12,031) were NCDs. Respiratory (17.28%, n=7605)), gastrointestinal (13.48%, n=5929) and musculoskeletal (6.25%, n=2749) problems were predominant. Non-qualified practitioners treated 53.16% (n=13,074) episodes. Older children/adolescents [adjusted odds ratio for private healthcare providers (AORPri)=0.76, 95% confidence interval=0.71-0.83) and for Govt. healthcare provider (AORGovt)=0.80(0.68-0.95)], females [AORGovt=0.80(0.73-0.88)], Muslims [AORPri=0.85(0.69-0.76) and AORGovt=0.92(0.87-0.96)], backward castes [AORGovt=0.93(0.91-0.96)] and rural residents [AORPri=0.82(0.75-0.89) and AORGovt=0.72(0.64-0.81)] had lower odds of visiting qualified practitioners. Apparently less severe NCDs [acid-peptic disorders: AORPri=0.41(0.37-0.46) & AORGovt=0.41(0.37-0.46), osteoarthritis: AORPri=0.72(0.59-0.68) & AORGovt=0.58(0.43-0.78)], gastrointestinal [AORPri=0.28(0.24-0.33) & AORGovt=0.69(0.58-0.81)], respiratory [AORPri=0.35(0.32-0.39) & AORGovt=0.46(0.41-0.52)] and skin infections [AORPri=0.65(0.55-0.77)] were also less often treated by qualified practitioners. Better education [AORPri=1.91(1.65-2.22) for ≥graduation], sanitation [AORPri=1.58(1.42-1.75)] and access to safe water [AORPri=1.33(1.05-1.67)] were associated with healthcare-seeking from qualified private practitioners. Longstanding NCDs [chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases: AORPri=1.80(1.46-2.23), hypertension: AORPri=1.94(1.60-2.36), diabetes: AORPri=4.94(3.55-6.87)] and serious infections [typhoid: AORPri=2.86(2.04-4.03)] were also more commonly treated by qualified private practitioners. Potential limitations included temporal ambiguity, reverse causation, generalizability issues and misclassification.In this poor-resource setting with high morbidity, ailments and their perceived severity were important predictors for healthcare-seeking. Interventions to improve awareness and healthcare-seeking among under-privileged and vulnerable population with efforts to improve the knowledge and practice of non-qualified practitioners probably required urgently."
https://openalex.org/W1652731649,"MiR-138 is frequently downregulated in different cancer types and is thought to be involved in the progression of tumorigenesis. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-138 involvement in gallbladder carcinoma still remains unknown.The expression of miR-138 in 49 gallbladder carcinoma samples and paired normal gallbladder samples was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The biological functions of miR-138 and Bag-1 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene-1) on cell proliferation were examined using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and apoptosis assays. Targets of miR-138 were predicted using bioinformatics and validated using luciferase reporter and Western blot analyses. The in vivo effects of miR-138 were examined using subcutaneous inoculation of gallbladder carcinoma cells in Balb/c nude mice.Compared with their paired normal gallbladder samples, the gallbladder carcinoma samples had decreased expression of miR-138 and increased expression of Bag-1. Overexpression of miR-138 inhibited the proliferation of gallbladder carcinoma cells. Bag-1 was defined as a novel target of miR-138. Both the inhibition of Bag-1 by miR-138 and the silencing of Bag-1 by siRNA led to alterations of apoptosis-related proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bax. Restoring expression of Bag-1 eliminates the effects of miR-138 on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-138 markedly inhibited the growth of tumors in the gallbladder carcinoma xenograft model in nude mice.Expression of miR-138 is frequently reduced in gallbladder carcinoma when compared to normal cells. Overexpression of miR-138 inhibited cell proliferation by directly suppressing the expression of Bag-1. These results suggest that miR-138 plays an important role in inhibiting the growth of gallbladder carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1950643791,"Physico-chemical properties of the mutations G34R, P39L and E41K in the N-terminal domain of human heat shock protein B1 (HspB1), which have been associated with hereditary motor neuron neuropathy, were analyzed. Heat-induced aggregation of all mutants started at lower temperatures than for the wild type protein. All mutations decreased susceptibility of the N- and C-terminal parts of HspB1 to chymotrypsinolysis. All mutants formed stable homooligomers with a slightly larger apparent molecular weight compared to the wild type protein. All mutations analyzed decreased or completely prevented phosphorylation-induced dissociation of HspB1 oligomers. When mixed with HspB6 and heated, all mutants yielded heterooligomers with apparent molecular weights close to ~400 kDa. Finally, the three HspB1 mutants possessed lower chaperone-like activity towards model substrates (lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase and insulin) compared to the wild type protein, conversely the environmental probe bis-ANS yielded higher fluorescence with the mutants than with the wild type protein. Thus, in vitro the analyzed N-terminal mutations increase stability of large HspB1 homooligomers, prevent their phosphorylation-dependent dissociation, modulate their interaction with HspB6 and decrease their chaperoning capacity, preventing normal functioning of HspB1."
https://openalex.org/W273247358,"Bats are likely natural hosts for a range of zoonotic viruses such as Marburg, Ebola, Rabies, as well as for various Corona- and Paramyxoviruses. In 2009/10, researchers discovered RNA of two novel influenza virus subtypes--H17N10 and H18N11--in Central and South American fruit bats. The identification of bats as possible additional reservoir for influenza A viruses raises questions about the role of this mammalian taxon in influenza A virus ecology and possible public health relevance. As molecular testing can be limited by a short time window in which the virus is present, serological testing provides information about past infections and virus spread in populations after the virus has been cleared. This study aimed at screening available sera from 100 free-ranging, frugivorous bats (Eidolon helvum) sampled in 2009/10 in Ghana, for the presence of antibodies against the complete panel of influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) types ranging from H1 to H18 by means of a protein microarray platform. This technique enables simultaneous serological testing against multiple recombinant HA-types in 5 μl of serum. Preliminary results indicate serological evidence against avian influenza subtype H9 in about 30% of the animals screened, with low-level cross-reactivity to phylogenetically closely related subtypes H8 and H12. To our knowledge, this is the first report of serological evidence of influenza A viruses other than H17 and H18 in bats. As avian influenza subtype H9 is associated with human infections, the implications of our findings from a public health context remain to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W337460994,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are genetic elements of prokaryotes which encode a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin that can counteract toxicity. TA systems residing on plasmids are often involved in episomal maintenance whereas those on chromosomes can have multiple functions. The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus possesses at least four different families of TA systems but their physiological roles are elusive. The chromosomal mazEF system encodes the RNase toxin MazF and the antitoxin MazE. In the light of ambiguity regarding the cleavage activity, we here verify that MazF specifically targets UACAU sequences in S. aureus in vivo. In a native strain background and under non-stress conditions, cleavage was observed in the absence or presence of mazE. Transcripts of spa (staphylococcal protein A) and rsbW (anti-σB factor) were cut, but translational reporter fusions indicated that protein levels of the encoded products were unaffected. Despite a comparable growth rate as the wild-type, an S. aureus mazEF deletion mutant was more susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, which suggests that further genes, putatively involved in the antibiotic stress response or cell wall synthesis or turnover, are controlled by this TA system."

Cognition was evaluated with the K-ABC, and behavior with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Primary outcomes were cognitive and behavioral scores, as well as neurodevelopmental impairment (cognitive score < 2SD, hearing loss, blindness, or cerebral palsy). The need of therapy, an indirect indicator of neurodevelopmental impairment, was a secondary outcome. Linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze the association of SGA with neurodevelopment.342/515 (76%) premature infants were assessed. SGA was significantly associated with hyperactivity scores of the SDQ (coefficient 0.81, p < 0.04), but not with cognitive scores, neurodevelopmental impairment or the need of therapy. Gestational age, socio-economic status, and major brain lesions were associated with cognitive outcome in the univariate and multivariate model, whereas asphyxia, sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were associated in the univariate model only. Severe impairment was associated with fetal tobacco exposition, asphyxia, gestational age and major brain lesions. Different neonatal factors were associated with the use of single or multiple therapies: children with one therapy were more likely to have suffered birth asphyxia or necrotizing enterocolitis, whereas the need for several therapies was predicted by major brain lesions.In this large cohort of premature infants, assessed at 5 years old with a complete panel of tests, SGA was associated with hyperactive behavior, but not with cognition, neurodevelopmental impairment or use of therapy. Birthweight <10th percentile alone does not appear to be an independent risk factor of neurodevelopmental adverse outcome in preterm children."
https://openalex.org/W391925564,"Cyclin B1, a mitotic cyclin, has been implicated in malignances. However, its contribution to colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis are still not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that the invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer is regulated by Cyclin B1. Overexpression of Cyclin B1 was observed in colorectal cancer tissues, but this elevated expression was negatively associated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis stage, and TNM stage. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis proved that low Cyclin B1 expression was associated with poor overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer. Inhibition of Cyclin B1 in colorectal cancer cells enhanced the cell migration and invasion of three different colorectal cancer cell lines. In studying the possible mechanism by which Cyclin B1 suppresses colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis, we observed that suppression of Cyclin B1 decreased the expression of E-cadherin protein level. Our findings suggest that Cyclin B1 could suppress the invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells through regulating E-cadherin expression, which enables the development of potential intervention strategies for colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W217654841,"Cryopreservation of mature oocytes and embryos has provided numerous benefits in reproductive medicine. Although successful cryopreservation of germinal-vesicle stage (GV) oocytes holds promise for further advances in reproductive biology and clinical embryology fields, reports regarding cryopreservation of immature oocytes are limited. Oocyte survival and maturation rates have improved since vitrification is being performed at the GV stage, but the subsequent developmental competence of GV oocytes is still low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementation of the maturation medium with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) modulators on the developmental competence of vitrified-warmed GV bovine oocytes. GV oocytes were vitrified-warmed and cultured to allow for oocyte maturation, and then parthenogenetically activated or fertilized in vitro. Our results indicate that addition of a cAMP modulator forskolin (FSK) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to the maturation medium significantly improved the developmental competence of vitrified-warmed GV oocytes. We also demonstrated that vitrification of GV oocytes led to a decline in cAMP levels and maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activity in the oocytes during the initial and final phases of maturation, respectively. Nevertheless, the addition of FSK or IBMX to the maturation medium significantly elevated cAMP levels and MPF activity during IVM. Taken together, our results suggest that the cryopreservation-associated meiotic and developmental abnormalities observed in GV oocytes may be ameliorated by an artificial increase in cAMP levels during maturation culture after warming."
https://openalex.org/W1667221857,"Biomarkers useful for diagnosis and evaluation of treatment for patients with Fabry disease are urgently needed. Recently, plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) and lyso-Gb3-related analogues have attracted attention as promising biomarkers of Fabry disease. However, the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues are extremely low or below the detection limits in some Fabry patients as well as in healthy subjects. In this paper, we introduce the novel application of a nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) system to the measurement of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in plasma. Nano-LC-MS/MS requires smaller amounts of samples and is more sensitive than conventional techniques. Using this method, we measured the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in 40 healthy subjects, 5 functional variants (males with E66Q), and various Fabry patients (9 classic Fabry males/9 mutations; 7 later-onset Fabry males/5 mutations; and 10 Fabry females/9 mutations). The results revealed that the mean lyso-Gb3 and lyso-Gb3(-2) concentrations in all the Fabry patient subgroups were statistically higher, especially in the classic Fabry males, than those in the functional variants and healthy subjects. The plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues in healthy subjects, functional variants, and some Fabry patients with specific mutations (R112H and M296I) that cannot be established by conventional techniques were successfully determined by means of nano-LC-MS/MS. The lyso-Gb3 and lyso-Gb3(-2) concentrations in male patients with these mutations were lower than those in most Fabry patients having other mutations, but higher than those in the functional variants and healthy subjects. This new method is expected to be useful for sensitive determination of the plasma concentrations of lyso-Gb3 and its analogues. This study also revealed that not only lyso-Gb3 but also lyso-Gb3(-2) in plasma is a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of Fabry disease."
https://openalex.org/W847474684,"mRNA is translated with a non-uniform speed that actively coordinates co-translational folding of protein domains. Using structure-based homology we identified the structural domains in epoxide hydrolases (EHs) and introduced slow-translating codons to delineate the translation of single domains. These changes in translation speed dramatically improved the solubility of two EHs of metagenomic origin in Escherichia coli. Conversely, the importance of transient attenuation for the folding, and consequently solubility, of EH was evidenced with a member of the EH family from Agrobacterium radiobacter, which partitions in the soluble fraction when expressed in E. coli. Synonymous substitutions of codons shaping the slow-transiting regions to fast-translating codons render this protein insoluble. Furthermore, we show that low protein yield can be enhanced by decreasing the free folding energy of the initial 5’-coding region, which can disrupt mRNA secondary structure and enhance ribosomal loading. This study provides direct experimental evidence that mRNA is not a mere messenger for translation of codons into amino acids but bears an additional layer of information for folding, solubility and expression level of the encoded protein. Furthermore, it provides a general frame on how to modulate and fine-tune gene expression of a target protein."

However, the outcomes of non-Chinese NPC patients in Singapore are not well reported.To determine if non-Chinese NPC patients have a different prognosis and examine the clinical outcomes of NPC patients in a multi-ethnic society.Retrospective chart review of 558 NPC patients treated at a single academic tertiary hospital from 2002 to 2012. Survival and recurrence rates were analysed and predictive factors identified using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model.Our cohort comprised 409 males (73.3%) and 149 females (26.7%) with a median age of 52 years. There were 476 Chinese (85.3%), 57 Malays (10.2%), and 25 of other ethnic groups (4.5%). Non-Chinese patients were more likely to be associated with advanced nodal disease at initial presentation (p = 0.049), compared with the Chinese. However, there were no statistical differences in their overall survival (OS) or disease specific survival (DSS) (p = 0.934 and p = 0.857 respectively). The 3-year and 5-year cohort OS and DSS rates were 79.3%, 70.7%, and 83.2%, 77.4% respectively. Advanced age (p<0.001), N2 disease (p = 0.036), N3 disease (p<0.001), and metastatic disease (p<0.001) at presentation were independently associated with poor overall survival. N2 disease (p = 0.032), N3 disease (p<0.001) and metastatic disease (p<0.001) were also independently associated with poor DSS. No predictive factors were associated with loco-regional recurrence after definitive treatment. Advanced age (p = 0.044), N2 disease (p = 0.033) and N3 disease (p<0.001) were independently associated with distant relapse.In a multi-ethnic society in Singapore, non-Chinese are more likely to present with advanced nodal disease. This however did not translate into poorer survival outcomes. Older patients with N2 or N3 disease are associated with a higher risk of distant relapse and poor overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W2161440756,"Airway epithelia express sialylated receptors that recognize exogenous danger signals. Regulation of receptor responsiveness to these signals remains incompletely defined. Here, we explore the mechanisms through which the human sialidase, neuraminidase-1 (NEU1), promotes the interaction between the sialoprotein, mucin 1 (MUC1), and the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa flagellin engaged the MUC1 ectodomain (ED), increasing NEU1 association with MUC1. The flagellin stimulus increased the association of MUC1-ED with both NEU1 and its chaperone/transport protein, protective protein/cathepsin A. Scatchard analysis demonstrated NEU1-dependent increased binding affinity of flagellin to MUC1-expressing epithelia. NEU1-driven MUC1-ED desialylation rapidly increased P. aeruginosa adhesion to and invasion of the airway epithelium. MUC1-ED desialylation also increased its shedding, and the shed MUC1-ED competitively blocked P. aeruginosa adhesion to cell-associated MUC1-ED. Levels of desialylated MUC1-ED were elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of mechanically ventilated patients with P. aeruginosa airway colonization. Preincubation of P. aeruginosa with these same ex vivo fluids competitively inhibited bacterial adhesion to airway epithelia, and MUC1-ED immunodepletion completely abrogated their inhibitory activity. These data indicate that a prokaryote, P. aeruginosa, in a ligand-specific manner, mobilizes eukaryotic NEU1 to enhance bacterial pathogenicity, but the host retaliates by releasing MUC1-ED into the airway lumen as a hyperadhesive decoy receptor.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, flagellated, and opportunistic human pathogen that typically colonizes and/or infects debilitated and immunocompromised patients (1Pier G.B. Ramphal R.

Adhesins and receptors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with infection of the respiratory tract.Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One P. aeruginosa adhesin, flagellin, is the structural protein that forms the major portion of the flagellar filament. Flagellin contributes to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria through increased motility, adhesion, and invasion (10Ramos H.C. Rumbo M. Sirard J.C.

MUC1 consists of a >250-kDa ectodomain (ED), with a variable number of highly sialylated tandem repeats, which is proteolytically processed and shed from the EC surface (13Lillehoj E.P. Kato K. Lu W.

Glycoprotein receptors for bacteria often contain glycan chains terminating with sialic acid (Sia). Here, Sia residues are strategically positioned to influence cell-cell and intermolecular interactions (17Schauer R. Sialic acids as regulators of molecular and cellular interactions.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Sia residues can mask binding sites for pathogens, their toxins, endogenous lectins, and protease recognition sites through protein conformational changes, electrostatic repulsion, and/or steric hindrance (18Lewis A.L. Lewis W.G. Host sialoglycans and bacterial sialidases: a mucosal perspective.Cell. Microbiol. 2012; 14: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The sialylation state of glycoconjugates is dynamically and coordinately regulated through the opposing catalytic activities of sialyltransferases and neuraminidases (NEU). NEUs constitute a large family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic glycolytic enzymes that hydrolyzes the linkages between Sia and its subterminal sugars (19Pshezhetsky A.V. Ashmarina L.I. Desialylation of surface receptors as a new dimension in cell signaling.Biochemistry. 2013; 78: 736-745PubMed Google Scholar). Prokaryotic NEUs are established virulence factors for viral and bacterial pathogens (18Lewis A.L. Lewis W.G. Host sialoglycans and bacterial sialidases: a mucosal perspective.Cell. Microbiol. 2012; 14: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa NEU, referred to as NanPs, contributes to bacterial pathogenesis and its expression has been linked to biofilm formation and airway colonization (20Soong G. Muir A. Gomez M.I. Waks J. Reddy B. Planet P. Singh P.K. Kaneko Y. Kanetko Y. Wolfgang M.C. Hsiao Y.S. Tong L. Prince A. Bacterial neuraminidase facilitates mucosal infection by participating in biofilm production.J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2297-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although much is known about prokaryotic NEUs as virulence factors, a role for mammalian host NEUs in bacterial pathogenesis, to our knowledge, has never been considered. Of the four known mammalian NEUs, NEU1 is the predominant sialidase expressed by human airway ECs, and the second most abundant, NEU3, is expressed at much lower levels (12Lillehoj E.P. Hyun S.W.

Chem. 2012; 287: 8214-8231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NEU1 is localized both to lysosomes and the cell surface (19Pshezhetsky A.V. Ashmarina L.I. Desialylation of surface receptors as a new dimension in cell signaling.Biochemistry. 2013; 78: 736-745PubMed Google Scholar) and is only active in association with its chaperone/transport protein, protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) (21Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 2017-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PPCA is a multipurpose protein that targets NEU1 to the lysosome and is absolutely required for proper folding, stability, oligomerization, and activation of NEU1 (21Bonten E.J. Annunziata I. d'Azzo A. Lysosomal multienzyme complex: pros and cons of working together.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 2017-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated intense NEU1 immunostaining at the superficial surface of the human airway epithelium, including the brush border of the trachea and bronchus (12Lillehoj E.P. Hyun S.W.

A periciliary brush promotes the lung health by separating the mucus layer from airway epithelia.Science. 2012; 337: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we established that forced NEU1 overexpression increases MUC1-ED desialylation and MUC1-ED-dependent P. aeruginosa adhesion to airway ECs in vitro (12Lillehoj E.P. Hyun S.W. Feng C. Zhang L. Liu A. Guang W. Nguyen C. Luzina I.G. Atamas S.P. Pasaniti A. Twaddell W.S. Puché A.C. Wang L.X. Cross A.S. Goldblum S.E.

Chem. 2012; 287: 8214-8231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To extend these findings to a physiologically relevant context, we asked whether the MUC1 ligand, P. aeruginosa flagellin, might promote NEU1-mediated MUC1-ED desialylation and/or P. aeruginosa adhesion to and invasion of airway ECs. We now present evidence, for the first time, that a bacterial pathogen, P. aeruginosa, exploits the human sialidase, NEU1, to amplify its own pathogenicity through desialylation of its receptor, MUC1. At the same time, NEU1-mediated desialylation of MUC1-ED increases its shedding into the airway lumen to generate a soluble, hyperadhesive decoy receptor for P. aeruginosa. That NEU1 can act on a range of sialylated glycans, not only mucin-type, O-linked glycans abundant in MUC1 but also sialylated N-linked glycan chains, may implicate other sites through which NEU1 might influence the P. aeruginosa-airway EC interaction.

HCV NS3 protein is one of the potent antigens of this virus mediating inflammatory response in different cell types. Microglia being the immune surveillance cells in the central nervous system (CNS), the inflammatory potential of NS3 on microglia was studied. Role of toll like receptor (TLR) ligands Pam2CSK3 and Pam3CSK4 in controlling the NS3 mediated microglial inflammation was studied using microglial cell line CHME3.IL (Interleukin)-8, IL-6, TNF-α (Tumor nicrosis factor alpha) and IL-1β gene expressions were measured by semi quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR). ELISA was performed to detect IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 secretion. FACS (Flourescent activated cell sorting) was performed to quantify TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, MyD88 (Myeloid differntiation factor 88), IkB-α (I kappaB alpha) and pNF-κB (phosphorylated nuclear factor kappaB) expression. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for MyD88, TLR6 and NF-κB (Nuclear factor kappaB). Student's t-test or One way analysis of variance with Bonferoni post hoc test was performed and p < 0.05 was considered significant.Microglia responded to NS3 by secreting IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β via TLR2 or TLR6 mediated MyD88/NF-κB pathway. Transcription factor NF-κB was involved in activating the cytokine gene expression and the resultant inflammatory response was controlled by NF-κB inhibitor, Ro106-9920, which is known to down regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Activation of the microglia by TLR agonists Pam3CSK4 and Pam2CSK4 induced immune tolerance against NS3. TLR ligand treatment significantly down regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the microglia. IL-10 secretion was suggested as the possible mechanism by which TLR agonists induced immune tolerance. NS3 as such was not capable of self-inducing immune tolerance in microglia.In conclusion, NS3 protein was capable of activating microglia and the inflammatory response could be controlled via blocking the transcription factor NF-κB, or by treating the microglia with TLR ligands which likely function via secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. This can have therapeutic potential in controlling HCV mediated neuroinflammation."
https://openalex.org/W299771174,"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes present in virtually all organisms. Besides having an essential role in cellular detoxification, they also perform various other functions, including responses in stress conditions and signaling. GSTs are highly studied in plants and animals; however, the knowledge regarding GSTs in cyanobacteria seems rudimentary. In this study, we report the characterization of a highly pH stable GST from the model cyanobacterium--Synechocystis PCC 6803. The gene sll0067 was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), and the protein was purified to homogeneity. The expressed protein exists as a homo-dimer, which is composed of about 20 kDa subunit. The results of the steady-state enzyme kinetics displayed protein's glutathione conjugation activity towards its class specific substrate- isothiocyanate, having the maximal activity with phenethyl isothiocyanate. Contrary to the poor catalytic activity and low specificity towards standard GST substrates such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene by bacterial GSTs, PmGST B1-1 from Proteus mirabilis, and E. coli GST, sll0067 has broad substrate degradation capability like most of the mammalian GST. Moreover, we have shown that cyanobacterial GST sll0067 is catalytically efficient compared to the best mammalian enzymes. The structural stability of GST was studied as a function of pH. The fluorescence and CD spectroscopy in combination with size exclusion chromatography showed a highly stable nature of the protein over a broad pH range from 2.0 to 11.0. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GST with such a wide range of pH related structural stability. Furthermore, the presence of conserved Proline-53, structural motifs such as N-capping box and hydrophobic staple further aid in the stability and proper folding of cyanobacterial GST-sll0067."
https://openalex.org/W295497567,"Eukaryotic cilia and flagella have highly conserved 9 + 2 structures. They are functionally diverged to play cell-type-specific roles even in a multicellular organism. Although their structural components are therefore believed to be common, few studies have investigated the molecular diversity of the protein components of the cilia and flagella in a single organism. Here we carried out a proteomic analysis and compared protein components between branchial cilia and sperm flagella in a marine invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis. Distinct feature of protein recruitment in branchial cilia and sperm flagella has been clarified; (1) Isoforms of α- and β-tubulins as well as those of actins are distinctly used in branchial cilia or sperm flagella. (2) Structural components, such as dynein docking complex, tektins and an outer dense fiber protein, are used differently by the cilia and flagella. (3) Sperm flagella are specialized for the cAMP- and Ca2+-dependent regulation of outer arm dynein and for energy metabolism by glycolytic enzymes. Our present study clearly demonstrates that flagellar or ciliary proteins are properly recruited according to their function and stability, despite their apparent structural resemblance and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2130317964,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-most common cause of cancer-related mortality. The most important prognostic factors are lymph node (LN) involvement and extranodal metastasis. Our objective is to investigate the interactions between CD133(+)CXCR4(+) (CXC receptor 4) colorectal cancer tumor-initiating cells (Co-TICs) and the LN stromal microenvironment in human CRC extranodal metastasis. We established a unique humanized orthotopic xenograft model. Luciferase-tagged CRC cell lines and human cancer cells were injected intrarectally into nonobese diabetic/SCID mice. Mesenteric LN stromal cells, stromal cell line HK, or CXCL12 knockdown HK (HK-KD-A3) cells were coinoculated with CRC cells. Tumor growth and metastasis were monitored by bioluminescent imaging and immunohistochemistry. We found that this model mimics the human CRC metastatic pattern with CRC cell lines or patient specimens. Adding LN stromal cells promotes CRC tumor growth and extranodal metastasis (P < 0.001). Knocking down CXCL12 impaired HK cell support of CRC tumor formation and extranodal metastasis. When HK cells were added, sorted CD133(+)CXCR4(+) Co-TICs showed increased tumor formation and extranodal metastasis capacities compared to unseparated and non-Co-TIC populations. In conclusion, both Co-TIC and LN stromal factors play crucial roles in CRC metastasis through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. Blocking Co-TIC/LN-stromal interactions may lead to effective therapy to prevent extranodal metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1535338082,"Microfluidic technologies enable in vitro studies to closely simulate in vivo microvessel environment with complexity. Such method overcomes certain constrains of the statically cultured endothelial monolayers and enables the cells grow under physiological range of shear flow with geometry similar to microvessels in vivo. However, there are still existing knowledge gaps and lack of convincing evidence to demonstrate and quantify key biological features of the microfluidic microvessels. In this paper, using advanced micromanufacturing and microfluidic technologies, we presented an engineered microvessel model that mimicked the dimensions and network structures of in vivo microvessels with a long-term and continuous perfusion capability, as well as high-resolution and real-time imaging capability. Through direct comparisons with studies conducted in intact microvessels, our results demonstrated that the cultured microvessels formed under perfused conditions recapitulated certain key features of the microvessels in vivo. In particular, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were successfully cultured the entire inner surfaces of the microchannel network with well-developed junctions indicated by VE-cadherin staining. The morphological and proliferative responses of endothelial cells to shear stresses were quantified under different flow conditions which was simulated with three-dimensional shear dependent numerical flow model. Furthermore, we successfully measured agonist-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and nitric oxide production at individual endothelial cell levels using fluorescence imaging. The results were comparable to those derived from individually perfused intact venules. With in vivo validation of its functionalities, our microfluidic model demonstrates a great potential for biological applications and bridges the gaps between in vitro and in vivo microvascular research."
https://openalex.org/W225692440,"The ability to discriminate between two similar or progressively dissimilar colours is important for many animals as it allows for accurately interpreting visual signals produced by key target stimuli or distractor information. Spectrophotometry objectively measures the spectral characteristics of these signals, but is often limited to point samples that could underestimate spectral variability within a single sample. Algorithms for RGB images and digital imaging devices with many more than three channels, hyperspectral cameras, have been recently developed to produce image spectrophotometers to recover reflectance spectra at individual pixel locations. We compare a linearised RGB and a hyperspectral camera in terms of their individual capacities to discriminate between colour targets of varying perceptual similarity for a human observer.(1) The colour discrimination power of the RGB device is dependent on colour similarity between the samples whilst the hyperspectral device enables the reconstruction of a unique spectrum for each sampled pixel location independently from their chromatic appearance. (2) Uncertainty associated with spectral reconstruction from RGB responses results from the joint effect of metamerism and spectral variability within a single sample.(1) RGB devices give a valuable insight into the limitations of colour discrimination with a low number of photoreceptors, as the principles involved in the interpretation of photoreceptor signals in trichromatic animals also apply to RGB camera responses. (2) The hyperspectral camera architecture provides means to explore other important aspects of colour vision like the perception of certain types of camouflage and colour constancy where multiple, narrow-band sensors increase resolution."
https://openalex.org/W437128071,"The surfactant protein (SP-A) receptor SP-R210 has been shown to increase phagocytosis of SP-A-bound pathogens and to modulate cytokine secretion by immune cells. SP-A plays an important role in pulmonary immunity by enhancing opsonization and clearance of pathogens and by modulating macrophage inflammatory responses. Alternative splicing of the Myo18A gene results in two isoforms: SP-R210S and SP-R210L, with the latter predominantly expressed in alveolar macrophages. In this study we show that SP-A is required for optimal expression of SP-R210L on alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, pre-treatment with SP-A prepared by different methods either enhances or suppresses responsiveness to LPS, possibly due to differential co-isolation of SP-B or other proteins. We also report that dominant negative disruption of SP-R210L augments expression of receptors including SR-A, CD14, and CD36, and enhances macrophages’ inflammatory response to TLR stimulation. Finally, because SP-A is known to modulate CD14, we used a variety of techniques to investigate how SP-R210 mediates the effect of SP-A on CD14. These studies revealed a novel physical association between SP-R210S, CD14, and SR-A leading to an enhanced response to LPS, and found that SP-R210L and SP-R210S regulate internalization of CD14 via distinct macropinocytosis-like mechanisms. Together, our findings support a model in which SP-R210 isoforms differentially regulate trafficking, expression, and activation of innate immune receptors on macrophages."

Cation uptake along with anion and water movement induces swelling if not compensated by other processes. For mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, these include activation of countertransporters (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Na+/H+ exchanger) coupled to the proton gradient, ultimately maintained by the proton pumps of the respiratory chain, and Ca2+ binding to matrix buffers. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is known to affect both the Ca2+ uptake rate and the buffering reaction, but the role of anion transport in determining mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics is poorly understood. Here we simultaneously monitor extra- and intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) to examine the effects of anion transport on mitochondrial Ca2+ flux and buffering in Pi-depleted guinea pig cardiac mitochondria. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake proceeded slowly in the absence of Pi but matrix free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]mito) still rose to ∼50 μm. Pi (0.001–1 mm) accelerated Ca2+ uptake but decreased [Ca2+]mito by almost 50% while restoring ΔΨm. Pi-dependent effects on Ca2+ were blocked by inhibiting the phosphate carrier. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake rate was also increased by vanadate (Vi), acetate, ATP, or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP), with differential effects on matrix Ca2+ buffering and ΔΨm recovery. Interestingly, ATP or AMP-PNP prevented the effects of Pi on Ca2+ uptake.

The 25 most promising compounds were all betulin derivatives. These were selected for a focused secondary screen in three-dimensional (3D) growth conditions, with the goal to identify the most effective and specific anti-invasive compounds. Additional sensitivity and cytotoxicity tests were then performed using an extended cell line panel. The effects of these compounds on cell cycle progression, mitosis, proliferation and unspecific cytotoxicity, versus their ability to specifically interfere with cell motility and tumor cell invasion was addressed. To identify potential mechanisms of action and likely compound targets, multiplex profiling of compound effects on a panel of 43 human protein kinases was performed. These target de-convolution studies, combined with the phenotypic analyses of multicellular organoids in 3D models, revealed specific inhibition of AKT signaling linked to effects on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton as the most likely driver of altered cell morphology and motility."
https://openalex.org/W853629770,"Nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco and it has a broad impact on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Over the past decades, an increasing number of genes potentially involved in nicotine addiction have been identified by different technical approaches. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction remain largely unclear. Under such situation, a comprehensive analysis focusing on the overall functional characteristics of these genes, as well as how they interact with each other will provide us valuable information to understand nicotine addiction. In this study, we presented a systematic analysis on nicotine addiction-related genes to identify the major underlying biological themes. Functional analysis revealed that biological processes and biochemical pathways related to neurodevelopment, immune system and metabolism were significantly enriched in the nicotine addiction-related genes. By extracting the nicotine addiction-specific subnetwork, a number of novel genes associated with addiction were identified. Moreover, we constructed a schematic molecular network for nicotine addiction via integrating the pathways and network, providing an intuitional view to understand the development of nicotine addiction. Pathway and network analysis indicated that the biological processes related to nicotine addiction were complex. Results from our work may have important implications for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying nicotine addiction."

Type I RNases H are thought to recognize and cleave the RNA/DNA duplex when at least four ribonucleotides are present. Here we investigated the importance of RNase H type I encoding genes for model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis. By performing gene replacement through homologous recombination, we demonstrate that each of the two presumable RNase H type I encoding genes, rnhA and MSMEG4305, can be removed from M. smegmatis genome without affecting the growth rate of the mutant. Further, we demonstrate that deletion of both RNases H type I encoding genes in M. smegmatis leads to synthetic lethality. Finally, we question the possibility of existence of RNase HI related alternative mode of initiation of DNA replication in M. smegmatis, the process initially discovered in Escherichia coli. We suspect that synthetic lethality of double mutant lacking RNases H type I is caused by formation of R-loops leading to collapse of replication forks. We report Mycobacterium smegmatis as the first bacterial species, where function of RNase H type I has been found essential."

We evaluated the clinical information of MG and fractures, bone markers, and radiological assessment. Quality of life was measured using an MG-specific battery, MG-QOL15.Glucocorticoids were administered in 283 (78%) of 363 MG patients. Eighteen (6%) of 283 MG patients treated with prednisolone had a history of osteoporotic fractures. The duration of glucocorticoid therapy, but not the dose of prednisolone, was associated with the osteoporotic fractures in MG patients. Bone mineral density was significantly decreased in the MG patients with fractures. The multivariate analyses showed that the total quantitative MG score was the only independent factor associated with osteoporotic fractures (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.02-1.67, p = 0.03). MG patients who had experienced fractures reported more severe difficulties in activities of daily living.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis aggravates quality of life in patients with MG."
https://openalex.org/W302594289,"Exercise has been shown to induce the translocation of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), a fatty acid transport protein, to both plasma and mitochondrial membranes. While previous studies have examined signals involved in the induction of FAT/CD36 translocation to sarcolemmal membranes, to date the signaling events responsible for FAT/CD36 accumulation on mitochondrial membranes have not been investigated. In the current study muscle contraction rapidly increased FAT/CD36 on plasma membranes (7.5 minutes), while in contrast, FAT/CD36 only increased on mitochondrial membranes after 22.5 minutes of muscle contraction, a response that was exercise-intensity dependent. Considering that previous research has shown that AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) α2 is not required for FAT/CD36 translocation to the plasma membrane, we investigated whether AMPK α2 signaling is necessary for mitochondrial FAT/CD36 accumulation. Administration of 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) induced AMPK phosphorylation, and resulted in FAT/CD36 accumulation on SS mitochondria, suggesting AMPK signaling may mediate this response. However, SS mitochondrial FAT/CD36 increased following acute treadmill running in both wild-type (WT) and AMPKα 2 kinase dead (KD) mice. These data suggest that AMPK signaling is not required for SS mitochondrial FAT/CD36 accumulation. The current data also implicates alternative signaling pathways that are exercise-intensity dependent, as IMF mitochondrial FAT/CD36 content only occurred at a higher power output. Taken altogether the current data suggests that activation of AMPK signaling is sufficient but not required for exercise-induced accumulation in mitochondrial FAT/CD36."
https://openalex.org/W337742293,"Background Independence and frequency are two distinct dimensions of participation in daily life. The gap between independence and frequency may reflect the role of the environment on participation, but this distinction has not been fully explored. Methods A total of 18,119 parents or primary caregivers of children with disabilities aged 6.0-17.9 years were interviewed in a cross-sectional nationwide survey with the Functioning Scale of the Disability Evaluation System - Child version (FUNDES-Child). A section consisting of 20 items measured the children’s daily participation in 4 environmental settings: home, neighborhood/community, school, and home/community. Higher independence and frequency restriction scores indicated greater limitation of participation in daily activities. Scores for independence, frequency and independence-frequency gaps were examined across ages along with trend analysis. ANOVA was used to compare the gaps across settings and diagnoses for children with mild levels of severity of impairment. Findings A negative independence-frequency gap (restriction of frequency was greater than that of independence) was found for children with mild to severe levels of impairment. A positive gap (restriction of independence was greater than that of frequency) was found for children with profound levels of severity. The gaps became wider with age in most settings of children with mild impairment and different diagnoses. Widest negative gaps were found for the neighborhood/community settings than for the other three settings for children with mild to severe impairment. Conclusions Children’s participation and independence-frequency gaps depend not only on the severity of their impairments or diagnoses, but also on their age, the setting and the support provided by their environment. In Taiwan, more frequency restrictions than ability restrictions were found for children with mild to moderate severity, especially in the neighborhood/community setting, and increased with age. Further identification of environmental opportunities that positively impact frequency of participation is needed."

The aim of the study was to quantitatively analyze several sources of errors when T1 maps are derived using standard post-processing of the sequence and to propose a reconstruction approach that takes into account inversion efficacy (η), T2 relaxation during balanced steady-state free-precession readouts and B1+ inhomogeneities. Contributions of the different sources of error were analyzed using Bloch equations simulations of MOLLI sequence. Bloch simulations were then combined with the acquisition of fast B1+ and T2 maps to derive more accurate T1 maps. This novel approach was evaluated on phantoms and on five healthy volunteers. Simulations show that T2 variations, B1+ heterogeneities and inversion efficiency represent major confounders for T1 mapping when MOLLI is processed with standard 3-parameters fitting. In vitro data indicate that T1 values are accurately derived with the simulation approach and in vivo data suggest that myocardium T1 are 15% underestimated when processed with the standard 3-parameters fitting. At the cost of additional acquisitions, this method might be suitable in clinical research protocols for precise tissue characterization as it decorrelates T1 and T2 effects on parametric maps provided by MOLLI sequence and avoids inaccuracies when B1+ is not homogenous throughout the myocardium."

A crisis of interpersonal trust exists in China, extending throughout multiple social spheres, including the healthcare system. At the same time, with increased migration from Africa to China in the last two decades, Chinese physicians must establish mutual trust with an increasingly diverse patient population. We undertook a qualitative study to identify factors affecting African migrants’ trust in Chinese physicians and to identify potential mechanisms for promoting trust. Methods / Principal Findings We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 40 African migrants in Guangzhou, China. A modified version of the social ecological model was used as a theoretical framework. At the patient-physician level, interpersonal treatment, technical competence, perceived commitment and motive, and language concordance were associated with enhanced trust. At the health system level, two primary factors influenced African migrants’ trust in their physicians: the fee-for-service payment system and lack of continuity with any one physician. Patients’ social networks and the broader socio-cultural context of interactions between African migrants and Chinese locals also influenced patients’ trust of their physicians. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the importance of factors beyond the immediate patient-physician interaction and suggest opportunities to promote trust through health system interventions."

Fetal membranes were collected immediately after delivery and underwent histological staging for inflammation to derive 3 groups; term spontaneous labour without HCA (n = 9), preterm birth <34 weeks gestation without HCA (n = 8) and pHCA <34 weeks (n = 12). Profiling arrays ran in triplicate for each group were used to determine the expression of 84 genes associated with TLR signalling and screen for genes of interest (fold change >2; p<0.1). Expression of identified genes was validated individually for all samples, relative to GAPDH, using RT-PCR. Expression of TLR 1, TLR 2, lymphocyte antigen 96, interleukin 8 and Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-like 2 was increased in pHCA (p<0.05). Degree of expression was positively associated with histological staging of both maternal and fetal inflammation (p<0.05). The inflammatory expression profile at the maternal/fetal interface associated with pHCA, a reflection of ascending infection, is extremely heterogeneous suggesting polymicrobial involvement with activation of a common pathway.

https://openalex.org/W775311238,"Background Gastric ulcerations in the region of antrum pylori represent a serious medical problem in humans and animals. Such localization of ulcers can influence the intrinsic descending nerve supply to the pyloric sphincter. The pyloric function is precisely regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic nerves. Impaired neural regulation could result in pyloric sphincter dysfunction and gastric emptying malfunction. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of gastric antral ulcerations on the density and distribution of intramural gastric descending neurons supplying the pyloric sphincter in pigs. Methodology/Principal Findings The experiment was performed on 2 groups of pigs: healthy gilts (n=6) and gilts with experimentally induced peptic ulcers in the region of antrum pylori (n=6). Gastric neurons supplying pyloric sphincter were labeled using the retrograde neuronal tracing technique (20μl of Fast Blue tracer injected into the pyloric sphincter muscle). After a week survival period the animals were sacrificed and the stomachs were collected. Then, the stomach wall was cross-cut into 0.5cm thick sections taken in specified intervals (section I - 1.5cm; section II - 3.5cm; section III - 5.5cm; section IV – 7.5cm) starting from the sphincter. Consecutive microscopic slices prepared from each section were analyzed under fluorescent microscope to count traced neurons. Obtained data were statistically analyzed. The total number of FB-positive perikarya observed within all studied sections significantly decreased from 903.3 ± 130.7 in control to 243.8 ± 67.3 in experimental animals. In healthy pigs 76.1 ± 6.7% of labeled neurons were observed within the section I, 23.53 ± 6.5% in section II and only occasional cells in section III. In experimental animals, as many as 93.8 ± 2.1% of labeled cells were observed within the section I and only 6.2 ± 2.2% in section II, while section III was devoid of such neurons. There were no traced perikarya in section IV observed in both groups of pigs. Conclusions/Significance Obtained results revealed for the first time significant impact of antral ulcerations on intramural descending nerve pathways supplying the pyloric sphincter in pigs, animals of increasing value in biomedical research and great economic importance."
https://openalex.org/W285889497,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an important tool for understanding bio-molecules in microscopic temporal/spatial scales. Besides the demand in improving simulation techniques to approach experimental scales, it becomes more and more crucial to develop robust methodology for precisely and objectively interpreting massive MD simulation data. In our previous work [J Phys Chem B 114, 10266 (2010)], the trajectory mapping (TM) method was presented to analyze simulation trajectories then to construct a kinetic transition network of metastable states. In this work, we further present a top-down implementation of TM to systematically detect complicate features of conformational space. We first look at longer MD trajectory pieces to get a coarse picture of transition network at larger time scale, and then we gradually cut the trajectory pieces in shorter for more details. A robust clustering algorithm is designed to more effectively identify the metastable states and transition events. We applied this TM method to detect the hierarchical structure in the conformational space of alanine-dodeca-peptide from microsecond to nanosecond time scales. The results show a downhill folding process of the peptide through multiple pathways. Even in this simple system, we found that single common-used order parameter is not sufficient either in distinguishing the metastable states or predicting the transition kinetics among these states."

We carried out pre-steady-state kinetic analysis to elucidate the kinetic mechanism of this enzyme. We found that the mechanism consists of seven steps, similar that of other A-family polymerases. pol ν binds to DNA with a Kd for DNA of 9.2 nm, with an off-rate constant of 0.013 s−1and an on-rate constant of 14 μm−1 s−1. dNTP binding is rapid with Kd values of 20 and 476 μm for the correct and incorrect dNTP, respectively. Pyrophosphorylation occurs with a Kd value for PPi of 3.7 mm and a maximal rate constant of 11 s−1. Pre-steady-state kinetics, examination of the elemental effect using dNTPαS, and pulse-chase experiments indicate that a rapid phosphodiester bond formation step is flanked by slow conformational changes for both correct and incorrect base pair formation. These experiments in combination with computer simulations indicate that the first conformational change occurs with rate constants of 75 and 20 s−1; rapid phosphodiester bond formation occurs with a Keq of 2.2 and 1.7, and the second conformational change occurs with rate constants of 2.1 and 0.5 s−1, for correct and incorrect base pair formation, respectively.

There is evidence that pol ν functions in cross-link repair and/or homologous recombination. For instance, mutations in mus308, the Drosophila ortholog of pol ν, cause hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents (nitrogen mustard and cisplatin) but not methyl methanesulfonate (5Boyd J.B.

Although the A-family polymerases have sequence similarities, differences in sequence provide specialized functions. For instance, E. coli pol I is a high fidelity polymerase with a 3′- to 5′-exonuclease proofreading activity as well as a 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity. These activities let E. coli pol I function in Okazaki fragment synthesis as well as DNA repair in E. coli. pol γ is a multisubunit protein with high fidelity polymerase, 3′- to 5′-exonuclease proofreading, and 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activities that enable pol γ to be the sole polymerase responsible for the replication, recombination, and repair of mitochondrial DNA (23Graziewicz M.A. Longley M.J.

The mechanism consists of seven steps shown in Fig. 1A, in which phosphodiester bond formation, step 4, is flanked by conformational changes that are rate-limiting. Upon binding the correct dNTP, the polymerase is able to form an active conformation that catalyzes phosphodiester bond formation rapidly. When an incorrect dNTP binds, the enzyme is unable to adopt the highly catalytic conformation, and phosphodiester bond formation becomes rate-limiting (11Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A.

In this study, we evaluated the kinetic mechanism of pol ν and found that similar to KF and T7 pol, pol ν catalyzes correct base pair formation with a rapid phosphodiester bond formation step. In contrast to its high fidelity cousins, pol ν catalyzes mispair formation via the same mechanism. Despite the binding of the wrong dNTP, the enzyme is able to form a high catalytic conformation. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]dATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and T4 polynucleotide kinase was from USB®/Affymetrix. The dNTPs (ultrapure grade) were purchased from GE Healthcare, and the concentrations were determined by UV absorbance (31Dunn D.B. Hall R.H. Fasman G.D.

Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized at the Macromolecular Core Facility at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. The sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides are shown in Table 1.

The protein has a deletion of a C-terminal polyproline segment, an N-terminal His tag, and C-terminal FLAG tag. After lysing the cells, the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (3 ml), and the enzyme was eluted with an imidazole gradient. Purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by the Qubit protein assay kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). All assays with pol ν were performed in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. The concentrations reported for each species are those that occurred during the reaction. The reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP containing MgCl2 to preincubated protein and DNA in buffer. Steady-state reactions were quenched with equal volumes of STOP solution containing 10% 0.5 m Na2EDTA, 90% formamide, and 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue. Fast reactions were carried out with an RQF-3 quench flow apparatus (KinTek) and were quenched with 0.3 m Na2EDTA, which was diluted with STOP solution to load onto the gel. The progress of the reaction was analyzed by denaturing PAGE, and the radioactivity on the gel was visualized with a Typhoon 9200 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). The reactions were quantitated by dividing the total radioactivity in the product band(s) by the radioactivity in the product and reactant bands. The binding affinity of the DNA to the polymerase was evaluated with fluorescence anisotropy. The DNA (1 nm) consisted of the primer strand modified on the 5′-end with 6-carboxyfluorescein and the template strand containing dG. The fluorescence anisotropy was measured with 0–100 nm pol ν at 37 °C using a Tecan Safire 2 plate reader with half-volume 96-well plates. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 471 and 525 nm, respectively, with an emission bandwidth of 20 nm. The kinetic constants were fit using GraphPad Prism Version 6. Computer simulations were performed with DynaFit Version 4 (BioKin Ltd.) (33Kuzmic P. DynaFit–a software package for enzymology.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 467: 247-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The His tag pol ν was purified with an imidazole gradient on an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. From a 2-liter incubation, we obtained 2 ml of 990 nm protein. The active site concentration of pol ν was determined by measuring the burst amplitude of a reaction containing an excess of DNA and a saturating concentration of dNTP. As shown in Fig. 2, the reaction could be fit to Equation 1, P=A(1−e−kft)+kst(Eq. 1) where P is the concentration of the products; A is the burst amplitude; kf is the rate constant of the fast phase, and ks the steady-state rate constant. The burst amplitude of 6 ± 2 nm agreed with the protein concentration of 6.6 nm determined spectrophotometrically. The burst rate constant was >100 s−1 indicating that the polymerase has high catalytic activity. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters determined with pol ν and the P15/T24 DNA substrate are shown in Table 2. The DNA sequence was chosen because we previously used this sequence to examine the reactivity of KF (32Meyer A.S. Blandino M. Spratt T.E.

The purine triphosphates were incorporated about 10-fold less readily. The differences in kcat/Km values are driven by both the kcat and Km parameters. These numbers are consistent with the reports that pol ν is a low fidelity enzyme that is especially poor at discrimination against the incorporation of dT opposite dG in select sequences.TABLE 2Steady-state parameters for the pol ν-catalyzed insertion opposite dGdNTPkcatKmkcat/Kmfincs−1μms−1 m−1dATP0.0012 ± 0.0001300 ± 5642 ± 30.021 ± 0.005dCTP0.020 ± 0.00211 ± 31950 ± 4201dGTP0.0088 ± 0.0012146 ± 4963 ± 120.033 ± 0.009dTTP0.0085 ± 0.000524 ± 1350 ± 200.18 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab Steady-state kinetic analysis does not provide insights into intermediates in the reaction pathway of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This is especially true of DNA polymerases because under conditions in which the DNA is in excess over the polymerase, the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of the DNA from the polymerase. Thus, to more fully explore the mechanisms by which pol ν catalyzes DNA replication, we performed pre-steady-state kinetic experiments. We carried out single-turnover reactions by preincubating 15 nm DNA with 150 nm polymerase and initiating the reaction by the addition of dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2. The resulting time courses at different dNTP concentrations are shown in Fig. 3. The incorporation of dCTP (Fig. 3B) is much more rapid than the incorrect dNTPs. For example, at a dNTP concentration of 100 μm, the half-life for the reaction of dCTP was 0.013 s, whereas that for incorrect dNTPs was ∼6.5 s, a 500-fold difference. This discrimination differs from the relative kcat/Km ratios that range from 5 to 50. In these single-turnover reactions, we do not observed a preference for dTTP incorporation over dATP or dGTP. The time courses exhibited biphasic kinetics in which a rapid reaction was followed by a slower reaction. The time courses were initially fit to Equation 1. The amplitude (A) and burst rate constant k were dependent on the dNTP concentrations, whereas the steady-state rate constant (ks) was not. The resulting amplitudes and burst rate constants are plotted against dNTP concentration in Fig. 4. These values were fitted to a hyperbola (Equation 2) in which V is the value of the parameter at a specific [dNTP]. From these plots, we obtained the following: Amax, the maximum amplitude; KA, the [dNTP] at 50% of Amax; kpol, the maximum burst rate constant and the apparent dissociation constant of the dNTP, and Kdapp for dNTP. These parameters as well as the ks from the initial fitting are presented in Table 3. The kpol for the incorporation of the correct dCTP is 100 ± 8 s−1.

The Kdapp value for dNTP was lower for the correct dCTP (4.3 μm) than for the incorrect dNTPs (140–290 μm) by a factor of 30–70. The apparent Kdapp values for dNTP for the correct and incorrect dNTPs are similar to those found for KF and T7 pol. The burst amplitude was also dependent on the dNTP concentration. The maximum amplitude (Amax) for all four dNTPs were similar, ranging from 10 to 13 nm. The KA value is lower for the correct dCTP (20 μm) that the incorrect dNTPs (140–440 μm). In summary, dCTP is favored over the incorrect dNTPs by a higher kpol, and lower Kdapp for dNTP and KA values. In contrast to the steady-state experiments, we do not observe a preference of dTTP over dATP and dGTP. The dNTP concentration dependence on the burst amplitude was not observed for KF and T7 pol. In this respect, pol ν is unique in A-family polymerases and indicates a difference in mechanism. In subsequent experiments, we considered two possible mechanisms illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, to explain the [dNTP]-dependent decrease in burst amplitude. Fig. 1A is the seven-step mechanism that has been found for KF and T7 pol. It consists of conformational changes prior to and after phosphodiester bond formation. This mechanism would produce a dNTP-dependent burst if step 5 was rate-limiting. The mechanism in Fig. 1B contains an inactive complex and would produce a decreased burst if the inactive complex is stable such that k−8 or k−9 val"
https://openalex.org/W1586059623,"A commonly used paradigm to study motor imagery is the hand laterality judgment task. The present study aimed to determine which strategies young children employ to successfully perform this task. Children of 5 to 8 years old (N = 92) judged laterality of back and palm view hand pictures in different rotation angles. Response accuracy and response duration were registered. Response durations of the trials with a correct judgment were fitted to a-priori defined predictive sinusoid models, representing different strategies to successfully perform the hand laterality judgment task. The first model predicted systematic changes in response duration as a function of rotation angle of the displayed hand. The second model predicted that response durations are affected by biomechanical constraints of hand rotation. If observed data could be best described by the first model, this would argue for a mental imagery strategy that does not involve motor processes to solve the task. The second model reflects a motor imagery strategy to solve the task. In line with previous research, we showed an age-related increase in response accuracy and decrease in response duration in children. Observed data for both back and palm view showed that motor imagery strategies were used to perform hand laterality judgments, but that not all the children use these strategies (appropriately) at all times. A direct comparison of response duration patterns across age sheds new light on age-related differences in the strategies employed to solve the task. Importantly, the employment of the motor imagery strategy for successful task performance did not change with age."
https://openalex.org/W339609100,"Aim The present study attempted to test McCullough and Willoughby’s hypothesis that self-control mediates the relationships between religiosity and psychosocial outcomes. Specifically, this study examined whether trait self-control (TSC) mediates the relationship of identified-introjected religiosity with positive and negative health-related-feelings (HRF) in healthy Muslims. Methods Two hundred eleven French-speaking participants (116 females, 95 males; Mage = 28.15, SDage = 6.90) answered questionnaires. One hundred ninety participants were retained for the analyses because they reported to be healthy (105 females, 85 males; Mage = 27.72, SDage = 6.80). To examine the relationships between religiosity, TSC and HRF, two competing mediation models were tested using structural equation model analysis: While a starting model used TSC as mediator of the religiosity-HRF relationship, an alternative model used religiosity as mediator of the TSC-HRF relationship. Results The findings revealed that TSC mediated the relationship between identified religiosity and positive HRF, and that identified religiosity mediated the relationship between TSC and positive and negative HRF, thereby validating both models. Moreover, the comparison of both models showed that the starting model explained 13.211% of the variance (goodness of fit = 1.000), whereas the alternative model explained 6.877% of the variance (goodness of fit = 0.987). Conclusion These results show that the starting model is the most effective model to account for the relationships between religiosity, TSC, and HRF. Therefore, this study provides initial insights into how religiosity influences psychological health through TSC. Important practical implications for the religious education are suggested."

Stem segments with one node (SN explants) from embryo-cultured seedlings (EC seedlings) were used as explants. Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2.0 mg/L 6-benzyladenine was used to induce cotyledonary embryo germination. This medium was also used for EC seedlings propagation and adventitious bud induction from SN explants. Regenerated plantlets were cultured on hormone-free MS medium for elongation and root induction. The regeneration capability of SN explants was compared by using EC seedling lines established in this research. EC seedling line EL6 exhibited the highest adventitious bud induction frequency (91.7%) and the highest number of buds per responding explant (5.2), which was considered as the most efficient EC seedling line for further gene transformation research."
https://openalex.org/W2164481705,"Epigenetic research leads to complex data structures. Since parametric model assumptions for the distribution of epigenetic data are hard to verify we introduce in the present work a nonparametric statistical framework for two-group comparisons. Furthermore, epigenetic analyses are often performed at various genetic loci simultaneously. Hence, in order to be able to draw valid conclusions for specific loci, an appropriate multiple testing correction is necessary. Finally, with technologies available for the simultaneous assessment of many interrelated biological parameters (such as gene arrays), statistical approaches also need to deal with a possibly unknown dependency structure in the data. Our statistical approach to the nonparametric comparison of two samples with independent multivariate observables is based on recently developed multivariate multiple permutation tests. We adapt their theory in order to cope with families of hypotheses regarding relative effects. Our results indicate that the multivariate multiple permutation test keeps the pre-assigned type I error level for the global null hypothesis. In combination with the closure principle, the family-wise error rate for the simultaneous test of the corresponding locus/parameter-specific null hypotheses can be controlled. In applications we demonstrate that group differences in epigenetic data can be detected reliably with our methodology."

In this study, we evaluated optic nerve impairment in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) using DTI. Methodology/Principal Findings Optic nerve DTI were performed on 28 NMO patients and 38 normal controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the intraorbital optic nerve segment. For the posterior intraorbital optic nerve, FA values of BI (0.20±0.07), MI (0.24±0.16), and NA (0.25±0.14) decreased significantly compared with that of NC (0.43±0.07) (P<0.05), and ROC analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) measurements for BI vs. NC, MI vs. NC, NA vs. NC, and NMO (including BI, MI, and NA) vs. NC were 0.99, 0.93, 0.88, and 0.96, respectively. The corresponding diagnostic sensitivities of ROC analysis were 100%, 80%, 80%, and 91%; and the specificities were 93%, 97%, 91%, and 93%. Conclusions/Significance Decreased FA value in the intraorbital optic nerve, especially in the posterior part of the nerve, was demonstrated as a characteristic MR feature for NMO-related optic nerve impairment."
https://openalex.org/W933757844,"Experiments in which the effect of combined manipulations is compared with the effects of their pure constituents have received a great deal of attention. Examples include the study of combination therapies and the comparison of double and single knockout model organisms. Often the effect of the combined manipulation is not a mere addition of the effects of its constituents, with quite different forms of interplay between the constituents being possible. Yet, a well-formalized taxonomy of possible forms of interplay is lacking, let alone a statistical methodology to test for their presence in empirical data.Starting from a taxonomy of a broad range of forms of interplay between constituents of a combined manipulation, we propose a sound statistical hypothesis testing framework to test for the presence of each particular form of interplay. We illustrate the framework with analyses of public gene expression data on the combined treatment of dendritic cells with curdlan and GM-CSF and show that these lead to valuable insights into the mode of action of the constituent treatments and their combination.R code implementing the statistical testing procedure for microarray gene expression data is available as supplementary material.

https://openalex.org/W387256391,"In the antennal lobe of the noctuid moth Agrotis ipsilon, most pheromone-sensitive projection neurons (PNs) exhibit a triphasic firing pattern of excitation (E1)-inhibition (I)-excitation (E2) in response to a pulse of the sex pheromone. To understand the mechanisms underlying this stereotypical discharge, we developed a biophysical model of a PN receiving inputs from olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) via nicotinic cholinergic synapses. The ORN is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose firing rate is a function of time and is fitted to extracellular data recorded in response to pheromone stimulations at various concentrations and durations. The PN model is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with realistic ionic currents whose parameters were derived from previous studies. Simulations revealed that the inhibitory phase I can be produced by a SK current (Ca2+-gated small conductance K+ current) and that the excitatory phase E2 can result from the long-lasting response of the ORNs. Parameter analysis further revealed that the ending time of E1 depends on some parameters of SK, Ca2+, nACh and Na+ currents; I duration mainly depends on the time constant of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, conductance of Ca2+ currents and some parameters of nACh currents; The mean firing frequency of E1 and E2 depends differentially on the interaction of various currents. Thus it is likely that the interplay between PN intrinsic currents and feedforward synaptic currents are sufficient to generate the triphasic firing patterns observed in the noctuid moth A. ipsilon."
