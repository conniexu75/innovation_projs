https://openalex.org/W1480527855,"Abstract Escherichia coli K-12 were treated in five ways to alter DNA synthesis, cell division, or both. Their membranes were then examined for changes. The bacteria were grown in the presence of radioactive l-arginine to label the membranes. 14C-Arginine was used for the experimental culture and 3H-arginine for the control, or vice versa. The cells were mixed, and their membranes were isolated and run on acrylamide gels in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate to obtain a spectrum of proteins. Gel fractions were counted for both labels in order to find differences caused by the experimental treatment. Two principal changes were found in the membranes. At a position Y, corresponding to molecular weight 34,000, less protein appeared whenever DNA synthesis was inhibited. At a position X, molecular weight 39,000, extra protein appeared whenever bacterial division was inhibited. Rates of changes of Y and X were examined during thymidine deprivation to stop DNA synthesis, and after restoration of thymidine. Whereas DNA synthesis was rapidly affected, the changes of Y were gradual, suggesting that Y is not responsible for the synthesis of DNA; rather, its slowed rate of formation might be a consequence of arrested DNA synthesis. Changes of X were more immediate, and could possibly be responsible for altered cell division which is only affected after a lag. No significant changes in synthesis of X and Y were noted between cells near the beginning and end of the division cycle, suggesting that these proteins are normally made continuously or are not produced under normal conditions. Pulse chase experiments indicated that X and Y do not have a precursor-product relation. This is also suggested by the kinetic studies. Temperature-sensitive changes of membrane proteins in a previously described temperature-sensitive DNA synthesis mutant were further examined. The mutation appears to influence the formation of Y indirectly by stopping DNA synthesis. But production of X in the absence of DNA synthesis was much less in the mutant than in the wild type, which is compatible with ability of the mutant to divide even in the absence of DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1520035784,A new method for the assay of polynucleotide joining activity is described; it measures the conversion of 3H-labeled d(A-T) copolymer with 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphoryl termini to a form resistant to exonuclease III. The method is rapid and precise and is suitable for assay of crude cell extracts. The product of the action of joining enzyme on the d(A-T) copolymer has the properties of a circular molecule. The optimal chain length of the d(A-T)n substrate is approximately 1000 nucleotides.

Eighty percent of the treated animals developed circulating endothelial cells, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia, and 50 percent had aortic endothelial lesions as determined by electron microscopy. Prior anticoagulation with heparin did not prevent this response. No control animals showed these abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1591911256,"Abstract Each of the three polypeptide chains of the catalytic subunit (CSU) of aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli has a single —SH group and no disulfides. Although the —SH group is unreactive toward several S-alkylating agents and symmetrical disulfides, it reacts slowly with 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. CSU is inactivated by these reagents and also, transiently, by inorganic polysulfides. Kinetic studies of the reaction with DTNB show (a) that DTNB does not bind to CSU as a prerequisite for reaction, (b) that reaction depends on the ionization of a group on the enzyme with apparent pKa = 7.9, probably the —SH group, and (c) that inhibitors of enzymatic activity also inhibit reaction of the —SH group with both DTNB and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. Dissociation constants for phosphate and succinate determined from inhibition of the DTNB reaction agree with those previously determined by steady state kinetics and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. Undissociated native aspartate transcarbamylase does not react with DTNB under conditions which lead to complete reaction of CSU. Treatment of the CSU-thionitrobenzoate mixed disulfide with nucleophiles such as cyanide, sulfite, and 2-mercapto-ethanol leads to new S- derivatives of CSU. The S-cyano derivative is fully active, but the S-sulfo and S-2-mercapto-ethanol derivatives have little or no activity. We conclude that the —SH group of CSU is very near the active site but is not required for catalytic activity and discuss possible alternative functions for this group. We also discuss the general use of enzyme-thionitro-benzoate mixed disulfides as intermediates in the preparation of specific derivatives of enzyme —SH groups and the potential use of enzyme thiocyanates, prepared through the thionitrobenzoate disulfides, in specific chemical cleavage of polypeptide chains at cysteine and cystine residues."

In the absence of BCG the tumor grows progressively, metastasizes, and kills the animal. By conventional methods, it has not been possible to immunize syngeneic guinea pigs to the tumor used. Guinea pigs that receive mixtures of BCG and tumor cells, however, develop specific systemic tumor immunity as measured by delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity and by suppression of tumor growth."

https://openalex.org/W1609878486,"Abstract Purification of l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli B is described. The enzyme is crystallized from a partially purified preparation in the presence of cations and aqueous alcohol. Effective crystallization requires a minimum of 4 g atoms of cation to each mole of protein. The crystalline l-asparaginase is homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation and has a sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) of 7.6 S and a molecular weight (by sedimentation equilibrium) of 133,000 ± 5,000. On gel electrophoresis, the crystalline enzyme migrates similarly to the enzyme present in cell-free extracts. The affinity constants for l-asparagine and l-glutamine are 1.15 x 10-5 and 6.25 x 10-3 m, respectively. The amino acid composition indicates a minimum molecular weight of 33,300. The crystalline enzyme has an E1%278 of 7.1 and a specific activity of 300 ± 15 I.U. per mg, corrected for moisture. The isoelectric point, determined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, is 5.2. No carbohydrate or phospholipid was detected in the enzyme. The purification procedure provides an over-all yield of about 25% from cell cake to crystals, and is adaptable to large scale isolation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1987844340,"Partial blockade of beta-adrenergic end-organ response to the autonomic nervous system was effected in a group of older men by administration of propranolol. The result was improved performance in a learning task. The data support the hypothesis that the learning decrement found among older men is not simply a manifestation of structural change in the central nervous system but is, at least in part, associated with the heightened arousal of the autonomic nervous system that accompanies the learning task."

The technique permits continuous observation of the enzymatic reaction of an individual spermatozoon.

Tuberculin protein-containing fractions were active in each test. These results show that in vitro lymphocyte transformation is not necessarily a corollary of delayed type hypersensitivity."

https://openalex.org/W1543804973,"Abstract The sequence at the COOH terminus of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A is known to be -Pro-Val-His-Phe-Asp-Ala-Ser-Val. When the last 4 residues are removed by peptic hydrolysis, the resulting des-(121-124)-RNase, which was earlier thought to be inactive, is now shown to possess about 0.5% of the activity of the native enzyme toward cyclic 2',3'-cytidylic acid. Several types of experiments show that this activity is intrinsic. The highly purified derivative binds the inhibitor 2'-cytidylic acid at pH 5.5 with a dissociation constant of 40 µm compared with 3 µm for native RNase. When the activity of the derivative is measured toward cyclic cytidylic acid, Km is 0.5 mm and the turnover number is 2 x 10-3 sec-1; these values represent a Km that is twice that of RNase but an activity that is 0.005 that of the initial enzyme. These findings are consistent with results on the alkylation of residues that are considered part of the active site of RNase; in the des-(121-124)-derivative the alkylation of histidine-12 and lysine-41 is still strongly facilitated but the susceptibility of histidine-119 is diminished. An increase in the pK of histidine-119 which could account for the alkylation results could also contribute to the diminution of the catalytic activity. The relatively strong binding of inhibitor by des-(121-124)-RNase suggests that serine-123 can have only a minor role in binding substrate. However, when phenylalanine-120 is removed from the des-(121-124)-derivative by controlled hydrolysis with carboxypeptidase A at pH 5 and 45°, the activity, the ability to bind inhibitor, and the susceptibilities of the histidine residues to alkylation are lost. The transition temperature of the des-(120-124)-derivative is lowered to 34° from 61° for RNase A. The phenylalanine residue, which in the three-dimensional structure fits into a hydrophobic pocket in the molecule, thus has an important role in maintenance of the native conformation of the enzyme. Histidine-119 as well as phenylalanine-120 can be removed by hydrolysis of the des-(121-124)-derivative by carboxypeptidase A at pH 7.6. The molecule with the 6 residues removed has a transition temperature of 32° and a structure highly susceptible to proteolysis by trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1510675101,"Abstract The levels of dethiobiotin synthetase in Escherichia coli have been increased 6-fold over the wild type when prepared from a λ-lysogen carrying the bioD gene under phage control. The purification procedure employed gave a nearly homogeneous preparation, over 90% pure, with a 190-fold increase in specific activity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 42,000 and exists as a dimer. The stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that 1 mole each of ATP and CO2 are required and that ADP is the end product of the reaction. The Km values for each of the substrates were determined and ADP was found to be a competitive inhibitor. Only CTP can partially replace ATP while diaminobiotin is only 37% as effective as 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid. CO2 is the substrate in this reaction rather than bicarbonate (HCO3-). Carbamyl phosphate which gives some stimulation in cell-free extracts is inactive with the purified enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1983857291,"Immunization of mice with pig erythrocytes caused impairment of the antibody response to subsequent immunization with sheep erythrocytes, a phenomenon called ""antigen competition."" Paradoxically, spleen cells from mice previously injected with pig erythrocytes produced an increased response when immunized in vitro with sheep erythrocytes. Augmentation of the in vitro response is due to an increase in one of the interacting cell types. ""Antigen competition"" is not due to competition for cells. Cell transfer experiments provided evidence that ""antigen competition"" observed in animals is the result of a humoral factor, presumably antibody, present in the animal but eliminated during preparation of cells for culture."
https://openalex.org/W1004956063,"A simple method is described for purifying protein synthesis initiation factor F2 which involves ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation of a 0.5 m NH4Cl wash of the ribosomes, followed by chromatography on cellulose phosphate and then on Sephadex G-200. Cellulose phosphate chromatography is an especially effective method, producing a 36-fold purification. The over-all yield of F2 is 23%, the over-all purification is 115-fold, and the final product shows one band on analytical disc gel electrophoresis. With this preparation it was shown that 1 molecule of F2 could stimulate the binding of up to 7 N-formylmethionyl tRNA molecules to ribosomes. This indicates that F2 is released from the ribosome after catalyzing the binding reaction and can then be reused."

https://openalex.org/W1650206051,"Abstract Crystalline l-asparaginase from Escherichia coli B has been shown to consist of four subunits (mol wt 33,000) by the methods of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium, viscosity, and electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on polyacrylamide gels. The dissociation-reconstitution behavior of the enzyme has been characterized. The native enzyme does not dissociate into subunits in neutral aqueous solutions at protein concentrations as low as 15 µg per ml. No evidence for an intermediate form between the native protein (mol wt 133,000) and its 33,000 molecular weight subunits is found. The enzyme can be dissociated into its subunits in 7 m urea and 5 m guanidine and then its disulfides can be reduced. No enzymatic activity remains. Upon reoxidation and reconstitution the enzyme regains at least 85% of its original activity. The physical properties of the native and reconstituted enzyme are virtually identical. The enzyme appears to be essentially globular in shape in aqueous solution. Approximately 30% of the tyrosine residues titrate readily. Titration of the remaining tyrosine residues results in the dissociation and denaturation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1594574475,"Abstract Homoserine dehydrogenase of Rhodospirillum rubrum has been purified by heat treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and by two successive gel filtration steps on Sephadex G-200 in the absence and presence of l-threonine, an allosteric inhibitor. The pure protein is free of aspartokinase and aspartate β-semialdehyde dehydrogenase activities. From the sedimentation velocity centrifugation and Sephadex gel filtration experiments, a molecular weight of approximately 138,000 can be calculated. Since the homoserine dehydrogenase of R. rubrum shows reversible association-dissociation behavior as well as drastic conformational alterations in the presence of various ligands, this value of 138,000 may reflect the average molecular weight of more than one form of the enzyme because of a rapid equilibrium between these species in solution. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and β-mercaptoethanol, the native enzyme is dissociated to smaller units of approximate molecular weight of 48,000 ± 5,000. Titration of the native protein with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) reveals 1 mole of —SH group per mole of enzyme; however, under denaturating conditions, between 3 and 4 moles of —SH per 140,000 g are titratable. The enzyme shows aggregation behavior in the presence of l-threonine, and the state of aggregation is dependent on the presence and absence of reducing agents and on the protein concentration. In phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.001 m l-threonine and 0.002 m dithiothreitol, the enzyme sediments at a calculated s20,w value of 9.3 S; upon removal of threonine this high molecular weight species dissociates to its original size with an s20,w value of 6.9 S. In the absence of any thiol reagent, however, a large number of catalytically active nonspecific aggregates, ranging in molecular weights from 300,000 to 2 x 106, are detected by various analytical methods such as gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A possible explanation for the formation of these aggregates is that the enzyme molecules are covalently linked through interchain disulfide bonds."
