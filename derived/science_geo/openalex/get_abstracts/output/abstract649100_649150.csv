https://openalex.org/W3010923525,"Short-chain fatty acids are processed from indigestible dietary fibers by gut bacteria and have immunomodulatory properties. Here, we investigate propionic acid (PA) in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease. Serum and feces of subjects with MS exhibited significantly reduced PA amounts compared with controls, particularly after the first relapse. In a proof-of-concept study, we supplemented PA to therapy-naive MS patients and as an add-on to MS immunotherapy. After 2 weeks of PA intake, we observed a significant and sustained increase of functionally competent regulatory T (Treg) cells, whereas Th1 and Th17 cells decreased significantly. Post-hoc analyses revealed a reduced annual relapse rate, disability stabilization, and reduced brain atrophy after 3 years of PA intake. Functional microbiome analysis revealed increased expression of Treg-cell-inducing genes in the intestine after PA intake. Furthermore, PA normalized Treg cell mitochondrial function and morphology in MS. Our findings suggest that PA can serve as a potent immunomodulatory supplement to MS drugs."

We quantified the phosphorylation state at multiple sites of the tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid markers across four decades of disease progression in dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. We identified a pattern of tau staging where site-specific phosphorylation changes occur at different periods of disease progression and follow distinct trajectories over time. These tau phosphorylation state changes are uniquely associated with structural, metabolic, neurodegenerative and clinical markers of disease, and some (p-tau217 and p-tau181) begin with the initial increases in aggregate amyloid-β as early as two decades before the development of aggregated tau pathology. Others (p-tau205 and t-tau) increase with atrophy and hypometabolism closer to symptom onset. These findings provide insights into the pathways linking tau, amyloid-β and neurodegeneration, and may facilitate clinical trials of tau-based treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3012163988,"Standard clinical care in neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units (NICUs and PICUs, respectively) involves continuous monitoring of vital signs with hard-wired devices that adhere to the skin and, in certain instances, can involve catheter-based pressure sensors inserted into the arteries. These systems entail risks of causing iatrogenic skin injuries, complicating clinical care and impeding skin-to-skin contact between parent and child. Here we present a wireless, non-invasive technology that not only offers measurement equivalency to existing clinical standards for heart rate, respiration rate, temperature and blood oxygenation, but also provides a range of important additional features, as supported by data from pilot clinical studies in both the NICU and PICU. These new modalities include tracking movements and body orientation, quantifying the physiological benefits of skin-to-skin care, capturing acoustic signatures of cardiac activity, recording vocal biomarkers associated with tonality and temporal characteristics of crying and monitoring a reliable surrogate for systolic blood pressure. These platforms have the potential to substantially enhance the quality of neonatal and pediatric critical care. Soft electronic patches worn on the skin of infants or children in intensive-care units have a wide range of capabilities in aiding critical care, including monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, cardiac activity, movement and crying."

https://openalex.org/W3011577943,"Despite being only one-atom thick, defect-free graphene is considered to be completely impermeable to all gases and liquids. This conclusion is based on theory and supported by experiments that could not detect gas permeation through micrometre-size membranes within a detection limit of 10^5 to 10^6 atoms per second. Here, using small monocrystalline containers tightly sealed with graphene, we show that defect-free graphene is impermeable with an accuracy of eight to nine orders of magnitude higher than in the previous experiments. We could discern permeation of just a few helium atoms per hour, and this detection limit is also valid for all other tested gases (neon, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, krypton and xenon), except for hydrogen. Hydrogen shows noticeable permeation, even though its molecule is larger than helium and should experience a higher energy barrier. The puzzling observation is attributed to a two-stage process that involves dissociation of molecular hydrogen at catalytically active graphene ripples, followed by adsorbed atoms flipping to the other side of the graphene sheet with a relatively low activation energy of about 1.0 electronvolt, a value close to that previously reported for proton transport. Our work provides a key reference for the impermeability of two-dimensional materials and is important from a fundamental perspective and for their potential applications."
https://openalex.org/W3010852509,"Selective autophagy of organelles is critical for cellular differentiation, homeostasis, and organismal health. Autophagy of the ER (ER-phagy) is implicated in human neuropathy but is poorly understood beyond a few autophagosomal receptors and remodelers. By using an ER-phagy reporter and genome-wide CRISPRi screening, we identified 200 high-confidence human ER-phagy factors. Two pathways were unexpectedly required for ER-phagy. First, reduced mitochondrial metabolism represses ER-phagy, which is opposite of general autophagy and is independent of AMPK. Second, ER-localized UFMylation is required for ER-phagy to repress the unfolded protein response via IRE1α. The UFL1 ligase is brought to the ER surface by DDRGK1 to UFMylate RPN1 and RPL26 and preferentially targets ER sheets for degradation, analogous to PINK1-Parkin regulation during mitophagy. Our data provide insight into the cellular logic of ER-phagy, reveal parallels between organelle autophagies, and provide an entry point to the relatively unexplored process of degrading the ER network."
https://openalex.org/W3011651865,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is the major single cause of stillbirth1 and is also associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality2,3, impaired health and educational achievement in childhood4,5 and with a range of diseases in later life6. Effective screening and intervention for FGR is an unmet clinical need. Here, we performed ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC–MS/MS) metabolomics on maternal serum at 12, 20 and 28 weeks of gestational age (wkGA) using 175 cases of term FGR and 299 controls from the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study, conducted in Cambridge, UK, to identify predictive metabolites. Internal validation using 36 wkGA samples demonstrated that a ratio of the products of the relative concentrations of two positively associated metabolites (1-(1-enyl-stearoyl)-2-oleoyl-GPC (P-18:0/18:1) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol) to the product of the relative concentrations of two negatively associated metabolites (5α-androstan-3α,17α-diol disulfate and N1,N12-diacetylspermine) predicted FGR at term. The ratio had approximately double the discrimination as compared to a previously developed angiogenic biomarker7, the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1:placental growth factor (sFLT1:PlGF) ratio (AUC 0.78 versus 0.64, P = 0.0001). We validated the predictive performance of the metabolite ratio in two sub-samples of a demographically dissimilar cohort, Born in Bradford (BiB), conducted in Bradford, UK (P = 0.0002). Screening and intervention using this metabolite ratio in conjunction with ultrasonic imaging at around 36 wkGA could plausibly prevent adverse events through enhanced fetal monitoring and targeted induction of labor. The relative concentrations of four metabolites in maternal blood at 36 weeks of gestation predict fetal growth restriction in infants subsequently born at term, enabling enhanced fetal monitoring in pregnancies at risk."
https://openalex.org/W3010979822,"Summary Neuronal oscillations in the frontal cortex have been hypothesized to play a role in the organization of high-level cognition. Within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), there is a prominent oscillation in the theta frequency (4–8 Hz) during reward-guided behavior, but it is unclear whether this oscillation has causal significance. One methodological challenge is that it is difficult to manipulate theta without affecting other neural signals, such as single-neuron firing rates. A potential solution is to use closed-loop control to record theta in real time and use this signal to control the application of electrical microstimulation to the OFC. Using this method, we show that theta oscillations in the OFC are critically important for reward-guided learning and that they are driven by theta oscillations in the hippocampus (HPC). The ability to disrupt OFC computations via spatially localized and temporally precise stimulation could lead to novel treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders involving OFC dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3011921127,"The accretion of volatile-rich material from the outer Solar System represents a crucial prerequisite for Earth to develop oceans and become a habitable planet1–4. However, the timing of this accretion remains controversial5–8. It has been proposed that volatile elements were added to Earth by the late accretion of a late veneer consisting of carbonaceous-chondrite-like material after core formation had ceased6,9,10. This view could not be reconciled with the ruthenium (Ru) isotope composition of carbonaceous chondrites5,11, which is distinct from that of the modern mantle12, or of any known meteorite group5. As a possible solution, Earth’s pre-late-veneer mantle could already have contained a fraction of Ru that was not fully extracted by core formation13. The presence of such pre-late-veneer Ru can only be established if its isotope composition is distinct from that of the modern mantle. Here we report the first high-precision, mass-independent Ru isotope compositions for Eoarchaean ultramafic rocks from southwest Greenland, which display a relative 100Ru excess of 22 parts per million compared with the modern mantle value. This 100Ru excess indicates that the source of the Eoarchaean rocks already contained a substantial fraction of Ru before the accretion of the late veneer. By 3.7 billion years ago, the mantle beneath southwest Greenland had not yet fully equilibrated with late accreted material. Otherwise, no Ru isotopic difference relative to the modern mantle would be observed. If constraints from other highly siderophile elements besides Ru are also considered14, the composition of the modern mantle can only be reconciled if the late veneer contained substantial amounts of carbonaceous-chondrite-like materials with their characteristic 100Ru deficits. These data therefore relax previous constraints on the late veneer and are consistent with volatile-rich material from the outer Solar System being delivered to Earth during late accretion. Ruthenium isotope compositions of the oldest preserved mantle rocks from Greenland imply that volatile-rich outer Solar System material was not delivered to Earth until very late in the planet’s formation."

https://openalex.org/W3011996111,"When a magnetic impurity exists in a metal, conduction electrons form a spin cloud that screens the impurity spin. This basic phenomenon is called the Kondo effect. Contrary to electric charge screening, the spin screening cloud occurs quantum coherently, forming spin-singlet entanglement with the impurity. Although the spins interact locally around the impurity, the cloud can spread out over micrometers. The Kondo cloud has never been detected to date, and its existence, a fundamental aspect of the Kondo effect, remains as a long-standing controversial issue. Here we present experimental evidence of a Kondo cloud extending over a length of micrometers comparable to the theoretical length $\xi_\mathrm{K}$. In our device, a Kondo impurity is formed in a quantum dot (QD), one-sided coupling to a quasi-one dimensional channel~\cite{Theory_Proposal_HS} that houses a Fabry-Perot (FP) interferometer of various gate-defined lengths $L > 1 \, \mu$m. When we sweep a voltage on the interferometer end gate separated from the QD by the length $L$ to induce FP oscillations in conductance, we observe oscillations in measured Kondo temperature $T_\mathrm{K}$, a sign of the cloud at distance $L$. For $L \lesssim \xi_\mathrm{K}$ the $T_\mathrm{K}$ oscillation amplitude becomes larger for the smaller $L$, obeying a scaling function of a single parameter $L/ \xi_\mathrm{K}$, while for $L>\xi_\mathrm{K}$ the oscillation is much weaker. The result reveals that $\xi_\mathrm{K}$ is the only length parameter associated with the Kondo effect, and that the cloud lies mostly inside the length $\xi_\mathrm{K}$ which reaches microns. Our experimental method of using electron interferometers offers a way of detecting the spatial distribution of exotic non-Fermi liquids formed by multiple magnetic impurities or multiple screening channels and solving long-standing issues of spin-correlated systems."

Fatty acids and their biosynthesis are essential for the survival of all organisms, representing building blocks of biological membranes, but also energy reserves of a cell and precursors to second messenger molecules (Graber et al., 1994Graber R. Sumida C. Nunez E.A. Fatty acids and cell signal transduction.J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 91-116PubMed Google Scholar). In bacteria, yeasts, and plants, the de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids is essential for survival (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004Schweizer E. Hofmann J.

Subtle changes in fatty acid synthesis impact numerous vital cellular functions and are thus linked to ailments like cancer and obesity (López et al., 2007López M. Lelliott C.J. Vidal-Puig A.

In light of the central metabolic role of fatty acid synthesis, a common biosynthetic route is employed by all organisms (Figure 1A), necessitating four central metabolites—acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, NAD(P)H, and ATP. Despite conservation of the biosynthetic reaction mechanisms, the architecture of fatty acid synthase (FAS) differs across the kingdoms of life. Plants, bacteria, and mitochondria harbor the required activities on individual polypeptides (type II FAS) (White et al., 2005White S.W. Zheng J. Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. The structural biology of type II fatty acid biosynthesis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 791-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Type I FAS systems, where the synthetic activities are combined within a single macromolecular complex, are found in yeasts, Corynebacteria/Mycobacteria/Nocardia (CMN) group bacteria, as well as in higher eukaryotes (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, FAS is formed by a cross-shaped homodimer (Maier et al., 2008Maier T. Leibundgut M. Ban N.

Structural studies by multiple labs have established that the type I fungal FAS is a D3 symmetric 2.6 MDa multi-enzyme complex that forms a barrel-shaped particle with a length of 270 Å and a width of 250 Å (Gipson et al., 2010Gipson P.

USA. 1978; 75: 5792-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the S. cerevisiae FAS is composed of six α subunit copies, which form an equatorial central wheel, and six β subunit copies, which form the two domes of the particle (Figure 1B). All enzymatic activities required for the synthesis of saturated C16-C18 fatty acid chains reside within α- and β-subunits (Figure 1C) (Lynen, 1980Lynen F.

The α-subunit contains ketoreductase (KR), ketosynthase (KS), and phosphopantetheine transferase (PPT) domains, while the β subunit harbors acetyltransferase (AT), enoylreductase (ER), and dehydratase (DH) domains. The malonyl/palmitoyl transferase (MPT) domain is mostly formed by the C-terminal part of the β subunit and completed by the N terminus of the α subunit (Jenni et al., 2007Jenni S. Leibundgut M.

The acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain is tethered flexibly onto the α subunit (Gipson et al., 2010Gipson P. Mills D.J. Wouts R. Grininger M. Vonck J. Kühlbrandt W.

In addition to academic interest in fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acids have emerged as platform compounds for the biotechnological production of fine chemicals and biofuels (Biermann et al., 2011Biermann U. Bornscheuer U. Meier M.A.R. Metzger J.O. Schäfer H.J. Oils and fats as renewable raw materials in chemistry.Angew. Chem. Int.

In this context, fungal FAS has been engineered to generate e.g., short chain fatty acids and related polyketides (Gajewski et al., 2017bGajewski J. Buelens F. Serdjukow S. Janßen M. Cortina N.

Engineering fungal de novo fatty acid synthesis for short chain fatty acid production.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14650Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite academic and biotechnological interest in FAS, several mechanistic and regulatory aspects have remained elusive. The metabolic load exerted upon a cell for the biosynthesis of a single palmitic acid amounts to the energetic equivalent of 122 ATP molecules (Nelson and Cox, 2012Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry.Sixth Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, 2012Google Scholar). The energy consumption and central metabolic importance of FAS requires a tight control of its activity, which is ascribed to transcriptional control (Schweizer and Hofmann, 2004Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbial type I fatty acid synthases (FAS): major players in a network of cellular FAS systems.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), through multiple layers of ACC regulation (Wakil et al., 1983Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. Joshi V.C. Fatty acid synthesis and its regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 537-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and feedback inhibition by palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA (Lust and Lynen, 1968Lust G. Lynen F. The inhibition of the fatty acid synthetase multienzyme complex of yeast by long-chain acyl coenzyme A compounds.Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 7: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No protein that directly regulates FAS activity has been described to date. Equally, it is not known if stochastic ACP movement is coincident with conformational changes of fungal FAS domes, or if accessory factors are required, because FAS structures with ACPs in defined functional intermediate states remain elusive. Additionally, a functional unit within FAS is defined by spatial proximity of catalytic domains residing on α- and β-subunits in accordance with fungal FAS architecture (Anselmi et al., 2010Anselmi C. Grininger M. Gipson P. Faraldo-Gómez J.D. Mechanism of substrate shuttling by the acyl-carrier protein within the fatty acid mega-synthase.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 12357-12364Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, Leibundgut et al., 2007Leibundgut M. Jenni S. Frick C. Ban N. Structural basis for substrate delivery by acyl carrier protein in the yeast fatty acid synthase.Science. 2007; 316: 288-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but other possibilities cannot be excluded. Here, we describe the discovery of a regulatory subunit of yeast FAS, which we propose to term the FAS γ subunit. A maximum of six γ subunit copies bind to a single α6β6 FAS molecule occupying all six reaction chambers, with each γ subunit simultaneously contacting a single α subunit and two adjacent β subunits. γ subunit binding stabilizes a rotated FAS conformation, which is accompanied by ACP domains rearranging from KS domain positions to AT domain positions. The γ subunit regulates FAS enzymatic activity in response to the abundance of its co-substrate NADPH, induces hysteretic behavior of FAS turnover, and suppresses futile ER catalytic cycles. The γ subunit thus directly interacts with FAS, regulates its activity, and influences its structure, including the ACP shuttle system. To mechanistically interrogate structural determinants governing iterative shuttling, we set out to establish a purification procedure that would yield highly active, biochemically, and structurally homogeneous FAS from the yeast S. cerevisiae. We adapted a chromatography-free purification procedure to the FAS that had previously yielded preparations of higher specific activity for 20S and 26S proteasomes (Haselbach et al., 2017Haselbach D. Schrader J. Lambrecht F. Henneberg F. Chari A. Stark H. Long-range allosteric regulation of the human 26S proteasome by 20S proteasome-targeting cancer drugs.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, Schrader et al., 2016Schrader J. Henneberg F. Mata R.A. Tittmann K. Schneider T.R. Stark H. Bourenkov G. Chari A. The inhibition mechanism of human 20S proteasomes enables next-generation inhibitor design.Science. 2016; 353: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This approach relies on fractionated PEG precipitation and density gradient centrifugation as orthogonal purification steps (Figure 1D) and allows for gentle, yet stringent, purification at constant (low-) ionic strength (Figures 1D–1F). During the entire purification process, FAS concentrations never drop below 0.4 μM and we discovered a 20 kDa protein that reproducibly co-purifies with FAS (Figure 1E). Tandem-MS of tryptic digests identified this protein as Tma17p (Table S1). We cross-validated that Tma17p represents the co-purified 20 kDa protein by generating a Δtma17 knockout yeast strain and purifying FAS. As shown in Figure 1F, when purified from the Δtma17 strain, the 20 kDa band is absent from purified FAS fractions, corroborating the tandem-MS results. Thus, Tma17p co-purifies with the FAS and appears to represent a putative hitherto unknown subunit of yeast FAS. An additional protein subunit of yeast FAS has not been described in close to five decades of biochemical investigation. Tma17p has previously been described to be associated with the translational machinery or involved in proteasome assembly (Fleischer et al., 2006Fleischer T.C. Weaver C.M. McAfee K.J. Jennings J.L.

However, SDS-PAGE and tandem-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses indicate that neither the ribosome nor the proteasome are present in stoichiometric amounts in our FAS preparations, whereas Tma17p definitively is (Figure 1E). Tma17p is widely conserved in yeasts (Figure S1A; Data S1) and has been described to be upregulated under conditions of cellular stress and function in the context of proteasome assembly (Hanssum et al., 2014Hanssum A.

However, we were unable to reproduce formerly described viability defects of Δtma17 yeast strains in response to stressors in several genetic backgrounds (Figure S1B). On the other hand, co-purification and co-sedimentation of Tma17p with FAS in the 40S region of gradients suggests a direct biochemical interaction, and Tma17p abundance in purified FAS fractions indicates that earlier copy number estimates are incorrect (https://www.yeastgenome.org) (Cherry et al., 2012Cherry J.M.

An evolutionarily conserved pathway controls proteasome homeostasis.Nature. 2016; 536: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we chose to perform a series of control experiments to establish that Tma17p indeed is a bona fide subunit of yeast FAS. First, we investigated the stability of the Tma17p-FAS interaction in dependence of ionic strength. Purified FAS was loaded onto density gradients containing either 50 mM KCl, 150 mM KCl, or 250 mM KCl (Figure 2A). Co-purified, endogenous Tma17p quantitatively dissociates from FAS at 250 mM KCl, which results in the sedimentation of Tma17p in top fractions of density gradients, akin to recombinant Tma17p (rTma17p) (Figure S1C). At 150 mM KCl, roughly half of co-purified Tma17p dissociates, whereas at 50 mM KCl, the co-purified Tma17p remains firmly associated to FAS and co-sediments in the 40S region. Second, we asked if ΔTma17p-FAS could be reconstituted with rTma17p and if the stability of the reconstituted complex resembled that of the endogenous complex. While the reconstituted complex is stable at 50 mM KCl, rTma17p dissociates quantitatively at 150 mM KCl (Figure 2B). We attribute this difference to the lack of post-translational modification upon expression in E. coli (Table S1). Third, we set out to quantify the thermodynamics of Tma17p-binding to FAS. ΔTma17p-FAS was incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant, fluorescently labeled Tma17p, and complex formation was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, followed by quantification of the FAS-bound Tma17p fluorescence. Binding of Tma17p to FAS results in the shift of its mobility to a position, where it co-migrates with FAS. When the experiment is performed at 1 μM FAS, full saturation occurs at a 6-fold molar excess of fluorescent Tma17p, indicating that 6 copies of Tma17p can simultaneously bind to one FAS molecule. When the binding data were fit with a sigmoidal binding model using the Hill equation, this experiment revealed a positive cooperativity of Tma17p binding to FAS (Hill coefficient of nH = 1.6 ± 0.1) and a dissociation constant of K0.5 = 3.1 ± 0.1 μM (Figure 2C). When the data were alternatively fit with a quadratic equation, a KD = 0.35 ± 0.07 μM was obtained (Figure S1D). Fourth, fluorescently labeled trypsin inhibitor, which is both similar in size and charge, was unable to bind FAS under the same conditions (Figure S1E), negating unspecific binding of Tma17p to FAS. We asked if the entire Tma17p polypeptide segment is essential for its association with FAS. Guided by secondary structure predictions (Figure S1F), we either singly removed the N-terminal segment (1–24) or the C-terminal segment (117–150). Both deletions were individually sufficient to abolish binding of Tma17p to FAS (Figure 2D). Taken together, these experiments indicate that Tma17p is a weakly associated, salt-labile, integral subunit of the yeast FAS. It appears to have escaped identification as a FAS subunit due to the relatively high salt conditions previously employed to purify FAS and spontaneous dissociation of Tma17p based on its weak affinity (Leibundgut et al., 2007Leibundgut M.

The crystal structure of yeast fatty acid synthase, a cellular machine with eight active sites working together.Cell. 2007; 129: 319-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The observed cooperativity of binding and the synergistic requirement of both N as well as C termini exclude non-specific association of Tma17p with FAS. Henceforth, we will refer to Tma17p as the FAS γ subunit, to FAS devoid of the γ subunit as Δγ-FAS. To gather insights into the function of the γ subunit, we analyzed FAS steady-state kinetics both in its presence and absence and measured the rates of FAS substrate turnover with respect to varying concentrations of the substrates acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH. This analysis revealed substrate-excess inhibition for both acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, and a moderate modulation of the maximum rate (Vmax), substrate affinity (K0.5app), cooperativity of substrate binding (Hill coefficient nH), and substrate inhibition (Ki) by the γ subunit (Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast, the analysis of steady-state kinetics at different NADPH concentrations revealed a direct impact of the γ subunit on NADPH binding and processing by FAS (Figures 3C–3F). With Δγ-FAS, steady-state conditions are established at once such that the measured initial and steady-state rates are equal. In contrast, FAS substrate turnover progress curves exhibit a pronounced hysteretic behavior in the presence of the γ subunit. FAS displays a smaller activity (v0 > 0) and undergoes a mono-exponential activation phase to establish steady state with a multi-fold enhanced activity (vss > v0) before substrate depletion sets in (Figures 3C, 3D, and S2). The apparent Michaelis constant (K0.5app) for NADPH is lower in the case of Δγ-FAS and increased 3-fold in the presence of the γ subunit both for initial and steady-state rates (Figure 3E). This effect elicited by the γ subunit is more pronounced at low NADPH concentrations and almost absent at higher concentrations, where the initial rate nearly equals the steady-state rate (Figures 3C, 3D, and S2). Steady-state conditions are established after ∼20 s, implying that a slow, large-scale conformational change coincides with activation. Even the addition of high molar excesses of trypsin inhibitor as a control (Figure 3F) exerted no such effect, highlighting γ subunit specificity. At high NADPH concentrations (≥100 μM), the γ subunit enhances the activity of FAS in comparison to Δγ-FAS by ∼25%, whereas at lower NADPH concentrations, it slows the turnover rate of FAS almost 2-fold.Figure S2Hysteresis in FAS Turnover in the Presence of the γ Subunit, Related to Figure 3Show full captionTop panel: Shown are original data in triplicate of FAS turnover in the presence of the γ subunit at 20 μM NADPH (left) as well as the respective first derivatives (right) to determine pre-steady-state, steady-state and activation phases.Middle panel: Quality of data fitting as indicated by the overlay of raw data (black line, left) with the fit (red line, left) obtained by the equation depicted in the right.Bottom panel: Shown are original data in triplicate of FAS turnover in the absence of the γ subunit at 20 μM NADPH (left) as well as the respective first derivatives (right).

Bottom panel: Shown are original data in triplicate of FAS turnover in the absence of the γ subunit at 20 μM NADPH (left) as well as the respective first derivatives (right). Note that in this case no hysteresis is observed as indicated by the first derivative. We also observed NADPH to be consumed by FAS in the ER domain even in the absence of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA (Figure 3G), where a possible deleterious side reaction can occur: the NADPH-dependent oxidation of oxygen by the FMN cofactor to form reactive oxygen species including H2O2 (Chaiyen et al., 2012Chaiyen P. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. The enigmatic reaction of flavins with oxygen.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We recognized that the γ subunit retards NADPH turnover in the absence of the substrates acetyl- and malonyl-CoA (Figure 3G). Therefore, the γ subunit additionally enhances the productivity of FAS by suppressing ER domain futile cycles. Together, the kinetic data show that the γ subunit impacts FAS enzymatic activity, in particular the reductase activities, such that the NADPH-dependence dynamic range is broadened to accommodate differences in cellular metabolism. The estimated K0.5app of Δγ-FAS for NADPH (17.7 μM) is significantly lower than reported cellular concentrations of NADPH (50–150 μM) (Gancedo and Gancedo, 1973Gancedo J.M. Gancedo C.

To merge these into one high-throughput, highly multiplexed, single-cell assay, we quantify cell morphological features by their underlying, antibody-measurable molecular components, which empowers mass cytometers to 'see' like pathologists. When applied to 71 diverse clinical samples, single-cell morphometric profiling reveals robust and distinct patterns of 'morphometric' markers for each major cell type. Individually, lamin B1 highlights acute leukemias, lamin A/C helps distinguish normal from neoplastic mature T cells, and VAMP-7 recapitulates light-cytometric side scatter. Combined with machine learning, morphometric markers form intuitive visualizations of normal and neoplastic cellular distribution and differentiation. When recalibrated for myelomonocytic blast enumeration, this approach is superior to flow cytometry and comparable to expert microscopy, bypassing years of specialized training. The contextualization of traditional surface markers on independent morphometric frameworks permits more sensitive and automated diagnosis of complex hematopoietic diseases."

However, there is a knowledge gap in the mechanisms underlying the direct regulation of angiogenesis by nerves. In the current study, we examined the regulation of angiogenesis by sensory nerves in response to inflammation using the cornea, a normally avascular and densely innervated ocular tissue, as a model. We used desiccating stress as an inflammatory stimulus in vivo and found that sub-basal and epithelial nerve densities in the cornea were reduced in dry eye disease (DED). We established a co-culture system of trigeminal ganglion sensory neurons and vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and found that neurons isolated from mice with DED directly promoted VEC proliferation and tube formation compared with normal controls. In addition, these neurons expressed and secreted higher levels of substance P (SP), a proinflammatory neuropeptide. SP potently promoted VEC activation in vitro and blockade of SP signaling with spantide I, an antagonist of SP receptor Neurokinin-1, significantly reduced corneal neovascularization in vivo. Spantide I and siRNA knockdown of SP abolished the promotion of VEC activation by DED neurons in vitro. Taken together, our data suggested that sensory neurons directly promote angiogenesis via SP signaling in response to inflammation in the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W3011545881,"Background Depression is a common mental disorder among prisoners characterized by a mood change involving a feeling of sadness, lack of interest, or hopelessness that lasts for weeks, months, or even longer. Besides imprisonment, depression is the primary factor leading to suicidal attempts. However, little is known about the depressive status of prisoners in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the magnitude and associated factors of depressive symptoms among prisoners of Debre Berhan prison. Methods We conducted an institution-based cross-sectional study. We collected data from 336 randomly selected prisoners using interviewer-administered Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We collected the data from May 3 to 28, 2015, and performed binary logistic regression to identify independent predictors of depressive disorder. Result Out of the total of 336 prisoners, 98% (n = 330) were males. Using PHQ-9 at the cut-off point of ≥5, we found the prevalence of depression to be 44% (n = 148). Being widowed (AOR = 6.30; CI: 1.09–36.67), having a college or university level educational status (AOR = 5.34; CI:1.59–17.94), having a history of suicide attempt (AOR = 2.76 CI: 1.04–7.31), having faced severe stressful life events (AOR = 2.57; CI: 1.41–4.67), being sentenced for 5 to 10 years (AOR = 2.51; CI:1.32–4.79), and having a history of chronic medical illness (AOR = 3.32 CI: 1.26–8.75) were found to be independently associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of depression among prisoners of Debre Berhan prison. Hence, designing strategies for early screening and treatment of depression at prisons is crucial."

Methods Food consumption and prices were obtained from the Household Budget Survey (n = 55,970 households) and National Dietary Survey (n = 32,749 individuals). The sample was stratified into capitals of the states and further by income levels according to the official minimum wage (totaling 108 geographic-economic strata, or GES). Linear programming models were performed for each GES in order to find the lowest cost of diets that meet a set of nutritional constraints. In order to find realistic diets, constraints referring to preferences were introduced in the models allowing optimized food quantities to depart progressively from the current intake for each food and food group. The impact of meeting each target nutrient was assessed by performing models removing each nutrient at the time. Results The observed and optimized diet costs were US$2.16 and US$2.58 per capita/day. The highest cost increment and the greatest food shifts were observed in the lowest income level. The nutrient adequacy was reached by mainly increasing fruits and vegetables, beans, fish and seafood, dairy, nuts, and eggs; and reducing red and processed meat, chicken, margarine and butter, cookies, cakes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and sauces. As the departure from the current intakes increase, the optimized healthy diet cost reduced. In the lowest income, the lowest cost increment was about US$ 0.10; in the higher income levels, it tended to be cheaper than the observed cost. Calcium was the most expensive nutrient to meet adequacy. Conclusion Nutritionally adequate diets are possible but costlier than the observed."

Non-progressing cognitive dysfunction occurs in 20 to 50% of DMD patients. Furthermore, loss of expression of the Dp427 dystrophin isoform in the brain of mdx mice, the most used animal model of DMD, leads to behavioral deficits thought to be linked to insufficiencies in synaptogenesis and channel clustering at synapses. Mdx mice where the locomotor phenotype is mild also display a high and maladaptive response to stress. Recently, we generated Dmdmdx rats carrying an out-of frame mutation in exon 23 of the DMD gene and exhibiting a skeletal and cardiac muscle phenotype similar to DMD patients. In order to evaluate the impact of dystrophin loss on behavior, we explored locomotion parameters as well as anhedonia, anxiety and response to stress, in Dmdmdx rats aged from 1.5 to 7 months, in comparison to wild-type (WT) littermates. Pattern of dystrophin expression in the brain of WT and Dmdmdx rats was characterized by western-blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. We showed that dystrophin-deficient Dmdmdx rats displayed motor deficits in the beam test, without association with depressive or anxiety-like phenotype. However, Dmdmdx rats exhibited a strong response to restraint-induced stress, with a large increase in freezings frequency and duration, suggesting an alteration in a functional circuit including the amygdala. In brain, large dystrophin isoform Dp427 was not expressed in mutant animals. Dmdmdx rat is therefore a good animal model for preclinical evaluations of new treatments for DMD but care must be taken with their responses to mild stress."

This evidence suggests that S-palmitoylation may be well-fitted to convey isoform-specific modulation of Navs. In our study, we show that Nav1.6 is chemically modified and functionally regulated by S-palmitoylation. We identify two S-palmitoylation sites (Cys1169 and Cys1170) in the second intracellular loop (loop 2) that are responsible for modulating the voltage dependence of inactivation and an Nav1.6-exclusive site (Cys1978) at the C terminus, the S-palmitoylation of which enhances Nav1.6 current. It is important to note that the current amplitude of Nav1.2, which lacks the C-terminal cysteine, is not subject to S-palmitoylation enhancement, whereas the introduction of an exogenous cysteine at this site recapitulates the response of Nav1.6. Additionally, we find that eliminating S-palmitoylation at Cys1169, Cys1170, and Cys1978 reduces Nav1.6-mediated excitability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Therefore, our data reveal S-palmitoylation as a novel mechanism that regulates Nav1.6 activity and neuronal excitability. Some Nav isoforms are modified by S-palmitoylation. The cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 was shown to be biochemically modified and functionally regulated by S-palmitoylation (9Pei Z. Xiao Y. Meng J. Hudmon A. Cummins T.R. Cardiac sodium channel palmitoylation regulates channel availability and myocyte excitability with implications for arrhythmia generation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27337590): 1203510.1038/ncomms12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Additionally, functional properties and toxin sensitivity of Nav1.2 are altered by manipulating the S-palmitoylation status of the channel with pharmacological treatment (10Bosmans F. Milescu M. Swartz K.J. Palmitoylation influences the function and pharmacology of sodium channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (22123950): 20213-2021810.1073/pnas.1108497108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether Nav1.6 is modified by S-palmitoylation. To test this, we performed acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay on proteins extracted from the mouse cerebellum because of its enriched expression of Nav1.6 as well as the HEK 293 cell line stably expressing Nav1.6. Fig. 2A shows that Nav1.6 is S-palmitoylated in the mouse brain and the Nav1.6 cell line. Next we explored how S-palmitoylation regulates Nav1.6 channel function (Table 1). Because of the difficulty of achieving satisfactory level of Nav1.6 expression in the HEK 293 cell line with heterologous cDNA transfection, we used the ND7/23 cells, a hybrid cell line of mouse neuroblastoma fused with rat dorsal root ganglia neurons (21Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P.R. Dunn P.M. Harmar A. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Novel cell lines display properties of nociceptive sensory neurons.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1990; 241 (1979443): 187-19410.1098/rspb.1990.0084Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), as our expression system for Nav1.6 transient transfection and voltage clamp recordings. Because ND7/23 cells do not express tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTXr) sodium channels (22Rogers M. Zidar N. Kikelj D. Kirby R.W. Characterization of endogenous sodium channels in the ND7–23 neuroblastoma cell line: implications for use as a heterologous ion channel expression system suitable for automated patch clamp screening.Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2016; 14 (26991361): 109-13010.1089/adt.2016.704Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the Nav1.6 construct was rendered resistant to TTX (Nav1.6r) by a Y371S substitution (23Gasser A. Ho T.S. Cheng X. Chang K.-J. Waxman S.G. Rasband M.N. Dib-Hajj S.D. An ankyrin G–binding motif is necessary and sufficient for targeting Nav1.6 sodium channels to axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.J.

To manipulate the S-palmitoylation status of the Nav1.6r channel, we incubated the transfected cells for overnight with either 25 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2BP) to block S-palmitoylation or 10 μm palmitic acid (PA) to enhance S-palmitoylation. These concentrations of 2BP and PA were determined previously for optimal S-palmitoylation blockage and enhancement (9Pei Z. Xiao Y. Meng J. Hudmon A. Cummins T.R. Cardiac sodium channel palmitoylation regulates channel availability and myocyte excitability with implications for arrhythmia generation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27337590): 1203510.1038/ncomms12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it has been verified that these treatments manipulate protein S-palmitoylation status in our expression system as expected (Fig. 3H).Table 1Biophysical properties of WT and mutant Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 channelMax I densitynInactivationActivationRecoveryVhalfKnVhalfKnτnpA/pFmVmVmsNav1.6-WT

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2B shows the representative traces of Nav1.6r currents from each treatment group. We found that blocking S-palmitoylation with 2BP reduces Nav1.6 current by 67% (2BP: −26.30 ± 3.29 pA/pF versus DMSO:−80.16 ± 8.30 pA/pF; p < 0.0001), whereas increasing S-palmitoylation substrate availability with PA treatment enhances Nav1.6 current by 78% (PA: −142.4 ± 17.27 pA/pF; p = 0.0021 PA versus DMSO) (Fig. 2C). Notably, the current density in the PA group is more than 5-fold of the 2BP group. To eliminate the possibility that these bidirectional effects were mediated by different mechanisms, transfected cells were simultaneously treated with 25 μm 2BP and 10 μm PA. The current density of the co-treated cells (−32.12 ± 7.43 pA/pF) is similar to that of the 2BP group (p = 0.3365 2BP + PA versus 2BP) (Table 1), suggesting that the current density effects produced by the separate 2BP and PA treatments are very likely mediated by S-palmitoylation. These data support the contention that 2BP effectively blocks S-palmitoylation in our expression system, although excessive S-palmitoylation substrate was provided to bias the palmitoylation–depalmitoylation equilibrium. We next examined whether S-palmitoylation affects the voltage dependence of Nav1.6. We observed that blocking S-palmitoylation with 2BP causes an 8-mV hyperpolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation (2BP: V½ = −72.34 ± 0.28 mV versus DMSO: V½ = −64.46 ± 0.21 mV; p < 0.0001), similar to the modulation observed with Nav1.2 (10Bosmans F. Milescu M. Swartz K.J. Palmitoylation influences the function and pharmacology of sodium channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (22123950): 20213-2021810.1073/pnas.1108497108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Nav1.5 (9Pei Z. Xiao Y. Meng J. Hudmon A. Cummins T.R. Cardiac sodium channel palmitoylation regulates channel availability and myocyte excitability with implications for arrhythmia generation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27337590): 1203510.1038/ncomms12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, blocking S-palmitoylation resulted in a slower recovery from inactivation (Fig. 2E, 2BP: τ = 13.18 ± 1.28 ms versus DMSO: τ = 9.84 ± 0.76 ms; p = 0.0246). On the other hand, increasing S-palmitoylation substrate availability with PA treatment does not alter Nav1.6 voltage dependence of activation, steady-state inactivation, or recovery from inactivation. The lack of modulation by PA treatment may be due to saturation of S-palmitoylation at the site(s) regulating voltage dependence of Nav1.6 in our expression system. Thus, providing excessive S-palmitoylation substrate does not achieve appreciable alteration in channel function. In contrast, S-palmitoylation at the site(s) that regulate Nav1.6 current amplitude (Fig. 2, B and C) are likely not saturated, demonstrated by the opposing effects of 2BP and PA treatments. Therefore, our data suggest that S-palmitoylation regulates distinct functional properties of Nav1.6, potentially by modifying different S-palmitoylation sites in the channel. To identify S-palmitoylation sites responsible for the observed functional modulations in Nav1.6, we used CSS-Palm (24Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. CSS-Palm 2.0: an updated software for palmitoylation sites prediction.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21 (18753194): 639-64410.1093/protein/gzn039Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) for potential site prediction. In Nav1.6, two cysteines (Cys1169 and Cys1170) located near the AnkG-binding motif (residues 1094–1102) in loop 2 were predicted to be S-palmitoylated (Fig. 1). These two cysteines are highly conserved among human Nav isoforms (Fig. 3A), yet their functions vary: depalmitoylation of the first cysteine in Nav1.2 (Cys1182) was reported to enhance Nav1.2 inactivation (10Bosmans F. Milescu M. Swartz K.J. Palmitoylation influences the function and pharmacology of sodium channels.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (22123950): 20213-2021810.1073/pnas.1108497108Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the homologous cysteine in Nav1.5 (Cys1178) was not involved in such modulation (9Pei Z. Xiao Y. Meng J. Hudmon A. Cummins T.R. Cardiac sodium channel palmitoylation regulates channel availability and myocyte excitability with implications for arrhythmia generation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27337590): 1203510.1038/ncomms12035Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This indicates potential isoform-specific functionality of S-palmitoylation. We were interested to test whether S-palmitoylation of the homologous cysteines in Nav1.6 regulates channel function and how it might differ from Nav1.2 and Nav1.5. For this purpose, we eliminated S-palmitoylation at Cys1169 and Cys1170 by mutating both to nonpalmitoylatable alanines (Nav1.6–CCAA) and evaluated the functional consequences. Fig. 3B shows the representative traces of TTXr Nav1.6–CCAA current from each treatment group. Compared with Nav1.6–WT, Nav1.6–CCAA displays an 11-mV hyperpolarizing shift in voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation (V½ = −75.5 ± 0.39 mV; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3D). This replicates the voltage dependence modulation observed in Nav1.6–WT with S-palmitoylation blockage, suggesting that S-palmitoylation at these two cysteines is critical for voltage dependence regulation of Nav1.6. However, the Nav1.6–CCAA channel does not completely lose its sensitivity to 2BP treatment and has a minor hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation (V½ = −80.48 ± 0.30 mV; p = 0.0046) (Fig. 3E). Consistent with the WT channel, increasing S-palmitoylation substrate availability with PA treatment does not alter the voltage dependence of activation, steady-state inactivation (Fig. 3E), or recovery from inactivation (Fig. 3F) of Nav1.6–CCAA, whereas blocking S-palmitoylation with 2BP treatment results in slower recovery from inactivation (2BP: τ = 12.69 ± 0.69 ms; DMSO: τ = 10.70 ± 0.38 ms; p = 0.0114). Interestingly, Nav1.6–CCAA exhibits the same bidirectional current density response to 2BP and PA treatments as the WT channel (Fig. 3C), indicating that Cys1169 and Cys1170 do not contribute to regulating Nav1.6 current amplitude. To biochemically confirm S-palmitoylation occurs at Cys1169 and Cys1170, we designed a CD4–Nav1.6–loop 2 fusion protein for use in the ABE assay because of the low expression level of Nav1.6 in the heterologous expression system (Fig. 3G).

Levels of sPLA2-IIA, eicosanoids prostaglandin (PG)E2, PGD synthase were quantified in the sera from patients confirmed to have bacterial sepsis (BS; N = 45), bacterial severe sepsis/septic shock (BSS/SS; N = 35) and healthy subjects (N = 45). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activities were analyzed from cell lysate. Serum levels of sPLA2-IIA, PGE2, and PGDS increased significantly in patients with BS and BSS/SS compared to healthy subjects (p<0.05). COX-2 activity was significantly increased in patients with BS compared to healthy subjects (p<0.05), but not COX-1 activity. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that sPLA2-IIA and PGE2 were independent factors predicting BSS severity. In conclusion, high level of sPLA2-IIA is associated with eicosanoid metabolism in patients with BSS."

The small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein, Cdc42, plays a central role in the formation of filopodia. It has been reported that Cdc42 activity is regulated by cholesterol (Chol). We examined Chol distribution in filopodia using Chol-binding domain 4 (D4) fragment of bacterial toxin, perfringolysin O that senses high membrane concentration of Chol. Our results indicate that fluorescent D4 was enriched at the tip of the outer leaflet of filopodia in the initiation phase of cell adhesion. This enrichment was accompanied by a defect of D4 labeling in the inner leaflet. Steady phase adhered cell experiment indicated that both Cdc42 and ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCA1, were involved in the binding of D4 to the cell surface. Depletion of Chol activated Cdc42. Our results suggest that asymmetric distribution of Chol at the tip of filopodia induces activation of Cdc42, and thus, facilitates filopodia formation."
https://openalex.org/W3012324222,"The dissemination of information on networks involves many important practical issues, such as the spread and containment of rumors in social networks, the spread of infectious diseases among the population, commercial propaganda and promotion, the expansion of political influence and so on. One of the most important problems is the influence-maximization problem which is to find out k most influential nodes under a certain propagate mechanism. Since the problem was proposed in 2001, many works have focused on maximizing the influence in a single network. It is a NP-hard problem and the state-of-art algorithm IMM proposed by Youze Tang et al. achieves a ratio of 63.2% of the optimum with nearly linear time complexity. In recent years, there have been some works of maximizing influence on multilayer networks, either in the situation of single or multiple influences. But most of them study seed selection strategies to maximize their own influence from the perspective of participants. In fact, the problem from the perspective of network owners is also worthy of attention. Since network participants have not had access to all information of the network for reasons such as privacy protection and corporate interests, they may have access to only part of the social network. The owners of networks can get the whole picture of the networks, and they need not only to maximize the overall influence, but also to consider allocating seeds to their customers fairly, i.e., the Fair Seed Allocation (FSA) problem. As far as we know, FSA problem has been studied on a single network, but not on multilayer networks yet. From the perspective of network owners, we propose a multiple-influence diffusion model MMIC on multilayer networks and its FSA problem. Two solutions of FSA problem are given in this paper, and we prove theoretically that our seed allocation schemes are greedy. Subsequent experiments also validate the effectiveness of our approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3010736536,"Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) is a multi-functional glycosylated peptide present in the plasma of healthy women postpartum and increased further in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Although the STC-1 gene is expressed by the placenta what regulates its secretion and from which cells at the feto-maternal interface is unknown. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast are a major site of STC-1 protein expression in first trimester placental tissue. Further, in response to low oxygen, first trimester chorionic villous tissue from pregnancies at increased risk of developing preeclampsia secreted significantly more STC-1 than normal tissue under the same conditions. Using the human trophoblast cell line BeWo we have shown that low oxygen increased the secretion of STC-1 but it required co-stimulation with the Adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analogue, 8-Bromo adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate cAMP (8 Br-cAMP) to reach significance. Inhibition of Hypoxia inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) and the Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-Kinase)/AKT/Serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1(SGK-1) pathway resulted in significant inhibition of STC-1 secretion. As both low oxygen and cAMP are known to play a central role in placental function, their regulation of STC-1 points to a potentially important role in the maintenance of a normal healthy pregnancy and we would hypothesize that it may act to protect against prolonged placental hypoxia seen in preeclampsia."
https://openalex.org/W3011916792,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the normal arterial media continually express contractile phenotypic markers which are reduced dramatically in response to injury. Tripartite motif-containing proteins are a family of scaffold proteins shown to regulate gene silencing, cell growth, and differentiation. We here investigated the biological role of tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28) and tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) in VSMCs. We observed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRIM28 and TRIM27 inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced migration in human VSMCs. Both TRIM28 and TRIM27 can regulate serum response element activity and were required for maintaining the contractile gene expression in human VSMCs. At the same time, TRIM28 and TRIM27 knockdown reduced the expression of PDGF receptor-β (PDGFRβ) and the phosphorylation of its downstream signaling components. Immunoprecipitation showed that TRIM28 formed complexes with TRIM27 through its N-terminal RING-B boxes-Coiled-Coil domain. Furthermore, TRIM28 and TRIM27 were shown to be upregulated and mediate the VSMC contractile marker gene and PDGFRβ expression in differentiating human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In conclusion, we identified that TRIM28 and TRIM27 cooperatively maintain the endogenous expression of PDGFRβ and contractile phenotype of human VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W3011704714,"Pathogenic bacteria often damage tissues by secreting toxins that form pores in cell membranes, and the most common pore-forming toxins are cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. During bacterial infections, glutamine becomes a conditionally essential amino acid, and glutamine is an important nutrient for immune cells. However, the role of glutamine in protecting tissue cells against pore-forming toxins is unclear. Here we tested the hypothesis that glutamine supports the protection of tissue cells against the damage caused by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. Stromal and epithelial cells were sensitive to damage by the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, pyolysin and streptolysin O, as determined by leakage of potassium and lactate dehydrogenase from cells, and reduced cell viability. However, glutamine deprivation increased the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and reduced the viability of cells challenged with cholesterol-dependent cytolysins. Without glutamine, stromal cells challenged with pyolysin leaked lactate dehydrogenase (control vs. pyolysin, 2.6 ± 0.6 vs. 34.4 ± 4.5 AU, n = 12), which was more than three-fold the leakage from cells supplied with 2 mM glutamine (control vs. pyolysin, 2.2 ± 0.3 vs. 9.4 ± 1.0 AU). Glutamine cytoprotection did not depend on glutaminolysis, replenishing the Krebs cycle via succinate, changes in cellular cholesterol, or regulators of cell metabolism (AMPK and mTOR). In conclusion, although the mechanism remains elusive, we found that glutamine supports the protection of tissue cells against the damage caused by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3010908909,"Milling properties and flour color are essential selection criteria in soft wheat breeding. However, high phenotypic screening costs restrict selection to relatively few breeding lines in late generations. To achieve marker-based selection of these traits in early generations, we performed genetic dissection of quality traits using three doubled haploid populations that shared the high-quality soft wheat variety Kitahonami as the paternal parent. An amplicon sequencing approach allowed effective construction of well-saturated linkage maps of the populations. Marker-based heritability estimates revealed that target quality traits had relatively high values, indicating the possibility of selection in early generations. Taking advantage of Chinese Spring reference sequences, joint linkage maps of the three populations were generated. Based on the maps, multifamily quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed a total of 86 QTLs for ten traits investigated. In terms of target quality traits, 12 QTLs were detected for flour yield, and 12 were detected for flour redness (a* value). Among these QTLs, six for flour yield and nine for flour a* were segregating in more than two populations. Some relationships among traits were explained by QTL collocations on chromosomes, especially group 7 chromosomes. Ten different ideotypes with various combinations of favorable alleles for the flour yield and flour a* QTLs were generated. Phenotypes of derivatives from these ideotypes were predicted to design ideal genotypes for high-quality wheat. Simulations revealed the possibility of breeding varieties with better quality than Kitahonami."

Dietary supplementation of pregnant women with (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was shown to exert beneficial effects on offspring, through yet unknown mechanisms. Here, we conducted a dietary intervention study on a cohort of 10 women diagnosed with threatened preterm labor with a nutritional integration with eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Microvesicles (MV) isolated form arterial cord blood of the treated cohort offspring and also of a randomized selection of 10 untreated preterm and 12 term newborns, were characterized by dynamic light scattering and analyzed by proteomic and statistical analysis. Glutathione synthetase was the protein bearing the highest discrimination ability between cohorts. ELISA assay showed that glutathione synthetase was more abundant in cord blood from untreated preterm compared to the other conditions. Assay of free SH-groups showed that serum of preterm subjects was oxidized. Data suggest that preterm suffer from oxidative stress, which was lower in the treated cohort. This study confirms that MV are a representative sample of the individual status and the efficacy of dietary intervention with PUFA in human pregnancy in terms of lowered inflammatory status, increased gestational age and weight at birth."
https://openalex.org/W3010911876,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is the leading cause of reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and apoptosis in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Ursodeoxycholyl lysophosphatidylethanolamide (UDCA-LPE) is a hepatotargeted agent that exerts hepatoprotective roles by regulating lipid metabolism. Our previous studies have shown that UDCA-LPE improves hepatic I/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation. However, the role of UDCA-LPE in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function in hepatic I/R remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of UDCA-LPE in hepatic I/R by focusing on the interface of phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis. Livers from 28-week-old mice, primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells were subjected to in vivo and in vitro I/R, respectively. Analyses of oxidative stress, imaging, ATP generation, genetics, and lipidomics showed that I/R was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and a reduction in phospholipids. UDCA-LPE alleviated mitochondria-dependent oxidative stress and apoptosis and prevented the decrease of phospholipid levels. Our study found that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), a phospholipase that is activated during I/R, hydrolyzed mitochondrial membrane phospholipids and led to mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress and apoptosis. UDCA-LPE inhibited the interaction between cPLA2 and mitochondria and reduced phospholipid hydrolysis-mediated injury. UDCA-LPE might regulate the crosstalk between the phospholipid metabolism and the mitochondria, restore mitochondrial function and ameliorate I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W3012091821,"Purpose 
Rapid, intra-operative identification of tumor tissue in the margins of excised specimens has become an important focus in the pursuit of reducing re-excision rates, especially for breast conserving surgery. Dual-probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI) is an emerging approach that uses the difference in uptake/clearance kinetics between a pair of fluorescently-labeled stains, one targeted to a biomarker-of-interest and the other an untargeted isotype, to reveal receptor-specific images of the specimen. Previous studies using antibodies labeled with either enhanced Raman particles or organic fluorophores have shown promising tumor vs. normal diagnostic performance. Yet, the unique properties of quantum dot-labeled antibody complexes (QDACs), which provide spectrally-distinct fluorescence emission from a common excitation source, make them ideal candidates for this application. Herein, we evaluate the diagnostic performance of QDAC-based DDSI in excised xenografts.


Procedures 
Excised fresh specimens of normal tissue and human tumor xenografts with elevated expression of HER2 were stained with a HER2-targeted QDAC and an untargeted QDAC isotype. Stained specimens were imaged on a custom hyperspectral imaging system capable of spectrally separating the quantum dot signatures, and images processed using the DDSI approach. The diagnostic performance of this technique under different incubation temperatures and probe concentrations was evaluated using receiver-operator characteristic analysis.


Results 
HER2-targeted QDAC-DDSI was able to distinguish HER2(+) tumors from normal tissue with reasonably high diagnostic performance; however, this performance was sensitive to temperature during the staining procedure. Area under the curve values were 0.61 when staining at room temperature but increased to over 0.81 when staining at 37 °C. Diagnostic performance was not affected by increasing stain concentration.


Conclusions 
This study is the first to report dual-probe difference imaging of specimens using QDACs and hyperspectral imaging. Our results show promising diagnostic performance under certain conditions, and compel further optimization and evaluation of this intra-operative margin assessment technique."
https://openalex.org/W3012135543,"Background Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum (TPA) and subsp. endemicum (TEN) are the causative agents of syphilis and bejel, respectively. TEN shows similar clinical manifestations and is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from TPA. Recently, bejel was found outside of its assumed endemic areas. Using molecular typing we aimed to discover bejel and characterize circulating TPA types among syphilis cases with Surinamese, Antillean and Dutch ethnicity in Amsterdam. Methods DNA was extracted from 137 ulcer swabs, which tested positive in the in-house diagnostic PCR targeting the polA gene. Samples were collected between 2006 and 2018 from Surinamese, Antillean and Dutch patients attending the Amsterdam STI clinic. Multilocus sequence typing was performed by partial sequence analysis of the tp0136, tp0548 and tp0705 genes. In addition, the 23S rRNA loci were analyzed for A2058G and A2059G macrolide resistance mutations. Results We found 17 distinct allelic profiles in 103/137 (75%) fully typed samples, which were all TPA and none TEN. Of the strains, 82.5% were SS14-like and 17.5% Nichols-like. The prevalence of Nichols-like strains found in this study is relatively high compared to nearby countries. The most prevalent types were 1.3.1 (42%) and 1.1.1 (19%), in concordance with similar TPA typing studies. The majority of the TPA types found were unique per country. New allelic types (7) and profiles (10) were found. The successfully sequenced 23S rRNA loci from 123/137 (90%) samples showed the presence of 79% A2058G and 2% A2059G mutations. Conclusions No TEN was found in the samples from different ethnicities residing in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, so no misdiagnoses occurred. Bejel has thus not (yet) spread as a sexually transmitted disease in the Netherlands. The strain diversity found in this study reflects the local male STI clinic population which is a diverse, mixed group."
https://openalex.org/W3011525336,"The Amphiprion (anemonefish or clownfish) family of teleost fish, which is not a common model species, exhibits multiple unique characteristics, including social control of body size and protandrous sex change. The social changes in sex and body size are modulated by neuropeptide signaling pathways. These neuropeptides are formed from complex processing from larger prohormone proteins; understanding the neuropeptide complement requires information on complete prohormones sequences. Genome and transcriptome information within and across 22 teleost fish species, including 11 Amphiprion species, were assembled and integrated to achieve the first comprehensive survey of their prohormone genes. This information enabled the identification of 175 prohormone isoforms from 159 prohormone proteins across all species. This included identification of 9 CART prepropeptide genes and the loss of insulin-like 5B and tachykinin precursor 1B genes in Pomacentridae species. Transcriptome assemblies generally detected most prohormone genes but provided fewer prohormone genes than genome assemblies due to the lack of expression of prohormone genes or specific isoforms and tissue sampled. Comparisons between duplicate genes indicated that subfunctionalization, degradation, and neofunctionalization may be occurring between all copies. Characterization of the prohormone complement lays the foundation for future peptidomic investigation of the molecular basis of social physiology and behavior in the teleost fish."
https://openalex.org/W3011009582,"The steady state distributions of phenotypic responses within an isogenic population of cells result from both deterministic and stochastic characteristics of biochemical networks. A biochemical network can be characterized by a multidimensional potential landscape based on the distribution of responses and a diffusion matrix of the correlated dynamic fluctuations between N-numbers of intracellular network variables. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic description of biological networks at the level of microscopic interactions between network variables. The Boltzmann H-function defines the rate of free energy dissipation of a network system and provides a framework for determining the heat associated with the nonequilibrium steady state and its network components. The magnitudes of the landscape gradients and the dynamic correlated fluctuations of network variables are experimentally accessible. We describe the use of Fokker-Planck dynamics to calculate housekeeping heat from the experimental data by a method that we refer to as Thermo-FP. The method provides insight into the composition of the network and the relative thermodynamic contributions from network components. We surmise that these thermodynamic quantities allow determination of the relative importance of network components to overall network control. We conjecture that there is an upper limit to the rate of dissipative heat produced by a biological system that is associated with system size or modularity, and we show that the dissipative heat has a lower bound."

Despite a high potential of targeting GluK2 and/or GluK2/GluK5 for therapeutic intervention, developing potent antagonists for GluK2 and GluK2/GluK5 has thus far met with significant difficulties. It should be noted that the full-length GluK2 complexed with an agonist has been determined by the use of cryo-EM at 7.6 Å resolution (32Mayer M.L. Ghosal A. Dolman N.P. Jane D.E. Crystal structures of the kainate receptor GluR5 ligand binding core dimer with novel GluR5-selective antagonists.J.

Frydenvang K. Pickering D.S. Kastrup J.S. Lessons from crystal structures of kainate receptors.Neuropharmacology. 2017; 112 (27236079): 16-2810.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.05.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, no crystal structure of GluK2 bound with any antagonist has been reported. Therefore, generating small-molecule compounds as potential drug candidates targeting GluK2 or GluK2-containing channels by the use of structure-based ligand discovery has been just as elusive. Here we report an RNA inhibitor or RNA aptamer, termed AB9s-b. This aptamer shows a micromolar potency in inhibiting the GluK2 kainate receptor subunit and also GluK2/GluK5 channels. AB9s-b has been derived from aptamer AB9 originally discovered from a large RNA library (∼1014 sequence variations) by the use of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (33Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands.Nature. 1990; 346 (1697402): 818-82210.1038/346818a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (6979) Google Scholar, 34Tuerk C. Gold L.

RNA aptamers as potential regulatory agents and drug candidates have some unique properties as compared with traditional, small-molecule compounds (35Huang Z. Niu L. Developing RNA aptamers for potential treatment of neurological diseases.Future Med. Chem. 2019; 11 (30912676): 551-56510.4155/fmc-2018-0364Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 36Kaur H.

RNA aptamers are water-soluble and in general show higher potency and selectivity. To make these RNA aptamers amenable for in vivo use, we have also developed its chemically modified aptamer, FB9s-b, with satisfactory in vitro stability in the presence of ribonucleases, as in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As an alternative to synthetic chemistry, which yields small molecule inhibitors, we have previously used SELEX to “evolve” RNA molecules bound to target from a large library (∼1014 sequence variations). In particular, we have isolated a class of potent aptamers targeting AMPA receptors (38Huang Z. Han Y. Wang C. Niu L.

In these SELEX experiments, we expressed an AMPA receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells and used the membrane fragments that contain AMPA receptors as the target. A typical SELEX operation in our case involves about a dozen of cycles, and each cycle is composed of RNA binding, elution of the bound RNA molecules, RT-PCR, and regeneration of an enriched RNA library for the next cycle (33Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands.Nature. 1990; 346 (1697402): 818-82210.1038/346818a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (6979) Google Scholar, 34Tuerk C. Gold L.

Eventually, molecular cloning and sequencing technique can be used to identify the RNA molecules evolved from these repeated cycles of enrichment. RNAs that exhibit identical or virtually identical sequences are candidates of functional importance. We then carry out a functional assay to screen all of these candidate RNAs to identify those that are capable of inhibiting the target. Despite our success in using SELEX to isolate desired AMPA receptor RNA aptamers, as described above, we have not yet been able to reproduce our success in isolating useful RNA aptamers against GluK2 kainate receptor. 3J. S. Park, Z. Huang, and L. Niu, unpublished data. In the current study, we decided to use a recently isolated RNA aptamer with dual activities on both AMPA and kainate receptors (41Jaremko W.J. Huang Z. Wen W. Wu A. Karl N. Niu L. Identification and characterization of RNA aptamers: a long aptamer blocks the AMPA receptor and a short aptamer blocks both AMPA and kainate receptors.J. Biol.

The aptamer with the dual activity, termed AB9s, is a functionally active RNA with 55 nucleotides derived from its parent RNA or AB9 aptamer with 101 nucleotides (41Jaremko W.J. Huang Z. Wen W. Wu A. Karl N. Niu L. Identification and characterization of RNA aptamers: a long aptamer blocks the AMPA receptor and a short aptamer blocks both AMPA and kainate receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (28325839): 7338-734710.1074/jbc.M116.774752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). During the truncation of the original or full sequence to generate the minimal but functional sequence, we noticed two main, secondary sequence segments or domains, which we indicate as red and blue sequences (Fig. 1A). We have also found that some RNA sequences between the two domains can be removed without affecting the function of the shorter RNAs (41Jaremko W.J. Huang Z. Wen W. Wu A. Karl N. Niu L. Identification and characterization of RNA aptamers: a long aptamer blocks the AMPA receptor and a short aptamer blocks both AMPA and kainate receptors.J. Biol.

As such, two single-domain RNA mutants would function separately in inhibiting AMPA and kainate receptors. In other words, one mutant would only inhibit AMPA, whereas the other mutant would only inhibit kainate receptors. To test this hypothesis, we created two mutants, termed AB9s-r and AB9s-b, based on the sequence and the MFold-predicted structure of AB9s (Fig. 1, A and B). In constructing these two mutants, we also used the MFold program (42Zuker M. Mfold web server for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 (12824337): 3406-341510.1093/nar/gkg595Crossref PubMed Scopus (9695) Google Scholar) to ensure that a mutant was still able to uphold the same secondary structure as the original AB9s (see Fig. 1B and its legend for additional description). We reasoned that both the sequence and the secondary structural motif that surrounds a stretch of the sequence would be essential for the function of the mutant RNA. As shown in Fig. 1, the resulting Mfold structure of AB9s-b is similar to that of AB9s. However, a different set of sequences had to be used to keep the blue region in AB9s-r the same fold as in AB9s. We then characterized the impact of individual mutations, by using whole-cell recording, on a panel of NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptor subunits. AB9s-b and AB9s-r, along with AB9s, were prepared by enzymatic transcription. Each RNA was purified using a PAGE column (43Huang Z. Jayaseelan S. Hebert J. Seo H. Niu L. Single-nucleotide resolution of RNAs up to 59 nucleotides by high-performance liquid chromatography.Anal. Biochem. 2013; 435 (23274387): 35-4310.1016/j.ab.2012.12.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The putative activity of an RNA was characterized using whole-cell recording with HEK-293 cells expressing individual subunit of glutamate ion channel receptors. As shown by a pair of representative glutamate-induced whole-cell current traces, the amplitude of whole-cell current response was reduced in the presence of a functional aptamer inhibitor. Based on the ratio of the whole-cell current amplitude in the absence and presence of an aptamer, A/A(I), as a function of aptamer concentration, we further determined the inhibition constant, KI, by using Equations 1 and 2 (“Experimental procedures”). It should be noted that at a lower concentration of glutamate, most of the receptors in a receptor population would be in the closed-channel state, whereas at a saturating concentration of glutamate, virtually all the receptor channels would be in the open-channel state (44Li G. Niu L. How fast does the GluR1Qflip channel open?.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14610080): 3990-399710.1074/jbc.M310410200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As such, by using different glutamate concentrations, we were able to determine the potency of an aptamer for both the closed- and the open-channel state or form. For example, KI for AB9s-r with the closed-channel state of GluA2Qflip was found to be 4.1 ± 0.5 μm (Fig. 2B, left panel, solid symbols). However, AB9s-r did not in"

Methods Hyperglycaemic participants in noncritical care units were divided into two groups. They underwent active intervention by the hospital’s blood glucose management team or the routine consultation group. The better method, based on a shorter length of stay (LOS) and lower hospital cost, could be selected by comparing the two blood glucose management strategies. Results Compared with the routine consultation group, the team management group had a higher detection rate of hyperglycaemia (18.49% vs 16.17%, P<0.01) and glycosylated haemoglobin (51.53% vs 30.97%, P<0.01) and a lower incidence rate of hyperglycaemia (59.24% vs 61.59%, P<0.01), severe hyperglycaemia (3.56% vs 5.19%, P<0.01) and clinically significant hypoglycaemia (0.26% vs 0.35%, P<0.05). Simultaneously, blood glucose drift (mmol/L) (2.50 (1.83, 3.25) vs 2.76 (2.01, 3.57), P<0.01), blood glucose coefficient of variation (%) (28.86 (22.70, 34.83) vs 29.80 (23.47, 36.13), P<0.01), maximum blood glucose fluctuation (mmol/L) (9.30 (6.20, 13.10) vs 10.10 (7.00, 14.40), P<0.01) and nosocomial infection (5.42% vs 8.05%, P<0.05) were all lower among participants in the team management group. In addition, the LOS (P<0.001) and hospital costs (P<0.001) of participants were lower in the team management group. Conclusion In-hospital blood glucose team management combined with a network blood glucose monitoring system effectively improved the blood glucose control and fluctuation levels of participants who were admitted to noncritical care units, thereby reducing LOS and hospital cost."

https://openalex.org/W3012211244,"Recent studies concerning left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) suggest that the extent of left ventricular (LV) hypertrabeculation has no impact on prognosis. The variety of methods of LV noncompacted myocardial mass (NCM) assessment may influence the results. Hence, we compared two methods of NCM estimation: largely observer-independent Hautvast's(H) computed algorithm-based approach and commonly used Jacquier's(J) method, and their associations with LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and ejection fraction (EF).Cardiac magnetic resonance images of 77 persons (45±17yo) - 42 LVNC, 15 non-ischemic dilative cardiomyopathy, 20 control group were analyzed. LVNC patients were divided into the subgroup with normal (LVNCN) and high EDV (LVNCDCM). NCM and total left ventricular mass (LVM) were estimated by Hautvast's [excluding intertrabecular blood (ITB) and including papillary muscles (PMs) into NCM] and Jacquier's approach (including ITB and PMs, if unclearly distinguished, into NCM).The cut-off value of NCM for LVNC diagnosis was 22% (AUC 0.933) for NCMH/LVMH and 26% (AUC 0.883) for NCMJ/LVMJ. Inter- and intra-observer variability (estimated by coefficient of variation [CoV] and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) of NCMH/LVMH appeared better than of NCMJ/LVMJ (CoV 4.3%, ICC 0.981 and CoV 4.9%, ICC 0.978; respectively for NCMH/LVMH, while for NCMJ/LVMJ: CoV 19.7%, ICC 0.15 and CoV 12.9%, ICC 0.504). In LVNCN subgroup, the correlation between EDV and NCMH was stronger than NCMJ (r = 0.677, p<0.001 vs. r = 0.480, p = 0.038; respectively). In LVNC the EDV correlated with NCMH/LVMH (r = 0.391, p<0.01), but not with NCMJ/LVMJ. In the overall group a relationship was present between EF and NCMH/LVMH (r = -0.449, p<0.001), but not NCMJ/LVMJ. Only NCMH/LVMH explained the variability of EDV (b 0.434, p<0.001).Choosing a method of NCM assessment that is less observer-dependent might increase the reliability of results. The impact of method selection on the LV parameters and cut-off values for hypertrabeculation should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W3010926920,"Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is a sleep-disordered breathing characterized by recurrent central apneas alternating with hyperventilation exhibiting a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of tidal volume. This respiration is reported in patients with heart failure, stroke or damage in respiratory centers. It increases mortality for patients with severe heart failure as it has adverse impacts on the cardiac function. Early stage of CSR, also called periodic breathing, is often undiagnosed as it only provokes hypopneas instead of apneas, which are much more difficult to detect. This paper demonstrates the proof of concept of a new method devoted to the early detection of CSR. The proposed approach relies on a signal demodulation technique applied to ventilation signals measured on 15 patients with chronic heart failure whose respiration goes from normal to severe CSR. Based on a modulation index and its instantaneous frequency, oscillation zones are detected and classified into three categories: CSR, periodic breathing and no abnormal pattern. The modulation index is used as an efficient indicator to quantify the degree of certainty of the pathology for each patient. Results show high correlation with experts' annotations with sensitivity and specificity values of 87.1% and 89.8% respectively. A final decision leads to a classification which is confirmed by the experts' conclusions."
