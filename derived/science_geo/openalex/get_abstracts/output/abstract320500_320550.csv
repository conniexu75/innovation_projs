The fat body of males failed to do so, as did that of females before the appearance of these proteins in the blood."

https://openalex.org/W1980339984,Sex pheromone specificity is the only obvious reproduction isolating mechanism for two tortricid species and two gelechiid species. Pheromones of the gelechiid species are cis-9-tetradecenyl acetate and trans-9-tetradecenyl acetate. Male response of one gelechiid species is inhibited by the pheromone of the other species. This could be important for sympatric evolutionary saltation.

This relatively small difference in chemical weathering rates suggests that atmospheric CO(2), pressures no greater than five times the present value were needed to sustain present-day rates of chemical weathering before the development of higher land plants in the Silurian."

The course of risinig sea level in the Canal Zone during the past 11,300 years is calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2104158737,A new technique has been developed whereby fission tracks can be etched in zircon with a solution of sodiuim hydroxide at 220 degrees C. Etching time varied between 15 minutes and 5 houtrs. Colored zircon required less etching time than the colorless varieties.

The results indicate that the exospheric temperature from 300 degrees K to 600 degrees K during the solar cycle, with a corresponding range on Venus of 450 degrees K to 850 degrees K. At the present time, the temperature of the Martain exosphere should be approximately 500 degrees K."

The hopefulness of undertaking to find arsenical and mercurial organic compounds which might be better than anything yet known for the treatment of syphilis of the central nervous system has been justified, and this is provoking greater optimism for the furture. So much promising study is in sight that enthusiasm among the group in increasingly evident at each meeting. It is hoped that this plain recital of the story of a working cooperative scientific research, with its implied disppointments and reverses, as well as with its successes, may prove to be the needed stimulus to the inauguration of similar efforts elsewhere."
