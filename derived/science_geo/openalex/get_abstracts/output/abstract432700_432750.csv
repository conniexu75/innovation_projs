https://openalex.org/W2038686775,"Ancient Genomics The Denisovans were archaic humans closely related to Neandertals, whose populations overlapped with the ancestors of modern-day humans. Using a single-stranded library preparation method, Meyer et al. (p. 222 , published online 30 August) provide a detailed analysis of a high-quality Denisovan genome. The genomic sequence provides evidence for very low rates of heterozygosity in the Denisova, probably not because of recent inbreeding, but instead because of a small population size. The genome sequence also illuminates the relationships between humans and archaics, including Neandertals, and establishes a catalog of genetic changes within the human lineage."

Soil organisms have long been assumed to be an important source of antibiotic resistance genes, in part because of antibiotic-treated livestock and in part because of the natural ecology of antibiotic production in the soil. Forsberg et al. (p. 1107 ) developed a metagenomic protocol to assemble short-read sequence data after antibiotic selection experiments, using 12 different drugs in all antibiotic classes, and compared antibiotic resistance gene sequences between soil bacteria and clinically occurring pathogens. Sixteen sequences, representing seven gene products, were discovered in farmland soil bacteria within long stretches of perfect nucleotide identity with pathogenic proteobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2091531174,"Transcription Around the Clock The biological clock that controls daily rhythms in mammalian physiology and behavior is thought to be regulated in large part by transcriptional events (see the Perspective by Doherty and Kay ). Koike et al. (p. 349 ; published online 30 August) produced a comprehensive analysis of these transcriptional events across the entire mouse liver genome over a 24-hour period. Only ∼22% of cycling messenger RNA transcripts were driven by de novo transcription, suggesting that posttranscriptional events also play an important regulatory role in the mammalian clock. Biological timing in organisms can also respond to rhythmic cues from the environment. Morf et al. (p. 379 , published online 23 August) explored how one such cue, cycles in ambient temperature, influence circadian timing in mammalian cells. Cold-inducible RNA–binding protein (CIRP) accumulates when body temperature is low. A systematic search for binding partners of CIRP identified RNA encoding core components of the circadian clock. Loss of CIRP decreased the amplitude of circadian gene expression and cells lacking CIRP adapted more quickly to temperature cycles."

This focusing and enhancement of the optical field maybe useful in sensing, nonlinear optics, and optical scattering applications. In probing the properties of metallic nanoparticles, Ciracì et al. (p. 1072 ; see the cover) show that the enhancement is limited by the electronic response of the metal, which has implications for the ultimate performance of nanophotonic systems."

When black carbon is emitted, it combines with other aerosols to form heterogeneous mixtures. Models have predicted that internal mixing of black carbon with other materials can double the amount of radiation absorbed. Cappa et al. (p. 1078 ) report that in situ measurements of the enhancement of radiation absorption by these mixed black carbon–containing particles in the atmosphere show a much smaller effect. Thus, many climate models may be overestimating the amount of warming caused by black carbon emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2080805933,"Ethylene gas is essential for many developmental processes and stress responses in plants. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2), an NRAMP-like integral membrane protein, plays an essential role in ethylene signaling, but its function remains enigmatic. Here we report that phosphorylation-regulated proteolytic processing of EIN2 triggers its endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-nucleus translocation. ER-tethered EIN2 shows CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1 (CTR1) kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Ethylene triggers dephosphorylation at several sites and proteolytic cleavage at one of these sites, resulting in nuclear translocation of a carboxyl-terminal EIN2 fragment (EIN2-C'). Mutations that mimic EIN2 dephosphorylation, or inactivate CTR1, show constitutive cleavage and nuclear localization of EIN2-C' and EIN3 and EIN3-LIKE1-dependent activation of ethylene responses. These findings uncover a mechanism of subcellular communication whereby ethylene stimulates phosphorylation-dependent cleavage and nuclear movement of the EIN2-C' peptide, linking hormone perception and signaling components in the ER with nuclear-localized transcriptional regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2072751749,"A Fungal Culprit to Carbon Loss In some ecosystems, such as in the layer of soil containing plant roots, fungi, and bacteria, increased levels of CO 2 should stimulate more efficient aboveground photosynthesis, which in turn should promote increased sequestration of organic carbon in soil through the protective action of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. However, in a series of field and microcosm experiments performed under elevated levels of CO 2 thought to be consistent with future emissions scenarios, Cheng et al. (p. 1084 ; see the Perspective by Kowalchuk ) observed that these fungi actually promote degradation of soil organic carbon, releasing more CO 2 in the process."
https://openalex.org/W2043512838,"A premature stop codon in the DMRT3 gene has a major effect on the pattern of locomotion in horses, and the Dmrt3 transcription factor is critical in the development of a coordinated locomotor network in mice, suggesting that it has an important role in configuring the spinal circuits that control stride. Some horses — notably the harness-racing American Standardbred and the all-terrain Icelandic breed — have the ability to perform extra gaits. All horses can walk, trot, canter and gallop, but some can also 'pace' — moving the two legs on the same side of the body in unison — and/or perform other novel ambling gaits. A genome-wide association analysis of Icelandic horses has identified linkage between a premature stop codon in the DMRT3 gene and the ability to perform alternative gaits. Functional studies in mice show that Dmrt3 is expressed in a subset of spinal cord neurons that are crucial for the normal development of a coordinated locomotor network that controlling limb movements. Dmrt3 may therefore have a key role in configuring the spinal circuits that control stride in vertebrates. In the domestic horses, the DMRT3 mutation has had a major impact on the creatures' diversification, because the altered gait characteristics of a number of breeds apparently require this mutation. Locomotion in mammals relies on a central pattern-generating circuitry of spinal interneurons established during development that coordinates limb movement1. These networks produce left–right alternation of limbs as well as coordinated activation of flexor and extensor muscles2. Here we show that a premature stop codon in the DMRT3 gene has a major effect on the pattern of locomotion in horses. The mutation is permissive for the ability to perform alternate gaits and has a favourable effect on harness racing performance. Examination of wild-type and Dmrt3-null mice demonstrates that Dmrt3 is expressed in the dI6 subdivision of spinal cord neurons, takes part in neuronal specification within this subdivision, and is critical for the normal development of a coordinated locomotor network controlling limb movements. Our discovery positions Dmrt3 in a pivotal role for configuring the spinal circuits controlling stride in vertebrates. The DMRT3 mutation has had a major effect on the diversification of the domestic horse, as the altered gait characteristics of a number of breeds apparently require this mutation."

Based on data from the Kepler space telescope, Orosz et al. (p. 1511 , published online 28 August) report the detection of a pair of planets orbiting a pair of stars. These two planets are the smallest of the known transiting circumbinary planets and have the shortest and longest orbital periods. The outer planet resides in the habitable zone—the “goldilocks” region where the temperatures could allow liquid water to exist. This discovery establishes that, despite the chaotic environment around a close binary star, a system of planets can form and persist."
https://openalex.org/W2130118109,"The helical coiling of plant tendrils has fascinated scientists for centuries, yet the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Moreover, despite Darwin's widely accepted interpretation of coiled tendrils as soft springs, their mechanical behavior remains unknown. Our experiments on cucumber tendrils demonstrate that tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction of an internal fiber ribbon of specialized cells. Under tension, both extracted fiber ribbons and old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather than unwinding, with an initially soft response followed by strong strain-stiffening at large extensions. We explain this behavior using physical models of prestrained rubber strips, geometric arguments, and mathematical models of elastic filaments. Collectively, our study illuminates the origin of tendril coiling, quantifies Darwin's original proposal, and suggests designs for biomimetic twistless springs with tunable mechanical responses."
https://openalex.org/W1988241218,"Keeping DNA Flexible The elastic behavior of DNA is important to biological processes that involve DNA bending and looping. However, there has been considerable debate over the flexibility of DNA at lengths below the persistence length (around 150 base pairs). A widely used approximation, the wormlike chain model, predicts stiff short DNA. Vafabakhsh and Ha (p. 1097 ; see the Perspective by Nelson ) directly monitored cyclization of single molecules of DNA, by using a fluorescence assay, and found significant looping, with the looping rate having only weak length dependence between 67 and 105 bp, which is inconsistent with the wormlike chain model. Instead, DNA binding proteins may stabilize transiently bent or looped DNA conformations."

If it is, then its catabolism by microrganisms seeking phosphorus might explain the ubiquity of methane in the oceans. Anaerobic Archaea, so far, are the only significant source of methane known. Thus, Metcalf et al. (p. 1104 ) looked for evidence of methylphosphonate biochemistry in the widespread archaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus. The organism can synthesize C-P bonds using phosphoenolpyruvate mutase. By using its gene, ppm , as a marker, a possible phosphonate biosynthesis gene cluster was identified, and adjacent to this a gene for a cupin was found. Together with Fe(II) and O 2 the cupin catalyzed the production of methylphosphonate and formate. Homologs of the cupin gene are found in a wide range of common marine microbes, including Pelagibacter ubique and Prochlorococcus."

https://openalex.org/W2005900492,"Human aminopeptidase N (hAPN/hCD13) is a dimeric membrane protein and a member of the M1 family of zinc metallopeptidases. Within the rennin-angiotensin system, its enzymatic activity is responsible for processing peptide hormones angiotensin III and IV. In addition, hAPN is also involved in cell adhesion, endocytosis, and signal transduction and it is an important target for cancer therapy. Reported here are the high resolution x-ray crystal structures of the dimeric ectodomain of hAPN and its complexes with angiotensin IV and the peptidomimetic inhibitors, amastatin and bestatin. Each monomer of the dimer is found in what has been termed the closed form in other M1 enzymes and each monomer is characterized by an internal cavity surrounding the catalytic site as well as a unique substrate/inhibitor-dependent loop ordering, which in the case of the bestatin complex suggests a new route to inhibitor design. The hAPN structure provides the first example of a dimeric M1 family member and the observed structural features, in conjunction with a model for the open form, provide novel insights into the mechanism of peptide processing and signal transduction."

LptD is an essential β-barrel protein that contains two disulfide bonds between nonconsecutive cysteines. Chng et al. (p. 1665 , published online 30 August) describe the characterization of the oxidative folding and assembly pathway of LptD/E in living cells. A combination of steady-state and pulse-chase measurements was used to identify seven intermediates with different disulfide-bonded states, along the oxidative folding pathway. During folding and assembly, a non-native disulfide-bonded LptD intermediate accumulated and, triggered by β-barrel assembly and association with the lipoprotein LptE, rearranged to the native disulfide-bonded state required for lipopolysaccharide export. Thus, disulfide bond–dependent protein folding can involve the proper assembly of a two-protein complex in order to promote disulfide bond rearrangement."

Here we show the modulation by clock genes of chondrogenic differentiation through gene transactivation of the master regulator of chondrogenesis Indian hedgehog (IHH) in chondrocytes of the growth plate. Several clock genes were expressed with oscillatory rhythmicity in cultured chondrocytes and rib growth plate in mice, whereas chondrogenesis was markedly inhibited in stable transfectants of Per1 in chondrocytic ATDC5 cells and in rib growth plate chondrocytes from mice deficient of brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1). Ihh promoter activity was regulated by different clock gene products, with clear circadian rhythmicity in expression profiles of Ihh in the growth plate. In BMAL1-null mice, a predominant decrease was seen in Ihh expression in the growth plate with a smaller body size than in wild-type mice. BMAL1 deficit led to disruption of the rhythmic expression profiles of both Per1 and Ihh in the growth plate. A clear rhythmicity was seen with Ihh expression in ATDC5 cells exposed to dexamethasone. In young mice defective of BMAL1 exclusively in chondrocytes, similar abnormalities were found in bone growth and Ihh expression.

Accordingly, the prevailing view is that the central SCN clock acts as a synchronizer rather than an essential master regulator of peripheral rhythmic oscillations. In peripheral tissues, oscillatory rhythmicity may be under the direct control by clock gene products locally expressed (6Yoo S.H. Yamazaki S. Lowrey P.L. Shimomura K. Ko C.H. Buhr E.D. Siepka S.M.

In mice, the rhythmic transactivation of Period (Per) gene seems to be essential for the generation of circadian rhythms. Expression of mouse Per genes is positively regulated by other clock gene products belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix period/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator/single minded class, which are CLOCK and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (BMAL1), respectively. In addition, mouse PER proteins constitute multimeric complexes with products of Cryptochrome (Cry) genes such as Cry1 and Cry2, which in turn negatively regulate the gene transcription mediated by the BMAL1/CLOCK complex after binding to BMAL1 C terminus. The PER/CRY repressor complex is ubiquitinylated for degradation by the proteasomal pathway, and then the BMAL1/CLOCK complex activates a new transcriptional cycle with oscillatory rhythmicity (7Gekakis N.

Bone is precisely orchestrated by different cells through a well organized and highly regulated mechanism, where mesenchymal precursor cells differentiate into skeletal elements by forming a cartilaginous model during embryogenesis toward bone formation in the vertebral column and long bone (14Karsenty G. The complexities of skeletal biology.Nature. 2003; 423: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Through this endochondral ossification process, the cartilaginous rudiment, which is a tightly regulated area of chondrocytic differentiation for maturation, undergoes developmental growth during skeletogenesis. Within the cartilaginous rudiment, chondrocytes differentiate, progressing through the resting, proliferating, hypertrophic, and calcifying stages, which leads to mineralization of the cartilage matrix around the central region of the rudiment in the area enriched of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Shortly after the mineralization process takes place, most hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo sustained apoptosis. Upon apoptotic death of hypertrophic chondrocytes after mineralization, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and capillaries begin to invade the cartilage matrix to produce new bone, leading to the longitudinal bone elongation (15Kronenberg H.M. Developmental regulation of the growth plate.Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). These sequential differentiation steps are not only under the control of essential transcription factors such as SRY-type HMG box 9 (SOX9) and runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) (15Kronenberg H.M.

Bmal1+/fl mice and α1(II)-collagen-Cre mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6J at least seven and six times, respectively. Tibial sections prepared from 1-day-old neonatal mice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, washed with PBS, treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, and washed with 70% ethanol for 5 min. After washing with PBS, sections were subjected to blocking with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. Sections were then reacted with an antibody against BMAL1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or CLOCK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:200 with the same blocking buffer at room temperature overnight followed by reaction with a biotinylated anti-goat IgG antibody at room temperature for 30 min and subsequent incubation with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. Finally, immunostaining was done using 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2. For the culture of chondrocytes, cartilages were isolated from neonatal mouse ribs followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.3% collagenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and subsequent digestion with DMEM containing 0.3% collagenase for 6 h. Supernatants obtained by the second digestion were collected and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min. The resultant pellets were suspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in appropriate dishes and then cultured for different periods at 37 °C under 5% CO2. After 1 day in culture, culture medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 1 mm pyruvate, and 1 mm cysteine for subsequent culturing for different periods. Culture medium was changed every 2 days. Chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank. ATDC5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F12) (Invitrogen) containing 5% FBS. For induction of differentiation, culture medium were replaced with medium containing 10 μg/ml transferrin, 30 nm sodium selenite, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). To evaluate the possible circadian rhythmicity of Ihh expression in primary cultured costal chondrocytes, cells were prepared from ribs of neonatal Bmal1+/+ mice followed by culture for 14 days and subsequent exposure to 100 μm dexamethasone (Dex) for 2 h to synchronize cellular differentiation stages during culture. After medium change, total RNA was extracted for determination of Ihh levels every 4 h for 48 h after the addition of Dex by real time-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis described below. For the analysis of cells with homologous biological activities rather than primary cells, prechondrogenic ATDC5 cells were similarly exposed to 100 μm Dex for 2 h toward subsequent determination of temporal Ihh expression profiles. RT-PCR was conducted as described previously (19Hinoi E. Ueshima T. Hojo H. Iemata M. Takarada T. Yoneda Y.

After 24 h, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length coding region of Per1 or with empty vector (EV) using 2 μg of DNA and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, and every 48 h thereafter for 2 weeks, culture medium were replaced with DMEM/F12 containing 5% FBS and 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Pools of 28 clones of ATDC5 cells resistant to G418 (ATDC5-PER1) were isolated for further studies. Pools of clones between passages 2 and 5 were used for these experiments. Mouse Clock, Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2 and hamster Bmal1 expression plasmids were kindly donated by Dr. Reppert (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Per1-Luc reporter plasmid containing the 5′-flanking region of mouse Per1 gene (−1803/+40) was kindly provided by Dr. Paolo Sassone-Corsi (University of California, Irvine, CA). Reporter plasmids for mouse Ihh promoter were prepared as follows. Mouse Ihh promoter was at first obtained by cloning with the forward primer 5′-CTCGAG(XhoI site)-GTGACTTTCCACAAGCACCCA-3′ (−2380 to −2361) and the reverse primer 5′-AAGCTT(HindIII site)-CGGACTCAAGGGACCCGCGG-3′ (+61 to +80) with mouse tail genomic DNA. The mouse Ihh promoter fragment (−2380 to +80) was cloned into the promoterless pGL-3 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to create the recombinant plasmid −2380/+80 Ihh-Luc. The deletion mutant of Ihh promoter plasmid was made from the recombinant plasmid −2380/+80 Ihh-Luc (−1792/+80 IHH-Luc and −1129/+80 Ihh-Luc) by using restriction enzyme and T4 DNA polymerase. Reporter vectors were co-transfected with a SV40-Renilla luciferase construct into ATDC5 cells or human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using specific substrates in a luminometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by determining the activity of Renilla luciferase. Transfection was also conducted into ATDC5 cells by the electroporation method using the NucleofectorTM according to the manufacturer's protocol (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) as needed. For the measurement of matrix proteoglycan synthesis, cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 1% Alcian blue 8GS solution (Sigma). Staining intensity was finally quantified using the computer program Scion Image. Determination of ALP activity was done as described previously (24Takarada T. Hinoi E. Takahata Y. Yoneda Y. Serine racemase suppresses chondrogenic differentiation in cartilage in a Sox9-dependent manner.J. Cell Physiol. 2008; 215: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by determination of the ALP activity in lysates using p-nitrophenol phosphate as a substrate. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Cell proliferation analysis was performed by determining the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (26Takarada T. Takahata Y.

The LV backbone vector and three helper plasmids (pRSV-REV, pMDLg/pRRE, and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-expressing plasmid) were kindly provided by Dr. Südhof (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). A short hairpin sequence targeting the mouse Per1 mRNA (5′-TCGACCCCCGAATACACACTTCGAAATTCAAGAGATTTCGAAGTGTGTATTCGGTTTTTGGAAAT-3′) was inserted into the XhoI-XbaI sites downstream of the H1 promoter. Full-length cDNAs for mouse BMAL1 and mouse CLOCK were cloned into LV backbone vector. LV was produced as described previously (27Pang Z.P. Cao P. Xu W. Südhof T.C.

LV vector, pRSV-REV, pMDLg/pRRE, and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-expressing plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293T cells (RIKEN, Saitama, Japan) at 10, 2.5, 5, and 3 μg of DNA per 56.7-cm2 culture area, respectively, using the calcium phosphate method. At 24 h after transfection, the HEK293T culture medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% FBS followed by culture for 48 h and subsequent collection of culture medium. The collected culture medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant containing LV particles was directly added to the culture medium for primary chondrocytes. Cultured chondrocytes were infected on day 6 for the analysis on day 14. All experimental steps were performed under the level II bio-safety conditions. ATDC5 cells were treated with formaldehyde for cross-linking followed by sonication in lysis buffer containing several protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-CLOCK antibody followed by extraction of DNA with phenol/chloroform. PCR was performed using sequences found in the 5′-flanking region (−2400 to −2175, upstream 5′-GGATTGAACCCAAGGCTTTTT-3′, downstream, 5′-AGATCTTTAGAAACTGACATT-3′; −1281 to −1092, upstream 5′-GGTTTCCTTTGGTAGAGGAA-3′, downstream, 5′-CTCCGTAGGTGAGAGACTCC-3′) of mouse Ihh as primers. Neonatal mouse tibiae were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution followed by decalcification with 20% EDTA and subsequent immersion in 30% sucrose. Tibiae were then dissected for frozen sections with a thickness of 10 μm in a cryostat. In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (25Takarada T. Hojo H. Iemata M. Sahara K.

Results are all expressed as the mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined by two-tailed and unpaired Students' t test or one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's/Dunnett's post hoc test. In cultured costal chondrocytes from rib cartilage of neonatal Std-ddY mice, constitutive mRNA expression was seen for all clock genes examined irrespective of culture durations of 7 or 21 days on RT-PCR analysis performed at 32 cycles (Fig. 1A). These included Bmal1, Clock, Per1, Per2, Per3, Cry1, Cry2, the basic helix-loop-helix proteins differentiated embryo chondrocyte 1 (Dec1) and Dec2, D site of albumin promoter-binding protein (Dbp), and Rev-erbα. 3-week-old male mice were bred under 12-h light and dark cycle conditions for a week followed by extraction of total RNA from rib growth plates at different times after the final light cycle initiation for real time-based RT-PCR analysis on Per1, Bmal1, and Clock. Statistically significant rhythmicity was found with expression profiles of both Per1 and Bmal1 in mouse rib growth plates with maximum expression at ZT12 for Per1 and ZT4 for Bmal1, respectively (Fig. 1B). By contrast, no significant rhythmic expression was observed in Clock in mouse rib growth plates.

In this study, we examined the effects of PPARα activation on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway in human breast (MCF-7) and ovarian (A2780) cancer cells under hypoxia. Incubation of cancer cells under 1% oxygen for 16 h significantly induced HIF-1α expression and activity as assayed by Western blotting and reporter gene analysis. Treatment of the cells with PPARα agonists, but not a PPARγ agonist, prior to hypoxia diminished hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression and activity, and addition of a PPARα antagonist attenuated the suppression of HIF-1α signaling. Activation of PPARα attenuated hypoxia-induced HA-tagged HIF-1α protein expression without affecting the HA-tagged HIF-1α mutant protein level, indicating that PPARα activation promotes HIF-1α degradation in these cells. This was further confirmed using proteasome inhibitors, which reversed PPARα-mediated suppression of HIF-1α expression under hypoxia. Using the co-immunoprecipitation technique, we found that activation of PPARα enhances the binding of HIF-1α to von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL), a protein known to mediate HIF-1α degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Following PPARα-mediated suppression of HIF-1α signaling, VEGF secretion from the cancer cells was significantly reduced, and tube formation by endothelial cells was dramatically impaired. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that activation of PPARα suppresses hypoxia-induced HIF-1α signaling in cancer cells, providing novel insight into the anticancer properties of PPARα agonists.

https://openalex.org/W2034450932,"The peptide hormone hepcidin regulates mammalian iron homeostasis by blocking ferroportin-mediated iron export from macrophages and the duodenum. During inflammation, hepcidin is strongly induced by interleukin 6, eventually leading to the anemia of chronic disease. Here we show that hepatoma cells and primary hepatocytes strongly up-regulate hepcidin when exposed to low concentrations of H(2)O(2) (0.3-6 μM), concentrations that are comparable with levels of H(2)O(2) released by inflammatory cells. In contrast, bolus treatment of H(2)O(2) has no effect at low concentrations and even suppresses hepcidin at concentrations of >50 μM. H(2)O(2) treatment synergistically stimulates hepcidin promoter activity in combination with recombinant interleukin-6 or bone morphogenetic protein-6 and in a manner that requires a functional STAT3-responsive element. The H(2)O(2)-mediated hepcidin induction requires STAT3 phosphorylation and is effectively blocked by siRNA-mediated STAT3 silencing, overexpression of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling 3), and antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine. Glycoprotein 130 (gp130) is required for H(2)O(2) responsiveness, and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) is required for adequate basal signaling, whereas Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is dispensable upstream of STAT3. Importantly, hepcidin levels are also increased by intracellular H(2)O(2) released from the respiratory chain in the presence of rotenone or antimycin A. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of hepcidin regulation by nanomolar levels of sustained H(2)O(2). Thus, similar to cytokines, H(2)O(2) provides an important regulatory link between inflammation and iron metabolism."

Recently, ASPP 049, a diarylheptanoid isolated from Curcuma comosa Roxb., has been identified as a phytoestrogen. This investigation determined the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the estrogenic activity of this diarylheptanoid in transfected HEK 293T and in mouse preosteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) cells using a TOPflash luciferase assay and immunofluorescence. ASPP 049 rapidly activated T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor-mediated transcription activity and induced β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus. Interestingly, the effects of ASPP 049 on the transcriptional activity and induction and accumulation of β-catenin protein in the nucleus of MC3T3-E1 cells were greater compared with estradiol. Activation of β-catenin in MC3T3-E1 cells was inhibited by ICI 182,780, suggesting that an estrogen receptor is required. In addition, ASPP 049 induced phosphorylations at serine 473 of Akt and serine 9 of GSK-3β. Moreover, ASPP 049 also induced proliferation and expressions of Wnt target genes Axin2 and Runx2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, ASPP 049 increased alkaline phosphatase expression, and activity that was abolished by DKK-1, a blocker of the Wnt/β-catenin receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that ASPP 049 from C. comosa induced osteoblastic cell proliferation and differentiation through ERα-, Akt-, and GSK-3β-dependent activation of β-catenin signaling. Our findings provide a scientific rationale for using C. comosa as a dietary supplement to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women."

https://openalex.org/W2095465114,"The solute carrier 6 (SLC6) is a family of ion-dependent transporters that mediate uptake into the cell of osmolytes such as neurotransmitters and amino acids. Four SLC6 members transport GABA, a key neurotransmitter that triggers inhibitory signaling pathways via various receptors (e.g., GABA(A)). The GABA transporters (GATs) regulate the concentration of GABA available for signaling and are thus targeted by a variety of anticonvulsant and relaxant drugs. Here, we characterize GAT-2, a transporter that plays a role in peripheral GABAergic mechanisms, by constructing comparative structural models based on crystallographic structures of the leucine transporter LeuT. Models of GAT-2 in two different conformations were constructed and experimentally validated, using site-directed mutagenesis. Computational screening of 594,166 compounds including drugs, metabolites, and fragment-like molecules from the ZINC database revealed distinct ligands for the two GAT-2 models. 31 small molecules, including high scoring compounds and molecules chemically related to known and predicted GAT-2 ligands, were experimentally tested in inhibition assays. Twelve ligands were found, six of which were chemically novel (e.g., homotaurine). Our results suggest that GAT-2 is a high selectivity/low affinity transporter that is resistant to inhibition by typical GABAergic inhibitors. Finally, we compared the binding site of GAT-2 with those of other SLC6 members, including the norepinephrine transporter and other GATs, to identify ligand specificity determinants for this family. Our combined approach may be useful for characterizing interactions between small molecules and other membrane proteins, as well as for describing substrate specificities in other protein families."

Aberrant ALK signaling can arise, however, through the amplification or mutation of the full-length protein and ALK has been identified as a driver oncogene in a subset of neuroblastomas, an aggressive form of childhood cancer that originates in the sympathetic nervous system (28Mossé Y.P.

Germline mutations of the ALK gene contribute to many hereditary neuroblastomas, and somatic mutations and gene amplifications contribute to a subset of sporadic neuroblastomas.

As with the ALK fusion proteins, the neuroblastoma activating mutants are amenable to inhibition by small molecule inhibitors of the ALK kinase activity, although differential sensitivity has been observed depending on the particular inhibitor and mutant (33Schönherr C.

Interestingly, the F1174L variant and the related F1174C variant have been independently identified in the clinic as a mutations conferring resistance to crizotinib treatment (36Sasaki T. Okuda K.

A structural understanding of inhibitor binding to ALK was recently enabled by the publication of crystal structures of the ALK kinase domain both alone and in complex with ATP-competitive inhibitors (38Lee C.C. Jia Y. Li N. Sun X. Ng K. Ambing E. Gao M.Y. Hua S. Chen C. Kim S. Michellys P.Y. Lesley S.A. Harris J.L. Spraggon G.

Crystal structures of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in complex with ATP competitive inhibitors.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 6813-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The structures revealed that the ALK kinase domain adopts the canonical kinase-fold, but that it also contains two notable features. First, a portion of the juxtamembrane region forms a β-hairpin turn that packs against the αC-helix from the N-terminal domain of the kinase. Second, the activation loop (A-loop) forms a short, α-helix that packs against the αC-helix. This helical A-loop conformation has been observed in nearly all ALK crystal structures published to date and its conformation is incompatible with an active kinase. Importantly, all of the published ALK crystal structures use unphosphorylated protein. Interactions of the A-loop α-helix with both the N-terminal and C-terminal lobes of the kinase and a hydrogen bond between Tyr1278 and Cys1097 from the N-terminal β-turn motif serve to stabilize the observed conformation. The fact that Tyr1278 is phosphorylated upon formation of fully activated ALK underscores the inactive nature of the observed structures (40Donella-Deana A. Marin O. Cesaro L. Gunby R.H. Ferrarese A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 3743-3750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fully activated ALK kinase is expected to resemble the activated form of the insulin receptor kinase (IRK), the structure of which has been reported previously using the Tris-phosphorylated IRK kinase domain crystallized with a substrate peptide and an ATP analog (42Hubbard S.R. Crystal structure of the activated insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in complex with peptide substrate and ATP analog.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Several structural features of the published, unphosphorylated ALK kinase domain differ from the structural template provided by the IRK ternary structure and interestingly, ALK also differs from the unphosphorylated, inactive form of IRK kinase domain (43Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor.Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). These differences have been described elsewhere (38Lee C.C. Jia Y. Li N. Sun X. Ng K. Ambing E. Gao M.Y. Hua S. Chen C. Kim S. Michellys P.Y. Lesley S.A. Harris J.L. Spraggon G.

Small molecule inhibition of ALK kinase activity is a promising means of treatment in NSCLC, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and other cancers with an ALK-driven component. Based on this knowledge, we and others have pursued programs to discover novel, small-molecule inhibitors of ALK that are suitable for clinical application. During the course of these investigations, we sought to understand the structural basis for activation of ALK by the two most common neuroblastoma mutants, F1174L and R1275Q. We report here crystal structures of both mutants and we use the published structure of the ALK-crizotinib complex to show that these mutants produce no steric impediment to crizotinib binding (19Cui J.J. Tran-Dubé M. Shen H. Nambu M. Kung P.P. Pairish M. Jia L. Meng J. Funk L. Botrous I. McTigue M. Grodsky N. Ryan K. Padrique E. Alton G. Timofeevski S. Yamazaki S. Li Q. Zou H. Christensen J. Mroczkowski B. Bender S. Kania R.S. Edwards M.P. Structure based drug design of crizotinib (PF-02341066), a potent and selective dual inhibitor of mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) kinase and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).J. Med. Chem. 2011; 54: 6342-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In addition, during the course of our medicinal chemistry efforts two other classes of ALK inhibitors were identified that stabilized the ALK A-loop in previously unobserved conformations. The crystal structure of ALK in complex with one such compound bound to ALK in a classic type II configuration is reported here. Type II kinase inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding site and also occupy a largely hydrophobic pocket formed by shifting the activation loop to an inactive, DFG-out conformation. In contrast, type I inhibitors occupy the ATP-binding site of the kinase in its active, DFG-in conformation (44Liu Y. Gray N.S. Rational design of inhibitors that bind to inactive kinase conformations.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). A second series of compounds was identified that bound to a unique, DFG-shifted conformation of the enzyme (45Bryan M.C. Whittington D.A. Doherty E.M. Falsey J.R. Cheng A.C. Emkey R. Brake R.L. Lewis R.T. Rapid development of piperidine carboxamides as potent and selective anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2012; 55: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also included in this report is the strategy that we used to obtain ALK kinase domain crystals. The structures reported herein provide novel views of the ALK active site that may prove useful for structure-based drug design of a new generation of ALK inhibitors, they provide a detailed view of the binding of crizotinib to the most common neuroblastoma activating mutants, and they also provide insight into the activating nature of the R1275Q mutant. Plasmids encoding recombinant ALK proteins were constructed using modified pFastBac1 vectors (Invitrogen). The pFastBac1 G2T vector allows the fusion of a GST affinity tag and a thrombin protease cleavage site to the N terminus of target proteins, whereas the pFastBac HGT vector carries a His6 and GST dual affinity tag followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. A human ALK DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1060–1620 was amplified from a human cDNA library (Clontech), digested with restriction enzymes BglII and EcoRI, and cloned into a pFastBac1 G2T vector between the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The resulting plasmid pFastBac1 G2T-ALK(1060–1620) was used as a DNA template for the downstream cloning. pFastBac1 G2T-ALK(1058–1410) and pFastBac1 HGT-ALK(1084–1410) were made by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments ALK(1058–1410) and ALK(1084–1410) into pFastBac1 G2T and pFastBac1 HGT vectors, respectively. Finally, C1097S, F1174L, and R1275Q substitutions were introduced into expression constructs by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). ALK proteins were expressed using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Briefly, expression plasmids were transformed into DH10Bac competent cells (Invitrogen) and selected on LB agar plates containing kanamycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and Bluo-gal. The resulting single white colonies were used to generate recombinant BacMid DNA, which was then used to transfect Sf9 cells to generate recombinant baculovirus stocks. After two rounds of amplification, high-titer baculoviruses were used to express recombinant ALK proteins by infecting mid-log phase Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Insect cells were allowed to grow in serum-free sfx medium (Hyclone) for an additional 64 h at 27 °C. Insect cells expressing G2T-ALK(1058–1410), HGT-ALK(1084–1410)C1097S, HGT-ALK(1084–1410)C1097S/F1174L, or HGT-ALK(1084–1410)C1097S/R1275Q (∼100 g of frozen cell pellets) were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% w/v glycerol, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) (Sigma), 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), disrupted in a microfluidizer operating at 9,000 psi (Microfluidics, Inc.), and centrifuged in a 19 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) at 19,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GS4B; GE Healthcare) for several hours at 4 °C with gentle rocking.

Functional studies and more recently structural studies of Kir channels have revealed the major impact of PIP2 on the open state stabilization. A similar effect of PIP2 on the delayed rectifiers Kv7.1 and Kv11.1, two voltage-gated K+ channels, has been suggested, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive and nothing is known on PIP2 effect on other Kv such as those of the Shaker family. By combining giant-patch ionic and gating current recordings in COS-7 cells, and voltage-clamp fluorimetry in Xenopus oocytes, both heterologously expressing the voltage-dependent Shaker channel, we show that PIP2 exerts 1) a gain-of-function effect on the maximal current amplitude, consistent with a stabilization of the open state and 2) a loss-of-function effect by positive-shifting the activation voltage dependence, most likely through a direct effect on the voltage sensor movement, as illustrated by molecular dynamics simulations.

https://openalex.org/W2054136034,"[FeFe]-hydrogenases are iron-sulfur proteins characterized by a complex active site, the H-cluster, whose assembly requires three conserved maturases. HydE and HydG are radical S-adenosylmethionine enzymes that chemically modify a H-cluster precursor on HydF, a GTPase with a dual role of scaffold on which this precursor is synthesized, and carrier to transfer it to the hydrogenase. Coordinate structural and functional relationships between HydF and the two other maturases are crucial for the H-cluster assembly. However, to date only qualitative analysis of this protein network have been provided. In this work we showed that the interactions of HydE and HydG with HydF are distinct events, likely occurring in a precise functional order driven by different kinetic properties, independently of the HydF GTPase activity, which is instead involved in the dissociation of the maturases from the scaffold. We also found that HydF is able to interact with the hydrogenase only when co-expressed with the two other maturases, indicating that under these conditions it harbors per se all the structural elements needed to transfer the H-cluster precursor, thus completing the maturation process. These results open new working perspectives aimed at improving the knowledge of how these complex metalloenzymes are biosynthesized."

This novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transducer is localized in the ER and is cleaved in its transmembrane region in response to ER stress. BBF2H7 has been shown to be expressed in proliferating chondrocytes in cartilage during the development of long bones. The target of BBF2H7 is Sec23a, one of the coat protein complex II components. Bbf2h7-deficient (Bbf2h7−/−) mice exhibit severe chondrodysplasia, with expansion of the rough ER in proliferating chondrocytes caused by impaired secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We observed a decrease in the number of proliferating chondrocytes in the cartilage of Bbf2h7−/− mice. TUNEL staining of the cartilage showed that apoptosis was promoted in Bbf2h7−/− chondrocytes. Atf5 (activating transcription factor 5), another member of the CREB/ATF family and an antiapoptotic factor, was also found to be a target of BBF2H7 in chondrocytes. ATF5 activated the transcription of Mcl1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1), which belongs to the antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 family, to suppress apoptosis. Finally, we found that the BBF2H7-ATF5-MCL1 pathway specifically suppressed ER stress-induced apoptosis in chondrocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate that BBF2H7 is activated in response to ER stress caused by synthesis of abundant ECM proteins and plays crucial roles as a bifunctional regulator to accelerate ECM protein secretion and suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating the ATF5-MCL1 pathway during chondrogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2063452973,"Inactivation of FoxO proteins by phosphorylation is the result of a number of stimuli, including the insulin/IGF pathway. We were interested in the consequence of blunting this pathway by employing transgenic mice with tetracycline-controllable conditional expression of a constitutively active allele of FOXO3 under the control of the forebrain-specific CaMKIIα promoter. Although transgene-expressing mice were viable, brain weight was reduced by 30% in adult animals. Brains showed an isocortex compression with normal cortical layering, and a size reduction in regions known to depend on adult neurogenesis, i.e., the olfactory bulbs and the dentate gyrus. On postnatal activation of the transgene, adult neurogenesis was also severely affected. Investigating the molecular basis of this phenotype, we observed enhanced apoptosis starting from embryonic day E10.5 and a subsequent loss of progenitors in the ventricular/subventricular zones, but not in the isocortex or the striatum of adult mice. The enhanced apoptosis was accompanied by increased expression of PIK3IP1, which we identified as a direct transcriptional target of FOXO3. Transfection of Pik3ip1 into differentiating neural progenitors resulted in a significant reduction of viable cells. We therefore conclude that neural progenitors are particularly vulnerable to FOXO3-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by PIK3IP1, a negative PI3 kinase regulator.—Schmidt-Strassburger, U., Schips, T.

https://openalex.org/W2046980687,"Rituximab is reported to inhibit the proliferation of lymphoma cells through an unknown CD20-mediated signal transduction pathway. Herein, we investigated cell surface molecules involved in the CD20-mediated signal transduction pathway by using a recently developed technique named enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources. Using this method, we found that under stimulation with rituximab and another anti-CD20 antibody B-Ly1, CD20 was physically associated with fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) as well as some other receptor tyrosine kinases in Raji cells. However, under stimulation with a noncytotoxic anti-CD20 antibody 2H7, CD20 was not associated with FGFR3 but with the PDGF receptor β.

These observations raise the possibility that concomitant targeted therapy toward FGFR3 might improve the efficacy and safety of the rituximab therapy. Targeted therapy has been developed for the last 2 decades and has made remarkable progress. It is categorized into two types, one being small molecules and the other being monoclonal antibodies. Now we have several successful therapeutic antibodies, such as alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), trastuzumab (Herceptin®), and rituximab (Rituxan®) (1White C.A. Weaver R.L. Grillo-López A.J. Antibody-targeted immunotherapy for treatment of malignancy.Annu. Rev. Med. 2001; 52: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Waldmann T.A. Immunotherapy. Past, present, and future.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These therapeutic antibodies are supposed to work mainly by mediating two immune reactions, namely the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). However, alternative mechanisms are also involved in the action of the therapeutic antibodies. For instance, antibodies bind to their antigen receptors as a ligand and induce pharmacological effects such as cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. These antibodies are called a “signaling antibody” and are applied to clinical therapy (3Cragg M.S. French R.R. Glennie M.J. Signaling antibodies in cancer therapy.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, their action mechanisms remain to be elucidated in many signaling antibodies. Identifying the signal molecules associated with their antigen receptors may be useful for solving this problem. We focused on rituximab in this study because it is one of the most successful therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma (4Press O.W. Appelbaum F. Ledbetter J.A. Martin P.J.

The target of rituximab is CD20 expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphoma cells. Rituximab is reported to inhibit proliferation of lymphoma cells through the CD20-mediated signal transduction pathway (7Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside. Ways to improve rituximab efficacy.Blood. 2004; 104: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), although the pharmacological effect of rituximab is considered to be mainly mediated by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (7Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside. Ways to improve rituximab efficacy.Blood. 2004; 104: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that rituximab is a signaling antibody. However, little is known about which signaling molecules participate in the rituximab-stimulated CD20 pathway. CD20 is a member of the membrane-spanning 4A family. Its genuine molecular function is unclear, although it is implicated as a Ca2+ transporter. Because membrane-spanning proteins are robustly associated with the plasma membrane, their cross-linking with antibody may affect the organization of the membrane structure. Actually, rituximab treatment brings about the translocation of CD20 into the lipid raft fraction (7Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside.

This reorganization of the membrane structure results in the formation of a transmembrane signal cluster, including CD20, which may initiate a signal transduction pathway leading to cytotoxicity (supplemental Fig. 1). A similar situation is observed in the immunoreceptors, which form a functional transmembrane cluster under stimulation and subsequently generate immune reaction signals (9Horejsí V. Zhang W. Schraven B. Transmembrane adaptor proteins. Organizers of immunoreceptor signaling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this study, we propose a strategy to explore cell surface signal molecules to modulate the action of rituximab, using the enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources (EMARS) 3The abbreviations used are: EMARSenzyme-mediated activation of radical sourceRTKreceptor tyrosine kinaseFGFRβFGF receptor β. reaction (10Kotani N.

This reaction is useful for the identification of molecules coming close to the target molecule under stimulation.

In the Burkitt lymphoma cell line, Raji and BJAB cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. Rituximab, which was a generous gift from Zenyaku-Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan), mouse monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody 2H7 (Gene Tex), and mouse monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody B-Ly1 (Abcam) were conjugated to HRP using a peroxidase labeling kit NH2 (Dojindo) following the manufacturer's instruction. Rituximab and 2H7 antibodies were labeled with FITC (Sigma) and Alexa 647-carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen), respectively, and subsequently purified using a G-50-Sepharose spin column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove excess labeling reagent. In the case of rabbit anti-FGFR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling) for Western blot, the antibody was labeled with Zenon HRP labeling kit for rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Raji and BJAB cells (1 × 107) were washed once with PBS at 37 °C, and then were treated with 10 μg of rituximab-HRP, 2H7-HRP, and B-Ly1-HRP in PBS at 37 °C for 15 or 30 min, respectively. After washing, the cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml EZ-Link Biotin-LC-ASA (Thermo) in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, the treated cells were mixed with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The cell suspension was homogenized using disposable syringe equipped with a 21-gauge needle. Next, the homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to mainly precipitate the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to precipitate what is generally called the “microsome fraction,” containing the plasma membrane fractions. After washing the precipitates with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the precipitates were then dissolved in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol. An aliquot of the lysate corresponding to 3 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gel, under a nonreducing condition) and blotted onto a PVDF membrane using iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). After washing, the membranes were stained with an ABC detection kit (Vector Laboratories) and developed with an Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore). 5 μg of rituximab-HRP, 2H7-HRP, and B-Ly1-HRP samples from Raji cells (each incubation time was 15 min) were applied to Proteome ProfilerTM human phospho-RTK array and human phospho-immunoreceptor array (R&D Systems) following the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the array was stained with an ABC detection kit and developed as described above. The detailed array coordinates are shown on the manufacturer's web page. To confirm the FGFR3 expression level under each antibody treatment, 2H7 or rituximab-treated Raji cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using HRP-labeled anti-FGFR3 antibody as described above. Raji cells (1 × 106) were simultaneously treated with 1 μg of fluorescein-labeled rituximab and Alexa 647-labeled 2H7 antibody at 37 °C for 15 min. The treated cells were washed with PBS and then observed with a confocal laser scan microscopy (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus), including differential interference contrast image. Raji cells (2 × 107) were washed once with PBS and then treated with or without 20 μg of rituximab and 2H7 antibody in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min, respectively. The cells were subsequently treated with 0.2 mg/ml EZ-link sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce) in PBS at 37 °C for 15 min. After washing with Tris-buffered saline to quench the reaction, the cells were lysed with a detergent-containing buffer for lipid raft extraction (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai)) followed by incubation on ice for 20 min. The mixtures were subsequently homogenized using a glass homogenizer and 10 strokes. The homogenized samples were mixed with 80% sucrose solution resulting in the final concentration of 40% sucrose. The solution was transferred to a centrifugation tube, and the discontinuous sucrose density gradient was prepared by layering successively two decreasing sucrose density solutions (30 and 5% sucrose solution) onto this sample solution. The gradient solution was centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C by using Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifugal unit equipped with TLS-55 swing rotor. After centrifugation, the 3rd to 6th fractions from the top (total of 12 fractions; 200 μl/fraction) were collected. 50 μl of each fraction was mixed with 300 μl of the lipid raft lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% glycerol) and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to lyse the lipid raft. The mixtures were applied to Proteome ProfilerTM human phospho-RTK array, respectively. Raji cells were treated with or without PD173074, 1-tert-butyl-3-[6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-diethylaminobutylamino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl]-urea (10 or 30 nm; Sigma), in culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h. After treatment, the cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-FGFR3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Ab-capture protein A-Sepharose (Protenova) at 4 °C for overnight. The immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% gel, under a reducing condition) followed by blotting onto PVDF membrane. The membrane was first treated with HRP-conjugated 4G10 platinum antibody (Millipore). After washing, the membranes were developed with an Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). After stripping the antibody with Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo), the same membrane was treated with HRP-labeled anti-FGFR3 antibody as described above. After washing, the membranes were developed. Each Western signal was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Raji and BJAB cells (3 × 104 cells/ml) were treated with or without 10 or 30 nm PD173074 in culture medium at 37 °C for 2 h. After treatment, rituximab, 2H7, or B-Ly1 (1 μg/ml) were separately added. The plate was cultured at 37 °C under humidified air containing 5% CO2. After 3 days, the cells were harvested and suspended in 0.5% trypan blue/PBS solution, and living cell numbers were counted using the cell counting chamber under microscopy. In addition, these cells were also observed with IMT-2 phase contrast microscopy equipped with a DP-12 digital camera unit (Olympus). The knockdown sequences of FGFR3, CGACAAGGAGCTAGAGGTT (Takara), and the negative control sequence, TCTTAATCGCGTATAAGGC (Takara), with the hairpin sequence were inserted into the pSINsi-hU6 retrovirus vector (Takara) at BamHI and ClaI ligation sites, respectively, following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and the transfected cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The supernatant was collected and treated with Raji cells (1.5 × 106 cells in 6-cm culture dish) for 48 h. After treatment, the cells were diluted with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and G418 (800 μg/ml), and cultured in a 24-well culture plate. The colonies grown on the plate were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FGFR3 antibody to select appropriate FGFR3 knockdown cells. Raji and BJAB cells (5 × 106 cells) were treated with or without 30 nm PD173074 in culture medium at 37 °C for 2–2.5 h. After treatment, the cells were collected and treated with or without rituximab (5 μg). The cells were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min. Each cell sample was lysed with lysis buffer, and then the rituximab-CD20 complex was isolated with Dynabeads-protein A (Invitrogen). The purified samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gel, under a reducing condition). The gel was stained with flamingo gel stain solution (Bio-Rad) to see the total protein. The same samples were also subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel, under a reducing condition) followed by blotting onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was treated with HRP-conjugated 4G10 platinum antibody (Millipore). After washing, the membranes were developed with an Immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). After stripping the antibody with Western blot stripping buffer, the same PVDF membrane was re-stained with rabbit anti-CD20 antibody (1:1000; Thermo) and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000; Promega). Because distinct anti-CD20 antibodies exhibit diverse functionality in terms of proliferation of B-cell lymphoma cells (15Deans J.P. Li H. Polyak M.J. CD20-mediated apoptosis. Signaling through lipid rafts.Immunology. 2002; 107: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), it was assumed that CD20 forms different transmembrane signal cluster complexes to send distinct signals under stimulation with these antibodies. To investigate the cell surface molecules associated with CD20 when rituximab and 2H7 were treated, the EMARS method using HRP-conjugated antibodies was performed. The principle of the EMARS method is shown in supplemental Fig. 2. We separately treated two lines of B-cell lymphoma cells, Raji and BJAB, with HRP-conjugated rituximab or 2H7 antibody at 37 °C for 15 min and then reacted with arylazide biotin under a living condition as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following the EMARS reaction, the membranes were solubilized, and the total protein extract was subjected to Western blot to detect biotinylated molecules. As shown in Fig. 1A, similar biotinylated bands were observed between the rituximab- and 2H7-treated cells in both Raji (upper panel) and BJAB (lower panel) cells, although the intensity of the band at 37 kDa was stronger in the rituximab-treated cells than the 2H7-treated cells. Next, we applied both the rituximab- and 2H7-treated EMARS products to two kinds of antibody array systems for the identification of biotinylated immunoreceptors and RTKs. The analysis using the RTK array revealed that FGFR3, ROR1, and Dtk were predominantly biotinylated in the rituximab-treated Raji cells (rituximab-HRP in Fig. 1B), whereas only PDGF receptor β was weakly labeled in the 2H7-treated Raji cells (2H7-HRP in Fig. 1B). We additionally performed the EMARS method using another anti-CD20 antibody B-Ly1. The RTK antibody array analysis showed a slightly different pattern of labeled molecules, including ErbB4, FGFR3, and Dtk, from that using rituximab (B-Ly1-HRP in Fig. 1B). When analyzed in BJAB cells, the biotinylated RTKs were quite similar to that in Raji cells (Fig. 1C). In the analysis using the immunoreceptor antibody array, CD22, CD23, FcγRIIA, FcRH5, and TREM-2 were predominantly biotinylated in the rituximab-treated Raji cells (rituximab-HRP in Fig. 1D), whereas only CD23 and SHP-2 were labeled in the 2H7-treated Raji cells (2H7-HRP in Fig. 1D). These results indicate that in associated molecules with CD20 under stimulation with rituximab, 2H7 and B-Ly1 are distinct from each other, suggesting that the transmembrane signal transduction assemblies formed by the stimulation with anti-CD20 antibodies vary depending on the antibody clones. To exclude the possibility that stimulation with antibodies affects the expression of FGFR3, we examined expression levels of FGFR3. As the result, we confirmed that there was no effect of mock, rituximab, and 2H7 treatment on the FGFR3 expression level (Fig. 1E). To characterize the difference in the membrane structures between the rituximab-CD20 and the 2H7-CD20 complexes, their localizations were observed with a confocal laser scan microscopy after staining Raji cells simultaneously with fluorescein-labeled rituximab and Alexa 647-labeled 2H7. Although images of rituximab and 2H7 apparently overlapped on the cell surface, some parts were differently stained as green and red spots (Fig. 2A, merge). This observation suggests that rituximab and 2H7 bind CD20 residing at different molecular clusters. Alternatively, the treatments with rituximab and 2H7 may form different molecular clusters around CD20, respectively. It was reported that rituximab treatment results in the translocation of CD20 into the lipid raft fraction (15Deans J.P. Li H. Polyak M.J. CD20-mediated apoptosis. Signaling through lipid rafts.Immunology. 2002; 107: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because the lipid rafts are well known to function as a platform of signal transduction, this reorganization of the membrane structure triggered by rituximab may initiate a signal transduction leading to the proliferation inhibition. To investigate what molecules are transferred into the lipid rafts in response to the rituximab treatment, the detergent-insoluble membrane microdomain fraction was isolated after treatment of Raji cells with or without rituximab and 2H7. Then whole proteins in the detergent-insoluble membrane microdomain fraction were labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin and subjected to the RTKs antibody array. As shown in Fig. 2B, no RTK was detected in the lipid raft fraction from the cells with mock treatment. By contrast, FGFR3 and ROR1 were detected in the rituximab-treated lipid rafts (rituximab), and FGFR3, PDGF receptor β, Flt-3, and MCSF receptors were detected in 2H7-treated lipid rafts (2H7). Thus, FGFR3 was recovered in the lipid raft fraction in both rituximab- and 2H7-treated cells, whereas it was associated only with the rituximab-treated CD20 molecule (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that not 2H7 but rituximab is able to recruit FGFR3 for the CD20-resident cluster, although FGFR3 is transferred into the lipid rafts by stimulation with both antibodies (schematic model is shown in Fig. 2C). Because our EMARS method revealed a physical interaction of FGFR3 and CD20 following the rituximab treatment, we investigated the issue of whether FGFR3 participates in the signal transduction pathway leading to the proliferation inhibition of rituximab-treated B-cell lymphoma cells. To this end, effects of the FGF family kinase inhibitor PD173074 that inhibits FGFR3 in a low concentration (IC50 = 5–10 nm) (16Trudel S. Ely S. Farooqi Y. Affer M. Robbiani D.F. Chesi M.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 332: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was examined. We first confirmed that only FGFR3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated among the FGFR family proteins (FGFR1 to FGFR4) in the rituximab and 2H7-treated Raji cells (data not shown). PD173074 decreased the phosphorylation level of FGFR3 in the range of 10–30 nm (Fig. 3A), indicating that the tyrosine phosphorylation occurred by autophosphorylation. Raji cells pretreated with or without PD173074 were treated with or without rituximab and 2H7 and subsequently cultured in the ordinary growth medium. After 3 days, the number of living cells in each sample was counted. As shown in Fig. 3B, rituximab decreased the number by ∼50% as compared with mock treatment, although 2H7 had no effect (open bars). PD173074 had no effect on cell proliferation and viability of mock-treated and 2H7-treated cells, but attenuated the suppression by the rituximab treatment (rituximab). Furthermore, effects of PD173074 on the morphology of rituximab-treated Raji cells were investigated. As shown in Fig. 3C, rituximab-treated cells were aggregated and damaged (rituximab). In contrast, PD173074-cotreated cells were aggregated but vigorous (rituximab +10 or 30 nm PD173074). These results indicate that the tyrosine kinase activity of FGFR3 modulates the proliferation inhibition by rituximab. PD173074 also attenuated the proliferation inhibition by B-Ly1 in Raji cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast to the observation in Raji cells, PD173074 augmented the proliferation inhibition by rituximab and B-Ly1 treatment in BJAB cells (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, ablation of FGFR3 in Raji cells by a retroviral siRNA knockdown system (Fig. 4A) attenuated the proliferation inhibition by rituximab and B-Ly1 treatment (Fig. 4B) in accordance with the results using PD173074 (Fig. 3, B and D). These results indicated that FGFR3 regulates the rituximab- and B-Ly1-dependent proliferation inhibition in a cell line-dependent manner. To elucidate the mechanism of the rituximab-dependent proliferation inhibition, we first examined whether apoptosis is responsible for it. Raji cells were treated with rituximab and then incubated for 8, 16, and 24 h. Each sample was applied to Western blot analysis using an anti-caspase-3 and an anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cleaved forms of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were not observed at all the incubation times (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that the rituximab-dependent proliferation inhibition is not caused by the classical caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. It was also revealed using an apoptosis antibody array that there is no difference in the levels of apoptotic signal molecules between mock and the rituximab-treated cells (supplemental Fig. 3C). Next, we investigated the effect of the cell cycle phase on rituximab treatment. When Raji and BJAB cells were treated with 1.5% DMSO (see supplemental “Experimental Procedures”), the cell population at the G0 phase was significantly increased in both cell lines (supplemental Fig. 4A). These G0-arrested cells had more resistance against the rituximab treatment (80% survival in Raji cells in supplemental Fig. 4B) than cells not arrested (50% survival in Fig. 3B), indicating that rituximab-induced proliferation inhibition is dependent on the cell cycle phase. To elucidate the role of FGFR3 in the assembly of the rituximab-stimulated CD20 signal complex, effects of the FGFR3 kinase inhibitor PD173074 on the complex formation were time-dependently investigated after addition of rituximab. The rituxuimab-CD20 complex was isolated from the rituximab-treated Raji cells by immunoprecipitation with protein A-immobilized Dynabeads and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining for proteins with a fluorescence reagent. As shown in Fig. 5A, more proteins were detected in the rituximab-CD20 complex in the presence of PD173074. This molecular clustering reached a peak at 15 min after rituximab treatment. Simultaneously, tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules in the complex were examined with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 5B). Phosphorylation signals were more robust in the absence of PD173074 and their intensity reached a peak at 15 min after rituximab treatment. Considering the coincidence of timing between the phosphorylation and the molecular assembly, it was suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of the components in the CD20 complex by FGFR3 prevents the molecular assembly. Because the effects of PD173074 on the cell proliferation were opposite between Raji and BJAB cells (Fig. 3, B and E), a similar experiment for the CD20 complex formation was done using BJAB cells. In contrast to Raji cells, more proteins were observed in the rituximab-CD2"

We recently showed that Bmi-1 and Ezh2 protein level is reduced by treatment with the dietary chemopreventive agents, sulforaphane and green tea polyphenol, and that this reduction involves ubiquitination of Bmi-1 and Ezh2, suggesting a key role of the proteasome. In the present study, we observe a surprising outcome that Bmi-1 and Ezh2 levels are reduced by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. We show that this is associated with a compensatory increase in the level of mRNA encoding proteasome protein subunits in response to MG132 treatment and an increase in proteasome activity. The increase in proteasome subunit level is associated with increased Nrf1 and Nrf2 level. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf1 attenuates the MG132-dependent increase in proteasome subunit expression and restores Bmi-1 and Ezh2 expression. The MG132-dependent loss of Bmi-1 and Ezh2 is associated with reduced cell proliferation, accumulation of cells in G2, and increased apoptosis. These effects are attenuated by forced expression of Bmi-1, suggesting that PcG proteins, consistent with a prosurvival action, may antagonize the action of MG132.

Transcriptional regulation of SEPP1 is directed by the same transcription factors that control the expression of G6PC and PCK1, and these factors are activated by methylation of arginine residues. We sought to determine whether expression of SEPP1 and the aforementioned glucoconeogenic enzymes are regulated by protein methylation, the levels of which are reliant upon adequate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). We treated a human hepatocyte cell line, HepG2, with inhibitors of adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) known to increase concentration of SAH before analysis of G6PC, PCK1, and SEPP1 expression. Increasing SAH decreased 1) the SAM/SAH ratio, 2) protein-arginine methylation, and 3) expression of SEPP1, G6PC, and PCK1 transcripts. Furthermore, hormone-dependent induction of gluconeogenic enzymes was reduced by inhibition of protein methylation. When protein-arginine methyltransferase 1 expression was reduced by siRNA treatment, G6PC expression was inhibited.

https://openalex.org/W2164163897,"Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme of unknown function that is highly expressed in neurons and overexpressed in several human cancers. UCH-L1 has been implicated in the regulation of phenotypic properties associated with malignant cell growth but the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. By comparing cells expressing catalytically active or inactive versions of UCH-L1, we found that the active enzyme enhances cell adhesion, spreading, and migration; inhibits anoikis; and promotes anchorage independent growth. UCH-L1 accumulates at the motile edge of the cell membrane during the initial phases of adhesion, colocalizes with focal adhesion kinase (FAK), p120-catenin, and vinculin, and enhances the formation of focal adhesions, which correlates with enhanced FAK activation. The involvement of UCH-L1 in the regulation of focal adhesions and adherens junctions is supported by coimmunoprecipitation with key components of these complexes, including FAK, paxillin, p120-catenin, β-catenin, and vinculin. UCH-L1 stabilizes focal adhesion signaling in the absence of adhesion, as assessed by reduced caspase-dependent cleavage of FAK following cell detachment and sustained activity of the AKT signaling pathway. These findings offer new insights on the molecular interactions through which the deubiquitinating enzyme regulates the survival, proliferation, and metastatic potential of malignant cells."

Previous studies have demonstrated that Tristetraprolin, a human protein of the TIS11 family, induces the degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs through a large variety of mechanisms including deadenylation, decapping, and P-body targeting. We have previously shown that the degradation of the mRNA encoding the antimicrobial peptide Cecropin A1 (CecA1) is controlled by the TIS11 protein (dTIS11) in Drosophila cells. In this study, we used CecA1 mRNA as a model to investigate the molecular mechanism of dTIS11-mediated mRNA decay. We observed that during the biphasic deadenylation and decay process of this mRNA, dTIS11 enhances deadenylation performed by the CCR4-CAF-NOT complex while the mRNA is still associated with ribosomes. Sequencing of mRNA degradation intermediates revealed that the complete deadenylation of the mRNA triggers its decapping and decay in both the 5′-3′ and the 3′-5′ directions. Contrary to the observations made for its mammalian homologs, overexpression of dTIS11 does not promote the localization of ARE-containing mRNAs in P-bodies but rather decreases the accumulation of CecA1 mRNA in these structures by enhancing the degradation process.

Research into polysaccharide chains and their roles in biology dates back to 1918 when the anti-coagulant heparin was first purified and characterized from the liver (1Jorpes E. The Chemistry of Heparin.Biochem. J. 1935; 29: 1817-1830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since that initial discovery, many essential roles for polysaccharides have been established. Polysaccharide chains comprise the core structure of glycosaminoglycans and are present as O- or N-glycans in proteoglycans as well as in free polymers such as chondroitin, hyaluronan, and heparin (2Esko J.D. Kimata K. Lindahl U. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 229-248Google Scholar). Glycosaminoglycans have been credited with controlling a diverse array of biological processes such as blood coagulation, cell division, adhesion, and bacterial, and viral infections (3Lander A.D. Selleck S.B. The elusive function of proteoglycans. In vivo veritas.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, sulfation confers glycosaminoglycans with divergent biological functions from cell differentiation and morphogenesis (4Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Specificities of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in developmental processes.Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) to fibroblast growth, nervous system, and cartilage development (5Pedersen L.C.

The biosynthetic pathways of glycosaminoglycans are frequently altered in cancer cells; these alterations manifest in an array of forms, providing biological markers for the transformation process and progression of tumor cells (6Varki A.

Given their biological importance, various glycosyltransferases that are involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans have been characterized, and their reaction mechanisms have been determined (7Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Glucosaminylglycan biosynthesis. What we can learn from the x-ray crystal structures of glycosyltransferases GlcAT1 and EXTL2.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The majority of mammalian glycosyltransferases belong to the structural subclass of glycosyltransferases within the GT-A-fold group of enzymes and utilize the catalytic mechanisms for Sn2-type inverting (the α-linkage of the C1-O1 bond in the donor sugar is retained in the reaction product) and Sn1-type retaining (conversion to a β-configuration) transfer reactions (7Negishi M.

Among glycosyltransferases, there are bifunctional glycosyltransferases that polymerize two different sugar molecules into chondroitin, hyaluronan or heparin/heparan chains. Although understanding the reaction mechanism of bifunctional glycosyltransferases is critical to investigating the biological functions and implications of glycosaminolyglycans in diseases, it remains unknown at the present time. Here we have utilized bacterial chondroitin synthase as an enzyme model for glycosaminoglycan chain polymerase to investigate this mechanism of polymerization. Of particular interest is whether or not the two transfer reactions are coordinated in the synthesis of a glucosaminoglycan chain. And if they are coordinated, what is the mechanism? The K4 strain of Escherichia coli-produced chondroitin synthase K4CP is one such bifunctional glycosyltransferase that catalyzes β1–3 glucuronyltransfer and β1–4-N-acetylgalactosaminlytransfer reactions to polymerize glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acteylgalactosamine (GalNAc) into a chondroitin chain [GlcA β(1–3)-GalNAc β(1–4)]n (9Ninomiya T. Sugiura N. Tawada A. Sugimoto K. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Molecular cloning and characterization of chondroitin polymerase from Escherichia coli strain K4.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21567-21575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). K4CP consists of 686 amino acid residues, from which a truncated form was constructed by deleting the first 57 residues from the N terminus to produce K4CPΔ57. This deletion mutant fully retained the enzyme activity of K4CP. The x-ray crystal structure of K4CPΔ57 was recently determined (10Osawa T. Sugiura N. Shimada H. Hirooka R. Tsuji A. Shirakawa T. Fukuyama K. Kimura M. Kimata K. Kakuta Y. Crystal structure of chondroitin polymerase from Escherichia coli K4.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 378: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The K4CPΔ57 structure revealed that K4CP is a single globular protein consisting of two glycosyltransferase GT-A domains that are consistent with possessing Sn2-type GalNAc and GlcA transfer reactions at the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The N- and C-terminal domains orient their open access sites for donor substrates in directions perpendicular to one another, and their active sites do not share the same space within the K4CP molecule. What this x-ray crystal structure revealed posed a critical question with regard to the mechanism by which K4CP catalyzes the polymerization reaction; is this a random reaction? If it is not, then how does K4CP coordinate these two active sites, which are not in the same space and are positioned perpendicularly, to propel the polymerization reaction? Conversely, the K4CP structure also revealed the intriguing structural feature of a peptide consisting of residues 58–134 that wraps around the C-terminal domain before extending back into the N-terminal domain. Here we focus on this N-terminal peptide and examine its role in the polymerization reaction as catalyzed by K4CP. Recombinant K4CPΔ57 and its mutants were subjected to assays to determine enzyme activity and to isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 2The abbreviations used are: ITCisothermal titration calorimetryCHchondroitin linear saccharide chain consisting of repeating disaccharide units (GlcUA-GalNAc)nCH6chondroitin hexasaccharide (GlcUA-GalNAc)3CH7chondroitin hepatasaccharide GalNAc-(GlcUA-GalNAc)3Bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. analyses to characterize donor and acceptor substrate binding. Interaction between the 113DWPSDL118sequence within the N-terminal peptide with the peptide 677YTWKI682 in the C-terminal region of the K4CP molecule was characterized as the regulatory motif that determines each of the two transfer reactions as well as coordinates the polymerization reaction. We have now generated K4CP mutants that represent different states of the polymerization reaction. These states are consistent with the hypothesis that interaction between specific N- and C-terminal peptides supports an underlying mechanism that coordinates the transfer reaction to induce polymerization. isothermal titration calorimetry chondroitin linear saccharide chain consisting of repeating disaccharide units (GlcUA-GalNAc)n chondroitin hexasaccharide (GlcUA-GalNAc)3 chondroitin hepatasaccharide GalNAc-(GlcUA-GalNAc)3 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Thrombin and trypsin were purchased from Sigma. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and C41 (DE3) cells were produced by Agilent Technologies (Cary, NC) and Lucigen (Middleton, WI), respectively. pGEX plasmid was obtained from GE Healthcare. Primers were generated by Invitrogen. HEPES was procured from Sigma. CH polymer (a chemically desulfated derivative of CS-C from shark cartilage) was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalNAc, testicular hyaluronidase, and β-glucuronidase were purchased from Sigma. Ni-NTATM-agarose and anti-tetra His antibody came from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The SuperdexTM Peptide HR10/30 column, SuperdexTM 30 HiLoad 16/60 column, Q-Sepharose ion exchange resin, sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads, and the ECL detection system were from GE Healthcare. A semiquantitative SAX MAGNAM ion exchange column was purchased from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). CH oligosaccharides were prepared from CH polymer as previously described (11Sugiura N. Shimokata S. Minamisawa T. Hirabayashi J. Kimata K. Watanabe H. Sequential synthesis of chondroitin oligosaccharides by immobilized chondroitin polymerase mutants.Glycoconj. J. 2008; 25: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the preparation of even-numbered oligosaccharides such as CH6, CH polymer was digested with testicular hyaluronidase. For the preparation of odd-numbered oligosaccharides such as CH7, the hyaluronidase digests were further treated with β-glucuronidase at 37 °C. CH6 and CH7 were separated from these digests by chromatography on a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column and a Superdex 30 gel filtration column. The structures of the oligosaccharides were confirmed with MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry (MS) spectrometer (AutoFlex, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocols described in the accompanying instruction manual utilizing proper primers. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing with the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with a given pGEX plasmid in SOC medium, (Invitrogen) and the transformed cells were selected from a Luria-Bertani agar plate containing a 100 μg/ml concentration of ampicillin. Transformed cells grown in Luria-Bertani medium were inoculated into 2YT media containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. When A600 of the culture reached 0.6, the temperature was set to 23.5 °C, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 0.2 mm) was added 14 h before cells were harvested. Purification of protein and confirmation of protein purity was performed as previously reported (12Sobhany M. Kakuta Y. Sugiura N. Kimata K. Negishi M. The chondroitin polymerase K4CP and the molecular mechanism of selective bindings of donor substrates to two active sites.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32328-32333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out in HEPES buffer using an iTC200 MicroCalorimeter (GE Healthcare) at 20 °C. Substrate solutions containing UDP, UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-GalNAc, C6, and C7 at 4 mm or UDP-GlcA at 1 mm were injected into a reaction cell containing ∼100–200 μm protein. Thirty injections of 7 μl at 120 s intervals were performed. Data acquisition and analysis were performed by the MicroCal Origin software package. Data analysis was performed by generating a binding isotherm and best fit using the following fitting parameters: N (number of sites), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/deg), and K (binding constant in M−1) and the standard Levenberg-Marquardt methods (13Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989Google Scholar). After data analysis, K (m−1) was then converted to Kd (μm). One microgram of protein in HEPES buffer was incubated with 50, 5, or 0.5 ng of trypsin for 30 min at room temperature. Digestion was halted by adding 1 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Active Motif) and then boiling for 1 min. Samples were then loaded onto a NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) with 6 μl of NuPage 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and subjected to electrophoresis. Gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G 250 (Fluka). Two major bands stained with the Colloidal Blue Staining kit (Invitrogen) were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Gel bands were excised manually and digested with trypsin (Promega) for 8 h in an automated fashion with a Progest In-gel Digester from Genomics Solutions. Samples were lyophilized to dryness and resuspended in 50:50 (v/v) 0.2% formic acid:acetonitrile. Samples (0.3 μl) were then spotted onto a 192-sample stainless steel MALDI plate and mixed on target with 0.3 μl of 33% saturated α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid. MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were then performed with the use of an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer in the positive ion and reflector modes, respectively. The MS was calibrated internally using autolytic tryptic peptides, and the MS/MS was calibrated externally using the fragment ions of the angiotensin I (M+H)+ ion (m/z 1296.68). A focus mass of m/z 2000 was used for the MS acquisition. For the MS/MS, 1000 V was used for the collision energy, and argon was used as the collision gas with a recharge threshold set at 1.0 × 10−7 torr. Protein identification was then performed by interrogating both MS and MS/MS using the MASCOT search engine and the entire NCBI non-redundant database. Search parameters included an allowance of two missed tryptic cleavages, a 0.06-Da mass tolerance for the MS data, a 0.1-Da mass tolerance for the MS/MS data, and an allowance for variable oxidation of methionine residues. GalNAc transfer, GlcA transfer, and chondroitin polymerase activities of the recombinant enzymes were measured using radioisotope donor substrates as described previously (13Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989Google Scholar) with a slight modification; for the GalNAc transfer activity assay, a 50-μl mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 20 mm MnCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, UDP-[3H]GalNAc (3 nmol, 0.1 μCi) as the donor substrate and 1 nmol of chondroitin hexasaccharide as the acceptor substrate was incubated with the recombinant enzymes (2.0 μg) at 30 °C for 60 min and then heated in boiling water. For the GlcA transfer activity assay, UDP-[14C]GlcA (3 nmol, 0.1 μCi) and 1 nmol of chondroitin pentasaccharide were used as the donor and acceptor substrates, respectively. For the polymerase activity assay, UDP-[3H]GalNAc (3 nmol, 0.1 μCi) and UDP-GlcA (3 nmol) were used as the donor substrates, and 0.1 nmol of chondroitin pentasaccharide was used as the acceptor substrate. The radiolabeled saccharides were separated by a Superdex Peptide column and measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The enzyme activities were determined by calculating the amount of the incorporated radioactive sugars. The N-terminal peptide (residues 58–134), which wraps around the C-terminal domain of K4CPΔ57 in the x-ray crystal, comprises a linear structure that contains a random coil and three α-helices (see supplemental Fig. 1A for locations). This peptide was successively deleted to produce mutants K4CPΔ95, K4CPΔ101, K4CPΔ107, and K4CPΔ113 (Fig. 1). Subsequently, ITC was employed using these deletion mutants to determine their bindings to the donor substrates UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA. The K4CPΔ95 mutant, which removed the first two α-helices, retained similar Kd values for binding to UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA to those observed with K4CPΔ57 (Table 1). Therefore, K4CPΔ95 was further deleted by six amino acid residues at a time to produce K4CPΔ101, K4CPΔ107, and K4CPΔ113 (Fig. 1). The K4CPΔ101 mutant exhibited Kd values for binding to UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc similar to those of K4CPΔ57 and K4CPΔ95 (Table 1). Mutant K4CPΔ107 maintained a Kd value for UDP-GlcA binding similar to that of the K4CPΔ95 mutant while exhibiting a significant decrease in that of UDP-GalNAc binding. With its further deletions, K4CPΔ113 lost binding to UDP-GalNAc while retaining UDP-GlcA binding. The donor substrate product UDP bound to K4CPΔ95 but not to K4CPΔ107 or K4CPΔ113 (Table 1).TABLE 1Donor substrate binding of N-terminal truncated K4CP enzymesEnzymeUDP-GalNAcUDP-GlcAUDPΔSKdnΔSKdsnΔSKdncal/mol/degreeμmcal/mol/degreeμmcal/mol/degreeμmK4CPΔ57−22.61358.17 ± 26.641.25 ± 0.32−5.292.75 ± 0.191.00 ± 0.03−10.9689.53 ± 22.770.91 ± 0.09K4CPΔ95−1.84494.56 ± 26.241.14 ± 0.33−16.702.99 ± 0.061.02 ± 0.05−18.70143.88 ± 35.650.94 ± 0.14K4CPΔ101−6.20429.18 ± 77.660.94 ± 0.04−16.305.92 ± 1.310.89 ± 0.1110.8089.29 ± 14.550.92 ± 0.12K4CPΔ1070.2961.73 ± 20.610.81 ± 0.062.348.55 ± 3.270.96 ± 0.15NDNDNDK4CPΔ113NDNDND17.803.45 ± 1.650.90 ± 0.04NDNDND Open table in a new tab Given these donor substrate interactions, the K4CP deletion mutants were then subjected to enzyme assays to determine GalNAc and GlcA transfer and polymerase activities (Table 2). K4CPΔ95 and K4CPΔ101 catalyzed these three activities as effectively as K4CPΔ57. K4CPΔ107 abrogated polymerase activity while fully retaining both GalNAc and GlcA transfer activities. K4CPΔ113 retained levels of UDP-GalNAc transfer activity that were decreased by 50% while virtually abrogating UDP-GlcA transfer activity; as expected, K4CPΔ113 did not catalyze the polymerization reaction. Thus, the deletions of the N-terminal peptide resulted in generating K4CP mutants with diverse enzymatic features. Among them, K4CPΔ107 provided the most critical insight into the nature of K4CP; K4CP needs to coordinate its two transfer activities to catalyze the polymerase reaction and residues 101–113 are critical for this coordination to occur.TABLE 2GalNAc and GlcA transfer and polymerase activitiesEnzymeGalNAc-TGlcA-TPolymerasepmol/min/μg%pmol/min/μg%pmol/min/μg%K4CPΔ571.54 ± 0.27100.06.12 ± 0.76100.00.527 ± 0.031100.0K4CPΔ951.56 ± 0.30101.05.62 ± 0.3992.80.453 ± 0.07185.9K4CPΔ1011.54 ± 0.2799.96.00 ± 0.6797.90.515 ± 0.06697.7K4CPΔ1071.27 ± 0.1082.35.43 ± 0.2887.20.095 ± 0.03318.1K4CPΔ1130.84 ± 0.0954.80.48 ± 0.018.00.007 ± 0.0021.4 Open table in a new tab Our previous ITC analysis of donor substrate binding demonstrated that UDP-GalNAc does not bind to the N-terminal active site where GalNAc transfer occurs unless the C-terminal binding motif DSD is inactivated by mutation to ASA (12Sobhany M.

Therefore, the mutant constructs K4CPΔ101 ASA, K4CPΔ107 ASA, and K4CPΔ113 ASA were generated to examine UDP-GalNAc binding to their N-terminal active sites. ITC analysis on these ASA mutants confirmed that all of these ASA mutants bind UDP-GalNAc to their N-terminal active sites (Table 3), supporting the fact that K4CPΔ101, K4CPΔ107, and K4CPΔ113 catalyzed GalNAc transfer activity (Table 1). Noticeably, these ASA mutants exhibited Kd values that were 6–20-fold lower for UDP binding as compared with those for UDP-GalNAc binding. However, these higher UDP bindings did not prevent them from catalyzing GalNAc transfer at the N-terminal active site.TABLE 3UDP and UDP-GalNAc binding to the N-terminal active site of truncated K4CP enzymes utilizing their ASA mutantEnzymeUDPUDP-GalNAcΔSKdnΔSKdncal/mol/degreeμmcal/mol/degreeμmK4CPΔ101 ASA−0.0420.44 ± 7.261.06 ± 0.05−5.93362.32 ± 46.061.00 ± 0.09K4CPΔ107 ASA3.5318.97 ± 6.520.89 ± 0.1312.30103.89 ± 7.951.27 ± 0.14K4CPΔ113 ASA18.901.48 ± 0.740.89 ± 0.0218.8022.52 ± 7.251.15 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab Given that K4CPΔ107 altered enzymatic activity, a partial proteolysis experiment was employed to test the hypothesis that deletion of residues 58–107 affected the K4CP structure in such a manner that resulted in altered enzyme activity. Peptide fragments, which were generated from digested K4CPΔ57 and K4CPΔ107, were then separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to mass spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. 2). A peptide fragment consisting of nine amino acids found in the C terminus beginning with Tyr-677 and ending with Leu-686 was uniquely generated from the K4CPΔ107 protein (supplemental Table 3). Analysis of the x-ray structure of K4CPΔ57 revealed that the peptide 677YTWEKI682 within this fragment forms an interface with the N-terminal peptide 113DWPSDL118 in the K4CP molecule: Tyr-677, Trp-679, and Lys-681 form hydrogen bonds with Asp-113, Pro-115, Asp-117, and Leu-118 within 113DWPSDL118. This 113DWPSDL118 peptide appeared to be involved in determining K4CP enzyme activity. The determining role of the interaction between 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682 was further investigated by internally deleting these peptides from K4CPΔ57. K4CPΔDWPSDL was capable of binding to both UDP-GlcA and UDP-GalNAc (Table 4). Despite binding to UDP-GlcA, K4CPΔDWPSDL nearly abrogated all GlcA transfer and polymerase activities (Table 5). K4CPΔDWPSDL ASA confirmed that K4CPΔDWPSDL retained GalNAc transfer activity at the N-terminal active site, although ITC analysis did not detect UDP-GalNAc binding to this deletion mutant. As expected, K4CPΔDWPSDL ASA completely eliminated the ∼1% residual GlcA transfer activity that remained in the K4CPΔDWPSDL mutant. UDP did not bind to either K4CPΔDWPSDL or K4CPΔDWPSDL ASA. Similar to K4CPΔDWPSDL, K4CPΔYTWEKI, which internally deleted 677YTWEKI682, bound to both UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcA and retained GalNAc transfer activity; however, GlcA transfer and polymerase activities were completely abrogated (TABLE 4, TABLE 5). Thus, K4CPΔDWPSDL and K4CPΔYTWEKI decoupled UDP-GlcA binding from GlcA transfer activity in K4CPΔ57. In an alternate to internal deletions, Tyr-677, Trp-679, and Lys-681 within 677YTWEKI682 were simultaneously substituted with Asp, Ala, and Asp, respectively, to disrupt the interactions between these two peptides. The triple mutants K4CP YWKpm and K4CP YWKpm ASA abolished all function of K4CP, and no donor substrate binding and no enzyme activities were detected (TABLE 4, TABLE 5). On the other hand, both K4CP YWKpm and K4CP YWKpm ASA bound UDP at Kd values of around 1 μm at both N- and C-terminal active sites (Table 4).TABLE 4Regulation of enzyme functions by the interaction between 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682EnzymeUDP-GalNAcUDP-GlcAUDPΔSKdnΔSKdnΔSKdncal/mol/degreeμmcal/mol/degreeμmcal/mol/degreeμmK4CPΔDWPSDL14.90101.42 ± 26.461.11 ± 0.1122.800.96 ± 0.351.36 ± 0.19NDNDNDK4CPΔDWPSDL ASANDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDK4CPΔYTWEKI6.5319.72 ± 7.141.17 ± 0.14−15.603.52 ± 0.980.97 ± 0.0315.1014.77 ± 5.090.71 ± 0.12K4CP YWKpmNDNDNDNDNDND19.700.91 ± 0.341.31 ± 0.05K4CP YWKpm ASANDNDNDNDNDND22.601.21 ± 0.141.00 ± 0.13 Open table in a new tab TABLE 5Regulation of enzyme functions by the interaction between 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682EnzymeGalNAc-TGlcA-TPolymerasepmol/min/μg%pmol/min/μg%pmol/min/μg%K4CPΔDWPSDL1.00 ± 0.1665.00.06 ± 0.011.00.01 ± 0.001.1K4CPΔDWPSDL ASA1.02 ± 0.1665.60.00 ± 0.000.00.00 ± 0.000.0K4CPΔYTWEKI1.49 ± 0.02100.00.08 ± 0.011.50.00 ± 0.000.0K4CP YWKpm0.00 ± 0.000.00.00 ± 0.000.00.00 ± 0.000.0 Open table in a new tab ITC analysis for acceptor substrates with K4CPΔ57, K4CPΔ57 ASA, and K4CPΔ57 ACA determined that CH6 (GlcA at the non-reducing end) and CH7 (GalNAc at the non-reducing end) bind to the N- and C-terminal active sites, respectively (Table 4). Acceptor bindings remain constant in K4CPΔ107, which abrogates polymerase activity while retaining transfer activities. In addition, the binding of CH6 to K4CPΔ57 ASA, but not to the K4CPΔ57, indicates that CH6 binding to the N-terminal active site is regulated by the C-terminal active site. On the other hand, CH7 binding to the C-terminal active site is not controlled by the N-terminal active site. The characteristics of these acceptor bindings are reminiscent of the donor substrates. Although K4CP YWKpm ASA neither binds to UDP-GalNAc nor catalyzes GalNAc transfer activity, this mutant retains binding to donor substrate CH6 (Table 6). Likewise, CH7 binding is retained by K4CPΔYTWEKI (Table 7), which does bind to the donor substrate UDP-GlcA but does not catalyze GlcA transfer activity. Thus, K4CPΔYTWEKI appears to alter the substrate binding conformation so that this mutant loses transfer activity.TABLE 6C6 acceptor substrate binding to the N-terminal active site of truncated K4CP enzymes utilizing their ASA mutantsEnzymeC6 acceptor substrateΔSKdncal/mol/degreeμmK4CPΔ57NDNDNDK4CPΔ57 ASA28.400.25 ± 0.010.86 ± 0.06K4CPΔ107NDNDNDK4CPΔ107 ASA10.808.78 ± 0.880.92 ± 0.05K4CP YWKpmNDNDNDK4CP YWKpm ASA12.908.47 ± 3.431.23 ± 0.21 Open table in a new tab TABLE 7C7 acceptor substrate binding to the C-terminal active site of K4CP enzymesEnzymeC7 acceptor substrateΔSKd (μm)ncal/mol/degreeK4CPΔ5716.3029.59 ± 7.121.00 ± 0.09K4CPΔ57 ACA8.4535.71 ± 4.311.47 ± 0.08K4CPΔ10715.8071.94 ± 6.191.11 ± 0.09K4CPΔYTWEKI12.8059.88 ± 11.411.36 ± 0.18 Open table in a new tab The bifunctional glycosyltransferase chondroitin synthase K4CP alternatively transfers GalNAc and GlcA at the N- and C-terminal active sites, respectively, to polymerize them into the chondroitin chain. A characteristic of this polymerization reaction is the fact that there is no template to assist K4CP with the reaction, as compared with the polymerization reactions catalyzed by DNA and RNA polymerases and peptide synthesis. Our study utilized K4CP mutants and defined the different states that occur during the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the peptide interaction between 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682 has been characterized as an essential factor that determines transfer activities and enables the polymerization reaction. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that K4CP possess an intrinsic mechanism within itself to coordinate the two transfer reactions, enabling K4CP to extend the chondroitin chain. Based on enzyme activities, K4CPΔ57 mutants can be organized into three different groups that possess structural features that could represent distinct stages of the enzyme reaction: I, II, and III (Fig. 2A). Stage I enzyme possesses both GlcA and GalNAc transfer activities but no polymerase activity; stage II possesses GalNAc transfer activity but no GlcA transfer or polymerase activities; stage III comprises an inert enzyme with no transfer or polymerase activities. Based on these stages the reaction cycle of the proposed polymerization cycle is depicted in Fig. 2B. In rejecting the notion that polymerization is a random reaction, the first compelling evidence in support of the concept of a coordinated reaction mechanism came when K4CPΔ107 was found to fully retain both donor and acceptor substrate binding as well as transfer activities, but polymerization activity was abolished (stage I). K4CPΔ107 does not remove 113DWPSDL118 but still appears to destabilize the interaction of this signature peptide with 677YTWEKI682 as indicated by our present partial proteolysis of this deletion mutant and mass spectroscopic identification of the digested peptide. Therefore, acting as an interdomain mechanism, this instability causes a structural disconnect between the two glycosyltransfer activities, disabling the enzyme ability to coordinate these activities and elongate the chondroitin chain. In support of the concept that the peptides 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682 are essential for the polymerization reaction to occur, the deletion of either 113DWPSDL118 (K4CPΔDWPSDL) or 677YTWEKI682 (K4CPΔYTWEKI) abolished the enzyme ability to catalyze polymerization. However, unlike K4CPΔ107, which retained both GalNAc and GlcA transfer activities, K4CPΔDWPSDL and K4CPΔYTWEKI lost GlcA transfer activity while retaining GalNAc transfer activity, thereby suggesting that deletion of one of these two peptides abolishes GlcA, but not GalNAc, transfer activity, which may represent a distinct step during polymerization reaction (stage II). K4CPΔDWPSDL ASA in fact confirmed that the GalNAc transfer activity is retained in K4CPΔDWPSDL where it could be catalyzed at the N-terminal active site. Although it remains a question as to why ITC analysis did not detect UDP-GalNAc binding to the N-terminal active site (Table 4), this donor binding could have occurred in a manner that did not allow for detection by ITC. Despite possessing binding ability to both UDP-GlcA and C7 substrates at the C-terminal active site, K4CPΔYTWEKI was unable to catalyze GlcA transfer activity (stage II). Noticeably, K4CPΔYTWEKI strengthened its UDP binding affinity (Kd values 6-fold lower than those observed with K4CPΔ57) to be equivalent to UDP-GlcA binding constant at the C terminus. These changes in UDP binding indicate that the deletion mutants alter a portion of the active site structure to where the UDP moiety of UDP-sugar molecule binds; this alteration may have repressed GlcA transfer activity in K4CPΔYTWEKI. A simultaneous triple mutation of the peptide YTWEKI (K4CP YWKpm) appears to alter K4CP structure differently from complete deletion of the peptide (K4CPΔYTWEKI). K4CP YWKpm and K4CP YWKpm ASA have provided experimental evidence indicating that K4CP can adopt structural features that force the enzyme to be totally free from donor substrate binding as well as catalytic activities while retaining CH6 and CH7 acceptor substrate binding to their respective sites (stage III). Because K4CP YWKpm ASA retains C6 acceptor substrate binding, the acceptor substrate cannot be the direct cause of repression of transfer activity. It is intriguing that we did not encounter a K4CP mutant that represses GalNAc transfer at the N-terminal active site while proceeding with GlcA transfer activity at the C-terminal active site, which should exist during the polymerization reaction. K4CP YWKpm and K4CP YWKpm ASA exhibit high affinity UDP binding (Kd values around 1 μm) to each active site, possibly resetting K4CP for the next round of the catalytic cycle to elongate the chondroitin chain. Because the binding affinity of UDP-GlcA at the C-terminal active site in K4CPΔ57, but not UDP-GalNAc, is equivalent to the UDP binding in K4CP YWKpm, stage III may represent an enzymatic state that precedes a subsequent structural alteration allowing UDP-GlcA binding to initiate the new-round of the reaction. Therefore, these structural features may enable K4CP to coordinate transfer reactions to elongate the chondroitin chain. The possibility of these structural features being conserved in other bi-functional glycosyltransferases is intriguing. Given that K4CP is the only such transferase whose structure has been solved, future investigations will have to determine whether other bifunctional glycosyltransferases possess peptides that interact in a manner similar to that of 113DWPSDL118 and 677YTWEKI682 and the role this interaction in elongating carbohydrate chains. In conclusion, these K4CP mutants exhibit at least three different states of the polymerization reaction that can be integrated into a hypothetical scheme for the overall reaction cycle used by K4CP to elongate chondroitin chains (Fig. 2). Because acceptor substrates remain bound to their respective active sites, donor substrate binding appears to be the determinant for K4CP's ability to coordinate the two transfer activities and polymerize chondroitin chains. The reaction may start by UDP-GlcA binding to the C-terminal active site of Stage III, transferring GlcA to the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide. Then the produced oligosaccharide moves into the N-terminal active site of Stage II by virtue of the regulation imposed by the C-terminal active site and GalNAc transfer follows. Then the second transferred product may move back to the C-terminal active site. K4CP is endowed with an intrinsic molecular mechanism that may utilize the interaction of the N-terminal 113DWPSDL118 with the 677YTWEKI682 peptide of the C-terminal domain to coordinate GalNAc and GlcA transfers and elongate the chondroitin chain. In this scheme, understanding the structural basis for why K4CP mutants possess both transfer activities but not polymerase activity will be most critical for us to determine the molecular mechanism of the polymerization reaction. With this in mind, solving the structural features that connects the 113DWPSDL118 peptide with the C-terminal domain, an area for which no electron density was detected in the current K4CP structure, may be critical to unifying these observed snapshots at stages during the polymerization process to fully decipher the molecular-based regulatory machinery that confers K4CP the ability to coordinate its polymerization reaction.

https://openalex.org/W1995384670,"A distinct three-dimensional shape of rRNA inside the ribosome is required for the peptidyl transfer activity of its peptidyltransferase center (PTC). In contrast, even the in vitro transcribed PTC RNA interacts with unfolded protein(s) at about five sites to let them attain their native states. We found that the same set of conserved nucleotides in the PTC interact identically with nascent and chemically unfolded proteins in vivo and in vitro, respectively. The time course of this interaction, difficult to follow in vivo, was observed in vitro. It suggested nucleation of folding of cytosolic globular proteins vectorially from hydrophilic N to hydrophobic C termini, consistent with our discovery of a regular arrangement of cumulative hydrophobic indices of the peptide segments of cytosolic proteins from N to C termini. Based on this observation, we propose a model here for the nucleation of folding of the nascent protein chain by the PTC."

Islet amyloid also contains heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that may contribute to amyloid formation by binding IAPP via their heparan sulfate (HS) chains. We hypothesized that β-cells produce HS that bind IAPP via regions of highly sulfated disaccharides. Unexpectedly, HS from the β-cell line β-TC3 contained fewer regions of highly sulfated disaccharides compared with control normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells. The proportion of HS that bound IAPP was similar in both cell lines (∼65%). The sulfation pattern of IAPP-bound versus non-bound HS from β-TC3 cells was similar. In contrast, IAPP-bound HS from NMuMG cells contained frequent highly sulfated regions, whereas the non-bound material demonstrated fewer sulfated regions. Fibril formation from IAPP was stimulated equally by IAPP-bound β-TC3 HS, non-bound β-TC3 HS, and non-bound NMuMG HS but was stimulated to a greater extent by the highly sulfated IAPP-bound NMuMG HS. Desulfation of HS decreased the ability of both β-TC3 and NMuMG HS to stimulate IAPP maximal fibril formation, but desulfated HS from both cell types still accelerated fibril formation relative to IAPP alone. In summary, neither binding to nor acceleration of fibril formation from the amyloidogenic peptide IAPP is dependent on overall sulfation in HS synthesized by β-TC3 cells. This information will be important in determining approaches to reduce HS-IAPP interactions and ultimately prevent islet amyloid formation and its toxic effects in type 2 diabetes.

We and others have shown that HSPGs are capable of binding the amyloidogenic peptide IAPP (11Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D.

Upon binding amyloidogenic peptides, HSPGs or their oligosaccharide heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains have been shown to induce structural changes in the peptide to the β-sheet structure required for amyloid fibril formation (16McCubbin W.D.

Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2452-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that HSPGs are important for amyloid formation. Heparan sulfate undergoes a complex set of modifications following its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Many of these modifications are sulfation reactions, catalyzed by a diverse array of enzymes including N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase and 2-, 3-, or 6-O-sulfotransferases (17Esko J.D. Lindahl U. Molecular diversity of heparan sulfate.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). These modifications typically result in the formation of domains containing either non-sulfated (acetylated) or highly sulfated oligosaccharides, with the size, arrangement, and composition of these sulfated domains determining the ability of HS to bind a diverse set of protein ligands (18Kreuger J. Spillmann D. Li J.P. Lindahl U. Interactions between heparan sulfate and proteins: the concept of specificity.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The composition of HS attached to a given core protein has been shown to vary widely among tissue types, suggesting a complex level of tissue specificity in HS synthesis and modification (17Esko J.D. Lindahl U. Molecular diversity of heparan sulfate.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). For example, HS composition, particularly sulfation, of perlecan (19Knox S. Merry C. Stringer S. Melrose J. Whitelock J. Not all perlecans are created equal: interactions with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and FGF receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14657-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and syndecan (20Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can differ among cell types, and this has been implicated in altered affinity for the perlecan ligand fibroblast growth factor 2 and fibroblast growth factor receptors (19Knox S. Merry C. Stringer S. Melrose J. Whitelock J. Not all perlecans are created equal: interactions with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 and FGF receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14657-14665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Islet amyloid is a form of localized amyloidosis, with its deposition occurring in close proximity to the islet β-cell, the source of the amyloidogenic peptide IAPP. We previously showed that the immortalized murine pancreatic islet β-cell line β-TC3 synthesizes and secretes several proteoglycans, predominantly HSPGs (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Hull R.L. Zraika S. Udayasankar J. Kisilevsky R. Szarek W.A. Wight T.N. Kahn S.E. Inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis and protein glycosylation with WAS-406 and azaserine result in reduced islet amyloid formation in vitro.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C1586-C1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that these β-TC3 cell proteoglycans are capable of binding amyloidogenic human IAPP (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that these locally produced proteoglycans may be important in IAPP fibril formation and the deposition of islet amyloid in type 2 diabetes. We therefore hypothesized that the degree of sulfation of β-TC3 cell HS is an important determinant of IAPP binding and thereby IAPP fibril formation. Here, we report the composition, IAPP-binding, and fibril-enhancing ability of HS synthesized by β-TC3 cells. The murine insulinoma cell line, β-TC3 (passage 55–57), was utilized for this study, with normal murine mammary gland epithelial (NMuMG, passage 4–7) cells as a control cell line. The latter were obtained from ATCC. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per ml and cultured for up to 4 days in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5.5 mm or 25 mm glucose for β-TC3 or NMuMG cells, respectively, followed by metabolic labeling for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 16.7 or 25 mm glucose. 5.5 mm glucose was selected for the 4-day culture of β-TC3 cells to avoid glucotoxic effects of long term culture that have been well documented in islets/β-cells. For IAPP affinity column and solid-phase binding studies with intact proteoglycans, β-TC3 cells were labeled for 48 h with 50 or 5 μCi/ml Na2[35S]SO4, respectively. For HS composition and binding studies, β-TC3 and NMuMG cells were labeled for 48 h with 40 μCi/ml [3H]D-glucosamine HCl plus 100 μCi/ml Na2[35S]SO4 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). For disaccharide analysis and fibril formation studies, cultures were not radiolabeled but were otherwise treated similarly to labeled cultures. Culture medium was collected in the presence of protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine, 100 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and proteoglycans were extracted by ion exchange chromatography using DEAE Sephacel in 8 m urea buffer (8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) and eluted with 4 m guanidine buffer (4 m guanidine HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm Na2SO4, 100 mm Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100 detergent, pH 7.4). Samples were either used as total proteoglycan or subjected to size fractionation via Sepharose CL-4B to yield three pools of proteoglycans based on size (denoted M1, M2, and M3, described in detail in Ref. 12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cell layers were extracted in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and pooled with conditioned medium. Samples were then treated with Pronase (0.1 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.2; Sigma) for 16 h at 37 °C to digest core proteins and then subjected to DEAE ion exchange chromatography with the DEAE equilibrated in PBS containing 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, and samples eluted in PBS containing 3 m NaCl. Glycosaminoglycans were liberated from residual core protein fragments by alkaline elimination and borohydride reduction; samples were treated with 1 m NaBH4 in 0.025 m NaOH for 24 h at 45 °C, followed by neutralization with acetic acid. Samples were then desalted by precipitation (three times) in 95% ethanol/1.3% CH3CO2K followed by resuspension in deionized water. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans were removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC (0.5 units/ml, Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan; 16 h at 37 °C). Samples were then dialyzed over 24–48 h against at least four changes of deionized water, and the presence of HS/lack of contaminating chondroitin or dermatan sulfate in the sample was verified by size exclusion chromatography ± heparinase I, II, and III digestion. Human IAPP (200 μg; Bachem, Torrance, CA) was covalently linked to AminoLink Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human IAPP was used for this and subsequent experiments as this form of IAPP is amyloidogenic, whereas mouse and rat IAPP are not (22Westermark P. Engström U. Johnson K.H. Westermark G.T. Betsholtz C. Islet amyloid polypeptide: pinpointing amino acid residues linked to amyloid fibril formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 5036-5040Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that β-TC3 proteoglycans bind human but not rodent IAPP (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to the IAPP affinity column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline, TBS). For intact [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycans, 200,000 dpm were loaded, eluted over a 0.15–3 m NaCl gradient in TBS, and finally washed in 8 m urea buffer containing 3 m NaCl. For double-labeled HS samples 100,000 dpm (based on 3H incorporation to yield equal quantities of HS) were loaded, the column washed in TBS containing 0.15 m NaCl and bound material eluted in TBS containing 3 m NaCl, followed by a final wash in 8 m urea buffer containing 3 m NaCl. Eluted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (for intact proteoglycans; 20,000 dpm per lane was loaded) or was subjected to heparinase I or heparinase III enzyme digestion (for HS samples; see details below) followed by Bio-gel P10 size exclusion chromatography. β-TC3 proteoglycans were subjected to Sepharose CL-4B size exclusion chromatography and subdivided into three fractions based on molecular weight. IAPP binding of proteoglycans by solid phase assay was assessed in fractions M1 and M2 only, as these fractions but not M3 were shown to bind amyloidogenic human IAPP by affinity chromatography. Proteoglycans were concentrated by precipitation in 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate, reconstituted in transfer buffer (12.5 mm Tris, 96 mm glycine, 10% (v/v) methanol), and 2,000 dpm per sample was applied to a prewet nitrocellulose membrane via a Bio-Dot microfiltration system (Bio-Rad). Heparan sulfate or chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans were selectively removed from the immobilized proteoglycans by heparinase digestion (2.6 units/ml heparinase I, 1.3 units/ml heparinase II + 2.6 units/ml heparinase III, Sigma) or chondroitin ABC lyase digestion (0.1 units/ml), respectively, for 2 h at 37 °C. Control (undigested) samples were incubated in the absence of enzyme and negative (no proteoglycan) controls consisted of digestion buffer (0.1 m Tris, 10 mm calcium acetate, 18 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0) alone. Following digestion, proteoglycans were incubated with 4% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in TBS (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 3 h at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with human IAPP (10 μg/ml in TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Bound IAPP was detected using the monoclonal anti-IAPP antibody F055 (kind gift from Amylin Corp., San Diego, CA; 1:100,000) and visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins and enhanced chemiluminescence. Presence of residual proteoglycans on the nitrocellulose membrane following heparinase digestion was achieved using the heparan sulfate stubs antibody 3G10 (Seikagaku; 1:1000) and visualized as for anti-IAPP antibody. Heparan sulfate from β-TC3 and NMuMG were analyzed in total HS preparations and in IAPP-bound and non-bound fractions following human IAPP affinity chromatography. Samples (10,000 dpm) were subjected to no treatment (intact HS), low pH (1.5) nitrous acid treatment (23Lindahl U. Bäckström G. Jansson L. Hallén A. Biosynthesis of heparin. II. Formation of sulfamino groups.J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7234-7241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and heparinase I or heparinase III digestion to assess the proportion of N-sulfated highly sulfated or poorly sulfated heparan sulfate disaccharides, respectively (2.6 units/ml for each enzyme, digested for 2 h at 37 °C). Reaction products were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-gel P10 column equilibrated in 0.5 m NH4HCO3 and/or Sepharose CL-6B equilibrated in TBS, pH 7.0, and the content of [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate-labeled HS per fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Undigested HS elutes in the void volume (V0) of the Bio-gel P10 column (24Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Structural characterization of heparan sulfate proteoglycan subclasses isolated from bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2136-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (data not shown) and elutes in the included volume of the Sepharose CL-6B column (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Non-radiolabeled HS was quantified by 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay, with glycosaminoglycans of known concentration as standards (25Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Improved quantitation and discrimination of sulphated glycosaminoglycans by use of dimethylmethylene blue.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2897) Google Scholar). Analysis of heparan sulfate disaccharide abundance was performed by the Glycotechnology Core Resource at the University of California, San Diego. The limit of detection for heparan sulfate disaccharides is 0.5 pmol/liter. Pyridine salts of HS samples (10 μg for each) were generated by ion exchange on Dowex 50 (H+) under acidic conditions followed by neutralization with pyridine. These samples were then incubated in 10% (v/v) methanol in dimethyl sulfoxide for 18 h at 80 °C, adjusted to pH 9 with NaOH, dialyzed against several changes of deionized water and lyophilized (26Nagasawa K.

For these studies, IAPP was obtained commercially (Bachem) or was kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Raleigh (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). IAPP fibril formation alone and in the presence of HS samples did not differ by source of IAPP. For the end point fibril formation assay, HS samples (12.5 μl in duplicate) in water were added to an equal volume of synthetic human IAPP peptide to give final concentrations of 25 μg/ml for HS and 100 μg/ml (25 μm) IAPP, yielding a 1:4 (wt/wt) HS:IAPP ratio. For the kinetic fibril formation assay, this HS:IAPP ratio was titrated to ensure good resolution of lag phases and maximal fibril formation within the 132-h time frame of the assay; a 1:32 HS:IAPP ratio was used for these studies. IAPP stock solution (1.6 mm) was filtered (0.2 μm), lyophilized, and reconstituted (final concentration 48 μg/ml) immediately prior to use to ensure no aggregates were present at base line. Sulfated or desulfated HS samples used at a final concentration of 1.5 μg/ml. For both studies, control samples were IAPP alone (positive control for fibril formation) and HS samples with no IAPP (negative controls). Thioflavin T (4 μm) was added to samples, and fibril formation assessed by fluorescence at 480 nm/530 nm. For the end point assay, fibril formation was assessed over a period of 6 h, and data are reported after 30 min, which is representative of the whole time course. For the kinetics assay, data were collected every 10 min over 132 h, and data are shown for the whole period. Data shown are representative for the following sample sizes. For intact proteoglycan studies, IAPP affinity chromatography was performed twice, and solid phase binding assay was performed at least three times on two independent proteoglycan preparations. For HS analyses, IAPP affinity columns for radiolabeled samples were performed on three independent preparations; radiolabeled composition studies (total and after IAPP column) were performed on the same preparations, with each analysis being performed at least twice. Disaccharide analysis was performed on two independent HS samples. IAPP affinity columns for non-radiolabeled HS samples were performed on two independent preparations, one of which was used for disaccharide analysis, and both of which were used for fibril formation assays. Chemical desulfation was performed on two independent preparations of HS, both of which were used to verify desulfation by disaccharide analysis, and one of which was used for fibril formation assay. We have previously shown that β-TC3 proteoglycans from medium and cell layer bind human IAPP equivalently (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); therefore, we only analyzed the binding ability of proteoglycans from medium for the first portion of the study. [35S]sulfate-labeled total medium proteoglycans were applied to an IAPP affinity column and eluted over a 0.25–3 m NaCl gradient (Fig. 1A). The six fractions demarcated in Fig. 1A were collected, and the nature of the proteoglycans in these fractions was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). Proteoglycans in the low molecular weight M3 pool (eluted in fraction 1), which we have previously shown to be comprised of chondroitin/dermatan-free glycosaminoglycans (12Potter-Perigo S. Hull R.L. Tsoi C. Braun K.R. Andrikopoulos S. Teague J. Bruce Verchere C. Kahn S.E. Wight T.N. Proteoglycans synthesized and secreted by pancreatic islet β-cells bind amylin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), did not bind IAPP, demonstrated by elution at low NaCl. Material from pool M2 contains proteoglycans that bound IAPP with intermediate (fractions 2–4) and high affinity (fractions 5 and 6), whereas proteoglycans from M1 bound IAPP with high affinity (eluted in fractions 5 and 6). IAPP binding of the proteoglycans in pools M1 and M2 was further investigated by solid phase binding assay. As expected, proteoglycans from both M1 and M2 bound IAPP (Fig. 1C, upper row). Binding of proteoglycans from both M1 and M2 was markedly reduced following treatment with heparinases I, II, and III (Fig. 1C, middle row), suggesting that the binding of IAPP by β-TC3 proteoglycans requires HS. Chondroitinase ABC treatment was not associated with a reduction in IAPP binding (Fig. 1C, lower row). If anything, chondroitinase treatment resulted in an increase in IAPP binding, suggesting both that chondroitin/dermatan sulfate are not important for the binding of IAPP and may even impede the binding of IAPP by β-TC3 HSPGs. Thus, HS from β-TC3 proteoglycans in both pools M1 and M2 appeared to mediate IAPP binding. For compositional analysis of HS, we used total HS pooled from both medium and cell layer. As described above, we have previously shown that glycosaminoglycans from β-TC3 medium versus cell layer are very similar with respect to molecular weight, heparinase/chondroitinase sensitivity, and IAPP binding capacity (12Potter-Perigo S.
