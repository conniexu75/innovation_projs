https://openalex.org/W2037113953,"A cDNA encoding a human cytochrome P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenase was isolated from a human liver cDNA library. Sequence analysis revealed that this 1,876-base pair cDNA contained an open reading frame and encoded a new 502-amino acid protein designated CYP2J2. Blot hybridization analysis of RNA prepared from human tissues revealed that CYP2J2 was highly expressed in the heart. Recombinant CYP2J2 protein was prepared using the baculovirus expression system and purified to near electrophoretic homogeneity. The enzyme metabolized arachidonic acid predominantly via olefin epoxidation to all four regioisomeric cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (catalytic turnover 65 pmol of product formed/nmol of cytochrome P450/min at 30°C). Epoxidation of arachidonic acid by CYP2J2 at the 14,15-olefin was highly enantioselective for (14R,15S)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (76% optical purity). Immunoblotting of microsomal fractions prepared from human tissues using a polyclonal antibody raised against the recombinant hemoprotein confirmed primary expression of CYP2J2 protein in human heart. The in vivo significance of CYP2J2 was suggested by documenting the presence of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the human heart using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. Importantly, the chirality of CYP2J2 products matched that of the epoxyeicosatrienoic acid enantiomers present, in vivo, in human heart. We propose that CYP2J2 is one of the enzymes responsible for epoxidation of endogenous arachidonic acid pools in human heart and that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids may, therefore, play important functional roles in cardiac physiology.

Studies utilizing both purified and recombinant P450 enzymes have shown that (a) the epoxygenase reaction is enantioselective, (b) the reaction asymmetry is P450 enzyme specific, and (c) the predominant epoxygenase isoforms belong to the CYP2 gene family(4.Capdevila J.H.

The potential physiological significance of the epoxygenase reaction is highlighted by the fact that the EETs possess numerous biological activities including modulation of membrane ion fluxes, stimulation of peptide hormone release, and effects on airway smooth muscle (Refs. 6 and 16-19 and references therein). Recent studies demonstrating that (a) the rat renal epoxygenase is under regulatory control by dietary salt, (b) alterations of the rat renal epoxygenase induce hypertension in rats fed a high salt diet, and (c) urinary excretion of epoxygenase metabolites is increased during pregnancy-induced hypertension in humans have supported the hypothesis that P450-derived arachidonic acid metabolites may be involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension(5.Capdevila J.H.

For example, EETs cause renal artery vasoconstriction(14.Katoh T. Takahashi K. Capdevila J. Karara A. Falck J.R. Jacobson H.R. Badr K.F. Am. J.

P450 has been identified using spectral, immunologic, and/or monooxygenase activity assays in heart microsomal fractions from several vertebrate species including scup, rat, rabbit, and pig (28.Stegeman J.J.

In addition, aromatic hydrocarbons have been shown to induce P450 activity in scup, chick embryo, and rabbit heart(30.Abraham N.G. Pinto A. Levere R.D. Mullane K. J. Mol. Cell.

Despite these studies, the identity of the P450 isoforms present in heart tissues has not been reported. Furthermore, the function of this ubiquitous enzyme system in the heart remains unknown. In this report, we describe the cloning and cDNA-directed expression of a new human P450 arachidonic acid epoxygenase that is highly expressed in human heart. We also show that human heart contains substantial quantities of endogenous EETs and that the chirality of these EETs matches that of those produced by the recombinant enzyme. [α-32P]dATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [1-14C]arachidonic acid were purchased from DuPont NEN. Restriction enzymes, Escherichia coli polymerase I, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Triphenylphosphine, α-bromo-2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorotoluene, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N,N-dimethylformamide, and diazald were purchased from Aldrich. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Normal human tissues obtained through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (National Disease Research Interchange, Philadelphia) were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained at −80°C for up to 6 months prior to use. Rabbit tissues were obtained from male New Zealand White rabbits sacrificed by lethal intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital. Poly(A)+ mRNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/oligo(dT)-cellulose method using total RNA extraction and mRNA purification kits supplied by Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Oligo(dT)-primed Uni-Zap cDNA libraries were synthesized from human kidney and liver poly(A)+ mRNA using a Lambda Zap-cDNA synthesis kit obtained from Stratagene following the manufacturer's instructions. The human kidney cDNA library had an amplified titre of 3.6 × 109 pfu/ml and an average insert size of 1.5 kb. The human liver cDNA library had an amplified titre of 4.8 × 109 pfu/ml and an average insert size of 2.0 kb. The human kidney library was screened with a 1.6-kb cDNA fragment containing parts of the published sequence of human CYP2C10, including the untranslated 3′-end regions(34.Umbenhauer D.R. Martin M.V. Lloyd R.S. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35.Ged C. Umbenhauer D.R. Bellew T.M. Bork R.W. Srivastava P.K. Shinriki N. Lloyd R.S. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6929-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105 phage were plated, employing XL-1 Blue E. coli as host, at a density of 104 pfu/plate. Nucleic acid hybridizations were done at 57°C in 0.9 M NaCl containing 0.05 M NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, 0.01 M EDTA, 5 × Denhart's solution, and 0.1 mg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. Approximately 140 duplicate positive clones were identified, of which 35 clones, selected at random, were plaque purified and rescued into pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene). Plasmid DNAs were replicated in DH5α competent E. coli (InVitrogen) grown in Luria's Broth containing 0.1 mg of ampicillin/ml and isolated using a Qiagen plasmid purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Insert sizes were determined by agarose electrophoresis after EcoRI and XhoI digestion of the purified plasmids. The pBluescript cDNA inserts were partially sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and the T3 and T7 oligonucleotide primers. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by searching GenBank and EMBL data bases utilizing GCG software (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI). One of the duplicate positive clones (clone DZ1, 0.9-kb cDNA insert) contained a new sequence, which shared 50-60% identity with several human and rodent CYP2 family P450 cDNAs and 83% identity with a rabbit P450, CYP2J1 (36.Kikuta Y. Sogawa K. Haniu M. Kinosaki M. Kusunose E. Nojima Y. Yamamoto S. Ichihara K. Kusunose M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17821-17825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleic acid blot hybridization analysis using total RNA prepared from human liver, kidney, and lung demonstrated that RNA transcripts that hybridized to the cDNA insert contained within this clone were more abundant in human liver as compared with human kidney or lung. As a result, this new human cDNA fragment, which was deemed too short to code for a functional P450 protein, was used as a probe to screen a human liver library to isolate the corresponding full-length cDNA. Approximately 5 × 105 plaques were screened, and 25 of 52 duplicate positive clones were plaque purified, rescued into pBluescript SK(+), and characterized. Five of the clones contained nucleotide sequences that were identical and shared homology with several human and rodent CYP2 family P450s. One of these clones (clone SW2-14, 1.9 kb) was completely sequenced, utilizing a total of 16 oligonucleotide primers (20-25 nucleotides each) that spanned the entire length of the sense and antisense cDNA strands. The entire sequence was confirmed on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) using a PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and purified using G-25 Sephadex columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Total RNA (20 μg) prepared from human tissues was denatured and electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.2 M formaldehyde. After capillary-pressure transfer to GeneScreen Plus nylon membranes (DuPont NEN), the blots were hybridized with the cloned 1.9-kb SW2-14 cDNA insert. Poly (A)+ mRNA (5 μg) prepared from rabbit tissues was electrophoresed, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with either the 1.9-kb SW2-14 cDNA insert or with the following rabbit CYP2J1 sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (5′-GCTGTAATTTTGATCCAGTTTCCTCAGAGGCTAATTTCTCTGATATTTCC-3′, complementary to residues 1615-1664 of the rabbit CYP2J1 cDNA) (36.Kikuta Y. Sogawa K. Haniu M. Kinosaki M. Kusunose E. Nojima Y. Yamamoto S. Ichihara K. Kusunose M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17821-17825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed at 42°C in 50% formamide containing 1 M NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, and 0.1 mg of heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml. Double-stranded cDNA probes were labeled by nick translation using E. coli polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP. Oligonucleotide probes were end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. High yield expression of the protein encoded by the cloned 1.9-kb SW-14 cDNA insert (human CYP2J2) ( 3The new sequence that is reported in this paper was submitted to the Committee on Standardized Cytochrome P450 Nomenclature and has been designated CYP2J2.) was accomplished using the MAXBAC baculovirus expression system (InVitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cultured SF9 insect cells were cotransfected with a pBlueBacIII transfer vector containing the CYP2J2 cDNA and wild-type baculovirus DNA in a cationic liposome. Recombinant viruses were purified, and the presence of a CYP2J2 cDNA insert was corroborated by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cultured SF9 cells grown in spinner flasks at a density of 1.5-2 × 106 cells/ml were then infected with high titre CYP2J2 recombinant baculovirus stock in the presence of 5 μM hemin, and cells expressing recombinant CYP2J2 were harvested 72 h after infection, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) sodium cholate, 0.1 μM EDTA, and 0.1 μM dithiothreitol. Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the P450 content of the resulting crude cell lysate was determined spectrally according to the method of Omura and Sato (37.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual-wavelength/double-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). For purification of recombinant CYP2J2, the P450 and sodium cholate concentrations of the crude cell lysate were adjusted to 1 μM and 0.4%, respectively. The resulting suspension was loaded by gravity at room temperature onto a 3 × 5-cm ω-aminooctyl-agarose (Sigma) column equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μM EDTA, 0.1 μM dithiothreitol, and 0.4% (w/v) sodium cholate (buffer A). The column was washed with 4 column volumes of buffer A, and the bound CYP2J2 was eluted with buffer A containing 0.4% (v/v) Emulgen 911 (Kao Chemical Co., Tokyo). After dialysis versus 200 volumes of 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) sodium cholate, 0.1 μM EDTA, and 0.1 μM dithiothreitol (buffer B), the CYP2J2 sample was loaded onto a 1 × 5-cm hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.4% (v/v) Emulgen 911. The column was washed with 6 column volumes of equilibration buffer, 4 column volumes of 0.04 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μM EDTA, 0.1 μM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) sodium cholate, and 0.4% (v/v) Emulgen 911, and the bound CYP2J2 was eluted with 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μM EDTA, 0.1 μM dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) sodium cholate, and 0.4% (v/v) Emulgen 911 and dialyzed versus 200 volumes of buffer B. Alternatively, the recombinant P450 was eluted using a stepwise gradient from 0.02 to 0.1 M sodium phosphate containing buffer. To remove free Emulgen 911, dialyzed CYP2J2 was loaded onto a second hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with buffer B and washed with 20-30 column volumes of buffer B (until the eluent absorbance at 280 nm reached a constant minimum). The CYP2J2 was eluted with 0.2 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 μM EDTA, 0.1 μM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium cholate, dialyzed versus 400 column volumes of cholate-free buffer B, and concentrated using a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon). Recombinant CYP2J2 was subjected to N-terminal amino acid analysis and molecular mass determination by mass spectrometry. For N-terminal amino acid analysis(38.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), partially purified CYP2J2 was electrophoresed on SDS, 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels (200 × 200 × 1 mm), electroblotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad), and sequenced directly in the membrane after removal of the protein stain using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Cycle yields were calculated by comparison with internal standards. For molecular mass determination, recombinant CYP2J2 was analyzed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Houston, TX) using bovine serum albumin (M+H and M+2H) as an external mass calibrant and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Polyclonal antibodies against human CYP2J2 were prepared by immunizing two New Zealand White rabbits with partially purified CYP2J2 protein in Freund's complete adjuvant as described (39.Serabjit-Singh C.J. Wolf C.R. Philpot R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9901-9907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Booster doses of immunogen were administered at 4-6-week intervals in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Pre-immune serum, collected from the rabbits prior to immunization, did not cross-react with CYP2J2 or with microsomal fractions prepared from human tissues. Immune serum from both rabbits gave identical patterns on immunoblots of human microsomal fractions. IgG fractions were isolated from the immune serum of one of the rabbits using an ImmunoPure IgG purification kit (Pierce). IgG was affinity purified by passage over an SF9 cell lysate column prepared using the AminoLink immobilization kit (Pierce). Microsomal fractions were prepared from normal human tissues by differential centrifugation at 4°C as described previously (40.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and stored at −80°C until use. Microsomal fractions prepared from human lymphoblast cells transfected with cDNAs to human CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2E1, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 were purchased from GENTEST. Cell lysates prepared from SF9 cells infected with recombinant CYP2C8 baculovirus were used as a source of human CYP2C8 (10.Zeldin D.C. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem.

For immunoblotting, microsomal fractions, cell lysates, and/or partially purified CYP2J2 were electrophoresed in SDS-10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (80 × 80 × 1 mm) and the resolved proteins transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted using affinity-purified rabbit-anti human CYP2J2 IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Purified rat liver NADPH-P450 reductase was a gift from Dr. Masahiko Negishi (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health). The catalytic activity of CYP2J2 toward arachidonic acid was determined by mixing purified, recombinant CYP2J2 with NADPH-P450 reductase (1 μM each, final concentration) in the presence of sonicated L-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (50 μg/ml, final concentration). After 20 min at room temperature, the enzyme mixture was diluted to the final reaction volume with 0.05 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 8 mM sodium isocitrate, and 0.5 IU of isocitrate dehydrogenase/ml and equilibrated at 30°C for 2 min prior to the addition of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (25-55 μCi/μmol, 100 μM, final concentration). Reactions were initiated with NADPH (1 mM, final concentration) and continued at 30°C with constant mixing. At different time points, samples of the reaction mixture were extracted into ethyl ether, dried under a nitrogen stream, resolved by reversed-phase HPLC, and quantified by on-line liquid scintillation using a Radiomatic Flo-One β-detector (Radiomatic Instruments, Tampa, FL)(40.Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For chiral analysis, the EETs were collected from the HPLC eluent, derivatized to corresponding EET-PFB or EET-methyl esters, purified by normal-phase HPLC, resolved into the corresponding antipodes by chiral-phase HPLC, and quantified by liquid scintillation as described previously(41.Capdevila J.H.

The benzphetamine N-demethylase activity of recombinant CYP2J2 was assessed using the same purified enzyme preparation under identical reaction conditions but employing benzphetamine (2 mM, final concentration) as the substrate. The reaction product (formaldehyde) was quantified according to the method of Nash(43.Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the formaldehyde colorimetric assay was 10-6M. Methods used to quantify endogenous EETs present in human heart were similar to those used to quantify EETs in rat liver (11.Karara A. Dishman E. Blair I. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, pathologically normal human heart tissues (1.5-2.0 g) were frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately homogenized in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing triphenylphosphine (5-10 mg). The homogenate was extracted twice, under acidic conditions, with two volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and once more with an equal volume of chloroform, and the combined organic phases were evaporated in tubes containing mixtures of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-[1-14C]EET internal standards (55-57 μCi/μmol, 30 ng each). Saponification to recover phospholipid-bound EETs was followed by silica column purification. The eluent, containing a mixture of radiolabeled internal standards and total endogenous EETs, was resolved into individual regioisomers and enantiomers by HPLC as described(11.Karara A. Dishman E.

For analysis, aliquots of individual EET-PFB esters were dissolved in dodecane and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy on a Kratos Concept ISQ mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Inc. Ramsey, NJ) operating under negative ion chemical ionization conditions, at 5.3 keV accelerating potential, at a mass resolution of 1200 and using methane as a bath gas. Quantifications were made by selected ion monitoring at m/z 319 (loss of PFB from endogenous EET-PFB) and m/z 321 (loss of PFB from [1-14C]EET-PFB internal standard). The EET-PFB/[1-14C]EET-PFB ratios were calculated from the integrated values of the corresponding ion current intensities. The EET internal standards were synthesized from [1-14C]arachidonic acid (55-57 μCi/μmol) by nonselective epoxidation as described prev"

We have previously shown that the drug-induced HSF1 becomes associated with the heat shock elements of the hsp70 promoter, yet transcription of the hsp70 gene is not induced (Jurivich, D. A., Sistonen, L., Kroes, R. A., and Morimoto, R. I. (1992) Science 255, 1243-1245). In this study, we have examined the basis for uncoupling the heat shock transcriptional response. Comparison of heat shock and drug-induced forms of HSF1 has revealed that the transcriptionally inert drug-induced HSF1 is constitutively but not inducibly serine-phosphorylated, whereas heat shock-induced HSF1 is both constitutively and inducibly serine-phosphorylated. The transcriptionally inert intermediate represented by drug-induced HSF1 can be converted to the transcriptionally active state by a subsequent exposure to heat shock. The only detectable change in HSF1 is the acquisition of inducible serine phosphorylation. These data reveal that acquisition of the trimeric DNA binding state of HSF1 is independent of and precedes inducible phosphorylation and furthermore that inducible phosphorylation correlates with transcriptional activation."

Gap junctions form between hexameric structures of connexin molecules (connexons) that interact with connexons in neighboring cells to form membrane pores(4.Caspar D.L.D. Goodenough D.A. Makowski L.

Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Connexins are a conserved family of proteins with four membrane-spanning regions and with cytoplasmic amino and carboxyl termini, yielding one intracellular and two extracellular loops. GJC is known to be regulated by posttranslational phosphorylation on connexin-43 (Cx43). Musil et al.(6.Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a basal level of posttranslational phosphorylation on serine residues in Cx43 may be essential for functional assembly and activation of gap junctions. Up-regulation of GJC has been associated with increased levels of cyclic AMP and increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43(7.Flagg-Newton J.L. Dahl G. Lowenstein W.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 63: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 8.Saez J.C. Spray D.C. Nairn A.C. Hertberg E. Greengard P. Bennett M.V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

GJC and serine phosphorylation on Cx43 were also up-regulated in communication-deficient S180 mouse cells following transfection with liver cell adhesion molecule DNA(6.Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of GJC has been associated with increased tyrosine and/or serine phosphorylation on Cx43(9.Takeda A. Saheki S. Shimazu T. Takeuchi N. J. Biochem.

Down-regulation of GJC was associated with increased serine phosphorylation in cells expressing the ras oncogene (10.Brissette J.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF; (13.Lau A.F. Kanemitsu M.Y. Kurata W.E. Danesh S. Boynton A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and (14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 999-1003PubMed Google Scholar) and fps(16.Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 329-335PubMed Google Scholar) transformed cells. Studies from this laboratory have demonstrated that Cx43 can serve as a direct substrate for the pp60src tyrosine kinase(17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), however, it is not known whether the fps kinase directly phosphorylates Cx43 or activates a downstream tyrosine kinase responsible for Cx43 phosphorylation(16.Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 329-335PubMed Google Scholar). The possible increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43 in cells transformed by the src and fps oncogenes is presumably mediated by the activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases through signal transduction events. A rapid and transient decrease in GJC, which correlated with an increase in serine phosphorylation on Cx43, was observed in T51B rat liver epithelial cells following stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; (13.Lau A.F. Kanemitsu M.Y. Kurata W.E. Danesh S. Boynton A.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and (14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)). The data suggested that the receptor tyrosine kinase activated a downstream serine/threonine kinase(s) that phosphorylated Cx43. The identity of this kinase(s) and the specific Cx43 sites phosphorylated have not been characterized. EGF stimulates pathways that lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC; (18.Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 156-194Crossref Scopus (2455) Google Scholar) and (19.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar)). However, down-regulation of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-sensitive forms of PKC did not prevent EGF-induced disruption of GJC or Cx43 phosphorylation (14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). EGF also activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by signal transduction events that begin with ligand activation of the EGFR and proceed through a sequence of protein-protein interactions coupled to a protein kinase cascade(20.Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 201-209Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21.Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Paul A. Graham A. McLees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem.

MAPK was activated in EGF-treated T51B rat liver epithelial cells with kinetics that supported a potential role for MAPK in signal transduction events leading to Cx43 phosphorylation or perhaps in directly phosphorylating Cx43(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43 possesses three putative consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequences PX1−2(S/T)P(23.Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Alvarez E. Northwood I.C. Gonzalez F.A. Latour D.A. Seth A. Abate C. Curran T. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), underlined in Fig. 1. Furthermore, activated MAPK may phosphorylate Cx43 directly in vivo, since MAPK phosphorylated Cx43 in vitro on phosphotryptic peptides that comigrated with a subset of EGF-responsive phosphotryptic peptides obtained from Cx43 phosphorylated in vivo in EGF-stimulated cells(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Although it is known that GJC can be regulated by posttranslational phosphorylation on connexin, little is known about the molecular sites in the connexin molecule that are critical for regulating intercellular communication through gap junctions. The increased phosphorylation on Cx43 at specific serine sites that follows activation of the EGFR may be the direct cause of the observed functional disruption of GJC. Thus, EGF-induced phosphorylation provides an excellent system for the identification of sites in Cx43 critical to GJC and for the characterization of the signal transduction events leading from the EGF receptor to the activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases that mediate Cx43 phosphorylation. The studies presented here were carried out to further delineate the role of MAPK in Cx43 phosphorylation by identifying specific MAPK serine phosphorylation sites on Cx43. We utilized a GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43 (GST-Cx43-CT; (17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)) as a MAPK substrate and have identified the sites of phosphorylation by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, phosphotryptic peptide mapping, and peptide sequence analysis. The results of these studies support the concept that MAPK phosphorylates Cx43 in vivo in response to a signal transduced by the activated EGFR and define the phosphorylation sites in Cx43 that may be directly related to the functional disruption of GJC observed in EGF-treated cells. T51B rat liver epithelial cells were cultured in Eagle's (BME) medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Confluent, quiescent monolayers were metabolically labeled with (32Pi) (NEX-053, DuPont NEN) at 3 mCi/ml in phosphate-deficient medium for 3 h at 37°C as described(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). During the last 30 min of the labeling period, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml EGF (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). At the end of the labeling period, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 160 μM Na3VO4, and Cx43 was immunoprecipitated from clarified lysate with rabbit antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of Cx43 (amino acids 368-382). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels, and radiolabeled Cx43 was visualized by autoradiography. Full-length Cx43 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the rat Cx43 cDNA(17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Cx43 was isolated from Sf9 cell homogenates by detergent extraction of the membrane pellet and was immunoaffinity purified by incubation with a monoclonal antibody to Cx43, chemically coupled to protein G-Sepharose, as described(17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43 (amino acids 236-382, see Fig. 1) was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleotides 907-1356 of the rat Cx43 cDNA and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of the pGEX-KG expression vector as described(17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This construct is referred to as wild type (wt) GST-Cx43-CT. Deletion mutants were prepared by recombinant polymerase chain reaction (26.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar) using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers designed to delete nucleotides encoding amino acids 253-256 (PLSP) or amino acids 274-284 (PTAPLSPMSPP) of Cx43 as described. ( 2M. Y. Kanemitsu, L. W. M. Loo, A. F. Lau, and W. Eckhart, manuscript in preparation.) Underlined amino acids represent the consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequences (serine sites 255, 279, and 282). Deletion mutants were cloned into the pGEX 2TK expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.). Serine site mutants of GST-Cx43-CT were prepared from double-stranded DNA (Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) with oligonucleotide primers (Ransom Hill Biosciences, Inc.) designed to alter a serine residue to alanine: primer 5′-CTGGCCCACTGGCCCCATCAAAAGAC-3′ was used to alter the AGC codon for Ser255 to GCC, a codon for alanine (mutant S255A), and primer 5′-GCTCCACTCGCGCCTATGGCTCCTCCTGG-3′ was used to alter the codons for Ser279 (TCG) and Ser282 (TCT) to codons for alanine (GCG and GCT, respectively; double mutant S279A,S282A). Selection for mutants was provided by the simultaneous use of a selection primer (27.Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) designed to eliminate a unique restriction site in the parental DNA (AlwNI at position 2617 or MluI at position 3647 in the pGEX-KG expression plasmid). The fidelity of all GST-Cx43-CT mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing (28.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) by induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were lysed by brief sonication on ice in PBS with 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then solubilized with 1% Triton X-100. GST fusion proteins were affinity purified from clarified cell lysates by a 2-h incubation at 4°C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B-agarose beads (Sigma) followed by extensive washes with PBS(17.Loo L.W.M. Berestecky J.M. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12751-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). MAPK assays were carried out with GST-Cx43-CT fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (10 μl). The beads were washed three times with cold kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and then incubated for 15 min at 30°C in kinase buffer with the addition of purified MAPK (0.1-1 μl) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp., 6000 Ci/mmol) per reaction. Full-length Cx43, isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, was phosphorylated by MAPK in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 0.2 μg of Cx43. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 × SDS sample buffer and heating the sample tubes in boiling water. To phosphorylate preparative amounts of GST-Cx43-CT, 500 μl of beads was incubated in the same kinase buffer with 250 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1.5 μl of MAPK, and the addition of 0.16 μmol of unlabeled ATP. Two MAPK preparations were used in these studies: (i) activated, recombinant human MAPK produced in Sf9 cells coinfected with Raf-1 and v-Ras(29.Williams N.G. Paradis H. Agarwal S. Charest D.L.

Natalie Ahn, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO and Melanie Cobb, University of Texas, Dallas, TX). The histidine tag on the bacterially expressed recombinant MAPK and MEK allowed for rapid and convenient purification of these kinases without significant loss of enzymatic activity. The His-tagged, activated rat MAPK preparation was used for all the in vitro phosphorylations in the figures presented in this paper. The deletion mutants of GST-Cx43-CT were phosphorylated with the activated human MAPK preparation from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Phosphotryptic peptide maps were prepared as described by Boyle et al.(33.Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) and Kanemitsu and Lau(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, MAPK-phosphorylated GST-Cx43-CT fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The protein bands were excised from the wet gel and extracted with a buffer containing 50 mM NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. SDS was removed from the samples by precipitating the proteins with cold trichloroacetic acid in the presence of carrier protein (RNase A, 10-20 μg). Precipitated proteins were washed with ice-cold acetone, oxidized with performic acid at 0°C, lyophilized to dryness, and then digested overnight at 37°C with TPCK-treated trypsin (Worthington). Phosphotryptic peptides were resolved on thin-layer cellulose chromatography (TLC) plates (EM Scientific) by electrophoresis for 65 min at 1000 V in pH 1.9 buffer (2.5% formic acid (88%), 7.8% glacial acetic acid, v/v), followed by ascending liquid chromatography in the second dimension in isobutyric acid buffer (62.5% isobutyric acid, 1.9% n-butanol, 4.8% pyridine, 2.9% glacial acetic acid, v/v). Phosphorylated peptides were visualized by autoradiography at −70°C with the aid of an intensifying screen. MAPK-phosphorylated wt and deletion mutants of GST-Cx43-CT produced the same phosphorylation patterns when the kinase reactions were carried out in solution with proteins eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μg of fusion protein/reaction), indicating that phosphorylation was not hindered when the fusion proteins were immobilized on beads. Tryptic digests of preparative amounts of MAPK-phosphorylated wt GST-Cx43-CT were prepared as described, except that the carrier protein (RNase A) was omitted during trichloroacetic acid precipitation and a sequencing grade of TPCK-treated trypsin was used for digestions (Promega). Tryptic digests were fractionated by HPLC on a Bio-Rad Microsorb CB reverse phase column (5 μm, 300 Å) using a water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid gradient that changed from 85.9/14/0.1 to 75.9/24/0.1 over 30 min. Fractions were collected every minute, and the radioactive fractions were characterized by their migration on two-dimensional phosphotryptic maps. The fraction that migrated with peptide b was identified and submitted for protein sequence analysis (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) and Edman degradation ((34.Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. VI. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 117-123Google Scholar); University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described (35.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) on tryptic digests of MAPK-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins. An earlier study demonstrated that numerous tryptic peptides were nominally phosphorylated in Cx43 isolated from control-treated T51B rat liver epithelial cells and that phosphorylation on these same peptides was markedly enhanced (∽3-fold) in cells treated with EGF(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that a membrane preparation of full-length Cx43, isolated from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, was phosphorylated by purified MAPK in vitro on four tryptic peptides that comigrated with a subset of the EGF-responsive tryptic peptides obtained from Cx43 phosphorylated in vivo in EGF-treated cells(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Three putative consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequences are present in the cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43 (underlined in Fig. 1). We utilized a GST fusion protein, containing the carboxyl-terminal tail of Cx43 (Val236-Ile382), as a substrate to identify MAPK phosphorylation sites. Activated MAPK was prepared in vitro by phosphorylation with constitutively active MAPK kinase (MEK; (31.Robbins D.J. Zhem E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The two MAPK preparations yielded similar phosphorylation patterns for wt GST-Cx43-CT and for serine site mutants of GST-Cx43-CT (data not shown). MAPK-phosphorylated full-length Cx43 and wt GST-Cx43-CT were excised from SDS-PAGE gels (see Fig. 2), eluted, and subjected to tryptic digestion as described under “Materials and Methods.” Multiple phosphopeptides were observed on two-dimensional tryptic analysis of Cx43 (Fig. 3A) and wt GST-Cx43-CT (Fig. 3B). Peptides a-d are labeled according to the corresponding EGF-responsive phosphopeptides of MAPK-phosphorylated full-length Cx43 in a previous study(14.Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphotryptic peptides of wt GST-Cx43-CT comigrated (Fig. 3D) with a subset of the tryptic peptides of Cx43 phosphorylated in vivo when T51B rat cells were treated with EGF (Fig. 3C) and also comigrated with phosphopeptides obtained from full-length Cx43 phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro (data not shown). Control reactions, performed in the absence of MAPK, failed to phosphorylate full-length Cx43 or wt GST-Cx43-CT, indicating that endogenous kinases, capable of phosphorylating these substrates, were not present in these preparations (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 5). The GST portion of the fusion protein was not significantly phosphorylated by MAPK (∽0.13% and 0.35% of wt GST-Cx43-CT in two experiments, see Fig. 2, lane 1) and autophosphorylation was not detected in the kinase alone control reaction (data not shown). These data demonstrated that the major MAPK target sites in Cx43 are located in the cytoplasmic, carboxyl-terminal tail (Val236-Ile382) and that GST-Cx43-CT is a suitable substrate to characterize in vitro MAPK phosphorylation of Cx43.Figure 3:Two-dimensional phosphotryptic peptide maps of 32P-labeled Cx43.

To identify tryptic peptides in Cx43 phosphorylated by MAPK, we utilized GST-Cx43-CT mutants with deletions of the proline-rich consensus MAPK phosphorylation sequences (Fig. 1, enclosed amino acids). The deletion of Pro253-Pro256 (Δ253-256) or Pro274-Pro284 (Δ274-284) was expected to alter the mobility of the peptides containing these amino acids (predicted tryptic peptides Ser244-Lys258 and Tyr265-Lys287, respectively). These mutant peptides are smaller and have a different amino acid composition than those in wt GST-Cx43-CT and, thus, will migrate differently on two-dimensional analysis. The phosphopeptide map of the Cx43 Δ253-256 mutant contained phosphopeptides b and c; however, phosphopeptides d and e were absent (data not shown; refer to wt GST-Cx43-CT for phosphopeptide labeling, Fig. 3B). This indicated that the Ser244-Lys258 tryptic peptide contained a site phosphorylated by MAPK in wt GST-Cx43-CT. Furthermore, it was clear that phosphopeptides d and e are related, since both disappeared when the Ser255 consensus sequence was deleted. Tryptic phosphopeptide analysis of the MAPK-phosphorylated Cx43 Δ274-284 mutant produced a phosphopeptide map where phosphopeptides b and c were absent, but peptides d and e were present (data not shown). Therefore, the deleted amino acids (PTAPLSPMSPP) contain a site(s) phosphorylated by MAPK in wt GST-Cx43-CT. A synthetic peptide containing this deleted region and corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 17 amino acids of the Tyr265-Lys287 tryptic peptide (NH2-CSSPTAPLSPMSPPGYK-COOH) was also phosphorylated by MAPK, confirming the presence of a phosphorylation site(s) in the Tyr265-Lys287 peptide (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2060588008,"A number of studies have demonstrated that the proliferative capacity of cells declines with aging. In particular, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis is reduced in hepatocytes from aged rats relative to young rats. Growth factor stimulation activates a genetic program in large part regulated by a family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that phosphorylate and thereby activate transcription factors involved in controlling the expression of proliferation-associated genes. In the present study, we compared the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) MAPK in EGF-stimulated hepatocytes derived from young (6-month) and aged (24-month) rats. JNK activity was not appreciably altered by EGF treatment of cells from either age group. In contrast, ERK2 was highly activated by EGF treatment, but the magnitude of activation was significantly lower in hepatocytes of aged animals compared to those of young animals (7-fold versus 20-fold, respectively). The reduced ERK2 activity in response to EGF was associated with decreased c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression and lower levels of AP-1 transcription factor DNA binding activity in the aged hepatocytes. Finally, the basal expression of MAPK phosphatase 1, a MAPK-regulated gene involved in regulating MAPK activity, was higher in aged hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings suggest that an alteration in the balance between MAP kinase-phosphatase activities could contribute to the age-related decline in proliferative capacity.

Briefly, growth factor binding results in receptor autophosphorylation, leading to the sequential activation of Ras and Raf. Raf then phosphorylates MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which in turn activates ERK through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues. JNK is also activated by growth factor stimulation(3.Dérijard B.

Pereira-Smith O.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Peacocke M. Campisi J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In in vitro human diploid fibroblasts, the decline in proliferative capacity is correlated with a decrease in c-fos expression(27.Peacocke M. Campisi J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), as well as with reduced DNA binding activity of serum response factor and AP-1 transcription factors(28.Atadja P.W.

Following partial hepatectomy, DNA synthesis is delayed and reduced in magnitude in aged rats compared to young adults(30.Bucher N.L.R. Swaffield M.N. DiTroia J.F. Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 509-512PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis in primary hepatocytes from aged rats is also significantly lower than that seen in EGF-treated hepatocytes from young animals(31.Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).In order to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the loss of responsiveness to EGF with aging, we compared the activation of ERK2 and JNK1 MAPK in EGF-stimulated primary hepatocytes from young and aged rats. We report here that hepatocytes of aged rats show significantly lower levels of ERK2 activation in response to EGF stimulation compared to hepatocytes from young rats. The activation of JNK in response to EGF, on the other hand, did not differ between young and old hepatocytes. Consistent with the reduced ERK2 activity, induction of c-fos and c-jun expression and AP-1 DNA binding activity following EGF stimulation were also lower in aged hepatocytes. Interestingly, aged hepatocytes showed significantly higher basal levels of MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) expression compared to that of young hepatocytes, although induction of MKP-1 following EGF treatment was lower in the old cells. Taken together, these results suggest that an alteration in the balance of kinase-phosphatase activities could contribute to the age-related decline in proliferative capacity.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation, Culture, and Treatment of Rat HepatocytesHepatocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats by the collagenase perfusion method of Seglen as described(32.Ishigami A. Roth G.S. J. Cell Physiol. 1994; 158: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The isolated cells were plated in Williams E medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 2 h at 37°C under 5% CO2 to allow attachment. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were cultured for an additional 16 h prior to treatment. This procedure results in less than 2-5% contamination with non-hepatocytes. EGF was added to the medium to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml.Western and Northern Blot AnalysesFor Western blot analysis, total cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were size-fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using standard techniques(25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Following immunoblotting of membranes with a monoclonal antibody against ERK2 (Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY), the immune complexes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham).For RNA analysis, cells were harvested at various time points following treatment, and total RNA was extracted using Stat 60 (Teltest “B,” Friendswood, TX). Northern blot analysis was performed using rat c-jun, c-fos, MKP-1 cDNA probes, and 18 S oligonucleotide as described previously(25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Protein Kinase AssaysHepatocytes (at approximately 70% confluence) were treated with EGF and harvested at various times thereafter for assay as described previously(25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Briefly, endogenous ERK2 or JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p42ERK2 or p46JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. ERK2 and JNK1 activities were assayed as described previously using bovine brain myelin basic protein (MBP) and recombinant GST-c-Jun-1-135 (4.Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2408) Google Scholar) substrates, respectively(25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). After completion of the reaction, the proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Incorporation of 32P into the substrates was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).Gel Retardation AnalysisProtein extracts (20 μg of protein) were mixed with 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double strand oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP-1-binding sequence (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) in a total volume of 50 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.Statistical AnalysisUnpaired Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance of differences. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSEGF-stimulated ERK2 ActivationERK2 activation was assessed by both Western blot analysis and immune complex kinase assays. Fig. 1A shows a representative Western blot comparing ERK2 protein levels in young (6-month) and old (24-month) hepatocytes following EGF treatment. ERK2 abundance did not change in response to EGF treatment and did not differ between young and old cells. In young hepatocytes, ERK2 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to EGF treatment, as evidenced by a shift in the mobility of the protein; the slower migrating (phosphorylated) form appeared within 15 min and persisted up to 45 min post-treatment. However, EGF-stimulation of old hepatocytes resulted in substantially less phosphorylation of the ERK2 protein.ERK2 activity was assessed over an extended time course in these EGF-treated hepatocytes (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the phosphorylation of ERK2 seen above, the activity of ERK2 in young hepatocytes increased greatly in response to EGF stimulation. Maximum kinase activity (>20-fold elevation) was achieved within 15 min. The activity declined thereafter, returning to baseline levels by 2 h post-treatment. By comparison, EGF stimulation of old hepatocytes resulted in significantly less activation of ERK2 (<7-fold elevation) than seen in young cells. A quantitation of the results of EGF-treated hepatocytes from 4 young and 4 old animals is summarized in Fig. 2. Aged hepatocytes showed a significant decrease in ERK2 activity (>60% decline) relative to young hepatocytes.Figure 2:Statistical analysis of ERK2 activation in hepatocytes from multiple young and old rats.

In previous studies, Ishigami et al.(31.Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) had demonstrated that EGF-induced DNA synthesis was reduced in aged hepatocytes. Since EGF is known to exert its mitogenic effects through activation of MAPK, we compared the relative level of ERK and JNK activation in old versus young hepatocytes. Although no age-related differences in JNK activity were found, a marked reduction in the magnitude of ERK2 activation in response to EGF treatment was found in aged hepatocytes. Reduced activation was shown to be associated with decreased expression of the MAPK-regulated genes c-fos and c-jun and diminished AP-1 DNA binding activity. While the cause for the age-related loss in ERK activation by EGF remains to be determined, it is clearly not the result of a change in ERK protein levels. It also appears not to be due to alterations in either the number or affinity of EGF receptors on hepatocytes, as previous studies by Ishigami et al.(31.Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed no age-related differences in these properties. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the EGF receptor is functionally altered with age.The cascade initiated through EGF stimulation of the EGF receptor that ultimately leads to ERK activation involves several steps and numerous regulatory molecules including Ras, Raf, and MEK(1.Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 6.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Altered activity of any one of these regulatory molecules could contribute to reduced ERK activity. However, our observation that MKP-1 expression is elevated in aged hepatocytes suggests an alternative explanation for the reduced ERK activity. The ability of MKP-1 to dephosphorylate and thereby inactivate ERK is well established(20.Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Even in the absence of alterations in the initiation/activation of the response to EGF, an elevation in basal MKP-1 levels would be expected to perturb the balance between the positive (kinase) and negative (phosphatase) influences on ERK activity and thus result in attenuation of ERK activity. This would further lead to reduced expression of MAPK-regulated genes (as seen for c-fos and c-jun) involved in the mitogenic response and diminished proliferative capacity.MKP-1 expression is highly induced by mitogenic stimulation(24.Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 36.Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190PubMed Google Scholar), presumably through an ERK-mediated pathway. However, MKP-1 can also be induced by treatments in the absence of significant ERK activation(19.Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 25.Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Further elucidation of the mechanisms regulating MKP-1 expression could provide additional insight into the cause and consequence of its elevation in aged hepatocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2060302403,"Studies of dispersed β cells have been used to infer their behavior in the intact pancreatic islet. When dispersed, β cells exhibit multiple metabolic glucose-response populations with different insulin secretion properties. This has led to a model for glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the islet based on a step-wise recruitment of individual β cells. However, previously reported synchronous and uniform Ca2+ activity and electrical responses indicate that β cell behavior within intact islets is more uniform. Therefore, uncertainty remains whether β cell metabolic heterogeneity is functionally important in intact islets. We have used two-photon excitation microscopy to measure and compare the glucose-induced NAD(P)H autofluorescence response in dispersed β cells and within intact islets. Over 90% of β cells in intact islets responded to glucose with significantly elevated NAD(P)H levels, compared with less than 70% of dispersed β cells. In addition, all responding β cells within intact islets exhibited a sigmoidal glucose dose response behavior with inflection points of ∼8 mM glucose. These results suggest that β cell heterogeneity may be functionally less important in the intact islet than has been predicted from studies of dispersed β cells and support the role of glucokinase as the rate-limiting enzyme in the β cell glucose response."
https://openalex.org/W2044138444,"The self-renewing epithelial populations present in the gastric units of the mouse stomach are descended from a multipotent stem cell and undergo an orderly migration-associated differentiation followed by apoptosis. The steady state census of the three principal cell types (acid-producing parietal cells, mucus-producing pit cells, and pepsinogen and intrinsic factor-producing zymogenic cells) is accurately controlled, despite marked differences in the rates of migration of each lineage. A transgenic mouse model has been created to define functional interrelationships between the proliferation, differentiation, and death programs of these lineages. Nucleotides −1035 to +24 of the noncatalytic β subunit gene of mouse H+/K+-ATPase were used to direct expression of an attenuated diphtheria toxin A subunit in the parietal cell lineage. These transcriptional regulatory elements are not active in members of the pit and zymogenic lineages. Stomachs, prepared from postnatal day 28-80 transgenic mice and their normal littermates, were subjected to single- and multilabel immunohistochemical studies as well as qualitative and quantitative light and electron microscopic morphologic analyses. The toxin produced complete ablation of differentiated parietal cells. Loss of parietal cells was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the number of undifferentiated granule-free cells located in the proliferative compartment of gastric units. This amplified population of granule-free cells included the multipotent stem cell as well as committed precursors of the pit and zymogenic lineages. Loss of mature parietal cells was also associated with (i) a block in the differentiation program of the zymogenic lineage with an accumulation of pre-neck cells and a depletion of their neck and mature zymogenic cell descendants, and (ii) an ∼2-fold amplification of pit cells. These findings are consistent with the notion that epithelial homeostasis within gastric units is maintained by instructive interactions between their different cell lineages. Unlike pit and zymogenic cells, parietal cells complete their differentiation in the gastric unit's proliferative compartment before undergoing a bipolar migration along the unit. Thus, the mature parietal cell is in a strategic position to influence decision-making among gastric epithelial cell precursors and to modulate the migration-associated terminal differentiation programs of the pit and zymogenic lineages."

This phosphorylation process is believed to be the triggering mechanism that leads to receptor desensitization. The cellular responses elicited upon activation of G protein-coupled receptors are regulated in a dynamic fashion by the action of two classes of serine/threonine kinases. The first class consists of the second messenger-dependent kinases such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C(1.Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

These receptor kinases were originally described for rhodopsin (rhodopsin kinase) and the β2-adrenergic receptor (β-adrenergic receptor kinase) and are referred to as the G protein-coupled receptor kinases or GRKs( 1The abbreviations used are: GRK G protein-coupled receptor kinase HA hemagglutinin.)

The GRKs are widely distributed in brain and periphery, suggesting an important role in the regulation of responsiveness of various G protein-coupled receptors(2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (GRK2) and β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2 (GRK3) are found in presynaptic and postsynaptic localizations in various brain regions consistent with a general role for these kinases in the desensitization of neuronal G protein-coupled receptors and their putative role in the regulation of neuronal activity. However, little information exists as to the specificity of the various kinases and as to whether phosphorylation of a given receptor by different kinases results in the same attenuation of the biological signals.The recent advent of molecular biology techniques has allowed a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the dopaminergic neurotransmission. So far, five distinct genes encoding at least six dopamine receptors have been isolated and characterized(8.Gingrich J.A. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 9.Jarvie K.R. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Niznik H.B. Dopamine Receptors and Transporters. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 133-150Google Scholar). Dopamine receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. These dopamine receptors are grouped into D1- and D2-like receptors based upon their similarity at the amino acid level and their ability to couple to the activation (D1A/D1 and D1B/D5) or inhibition (D2short, D2long, D3, and D4) of adenylyl cyclase(8.Gingrich J.A. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 299-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 9.Jarvie K.R. Tiberi M. Caron M.G. Niznik H.B. Dopamine Receptors and Transporters. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 133-150Google Scholar). Many of the neurophysiological effects of dopamine in retina and brain are thought to be mediated through the activation of dopamine D1A receptor subtype (10.Clark D. White F.J. Synapse. 1987; 1: 347-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11.Djamgoz M.B. Wagner H.J. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 20: 139-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 12.Drago J. Gerfen C.R.

However, the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the D1A receptor responsiveness are poorly understood. Upon exposure to dopamine, D1A receptors have been shown to undergo a desensitization process as evidenced in cellular systems expressing endogenous D1A receptors or heterologous expression systems(16.Balmforth A.J. Warbuton P. Ball S.G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2111-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Barton A.C. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 531-541PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Chneiweiss H.

Mol. Cel. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) demonstrated using a protein kinase A inhibitor and a GRK inhibitor (heparin) that D1A receptors, expressed endogenously in SK-N-MC cells, could undergo both protein kinase A- and GRK-mediated desensitization. Although a recent study has shown that D1A receptor overexpressed in Sf9 cells can undergo agonist-dependent desensitization, which was associated with weak receptor phosphorylation(22.Ng G.Y.K. Mouillac B. George S.R. Caron M. Dennis M. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sec. 1994; 267: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a convincing demonstration of a role for direct phosphorylation of the receptor in this process remains to be clearly established. Most of the regulation studies performed previously in cellular systems have been limited by the low levels of receptor density(16.Balmforth A.J. Warbuton P. Ball S.G. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 2111-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Barton A.C. Sibley D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 531-541PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Chneiweiss H. Glowinski J. Premont J.

To avoid this difficulty, we have overexpressed the receptor alone or with various GRKs using a heterologous expression system to investigate the potential role of the GRK pathway in the phosphorylation and desensitization of the dopamine D1A receptor as well as to examine the biochemical and biological specificity of various GRKs. Our results indicate that the agonist-occupied form of the D1A receptor can serve as a substrate for a variety of GRKs. Moreover, we show that receptor phosphorylation by specific members of the GRK family leads to distinct desensitization patterns of dopamine responsiveness.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression ConstructsThe dopamine rat D1A (rD1A) receptor was modified using oligo-directed mutagenesis to include the sequence for the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope recognized by a commercially available monoclonal antibody 12CA5(23.Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The nine-residue sequence of the epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted after Ala2, and this residue was repeated after the epitope to increase the distance between the epitope and the putative N-linked glycosylation site to avoid potential steric interference. A 67-mer oligonucleotide containing the epitope sequence as well as the 5′ regions of the rat D1A receptor was used to amplify a modified 5′ end of the gene, which was spliced to the wild-type receptor gene 3′ sequence using the internal BglII site. The sequence of the modified gene was verified by using dideoxy sequencing method (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and subcloned into the expression vector pCMV5. The HA-epitope tagged rat D1A receptor will be referred to as HA-rD1A receptor. The expression constructs for GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 were described previously(7.Arriza J.F. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Premont R. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase pCMV expression construct was purchased form Clonentech.Cell Culture and Plasmid TransfectionHuman embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10% (v/v)) and gentamicin (100 μg/ml) at 37° C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells seeded in 100-mm dishes (2.5 × 106 cells/dish) were transiently transfected by a modified calcium-phosphate method(25.Didsbury J.R. Uhing R.J. Tomhave E. Gerard C. Gerard N. Snyderman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11564-11568Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26.Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with cells passaged 34-48 times.Radioligand Binding293 cells seeded in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5-10 μg of wild-type rD1A receptor or the HA-tagged receptor. Following transfection (18-24 h), cells were reseeded in 150-mm dishes and allowed to grow for an additional 32-48 h. Radioligand binding studies were performed on membranes expressing either the wild-type or HA-rD1A receptor as described previously(26.Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard.Photoaffinity Cross-linkingMembranes from 293 cells expressing either the β-galactosidase alone, wild-type, or HA-rD1A receptor were resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM KCl, 4.0 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 1.0 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml benzamidine, leupeptine, and soybean trypsin inhibitor; 5 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). Photoaffinity cross-linking was performed using SCH39111(27.Gingrich J.A. Amlaiky N. Senogles S.E. Chang W.K. McQuade R.D. Berger J.G. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which was radioiodinated by procedures described by Amlaiky et al.(28.Amlaiky N. Berger J.G. Chang W. McQuade R.J. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 129-134PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes (20 μg of proteins) were incubated with 125I-SCH39111 (3.0 nM) in the presence or absence of 10 μM flupentixol in a final volume of 200 μl at 25° C for 90 min. At the end of the incubation, membranes were washed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min) 3 times with ice-cold 10 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.4), and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. Under dark conditions, 10 μl of 2 mM SANPAH (freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) were added to each sample, reacted for 15 min at 25°C, and stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 1 M glycine. The reaction mixture was photolysed as described previously(29.Amlaiky N. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1983-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation and solubilized in 60 μl of sample buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 8% (v/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol). Photoaffinity cross-linking of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels. Bands were visualized by autoradiography using Biomax films (Eastman Kodak Co.).Biotinylation293 cells transfected with 10 μg of β-galactosidase, or HA-rD1A receptor were reseeded in 6-well dishes. Confluent cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.65) with 1 mg/ml of Biotin-XX, succinimidyl ester probe (dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide) for 15 min at 37° C. At the end of the incubation, dishes were put on ice, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and processed as described by Freedman et al.(30.Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized by adding 0.5 ml of RIPA+ buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 10 mM disodium pyrophosphate) containing protease inhibitors (as described above). Solubilized cell extracts were transferred to 1.5-ml conical tubes in a total volume of 0.8 ml, and solubilized for an additional hour at 4° C using an inversion wheel. Supernatant fractions were collected by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 15 min at 4° C in TLA centrifuge 100.2 rotor (Beckman), and 730 μl of solubilized preparations were transferred to new tubes. Two aliquots (15 μl) were taken for protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit). Supernatant fractions (∽700 μl) were precleared by adding 100 μl of 10% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and rotated for 1 h at 4° C, and transferred to new tubes containing 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and 20 μg of purified monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Babco). After 2 h of incubation at 4° C, beads were pelleted, and the supernatant discarded. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of RIPA+ buffer and dried by aspiration using a 28-gauge needle (30.Freedman N.J. Liggett S.B. Drachman D.E. Pei G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17953-17961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Finally, 60 μl of sample buffer was added to each tube, and immunocomplexes were dissociated at 25° C overnight. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Bio-Rad) and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Corp.), and chemiluminescence of immunocomplexes was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.).Whole Cell Phosphorylation293 cells were transfected with a total of 15 μg of DNA. For control, GRK2, or GRK3 experimental conditions, 293 cells were cotransfected with 2.5 μg of HA-rD1A receptor expression construct and 12.5 μg of β-galactosidase (control), GRK2, or GRK3 expression construct. In the case of GRK5 experimental conditions, 293 cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of HA-rD1A receptor expression construct and 10 μg of GRK5 expression construct. Under these different experimental conditions, the expression levels for the HA-rD1A receptor were similar. A day prior to the assay, transfected cells were reseeded in 6-well dishes with 1-1.5 × 106 cells/well and grown for an additional 18 h. Cells were labeled for 90 min at 37° C, in 20 mM HEPES-buffered phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.4), and gentamicin containing 0.2 mCi/ml of 32Pi. At the end of the labeling period, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μM dopamine. Solubilization and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described above. Phosphorylated receptors were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels. Gel lanes were loaded with volumes giving equivalent amounts of HA-rD1A receptor as assessed by ligand binding. Gels were dried and exposed to Biomax film at room temperature for 4-24 h. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).ImmunoblottingTransfected 293 cells reseeded in 6-well dishes (see above) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), containing protease inhibitors, and homogeneized with a plastic pestle. 20 μg of proteins from total cell extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels. Moreover, 5 μg of proteins from total Sf9 cell extract overexpressing GRK2, GRK3, or GRK5 were used as positive controls. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of either GRK2/GRK3 or GRK5 polyclonal antibodies(7.Arriza J.F. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the chemiluminescence of immunocomplexes was detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.).Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisPhosphoamino acid analysis was performed with gel used for whole cell phosphorylation experiments. Phosphorylated protein bands were identified by lining up the autoradiogram with the gel. The bands were excised from the gel, eluted in 50 mM NH4HCO3, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, precipitated 1 h on ice, and hydrolyzed in 50 μl of 6 N HCl for 1 h at 110° C as described previously(31.Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin layer cellulose plates (Eastman Kodak Co.). The first dimension was carried out in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% (v/v) formic acid, 1.38 M glacial acetic acid), and plates were run for 1.5 h at 900 V. The second dimension was carried out in pH 3.5 buffer (0.5% (v/v) pyridine, 0.87 M glacial acetic acid), and plates were run for 45 min at 900 V. Finally, thin layer cellulose plates were air-dried, stained with 1% (v/v) ninhydrin to visualize phosphoamino acid standards, and exposed on Biomax film for 48 h at −80° C.cAMP Accumulation AssayFollowing transfection (18-24 h), 293 cells were reseeded in 6-well dishes (wild-type versus HA time course experiments) or 12-well dishes (GRK experiments). The next day, culture medium was replaced by fresh minimum essential medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, gentamicin, and labeled with [3H]adenine (1.5 μCi/ml) for 18-22 h. Determinations of intracellular cAMP were assessed by incubating cells in 10 mM HEPES-buffered minimum essential medium (with no phosphodiesterase inhibitors) in the absence or presence of dopamine at 37° C for various periods of time(26.Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by transferring dishes on ice, aspirating the medium, and adding 1 ml of stop solution (2.5% (v/v) perchloric acid, 100 μM cAMP, and ∽10,000 cpm of [14C]cAMP). After 20-30 min in the cold, the acid-cell lysates were transferred to tubes containing 0.1 ml of neutralizing solution (4.2 M KOH). The salt precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and separation of [3H]cAMP in the cell lysate supernatants was done using a sequential chromatography on Dowex and alumina columns. Data are presented as 1000 times the ratio [3H]cAMP formed over the total uptake measured in the well.Data AnalysisRadioligand binding and dose-response curves were analyzed using the curve-fitting programs ALLFIT and LIGAND(32.DeLéan A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7760) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of data were performed using analysis of variance. Pairwise comparisons were assessed either by the t distribution test or GT2-method(34.Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1981Google Scholar). Homogeneity of variances was assessed by the Fmax test. The level of significance was established at 5% using one-tailed test. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E.MaterialsHuman embryonic kidney cells (293) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (CRL 1573). Tissue culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Adenine, [14C]cAMP, and 32Pi were purchased from DuPont NEN. Dopamine-HCl and flupentixol-HCl were from Research Biochemical International. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma. Nonidet P-40 was purchased from Calbiochem. SANPAH was purchased from Pierce. Biotin-XX succinimidyl ester probe was procured from Molecular Probes. SCH39111 was obtained from Schering-Plough Corp.RESULTSMolecular and Biochemical Characterization of the Hemagglutinin Epitope-tagged Dopamine D1A ReceptorUsing polymerase chain reaction-based methodology, we have engineered the sequence coding for the hemagglutinin epitope (HA) in the amino terminus of the rat dopamine D1A (rD1A) receptor. To verify that the receptor function was not impaired by the insertion of the epitope, we characterize the binding and coupling properties of the HA-rD1A receptor. Saturation studies revealed that equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the antagonist 125I-SCH23982 for 293 cells expressing either the wild-type or the HA-rD1A receptor was similar (0.51 ± 0.03 nMversus 0.46 ± 0.05 nM, respectively). We subsequently investigated the binding properties of agonists and antagonists. The affinity constants (Ka) of the agonist dopamine and the antagonist were identical at both the wild-type or HA-tagged receptor (data not shown). These results suggest that insertion of HA in the amino terminus does not affect the binding properties of agonists and antagonists displayed at the wild-type rD1A receptor.The rD1A receptor has been shown to be coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase when expressed in 293 cells(26.Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the coupling properties of the HA-rD1A receptor, dose-response curves to dopamine were performed at different time points (2, 5, and 10 min) using a whole cell cAMP assay in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. The wild-type or HA-rD1A receptor display similar dose-response curves to dopamine at all time points investigated (Fig. 1). Over the time course studied, at similar receptor expression levels for both forms of the receptor, the maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase (Vmax) increased to similar extent, while the basal activity was not statistically different. As depicted in Fig. 1, the effective concentration (EC50) measured for the HA-rD1A receptor was not statistically different from the wild-type receptor (∽15 nM).To determine the apparent molecular weight of the HA-rD1A receptor protein expressed in 293 cells, we performed photoaffinity cross-linking experiments using 125I-SCH39111(27.Gingrich J.A. Amlaiky N. Senogles S.E. Chang W.K. McQuade R.D. Berger J.G. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the HA-rD1A receptor is expressed at the plasma membrane of 293 cells as a broad protein band of about 80 kDa, an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the wild-type rD1A receptor. These results suggest that insertion of the epitope in the amino terminus does not interfere with the glycosylation of the D1A receptor. This photoaffinity labeling was specific to the expression of the wild-type or tagged receptor, since no detectable labeling was observed in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). The post-translational modification of the human homologue of the D1A receptor expressed in 293 cells was identical to its rat counterpart (data not shown).Figure 2:Photoaffinity cross-linking and biotinylation of the HA-rD1A receptor expressed transiently in 293 cells. A, photoaffinity cross-linking experiments were performed in membranes prepared from 293 cells transfected with β-galactosidase alone (MOCK), HA-tagged rD1A (HA-rD1A) or wild-type receptor (WT-rD1A).

https://openalex.org/W2071941416,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unsaturated fatty acids are formed from saturated acyl-CoA precursors by Ole1p, a Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase. OLE1 mRNA levels are differentially regulated by the addition of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids to the growth medium. One component of this regulation system involves the control of OLE1 transcription. Saturated fatty acids induce a 1.6-fold increase in transcription activity, whereas a large family of unsaturated fatty acids repress OLE1 transcription as much as 60-fold. A deletion analysis of OLE1 promoter::lacZ fusion reporter genes identified a 111-base pair (bp) fatty acid-regulated (FAR) region approximately 580 bp upstream of the start codon that is essential for transcription activation and unsaturated fatty acid repression. Deletion of an 88-bp sequence within that region resulted in a complete loss in transcription activation and unsaturated fatty acid regulation. The 111-bp FAR element strongly activates transcription and confers unsaturated fatty acid regulation on a heterologous CYC1 promoter test plasmid. Essential elements required for unsaturated fatty acid repression of OLE1 were found in the 5′ and 3′ region of the 111-bp sequence. The FAR element-mediated activation and fatty acid repression of transcription was found to be closely tied to fatty acyl-CoA metabolism. Two fatty acid activation genes, FAA1 and FAA4, were found to be essential for unsaturated fatty acid repression of OLE1 through the FAR sequences. Disruption of either gene results in reduced levels of unsaturated fatty acid repression; disruption of both genes completely blocks the regulatory response. Acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) plays a role in determining the level of FAR element activated transcription. Disruption of the ACBP gene causes a >5-fold activation of OLE1 transcription and a similar increase in OLE1 mRNA levels. Unsaturated fatty acid repression of OLE1 transcription, however, is not affected by the disrupted ACBP gene. These studies show that promoter elements responsible for unsaturated fatty acid-mediated transcription repression are tightly linked to OLE1 activation sequences and that OLE1 transcription levels are closely tied to acyl-CoA metabolism.

INTRODUCTIONNutrient fatty acids can exert strong regulatory effects on a number of lipogenic enzymes in fungi. Medium and long chain fatty acids are readily internalized by fungi and incorporated into membrane and storage lipids. Saturated and unsaturated acids appear to differentially regulate the expression of a number of lipid biosynthetic genes, including those encoding acetyl-CoA carboxylase (2.Kamiryo T. Parthasarathy S. Numa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3.Numa S. Tanabe T. Numa S. Fatty Acid Metabolism and Its Regulation.

A. 1992; 89: 10232-10236Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6.Schuller H.-J. Schutz A. Knab S. Hoffman B. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and fatty acid desaturase(1.Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which cells sense fatty acids, discriminate among molecular species, and modulate gene activity in different parts of the lipid metabolic web is unclear, although it appears that multiple systems have evolved to regulate different lipogenic functions.To identify the mechanisms that control lipid synthesis in response to extracellular acids, we examined the regulation of the Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase, an enzyme involved in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids. The OLE1 gene, which encodes that enzyme in Saccharomyces, is strongly regulated in response to extracellular fatty acids(1.Bossie M.A. Martin C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6409-6413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This can be seen as a rapid reduction in OLE1 mRNA levels when unsaturated acids are added to the growth medium and an increase in enzyme activity when cells are exposed to saturated fatty acids. The exogenous fatty acids that trigger these responses are rapidly incorporated into membrane lipids; thus it is reasonable to expect that the sensors and signal transducers that regulate OLE1 in response to nutrient fatty acids may also be a part of broader controls that regulate membrane lipid composition in response to other stimuli.Our recent studies suggest that fatty acid regulation of OLE1 is under at least two forms of control(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One component acts to repress transcription of the OLE1 gene; a second acts by post-transcriptional mechanisms to further modify OLE1 mRNA levels(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine the promoter of the desaturase gene to identify transcriptional controlling elements that respond to unsaturated fatty acids and to assess their contribution to OLE1 expression. An essential transcription activation region, designated the FAR ( 1The abbreviations used are: FAR fatty acid-regulated UDt uracil drop-out synthetic medium with tergitol bp base pair(s) PCR polymerase chain reaction kb kilobase(s) ACBP acyl-CoA binding protein FAA S. cerevisiae fatty acid activation gene (acyl-CoA synthetase) ER endoplasmic reticulum.) element, is identified that also contains the elements required for unsaturated fatty acid-mediated repression of transcription activity. There appears to be a close connection between cellular acyl-CoA metabolism and regulators that act on that region of the OLE1 promoter.MATERIALS AND METHODSStrains, Growth Medium, and DNA ManipulationsStrains used in this study are shown in Table 1. Yeast cells containing lacZ fusion plasmids were grown at 30°C on uracil dropout synthetic dextrose (8.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar) medium supplemented with 1% tergitol (UDt) and 1 mM appropriate fatty acid (obtained from Sigma or Nu-Chek Prep). All unsaturated fatty acids used in this paper contained double bonds in the cis configuration. All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods(8.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar, 9.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid amplifications and bacterial transformations were performed using Escherichia coli strains HB101, DH5α(Life Technologies, Inc.), or XL1-Blue (Stratagene). Yeast transformations were performed by the method of Ito et al.(10.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by electroporation (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Construction of OLE1 Promoter:lacZ Fusion Deletion SeriesPlasmids used in this study are shown in Table 2. Plasmid p62 was constructed by exchanging a HindIII/StuI fragment from plasmid YCp50 (11.Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) with a DNA fragment from plasmid YEP356R(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a multiple cloning sequence fused to the protein coding region of the E. coli lacZ gene. Plasmid p62::-934 was constructed by the insertion of an OLE1 1015-bp HindIII/SalI fragment into the p62 multiple cloning site. That fragment extends from −934 base pairs upstream of the start codon through codon 27 of the OLE1 protein region to form an in-frame fusion with the E. coli lacZ sequence. A nested series of OLE1 promoter deletions were derived from that vector; these cover the region from nucleotides −934 to −142 relative to the first in-frame ATG codon. They were constructed using a combination of available restriction sites and Bal31 digestions. All Bal31-generated end points were determined by DNA sequencing.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasmid p62::-934Δ88 was constructed by isolating a fragment consisting of OLE1 nucleotides −934 to −576 and fusing it to a fragment containing bases −489 to +81. The resulting fragment was ligated into the parent p62 plasmid, yielding an OLE1 insert with the same ends as p62::-934 but lacking 88 bases between −576 and −489. All fragments in plasmid p62 series had a 3′-end point at nucleotide +81. The promoter deletion constructs were used to transform the phenotypically wild-type OLE1 strain, L8-25A, to uracil prototrophy.Construction of pCTΔ Vectors Containing OLE1 Promoter SequencesPlasmids derived from vector pCTΔ are shown in Table 2. Promoter test vector pCTΔ was obtained from Kornberg(12.Buchman A.R. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5086-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20.Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It contains a multiple cloning site fused to bases −248 through +5 of the Saccharomyces CYC1 promoter region, which is fused in-frame to E. coli lacZ. The CYC1 fragment includes two functional TATA elements, but it does not contain the CYC1 upstream activating sequences. During the course of this study, a sequence of bases encoding the KpnI-SmaI restriction sites in the multiple cloning region of the vector was found to be a transcription-repressing element that acted independent of the inserted test sequences. Vectors in which that site was removed by restriction enzyme digestion of flanking sequences were designated as pCTm (pCT modified) vectors.Vectors pCT714 and pCTm714 were constructed by inserting a 714-bp HindIII/HpaI fragment that extended between bases −934 and −221 of the OLE1 promoter into the pCTΔ multiple cloning region. Vectors pCT111 and pCTm111 were similarly constructed by inserting 111 bp of the OLE1 promoter region that extends from bases −576 to −466. Vector pCTm111E10 was made by inserting an EcoRI linker (sequence CCGAATTCGG) into the SmaI restriction site at the 5′-end of the 111-bp fragment of pCTm111. pCTm100 was derived from pCTm111E10 by EcoRI digestion to remove the 11 upstream base pairs of the OLE1 promoter sequence.Vectors pCTm67 and pCTm40 were constructed using synthetic paired oligonucleotides. Vector pCTm67 contains bases −582 to −516, and plasmid pCTm40 includes bases −582 and −543 of the OLE1 promoter sequences.Vector pCTm91 was constructed using a 91-bp fragment encompassing bases −556 to −466 of the OLE1 promoter (derived by PCR amplification of OLE1 promoter sequences). The base sequence of the PCR fragment was determined by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pCTm114 contains bases −579 to −466 of the OLE1 promoter. Vector pCTm25 was prepared by digestion of vector pCTm114 at the ApaI restriction site within the 114-bp OLE1 sequence and the vector XhoI site.Integrating vectors pITm714 and pITm111 were constructed by removing the ARS and CEN sequences from their respective pCTm parents by HindIII digestion and religation.β-Galactosidase AssaysAssays of cells containing plasmids derived from OLE1 promoter-lacZ fusion p62 constructs were performed as described previously(8.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). Cell densities for those assays were determined either by measurement at A600 or by hemocytometer counts. Corrections were made for light scattering by A550 absorption. Assays of extracts from cells containing pCT plasmids were assayed by the procedure of Buchman et al.(12.Buchman A.R. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5086-5099Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The latter assays were correlated with total protein in cell extracts by the method of Bradford (13.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad assay kit. Two or three independent yeast transformants were assayed for each of the plasmid constructs given in Table 2. β-Galactosidase activities reported here are the results of at least three independent experiments. Each experimental assay was performed in triplicate.Fatty Acid Repression/Derepression StudiesCells containing an OLE1-lacZ reporter gene were tested for unsaturated fatty acid regulation according to protocols that measure repression of activity from a derepressed state. Cells were grown overnight in uracil dropout synthetic dextrose medium supplemented with 1% UDt. These cultures were used to inoculate (at one-tenth total volume) fresh UDt medium or UDt medium supplemented with 0.5 mM each of the unsaturated fatty acids (16:1 and 18:1) or 1 mM of 18:2. These cultures were incubated at 30°C with rotary shaking for 8-10 h followed by harvesting by centrifugation for analysis of β-galactosidase activity.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal yeast RNA was isolated essentially as described previously(14.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 15.Herrick D. Parker R. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2269-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (10 μg) of total RNA from each time point of an experiment were analyzed by Northern blots according to standard procedures for separation of RNA using 1% formaldehyde gels(8.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar). RNA from the gels was transferred to the Zeta Probe(™) membrane (Bio-Rad) in 10 × SSC for 90 min at 5 inches of mercury using a Vacuum Blotter (model 785) from Bio-Rad, according to instructions from the manufacturer. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of membranes were performed as described in the Zeta Probe(™) manual. A hybridization oven (Hybaid Mini Oven MK II) was used as described in the instruction manual supplied by the manufacturer. The membrane was prehybridized at 65°C for 10-20 min in 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS. The membrane was hybridized at 65°C overnight with 2.5 × 106 cpm/ml. Following incubation the membrane was washed twice (30 min/wash) at 65°C with 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 5% SDS. This was followed by two 30-60-min wash cycles at 65°C with 1 mM EDTA, 40 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS. Northern blots were quantified using a phosphorimaging analyzer (Molecular Dynamics).Preparation of Radiolabeled ProbesFor the detection of OLE1 mRNA, a radiolabeled DNA probe was made using a 0.5-kb EcoRI fragment from the OLE1 protein coding sequence. For an internal control of cellular mRNA levels, a 1-kb HindIII-KpnI fragment of the Saccharomyces phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK1) was isolated from plasmid pRIP1PGK obtained from S. Peltz (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). All DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE and purified by Gene Clean II (Bio 101) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The purified DNA fragments were labeled to high specific activity with [α-32P]dATP (DuPont NEN) by the random primer extension method (16.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar) using a PROBE-EZE reaction kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the sample using a Sephadex G-50 spin column (5 Prime → 3 Prime). Specific activity of labeled probes was determined by liquid scintillation counting.Fatty Acid Extraction and AnalysisTotal cellular fatty acids were obtained by HCl methanolysis of extensively washed cell pellets according to the modified procedure of Browse et al. (17.Browse J. McCourt P. Somerville C.R. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 859-864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid fractionation and preparation of fatty acid methyl ester chromatography were performed as described previously(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were separated on a Supelcowax 10 30 m × 0.032 mm capillary column using helium as a carrier gas in a Varian 3400CX gas chromatograph.Cloning and Disruption of ACBPA 1.6-kb DNA fragment encoding the S. cerevisiae acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) gene was cloned by PCR amplification of genomic DNA. PCR primers used for the amplification were 5′-TTCCACATGTGAAATTATGCTGG-3′ (bases −853 to −831 of ACBP gene, where +1 is the A in the ATG start codon) and 5′-GTGTACTGTACCACTAGTTTGG-3′ (positions +728 to +749). This fragment was cloned into PCR-script SK(+) (Stratagene). A 700-bp fragment containing the ACBP protein coding region and flanking vector 5′ and 3′ sequences were removed by BglII/BclI digestion. This was replaced with a 2-kb fragment consisting of the Saccharomyces LEU2 gene. A 2.8-kb linear DNA fragment encompassing the LEU2 gene and flanking ACBP gene sequences was isolated from the plasmid and used to perform a one-step gene disruption (18.Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 19.Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) of the chromosomal ACBP gene in strain DTY-10A. The disruption of ACBP was confirmed by leucine prototrophy and PCR analysis of genomic DNA.RESULTSDeletion Analysis of OLE1 Promoter::lacZ Fusion VectorsDNA fragments from the OLE1 promoter consisting of a nested series of 5′ deletions (starting from base −934 relative to the start codon) were placed in frame with β-galactosidase coding sequences in the single copy CEN plasmid (p62) and transformed into a phenotypically wild-type (OLE1+) strain L8-25A for analysis. β-Galactosidase activities for the reporter genes are shown in Fig. 1.Deletion of bases −934 to −576 caused an approximate 3-fold loss of reporter gene activity. Removing bases −576 through −488 caused a further 20-fold drop in reporter gene activity, indicating the presence of an activating sequence in the region near base −576. Deletions producing 5′ ends between −396 and −255 exhibited small (2-fold) increases in expression corresponding to approximately one-thirtieth of the activity seen with the entire 934-bp promoter fragment. Deletions beyond base −255 produced reporter gene activities near the basal level exhibited by the plasmid that contains no OLE1 promoter sequences. An 88-bp deletion in the putative activation region between bases −576 through −489 (Fig. 1) showed a 27-fold reduction in β-galactosidase activity, indicating that essential transcription activation elements were located in that region.Fatty Acid Regulation of the Promoter Deletion VectorsPrevious studies of a gene fusion containing the entire 934-bp promoter region fused to lacZ, indicated that reporter gene activity was strongly repressed by a set of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids(7.McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the position of potential unsaturated fatty acid regulation regions within the promoter, parallel cultures grown in the presence or absence of a mixture of 16:1 and 18:1 were assayed for β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1). These experiments were performed using standardized growth conditions that cause an 8-10-fold repression of reporter gene activity from the plasmid that contains the original 934-bp upstream OLE1 promoter region. Higher levels of repression (up to 60-fold reductions in activity) can be produced from the same construct by continuous feeding of unsaturated fatty acids. ( 2S. Hwang and C. Martin, unpublished observations.) Reporter plasmids containing deletions from −934 to −576 showed the full range of repression normally seen under these experimental conditions. Deletions downstream from base −576, however, lost the ability to be repressed concomitantly with the loss of transcription activation.The activity of the reporter containing the 88 bp deletion within the 934-bp fragment was reduced 2-fold in response to unsaturated fatty acids.Tests performed on the effects of saturated fatty acids on strains containing the promoter deletion series produced a different pattern of regulation (data not shown). Supplementation of media with 0.5 mM 14:0 produced a 1.2-1.5-fold increase in activities of cells that contained plasmids p62::-934 and p62::-792. By contrast, reporter activity of the plasmid p62::-576 was decreased 5-fold by the addition of 14:0. Activities of plasmids containing more extensive 5′ deletions in cells incubated with 14:0 did not differ significantly from those grown in media with no fatty acid supplements.A 111-bp FAR Element Contains the Primary Transcription Activation and Unsaturated Fatty Acid Regulatory Elements of OLE1Because sequence elements between −576 and −489 were found to be required for transcription activation and unsaturated fatty acid regulation, a series of OLE1 promoter fragments was tested for the ability to activate and confer unsaturated fatty acid repression on an unrelated gene. A CEN vector (designated vector pCT) that contains the basal promoter elements of the Saccharomyces CYC1 gene fused to lacZ(20.Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) was used for these tests. This vector lacks the CYC1 UAS sequences and produces low levels of reporter activity when activating sequences are absent from a multiple cloning site upstream of the basal promoter region. Vector pCT contains two TATA elements of the CYC1 gene; these have an arrangement similar to that found in elements in the OLE1 gene.Figure 2:Expression of reporter gene activity from heterologous pCT vectors containing OLE1 promoter sequences. Diagrams on the left compare the OLE1 promoter fragment in construct p62::-934, with OLE1 fragments inserted into heterologous constructions employing yeast CYC1:lacZ gene fusion plasmids. Plasmid pCT (20.Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) contains a polylinker upstream of the S. cerevisiae CYC1 promoter that lacks the CYC1 UAS sequence. Fragments of the OLE1 promoter were inserted into the polylinker region to test for the ability to activate transcription and confer fatty acid regulation on this test plasmid, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Plasmid pCT714 contains a 714-bp fragment extending from bases −934 to a HpaI site at position −221, which lies upstream of the OLE1 TATA sequences. OLE1 promoter sequences are indicated by the black line. The left-most box placed in the OLE1 promoter sequences indicates the position of the 111-bp FAR region shown to be essential for transcription activation and unsaturated fatty acid repression. Black bars represent CYC1 promoter sequences; hatched boxes indicate lacZ coding regions. Activities of heterologous promoter test plasmids are shown to the right of the corresponding figure and are expressed in nmol of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) hydrolyzed/min/mg protein. Activities indicated are the averages of at least three independent experiments ± S.D. for each vector.

Insertion of that fragment upstream of the CYC1 TATA region produced 66-fold higher levels of reporter gene activity, compared with the parent vector that contains no insert. Plasmid pCT714Δ88 contains the same 88-bp deletion as that in p62::-934Δ88. That vector showed only a 2-fold increase in activity above the basal levels produced by the parent plasmid.Reporter gene activity was also strongly activated in vector pCT111, which contains a 111-bp fragment derived from bases −576 to −466. The 5′-end of that fragment coincides with the 5′-end of the 88 bases deleted from the pCT714Δ88 vector that were found to be essential for transcription activation. Plasmid pCT111 exhibited a 28-fold increase in activity over the control plasmids that contained no OLE1 promoter sequences.Vectors that included either the 111-bp sequence or the intact 714-bp OLE1 promoter sequence were repressed by the addition of unsaturated fatty acids to the growth medium (Fig. 2). Vector pCT111 showed an approximate 2-fold repression of activity under conditions where the reporter that contained the entire promoter was repressed 7-fold. The vector containing the 88-bp deletion within the 714-bp promoter sequence was not repressed by unsaturated fatty acid regulation. These data suggest that primary elements essential for unsaturated fatty acid regulation are contained within the 111-bp promoter sequence. A parallel set of results was also obtained in tests of these fragments in the related pCZ plasmid(20.Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). That vector differs from the plasmid pCTΔ in that it contains a shorter part of the CYC1 basal promoter region that includes only one TATA sequence (data not shown). Given the ability of the 111-bp DNA fragment to strongly activate transcription and confer fatty acid-specific repression on heterologous vectors, it was designated as the OLE1 FAR sequence. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment and flanking sequences is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3:Nucleotide sequences associated with the FAR element responsible for transcription activation and unsaturated fatty acid regulation.

Recombinant adenoviruses deleted in E1 and containing a human OTC cDNA expressed little functional OTC enzyme in vivo and had no observable impact on the underlying metabolic abnormalities of the OTC-deficient mouse (i.e. elevated urinary orotate and serum glutamine). E1-deleted vectors were improved through the use of the strong constitutive promoter from cytomegalovirus driving the normal murine homolog of OTC cDNA and the ablation of E2a with a temperature-sensitive mutation. Infusion of this improved vector into the mouse model was associated with a complete normalization of liver OTC enzyme activity that persisted for at least 2 months with complete but transient correction in serum glutamine and urine orotic acid. These studies illustrate the utility of improved adenoviral vectors in the treatment of liver metabolic disease.

Although GM-CSF receptor is devoid of tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity, GM-CSF-induced peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) functional activation is mediated by the phosphorylation of a large number of intracellular signaling molecules. We have previously shown that JAK2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to GM-CSF in PMN. In the present study we demonstrate that also the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family members STAT1 p91 and STAT3 p92 and the product of the c-fps/fes protooncogene become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon GM-CSF stimulation and physically associated with both GM-CSF receptor β common subunit and JAK2. Moreover GM-CSF was able to induce JAK2 and p93fes catalytic activity. We also demonstrate that the association of the GM-CSF receptor β common subunit with JAK2 is ligand-dependent.Finally we demonstrate that GM-CSF induces a DNA-binding complex that contains both p91 and p92. These results identify a new signal transduction pathway activated by GM-CSF and provide a mechanism for rapid activation of gene expression in GM-CSF-stimulated PMN.

https://openalex.org/W2123938732,"The association of the murine motheaten phenotype of severe hemopoietic dysregulation with loss of PTP1C tyrosine phosphatase activity indicates a critical role for this SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase in the regulation of hemopoietic cell growth and differentiation. To explore the molecular basis for PTP1C effects on hematopoiesis, we have investigated the possibility that this enzyme interacts with the product of the Vav proto-oncogene, a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor expressed exclusively in hemopoietic cells. Our data indicate that PTP1C physically associates with Vav in murine spleen cells and in EL4 T lymphoma and P815 mastocytoma cells, and that this interaction is increased following mitogenic stimulation and the induction of both PTP1C and Vav tyrosine phosphorylation. The results also reveal tyrosine phosphatase activity to be present in Vav immunoprecipitates from stimulated splenic and P815 cells and suggest that a major portion of total cellular PTP1C catalytic activity is associated with Vav. As Vav-associated tyrosine phosphatase activity was not detected in PTP1C-deficient motheaten splenic cells, it appears that PTP1C accounts for most, if not all, Vav-coprecipitable tyrosine phosphatase activity in normal cells. The data also demonstrate the capacity of the Vav SH2 domain alone to bind to PTP1C in activated P815 cells, but suggest a role for the two Vav SH3 domains in enhancing this interaction. In addition, the results reveal PTP1C association with two other molecules implicated in Ras activation, the Grb2 adaptor protein and mSos1, a GTP/GDP exchanger for Ras. PTP1C therefore has the capacity to bind and potentially modulate various signaling effectors involved in activation of Ras or Ras-related proteins, and, accordingly, regulation of Ras activation represents a possible mechanism whereby PTP1C influences hemopoietic cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2046573194,"DREF, a transcription regulatory factor which specifically binds to the promoter-activating element DRE (DNA replication-related element) of DNA replication-related genes, was purified to homogeneity from nuclear extracts of Drosophila Kc cells. cDNA for DREF was isolated with the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method using primers synthesized on the basis of partial amino acid sequences and following screening of cDNA libraries. Deduced from the nucleotide sequences of cDNA, DREF is a polypeptide of 701 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 80,096, which contains three characteristic regions, rich in basic amino acids, proline, and acidic amino acids, respectively. Deletion analysis of bacterially expressed DREF fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST-DREF) indicated that a part of the N-terminal basic amino acid region (16-115 amino acids) is responsible for the specific binding to DRE. A polyclonal and four monoclonal antibodies were raised against the GST-DREF fusion protein. The antibodies inhibited specifically the transcription of DNA polymerase α promoter in vitro. Cotransfection experiments using Kc cells demonstrated that overproduction of DREF protein overcomes the repression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen gene promoter by the zerknüllt gene product. These results confirmed that DREF is a trans-activating factor for DNA replication-related genes. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of DREF polypeptide in nuclei after the eighth nuclear division cycle, suggesting that nuclear accumulation of DREF is important for the coordinate zygotic expression of DNA replication-related genes carrying DRE sequences.

A number of enzymes involved in DNA replication have been suggested to form an enzyme complex for this purpose(1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman Co., New York1992: 471-510Google Scholar). Genes for these enzymes are expressed in proliferating cells and repressed in quiescent cells reaching confluency or in association with cellular differentiation(2.Matsukage A. Kitani H. Yamaguchi M. Kusakabe M. Morita T. Koshida Y. Dev. Biol. 1986; 117: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of interest to clarify the genetic mechanisms governing the coordinate induction or repression of DNA replication-related genes in relation to growth or differentiation signals. In budding yeast, the MluI cell cycle box and the specific binding factor, DSC-1, are responsible for cell cycle-dependent transcription of a number of DNA replication-related genes(3.Lowndes N.F.

The critical promoter regions of DNA polymerase α, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and thymidine kinase genes contain binding sites for the E2F family (11.Pearson B.E. Nasheuer H.P. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2081-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kim Y.K. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2296-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13.Blake M. Azizkham J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the promoter of the DHFR gene has provided strong evidence that the E2F element is responsible for the promoter activation in late G1(14.Means A.L. Slansky J.E. McMahon S.L. Knuth M.W. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the E2F-binding site was shown to be involved in activation of the DHFR and thymidine kinase genes following serum stimulation(15.Slansky J.E. Li Y. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16.Li R. Naeve G.S. Lee A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3554-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fact that the active form of E2F accumulates in late G1 toward the S phase (17.Farnham P.J. Slansky J.E. Kollmar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18.Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 19.Hsiao K.-M. McMahon S.L. Farnham P.J. Genes & Dev. 1994.; 8: 1526-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) provides further evidence that E2F family members are likely candidates for involvement in transcriptional regulation of specific G1/S-phase-activated genes that are required for DNA replication. The E2F binding sites of the Drosophila genes for DNA polymerase α and PCNA are also important for their proliferation-related expression(20.Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Yamaguchi M. Hayashi Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol.

However, little is known about regulation mechanisms of DNA replication-related genes during the transition from G0 into the cell cycle or the transition from proliferating to quiescent states. We have analyzed upstream regulatory regions of Drosophila genes for the DNA polymerase α 180-kDa catalytic subunit (22.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Masutani M. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the PCNA(23.Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Moriuchi T. Hirose F. Hui C.-C. Suzuki Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and found a novel transcription regulatory sequence consisting of an 8-bp palindromic sequence (5′-TATCGATA), called DRE (DNA replication-related element) and a specific binding factor, DREF (DRE-binding factor)(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three DREs and one DRE are present in the DNA polymerase α and PCNA genes, respectively. Transient CAT expression and gel mobility shift assay using cultured Kc cells indicated that DRE stimulates the promoter activities and that DREF can bind specifically to DRE(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another aspect is that promoters of Drosophila DNA replication-related genes are repressed by the product of the zerknüllt (zen) gene, a homeobox gene which regulates the differentiation of the optic lobe and the amnioserosa in the dorsal region of the Drosophila embryo(25.Rushlow C. Doyle H. Hoey T. Levine M. Nature. 1987; 330: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26.Foe V.E. Development. 1989; 107: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Campos-Ortega J.A. Hartenstein V. The Embryonic Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985Crossref Google Scholar) . Repression of promoter activities by Zen protein has been observed not only in cultured Kc cells but also in transgenic flies carrying the PCNA gene promoter-directed lacZ gene(28.Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishida Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4909-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2937-2942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . Recently we obtained evidence indicating that overexpression of Zen protein results in reduction of DREF activities in the cell(29.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2937-2942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) . Therefore, DREF may be one of the key transcription regulatory factors involved in proliferation- and differentiation-related control of DNA replication genes. We earlier purified DREF as a homodimer of an approximately 86-kDa polypeptide to near homogeneity(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolated cDNA for DREF and demonstrated the involvement of DREF in the high level of expression of DNA replication-related genes with DRE sequences. Kc cells derived from Drosophila early embryos were grown in spinner culture at 25°C using M3(BF) medium (30.Cross D.P. Sang J.H. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1978; . 45: 161-172PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5% CO2. The DREF polypeptide was purified using DRE oligonucleotide-conjugated latex particles and gel filtration column chromatography as described earlier(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was then concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon, Inc.) and precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitated DREF polypeptide (20 μg) was washed with ice-cold acetone, dissolved in sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, boiled for 1 min, separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoretically blotted onto a sheet of Glassybond paper. Membrane-bound protein was subjected to in situ proteolytic cleavage using endopeptidase Lyso-C (Wako) in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 at 37°C for 24 h. The resulting oligopeptide mixture was separated with an HPLC apparatus equipped with a reverse-phase C4 column. Oligopeptide-containing fractions were collected manually into Eppendorf tubes. When necessary, each of the peak fractions was further purified with rechromatography on a reverse-phase C18 column. Samples were stored at −70°C before analysis. Each sample was adsorbed to a disc of Glassybond, and the amino acid sequence was analyzed with an Applied Biosystems model 470A automated gas-phase protein sequencer. All oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. Degenerate primers for reverse transcriptase-PCR were synthesized depending on the partial amino acid sequences of DREF. The synthesized oligonucleotides sequences were as follows: I, 5′-TT(C/T)GA(C/T)CIAA(T/C)GA(A/G)ATICCIAA(T/C)CC; II, 5′-TT(C/T)GA(C/T)AG(C/T)AA(T/C)GA(A/G)ATICCIAA(T/C)CC; III, 5′-AA(A/G)TA(T/C)GA(A/G)GA(T/C)GTITCICA(A/G)(T/C)T; IV, 5′-AA(A/G)TA(T/C)GA(A/G)GA(T/C)GTIAG(T/C)CA(A/G)(T/C)T; V, 5′-TA(T/C)TGG(C/A)GITA(T/C)TT(T/C)GGITT(T/C)CC; five more oligonucleotides with complementary sequences to I-V were also synthesized (IR, IIR, IIIR, IVR, and VR). To amplify a sequence containing a complete open reading frame, a set of PCR primers with a BamHI site was synthesized: 5′-specific oligonucleotide, 5′-ACAGGATCCAAGATGAGCGAAGGGGTACCA, and 3′-specific oligonucleotide, 5′-ATCCTAATTGTTGTGATGATGCT, where sequences with underlining indicate the BamHI site, translation initiation codon, and stop codon of the DREF cDNA, in that order. Poly(A) tail-containing RNA was isolated using an mRNA separater kit (Clontech) from Kc cell total RNA. Poly(A)-RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 37°C using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (1 unit) (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT)12−18 (0.5 μg) as a primer in a solution (50 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 40 mM KCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The products were ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 0.3 M ammonium acetate (pH 7.0), washed with 80% ethanol, and redissolved in 50 μl of Tris-EDTA. Aliquots (5 μl) were used to amplify DREF cDNA using Taq DNA polymerase (5 units) in a solution (50 μl) containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 100 μM of the pair of PCR primers with the sequences detailed above. cDNA products were generated by 30 cycles of PCR (1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C and 2 min at 72°C), separated on a 1% agarose gel, and recovered from the gel by the DE-81 method(33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.24-6.27Google Scholar). Obtained DNA fragments were cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript II SK(-) (pDCDREF1.8) and sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method(34.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA clones for DREF were isolated by screening two kinds of λgt10 cDNA libraries constructed from mRNAs obtained from 0-3-h-old and 3-12-h-old Drosophila embryos under high stringency conditions using a 32P-labeled 1.8-kb cDNA fragment excised from pDCDREF1.8 as a probe. The obtained cDNA clones (2.7 kb) had a single EcoRI site and, therefore, two EcoRI fragments of 1.0 and 1.7 kb were excised from λgt10 DNA. Each EcoRI fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK(-) (pDCDREF1.0 and pDCDREF1.7) and sequenced. A cDNA containing a complete open reading frame without 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences was obtained with 30 cycles of PCR (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C) using 10 ng of DNA of λgt10 clone carrying full-length cDNA as a template and 5′- and 3′-specific oligonucleotides as primers. The resultant DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and subcloned into BamHI-SmaI sites of pBluescript II SK(-) (pDCDREF2.2). To construct deletion mutant GST-DREF expressing plasmids, 27 mer PCR primers were synthesized. All primers for coding and complementary strands were designed to contain BamHI and EcoRI sites, respectively. We produced recombinant DREF fused to GST. A construct containing the full-length DREF (amino acids 1-701; pGST-DREF1-701) was created by inserting a 2.2-kb cDNA fragment from pDCDREF2.2 with BamHI and EcoRV into BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX-2T. A construct containing amino acid residues 16-608 (pGST-DREF16-608) was obtained by excising a 1.8-kb cDNA fragment from pDCDREF1.8 with EcoRV and BamHI, filling the protruding-end with Klenow fragment and inserting it into the SmaI site of pGEX-3X. This expression plasmid was used for large scale preparation of the DREF polypeptide, which was then applied as an antigen to raise antibodies. Extraction and purification of recombinant protein were carried out as described previously(35.Date T. Yamaguchi M. Hirose F. Nishimoto Y. Tanihara K. Matsukage A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2983-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Constructs containing the N-terminal basic region (amino acids 16-242; pGST-DREF16-242) and C-terminal acidic region (amino acid 240-608; pGST-DREF240-608) were prepared by partially digesting pGST-DREF16-608 with EcoRI and religating the plasmid DNA with T4 DNA ligase. cDNAs of the other GST-DREF mutants (see Fig. 2) were amplified by PCR with EcoRI-BamHI sites and inserted into pGEX-2T. All constructs were sequenced. DREF-fusion proteins were produced in E. coli essentially as described earlier(36.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Lysates of cells were prepared by sonication in buffer D containing 0.6 M KCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and used for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel mobility shift assay, or footprinting. Preparation of nuclear extracts from Kc cells and conditions of gel mobility shift assay were as described elsewhere(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for o-phenanthroline-copper footprinting was prepared as described earlier(37.Kuwabara M. Sigman D.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7234-7238Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment excised from plasmid pHP3 (−292 to +45 region of the DNA polymerase α gene) (24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was labeled at the 5′-end of either the upper or the lower strand using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [32P]ATP. The probe (1 ng, 5 × 104 cpm) was incubated with an extract (1 μg of protein) of E. coli producing GST-DREF16-242 in 30 μl of solution containing 15 mM Hepes (pH7.6), 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA on ice for 20 min. The resulting complexes were resolved on a 3% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, one of the glass plates was removed. The gel attached to the other glass plate was transferred to a glass dish containing 200 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and equilibrated for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 20 ml of 0.9 mM CuSO4, 4 mM 1,10-phenanthroline solution were added to the equilibrated gel. The cleavage reaction was initiated by adding 20 ml of 0.5% 3-mercaptopropionic acid, allowed to proceed for 1 min at room temperature, and stopped by adding 10 ml of 1.2% 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline. The gel was rinsed twice with distilled water and exposed to x-ray film for 4 h at 4°C. Portions of gel containing DNA-protein complexes or free DNA probe were excised and incubated in 500 μl of DNA elution buffer containing 1% SDS, 0.2 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, and 1 mg/ml tRNA overnight at 37°C to elute the DNA. The elution buffer was removed from the gel fragment and extracted once with phenol/chloroform, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was then dissolved in formamide-loading dye solution and resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in parallel with products of Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions (38.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (5478) Google Scholar) using the same DNA used as a probe for sequencing controls. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed. Rabbit antiserum and mouse monoclonal antibodies against DREF polypeptide were raised against the bacterially produced recombinant DREF consisting of 16-608 amino acids fused with GST. Monoclonal antibodies were screened by enzyme-linked immunoassay using the recombinant GST-DREF polypeptide. If necessary, each of monoclonal antibodies was purified from culture medium of hybridomas using E-Z-SEP (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Polyclonal antibody specific for DREF polypeptide was purified from antiserum using a GST-DREF-conjugated Sepharose column after passing through a GST-conjugated-Sepharose column. The obtained IgG was precipitated at 50% ammonium sulfate saturation, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The expression plasmid pUAS-DREF1-701 contained the full-length DREF coding sequence placed under the promoter consisting of five Gal-4 binding sites and the hsp70 TATA box (pUAST vector). The plasmid pAct-Gal-4 plasmid expressed full-length yeast Gal-4 protein under control of Drosophila actin 5C promoter (pAcT-GEM3 vector). DNA transfection was carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique described earlier(23.Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Moriuchi T. Hirose F. Hui C.-C. Suzuki Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Two μg of p5′-168DPCNACAT as a reporter plasmid and 2 μg of pAct-Gal-4 were cotransfected with indicated amounts of pUAS-DREF1-701 and pAct5C-zen as expression plasmids. Total amount of effector plasmid was kept constant by addition of the expression vectors pAcGEM3 and pUAST. At 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and CAT activity was measured as described previously(23.Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Moriuchi T. Hirose F. Hui C.-C. Suzuki Y. Matsukage A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The CAT activity was quantified with an imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji film). CAT activity was normalized to the protein amount. The template used in in vitro transcription assay was the plasmid −1107DPOLACAT containing −1107 to +45 of the DNA polymerase α gene in the plasmid pOLCAT as described earlier(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was performed with Kc cell nuclear extracts prepared as detailed previously (24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kc nuclear extract (40 μg of protein) was preincubated with 2 μg of control or anti-DREF IgG in 10 μl of solution containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 12% glycerol, 0.15 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min on ice, and then the mixture was added to 40 μl of transcription mixture containing 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 12% glycerol, 0.15 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, 25 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Takara), and 0.5 μg of supercoiled −1107DPOLACAT. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30°C, and after stopping by addition of 500 μl of a stop mixture consisting of 0.25 M NaCl, 1% SDS, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 μg glycogen, nucleic acids were extracted once with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of H2O and mixed with 100 μl of DNase digestion mixture containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 μg of RNase-free DNase I, and the reaction was incubated at 37°C for 15 min. DNase digestion was completed by adding 100 μl of DNase stop buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.3 M NaCl. After phenol/chroloform extraction, RNA was precipitated with ethanol. Primer extension analysis was carried out essentially as described earlier (39.Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2624-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an oligonucleotide (28 mer) synthesized based on the nucleotide sequence of the CAT gene as a primer, 5′-GTGGTATATCCAGTGATTTTTTTCTCCA. Quantification was achieved with an image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji film). Total RNA was extracted from Kc cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method(31.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and blotted onto a sheet of GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont). Probes were radiolabeled using the random primer method(32.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). Hybridization and washing conditions were the same as described elsewhere(22.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Nishida Y. Masutani M. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Matsukage A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat XAR films and also to a Fuji-imaging plate, and relative radioactivity was quantified using a Fuji BAS 2000 imaging analyzer. Canton S embryos (0-3 h old) were collected, dechorionated, fixed, and devitellinized as described earlier(40.Yamaguchi M. Date T. Matsukage A. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 729-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 20% normal donkey serum, and 0.15% Triton X-100, and then incubated in Tris-buffered saline with either 5 μg/ml of rabbit anti-DREF IgG (used at a dilution 1:100) or hybridoma culture supernatant. Secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500 and color development was performed as for the Western blotting. Samples were examined under a microscope (Olympus BX-50) and photographed using TMAX 100 films (Eastman Kodak Co.). DREF was affinity-purified from the nuclear extract of Kc cells using DRE-conjugated latex particles and chromatography on a gel filtration column as described earlier (24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the DREF polypeptide, which has an apparent molecular mass of 86 kDa, was greater than 90%. This polypeptide specifically bound to the DREs from DNA polymerase α and PCNA genes as described previously(24.Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yield of the DREF polypeptide was about 1 μg from 1 g of Kc cells. Twenty μg of purified DREF were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 86-kDa polypeptide was isolated from the gel. Automated Edman degradation revealed that the N-terminal amino acid was blocked. Thus, we determined amino acid sequences of oligopeptides obtained by digesting the DREF polypeptide with endopeptidase Lyso-C. Oligopeptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and subjected to microsequence analysis. Three oligopeptide sequences were obtained as indicated with underlining in Fig. 1. Reverse-transcriptase-PCR with all possible combinations of degenerated primers deduced from amino acid sequences was performed to isolate cDNA fragments. PCR products of 1.7 and 1.8 kb were obtained with primer III in combination with primers VR and IIR, respectively. The 1.8-kb cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen cDNA libraries (λgt10) prepared with mRNAs extracted from 0-3-h or 3-6-h embryos. Eight clones were isolated from 4 × 105 phages. Southern blot analysis of Drosophila genomic DNA using the 1.8-kb cDNA fragment as a probe indicated that the DREF gene is present as a single copy (data not shown). The nucleotide sequence containing a complete DREF-coding region which was determined from three cDNA clones is shown in Fig. 1. This 2.7-kb cDNA fragment appears to be nearly full-length since Northern analysis demonstrated a single mRNA species of approximately 2.8 kb (see Fig. 6), and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that 5′-ends of eight cDNA clones independently isolated were mapped within 200 bp. In a primer extension experiment, the major transcription start site was mapped to 570 bp upstream from the ATG translation initiation codon (data not shown). The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 701 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 80,096 and pI of 8.5. A data base search using the FASTA program did not cover any significant homology with reported conserved motifs. DREF contains three characteristic regions, 1) rich in basic amino acids (28.7% between amino acid residues 61 and 203), 2) rich in proline (17.9% between amino acid residues 99 and 217), and 3) rich in acidic amino acids (18.0% between amino acid residues 218 and 390), as shown in Fig. 1B."

Pulse-chase analysis showed that a newly synthesized 35S-PMP70 first appeared in the cytosolic fraction and was then transported into the peroxisomal fraction. The half-life of 35S-PMP70 in the cytosolic fraction was approximately 3 min. Integration of 35S-PMP70 into membranes occurred in the peroxisomal fraction and was completed within 30 min. No proteolytic processing of 35S-PMP70 was observed. An in vitro import system was reconstituted to characterize the insertion mechanism of PMP70 into peroxisomes. Peroxisomes isolated from rat liver were incubated at 26°C with [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products of PMP70 mRNA in the presence of the cytosolic fraction. The peroxisomes were reisolated and insertion of 35S-PMP70 into the membrane was analyzed using a Na2CO3 procedure. The binding and insertion of 35S-PMP70 were dependent on temperature and incubation time and was specific for peroxisomes. Pretreatment of peroxisomes with trypsin and chymotrypsin almost abolished the binding and insertion of 35S-PMP70. The translation products contained several truncated 35S-PMP70s. The NH2 terminally truncated 35S-PMP70s, with a molecular mass greater than 50 kDa, bound to and inserted into peroxisomal membranes, whereas truncated 35S-PMP70s smaller than 45 kDa did not.

In structure, p53 is organized into three functional domains: an N-terminal domain, involved in transcriptional activation; a central domain, mediating specific DNA binding; and a C-terminal domain, responsible for oligomerization, transcriptional repression, and nonspecific DNA binding(3.Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24.Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell.

All of the major classes of small DNA tumor viruses that replicate in mammalian nuclei encode immediate-early gene products to overcome the negative effects of p53 on cell proliferation. For instance, the E1b protein of adenovirus, the E6 protein of papillomavirus and the large T antigen of papovaviruses each eliminates p53 function by interacting with a distinct domain of p53 ((3.Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)). The inactivation of p53 function by the viral immediate-early proteins results in promoting cell growth and in increasing the available pool of deoxyribonucleotides, which leads to the enhancement of viral replication. Herpesviruses are the largest among the DNA tumor viruses. Although the replication strategy of herpesviruses must be fundamentally different from that of small DNA viruses, it seems logical that they still have to deal with the negative effect imposed by p53 on cell proliferation so that host cells can enter the S-phase of the cell cycle and thus promote viral replication. Indeed, it has been shown that the immediate-early protein BZLF1 of Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes group, disrupts p53 function by binding directly to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein(26.Zhang Q. Gutsch D. Kenney S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), another member of the herpesvirus family, contains a double-stranded DNA genome of 229,354 base pairs with a potential to encode for more than 200 proteins(27.Chee M.S. Bankier A.T. Beck S. Bohni R. Brown C.M. Cerny R. Horsnell T. Hutchison C.A. Kouzarides T. Martignetti J.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

More recently, HCMV has been found to be involved in the development of coronary restenosis (31.Speir E. Modali R. Huang E.S. Leon M.B. Shawl F. Finkel T. Epstein S.E. Science. 1994; 265: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) by inducing smooth muscle cell proliferation. A number of immediate-early (IE) proteins of HCMV are expressed following entry of the virus into cells(32.Wathen M.W. Stinski M.F. J. Virol. 1982; 41: 462-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, the IE2 86K protein (referred as IE2, hereinafter) is the most studied. IE2 appears to be a promiscuous transactivator of viral and cellular gene expression ((33.Hagemeier C. Caswell R. Hayhurst G. Sinclair J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and references therein). However, to maximally stimulate transcription, both IE1 and IE2 proteins are required(34.Becker Y. Darai G. Huang E.-S. Molecular Aspects of Human Cytomegalovirus Diseases. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar). Also, IE2 autoregulates its own expression by binding to a short nucleotide sequence, termed the cis repression signal, located immediately downstream of the TATA box(35.Pizzorno M.C. Hayward G.S. J.

To date, only a limited number of studies have been performed to assess the functional domains of IE2. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the C terminus of IE2 is involved in such protein activities as activation, autoregulation, and binding to retinoblastoma protein, TBP, and TFIIB ((33.Hagemeier C. Caswell R. Hayhurst G. Sinclair J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2897-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and references therein). The fact that immediate-early proteins of both large and small DNA viruses can associate with p53 (3.Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang Q. Gutsch D. Kenney S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) naturally leads to the prediction that HCMV, by analogy, should employ a similar mechanism to inactivate p53 function. Actually, the IE2 protein of HCMV has been implicated in the disruption of the transactivation function of p53 (31.Speir E. Modali R. Huang E.S. Leon M.B. Shawl F. Finkel T. Epstein S.E. Science. 1994; 265: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Evidence collected so far suggests that the interaction between IE2 and p53 is of critical importance to cell growth and HCMV replication. Thus, to further understand the biological significance of the interaction between IE2 and p53, it is important to define the interaction domains of the two proteins and to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this interaction. This report demonstrates that two regions of IE2 are required to inactivate p53 function. The N-terminal portion of IE2 interacts with p53. The specific DNA-binding activity of p53, however, seems unaffected by IE2. Repression of the transactivation activity of p53 requires, in addition to the N-terminal end of IE2, a transcriptional repression activity conferred by the C terminus of IE2. pIE2, which expresses the HCMV IE2 86-kDa protein, was constructed by inserting the HCMV Towne strain IE2 cDNA (37.Pizzorno M.C. Mullen M.A. Chang Y.N. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3839-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) between the HindIII and BamHI sites of pSG424(38.Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). pIE2ID(136-289) and pIE2ID(45-289) were constructed by deleting the SmaI-XhoI and HpaI-XhoI fragments of pIE2, respectively. pIE2CD189 and pIE2CD80 were constructed by deleting the DraIII-BamHI and BstXI-BamHI fragments of pIE2, respectively. Plasmids expressing GAL4-IE2 derivatives, pGAL4-IE2, pGAL4-IE2(290-579), pGAL4-IE2(290-390), pGAL4-IE2(391-579) and pGAL4-IE2(1-289), were cloned by inserting the corresponding DNA fragment of IE2 between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSG424. Plasmids pSVp53ND50, pSVp53V143A, pSVp53V143ACD30, and pSVp53V143ACD55, all of which express derivatives of p53 (25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L. Chuang J.Y. Lai M.Y. Lin Y.S. J. Biol.

Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar). Plasmids p3PREcCAT, pCMVTAg, pLexA-VP16, pG5TKCAT, and pL6EC were described previously(25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) into the SmaI site of pL6EC. pGEM4IE2, pGEM4IE2ID(136-289), pGEM4IE2(1-289), and pGEM4IE2(290-579) were created by inserting the DNA fragment encoding the corresponding IE2 peptide between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGEM4 (Promega). Saos-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded 12 h before transfection. Calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection was performed as described previously(25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L. Chuang J.Y. Lai M.Y. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Typically, the transfection lasted 12 h. CAT activity was measured 48 h after transfection and quantitated as described previously(25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L. Chuang J.Y. Lai M.Y. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For temperature shift assays, the incubation temperature was switched to 30°C for 24 h after incubation at 37°C for 36 h. An equal amount (approximately 50 μg) of proteins from extracts of transfected cells was boiled in a sample buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue) for 5 min and then loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore). p53, IE2, and GAL4-IE2 derivatives were detected with antibodies against p53(25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), IE2 (DuPont), and GAL4 (UBI), respectively, using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro transcription/translation was performed with the TNT system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The templates were pGEM4IE2, pGEM4IE2ID(136-289), pGEM4IE2(1-289), and pGEM4IE2(290-579). GST, GST-p53 and GST-p53CD55 were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli XA90 strain according to standard protocols(40.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5018) Google Scholar, 44.Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 45.Lin Y.S. Ha I. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. Green M.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The ligand concentrations, using bovine serum albumin as a standard, were 6.2, 0.8, and 1.3 mg/ml of resin for GST, GST-p53, and GST-p53CD55, respectively. Aliquots (25 μl) of the GST, GST-p53, and GST-p53CD55 beads were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled IE2 derivatives. After being washed with buffer D(46.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9116) Google Scholar), bound proteins were eluted from beads with buffer D containing 0.1 M glutathione and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A peptide sequence comparison between IE2 and other known viral p53-binding proteins, such as adenovirus E1b protein, SV40 T antigen, HPV E6 protein, and Epstein-Barr virus BZLF1 protein, did not reveal any significant homology. To determine the region(s) of IE2 required to interact with p53, we sought to establish a system for the analysis of the effect of IE2 on the transactivation function of p53. The inclusion of IE2 in a transient co-transfection assay caused a moderate reduction of p53 activity, which probably reflected the fact that the expression level of IE2 was too low to optimally interact with p53 (data not shown). p53 is known to inhibit the expression of genes lacking PRE in the promoter(20.Ginsberg D. Mechta F. Yaniv M. Oren M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9979-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 21.Mercer W.E. Shields M.T. Lin D. Appella E. Ullrich S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1958-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 22.Santhanam U. Ray A. Sehgal P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), which may be responsible for the low expression level of IE2. To overcome this obstacle, a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant, p53V143A(39.Zhang W. Guo X.Y. Hu G.Y. Liu W.B. Shay J.W. Deisseroth A.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2535-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), was substituted. As expected, the expression of IE2 was dramatically increased with the p53V143A system; in addition, once IE2 was made, it was no longer sensitive to repression by the wild-type p53 function (data not shown). There seemed one more merit to the choice of the temperature-sensitive p53 mutant for study; p53 protein is almost undetectable within cells under physiological conditions. Although the level of p53 protein can be dramatically increased by DNA damage(3.Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the entry of linear Epstein-Barr virus DNA, whose ends seem to resemble damaged DNA, alone is not sufficient to induce p53 expression; induction of p53 synthesis is achieved only after the expression of viral immediate-early proteins (47.Allday M.J. Sinclair A. Parker G. Crawford D.H. Farrell P.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Likewise, the linear HCMV genome would not be interpreted by cells as a damaged genome and thus should not provide a stimulus for the induction of p53. Rather, the up-regulation of p53 synthesis may require viral immediate-early gene expression. Thus, use of this temperature-sensitive mutant should closely imitate physiological conditions; IE2 is expressed first, and p53 function is then induced by a shift of the assaying temperature. In this sense, p53V143A should not only provide an easy but also a biologically relevant approach to the study of IE2-p53 interaction. As shown in Fig. 1A, IE2 repressed p53 function efficiently (compare lanes 2 and 3). Repression was specific for IE2 because another HCMV IE protein, IE1, had no effect on the transactivation function of p53 (data not shown). Removal of IE2 residues 136-289 consistently resulted in a small increase in the protein's repression activity toward p53 (compare lane 4 to lane 3). However, a further deletion of IE2 residues 45-135 largely reduced the protein's repression activity (compare lane 5 to lane 2). We thus concluded that a region encompassing IE2 residues 45-135 was required for the inhibition of p53 function. Besides, Fig. 1A also indicates that the C terminus of IE2 was also involved in the repression, because both C-terminal truncation mutants, IE2CD80 and IE2CD189, weakly repressed p53 activity (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 6 and 7 to lane 2), suggesting that the intactness of IE2's C terminus was required for full repression activity. (Further supports for this point were provided in the experiment of Fig. 4A.) Note that the inability of IE2 derivatives in repressing p53 function was not due to a low level of protein being made. In fact, all three inactive IE2 mutants were more abundant than the other two active derivatives (Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lanes 5, 6, and 7 to lanes 3 and 4). Neither could the low CAT activity be attributed to a fluctuation in the level of p53 (Fig. 1B, right panel), indicating that IE2 derivatives had little effect on the expression of p53. We demonstrated in the above experiments that two regions of IE2 were required for the inactivation of p53 function. Next, we performed experiments to map the region(s) of p53 required for the IE2-p53 interaction. As shown in Fig. 2, the transactivation function of both p53V143A and p53V143ACD30, a derivative lacking the most C-terminal 30 residues of p53V143A, was repressed by IE2 to a certain degree (compare lanes 2 and 4 to lanes 3 and 5). However, a further deletion of 25 residues from the C terminus of p53V143ACD30 resulted in a complete loss of responsiveness to IE2 (compare lane 6 with lane 7). The observation that p53V143ACD30 had higher transactivation activity than the other two p53 derivatives (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 with lanes 2 and 6) was consistent with previous reports that removal of C-terminal 30 residues enhances the transactivation activity of p53, whereas removal of C-terminal 55 residues results in a p53 derivative with transactivation activity similar to that of full-length p53(25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L. Chuang J.Y. Lai M.Y. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 48.Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Like that of p53V143A (Fig. 1B), the expression of C-terminal deletion mutants of p53V143A appeared unaffected by IE2 (data not shown). On the basis of these results, we concluded that a region encompassing residues 339-363 of p53 was involved in the IE2-p53 interaction. Since transactivation by p53V143ACD55 was not affected by IE2 (Fig. 2, compare lane 7 to lane 6), we could further conclude that neither the inhibition of p53-dependent transactivation by IE2 was caused by the competition for (or squelching of) a transcription factor required for p53 function by IE2, nor was the inhibition of transcription due to the binding of IE2 to a putative cis repression signal located around the transcription initiation site of the assaying promoter. Since the C terminus of p53 was involved in the IE2-p53 interaction (Fig. 2), we speculated that IE2 might not affect the p53 specific DNA-binding activity, which is located in the central region of the protein. To test this idea, an in vivo DNA binding assay (42.Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) was performed. Briefly, one copy of PRE was placed immediately downstream of the reporter's TATA box. Thus, binding of a p53 derivative to the PRE of the reporter should block assembly of the transcription initiation complex on the promoter and therefore reduce CAT activity. p53ND50, a derivative providing only p53 DNA-binding activity and thereby causing no negative effect on the expression of IE2(3.Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 23.el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7836) Google Scholar), reduced transcription of the reporter containing PRE (Fig. 3, compare lane 3 with lane 2, and also lane 12 with lane 11). The reduction was specific because transcription of a corresponding reporter without PRE was not affected (Fig. 3, compare lane 8 with lane 7). The SV40 large T antigen, known to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of p53 by forming a large T-p53 complex, restored CAT activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, compare lanes 12, 13, and 14 with lane 11). In contrast, IE2 showed little activity to eliminate the transcriptional block (Fig. 3, compare lane 4 with lane 3), although IE2 was expressed to a level comparable with that of the p53V143A system (data not shown). A reasonable interpretation for these observations was that the p53 derivative was capable of binding PRE in the presence of IE2. Alternatively, another plausible explanation was that IE2 indeed inhibited p53 to bind PRE; in addition, IE2's failure to restore CAT activity simply reflected that the p53 derivative, under the influence of IE2, might somehow function as a nonspecific transcriptional repressor. This plausibility gained some support from the fact that IE2 functioned as a direct transcriptional repressor (Fig. 4A) and that the repression domain of p53 (24.Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25.Hsu Y.S. Tang F.M. Liu W.L. Chuang J.Y. Lai M.Y. Lin Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6966-6974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was still left intact in the p53 derivative used for the in vivo DNA binding assay. However, control experiments revealed that IE2 could not significantly inhibit transcription of a promoter nonspecifically (Fig. 3, lane 5; also see Fig. 4A, lane 10), nor did the p53 derivative, in the presence of IE2, exhibit any negative effect on the transcription of the promoter lacking PRE (Fig. 3, lane 9). Taken together, the transcriptional block by the p53 derivative was PRE-dependent (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 7 and 8), implying that binding of PRE by the p53 derivative was responsible for the negative effect. Moreover, the presence of IE2, unlike that of SV40 large T antigen, had little detrimental effect on the specific DNA-binding activity of p53 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 12 and 14). Data collected so far indicate that inhibition of p53 function by IE2 appeared not to be caused by a loss of the specific DNA binding activity of p53. In light of this, it is worth noting that adenovirus E1b also has no effect on the DNA binding activity of p53 (43.Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). E1b represses the p53's target gene transcription by tethering, via its binding to the N terminus of p53, a transcriptional repression domain to the promoter(43.Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To examine whether IE2 contains a transcriptional repression domain, we performed repression studies as described previously(43.Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In brief, chimeric proteins between the DNA binding domain of GAL4(1-147) and IE2 derivatives were first constructed, and then their repression activity was assayed with the reporter pG5TKCAT, which bears five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter. The reason for choosing thymidine kinase promoter as a reporter was that this promoter, unlike the E1b TATA promoter used in the above studies, possesses detectable transcriptional activity, which is necessary for the assay of repression. Two lines of evidence indicate that there was probably little change in the configuration and activity of IE2 when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. First, GAL4-IE2 and IE2 exhibited comparable activity in repressing p53 function, and second, GAL4-IE2 derivatives behaved like their corresponding IE2 derivatives, regarding the repression of p53 function (data not shown). Accordingly, it should be appropriate to transfer conclusions drawn from studies of the GAL4-IE2 fusion protein to IE2. As shown in Fig. 4A, GAL4-IE2 repressed transcription of the reporter pG5TKCAT (compare lane 3 with lane 1). The repression was dependent upon both the GAL4 and IE2 modules of the chimeric protein, since neither the GAL4 DNA binding domain nor the IE2 alone was able to significantly repress transcription from the"

The nucleotide sugar, which is synthesized in the cytosol, must first be transported into the Golgi lumen by a specific UDP-galactose transporter. Previously, a mutant polarized epithelial cell (MDCKII-RCAr) with a 2% residual rate of transport of UDP-galactose into the lumen of Golgi vesicles was described (Brandli, A. W., Hansson, G. C., RodriguezBoulan, E., and Simons, K.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16283-16290). The mutant has an enrichment in glucosyl ceramide and cell surface glycoconjugates bearing terminal N-acetylglucosamine, as well as a 75% reduction in sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids.We have now studied the biosynthesis of galactose containing proteoglycans in this mutant and the corresponding parental cell line. Wild-type Madin-Darby canine kidney cells synthesize significant amounts of chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, and keratan sulfate, while the above mutant synthesizes chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate but not keratan sulfate, the only proteoglycan containing galactose in its glycosaminoglycan polymer. The mutant also synthesizes chondroitin 6-sulfate rather than only chondroitin 4-sulfate as wild-type cells. Together, the above results demonstrate that the Golgi membrane UDP-galactose transporter is rate-limiting in the supply of UDP-galactose into the Golgi lumen; this in turn results in selective galactosylation of macromolecules. Apparently, the Km for galactosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of linkage regions of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate are significantly lower than those participating in the synthesis of keratan sulfate polymer, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. The results also suggest that the 6-O-sulfotransferases, in the absence of their natural substrates (keratan sulfate) may catalyze the sulfation of chondroitin 4-sulfate as alternative substrate.

It was shown previously that Dictyostelium MAP kinase ERK2 is required for normal activation of adenylyl cyclase and erk2 null cells are aggregation-deficient. In this manuscript, we show that the Dictyostelium MAP kinase ERK2 is rapidly and transiently activated in response to the chemoattractant cAMP. This response requires cAMP receptors, but is independent of the coupled Gα2 subunit and the only known Gβ subunit. These data indicate that ligand-mediated receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase requires two receptor-dependent pathways, one of which requires heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gα2 and the only known Gβ subunit, and the second of which requires ERK2.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone, five distinct MAP kinase activation pathways have been defined that control mating, pseudohyphal growth, cell integrity, response to osmotic shock, and sporulation(6.Levin D.E. Errede B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Little is known about the diversity of mechanisms that can lead to the activation of MAP kinase cascades. In S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, some MAP kinase cascades can be controlled, at least in part, through Gβγ subunits(7.Herskowitz I.

Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In Dictyostelium, the multicellular organism is formed via the chemotactic aggregation of up to 105 cells. The chemoattractant is extracellular cAMP that binds to the serpentine receptors cAR1 or cAR3, which are coupled to the heterotrimeric G protein containing the Gα2 subunit, activating guanylyl and adenylyl cyclases, triggering alterations in the cytoskeleton, and inducing gene expression(11.Firtel R.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1427-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12.Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13.Sun T.J.

Recent results indicate that the Gβγ subunits released by the ligand activate adenylyl cyclase, whereas the coupled Gα2 subunit is thought to regulate a variety of other effectors(11.Firtel R.A.

The aggregation-stage adenylyl cyclase in Dictyostelium has a similar structure to that of mammalian adenylyl cyclases(18.Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar); however, the aggregation-stage adenylyl cyclase has a more complex activation pathway compared with known activation pathways for mammalian adenylyl cyclases(19.Tang W. Gilman A. Cell. 1992; 70: 869-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In addition to the Gβγ subunit, adenylyl cyclase activation in Dictyostelium also requires a pleckstrin homology domain containing protein designated CRAC(20.Insall R. Kuspa A. Lilly P. Shaulsky G. Levin L. Loomis W. Devreotes P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21.Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14123-14129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, surprisingly, a MAP kinase ERK2. erk2 null cells do not aggregate due to their deficiency in the ability to activate adenylyl cyclase and relay the cAMP signal(22.Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this communication, we show that the MAP kinase ERK2 is rapidly and transiently activated in response to cAMP. The kinetics of this response are similar to those of the activation of adenylyl cyclase. The response requires the cAMP receptor necessary for mediating other cAMP-mediated responses, but is independent of the coupled Gα2 and the only known Gβ subunit. Our data indicate that receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase requires two receptor-dependent pathways, one requiring Gβγ and involving ERK2. Activation of ERK2 was measured in cells competent to aggregate (aggregation-competent cells), the stage at which the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase is maximal. Vegetative Dictyostelium cells were washed and suspended in non-nutrient buffer (Na/KPO4 (pH 6.2) or MES-PDF) (23.Mehdy M.C. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) at 5 × 106 cells/ml and pulsed with 30 nM cAMP for 4 h to induce cAMP receptors, Gα2, and other components of the aggregation response. Cells were washed, concentrated 2-fold, shaken for 10 min, and stimulated with 20 μM cAMP. Samples were taken at the time points indicated, immediately lysed in 5 × SDS sample buffer, and size-fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels containing MBP as described previously(24.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal.

Proteins in the gels were denatured in guanidine hydrochloride and renatured in Tween and kinase activity was assayed in situ as described previously(24.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 26.Gaskins C.

Rabbit anti-GST/ERK2 serum was affinity-purified by the method of Harlow and Lane(27.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The whole serum was diluted 10-fold with PBS and then passed over a GST column (see below) to remove anti-GST antibodies. The flow-through was passed three additional times over the GST column, which had been regenerated by washing with 0.2 M glycine (pH 2.2) followed by PBS. The final flow-through was applied to a GST-ERK2 column in PBS. The column was washed with PBS and then with PBS containing 1 M KCl, and bound antibody was eluted with 10 bed volumes of 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.2). The eluate was collected in a tube containing 1 bed volume of 1 M Tris (pH 8.0). GST and GST-ERK2 columns were prepared according to the method of Koff et al.(28.Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). We examined the activity of ERK2 in response to the chemoattractant cAMP using an in-gel assay in which a MAP kinase substrate, MBP, is embedded in the gel. The samples were size-fractionated using standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques, renatured, and their ability to phosphorylate MBP assayed (24.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The addition of cAMP to aggregation-stage, wild-type cells resulted in a rapid activation of an ~42-kDa kinase (the predicted size of ERK2) (Fig. 1). Gels lacking MBP showed no phosphorylation at this mobility (data not shown; see (26.Gaskins C. Maeda M. Firtel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6996-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Stimulation of kinase activity was observed within 10 s and peaked at ~50 to 60 s. After 2 min, the activity was significantly reduced, and by 4 min the activity had returned to near-basal levels. These kinetics of the activation and subsequent adaptation of kinase activity were similar to those of cAMP activation of adenylyl cyclase and significantly slower than those of cAMP activation of guanylyl cyclase (12.Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15.Van Haastert P.J.M. Papa S. Azzi A. Tager J.M. Adenine Nucleotides in Cellular Energy Transfer and Signal Transduction. Basel, Switzerland1992: 379-386Crossref Google Scholar, 29.Theibert A. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ERK2, other phosphorylated bands were observed, the strongest of which is at ~30 kDa. In some genetic backgrounds (see below and data not shown), this kinase was differentially stimulated or repressed by cAMP stimulation. To confirm that cAMP-stimulated MBP phosphorylating activity was ERK2, we examined the activation profile in erk2 null cells and cells overexpressing ERK2. No stimulation of this activity was observed in erk2 null cells, while expression of ERK2 in the erk2 null background (complemented erk2 null cells) resulted in the restoration of the activity (Fig. 1). In addition, these erk2 null complemented cells showed normal aggregation and morphological differentiation that was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells ((30.Gaskins C. Clark A.M. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); data not shown). The maximum level of kinase activity in the erk2 null complemented cells was higher than that in wild-type cells, probably due to an overexpression of the kinase (see below). Overexpression of ERK2 in wild-type cells resulted in an ~4-fold higher level of stimulated kinase activity (data not shown). When the samples were analyzed by Western blot with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibody made against a GST-ERK2 fusion (see “Materials and Methods”), a band of 42 kDa was observed that was absent in erk2 null cells (Fig. 2A). A higher level of ERK2 was observed in the ERK2 overexpressor strain (Fig. 2A). This antibody did not interact with the other known Dictyostelium MAP kinase, ERK1 (Fig. 2B), or with other proteins with the same mobility as ERK2, although it did interact with some other proteins (Fig. 2, A and B). In the complemented null cells overexpressing ERK2, the increased protein was greater than the increased maximal level of activity seen in this assay (Fig. 1). We assume that either not all of the kinase could be activated or the assay was not linear at high kinase levels. A background activity at the same molecular weight as ERK2 was seen in erk2 null cells and in unstimulated wild-type cells (Fig. 1). Notably, this unstimulated activity was not detectably increased by overexpression of ERK2, suggesting that the kinase activity at this mobility may not be ERK2 and that ERK2 basal activity was very low. There is at least one other MAP kinase, ERK1, in Dictyostelium and may be responsible for the background activity in these assays. ERK1 has a similar electrophoretic mobility to that of ERK2 on these gels, uses MBP as a substrate, and is active at the same time in development(26.Gaskins C. Maeda M. Firtel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6996-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The absence of stimulation of the band at this mobility in erk2 null cells suggests ERK1 is not stimulated in response to cAMP, consistent with previous results (26.Gaskins C. Maeda M. Firtel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6996-7012Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the ERK2 stimulation in response to cAMP in wild-type cells was quantitated, we observed an ~40-fold increase in the level of kinase activity at this mobility. If the background band observed in erk2 null cells were subtracted, the relative level of stimulation would be higher. To determine which components of the known cAMP-dependent signal transduction pathways may regulate the activation of ERK2, we examined the ability of cAMP to stimulate ERK2-MBP phosphorylating activity in various genetic backgrounds. Previous results showed that either cAMP receptor cAR1 or cAR3 is required for mediating aggregation-stage responses to cAMP(31.Insall R.H. Soede R.D.M. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32.Soede R.D.M. Insall R.H. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 1997-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are coupled to the G protein containing the Gα2 subunit, the only one of the eight known Gα subunits found to couple to cAMP receptors and mediate cAMP receptor-controlled pathways(11.Firtel R.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1427-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12.Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14.Kumagai A.

Cells lacking either Gα2, cAR1, cAR3, or the only known Gβ subunit through engineered gene disruptions, showed no cAMP stimulation of adenylyl cyclase or guanylyl cyclase in vivo(14.Kumagai A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These cells lack known receptor/G protein/effector interactions, including: the absence of detectable cAMP receptor high affinity binding sites and the absence of GTPγS-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cell lysates. These results suggest that cAMP receptors are no longer coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein in the gβ null cells and that there is only a single Gβ subunit in this organism(17.Wu L.-J. Kuwayama H. van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When ERK2 activation was examined in cells lacking cAR1 (car1 null cells)(38.Sun T.J. Vanhaastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the major aggregation-stage receptor, the level of ERK2 activation was significantly reduced (~80%) compared with that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 3). This residual stimulation was absent in the car1/car3 double knockout strain, indicating that cAMP-mediated ERK2 activation requires cAMP receptors (Fig. 3). To examine the possible role of heterotrimeric G proteins in ERK2 activation, gα2 and gβ null strains(14.Kumagai A. Hadwiger J.A. Pupillo M. Firtel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1220-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Lilly P. Wu L.J. Welker D.L. Devreotes P.N. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were first transformed with a plasmid that constitutively expresses cAR1 during growth and development. This measure ensured that these cells had appropriate levels of receptors. Surprisingly, in gα2 and gβ null cells constitutively expressing cAR1, the ERK2 pathway was also stimulated. However, the onset of activation was delayed, and its peak was reduced compared to that in wild-type cells. When quantified, the maximal level of activation in the gα2 and gβ null strains varied between ~40 and 80% of that observed in wild-type cells (six separate experiments) and between ~50 and 60% of that in wild-type cells constitutively expressing cAR1 (data not shown). Our analysis has shown that the MAP kinase ERK2 is transiently activated in response to chemotactic signaling by cAMP and that this activation is dependent on cARs but is independent of Gα2, the known Gα subunit that couples to cAR1 and cAR3. Further, the activation of ERK2 occurred independently of the only known Dictyostelium Gβ subunit, that like Gα2, is required for the in vivo activation of adenylyl cyclase. The slower kinetics and the reduced level of activation of ERK2 in gβ and gα2 null cells compared with wild-type cells nevertheless suggest that a G protein-mediated pathway is important in obtaining a completely wild-type response. erk2 null cells express adenylyl cyclase aggregation-stage adenylyl cyclase and CRAC, another required component for this pathway (22.Segall J. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Ecke M. Maeda M. Gaskins C. Firtel R. Loomis W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), indicating that ERK2 is not required for the expression of these genes. The kinetics of activation and deactivation parallel those of adenylyl cyclase, suggesting that activated ERK2 may be required continuously for the activation of adenylyl cyclase. Other results have shown that receptor-mediated activation of at least some aggregation-stage genes in response to cAMP pulses is normal in erk2 null cells(30.Gaskins C. Clark A.M. Aubry L. Segall J. Firtel R.A. Genes & Dev. 1996; 10: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude that ERK2 is required for the expression of some unknown gene and that the kinetics of activation are fortuitously similar to those of adenylyl cyclase. Two different receptor-mediated pathways are involved in cAMP activation of adenylyl cyclase; one requires the Gα2 and Gβ subunits and the other requires ERK2 (11.Firtel R.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1427-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12.Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22.Segall J. Kuspa A.

We now find that ERK2 is activated by cAMP and that this requires cAMP receptors, but is independent of either Gα2 or the known Gβ that are also required for adenylyl cyclase activation. While the possibility of another Gβ subunit can never be completely excluded, there is significant biochemical evidence that Dictyostelium has only one Gβ subunit as described above (17.Wu L.-J.

Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the weight of this evidence, we entertain the intriguing possibility that ERK2 is activated by a pathway that may be independent of heterotrimeric G proteins. One model to accommodate our observations is that the receptor functions as a docking site for proteins that stimulate downstream pathways, one of which leads to the stimulation of the ERK2 activation cascade (Fig. 4). This model has precedent in the known docking of different effectors to activated receptor tyrosine kinases. The underlying mechanism for docking to serpentine receptors such as cAR1 could be similar to the binding mechanisms that allow heterotrimeric G proteins to interact with ligand-bound (“activated”) receptors or receptor kinases to interact with and phosphorylate the ligand-bound but not free receptors(40.Palczewski K.

As described above, the binding and phosphorylation of rhodopsin and β-adrenergic receptors by their respective kinases in mammals requires ligand binding, but is independent of G proteins(40.Palczewski K.

In Dictyostelium, cAMP stimulation of Ca2+ influx and cAMP-mediated activation of post-aggregative gene expression in the multicellular stages (which is activated through the transcription factor GBF and a high, continuous level of cAMP) are known to be independent of the identified Gβ subunit and have been proposed to be G protein-independent(42.Milne J.L.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 737-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both G proteins and receptor kinases interact with receptors in response to ligands, and recent evidence indicates that STAT transcription factors are activated through the angiotensin II receptor (44.Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not known whether a JAK kinase directly couples to this receptor. With the biochemical evidence that receptor kinase binding and phosphorylation is ligand-dependent but G protein-independent, it is possible that other heterotrimeric G protein-independent pathways will be identified as future genetic analysis permits further dissection of pathways controlled via serpentine receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1566080932,"Rab proteins are Ras-related small GTPases that are digeranylgeranylated at carboxyl-terminal cysteines, a modification essential for their action as molecular switches regulating intracellular vesicular transport. Geranylgeranylation of Rabs is a complex reaction that requires a catalytic Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase) and a Rab escort protein (REP). REP binds unprenylated Rab and presents it to Rab GGTase. After GG transfer, REP remains associated with diGG-Rab, which leads to insertion of the Rab into a specific membrane. We used recombinant Rab1a single cysteine mutants that accept only one GG group to study the mechanism of the digeranylgeranylation reaction. Using the prenylation assay, gel filtration chromatography, and density ultracentrifugation, we show that REP, but not Rab GGTase, forms a stable complex with unprenylated, monoGG- and diGG-Rab1a. The REP•monoGG-Rab1a complex is stable in the presence of detergents or phospholipids, whereas the REP•diGG-Rab1a complex partially dissociates under these conditions. The stoichiometry of the REP•Rab complex appears to be 1:1 before prenylation. Prenylation induces a change in complex stoichiometry, with the formation of a 2:2 or 2:1 REP•Rab complex. A possible mechanism by which Rab proteins are digeranylgeranylated is suggested by the current studies. We propose that each geranylgeranyl addition is an independent reaction that leads to the production of monoGG-Rab and diGG-Rab, respectively. The stability of the REP•monoGG-Rab complex prevents monoGG-Rab from dissociating from REP prior to the second geranylgeranylation reaction, ensuring efficient digeranylgeranylation of Rab substrates.

https://openalex.org/W2051182140,"Conformational stability is a prerequisite for the physiological activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 protein can be allosterically activated for DNA binding by phosphorylation or through noncovalent interaction with proteins such as DnaK, the Escherichia coli homologue of the heat shock protein Hsp70. We present in vitro evidence for a rapid temperature-dependent change in the conformation and tetrameric nature of wild-type p53 upon incubation at 37°C, which correlates with a permanent loss in DNA binding activity. We show that p53 is allosterically regulated for stabilization of the wild-type conformation and DNA binding activity at 37°C by binding of two classes of ligands to regulatory sites on the N and C terminus of the molecule through which an intrinsic instability of p53 is neutralized. Deletion of the domain conferring instability at the C terminus is sufficient to confer enhanced stability to the total protein. DnaK binding to the C terminus can profoundly protect p53 at 37°C from a temperature-dependent loss of the DNA binding activity but does not renature or activate denatured p53. In contrast, another activator of the DNA binding activity of latent p53, the monoclonal antibody PAb421, which also interacts with the C terminus of the protein, is not able to protect p53 from thermal denaturation. Two monoclonal antibodies to the N terminus of p53, PAb1801 and DO-1, do not activate the latent DNA binding function of p53 but can protect the p53 wild-type conformation at 37°C. Thus, activation of the DNA binding function of p53 is not synonymous with protection from thermal denaturation, and therefore, both of these pathways may be used in cells to control the physiological activity of p53. The protection of p53 conformation from heat denaturation by interacting proteins suggests a novel mechanism by which p53 function could be regulated in vivo.

In contrast, the ubiquitous, housekeeping isoform of the exchanger (NHE1) is stimulated by cAMP in some cell types. Optimal activity of NHE3 as well as NHE1 requires the presence of ATP. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of ATP dependence and cAMP regulation of NHE3, a series of mutations were constructed by progressively truncating segments of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the transporter at amino acid positions 684, 638, and 579 (named NHE3Δ684, NHE3Δ638, and NHE3Δ579). In addition, chimeric antiporters were constructed with the N-terminal transmembrane domain of NHE3 linked to the entire cytoplasmic region of NHE1 (chimera NHE3/1) or vice versa (chimera NHE1/3). These constructs were heterologously expressed in antiport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells, and their activities were assessed by fluorimetric measurements of intracellular pH and by radioisotope determinations of Na+ influx. Forskolin, which directly stimulates adenylate cyclase, inhibited NHE3 as well as NHE1/3, but not NHE3/1, suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of NHE3 was sufficient to confer sensitivity to inhibition by cAMP. Forskolin also inhibited the truncated mutant NHE3Δ684 to an extent similar to that for wild type NHE3. However, the inhibitory effect was greatly reduced in NHE3Δ638 and more profound truncations (NHE3Δ579) obliterated the effect of forskolin. These findings suggest that a region found between amino acids 579 and 684 is essential for the cAMP response of NHE3. In contrast, comparable ATP dependence was observed in all exchanger constructs examined. These observations indicate that ATP dependence is conferred by a region of the molecule in or adjacent to the transmembrane domain, which is most conserved between isoforms.

(9.Cook W.J. Bugg C.E. Pullman B. Goldblum N. Metal Ligand Interactions in Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Part 2. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht, Holland1977: 231-256Google Scholar) and (10.Whitfield D.M. Stojkovski S. Sarkar B. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1993; 122: 171-225Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar) for reviews). NMR and infrared spectroscopy have complemented this information(11.Angyal S.J. Aust. J. Chem. 1972; 25: 1957-1966Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12.Angyal, S. J., Davies, K. P. (1971) Chem. Commun. 500-501Google Scholar). However, the complex-forming properties of calcium with carbohydrates attached to lipid moieties remain largely unexplored. Most of the evidence for complex formation so far comes from liposome aggregation or lipid binding studies using solid phase presentation of the lipids, either bound to a solid support or in liposomes. In addition, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy was used to provide information about the structure of the complex of Ca2+ with digalactosyldiacylglycerol and the groups on the carbohydrate that chelate with the divalent cation in a membranous environment in the presence of water(19.Menikh A. Fragata M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The polyvalent nature of presentation in lipid bilayers or on a solid support increases the affinity of the interaction. The difficulty of observing the divalent cation-carbohydrate interactions in solution (especially in aqueous solution) given their weak nature and the solubility characteristics of lipid-bound carbohydrates makes the study of such interactions rather challenging. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) ( 1The abbreviations used are: ESI-MS electrospray ionization mass spectrometry GalCer galactosylceramide CBS acid form of cerebroside sulfate (galactosylceramide I3 sulfate) CID collision-induced decomposition Lex Lewis X determinant (Galβ1→4-(Fucα1→3)-GlcNAc).) is a relatively new technique, which can detect the presence of a complex in a solvent in which it is soluble(21.Siuzdak G.

The soft ionization conditions employed allow the transfer of complexes present in solution to the gas phase with minimal decomposition(26.Smith R.D. Light-Wahl K.J. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 493-501Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). ESI-MS has recently been used to detect the divalent cation-mediated complexation of the carbohydrate of some glycolipids, resulting in the homotypic and in some cases heterotypic oligomerization of these lipids in methanol(21.Siuzdak G. Ichikawa Y. Caulfield T.J. Munoz B. Wong C. Nicolau K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2877-2881Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This technique was successful at detecting Ca2+ oligomerization of the Lex oligosaccharide(21.Siuzdak G. Ichikawa Y. Caulfield T.J. Munoz B. Wong C. Nicolau K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2877-2881Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), while 1H-NMR failed to detect metal binding or evidence of oligomerization of the free sugar in water(27.Wormald M.R. Edge C.J. Dwek R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1214-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this paper we present evidence for the noncovalent association among galactosylceramide, Ca2+, and the anion of cerebroside sulfate in methanol solution using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Positive ion scans showed that Ca2+ caused homotypic oligomerization of GalCer and that it bound to monomers of CBS anion to form a singly charged positive ion. Dimers of CBS anions with Ca2+ form a neutral species and are not detected. However, Ca2+ caused heterodimerization of GalCer and CBS anion in methanol. Although the heterotypic complexes were of low abundance compared with the others at low declustering potentials, the heterotypic dimer had greater stability than any other complex. All reagents and solvents used were either analytical grade or high pressure liquid chromatography grade. Calcium chloride (CaCl2•2H2O) was purchased from Fisher (Fairlawn, NJ). Methanol was from Caledon (Georgetown, Ontario, Canada), stearic acid from Fluka (Switzerland), 1-β-D-galactosyl sphingosine (psychosine) from Sigma, and oxalyl chloride from Aldrich. Galactosylceramide was synthesized from psychosine by reaction with stearoyl chloride (prepared from stearic acid and oxalyl chloride) in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of aqueous sodium acetate(28.Kopaczyk K.C. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 140-145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel and finally precipitated from a small volume of chloroform/methanol (90/10) by the addition of excess acetone. The identity of the final product was established as 1-O-galactosyl-2-N-stearoyl sphingosine by thin layer chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Galactosylceramide I3 sulfate was synthesized from lysosulfatide (psychosine sulfate) prepared from bovine brain sulfatide and stearoyl chloride as described previously(29.Koshy K.M. Boggs J.M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1983; 34: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The structure of the product was verified as above. 1H NMR showed that it was in the NH4+ salt form (data not shown). However, the NH4+ adduct was not detected in the presence of excess Ca2+, indicating that the Ca2+ completely displaced it from the lipid. When it was converted to the Ca2+ salt form and examined by ESI-MS in the absence of excess Ca2+, it formed the Na+ salt form due to exogenous Na+ present in the system. Therefore, it was necessary to study it in the presence of excess Ca2+. Stock solutions of the two lipids were prepared at concentrations of 550 nmol/ml (GalCer) and 385 nmol/ml (CBS) in methanol. A stock solution of CaCl2•2H2O in methanol was prepared at a concentration of 6.8 μmol/ml. Aliquots of these solutions were appropriately mixed and made up to the requisite volume to give the final concentrations required for mass spectral analysis. Insolubility of the lipids in water or methanol/water solutions precluded their study in these solvents. Electrospray mass spectra were acquired on a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Both positive and negative ion scans were performed. Concentrations of the lipids were usually kept at 20-50 nmol/ml and the Ca2+ concentration at 200 nmol/ml for optimum spectral quality. For CID experiments, higher concentrations of the lipids were used for greater signal strength. The solutions were introduced at the flow rate of 5 μl/min. The complex-forming property of galactose with Ca2+ in crystalline form has been well documented(30.Cook W.J. Bugg C.E. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, Ca2+ is coordinated to five hydroxyl groups, contributed by three α-D-galactose molecules, and to three water molecules. Since each galactose can provide only one or two hydroxyl groups for Ca2+ binding, single isolated galactose moieties have a low affinity for Ca2+ in aqueous solution. However, the Ca2+-galactose complex may be more stable in methanol due to the lower tendency of Ca2+ to associate with methanol than water(31.Rendleman Jr., J.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1966; 21: 209-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In GalCer, the β-conformation of the sugar and the presence of the ceramide aglycone may also modify the binding to Ca2+. The positive ion ESI mass spectrum of GalCer (monoisotopic mass 727.6) in the presence of excess Ca2+ (Fig. 1) indicates that in addition to the monomeric complex ion of GalCer with Ca2+ ([GalCer•Ca2+]2+), which is found in high abundance, the lipid forms several oligomers as well, of the general formula [nGalCer•Ca2+]2+. This behavior is similar to that of Lex-lactosylceramide(21.Siuzdak G. Ichikawa Y. Caulfield T.J. Munoz B. Wong C. Nicolau K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2877-2881Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A small amount of the Na+ complex is also present at m/z = 750.6. It is reasonable to assume that the oligomers of GalCer are formed by interaction of the carbohydrate head groups through coordination with Ca2+. As will be discussed later, the relatively higher stabilities of the oligomers, especially the dimer compared with the monomer, lend some support to this suggestion, since the coordination of hydroxyl groups from more than one carbohydrate moiety with the cation has been shown to be the preferred arrangement in the crystal structures of the Ca2+ complexes of many carbohydrates including galactose. It should also be noted that in the presence of Na+, the monomeric ion [GalCer•Na+]+ was the primary ion present in the spectrum with only trace amounts of a dimeric species, [2GalCer•Na+]+ (not shown). There was no evidence of any higher oligomers containing Na+. As will be seen later, Na+ appears to have a high affinity for GalCer to form the monomeric ion, but even in the absence of Ca2+, its ability to promote oligomerization is negligible. This supports the conclusion that the oligomers of GalCer formed in the presence of Ca2+ for the most part are not due to Van der Waals interaction between the ceramide moieties. The negative ion spectrum of GalCer in the presence of excess calcium chloride on the other hand showed predominantly a peak due to a monomeric ion at m/z = 762.4 (not shown), which was identified as [GalCer+Cl-]-. It persisted at declustering potentials of −80 to −180 V. In contrast to GalCer, CBS (monoisotopic mass 807.6) in the presence of excess Ca2+, under the same conditions as above, gives a single adduct with Ca2+ corresponding to the formula [CBS•Ca2+-H]+ (m/z = 846.6) as evident from the positive ion spectrum shown in Fig. 2. It is of lower intensity than that of the complex ions of GalCer. Neutral dimeric species of CBS anion of the type [2CBS•Ca2+-2H], although possible, would not be detected. The only ion detected in a negative ion scan was [CBS-H]- in high abundance at m/z 806.4 (not shown). Negatively charged trimers of the type [3CBS•Ca2+-3H]- have too high an m/z ratio to be detected by the mass spectrometer used. In order to detect Ca2+-mediated complex formation between GalCer and CBS, solutions containing the two lipids at a concentration of 20 nmol/ml each and Ca2+ at a concentration of 200 nmol/ml in methanol were used. The positive ion ESI mass spectrum of the mixture was acquired under similar conditions as for the individual lipids. Fig. 3 shows a representative spectrum at a declustering potential of 80 V. In addition to the Ca2+ adducts of the individual lipids as described above, there are hetero-oligomers of the two lipids detectable in the spectrum at m/z = 1170.6 ([2GalCer•CBS•2Ca2+ −2H]2+), 1211.0 ([GalCer•2CBS•2Ca2+-2H]2+), and 1574.2 ([GalCer•CBS•Ca2+-H]+). The combined intensities of the three peaks containing CBS•GalCer•Ca2+ positive ions were approximately 30% of the intensity of the [CBS•Ca2+-H]+ peak. The relative intensities of the peaks due to the hetero-oligomers were constant at concentrations of each lipid of 5-50 nmol/ml. A hetero-oligomer containing GalCer plus two CBS anions and only one Ca2+ would not be detectable since it would be neutral. The negative ion scan of the mixture of the two lipids in the presence of calcium chloride contained only two peaks due to [GalCer•Cl-]- and [CBS-H]- (not shown). It did not show any peaks resulting from the association of the two lipids. This result is not surprising in view of the fact that the negative ion spectra of the individual lipids showed no Ca2+-bound ions. The declustering potential was varied from +50 to +180 V in order to alter the collisional energy and thus the amount of complexes and oligomers. For these experiments the concentration of GalCer was kept at 20 nmol/ml, while that of CBS was increased to 50 nmol/ml. This gave a relatively more intense peak at m/z = 846.6, corresponding to [CBS•Ca2+-H]+, but had little effect on the intensity of any of the other peaks. With an increase in declustering potential, the various Ca2+ adducts of the two lipids disappear. Surprisingly, at 180 V (Fig. 4) the only Ca2+ adducts still remaining are [CBS•Ca2+-H]+ (m/z = 846.6), the homodimer of GalCer (m/z = 747.8), and the heterodimer [GalCer•CBS•Ca2+-H]+ (m/z = 1574.6). The former two ions are considerably reduced in intensity. As the declustering potential is increased from 50 to 180 V, the first Ca2+ complex of GalCer to disappear from the spectrum is the monomer [GalCer•Ca2+]2+, and the last to survive in vestigial amounts is the dimer [2GalCer•Ca2+]2+. This may allow a qualitative comparison of their stabilities to be made, the monomer being the least stable, the dimer the most stable, and other oligomers somewhere in between. Although almost all of the Ca2+ adducts of GalCer dissociated at a declustering potential of 180 V (Fig. 4), there is a high intensity peak at m/z = 750.6 due to the retention of the Na+ adduct. The new peaks at 408.2 and 348.2 are fragment ions, as confirmed by parent ion scans, indicating that under the conditions of the experiment significant fragmentation of the lipids occurs. The ratio of intensity of the heterodimer to that of the CBS monomer increases with increase in declustering potential as shown in Table 1. While it is not clear whether there is actually an increase in the abundance of the heterodimer ion with increase in declustering potential, since the intensity of the monomer shows a gradual decrease, the conclusion that the heterodimer [GalCer•CBS•Ca2+-H]+ is the most stable of all the Ca2+ adducts of either lipid, despite its low abundance, seems inescapable. The low abundance of this complex in methanol contrasts with liposome aggregation studies, which indicated that the Ca2+-mediated heterotypic aggregation of GalCer with CBS anion was greater than the Ca2+-mediated homotypic interaction of either. The polyvalent nature of liposomes compared with the monovalent lipids in solution may contribute to the greater heterotypic interaction of liposomes. This difference in behavior may also be due to the relative stability of the Ca2+ adducts of GalCer in methanol solution compared with water due to the lower ability of Ca2+ to chelate methanol compared with water(31.Rendleman Jr., J.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1966; 21: 209-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The greater solubility of galactose and other sugars in methanol containing dissolved calcium chloride than in pure methanol, in which they are virtually insoluble, is well documented (32.Domovs K.B. Freund E.H. J. Dairy Sci. 1960; 43: 1216-1223Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and also indicates the formation of Ca2+-galactose complexes in agreement with the ESI-MS results. Collision-induced decomposition of the heterodimer of GalCer and CBS was accomplished by selecting the ion at m/z = 1574.2 with the mass analyzer and allowing it to collide with argon. The resulting fragments were analyzed in the positive ion mode. Fig. 5 shows the spectrum obtained. The noncovalent dissociation of the complex should result in the formation of both components of the complex, viz. the cationized species of GalCer and CBS. The peak at m/z = 846.6 corresponding to the ion [CBS•Ca2+-H]+ is formed by the loss of GalCer (mass = 727.6) from the parent ion. No intact GalCer ions are found in the spectrum, but the ion at m/z 408.4 is its decomposition product. The collisional energy thus appears to be entirely utilized for covalent decomposition in preference to noncovalent decomposition of the complex. The occurrence of predominantly covalent dissociation of complexes under CID conditions has been interpreted as the result of the tightness of the binding of the components(21.Siuzdak G. Ichikawa Y. Caulfield T.J. Munoz B. Wong C. Nicolau K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2877-2881Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus in addition to confirming that the complex with m/z = 1574.2 is a heterodimer of GalCer and CBS with Ca2+, the CID experiment also corroborates the finding that this complex is relatively stable, since it undergoes mainly covalent decomposition. However, it is interesting to note that it is the GalCer component of the complex that appears to undergo decomposition while the CBS is unaffected. Thus based on the results of both the CID experiment and the relative tendency of different complexes to dissociate in response to increasing declustering potential, it can be concluded that the heterodimeric complex [GalCer•CBS-H•Ca2+]+ is more stable than the calcium complex of either lipid alone. In this study we have demonstrated binding of Ca2+ to each of GalCer and the anion of CBS individually. We have also demonstrated the existence of a specific interaction between GalCer and CBS anion mediated by Ca2+ as suggested by the divalent cation-mediated aggregation of phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes containing GalCer with similar liposomes containing CBS(6.Hakomori S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1991; 63: 473-482Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18.Stewart R.J. Boggs J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10666-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of GalCer, but not of CBS anion, by Ca2+ also occurred in methanol. However, the low degree of aggregation of GalCer-containing liposomes by Ca2+ compared with the greater degree of aggregation of CBS liposomes with GalCer liposomes suggests that in water this homotypic interaction must be much weaker than the heterotypic interaction and/or that the heterotypic interaction is stronger in water than in methanol. The observation of the heterotypic complex ion [GalCer•CBS•Ca2+-H]+ in the ESI mass spectrum even under conditions harsh enough to dissociate all other intermolecular clusters points to the specificity of this interaction and stability of the complex."

INTRODUCTIONApoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays an important role in many multicellular organisms, in morphogenesis, maturation of B and T lymphocytes, development of the nervous system, and destruction of unwanted cells, as well as in the pathogenesis of some diseases. A better understanding of this process could lead to development of specific inhibitors to treat apoptosis-related diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent model in which to study the genetic pathway(s) involved in apoptosis. 11 genes have been identified and implicated in apoptosis in C. elegans(1.Ellis R.E.

The functions of three of these genes are well characterized; the gene product Ced-9 prevents (2.Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R.

Since ICE functions as a cysteine protease with an absolute requirement for aspartic acid at the P1 position(17.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

In fact, the catalytic cysteine and histidine as well as the residues defining the P1 carboxylate binding pocket of ICE, as determined by the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structure, are conserved in all these Ced-3/ICE-related proteins(19.Walker N.P.C.

ICE is synthesized as a 45-kDa (p45) zymogen and is processed to generate the p20 and p10 subunits that comprise the active heterodimeric enzyme(17.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M. Casano F.J. Chin J. Ding G.J.F. Egger L.A. Gaffney E.P. Limjuco G. Palyha O.C.

Generation of the active enzyme requires four cleavages within p45 ICE (between residues 103 and 104, 119 and 120, 297 and 298, and 316 and 317). These cleavages occur between the Asp-X bonds, the primary substrate specificity of ICE itself, suggesting that conversion of p45 to its active heterodimeric form might be an autocatalytic event(17.Thornberry N.A.

The Asp residues at postions 103 and 297 in the ICE precursor are conserved in Ced-3 (residues 131 and 371 of the putative p56 Ced-3 zymogen)(6.Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), suggesting that the active form of the Ced-3 protein might also be generated by autocatalysis.We performed the studies presented here to determine protease activity of Ced-3 protein and its functional similarities to ICE. To this end, we developed an assay to detect autocatalysis of in vitro translated Ced-3 protein and used this assay together with various substrate and inhibitor studies to demonstrate that Ced-3 is an Asp-dependent cysteine protease.MATERIALS AND METHODSIn Vitro Transcription and Translation ReactionsFull-length cDNA encoding Ced-3 was kindly provided by Dr. Horvitz (MIT, Cambridge, MA). For in vitro transcription and translation, this cDNA was subcloned into a T7 polymerase promoter containing plasmid (modified pSVb, Clonetech, Palo Alto, CA). The cDNAs encoding human p45 ICE precursor (amino acids 1-404), human and murine proIL-1β, and human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were polymerase chain reaction-cloned. The polymerase chain reaction primers were designed based upon the published cDNA sequences of human ICE(21.Black, R. A., Sleath, P. R., Kronheim, S. R. (October 17, 1991) International Patent Application Wo 91/15577Google Scholar), human (22.March, C.J. Mosley, B. Larson, A. Cerretti, D.P. Braedt, G. Price, V. Gillis, S. Henney, C.S. Kronheim, S.R.

Immunol. 1986; 137: 3644-3648PubMed Google Scholar) proIL-1β, and human PARP(24.Cherney B.W. McBride O.W. Chen D. Alkhatib H. Bhatia K. Hensley P. Smulson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8370-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).The various 35S-labeled proteins were made by using a coupled transcription and translation (TNT) system (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 1 μg of DNA was added directly to TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and reactions were carried out at 30°C. For some experiments (see Fig. 3) 35S-labeled and nonlabeled wild-type (WT) Ced-3 proteins were synthesized in parallel reactions. The nonlabeled WT Ced-3 proteins were mixed with 35S-labeled C364S Ced-3 mutant or human and murine proIL-1β or human PARP at a ratio of 1:1. Control samples of 35S-labeled WT Ced-3 were mixed with fresh rabbit reticulocyte lysates at a 1:1 ratio to account for the dilution factor.Construction of C364S Ced-3 MutantThe C364S Ced-3 mutant template was generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction-based overlapping site-directed mutagenesis(25.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177Google Scholar). The internal overlapping primers used to generate the mutation of cysteine 364 to serine were 5′ mutant oligo (5′-TGCAGGCTTCTCGAGGCGAACGTCGT-3′) and 3′ mutant oligo (5′-ACGACGTTCGCCTCGAGAAGCCTGCAC-3′). The mutagenized gene was then amplified by using oligonucleotides primers that placed a SpeI site at the 5′-end (5′-GGACTAGTATGATGCGTCAAGATAGAAGG-3′) and a ClaI site at the 3′-end (5′-GGATCGATCCTCTATTAGACGGCAGAGTTTCGTGC-3′). The amplified product was digested with SpeI and ClaI and subcloned into a T7 polymerase promoter containing plasmid. The C364S Ced-3 mutant was verified by DNA sequence determination.Inhibition StudiesThe protease inhibitors iodoacetamide, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and E-64 were purchased from Sigma.

The tetrapeptide aldehyde, Ac-YVAD-CHO, a potent ICE inhibitor, is based on one of the ICE cleavage site on the proIL-1β molecule(17.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D.

Anti-apoptosis compounds acetyl-L-carnitine, zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) were obtained from Aldrich. Stock solutions of these compounds were made in the appropriate solvent, either distilled/deionized water, ethanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). Reactions ran overnight at room temperature and were analyzed on a 10-20% Tris-Tricine gradient polyacrylamide gel (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA). Bands were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSProtease Nature of Ced-3 ProteinFor functional characterization of Ced-3, we made full-length p56 Ced-3 protein using in vitro TNT reactions and collected aliquots at various time points after initiation of the reactions. As shown in Fig. 1, at time points up to 30 min, the p56 Ced-3 protein was the predominant form, but at 45, 60, and 90 min, several lower molecular weight bands (42, 40, 30, 26, 24, 18, and 10 kDa) were present. The intensity of the p56 band decreased between 30 and 90 min, while the intensity of the the lower molecular weight bands increased during the same time period. These results demonstrate that the p56 Ced-3 protein degrades when made in rabbit reticulocyte lysates.Figure 1:Kinetics of p56 Ced-3 protein synthesis and degradation after the initiation of in vitro transcription and translation reaction. Samples were removed to denaturing buffer at the indicated time points and analyzed at the completion of the experiment on a 10-20% Tris-Tricine gradient polyacrylamide gel (Integrated Separation Systems). The molecular weight size markers are indicated on the left. The arrows on the right indicate the various lower molecular weight degradation products of the p56 Ced-3 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the breakdown of the in vitro translated p56 Ced-3 protein, as shown in Fig. 1, was the result of autocatalysis of Ced-3 or an activity characteristic of the lysates, we performed the following experiments. Using the in vitro TNT reactions, we made Ced-3, human p45 ICE, and human proIL-1β proteins and incubated these proteins in the rabbit reticulocyte lysates overnight at room temperature in order to determine their stability in this assay system. The results in Fig. 2 show that unlike Ced-3, the p45 ICE and proIL-1β proteins were stable. The addition of recombinant ICE (derived from sf 9 cells infected with baculovirus encoding the ICE protein) resulted in the processing of the in vitro translated p45 ICE and proIL-1β proteins to their respective cleavage products (Fig. 2). The degradation of the p45 ICE and proIL-1β proteins, shown in Fig. 2, was therefore the result of the activity provided by active ICE, not by a nonspecific activity found in the lysates. One can infer, therefore, that the observed degradation of Ced-3 also results from specific proteolysis rather than a nonspecific activity.Figure 2:Human p45 ICE and human proIL-1β proteins made in the in vitro transcription and translation reactions do not undergo degradation. A, human p45 ICE protein incubated overnight at room temperature in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of rICE. B, human proIL-1β protein incubated overnight at room temperature in the absence (lane 3) or presence (lane 4) of rICE. C, Ced-3 protein incubated overnight at room temperature in the absence of rICE (lane 5). The arrows on the left indicate the various molecular species generated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate that the degradation of p56 Ced-3 protein was due to the proposed protease activity of Ced-3 (autocatalysis), we used a mutant called the C364S mutant, in which the putative active site cysteine, residue 364, was replaced by a serine. The results in Fig. 3A show that the TNT-synthesized C364S mutant was stable and did not generate the lower molecular weight bands, while the WT p56 Ced-3 protein did degrade, as evidenced by the presence of lower molecular weight bands. These data demonstrate that p56 Ced-3 protein degrades by autocatalysis and that cysteine 364 plays a crucial role in this proteolytic process.To determine if WT p56 Ced-3 can cleave the C364S mutant and if the products of p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis possess proteolytic activity, WT p56 Ced-3 protein (30-min TNT reaction) or products of p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis (90-min TNT reaction) were mixed with the C364S mutant protein and incubated overnight at room temperature. Both the 30- and 90-min Ced-3 reaction products cleaved the C364S mutant protein, as demonstrated by the appearance of lower molecular weight bands shown in Fig. 3A. Cleavage of C364S mutant by WT p56 Ced-3 or by the autocatalysis products of p56 Ced-3 generated the same sized bands as did autocatalysis of WT Ced-3. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the products of p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis retain proteolytic activity. Recombinant ICE (produced by baculovirus-infected sf 9 cells) also cleaved the C364S mutant protein (Fig. 3A).Proteolysis of ProIL-1β by Ced-3ICE cleaves proIL-1β at two sites. Cleavage at the first ICE site, between residues Asp-27 and Gly-28, generates a 28-kDa IL-1β fragment; cleavage at the second site, between residues Asp-116 and Ala-117, generates a 17-kDa fragment (26.Sleath P.R.

To determine if Ced-3, like ICE, can process proIL-1β, we incubated p56 Ced-3 (30-min TNT reaction) or autoprocessed Ced-3 (90-min TNT reaction) with either human or murine proIL-1β (the proIL-1βs were also made using the TNT reaction). The results in Fig. 3B demonstrate that autoprocessed Ced-3 cleaved human and murine proIL-1β to varying degrees. Autoprocessed Ced-3 cleaved human proIL-1β to a 28-kDa form (probably acting at the first ICE cleavage site), but the 17-kDa IL-1β form (the product of the second ICE cleavage) was not detected. Autoprocessed Ced-3 generated two proteolytic products, approximately 28 and 17 kDa from murine proIL-1β. In contrast, the p56 form of Ced-3 (30-min TNT reaction) did not process either human or murine proIL-1β. Incubation of p56 Ced-3 with proIL-1β prevents autocatalysis of Ced-3 and generation of the products of that reaction (data not shown). ( 2M. Hugunin, L. Quintal, and T. Ghayur, unpublished observations.) Since both p56 Ced-3 and the products of its autocatalysis process the C364S Ced-3 mutant (Fig. 3A), the results presented in Fig. 3B suggest that autoprocessed Ced-3 may have a different substrate specificity and/or higher specific activity than the p56 Ced-3 form.Proteolysis of PARP by Ced-3Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between cleavage of PARP by ICE-related proteases and apoptosis in mammalian cells as well as in isolated nuclei (12.Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2737-2742PubMed Google Scholar). Also, recently, it has been suggested that Ced-3 can cleave human PARP ((28.Xue D. Horvitz R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and see “Addendum”). Therefore, we determined if both p56 Ced-3 and products of its autocatalysis would cleave in vitro TNT PARP. The results in Fig. 3C demonstrate that both the p56 as well as the autoprocessed forms of Ced-3 cleaved full-length PARP to generate 85- and 24-kDa fragments. However, the autoprocessed form of Ced-3 (90′ TNT reaction) was more efficient at cleaving PARP than the p56 form (30′ TNT reaction). The data in Fig. 3 also demonstrate that human PARP is a better substrate for Ced-3 than human proIL-1β. A similar substrate specificity has also been demonstrated for the CPP32/YAMA/prICE.Protease Inhibition Profile of Ced-3 AutocatalysisTo determine if ICE and Ced-3 have similar protease inhibition profiles, we compared our experimentally determined profile of p56 Ced-3 with published reports of the protease inhibitor profile of ICE(17.Thornberry N.A.

The data in Fig. 4A show that the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and E-64, which do not inhibit ICE activity, also do not inhibit Ced-3 autocatalysis. On the other hand, protease inhibitors that inhibit ICE activity, such as iodoacetamide and Ac-YVAD-aldehyde(17.Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J.

That the inhibition profiles of ICE and Ced-3 are similar suggests that the catalytic specificities of the two proteins are similar and further supports the hypothesis that these proteins are functionally homologous.Figure 4:Inhibition of p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis. A, protease inhibition profile of p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis; B, effects of anti-apoptosis compounds on p56 Ced-3 autocatalysis. Wild-type p56 Ced-3 protein was made in a 30′ in vitro transcription and translation reaction. Aliquots of p56 Ced-3 protein were incubated overnight at room temperature in the absence or presence of various test compounds. Only the p56 band is shown for each lane. C, effects of various compounds at blocking autocatalytic cleavages of p56 Ced-3. Except for iodoacetamide (1000 μM), all compounds were tested at a concentration of 100 μM. D, the ability of proIL-1β- and PARP-derived tetrapeptide aldehyde inhibitors to block autocatalytic cleavages of p56 Ced-3. Leupeptin was used as an aldehyde control. All peptides were tested at a concentration of 100 μM. The arrows on the right indicate the molecular weights of autocatalytic fragments of p56 Ced-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also determined if all the autocatalytic cleavages within the Ced-3 molecule are equally sensitive to various inhibitors. The results in Fig. 4C demonstrate that ATA and iodoacetamide blocked all autocatalytic cleavages of the p56 Ced-3 for up to 16 h of incubation at room temperature. In contrast and as observed in Fig. 4, A and B, E-64 and pepstatin were completely ineffective at inhibiting Ced-3 autocatalysis.Since in vitro transcribed and translated PARP protein was cleaved more efficiently by Ced-3 than proIL-1β (Fig. 3), we tested PARP-derived peptide (Ac-DEVD-CHO; a potent inhibitor of CPP32) and proIL-1β-derived peptide (Ac-YVAD-CHO; a potent inhibitor of ICE) for their abilities to block Ced-3 autocatalysis. The results in Fig. 4D demonstrate that the two peptide aldehydes inhibited Ced-3 autocatalysis to varying degrees. Ac-DEVD-CHO blocked all autocatalytic cleavages of p56 Ced-3 for up to 16 h of incubation, whereas, in the presence of Ac-YVAD-CHO, some p56 autocatalysis was observed at 16 h postincubation. The control peptide aldehyde Ac-LLR-CHO (leupeptin) was ineffective at blocking Ced-3 autocatalysis.Anti-apoptosis Compounds and Inhibition of Ced-3 AutocatalysisSince ced-3 is required for apoptosis in C. elegans, we evaluated the effects of apoptosis inhibitors on Ced-3 autocatalysis in vitro.

Changes in the rate of B-myb gene transcription could account for part of the observed increase following serum addition. Treatment of SMC cultures with actinomycin D indicated a >4-h half-life for B-myb mRNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. Cotransfection of either a bovine or human B-myb expression vector down-regulated the activity of a multimerized MBS element-driven reporter construct in SMCs. Putative MBS elements were detected upstream of the promoters of the two chains of type I collagen, which we have found to be expressed inversely with growth state of the SMC (Kindy, M. S., Chang, C.-J., and Sonenshein, G. E.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11426-11430). In cotransfection experiments, B-myb expression down-regulated the promoter activity of α1(I) and α2(I) collagen constructs an average of 92 and 82%, respectively. Thus, B-myb represents a potential link in the observed inverse relationship between collagen gene expression and growth of vascular SMCs. The members of the Myb family of transcription factors are defined by homology in the DNA-binding domain; all bind the Myb-binding site (MBS) sequence (YG(A/G)C(A/C/G)GTT(G/A)). Here we report that cultured bovine vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) express B-myb. Levels of B-myb RNA found in exponential growth were reduced dramatically in serum-deprived quiescent SMCs; B-myb mRNA levels increased in the cell cycle during the late G1 to S phase transition following restimulation with serum, epidermal growth factor, or phorbol ester plus insulin-like growth factor-1. Changes in the rate of B-myb gene transcription could account for part of the observed increase following serum addition. Treatment of SMC cultures with actinomycin D indicated a >4-h half-life for B-myb mRNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. Cotransfection of either a bovine or human B-myb expression vector down-regulated the activity of a multimerized MBS element-driven reporter construct in SMCs. Putative MBS elements were detected upstream of the promoters of the two chains of type I collagen, which we have found to be expressed inversely with growth state of the SMC (Kindy, M. S., Chang, C.-J., and Sonenshein, G. E.(1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11426-11430). In cotransfection experiments, B-myb expression down-regulated the promoter activity of α1(I) and α2(I) collagen constructs an average of 92 and 82%, respectively. Thus, B-myb represents a potential link in the observed inverse relationship between collagen gene expression and growth of vascular SMCs. The myb oncogene was first identified as the transforming gene of two retroviruses, avian myeloblastosis virus and E26, both of which cause myeloblastic leukemia in birds (Moscovici, 1975). In nontransformed cells, high levels of c-myb mRNA are observed only in immature hematopoietic cells (Gonda and Metcalf, 1984), while lower myb levels have been detected in embryonic neural tissue as well as neuroblastoma cells and in chick embryo fibroblasts (Thiele et al., 1988; Thompson et al., 1986). We found that cultured bovine vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SMCs smooth muscle cells MBS Myb-binding site DMEM Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium FBS fetal bovine serum EGF epidermal growth factor TPA 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate IGF-1 insulin-like growth factor-1 kb kilobase(s) bp base pair(s) CAT chloramphenicol acetyltransferase TK thymidine kinase.) also express low levels of c-myb mRNA (Reilly et al., 1989; Brown et al., 1992). Two c-myb related genes have been isolated based on their high homology in the DNA-binding domains (Nomura et al., 1988; Lam et al., 1992). These genes, termed A- and B-myb, have only recently begun to be characterized. B-myb expression has been detected in many tissues (Nomura et al., 1988; Golay et al., 1991; Arsura et al., 1992, 1994). Cell synchronization studies have demonstrated that in 3T3 fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, B-myb displays a late G1-specific gene expression pattern, similar to that of c-myb (Lam et al., 1992; Golay et al., 1991; Reiss et al., 1991). Recent work has indicated that B-Myb protein is capable of binding to the consensus Myb-binding site (MBS) (YGRC(A/C/G)GTT(G/A)) (Howe and Watson, 1991), although R is preferably T/C for c-Myb and A/C for B-Myb. Furthermore, B-Myb has also been reported to recognize a second specific consensus sequence (CUNTTTCT) as well (Mizuguchi et al., 1990). The transactivation properties of B-myb are controversial, as one group reported it to function as a positive regulator (Mizuguchi et al., 1990), while several others had found it to be a transcriptional inhibitor of c-myb-mediated transactivation (Foos et al., 1992; Watson et al., 1993). These apparently contradictory findings may be due to the fact that transfected B-myb behaves differently in different cell lines (Tashiro et al., 1995). B-myb inhibited c-myb-induced transactivation in 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas activation was observed upon transfection into HeLa cells. Although no mechanism has been established for this effect, Tashiro et al.(1995) proposed that cell-specific expression of binding partner proteins allows for differential formation of a functional dimer. In addition, B-myb has also been found to transactivate the DNA polymerase α gene promoter independent of any identified MBS element (Venturelli et al., 1990; Watson et al., 1993). SMCs are the major cellular constituents of the medial layer of an artery, being responsible for maintaining vascular tone in the adult blood vessel (Ross, 1993). During the formation of a developing artery, SMCs display a synthetic phenotype; an initial highly proliferative phase is followed by synthesis of extracellular matrix components such as collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans (Hughes, 1942; Wu et al., 1992). This matrix provides a structural framework for the artery and also presumably allows for cell layering. Once the artery has been fully formed, SMCs differentiate into a contractile phenotype, in which they normally remain (Chamley-Campbell et al., 1979). As a normal response to injury and in certain disease states, however, SMCs migrate to the intimal layer, where modest rounds of proliferation are followed by production and deposition of matrix components over extended periods of time (Poole et al., 1971; Schwartz et al., 1985; Gordon et al., 1990; Ross, 1993; Strauss et al., 1994). These synthetic responses of SMCs, in association with deposition of lipids and minerals, can result in formation of an atherosclerotic plaque. SMCs grown in culture maintain a dedifferentiated synthetic phenotype. At low cell density, they proliferate rapidly, but produce little connective tissue matrix (Beldekas et al., 1982; Stepp et al., 1986). As we and others have shown, production of connective tissue proteins, such as collagen types I, III, and V, by SMCs increases dramatically as they approach confluence, when their growth slows and cells begin to form multilayers (Beldekas et al., 1982; Liau and Chan, 1989; Ang et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991). Since vascular SMCs express the c-myb oncogene, here we characterized expression of B-myb. Aortic SMCs were found to express B-myb in a cell cycle-dependent fashion; quiescent cells contained low levels of B-myb RNA, with increasing levels seen during the late G1 to S phase transition. Cotransfection of B-myb expression vectors in SMC cultures inhibited the activity of a multimerized MBS-driven heterologous promoter reporter construct and of the promoters of the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen genes, which contain putative elements for B-Myb binding. These findings suggest that B-myb, which is expressed at high levels in growing cells, may play a role in down-regulating collagen gene expression in proliferating SMCs. Smooth muscle cell explants were derived from the aortas of female calves, as we have described previously (Beldekas et al., 1982). Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was changed every 2-3 days, and cells were not used beyond the fourth passage. SMC cultures were synchronized as described previously (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986). Briefly, cells were plated at low density (5 × 105 cells/150-mm2 dish) and allowed to grow exponentially for 3 days, at which time the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Cells were maintained in 0.5% FBS for 3 days to achieve quiescence, at which time the cells were then stimulated with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. With this procedure (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986), we have found that only 1-2% of SMCs deprived of serum for 72 h demonstrate significant [3H]thymidine nuclear labeling. Serum stimulation results in an increase in labeled nuclei at 12 h, indicating the beginning of DNA synthesis, with percent nuclear labeling increasing to 95% after 20 h of serum stimulation (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986; Brown et al., 1992). Levels of histone H3.2 mRNA, an S phase-specific gene, and cytofluorometric measurements further confirmed cell synchrony (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986). Alternatively, serum-deprived cells were stimulated with either 20 ng/ml EGF or 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the absence or presence of 35 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) cDNA constructs employed were as follows: α1(I) collagen, pCg54, a chicken cDNA clone (Lehrach et al., 1979); α1(V) collagen, pTV302, a human cDNA clone (Takahara et al., 1991); B-myb, λ-B-myb, a human cDNA clone (Nomura et al., 1988); histone H3.2, pRAH3.2, a genomic fragment encoding amino acids 57-125 of histone H3.2 (Alterman et al., 1984); and ornithine decarboxylase, murine cDNA clone pOD48 (McConlogue et al., 1984). A bovine B-myb cDNA plasmid expression vector, pB14, was isolated from a custom cDNA library, constructed by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), in λ-ZAP-EXPRESS using poly(A+) RNA from exponentially growing aortic SMCs. The 3.4-kb insert of pB14 was the largest isolated in the screening and represents a nearly full-length cDNA based on the 3.5-kb B-myb mRNA size estimate. Partial DNA sequence information of a PstI fragment of pB14 subcloned into the Bluescript vector, obtained by double-stranded sequencing with Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), indicated homology of >84% to the human B-myb sequences (bp 1755-1941) (Nomura et al., 1988), analyzed using the Blast program (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The human B-myb expression vector pCEP-B-myb contains the BamHI fragment, including the entire coding region of the B-myb gene from plasmid pATB-18 (Arsura et al., 1992), subcloned into the pCEP4β plasmid expression vector (Invitrogen). The reporter plasmid KHK-CAT-dAX was derived by insertion of nine copies of the MBS directly in front of the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene in dAX-TK-CAT (Ibanez and Lipsick, 1990). The vector dAX-TK-CAT was in turn constructed from pBLCAT2 by deletion of the AatII polylinker (XhoI) fragment from the pUC18 plasmid backbone, which appeared to confer a low level of myb-induced transcription activity apparently caused by cryptic MBS elements (Ibanez and Lipsick, 1990). The vector p1.6Bgl-CAT contains bp −1114 to +513 of the murine c-myc gene linked to the CAT reporter construct as described previously (Duyao et al., 1992). pHNmyb-CAT contains 1 kb of sequence upstream of the start site of transcription of the human c-myb promoter and 1.1 kb of exon 1 cloned into the pSV0CAT vector (kindly provided by T. Bender, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA). The pMS-3.5/CAT construct contains bp −3500 to +58 of the human α2(I) promoter upstream of the CAT reporter gene (Boast et al., 1990). The plasmid pOB3.6 contains 3.5 kb of the rat α1(I) collagen promoter plus the first exon and first intron linked to the CAT reporter (Bedalov et al., 1994). The plasmid ColCAT3.6 is composed of a 3.6-kb fragment containing 3.5 kb of sequence upstream of the start site of transcription and 115 bp of the first exon of the rat α1(I) collagen gene linked to the CAT reporter (Lichtler et al., 1989). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/100-mm2 dish 24 h before transfection. The medium was changed 2-4 h before transfection. DNA (50 μg) was transfected by the modified CaPO4 transfection procedure of Chen and Okayama(1987). Cells were harvested 48-72 h after transfection, and lysates were prepared as described previously (Lawrence et al., 1994a). Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using the Bradford assay as directed by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total protein were incubated with 2.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl coenzyme A (DuPont NEN; 200 mCi/mmol), 50 μM acetyl coenzyme A, and 1.6 mM chloramphenicol for 4-8 h, and the acetylated forms were extracted with ethyl acetate and assayed by liquid scintillation counting (Lawrence et al., 1994a). Total cellular RNA was isolated according to the method of Chirgwin et al. (1979) or with Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Equal quantities of RNA (15-25 μg) were denatured and separated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Separated RNA was transferred onto a GeneScreen Plus nylon membrane (DuPont NEN). RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene) at 0.12 J/cm2 for 30 s. For RNA stability studies, cells were treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Boehringer Mannheim). Probes were prepared as described previously by Feinberg and Vogelstein(1982); hybridization reactions contained 1-2 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA/ml of buffer. Unhybridized probe was removed by washing blots at 68°C with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 30 min, followed by 15-30 min washes with 1 and 0.5 × SSC, as needed. Quantitation by scanning densitometry was performed using a Molecular Dynamics 300A computing densitometer. Nuclei were isolated from SMCs, and run-off analysis was performed by a modification of the method of Greenberg and Ziff(1984). Briefly, ~1 × 107 nuclei were incubated in the presence of 250 μCi of [32P]UTP (DuPont NEN; 3200 Ci/mmol) for 30 min at 30°C. Labeled RNA was isolated, and equal amounts of radiolabeled RNA (4.5 × 106 cpm/ml of hybridization buffer) were hybridized to plasmid DNA (10 μg/sample) immobilized onto GeneScreen Plus by slot blotting followed by UV irradiation; after hybridization, blots were washed as described above. Expression of B-myb in hematopoietic cells and 3T3 fibroblasts has been shown to be cell cycle-regulated, with increasing levels detected during the G1 to S phase transition (Golay et al., 1991; Lam et al., 1992). To determine whether aortic SMCs express B-myb, Northern blot analysis was performed using RNA isolated from bovine aortic SMCs synchronized using the serum deprivation-stimulation protocol described previously (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986; see “Materials and Methods”). Serum-deprived quiescent cells begin to enter S phase ~12 h after serum stimulation, and DNA synthesis peaks between 16 and 20 h (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986). RNA was isolated from SMCs in exponential growth, in quiescence, and at various times following serum restimulation. Using a human B-myb cDNA clone as a probe, Northern blot analysis revealed that exponentially growing SMCs express significant quantities of an ~3.5-kb B-myb mRNA (Fig. 1). In contrast, very low levels of B-myb RNA were seen in quiescent SMCs, and RNA levels remained low until 8 h after serum stimulation. Between 8 and 14 h of serum stimulation, levels of B-myb RNA began to increase and continued to do so until 24 h after serum stimulation. The level of B-myb mRNA increased ~6-8-fold during this time as judged by densitometric scanning. Entry into S phase between 12 and 16 h was verified using incorporation of [3H]thymidine and appearance of histone H3.2 mRNA as described previously (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986) (data not shown). Therefore, B-myb is expressed in bovine aortic SMCs in a cell cycle-dependent manner. B-myb RNA levels are low in quiescence, increase in the mid to late G1 phase of the cell cycle, immediately prior to the onset of DNA synthesis, and continue to increase throughout S phase. To determine whether transcriptional control mechanisms play a role in the increase in steady-state B-myb RNA levels, nuclear run-off analysis was performed. Nuclei were isolated from cells shortly after serum stimulation (0.5 h), to allow adequate time for protein synthesis to recover from the low levels in quiescent cells, and at 12 and 18 h after serum stimulation, to compare transcription rates in late G1 and mid S phase. Hybridization to the B-myb probe increased significantly between 0.5 and 12 h and remained constant between 12 and 18 h (Fig. 2). In two separate experiments, an ~1.6-2-fold increase was seen. In contrast, transcription of the α1 chains of collagen types I and V decreased between 12 and 18 h and between 0.5 and 12 h, respectively. Transcription of ornithine decarboxylase and histone H3.2 increased by 12 h, as expected (McConlogue et al., 1984; Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986). These results indicate that there is an increase in the rate of B-myb gene transcription during the cell cycle; this increase can account for a part of the increase in steady-state RNA levels seen by Northern analysis. To assess the half-life of B-myb mRNA, the rate of decay of B-myb RNA was determined following addition of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D to SMCs in S phase. At 18 h after serum stimulation, cells were treated for 1-4 h with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, which we have found effectively inhibits RNA synthesis (Kindy and Sonenshein, 1986). No decay of B-myb RNA was observed even after 4 h of actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 3). In contrast, levels of the S phase-expressed histone H3.2 mRNA, which were significant at 18 h, decayed substantially during this treatment, consistent with results obtained previously (Brown et. al., 1992). Therefore, B-myb mRNA appears relatively stable at the time points where substantial steady-state levels are present. We next investigated the ability of specific growth factors to induce expression of B-myb RNA. Subconfluent SMC cultures were made quiescent via serum deprivation and were then stimulated with addition of 20 ng/ml EGF. This growth factor is a weak mitogen for subconfluent SMCs, as evidenced by the appearance of histone H3.2 mRNA, which was detectable by 24 h (Fig. 4). EGF treatment resulted in a low level of induction of B-myb mRNA that began to be detectable at 12 h and was clearly seen at 24 h (Fig. 4). Thus, expression of B-myb RNA was inducible by EGF and appeared to precede entry into S phase, consistent with the G1/S-phase specific nature of the B-myb expression observed above. Phorbol ester treatment of quiescent cells has been found to induce genes mediating competence, such as c-fos and c-myc, and entry into the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Greenberg and Ziff, 1984; Kelly et al., 1983). Further transit from G1 into S phase requires stimulation with a progression factor, such as IGF-1 (Leof et al., 1982). To examine the effects of these agents on SMCs, serum-deprived quiescent cell cultures were stimulated with 100 nM TPA in the absence or presence of 35 ng/ml IGF-1. RNA was isolated from cells in quiescence (0 h) or 10, 16, and 24 h after stimulation. B-myb RNA levels were low in quiescence (Fig. 5), as observed above (Fig. 1). No significant increase in B-myb expression was seen with TPA treatment alone. In contrast, B-myb RNA levels increased in the cells treated with both TPA and IGF-1. Thus, treatment with TPA made SMCs competent to respond to the progression factor IGF-1, leading to increased expression of B-myb. Previously, we had shown that the reporter plasmid KHK-CAT-dAX, derived by insertion of nine copies of the MBS directly in front of the TK promoter linked to the CAT gene in the plasmid dAX-TK-CAT, was transcriptionally active in SMCs (Brown et al., 1992). To begin to assess the specific functional role of B-myb in transactivational control in the vascular SMC, a 3.4-kb bovine pB14 B-myb cDNA clone, in the pBK-CMV plasmid expression vector, was isolated from an aortic SMC cDNA library and used in cotransfection experiments. SMC cultures, at ~50% confluence, were cotransfected with the KHK-CAT-dAX reporter construct and increasing amounts of pB14 expression vector. After 3 days, extracts were prepared, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed. B-myb expression resulted in dose-dependent down-regulation of KHK-CAT-dAX activity, with a maximal decrease of ~2.5-fold or 60% (Fig. 6). An average of three separate experiments yielded a drop in activity of 60.3 ± 3.7%. In contrast, pB14 had no effect on the activity of parental dAX-TK-CAT. Cotransfection with 12 μg of pB14 only reduced dAX-TK-CAT activity to 92.0 ± 4.0% of control in two separate experiments (data not shown). Cotransfection of 5 μg of a human pCEP-B-myb expression vector similarly resulted in a specific down-regulation of the activity of KHK-CAT-dAX (65%; data not shown). Thus, expression of B-Myb leads to repression of the transcriptional activity of an MBS element-driven heterologous promoter in SMCs. Previously, we had noted that type I collagen mRNA levels varied inversely with the growth state of the vascular SMC (Stepp et al., 1986; Kindy et al., 1988). Levels of type I collagen mRNA were low in actively proliferating SMCs and increased in quiescence due to either serum deprivation or growth to confluence. Since bovine B-myb appeared to be a negative regulator of transcription, we analyzed the promoters of the type I collagen genes and identified several putative MBS elements in both the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen (see “Discussion”). Thus, cotransfection experiments were performed to test the effects of B-myb expression on collagen promoter activity. Increasing concentrations of pB14 were cotransfected with the α2(I) collagen promoter pMS-3.5/CAT construct, which contains 3.5 kb of sequence upstream of the start site of transcription and 58 bp of exon 1 driving the CAT reporter gene (Boast et al., 1990). The activity of the pMS-3.5/CAT vector was down-regulated 3.8-fold (72%) upon cotransfection with 10 μg of bovine B-myb vector (Fig. 7A). An average decrease of 82 ± 10.8% was noted in three experiments upon cotransfection with 10 μg of pB14 DNA. Cotransfection with a human B-myb expression vector similarly down-regulated the activity of the α2(I) promoter (Fig. 7B). The significance of the differences in the slopes of the two curves is unclear given the differences in the expression vectors used. An ~4-fold (73%) down-regulation was observed with 2.5 μg of human B-myb expression vector. Thus, B-myb, either bovine or human, inhibits the activity of the α2(I) collagen promoter in SMCs. The expression of the α1 and α2 genes of type I collagen is often coordinately regulated (Stepp et al., 1986). Therefore, we assessed the effects of B-Myb expression on the activity of the α1(I) promoter. pOB3.6, which contains 3.6 kb of the α1(I) collagen promoter plus all of exon 1 and intron 1 upstream of the CAT reporter gene, was cotransfected with the bovine B-myb expression vector pB14. The activity of pOB3.6 was down-regulated ~8.8-fold, in a dose-dependent manner, by coexpression of B-myb (Fig. 8). Cotransfection with 10 μg of bovine pB14 reduced pOB3.6 activity an average of 92 ± 2.5% in three experiments, and that with 10 μg of human pCEP-B-myb expression vector reduced it 79% (data not shown). The plasmid ColCAT3.6, which contains 3.5 kb of the α1(I) collagen promoter plus 115 bp of exon 1 upstream of the CAT reporter gene, displayed fairly low levels of CAT activity in SMCs (data not shown). This activity was similarly down-regulated by the presence of either human or bovine B-myb, but to a somewhat lesser extent, 57 ± 2.4% (data not shown). Therefore, B-Myb is a specific regulator of transcription that is able to down-regulate the activity of the promoters of the genes encoding both chains of type I collagen. To determine whether B-myb acts nonspecifically as a negative regulator of transcription in SMCs, cotransfection analysis was performed with the c-myc and c-myb promoters, both of which contain MBSs that have been shown to be regulated by c-Myb (Evans et al., 1990; Nakagoshi et al., 1992; Nicolaides et al., 1991). Cotransfection of 5 μg of pB14 with the c-myc promoter plasmid p1.6Bgl-CAT resulted in only an ~15% reduction in its activity. These results agree with those of Watson et al.(1993), who found that B-myb had no effect on c-myc promoter activity in 3T3 fibroblasts. Similarly, the activity of the c-myb promoter plasmid pHNmyb-CAT was down-regulated only 12% upon cotransfection with B-myb. Thus, B-myb expression did not appear to significantly affect the promoter activity of these two oncogenes, suggesting that the inhibition of collagen promoter activity described above is specific. Proliferating primary bovine aortic SMCs were found to express B-myb, a member of the myb gene family. B-myb expression in SMCs occurred in a cell cycle-dependent fashion and displayed negative regulatory activity with respect to an MBS element-driven construct and the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen promoters. Quiescent SMCs expressed very little B-myb mRNA, and levels increased as cells entered late G1 and peaked in S phase following stimulation with serum, EGF, or a combination of treatment with TPA and IGF-1. Previous work in several laboratories, including our own, demonstrated an inverse relationship between SMC growth and collagen production (Jones et al., 1979; Stepp et al., 1986; Kindy et al., 1988; Liau and Chan, 1989; Ang et al., 1990; Chang and Sonenshein, 1991). When SMCs were proliferating rapidly, collagen gene expression was low, whereas when they were confluent or made quiescent via either serum starvation or isoleucine deprivation, collagen mRNA expression increased significantly. The findings presented here suggest the intriguing possibility that B-Myb mediates signals regulating this inverse relationship between growth and collagen gene expression in SMCs; furthermore, they indicate that collagen genes represent a new family of targets for regulation by a member of the myb gene family. When transfected into aortic SMCs, bovine B-myb negatively regulated an MBS element/heterologous promoter-driven construct. Thus, the overexpression of B-myb can apparently override, presumably via competition for binding, the induction of MBS element activity by the low level of endogenously expressed c-myb previously noted in these cells (Brown et al., 1992). This is similar to results obtained in other cell types with the human and murine homologs of B-myb. In 3T3 cells, for example, murine B-myb has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of c-myb-induced transactivation of an MBS-driven construct (Watson et al., 1993). GAL4 fusion studies have also shown that the C terminus of murine B-Myb has no intrinsic ability to transactivate when fused with the DNA-binding domain of the GAL4 protein. This lack of transactivating ability is not due simply to lack of DNA binding by B-Myb since gel shift and footprinting studies have shown that B-Myb was able to bind to an MBS. Recently, it has been shown that B-Myb is able to function as a strong transcriptional activator when transfected into certain cell types, such as HeLa cells (Tashiro et al., 1995). It has been postulated that this cell type specificity relates to the absence or presence of a cofactor that binds to B-Myb in its C-terminal conserved region and mediates transactivation. The selective down-regulation of the activity of the promoters for the two chains of type I collagen upon B-myb expression in transient cotransfection analysis in primary cultured SMCs may occur by either a direct or an indirect mechanism. DNA analysis of the rat and human collagen COL1A1 and A2 genes revealed the presence of several putative Myb-binding sites and B-Myb-specific sequence elements. The presence of these putative sites raises the possibility of a direct effect of B-Myb on collagen genes. The limited size of these sequences, however, necessitates more specific mapping analysis. It should also be noted that indirect mechanisms have been observed, e.g. with the DNA polymerase α promoter (Venturelli et al., 1990; Watson et al., 1993); these could similarly be involved with the down-regulation of transcription of collagen genes via expression of B-Myb and would be of equal functional significance for matrix formation by the SMC. We have recently found that co-microinjection of B-myb with c-myc expression vectors into quiescent SMCs failed to induce entry into S phase, suggesting that the observed inhibition of collagen gene transcription is not simply due to a change in the proliferative state of the cell. ( 2D. Marhamati, R. Bellas, M. Arsura, and G. E. Sonenshein, manuscript in preparation.) The 6-8-fold increase in B-myb mRNA seen in the cell cycle can be partly accounted for by the 1.6-2-fold increase in the overall rate of transcription of the gene. In 3T3 fibroblasts, the mechanism of the cell cycle increase in B-myb RNA levels was determined to be due to an increase in the rate of transcription of the gene. Deletion of an E2F site abrogated cell cycle regulation of B-myb transcription (Lam and Watson, 1993). Gel shift analysis revealed that quiescent cells showed E2F binding that was supershifted only with antibodies to E2F and p107, while in S phase, this complex contained cyclin A as well. It is possible that other mechanisms play a significant role in B-myb expression in SMCs. Alternative levels of control include either a change in the rate of elongation of RNA chains during synthesis or of RNA processing or altered stability. For example, c-myb mRNA levels in hematopoietic cells are controlled mainly by the rate of elongation of transcription (Bender et al., 1987), while in chick embryo fibroblasts, mRNA stability is the main level of regulation (Thompson et al., 1986). Interestingly, the increase in c-myb mRNA levels in SMCs during the late G1 to S phase transition could not be accounted for either by an enhanced rate of gene transcription or by a change in the stability of the c-myb RNA (Brown et al., 1992), suggesting additional levels of control. The observation that there is an inverse relationship between matrix deposition and cellular proliferation is a long standing one that has been substantiated in many different systems. For example, viral transformation of fibroblasts enhanced the proliferative capacity of these cells while decreasing their level of synthesis of type I collagen (Adams et al., 1982). Overexpression of the ras oncogene in Rat1 fibroblasts had a similar affect on type I collagen gene expression by these cells (Slack et al., 1992). In density-arrested nondividing human fetal lung fibroblasts, type I and III collagen mRNA levels were significantly higher than those in logarithmically growing cells (Miskulin et al., 1986). Thus, it appears that when genes necessary for growth, such as oncogenes, are expressed, other genes that are inconsistent with or unnecessary for growth are turned off. The fact that B-myb is expressed broadly in many different cell types presents the possibility that the signal transduction pathway that mediates activation of this gene may be involved in the inhibition of collagen gene expression in cells derived from many different tissues. SMCs are responsible for synthesizing the extracellular matrix components in the medial layer of a normal artery, including collagen, elastin, fibronectin, and proteoglycans, as well as the enzymes involved in matrix protein deposition, such as lysyl oxidase (reviewed by Ross(1993)). During arterial development in the chick, an initial SMC synthetic phase is followed by deposition of matrix proteins and additional cell layering (Hughes, 1942; Wu et al., 1992). The most abundant collagen species produced by SMCs is type I collagen, with lesser but still significant amounts of collagen types III, V, and VI. In atherosclerosis, SMCs migrate from the medial layer to the intima, where some initial rounds of proliferation are followed by extensive synthesis and deposition of matrix proteins (Poole et al., 1971; Gordon et al., 1990; Ross, 1993; Strauss et al., 1994). The majority of the mass of a fibrous plaque is composed of the collagen proteins deposited by the SMC. The subsequent occlusion of the lumen of the artery and the clinical sequelae that follow are a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. Coordinate regulation of many collagen species, including types I, III, and V, has been noted in SMC cultures under a variety of conditions that affect growth state (Jones et al., 1979; Stepp et al., 1986; Liau and Chan, 1989; Ang et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1991; Lawrence et al., 1994b). In addition, other genes necessary for matrix deposition, such as lysyl oxidase, have similar inverse expression patterns in relation to growth (Kenyon et al., 1991). Thus, the possibility that B-Myb plays a more general role in regulation of matrix gene expression in SMCs is under investigation. We thank Drs.

In the presence of phospholipid and 5 mM Ca2+, the activities of variant and normal plasma-derived factor IX are similar; however, in the presence of activated factor VIIIa (intrinsic tenase complex), the normal augmentation of the cleavage of the specific substrate of factor IX, factor X, is not observed. The determination of the association constants for normal and variant factor IXa with factor VIIIa shows that the affinity of the activated variant factor IX for the cofactor factor VIIIa is 172-fold lower than normal.

The study of the homodimeric, cooperative hemoglobin from the clam Scapharca inaequivalvis, HbI, ( 1The abbreviations used are: HbI dimeric S. inaequivalvis hemoglobin HbA human hemoglobin A PR polarization ratio.) has suggested a mechanism of cooperativity in oxygen binding that is radically different from that operative in HbA. The mechanism is based on the comparison of the deoxy- and liganded HbI crystal structures, determined in orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals, respectively, and entails prominent tertiary changes in the heme environment but only subtle quaternary changes(1.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21052-21061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E.

Communication between the heme groups via localized structural changes is made possible by the unusual assembly of the globin chains. In HbI, the heme-carrying E and F helices form the dimer interface (5.Royer Jr., W.E. Love W.E. Fenderson F.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) rather than being exposed to solvent as in HbA. Thereby, the heme groups are brought into nearly direct contact through a network of hydrogen bonds, which is modified upon oxygenation(2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3.Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4.Condon P.J. Royer Jr., W.E. J.

In order to establish whether the crystal structures of HbI fully correlate with function in solution, we asked the question whether cooperative oxygen binding is retained by the protein in the crystalline state. In fact, it cannot be excluded, a priori, that crystallization conditions favor a protein conformation different from that prevailing in solution and that lattice interactions restrict its activity-related movements. The functional behavior has been commonly used as a stringent criterion to compare structural properties of proteins in solution and in the crystalline state(6.Rupley J.A. Timasheff S.N. Fasman G.D.

The response of crystals of human hemoglobin A (HbA) to oxygenation exemplifies the delicate interplay between intramolecular rearrangements associated with ligand binding and intermolecular interactions stabilizing the crystal. Deoxy-HbA crystals, grown from high salt solutions, shatter in the presence of oxygen(10.Haurowitz F. Z. Physiol. Chem. 1938; 234: 266-274Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11.Perutz M.F. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 859-864Crossref Google Scholar), as lattice interactions neither prevent nor accommodate the T → R quaternary transition(12.Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol.

In contrast, deoxy-HbA crystals, grown from polyethylene glycol solutions, are stable when exposed to oxygen because the protein remains in the T quaternary state with intact salt bridges(14.Brzozowski A.

A single crystal polarized absorption microspectrophotometric study has shown that oxygen binds noncooperatively to these crystals, saturating both α and β hemes (17.Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similar studies have been carried out on stable crystals of Hb Rothschild (19.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Kwiatkowski L. Wierzba A.M. Noble R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6411-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and des-Arg HbA(20.Kavanaugh J.S. Chafin D.R. Arnone A. Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C.

Single-crystal polarized absorption microspectrophotometry is here exploited to determine oxygen binding curves to HbI crystals grown in the deoxy state. To obtain a precise estimate of the fractional saturation of reduced hemes, it is critical to evaluate exactly the amount of HbI molecules present in the oxidized form. The spectrum of soluble HbI in the oxidized state is pH-dependent and reflects an equilibrium distribution between two high spin dimeric components and a low spin monomeric hemichrome(21.Spagnuolo C. De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this equilibrium has been characterized in the crystalline state. Scapharca inaequivalvis HbI was isolated and purified as described previously(22.Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Crystals of deoxy HbI were grown at room temperature by mixing deoxygenated 5 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 22 mg/ml HbI, and deoxygenated 3.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, as measured after calibration of the electrode with the standards 48 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 10. The final solution contained 30 mM sodium dithionite. Crystallization vials were deoxygenated and stored anaerobically. Crystals of size suitable for microspectrophotometric measurements (10-30 μm thick) grew in 1.8-2.0 M phosphate buffer as rhombic plates, belonging to the orthorhombic space group C2221, ( 2W. E. Royer, Jr., personal communication.) like the larger deoxy-HbI crystals grown for x-ray studies(2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3.Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Individual crystals of deoxy HbI were withdrawn from a crystallization vial and were washed at least 6 times in 3.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.35 mg/ml (20 units/μg) catalase (Sigma, bovine liver), in air. No crystal damage was observed during this procedure. Crystals were placed in a Dvorak-Stotler flow cell (23.Dvorak J.A. Stotler W.F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1971; 68: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and covered with an optically isotropic, gas permeable, silicon-copolymer membrane, MEM213 (General Electric). Helium-oxygen humidified gas mixtures were prepared with a computerized gas standard generator (Environics, series 200) and flown into the cell using 316 stainless steel tubing. Oxygen pressure at the outlet of the cell was determined by an oxygen meter equipped with a Clark electrode. The flow cell was mounted on the thermostatted stage of a Zeiss MPM03 microspectrophotometer. Single crystal polarized absorption spectra were recorded between 450 and 700 nm. The electric vector of the incident polarized light was parallel either to the a or to the b crystal axis. These axes coincide with the diagonals of the plate and are principal optical directions of the crystal. Polarized light absorption along these directions obeys the Beer-Lambert law. The optical theory for myoglobin and hemoglobin crystals has been previously reported(18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24.Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Oxygen binding curves were determined by recording polarized absorption spectra of HbI crystals equilibrated with either progressively increasing or progressively decreasing oxygen pressures, at 15°C, as described previously(17.Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The time required to obtain a stable spectrum of oxygenated HbI crystals depends on crystal thickness and oxygen pressure. For oxygen pressures below 2 torr, equilibration times for HbI crystals suitable for microspectrophotometric studies are of the order of days, and oxygen electrode drift precludes measurements. Long equilibration times also cause the unavoidable formation of oxidized HbI. For these reasons, even at higher oxygen pressures, each crystal was used for no more than three measurements. Oxidation of HbI crystals was achieved by suspending them in a solution containing 3.5 M potassium phosphate and 2 mM potassium ferricyanide for about 30 min. Polarized absorption spectra of oxidized HbI crystals were recorded after suspending the same crystal in 3.5 M potassium phosphate at different pH values. Concentrated oxy-HbI in a solution containing 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was oxidized with potassium ferricyanide dissolved in the same buffer. The oxidized protein was subsequently concentrated to 4 × 10-3M (heme) with an Amicon Centricon 10 apparatus, thus eliminating the excess ferricyanide and the ferrocyanide formed during the redox reaction. The concentrated HbI solution was mixed in different ratios with 4 M potassium phosphate buffer, at pH values between 6.3 and 8.5, to yield a final phosphate concentration of 1-3 M. Absorption spectra were recorded between 450 and 700 nm by using a Varian Cary 3 spectrophotometer, at 15°C. The pH of each solution was measured after spectral recording. It was not possible to determine spectra in the presence of phosphate concentrations higher than 3 M and of protein concentrations higher than 1 × 10-3M, nor to oxidize concentrated HbI in a high ionic strength buffer, due to protein precipitation. Fractions of deoxygenated, oxygenated, and oxidized hemes in HbI crystals were determined by a least squares fitting of the polarized spectra recorded in the presence of various oxygen pressures to a linear combination of deoxy-, oxy-, and oxidized HbI polarized spectra (reference spectra)(17.Mozzarelli A. Rivetti C. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Spectra of crystals containing oxidized HbI in proportions higher than 20% were not used for oxygen affinity determinations. The pH-dependent absorption spectra of oxidized HbI in solution were analyzed with a singular value decomposition algorithm (Matlab, The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA) and fitted according to the equilibrium scheme given by Spagnuolo et al.(21.Spagnuolo C. De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which describes the pH-dependent interconversion of three components, a dimeric hexacoordinate, a dimeric pentacoordinate, and a monomeric hemichrome. The pH-dependent polarized absorption spectra of oxidized HbI in the crystal were fitted to a linear combination of the basis spectra of the three oxidized species in solution. The contributions of the different components to the observed polarized spectra Aobs were calculated by the following expression: Aobs=cDh×ADh+cDp×ADp+cM×AM+coff×Aoff(Eq. 1) where ADh, ADp, and AM are the basis spectra in solution of the dimeric hexacoordinate, dimeric pentacoordinate, and monomeric hemichrome, respectively, and cDh, cDp, and cM are coefficients proportional to both the fractional concentration of the various species and their extinction coefficients along each crystal axis. coff × Aoff represents a horizontal offset. The use of the above expression is justified by the observation that the ratio of absorbances at each wavelength in the two perpendicular directions of polarization is almost constant, i.e. the electronic transitions are almost perfectly x, y polarized(18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24.Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Single crystal polarized absorption spectra of HbI, recorded along the a and the b crystallographic axes, at oxygen pressures between 2 and 37 torr, at 15°C (Fig. 1), indicate that HbI crystals bind oxygen reversibly and that oxygenation does not lead to crystal damage. In order to determine the fraction of oxygenated, deoxygenated, and oxidized hemes at different oxygen pressures, polarized absorption spectra of pure deoxy-, oxy-, and oxidized HbI (reference spectra) were obtained using the same crystal. First, a ferrous HbI crystal was fully oxidized by suspending it in a solution containing 2 mM potassium ferricyanide. Upon oxidation, fine crystal cracks transiently appear on the crystal surface. Thereafter, excess reagent was removed, and polarized spectra were recorded (Fig. 2a). The oxidized HbI crystal was then reduced by resuspending it in a solution containing 30 mM sodium dithionite, and spectra were recorded (Fig. 2b). Finally, the crystal was washed with a dithionite-free solution equilibrated with oxygen at a pressure of 760 torr. Polarized spectra were recorded and corrected for the presence of small amounts of oxidized protein (Fig. 2c). Since no appreciable spectral differences were observed by comparing spectra recorded at 160 and 760 torr, these spectra represent the absorption of fully oxygenated HbI crystals. An example of the least-squares fitting of the observed spectra in the presence of 5.5 torr of oxygen to a linear combination of the reference spectra and an offset is shown in Fig. 2d.Figure 2:Single crystal polarized absorption spectra and polarization ratios of deoxy-HbI, oxy-HbI and oxidized HbI (reference spectra). The spectra of oxidized HbI were recorded on a crystal, oxidized with 2 mM ferricyanide and then washed with 3.5 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.5 (panel a); the spectra of deoxy-HbI were obtained by suspending the same crystal in 30 mM dithionite (panel b); the spectra of oxy-HbI were obtained by resuspending the crystal, after removal of dithionite, in a solution equilibrated at 760 torr of oxygen (panel c). The contribution of a small fraction of oxidized HbI to the oxy-HbI spectra, as evidenced by a shoulder at 602 nm, was subtracted, and the spectra were properly normalized as described previously(18.Rivetti C. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Henry E. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2888-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For each set of spectra, the polarization ratio is plotted on the top portion of each panel. In panel d, the observed polarized spectrum, recorded with the electric vector parallel to the a crystal axis, at an oxygen pressure of 5.5 torr (-), is compared with that calculated from the fitting to a linear combination of the reference spectra(- - -), the fractional contribution of the spectra of deoxyHbI, oxyHbI, and oxidized HbI being 42.5, 50.1, and 7.4%, respectively. The fractional saturation with oxygen, defined as the ratio of oxygenated hemes over reduced plus oxygenated hemes, is 54.5%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hill plots of the data are shown in Fig. 3. The oxygen pressure required for half-saturation (p50) is 4.9 ± 1.0 and 4.8 ± 0.8 torr, as determined from spectra recorded along the a and the b crystal axes, respectively. The Hill coefficient (nH) determined from the two sets of data is 1.43 ± 0.07 and 1.46 ± 0.06, respectively. In solution, at 15.1°C, in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, the p50 for HbI is 5.7 torr and the Hill coefficient is 1.44(26.Ikeda-Saito M. Yonetani T. Chiancone E. Ascoli F. Verzili D. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Polarized absorption spectra of hemoglobin crystals provide information on the heme orientation in different ligation states(24.Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 511-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The pertinent parameter is the polarization ratio (PR), i.e. the ratio of the absorbances in two perpendicular directions at wavelengths where the electronic transitions are almost perfectly x, y polarized. A good estimate of PR can be obtained by calculating the ratio of absorbances at 556 nm for deoxy-HbI and at 542 nm for oxy-HbI. The PR values (Aa/Ab) are 1.79 and 1.81 for deoxy- and oxy-HbI, respectively (Table 1), indicating that oxygen binding is not accompanied by a heme tilt. This result is in agreement with the crystallographic finding that hemes have the same orientation in deoxy-HbI (2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as in CO-HbI (1.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. J. Biol.

For both sets of data, the pH-dependent spectral changes were analyzed in terms of three components, the hexacoordinate aquomet, the pentacoordinate species, and the hemichrome. Representative examples are given in Fig. 4, c and d. The most striking differences concern the monomeric hemichrome, which is practically absent in the crystalline state over the entire pH range examined (Fig. 5a). Thus, in the crystal, the spectra are a combination of the spectra of the pentacoordinate and the hexacoordinate dimeric species, with the latter component varying between 70 and 35% at pH values between 6.3 and 8.5. The contribution of the aquomet hexacoordinate species to absorption is consistently higher in the spectra recorded with light polarized along the b crystal axis, a result suggesting that in the two oxidized species, the hemes are differently oriented with respect to the crystal axes.Figure 5:Dependence on pH and phosphate concentration of the fraction of high spin aquomet, high spin pentacoordinate, and low spin hemichrome for crystalline and soluble oxidized HbI. The fractions of high spin hexacoordinate (▵, ▴), high spin pentacoordinate (○, •), and low spin hemichrome (□, ◼) species were calculated by a linear combination of the basis spectra as described under “Materials and Methods”. Panel a, crystalline HbI; open and closed symbols refer to data recorded along the a and b crystal axes, respectively. Panel b, soluble HbI in 1 M phosphate buffer. Panel c, soluble HbI in phosphate buffer, pH 7.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The calculated pKa for the transition between the two dimeric species is 7.07 ± 0.13 and 7.02 ± 0.11, as determined by polarized absorption spectra along the a and the b crystal axes, respectively (Fig. 4a, inset). In solution, the hemichrome and the high spin hexacoordinate component are the predominant species under all the conditions investigated (Fig. 4d and Fig. 5, b and c). The amount of hemichrome decreases in the alkaline range with a concomitant increase of the pentacoordinate heme, whereas the amount of hexacoordinate heme is essentially constant over the pH range studied. In 3 M phosphate, namely at an ionic strength approaching that of the crystal suspending medium, the amount of hemichrome is significantly higher than in 1 M phosphate (Fig. 5c). The polarization ratio for oxidized HbI crystals was calculated from the reference spectra at pH 8.5 (Fig. 2a) either at 602 nm or at 500 nm. At these wavelengths, which correspond to the absorbance maxima of the pentacoordinate and hexacoordinate high spin components, respectively, the heme behaves as a planar absorber(25.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 175-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The PR values obtained, 2.4 and 2.3, respectively, differ considerably from the value characteristic of the ferrous protein. Allosteric transitions of oligomeric proteins within the crystal lattice are usually limited by intermolecular interactions that stabilize a particular conformational state. This is the case for human hemoglobin A, Hb Rothschild, and des-Arg Hb, crystallized from polyethylene glycol solutions, that remain in the T state upon oxygenation(14.Brzozowski A. Derewenda Z.

However, when trigonal crystals of Escherichia coli aspartate carbamoyltransferase in the T state are soaked in a solution containing the substrate L-aspartate and phosphate, a slow molecular transition to the R state takes place, suggesting a kinetic rather than a thermodynamic barrier between the two conformations(27.Gouaux J.E. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in crystals of tetrameric L-lactate dehydrogenase from Bifidobacterium longum, grown from a solution where the R state conformation prevails, lattice forces favor a 1:1 mixture of T and R state molecules, the latter ones binding a substrate analog (28.Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Otha T. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Activity measurements have provided an independent criterion to establish whether and to which extent lattice interactions affect symmetry and regulation of some oligomeric proteins. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from lobster muscle retains in the crystalline state the negative cooperativity (“half-of-the-sites reactivity”) exhibited in solution in the reaction with the chromophoric acylating reagent β-(2-furyl)acryloylphosphate(29.Berni R.

The tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium maintains the reciprocal regulation of ligand binding and catalytic activity of the α and β sites mediated by intersubunit interactions(32.Ahmed S.A.

On the other hand, the asymmetric environment of the two chemically equivalent subunits of aspartate aminotransferase from chicken heart mithochondria within triclinic crystals causes a kinetic asymmetry in the reaction with natural substrates that has no counterpart in solution(34.Kirsten H. Gehring H. Christen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1807-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Suspensions of cross-linked microcrystals of rabbit muscle phosphorylase a showed homotropic cooperativity in the reaction involving a fixed concentration of glucose 1-phosphate and variable concentrations of maltoheptose (Hill coefficient in the crystal nH = 1.08 versus 1.17 in solution) but not in other reactions(35.Kasvinsky P.J. Madsen N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6852-6859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HbI represents a most favorable study case as it fully retains positive homotropic ligand binding cooperativity in crystals of the quality used for x-ray studies. The structure of liganded HbI presently available has been determined using crystals belonging to the monoclinic C2 space group (1.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21052-21061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the structure of deoxy-HbI has been determined using crystals belonging to the orthorhombic C2221 space group(2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. Science. 1990; 249: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3.Royer Jr., W.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 657-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The observed conformational differences between the liganded and the unliganded states of HbI involve small changes in the relative position of the two subunits (3.3° rotation and 0.4 Å translation) with striking changes in the heme environment. These include sinking of the heme groups 0.6 Å deeper into the subunits due to the extrusion of Phe-97 from the proximal side of the heme pocket into the subunit interface. The movement of one heme alters the hydrogen bond network that links the heme propionates to F helix residues (i.e. Lys-96 and Asn-100) of the other subunit, thus increasing its oxygen affinity. It will be of interest to compare these conformational differences with those occurring in orthorhombic crystals grown in the deoxy state and exposed to increasing oxygen pressure, in order to verify whether some of them may simply be due to different lattice contacts. The oxygen affinity measured along the two orthogonal axes is the same. Since the contribution of the two hemes to polarized light absorption is different along the two crystal axes (Table 1), this result indicates that, within experimental error, the two hemes possess the same oxygen affinity and, hence, that the monoliganded intermediates cannot be distinguished. The comparison of the polarization ratios of liganded and unliganded HbI provides information on a possible reorientation of the heme upon oxygenation. The similarity of the PR values (1.79-1.81) indicates that ligand binding is not accompanied by a heme tilt, in agreement with the existing crystallographic evidence(1.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21052-21061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25259-25267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed PR value for deoxy-HbI (1.79) is lower than that (2.0) calculated from the x-ray coordinates of the deoxy molecule, assuming a rigid heme plane. In all myoglobin and hemoglobin crystals, the observed PR value is consistently lower than the calculated value, due to fluctuations of the heme that produce an apparent out-of-plane (z-polarized) component in the heme absorption(36.Ansari A. Jones C.M. Henry E. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 852-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For oxidized HbI crystals, the PR value (2.3-2.4) observed at pH 8.5 differs from that characteristic of reduced HbI crystals and can be attributed to a different heme orientation. Although the available data do not allow one to estimate the extent of rotation, even a tilt of a few degrees would be expected to involve appreciable conformational changes in the surrounding globin, due to the tight packing of the heme inside the protein. Indeed, in the crystal, oxidation of reduced HbI induces the development of fine cracks, which rapidly disappear, while, in solution, the transition from reduced to oxidized HbI causes quaternary changes that ultimately lead to dissociation of the dimer into the monomeric, low spin hemichrome (M). The dissociation equilibrium in solution involves also two spectroscopically distinct dimeric species, a hexacoordinate aquomet (Dp) and a pentacoordinate (Dp) component, according to the scheme: M ß Dp ß Dp. As described by Spagnuolo et al.(21.Spagnuolo C. De Martino F. Boffi A. Rousseau D.L. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20441-20445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of Dp is essentially constant between pH 6.5 and 8.0 and over the ionic strength range 0.01-0.1 M. The monomeric hemichrome is favored by acid pH and higher ionic strength, while the pentacoordinate species prevails at alkaline pH and at low ionic strength. The monomerization process occurs in solution even under solvent conditions approaching those of the crystal mother liquor. In contrast, in the crystal the dimeric pentacoordinate form is stabilized over the whole pH range studied, whereas the monomeric hemichrome formation is absent due to lattice forces that drastically shift the equilibrium toward the right. Thus, HbI crystals provide an interesting example of the balance between lattice energies and energies involved in tertiary and quaternary rearrangements of multisubunit proteins. Lattice interactions that do not restrict the large tertiary and subtle quaternary conformational changes associated with cooperative oxygen binding are strong enough to impair the quaternary transition that would lead to dissociation of the oxidized protein into monomers."

Here, we present the novel finding that chronic reduction of dietary calories by 50% without changing the intake of dietary protein induced the activity of mouse hepatic carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (CpsI) 5-fold. In liver, CpsI protein, mRNA, and gene transcription were each stimulated by ∼3-fold. Thus, CR increased both the rate of gene transcription and the specific activity of the enzyme. Short-term feeding studies demonstrated that higher cpsI expression was due to CR and not consumption of more dietary protein. Intestinal CpsI activity was stimulated 2-fold, while its mRNA level did not change, suggesting enzyme activity or translation efficiency was stimulated. CpsI catalyzes the conversion of metabolic ammonia to carbamyl phosphate, the rate-limiting step in urea biosynthesis. cpsI induction suggests there is a shift in the metabolism of calorie-restricted animals toward protein catabolism. CpsI induction likely facilitates metabolic detoxification of ammonia, a strong neurotoxin. Enhanced protein turnover and metabolic detoxification may extend life span.

https://openalex.org/W2000519199,"Phosphorylation of G-protein-linked receptors is thought to play a central role in receptor regulation and desensitization. Unlike the case of the extensively studied β-adrenergic receptor/adenylate cyclase pathway, in which receptor-specific phosphorylation is known to be mediated by β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARK), the kinases responsible for phosphorylation of phospholipase C-linked receptors have yet to be identified, although a role for β-ARK has been implicated.

The subsequent hydrolysis of the lipid substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate releases the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) ( 1The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate β-ARK β-adrenergic receptor kinase CHO Chinese hamster ovary MRK muscarinic receptor kinase GRK G-protein linked receptor kinase H-89 (N-[2-((3-(4-bromophenyl)-2-propenyl)-amino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinoline PCR polymerase chain reaction PAGE polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) and diacylglycerol (reviewed in (1.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6147) Google Scholar)). The second messenger response to a number of phospholipase C-linked receptors, including the m3-muscarinic receptor, is often complex, consisting of a burst of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production reaching a peak within the first few seconds of receptor stimulation followed by a lower sustained phase of Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation that is maintained for tens of minutes to hours(2.Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3.Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol.

Similar patterns of Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation are seen in response to agonist occupation of receptors for GRH(5.Morgan R.O. Chang J.P. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), angiotensin(6.Balla T. Baukal A.J. Guillemette G. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar).Little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying these complex second messenger responses, although recent evidence suggests that some phospholipase C-linked receptors undergo a rapid partial desensitization that results in decreased phospholipase C activity within seconds of agonist occupation(3.Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Fisher S.K. Slowiejko D.M. McEwen E.L. Neurochem.

Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion are studies from our laboratory demonstrating that the early peak phase of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to m3-muscarinic receptor stimulation can be desensitized by a short pre-exposure to agonist, whereas the sustained phase of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production is resistant to desensitization (3.Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar).One possible mechanism regulating the receptor/phospholipase C pathway is receptor phosphorylation. The involvement of β-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation in the desensitization of the β-adrenergic/adenylate cyclase system has been well documented (reviewed in (10.Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar)). In this case the agonist-occupied form of the β-adrenergic receptor is phosphorylated by two kinases, protein kinase A and a receptor-specific kinase termed β-adrenergic receptor kinase (β-ARK). The process of receptor phosphorylation results in uncoupling of the β-adrenergic receptor from the Gs-protein(10.Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It is now clear that in addition to β-adrenergic receptors other G-protein linked receptors also exist as phosphoproteins. In particular, phospholipase C/Gq/11-coupled CCK(11.Klueppelberg U.G. Gates L.K. Gorelick F.S. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8944-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have all been shown to exist as phosphoproteins in intact cells, and the level of phosphorylation is enhanced following agonist stimulation. The receptor-specific kinase(s) responsible for these phosphorylation events have yet to be fully characterized, although some authors have suggested that β-ARK may act as a general G-protein-linked receptor kinase with a broad substrate specificity(18.Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krausse J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 91961-99164Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Certainly, β-ARK has been implicated in the phosphorylation of CCK receptors in pancreatic acinar cells (19.Gates L.K. Ulrich C.D. Miller L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G840-G847PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant thrombin receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and fibroblasts(15.Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, substance P and m3-muscarinic receptors have been shown to act as in vitro substrates for β-ARK(18.Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krausse J.E.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233PubMed Google Scholar).The two isotypes of β-ARK (β-ARK-1 and −2) are members of a family of protein kinases that includes rhodopsin kinase, IT-11, GRK-5, and GRK-6, which are related on the basis of primary amino acid sequence homology and are collectively termed the G-protein-linked receptor kinase family (GRK) (reviewed in (21.Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar)). The existence of the GRK family suggests that G-protein-linked receptor phosphorylation may be mediated by more than one receptor-specific kinase. However, the cellular substrates for IT-11, GRK-5, and GRK-6 are unknown despite in vitro evidence that these kinases are able to phosphorylate a number of G-protein-linked receptors(22.Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23.Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The possibility that a receptor kinase(s) other than β-ARK may be involved in the phosphorylation of G-protein-linked receptors has been suggested by recent studies from our laboratory on the phospholipase C-linked m3-muscarinic receptor(12.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that recombinant human m3-muscarinic receptors expressed in CHO cells (CHO-m3 cells) undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation on serine. The time course for receptor phosphorylation is very rapid, occurring within seconds of agonist addition, and correlates with the rapid but partial desensitization of the phosphoinositide response seen within the first 20 s of receptor stimulation(8.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9.Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J.

Initial characterization demonstrated the kinase to be distinct from the known second messenger-regulated protein kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase C(12.Tobin A.B.

Further characterization in a broken cell preparation revealed that a membrane-associated kinase was able to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor and that this kinase was not affected by heparin or zinc at concentrations that inhibit β-ARK(24.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Letts. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings indicated that m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation was mediated by a novel receptor kinase.Described here is the purification from porcine cerebellum of a novel 40-kDa protein kinase that is able to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner. The purification was based on the ability of the muscarinic receptor kinase to phosphorylate a bacterial fusion protein encoding a region of the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (Ex-m3).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of the Bacterial Fusion Protein Ex-m3Preparation of the bacterial expression vector pEx-m3 has previously been described(12.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a region of the human m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA encoding the third intracellular loop between Ser345 and Leu463, inclusive, was subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). This produced the plasmid pEx-m3 where the region encoding amino acids Ser345-Leu463 of the m3-muscarinic receptor was downstream of, and in frame with, the coding sequence for glutathione S-transferase contained in pGEX-2T. Induction of pEx-m3-transformed Escherichia coli (DH5α) with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM) resulted in the production of a fusion protein of ∽43.5 kDa (glutathione S-transferase = 27.5 kDa, Ser345-Leu463 16 kDa). The fusion protein was purified over a glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrix (Pharmacia) before being used in the assay described below.Construction of Truncated Bacterial Fusion ProteinsIn order to characterize the substrate specificity of muscarinic receptor kinase preparations a series of truncated forms of Ex-m3 were synthesized. For a summary of the fusion proteins see Fig. 8A.pEx345-427 was constructed using the following PCR primers: 5′ primer, CCCGGATCCCTGGAGAACTCCGCC; 3′ primer, CCGGAATTCAAGCTTGGAGAAGCTTTT. These primers were used to amplify a region of the human m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA that encodes amino acids Ser345-Leu427. The primers were designed to allow in-frame cloning into pGEX-2T via a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end.pEx376-463 was synthesized using the same strategy, but in this case the 5′ PCR primer was CCCGGATCCACCATCCTCAACTCCACC, and the 3′ primer was CCCGAATTCCAGAGTGGCTTCCTTGAAG. This amplified a region of human m3-muscarinic cDNA that encoded amino acids Thr376-Leu463, which was then cloned into pGEX-2T.pΔHind was constructed by digestion of pEx-m3 with the restriction enzyme HindIII. This removed a section of cDNA from the muscarinic region of pEx-m3 that encoded for amino acids Leu371-Lys426, inclusive.pΔH-V was constructed by ligating two PCR reaction products into pGEX-2T in a three-way ligation where pGEX-2T was digested with BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′), PCR reaction product 1 was digested with BamHI (5′) and ApaI (3′), and PCR reaction product 2 was digested with ApaI (5′) and EcoRI (3′). PCR primers used were (for product 1) 5′ primer CCCGGATCCCTGGAGAACTCCGCC and 3′ primer GCTGGGCCCCGGAAGCTTGAGCAC and (for product 2) 5′ primer CAGGGGCCCGAGGAGGAGCTGGGG and 3′ primer CCCGAATTCCAGAGTGGCTTCCTTGAAG. The resulting construct encoded a truncated form of Ex-m3 where amino acids His374-Val391, inclusive, were deleted.The above constructs were used to transform E. coli (DH5α). Induction and purification of fusion proteins was the same as that described for Ex-m3.Assay for Muscarinic Receptor Kinase ActivitySamples from chromatography fractions (10 μl) or from cell or tissue preparations were incubated with purified Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) containing 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (0.4-1.0 cpm/fmol) for 10 min at 37°C (final volume, 110 μl). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). Glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl, Pharmacia) was added and collected by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 s), washed twice with 1 ml of TE buffer. Bound fusion protein was dissociated by boiling in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20 μl). Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. In order to ensure the equal recovery of fusion proteins and to confirm the relative positions of fusion proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. This was particularly important in experiments using truncated fusion proteins, where the extent of phosphorylation was compared as a method of determining substrate specificity of the kinase preparations. Gels were then dried and autoradiographs obtained, and/or bands corresponding to the fusion protein were excised and counted.Cell CultureCHO cell cultures stably transfected with human m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA (CHO-m3 cells, a kind gift from Dr. N. J. Buckley, Department of Pharmacology, University College, London) contained ∽2100 fmol of receptor/mg of protein. These cells were routinely maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), fungizone (2.5 μg/ml), and fetal calf serum (10% v/v).Preparation of Crude Cytosolic or Membrane Fractions from CHO-m3 CellsInitial muscarinic receptor kinase preparations were obtained from cytosolic and membrane fractions of CHO-m3 cells. The cytosolic preparation was obtained by harvesting 10 (175-cm2) flasks of CHO-m3 cells, which were resuspended in 2 ml of kinase buffer plus protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml benzamine, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide). The cells were allowed to swell for 10-15 min and were then homogenized by a 10-s pulse in a tissue homogenizer (Polytron). A high speed supernatant fraction was then obtained by centrifugation for 30 min at 300,000 × g, and proteins were adjusted to 1-5 mg/ml.Membranes were prepared from CHO-m3 cells by homogenization of the cells as above but this time in 15 ml of TE buffer plus protease inhibitors. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in kinase buffer at 1 mg protein/ml.10 μl of either the membrane or cytosolic preparations were used in the assay for kinase activity.Purification of Muscarinic Receptor Kinase from Porcine CerebellumCerebella from 15 young pigs (∽180 g of tissue) were homogenized in 1 liter of TE buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 100 μg/ml benzamine, 100 μg/ml iodoacetamide). All subsequent buffers contained this complement of protease inhibitors, and the preparation was carried out at 4°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 45 min, and a high speed supernatant fraction (S200 fraction) was obtained by further centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min. The protein pellet from a 30-60% ammonium sulfate cut of the S200 fraction was resuspended in TE buffer (120 ml) and dialyzed against TE buffer containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4. This preparation was loaded onto a 70-ml butyl-Sepharose fast flow column (16 × 320 mm) equilibrated with TE buffer containing 1 M (NH4)2SO4. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1-0 M (NH4)2SO4 over 10 bed volumes (flow rate = 1 ml/min). Fractions (12 ml) were collected, and the peak activity, which eluted at ∽0.54 M (NH4)2SO4, was pooled and dialyzed against TE buffer.The sample was then passed through a 6-ml Resource Q (Pharmacia) column. This resolved muscarinic receptor kinase activity from casein kinase II that during the course of this study was found to also phosphorylate the Ex-m3 fusion protein (see “Results” and “Discussion”). The flow-through from the Resource Q column was applied to a 1-ml Resource S (Pharmacia) column. The Resource S column was then eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl over 20 bed volumes (flow rate = 1 ml/min). 1-ml fractions were collected. The kinase activity eluted as a single peak at ∽0.32 M NaCl. These fractions were combined and passed through a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.32 M NaCl. The column was eluted using a linear gradient of 0.32-2.0 M NaCl. The kinase activity eluted as a single peak at ∽0.87 M NaCl.Partial Purification of Muscarinic Receptor Kinase Activity from Particulate and Soluble Fractions of CHO-m3 CellsTen confluent (175-cm2) flasks of CHO-m3 cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of TE buffer containing protease inhibitors (as above). Cells were allowed to swell for 10-15 min and then were homogenized using a 10-s pulse in a Polytron. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (3 min at 500 × g). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were then prepared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was passed through a 1-ml Resource S column equilibrated with TE buffer, and the column was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 M NaCl. 1-ml fractions were collected. Kinase activity eluted from the Resource S column at the same position as that observed in the brain preparation, i.e. ∽0.32 M NaCl.Membranes from the above preparation were either used directly to test for muscarinic receptor kinase activity or extracted with 15 ml of 1.5 M KCl/TE buffer for 3 h at 4°C. The extract was dialyzed against TE buffer and run through a 1-ml Resource S column. The column was eluted as described above. The peak kinase activity eluted at ∽0.32 M NaCl.Phosphorylation of m3-Muscarinic Receptors in Membrane Preparations from CHO-m3 CellsCrude CHO-m3 cell membranes were prepared as described above and resuspended in kinase buffer at 1 mg of protein/ml. 50 μl of membranes (∽0.1 pmol of receptor) were used in a phosphorylation reaction mixture that contained final concentrations of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2,1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM [γ-32P] ATP (1-4 cpm/fmol of ATP) ± 1 mM carbachol and ± 10 μM atropine. Total volume was 100 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of ATP and continued at 32°C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 s. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and membranes were solubilized with 1 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate) for 30 min on ice. m3-Muscarinic receptors were then immunoprecipitated with a specific antiserum (number 332) as described previously(12.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In experiments to test the ability of the fusion protein Ex-m3 to inhibit the m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation, Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) or a molar equivalent of glutathione S-transferase was added to the reaction mixture. At the end of the reaction Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) was added to control tubes, thereby ensuring that all tubes contained equal amounts of Ex-m3, since the fusion protein will compete with the receptor for the antibody in the immunoprecipitation. The reaction was then stopped in the way described above, and m3-muscarinic receptors were then solubilized and immunoprecipitated.In experiments where purified muscarinic receptor kinase was tested for its ability to phosphorylate the intact m3-muscarinic receptor, an aliquot of the kinase preparation (10 μl, ∽2.5 pmol) was added to the reaction mixture. To control tubes a buffer blank was added (this gave a final NaCl concentration of 87 mM). The reaction was then started and terminated as described above.Muscarinic Receptor Kinase AutophosphorylationAn aliquot of purified muscarinic receptor kinase (20 μl) was added to a reaction mix containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 130 mM NaCl, 100 μM [γ-32P] ATP (1-4 cpm/fmol of ATP) (total volume, 135 μl). After 30 min at 37°C the reaction was terminated by the addition of 15 μl of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated protein pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel.Miscellaneous ProceduresSilver stain was performed using a Bio-Rad silver stain kit. Determination of the relative intensities of phosphorylated bands was carried out using a Bio-Rad model GS 670 densitometer.RESULTSAssay for Muscarinic Receptor Kinase ActivityPrevious studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the m3-muscarinic receptor expressed in CHO cells (CHO-m3 cells) was phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by a kinase distinct from the G-protein-linked receptor kinases characterized to date(12.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Letts. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hence, in order to isolate the novel m3-muscarinic receptor kinase an assay for kinase activity was developed.The bacterial fusion protein Ex-m3, containing a region of the third intracellular loop of the human m3-muscarinic receptor (Ser345-Leu463) acted as a substrate for a kinase in cytosolic extracts from CHO-m3 cells (Fig. 1). There was no phosphorylation of the bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (Fig. 1). Furthermore, following digestion of phosphorylated Ex-m3 fusion protein with thrombin, a process that releases the m3-muscarinic receptor region, the 32P label was associated only with the m3-muscarinic region and not the glutathione S-transferase portion of the fusion protein (data not shown). A similar kinase activity was also identified in membrane preparations from CHO-m3 cells, but the kinase activity was ∽30-fold lower than that observed in cytosolic extracts. Studies described below indicate that the kinase associated with the membrane fraction is likely to be the same as the cytosolic kinase.Figure 1:Phosphorylation of Ex-m3 by a cytosolic extract from CHO-m3 cells. A high speed supernatant extract from CHO-m3 cells (10-50 μg of protein) was tested for kinase activity capable of phosphorylating the recombinant bacterial proteins, Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) and glutathione S-transferase (2.0 μg, GST). Shown is a Coomassie Blue stain of the purified bacterial proteins indicating their relative positions on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and an autoradiograph showing the phosphorylated products. Indicated are the positions of prestained molecular weight standards. The results are representative of at least five experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously demonstrated agonist-driven m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in membranes from CHO-m3 cells, suggesting that the muscarinic receptor kinase is, at least in part, associated with the plasma membrane(24.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Letts. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that the Ex-m3 fusion protein was acting as a pseudosubstrate for the m3-muscarinic receptor kinase, experiments were conducted to investigate the ability of Ex-m3 to block agonist sensitive muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in membranes from CHO-m3 cells. Fig. 2 shows that Ex-m3 was able to inhibit agonist-induced m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in CHO-m3 membranes, whereas glutathione S-transferase had no effect. Note also, that in addition to blocking m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation, the Ex-m3 fusion protein was itself phosphorylated (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Inhibition of agonist-driven phosphorylation of m3-muscarinic receptors in membranes from CHO-m3 cells. Membranes from CHO-m3 cells (50 μg of protein, ∽0.1 pmol of m3-receptor) were challenged with or without 1 mM carbachol in the presence of 100 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1-4 cpm/fmol of ATP) for 10 min at 32°C. The receptors were then solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. The effect of Ex-m3 (3.5 μg) or a molar equivalent of glutathione S-transferase (2.0 μg, GST) on agonist-driven m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation was determined. Note: in the lane where Ex-m3 was added, the fusion protein as well as the receptor was immunoprecipitated. Indicated are the positions of prestained molecular weight standards. The results are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purification of the Muscarinic Receptor Kinase (MRK) from Porcine CerebellumDuring the course of developing the purification strategy it was found that casein kinase II, which has a ubiquitous distribution, was able to phosphorylate the Ex-m3 fusion protein (see “Discussion”).

These sequences induce retrieval from compartments located downstream in the secretory pathway. It has been suggested that the retrieval may occur from multiple sites, ranging from the intermediate compartment to the trans-Golgi network. To compare the retrieval of luminal and type I membrane proteins, we have used different forms of a single reporter, the human CD8 glycoprotein, stably expressed in FRT cells. Metabolic labeling and oligosaccharide analysis show that the mechanism based on the KDEL signal is leaky. With time, the KDEL-containing CD8 form reaches the trans/trans-Golgi network compartments, where the protein is terminally glycosylated. At this stage, the retrieval mechanism stops being effective and the protein is consequently secreted. Conversely, the mechanism based on the KKXX signal guarantees that most of the KKXX-containing CD8 form resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, little in the Golgi complex and undetectable levels at the plasma membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1984351403,"We have previously shown that the sequential arrangement of histone-DNA contacts is essentially the same in the nucleosomal core of sea urchin sperm nuclei, where chromatin is highly condensed and repressed, and in nuclei from lily bud sepals or yeast, where chromatin is highly active in transcription and replication and is significantly or completely depleted of histone H1. However, the difference in the strength of some histone-DNA contacts has not been understood or discussed. In this work, we demonstrate that some of these differences are due to a conformational change in the nucleosomal core. We show that the nucleosomal core in linker histone-depleted chromatin is in a different conformational state compared with the nucleosomal core in folded chromatin or in isolated core nucleosomes. This conformational state is characterized by altered strengths in the histone H4 and H2A/H2B contacts with the regions of sharply bent nucleosomal DNA around sites +/-1 and +/-4 and site +/-5, respectively. We demonstrate that this conformation, which we call the stretched nucleosome, is a general feature of unfolded linker histone-depleted chromatin and may occur during chromatin activation. Our results suggest that this nucleosome structural alteration does not depend on chromatin sources and histone variants studied in this work. In addition, we show that this alteration is reversible and is caused by the stretching of linker DNA during chromatin unfolding."
https://openalex.org/W1987873126,"Four human IgE isoforms produced by alternative splicing of the epsilon primary transcript were expressed as chimeric mouse/human anti 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl antibodies in the murine myeloma cell line Sp2/0. The four isoforms include the classic secreted form and three novel isoforms with altered carboxyl termini. All of these isoforms lack the transmembrane region encoded by the M1/M1′ exon and are therefore predicted to be secreted proteins. When expressed in Sp2/0 cells, three of the IgE isoforms are assembled into complete molecules of two Ig heavy chains and two Ig light chains, whereas the fourth isoform is predominately assembled into half-molecules of one Ig heavy chain and one Ig light chain. All four isoforms are secreted with similar kinetics. In contrast, when the isoform containing the Cε4 domain joined directly to the M2′ exon (IgE grandé) is expressed in the J558L cell line, it is degraded intracellularly, suggesting a cell line-dependent regulation of secretion. These data show that these novel isoforms of human IgE, predicted to occur from in vivo and in vitro mRNA analysis, can be produced and secreted by mammalian cells. The different forms of IgE may have physiologically relevant but distinct roles in human IgE-mediated immune inflammation.

Alternative RNA splicing determines the production of secreted versus membrane-bound forms of immunoglobulins(1.Rogers J. Early P. Carter C. Calame K. Bond M. Hood L. Wall R.

This is accomplished in mammals by the alternative usage of either a secreted terminus at the end of the last constant region domain or two downstream exons (M1 and M2) that encode the transmembrane and intracellular amino acids. Splicing to the M exons removes from the transcript the nucleotides that encode the hydrophilic COOH terminus and polyadenylation signal for the smaller, secreted form of the Ig. The one functional genomic locus encoding human epsilon heavy chain contains four Ig domain exons (Cε1 to Cε4) and the two membrane exons (M1 and M2). We (3.Diaz-Sanchez D. Zhang K. Nutman T.B.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 129-136PubMed Google Scholar) have previously shown that RNA prepared from the IgE-producing human cell line AF-10 and from fresh B lymphocytes stimulated to make IgE contain a variety of epsilon mRNAs produced by alternative splicing. In contrast to what is observed with other isotypes, the most common form of mRNA encoding membrane IgE is produced by splicing to a novel splice acceptor 156 base pairs upstream of the normal M1 acceptor site(4.Zhang K. Saxon A. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7.Peng C. Davis F.M. Sun L.K. Liou R.S. Kim Y.-W. Chang T.W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 129-136PubMed Google Scholar). The M1′ exon produced using this splice acceptor encodes 52 novel amino acids that are largely hydrophilic followed by the amino acids normally encoded by M1. Other alternatively spliced epsilon mRNAs are present that encode a series of potentially secreted proteins. The splicing events that generate these mRNAs utilize several novel exons including M2′, M2″, and Cε5 in addition to the classic secreted form (see Fig. 1A). The M2′ exon is created by splicing directly from Cε4 to the normal M2 splice acceptor. The omission of M1 results in a frameshift in M2, which creates an open reading frame encoding 136 hydrophilic amino acids (i.e. M2′). M2″ is a short tail (8 amino acids) created by splicing from Cε4 to a splice acceptor located within the M2′ exon. The reading frame of M2″ is different from that of M2′(4.Zhang K. Saxon A. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang K. Max E.E. Cheah H.-K. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 456-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of great interest whether these novel mRNAs encode functional proteins and whether these various forms of IgE play distinct roles in the immune response. Using polyclonal anti-peptide antibodies, we have detected the protein product of one of these novel splice variants in the supernatant and cytoplasm of AF-10 cells and in serum from a patient with IgE myeloma(3.Diaz-Sanchez D. Zhang K. Nutman T.B. Saxon A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1930-1941PubMed Google Scholar). However, the low level of IgE present in normal serum makes it impossible to isolate sufficient quantities with adequate purity for definitive functional studies. Human IgE is the least abundant Ig with average serum concentrations (125 ng/ml) generally 100,000-fold less than IgG in normal individuals. Purification from serum would be further confounded by the similar molecular size of several of the splice variants. Therefore, we have focused on developing expression systems for the production of each epsilon splice variant. In a recent study, Batista et al.(8.Batista F.D. Efremov D.G. Burrone O.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar) report the expression in J558L murine myeloma cells of five constructs that encode individual splice variants of IgE(8.Batista F.D. Efremov D.G. Burrone O.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). The conclusions of this study were that only one form of IgE is detectable on the surface of the transfected cells and only one form of soluble IgE is secreted by myeloma cells. These forms were found to correspond to the CH4-M1′ membrane-bound and the classic secreted (CH4-S) forms of IgE, respectively. Although Western blotting of protein secreted by the cell line U266 revealed heterogeneity of epsilon chains, Batista et al.(8.Batista F.D. Efremov D.G. Burrone O.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar) conclude that this is the result of differential glycosylation. They further conclude that the novel epsilon isoforms produced by alternatively spliced mRNAs are degraded intracellularly and therefore cannot constitute functionally relevant forms of IgE. In the present study, we demonstrate the expression and secretion of four soluble isoforms of human IgE by the murine myeloma cell line Sp2/0. The isoforms examined are classic secreted (CH4-S), CH4-M2′, CH4-M2″, and CH4′-CH5. We designate these proteins as IgE classic, IgE grandé, IgE tailpiece (IgEtp), and IgE chimeric CH4 (IgEψCH4), respectively. All four isoforms show similar kinetics and efficiency of assembly and secretion, although one of the isoforms (i.e. IgEψCH4) is secreted predominately as HL ( 1The abbreviations used are: H immunoglobulin heavy chain L immunoglobulin light chain dansyl 5-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonyl PCR polymerase chain reaction RT reverse transcription UTR untranslated region ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.) half-molecules. Furthermore, the production of secreted protein is shown to depend on the murine myeloma cell line used for expression. To create isoform-specific epsilon constructs, a portion of the human epsilon gene encoding Cε1 through Cε4 was fused in-frame to three RT-PCR clones. The RT-PCR clones span the downstream sequences resulting from alternative splicing events as well as a portion of Cε4 (see Fig. 1B). RT-PCR cloning of 3′ portions of the various epsilon mRNAs has been reported(4.Zhang K. Saxon A. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang K. Max E.E. Cheah H.-K. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 456-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from both the IgE-producing human myeloma AF-10 and from purified B cells stimulated to produce IgE with interleukin-4 and CD-40 monoclonal antibody. The RNA was then reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)15 primer (Boehringer Mannheim) and mouse Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was then used as substrate for PCR reactions using upstream primers located within Cε4 at Asp497-Gln504 (IgEψCH4) or at Glu541-Val549 (IgE grandé and IgEtp) (5.Zhang K. Max E.E. Cheah H.-K. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 456-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a downstream primer located 21-42 nucleotides 3′ of the M2′ exon (4.Zhang K. Saxon A. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PCR reaction mixtures contained 10% Me2SO, 50 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml nuclease-free bovine serum albumin. Primer concentration was 0.5 μM. Reactions were carried out for 40 cycles at the following temperatures: melting for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 1 min at 72°C, and extension for 1 min at 72°C. Isoform-specific epsilon chain genes were created by first using PCR mutagenesis to create novel XbaI or NheI restriction sites within the Cε4 coding region of each of these RT-PCR clones and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of each clone (before the polyadenylation addition signal). PCR mutagenesis was then used to create the identical mutations within the Cε4 exon of the human genomic epsilon gene. The XbaI site was created at arginine 520; the NheI site was added at alanine 543. In all cases introduction of the restriction sites did not alter the amino acid sequence. The XbaI or NheI sites were then used to fuse the various downstream sequences with the epsilon gene. The 3′-untranslated region (UTR) from human γ3 heavy chain gene had been provided with an EcoRI site 5′ of the polyadenylation addition signal (9.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5322-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and was substituted for the 3′-UTR of the human epsilon gene by ligation at the EcoRI sites created at the 3′ ends of the RT-PCR clones. The genes encoding the different epsilon isoforms were then cloned into pSV2 gpt containing the coding sequence for a heavy chain variable domain specific for the hapten dansyl chloride under control of the Ig heavy chain promoter and Ig heavy chain enhancer(9.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5322-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This was done by ligation at the BamHI site at the 3′ end of the 3′-UTR (see Fig. 1C) and by ligation of the XhoI site immediately 5′ of the Cε1 exon with a SalI site 3′ of the Ig heavy chain enhancer in the expression vector. The SalI and XhoI sites were destroyed in the ligation and are indicated by Δ in Fig. 1C. The anti-dansyl light chain used is a chimeric kappa chain consisting of a murine variable (VL) domain and human Cκ domain.(10.Oi V.T. Morrison S.L. BioTechniques. 1986; 4: 214-221Google Scholar). Sp2/0 and J558L murine myeloma cells and various transfectants thereof were carried in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 5% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). A stable anti-dansyl light chain-producing line (TWS) was established from Sp2/0 cells as described previously (9.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5322-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Stable IgE-producing cell lines were created by electroporation of the isoform-specific heavy chain in the pSV2 gpt expression vector into TWS(9.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5322-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of DNA linearized at the BamHI site was added to 107 TWS cells in 0.9 ml phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were pulsed at 200 V with 960 microfarads in a 0.4-cm electrode gap cuvette (Bio-Rad). Stable transfectants were selected for growth in medium containing 42 μg/ml hypoxanthine, 1 μg/ml xanthine, and 2.5 μg/ml mycophenolic acid. Clones producing IgE were identified by ELISA using plates coated with dansyl chloride-bovine serum albumin. Supernatants from clones were added to wells, and bound protein was detected using goat anti-human kappa chain conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Nonsecreting transfectants of J558L were identified by lysis of ~5 × 105 cells in lysis buffer (lysis buffer = 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA) and analysis of lysates by ELISA using plates coated with the anti-human IgE monoclonal antibody CIA 7.12 (see ELISA section below). Bound protein was detected using goat anti-human epsilon chain conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody CIA-7.12 that recognizes an epitope at the Cε2/Cε3 boundary was used as the coating reagent as described(11.Macy E. Kemeny M. Saxon A. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 3003-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After blocking, the cell culture supernatants containing expressed IgE isoforms were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. CIA-7.12 or a 1:500 dilution of α-2331, a rabbit antiserum generated against a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 10 amino acids of IgE grandé(3.Diaz-Sanchez D. Zhang K. Nutman T.B. Saxon A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1930-1941PubMed Google Scholar) was then added to the microplate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by a 2-h incubation with goat anti IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Western blotting analysis had been previously described(3.Diaz-Sanchez D. Zhang K. Nutman T.B. Saxon A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1930-1941PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Zhang K. Saxon A. Max E.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5.Zhang K. Max E.E. Cheah H.-K. Saxon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 456-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the expressed IgE isoforms were immunoprecipitated from the cell culture supernatants with monoclonal antibody CIA-7.12 coupled to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After transfer, the nylon membrane was blocked by 4% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline/Tween for 4 h at room temperature. For ε protein detection, the blot was probed with goat anti-human IgE (ε chain-specific) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Kirkagaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). For detection of IgE grandé, the blot was incubated with 1:200 diluted α-2331 overnight at 4°C followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma). Color development was performed with an alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. 4-10 × 106 transfected cells were washed twice in 2 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), resuspended in 1 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing [35S]methionine (15 μCi/106 cells) (ICN, Irvine, CA), and incubated at 37°C for 6-18 h. Supernatant from the cell culture was cleared of debris by centrifugation for 5 min at 225 × g at 4°C. To precipitate the Ig protein, 2.5 μl of rabbit anti-human Fab antiserum (R27) was added to each culture supernatant, and the supernatant was incubated at 4°C for 2-18 h. 100 μl of IgGsorb Staph A (The Enzyme Center, Inc., Malden, MA) was then added, and the supernatant was incubated at 4°C for 15 min to 1 h. Immune complexes were spun through a pad of 30% sucrose + 0.15% SDS + 0.5X NDET (1 × NDET = 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 66 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4), and the pellet was washed sequentially in 300 μl of NDET + 0.3% SDS and 400 μl of distilled H2O. The pellet was then resuspended in sample loading buffer (loading buffer = 25 mM Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and ~0.1 μg/ml bromphenol blue) and boiled for 2 min. The samples were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels(12.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gel analysis, samples were first electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels(12.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the lane containing the sample of interest was excised and incubated in sample loading buffer containing 5% dithiothreitol (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at room temperature. The lane was then embedded in 12.5% polyacrylamide. Electrophoresis in the second dimension was then done as described (12.Shin S.-U. Morrison S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 178: 459-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 2-8 × 106 transfected cells/time point were washed twice in 2 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Washed cells were then incubated in 2 ml of methionine-deficient Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h at 37°C to deplete the cells of intracellular methionine. Cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine (ICN) (15 μCi/106 cells) for 5 min at 37°C and then chased with 8 ml of chase medium that had been prewarmed to 37°C (chase medium = Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Irvine Scientific) + 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) + 3.36 mg/ml unlabeled methionine (Schwartz/Mann, Orangeburg, NY)). At various time points, 1-ml aliquots were removed to tubes containing an equal volume of prechilled phosphate-buffered saline on ice. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined at various time points to confirm that the amount of nonradioactive methionine added was sufficient to prevent continued [35S]methionine incorporation during the 3-h chase. Cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation for 5 min at 225 × g at 4°C. Cell lysates were prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of NDET, centrifuging at 4°C for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and discarding the pellet. IgE was precipitated from supernatants and cell lysates with a mixture of rabbit anti-human Fab (R27 antiserum) and rabbit anti-human epsilon (ICN) as described above. For densitometry of IgE assembly intermediates, nonreducing gels from pulse-chase experiments were visualized by autoradiography and scanned on a Hewlett/Packard ScanJet IIcx scanner. The images were analyzed at 600 dots/inch using the NIH Image software package. Fig. 1B illustrates the strategy used for generating constructs encoding specific isoforms of human IgE. RT-PCR products encompassing the 3′ portion of Cε4 and sequences downstream were mutagenized by PCR to introduce either an XbaI site or an NheI site within the Cε4 portion of the RT-PCR clone without altering the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. The identical restriction sites were also engineered in a separate construct containing the Cε1 through Cε4 exons. Mutagenesis was also used to introduce an EcoRI site after the termination codons of the RT-PCR clones. The RT-PCR clones containing 3′ coding sequences were fused to the sequences for Cε1 through Cε4 at the XbaI or NheI site. A polyadenylation addition signal was provided by ligation to an EcoRI site previously engineered immediately upstream of the polyadenylation signal in the 3′-untranslated region from human IgG3 (γ3 3′-UT in Fig. 1). The resulting constructs were subcloned into pSV2 gpt containing an exon encoding a variable heavy domain specific for the hapten dansyl chloride (see Fig. 1C). The expression vectors were then transfected into an Sp2/0-derived cell line previously transfected with a chimeric light chain comprised of a murine anti-dansyl VL domain and a human Cκ domain or were transfected into the J558L cell line, which synthesizes a murine λ light chain. Analysis of the proteins secreted by the IgE transfectomas is shown in Fig. 2. Transfectomas expressing IgE classic, IgE grandé, and IgEtp produce a protein of approximately 190 kDa (Fig. 2A) that reduces upon treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol to a heavy chain of approximately 75 kDa and a light chain of approximately 25 kDa (Fig. 2B). This indicates that these isoforms are secreted as fully assembled H2L2 molecules. As expected, IgE classic and IgEtp migrate with identical mobilities, whereas IgE grandé migrates slightly slower. The transfectoma expressing IgEψCH4 secretes HL, which migrates as a broad band that is 75-90 kDa as well as light chain of approximately 25 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A). A minor component migrating at approximately 150 kDa that is apparently H2L is detectable in only some experiments (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3H and data not shown). The heavy chain of IgEψCH4 migrates somewhat faster than the heavy chain of the other three isoforms (Fig. 2B). This difference is not due to glycosylation because it is still evident when the transfectomas are labeled in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (data not shown). However, the diffuse migration of the 75-90-kDa species does indicate heterogeneous glycosylation of the epsilon heavy chain because it is no longer evident when the transfectoma is labeled in the presence of tunicamycin. A panel of ten transfectomas expressing IgEψCH4 (data not shown) all showed this pattern of assembly. The identities of the 75-90- and 150-kDa species as HL and H2L, respectively, are supported by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). The species that migrate as 75-90 and 150 kDa in the first dimension (nonreducing conditions) dissociate into heavy and light chains when run reduced in the second dimension. Furthermore, the 75-90-kDa species both immunoprecipitates and reacts in Western blots with epsilon-specific monoclonal and polyclonal reagents (data not shown). In addition to fully assembled H2L2 molecules, all four cell lines secrete free light chain (L) and light chain dimers (L2), as is frequently observed in this expression system (Fig. 2A). Secretion of light chain dimer is not evident for the IgEψCH4-producing transfectoma in Fig. 2A but can be seen occasionally (e.g.Fig. 3H).Figure 3:Intracellular assembly and secretion of IgE isoforms. 2-8 × 106 cells/time point were incubated in methionine-deficient medium for 1 h to deplete intracellular methionine. Cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine (15 μCi/106 cells) for 5 min at 37°C and then chased with a ~100-fold excess of unlabeled methionine. Samples were taken at various time points following addition of the chase. Epsilon and kappa chains were then immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasms and secretions at each time point and run on 5% gels under nonreducing conditions. A, IgE classic cytoplasms. B, IgE classic secretions. C, IgE grandé cytoplasms. D, IgE grandé secretions. E, IgEtp cytoplasms. F, IgEtp secretions. G, IgEψCH4 cytoplasms. H, IgEψCH4 secretions. The open and closed arrows in C denote non-IgE proteins co-precipitating with IgE grandé; the asterisk in F denotes a secreted species that we propose but have not proven to be the H2 form of IgEtp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the protein secreted by the cell line producing IgE grandé does not migrate as slowly as one would predict based on amino acid translation, we undertook experiments to verify that the protein was indeed complete and intact. Initially, the expression construct for IgE grandé was subjected to extensive restriction analysis, which showed that the entire coding region had been retained in the construct (data not shown). Due to concern that the novel 136-amino acid tail of the IgE grandé could be post-translationally cleaved, the protein was analyzed by ELISA and Western blotting using antibodies specific for the Cε2/Cε3 boundary (CIA-7.12) and for the COOH-terminal ten amino acids of IgE grandé (α-2331). As expected, both IgE classic and IgE grandé were recognized by CIA-7.12, whereas α-2331 recognized IgE grandé but failed to recognize classic secreted IgE (Table 1 and data not shown). Neither CIA-7.12 nor α-2331 recognized an IgG control. Recognition of IgE grandé by α-2331 indicates that the large secreted terminus of IgE grandé is not removed by proteolytic processing. In addition, recognition of IgE grandé by monoclonal antibody CIA-7.12 indicates that the Cε2-Cε3 interface (the epitope that CIA-7.12 recognizes) is intact; the ability of IgE grandé to bind antigen confirms that VH is present.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To dissect the assembly pathways of the various forms of IgE and to determine the efficiency of secretion, we conducted pulse-chase experiments. As shown in Fig. 3A, the classic secreted form of IgE is assembled first to an HL intermediate that is abundant as early as 5 min post-chase. It is later assembled into the H2L2 form that is detectable by 10 min post-chase and abundant within the cells by 20 min post-chase. Very similar kinetics are observed for the assembly of IgE grandé (Fig. 3C) and IgEtp (Fig. 3E). IgE grandé and IgEtp also assemble through an HL intermediate. In addition, for IgEtp, small quantities of H2 and H2L are observed intracellularly (Fig. 3E), and some H2 may be present in the secretions (band marked with asterisk in Fig. 3F). These assembly intermediates are minor components of the secreted protein and are below the level of detection in Fig. 2. In all experiments conducted with IgE classic, IgE grandé, and IgEtp, the intracellular H2L2 form migrates as a doublet (Fig. 3, A, C, and E), probably representing IgE at various stages of glycosylation, as the H2L2 form in the secretions migrates as a single band (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Pulse-chase experiments conducted with IgEψCH4 show the only detectable species in the cytoplasm to be light chain and species that migrate as HL half-molecules of IgEψCH4 (Fig. 3G). No free heavy chain is visible, and there is very little assembly to the H2L2 form. Fully assembled IgE classic, IgE grandé, and IgEtp are detectable in the secretions starting at 60 min post-chase (Fig. 3, B, D, and F). Quantitative analysis of the gels shown in Fig. 3 indicates that in the case of IgE classic and IgE grandé, approximately 25% of the total Ig produced during the 5-min pulse is secreted as H2L2 during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4A). Following reduction, the secreted proteins migrate as heavy and light chains of approximately 75 and 25 kDa (Fig. 2B and Fig. 5 and data not shown). IgEtp is the most efficiently secreted of the isoforms examined, with approximately 40% of the Ig secreted as H2L2 during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4A). HL is secreted in varying amounts for each of the isoforms examined (Fig. 3, B, D, F, and H). Secretion of small amounts of HL was also reported for IgE classic in the recent study by Batista et al.(8.Batista F.D. Efremov D.G. Burrone O.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of IgEψCH4 (Fig. 3H), the HL form constitutes the majority of IgE secreted by the transfectoma, with a smaller amount secreted as H2L. The efficiency of secretion of these two forms is shown in Fig. 4B and indicates that by 3 h after the pulse, approximately 20% of the labeled Ig is secreted in HL form, whereas only ~10% is secreted as H2L. All four transfectants synthesize excess light chain that is secreted as free L and as L2 dimers (Fig. 3, B, D, F, and H).Figure 5:Migration of 50- and 200-kDa co-precipitating species from the cytoplasm is unaffected by treatment with reducing agent. Cytoplasmic and secretion samples from the IgE grandé pulse-chase experiment were reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol. The IgE grandé in both cytoplasm and secretion reduces to a heavy chain of ~75 kDa and a light chain of ~25 kDa. The co-precipitating species from the cytoplasm, however, still migrate as 50 and 200 kDa following reduction. The 50-kDa light chain dimer in the secretions (see Fig. 3, B, D, and F) reduces to light chain.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W1595394351,"The specific pathway of tropoelastin secretion was investigated in fetal calf ligamentum nuchae (FCL) cells using brefeldin A (BFA) to disrupt the secretory pathway. Electron microscopic studies of BFA-treated FCL cells showed ultrastructural changes consistent with the reported effects of BFA on intracellular organelles. When FCL cells were labeled with [3H]leucine in the presence of BFA, radiolabeled tropoelastin was not secreted, nor was there an intracellular accumulation of the protein. In contrast, fibronectin accumulated within the cells in the presence of BFA. Northern analysis of mRNA levels in FCL cells showed that the message for tropoelastin was unaffected by BFA treatment. Pulse chase experiments conducted in the presence of BFA demonstrated that the tropoelastin retained within the cells was rapidly degraded. Ammonium chloride, nocodazole, and cycloheximide had no effect on the degradation of tropoelastin, indicating that the degradation did not involve the endosome/lysosome pathway, movement via microtubules, or a short-lived protein, respectively. Incubation of FCL cells with BFA in the presence of N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, however, allowed tropoelastin to steadily accumulate in the cells. Cells pulsed in the presence of BFA alone showed that tropoelastin initially accumulates within the cells for approximately 1 h prior to being degraded, thus indicating that a critical threshold of tropoelastin must be reached before degradation can occur. Results from this study provide evidence for selective degradation of a soluble secreted protein by a cysteine protease following retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Results from this study provide evidence for selective degradation of a soluble secreted protein by a cysteine protease following retention of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. The formation of elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix involves the secretion and subsequent alignment of tropoelastin monomers onto a microfibrillar scaffold where they then become cross-linked to form an insoluble elastin matrix. Ultrastructural studies have suggested that the secretion of tropoelastin occurs at specific sites on the cell surface(1.Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). This targeted secretion is thought to be mediated by an elastin receptor or chaperone complex that not only directs the secretion of tropoelastin but facilitates the assembly of the protein onto the developing elastic fibers at the cell surface(2.Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3.Mecham R.P. Hinek A. Entwistle R. Wrenn D.S. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 16652-16657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The definitive function of the elastin chaperone complex, however, has yet to be established. This is due, in large part, to the fact that very little is known concerning the intracellular events required for the trafficking and secretion of the tropoelastin monomer. Cell-free translation studies using tropoelastin mRNA have shown that the 70-kDa tropoelastin monomer contains a signal sequence of 24-26 residues(5.Karr S.R. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5946-5949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is cleaved as the completed polypeptide chain enters the ER( 1The abbreviations used are: ER endoplasmic reticulum BFA brefeldin A FCL fetal calf ligamentum nuchae HMG-CoA 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ALLN N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal NH4Cl ammonium chloride.)

Commun. 1988; 151: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). From the ER to the cell surface, tropoelastin remains unchanged with no glycosylation and little, if any, other post-translational modifications. Early attempts to explore the synthesis and secretion of tropoelastin, using morphological and cytochemical techniques, showed the presence of small vesicles in the vicinity of the Golgi and cell periphery that contained amorphous material with staining properties identical to that of elastin(8.Thyberg J. Hinek A. Nilsson J. Friberg U. Histochem. J. 1979; 11: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar material was also identified within the ER cisternae and Golgi saccules. Later studies, using immunoelectron microscopy, confirmed the presence of tropoelastin in elastogenic cells (9.Damiano V. Tsang A. Weinbaum G. Christner P. Rosenbloom J. Collagen Relat. Res. 1984; 4: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10.Daga-Gordini D. Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Volpin D. Histochem. J. 1987; 19: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); however, in many cases, the specific identity of the immunolabeled compartments was unclear. One approach to study the intracellular pathway of a secreted protein is to use drugs that affect protein trafficking at distinct sites along the secretory pathway. Since tropoelastin does not require any modifications within the Golgi, it was of interest to study the effect of brefeldin A (BFA) on the secretion of tropoelastin. Over the past several years, this fungal metabolite has been used extensively to block protein transport from the ER to the Golgi(11.Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Morphological studies have shown that in the presence of BFA, the Golgi apparatus disassembles and the ER becomes extensively dilated(12.Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki A. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y.

Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Since the effect of BFA on protein synthesis is minimal, secretory proteins tend to accumulate within the mixed ER/Golgi compartment(12.Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki A. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Magner J.A. Papagiannes E. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the effects of BFA have been shown to be completely reversible upon removal of the drug, with reassembly of the Golgi apparatus and resumed secretion(18.Alcalde J. Bonay P. Roa A. Vilaro S. Sandoval I.V. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In the present study, the secretion of tropoelastin was investigated in fetal calf ligamentum nuchae (FCL) cells. In fetal tissues, cells that are committed to elastogenesis can devote as much as 40% of their total protein synthesis to tropoelastin. Here we demonstrate that BFA treatment of FCL cells results in complete inhibition of tropoelastin secretion. It was expected that an intracellular accumulation of the protein would therefore occur; however, tropoelastin was found to be rapidly and selectively degraded in the ER. Although not well characterized, there is increasing evidence to support the existence of a pre-Golgi degradation pathway that is independent of lysosomes(20.Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Such a degradative system is required to dispose of proteins that are retained in the ER due to misfolding or failure to assemble into oligomeric complexes. In addition to abnormal proteins, several normal proteins also undergo ER degradation in a regulated manner, such as the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (21.Chun K.T. Bar-Nun S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22004-22010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Lecureux L.W. Wittenberg B.W. J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results from this study provide the first evidence of a BFA-induced degradation event mediated by a cysteine protease and provide supportive evidence for a selective process of “quality control” in the ER. The implications of these results, with respect to the intracellular events required for tropoelastin secretion and the general process of ER degradation, are discussed. Bovine ligamentum nuchae were obtained from late gestation fetuses at a local slaughterhouse. FCL fibroblasts were obtained from tissue explants and cultured as described previously (24.Mecham R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 232-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All experiments described in this report were with first passage cells from 230-270-day fetal nuchal ligaments. For all experiments, cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, antibiotics, and 10% fortified bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) prior to metabolic labeling. For metabolic labeling, L-[4,5-3H]leucine (1 mCi/ml) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Irvine, CA), and dialyzed fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. Protease inhibitors, ∊-amino-n-caproic acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma and used in the lysis buffer at final concentrations of 10, 5, and 5 mM, respectively. For immunoprecipitation experiments, a monoclonal tropoelastin antibody BA-4, raised to bovine α-elastin(25.Wrenn D.S. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. Mecham R.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a polyclonal fibronectin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used. Immune complexes were precipitated using heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin cells, Calbiochem) or protein A immobilized on Trisacryl (Pierce). Reagents used during metabolic labeling included ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN), BFA, cycloheximide, leupeptin, nocodazole, and pepstatin A (Sigma). NH4Cl was prepared fresh as a 2 M stock in distilled water and used at a final concentration of 20 mM. ALLN was stored at −20°C as a 10 mg/ml stock in ethanol and used at final concentration of 10 μg/ml. BFA and nocodazole were stored at −20°C as 10 mg/ml stocks in Me2SO and used at final concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. Cycloheximide and leupeptin were prepared fresh in distilled water as a 0.1 M stock, used at a final concentration of 0.5 mM, and as a 10 mM stock, used at a final concentration of 200 μM, respectively. Pepstatin A was prepared fresh as a 1 mg/ml stock in methanol and used at a final concentration of 10 μM. Confluent monolayers of FCL cells, grown in six-well tissue culture plates (Falcon number 3046, Baxter, McGaw Park, IL), were washed with leucine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and incubated in this medium for 1 h. Any pretreatment of cells with ALLN or nocodazole is as indicated in the text and figure legends. Each well of cells was metabolically labeled with 50 μCi of [3H]leucine in 1 ml of leucine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for various lengths of time as indicated. For pulse chase experiments, cells were rinsed twice with complete medium and chased in 1 ml of complete medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Following metabolic labeling, medium was collected, and cell layers were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. To each well, 1 ml of cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors was added. The culture dishes were placed on a platform shaker at 4°C, and cell lysates together with the detached cells were collected after 30 min. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the cell lysates were transferred to clean microfuge tubes. To determine total protein synthesis and secretion, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined from lysates and medium of cells metabolically labeled as indicated in the text. For each sample, 10 μl of lysate or medium was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 μl of this solution was spotted on dry glass microfiber filters (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR). After 30 min at 4°C in dishes flooded with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the filters were washed 3 × 5 min with room temperature 10% trichloroacetic acid and 1 × 5 min with 95% ethanol and left to dry prior to counting. For immunoprecipitation, medium and lysates were precleared by incubation with 10 μg/ml normal mouse IgG for 2 h and an additional 1 h with 25 μl of Staphylococcus aureus added to each tube. The Staphylococcus aureus was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants were transferred to clean tubes containing 100 μl of 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in lysis buffer and 10 μg of BA-4 antibody. Medium and lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. The following day, 40 μl of Staphylococcus aureus was added to each tube and incubated for 1 h at 4°C with gentle agitation. The immune complexes were pelleted, and the pellets were washed two times with lysis buffer and one time with nondetergent buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.5)). After the final wash, each pellet was resuspended in 35 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and incubated at 100°C for 6 min. The samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixed for 20 min, and treated with EN3HANCE (DuPont NEN) for 1 h. Gels were then dried and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). All immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted a minimum of three times to ensure reproducibility of results. Furthermore, in each experiment, one well of cells was always a control, with no treatment, in order to access the quality of labeling for that particular experiment and provide a direct comparison for the treated cells. Confluent cultures of FCL cells, plated in four-well Lab-Tek tissue culture chamber slides (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ), were incubated with 10 μg/ml BFA or 1 μl/ml Me2SO in complete medium for 4 h. Cell layers were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in situ with 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. After being washed several times with cacodylate buffer, the cell layers were treated sequentially with 1% osmium tetroxide in buffer, 2% tannic acid in buffer, and 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water. Cell layers were then dehydrated in a graded series of methanol to propylene oxide, infiltrated and embedded with Epon (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA). En face thin tissue sections were cut on a Reichert ultracut ultramicrotome and counterstained with methanolic uranyl acetate (26.Franc S. Garrone R. Bosch A. Franc J-M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1984; 32: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) followed by lead citrate(27.Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17502) Google Scholar). Sections were examined in a Ziess 902 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. Confluent cultures of FCL cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated for 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, or 4 h with 10 μg/ml BFA in complete medium. Control cultures were incubated for 1 h with an equal volume of Me2SO alone (1 μl/ml). Following incubation, total RNA was isolated from the cell layers by guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol extraction(28.Chomezynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62744) Google Scholar). RNA concentration and purity was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 1 M formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.), and hybridized and washed under stringent conditions as described previously(29.Parks W.C. Secrist H. Wu L.C. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes for this study were labeled with [α-32P]CTP (ICN, Irvine, CA) by random primed labeling. The tropoelastin probe was prepared from clone 12.1, a 2.2-kilobase bovine tropoelastin cDNA (30.Parks W.C. Roby J.D. Wu L.C. Grosso L.E. Matrix. 1992; 12: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The membrane was hybridized concurrently with the tropoelastin probe and a cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Hybridized complexes were detected by exposure of the membrane to X-OMAT AR film (Kodak). To characterize the normal secretion rate of tropoelastin in FCL cells, cells were pulsed for 10 min and the fate of that pulse was followed over the course of a 90-min chase. Counts of total trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins from the cell lysate and medium indicated that approximately 40 min passed before proteins began to be secreted (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this time course, a very faint band of immunoprecipitated tropoelastin appeared in the medium after 30 min of chase with a steady increase in band density thereafter (Fig. 1B). Since fibronectin binds directly to Staphylococcus aureus independent of any primary antibody (31.Kuusela P. Vartio T. Vuento M. Myhre E.B. Infect. Immun. 1984; 45: 433-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the use of Staphylococcus aureus to immunoprecipitate tropoelastin resulted in the presence of radiolabeled fibronectin on the autoradiographs as well as tropoelastin. The time course of fibronectin secretion was similar to that observed for tropoelastin. To verify that the bands at the top of the autoradiograph were indeed fibronectin, the cell lysate and medium from cells labeled for 4 h with [3H]leucine were divided into three equal aliquots and immunoprecipitated for fibronectin or tropoelastin using their respective primary antibodies followed by protein A to precipitate the immune complex or by using the tropoelastin antibody followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Fig. 2 shows that the mobility and relative intensity of the radiolabeled bands on autoradiographs from the samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibodies and recovered with protein A were identical to those observed using the tropoelastin antibody and Staphylococcus aureus.Figure 2:Fibronectin is immunoprecipitated with Staphylococcus aureus independent of fibronectin primary antibody. FCL cells were radiolabeled for 2 h with [3H]leucine, and the cell lysate and medium were divided into three equal aliquots. From one aliquot, fibronectin was immunoprecipitated with a specific primary antibody followed by protein A (lanes 1 and 2). Tropoelastin was immunoprecipitated from the other two aliquots with a tropoelastin antibody followed by either protein A (lanes 3 and 4) or Staphylococcus aureus (Staph A) (lanes 5 and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the intracellular pathway of tropoelastin secretion, FCL cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h with [3H]leucine in the presence of 10 μg/ml BFA, and the cell lysates and medium were immunoprecipitated for tropoelastin (Fig. 3). In the absence of BFA, radiolabeled tropoelastin was observed in both the cell lysate and medium. As expected with this length of pulse, the proportion of tropoelastin in the medium was greater than that present in the cell. Treatment of the cells with BFA during the pulse resulted in a complete inhibition of tropoelastin secretion. Although the tropoelastin was not secreted, no accumulation of tropoelastin was observed within the cells. In contrast, radiolabeled fibronectin accumulated in the cells following the inhibition of its secretion by BFA treatment. Since the BFA treatment did not result in an intracellular accumulation of tropoelastin, it was important to verify that the BFA treatment of FCL cells induced morphological changes that were characteristic of the reported effects of BFA on cell ultrastructure. FCL cells treated for 4 h with 1 μl/ml Me2SO alone showed no aberrant morphology. At one pole of the nucleus, numerous stacks of Golgi cisternae were observed surrounding the microtubule-organizing center (Fig. 4A). In contrast, cells treated with 10 μg/ml BFA in Me2SO for 4 h showed no recognizable Golgi structures (Fig. 4B). Instead, the Golgi region of these cells was occupied by an extensive array of tubulovesicular elements situated in the vicinity of the microtubule-organizing center. In addition to the Golgi apparatus, the cisternae of ER in FCL cells treated with BFA were also affected. In normal FCL cells, the ER is situated in the periphery of the cell and consists of small, slightly dilated cisternae (Fig. 5A). In BFA-treated cells, the ER is still peripherally located; however, the cisternae are grossly expanded and highly irregular in shape (Fig. 5B). This morphology is consistent with the reported accumulation of secreted proteins and retrograde fusion of Golgi elements into the ER that occur in BFA-treated cells(13.Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

Bar, 1.0 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to FCL cell ultrastructure, the general condition of the cells with respect to protein synthesis and secretion was investigated by measuring total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from lysates and medium of cells treated with 1 μl/ml Me2SO alone (control) or 10 μg/ml BFA over a 4-h time course. As shown in Fig. 6, the synthesis of total Triton X-100-extractable proteins, radiolabeled with [3H]leucine, was found to continue in both control and BFA-treated cells during the 4-h pulse. BFA treatment does, however, lead to a 19% reduction over control cells in the total trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts after 4 h of labeling. The treatment of FCL cells with 10 μg/ml BFA was sufficient to block total protein secretion for at least 4 h, while in control cells secretion of most radiolabeled proteins occurred after approximately 1 h of pulse and steadily continued for the 4-h time course. It has previously been reported that a time- and dose-dependent decrease in tropoelastin gene expression occurs in smooth muscle cells treated with monensin due to the repression of tropoelastin secretion (32.Frisch S.M. Davidson J.M. Werb Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, even though tropoelastin secretion was inhibited, the amount of radiolabeled tropoelastin in the lysate of BFA-treated FCL cells was actually less than that normally present in the secretory pathway of untreated cells after 4 h. This raised the possibility that a rapid down-regulation of tropoelastin gene expression might result as a consequence of an accumulation of tropoelastin in the ER during the initial stages of BFA treatment. To investigate this possibility, the effect of BFA treatment on mRNA levels of tropoelastin was investigated by Northern analysis. Fig. 7 shows that treatment of FCL cells for up to 4 h with 10 μg/ml BFA has no effect on mRNA levels for tropoelastin. Since the synthesis of tropoelastin appears to continue during BFA treatment, the lack of any accumulation of the protein in the cell was hypothesized to be a result of intracellular degradation. To study this possibility, FCL cells were pulsed for 1 h in the presence of BFA and then chased in complete medium still containing BFA in order to follow the fate of the radiolabeled tropoelastin trapped within the cell. After 1.5 h of chase, the amount of radiolabeled tropoelastin immunoprecipitated from the cells was found to be less than half of the original amount, and by 3 h of chase, little or no radiolabeled tropoelastin could be detected in the cell lysate (Fig. 8). In contrast, the amount of fibronectin that was initially radiolabeled during the 1 h pulse remained unchanged during the 3-h chase. These results indicate that the tropoelastin trapped in the fused ER/Golgi compartment is rapidly and selectively degraded. To characterize the nature of the protease responsible for the degradation of tropoelastin, several protease inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit the BFA-induced degradation. In a degradation assay similar to that shown in Fig. 8, the cysteine protease inhibitor, ALLN, was found to completely inhibit the degradation of tropoelastin when included in the chase together with BFA following the 1-h pulse (Fig. 9A). Since it has been demonstrated that ALLN inhibits the activity of the lysosomal proteases, cathepsin L and cathepsin B(33.Hiwasa T. Sawada T. Sakiyama S. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) , the ability of lysosomotropic agents to inhibit degradation was also tested. NH4Cl, which raises intracellular pH and thus inhibits acid proteases in endosome/lysosome degradative pathway, did not inhibit the rapid degradation of tropoelastin in BFA-treated cells (Fig. 9A). Similarly, leupeptin, a reversible inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases and most cysteine proteases, and pepstatin A, an aspartic protease inhibitor, had no effect on tropoelastin degradation (not shown). Studies on the ER degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and T-cell receptor α subunit have shown that the degradation of both proteins is inhibited by ALLN, but only HMG-CoA reductase degradation is prevented by cycloheximide(34.Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of inhibiting protein synthesis by cycloheximide on tropoelastin stability was tested. Fig. 9A shows that the presence of cycloheximide in the chase following the 1-h pulse had no effect on the rate of tropoelastin degradation. This result suggests that de novo protein synthesis is not needed for the tropoelastin to be degraded, and thus a short-lived protein is not required for the degradation event. Although it is well documented that BFA treatment results in the retention of secreted proteins in the"

Histo- and immunochemical staining of transgenic tissue sections showed that the longer transgene was expressed in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney, enterocytes located in small intestine villi and liver parenchymal cells. In the liver, a maximal expression was observed in perivenous hepatocytes, while the transgene was weakly active in periportal hepatocytes, which reproduced the pattern of functional zonation already reported for other glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes in the liver. We also established that the transgene retained the necessary elements for a correct chronological expression during development but was lacking elements necessary for activation by high carbohydrate diet. Instead, transgene expression was paradoxically stimulated in fasted animals, suggesting that the endogenous gene, which must be active under both glycolytic and gluconeogenic conditions, could possess distinct elements activating it in fasted as well as in carbohydrate-fed animals; the former element might be conserved in the transgene and the latter one might be lost.

Aldolase B is the isoform of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, which is specific to hepatocytes, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and enterocytes, where it plays an essential role in fructose metabolism. Indeed, aldolase B is much more active on fructose 1-phosphate resulting from fructose phosphorylation by fructokinase than the other two aldolase isoforms, aldolase C (specific to the brain) and aldolase A (ubiquitous and very active in the muscle). In addition, aldolase B activity is required in gluconeogenic organs for both glycolysis (hydrolysis of fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into trioses) and gluconeogenesis (condensation of triosephosphates into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate). In humans, aldolase B deficiency is responsible for hereditary fructose intolerance, a recessive autosomal disease characterized by hypoglycemia and clotting disorders upon fructose feeding. In the liver, aldolase B progressively replaces aldolase A (and, to a lesser extent, aldolase C) during fetal development, becoming practically the only isoform in postnatal hepatocytes (Schapira et al., 1975; Numazaki et al., 1984). Aldolase B gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional level during development and cell differentiation and is also subjected to a transcriptional regulation by diet and hormones; transcription is activated about 4-fold by fasting rats fed a high glucose/fructose diet and is inhibited by fasting, glucagon, and cyclic AMP (Munnich et al., 1985; Weber et al., 1984). The 200-base pair proximal promoter fragment of the aldolase B gene contains binding sites for ubiquitous and liver-enriched transcriptional factors, especially for proteins of the CAAT/enhancer binding protein family, hepatocyte nuclear factors 1 and 3 (HNF1 ( 1The abbreviations used are: HNF hepatocyte nuclear factor CAT chloramphenicol acetyltransferase DIG digoxigenin PBS phosphate-buffered saline.) and HNF3). The HNF1 and HNF3 binding sites overlap each other, and their occupancy is mutually exclusive, HNF1 being a transcriptional activator whose effect is counteracted by HNF3 (Grégori et al., 1993, 1994). This competition between HNF1 and HNF3 could explain why the activity of this promoter tested by transient expression is very weak in hepatocytes and hepatoma cells (Grégori et al., 1991, 1994). In HepG2 hepatoma cells, activity of the aldolase B promoter is stimulated about 50-fold by an intronic element, termed element B, located in a fragment spanning from nucleotides 650 to 2448 (Grégori et al., 1991). In the present paper, we show that this element is absolutely required for the expression in transgenic mice of constructs in which the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene is put under the control of aldolase B regulatory regions (aldolase B/CAT constructs). This tissue-specific expression has been more precisely analyzed by in situ detection of the CAT protein using immunological and enzymatic methods whose performances are compared. The expression of the transgene was localized to proximal tubules of the kidney, enterocytes in the upper region of intestine villi, and in the liver to pericentrolobular hepatocytes. The maps of the different transgenes analyzed are shown in Fig. 1. The 232ABC/CAT and 232A600/CAT transgenes were derived from previously described constructs (2200ABC/CAT and 2200A/CAT) (Grégori et al., 1991) by XbaI digestion at position −232. The transgene 232A100/CAT was derived from 232A600/CAT by PstI digestion cutting at position +197 and subcloning into the VB8 CAT vector. The transgene 232A100B/CAT was derived from 232A100/CAT by cloning blunt-ended HindIII fragment B into the SmaI site of this construct. The 1600ABC/CAT, 1600AB/CAT and 1600 AC/CAT fragments were isolated from the previously described (Grégori et al., 1991) 2200/ABC/CAT, 2200/AB/CAT and 2200/AC/CAT constructs, respectively, by a ClaI digestion (Fig. 1). The 232ABC/CAT, 232A600/CAT, 232A100/CAT, and 232A100B/CAT fragments were isolated from 232ABC, 232A600, 232A100, and 232A100B constructs, respectively, using the AflIII and ClaI sites in the vector. After electrophoresis in 0.8% (w/v) GTG-seakem agarose gel (Life Technologies, Inc.), fragments were electroeluted and purified by using elutip-d columns (Schleicher & Schuell). 3-10 ng of fragment diluted in a 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA buffer was microinjected into fertilized B6D2 mouse eggs according to (Gordon and Ruddle, 1983). Transgenic founders and offsprings were identified by Southern blot, and transgene copy numbers were estimated by quantitative analysis on a phosphorimager system (Molecular Dynamics). CAT assays were performed with 0.001-100 μg of F1 animal tissue extract proteins (liver, kidney, small intestine, spleen, and brain) according to Gorman et al.(1982). The animals were fasted for 24 h and then either fasted for an additional 18-h period or refed during this period with a high carbohydrate diet (Weber et al., 1984). Mice were sacrificed, and livers were stored at −80°C until use. RNAs were isolated from tissues by lysis in guanidium chloride, followed by phenol extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Cuif et al. (1992). The aldolase B probe used was a 379-base pair mouse aldolase B cDNA fragment amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and then cloned in pBluescript plasmid. The CAT probe was isolated by ClaI-EcoRI digestion of the PeCAT vector (Grégori et al., 1991). The 18 S R45 ribosomal probe was used as a standard for RNA quantification (Concordet et al., 1993). Transgenic and non-transgenic (wild type) mice of line 7 were perfused under anesthesia using cardiac puncture with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 (Biomérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) (Kim et al., 1993). The intestinal tract (proximal and distal jejunum), liver, and kidneys were subsequently removed immediately after sacrifice and fixed by immersion in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7, for 1 h at +4°C. Fixed tissues were then rinsed in PBS, cryoprotected by immersion in sucrose (10% (wt/vol) sucrose in PBS for 1 h, then 30% sucrose in PBS overnight, both at 4°C), and then frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Tissue blocks were cross-sectioned at 7 μm in a cryostat, and sections were mounted on slides (Super Frost/Plus, CML, Nemours, France), air dried, and processed for immunochemical or histochemical staining without any further fixation. Rabbit polyclonal affinity-purified antibody to CAT (Miskimins et al., 1992) were purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Paoli, PA). Anti-rabbit IgG-digoxigenin (DIG), F(ab′)2 fragments from sheep, anti DIG-peroxidase, F(ab) fragments, and anti-DIG-fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). Tissue sections were exposed to a 1/1000 dilution for anti-CAT antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and rinsed three times in PBS. Sections were then treated with anti-rabbit-DIG antibody (1/400 dilution) for 30 min and rinsed three times in PBS; this was then followed by either anti-DIG-fluorescein isothiocyanate or anti-DIG-peroxidase (1/400 dilution). Sections labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate were mounted with Vectashield (Vector, Biosys, Compiègne, France) and immediately observed with an epifluorescence microscope. Anti-DIG-peroxidase antibody was revealed with diaminobenzidine solution (10 mg/15 ml in presence of H2O2 (1/10000)) for 15 min, rinsed in PBS, and mounted after dehydration and clarification. Control sections were obtained by omission of the anti-CAT antibody and by using complete technique on wild type tissues. CAT activity was revealed using the Donoghue et al. technique(1991, 1992). Briefly, sections were incubated for 4-24 h with a mixture that contained 0.3 mM acetyl-CoA (lithium salt; Pharmacia Biotech, Paris), 4 mM chloramphenicol (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France), 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM sodium citrate, 3 mM copper sulfate, and 63 mM of Sorensen's phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. They were then rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted. Control slides were obtained by omission of acetyl-CoA or chloramphenicol in the mixture or by using the complete mixture on non-transgenic tissues. Between two and four lines of each of the seven aldolase B/CAT transgenes tested were obtained, except for the 232A100/CAT transgene present in one line only (Table 1). CAT activity was determined in tissue extracts from 3-month-old transgenic mice harboring between 2 and 100 copies of the transgenes per cell. The main result of these studies in transgenic mice is that the intronic element B is indispensable to the expression of the transgenes; 1600AB/CAT, 232ABC/CAT, 1600AB/CAT, and 232A100B/CAT transgenes are expressed in the liver and kidney of most transgenic lines while no 1600AC/CAT, 232A600/CAT, and 232A100/CAT transgenes were active in any line. These latter results confirmed previous, non-published data from our laboratory, namely that different types of transgenes directed by up to 2000 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequence of the aldolase B gene were totally inactive in transgenic mice. Therefore, the intronic element B, which is able to stimulate about 50-fold the activity of the promoter in transiently transfected HepG2 cells (Grégori et al., 1991) is also an indispensable element for tissue-specific and high level expression of the aldolase B transgene in vivo. Such a cooperation between a proximal promoter and a distal enhancer to ensure a correct expression of transgenes has been described for other genes, e.g. the albumin gene (Pinkert et al., 1987) and the apolipoprotein gene (Brooks et al., 1994).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab However, the element B is clearly insufficient to confer on the transgenes an expression dependent on the number of integration copies and independent of site, which is to say to behave as a locus control region (Grosveld et al., 1987; Fraser et al., 1990). Indeed, the CAT activity directed by a same transgene is highly variable in different lines and is not dependent on the transgene copy number. In two lines, the expression of the 232ABC/CAT (line 14) and 232A100B/CAT (line 52) transgenes is even nil in the liver and ectopically stimulated in the spleen. Therefore, even in the presence of the element B, expression of the transgenes is highly influenced by the integration site, which indicates that they contain neither locus control region nor so-called “insulators” (Bode and Maas, 1988; Kalos and Fournier, 1995; Phi-Van et al., 1990) able to protect transgenes from the influence of neighbor regulatory elements. Nevertheless, except for the two lines mentioned above, the transgenes with a B element are at least 100-fold more expressed in the liver and kidney than in the brain and spleen. The CAT activity in small intestine extracts seemed to be in the nonspecific range, but this could be due to artifacts, for instance to proteolytic degradation of the CAT protein in extracts contaminated with pancreatic secretions or to dilution of expressing cells by abundant non-expressing tissue, because the CAT protein was well detected in some enterocytes by immunohistochemical and histological techniques (see below). Expression of the aldolase B gene in the liver is developmentally regulated; the mRNA is undetectable before day 14 of gestation, and from that stage to adult it was estimated to increase about 9-fold (Numazaki et al., 1984; Schapira et al., 1975). Using the line 7 expressing the 1600ABC/CAT transgene at a high level, we observed that developmental regulation of transgene expression mimics that of the endogenous aldolase B gene (Table 2). Therefore, the transgene contains the elements required for a correct regulation of aldolase B gene expression during development.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Since the 1600ABC/CAT transgene was that containing most potentially regulatory sequences of the aldolase B gene, we used mice of line 7, expressing this transgene at a high level, for an immunohistochemical analysis of CAT transgene expression. Fluorescence or diaminobenzidine staining was equivalent on all transgenic tissues examined with a cytoplasmic and occasionally nuclear positivity. No positivity was noted in all controls. Positivity of transgenic tissues consisted of a cytoplasmic granular brown precipitate. In addition, some nuclei were strongly stained in transgenic tissue. Nevertheless, in transgenic and wild type tissues, some nuclei were occasionally weakly stained, indicating that this nuclear staining is not specific, as already described (Donoghue et al., 1991, 1992). No cytoplasmic positivity was noted in controls. Both immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques showed exactly the same cellular and tissue pattern of positivity. In the liver (Fig. 2, a and b), positive hepatocytes were localized in the central region with a perivenular ring distribution. Very rare positive hepatocytes were also seen in the periportal area. No positivity was observed in vascular cells, Küpfer cells, epithelial bile duct cells, and portal connective tissue. In the kidney (Fig. 2, c and d), the epithelial cells of the first two convoluted parts of the proximal tubule (S1 and S2) and the capsular epithelium (Bowman's parietal cells) of the glomerulus were positive for CAT with either histochemistry or immunohistochemistry. Nuclei staining was particularly strong in the S2 segment. No other kidney cell was positive for CAT. Jejunum immunostaining revealed a 50% positivity of villi enterocytes, with no staining of Lieberkühn crypts (Fig. 2, e and f). There was no positivity in the lamina propria. CAT histochemistry disclosed the same pattern of positivity in a weak manner. These patterns of immuno- and histochemical labeling of the aldolase B/CAT transgene product are consistent with previous results using anti-aldolase B specific antibodies for detecting the enzyme in various tissues (Schapira et al., 1975). However, the pattern of extreme zonation of transgene expression, detected in perivenous hepatocytes and in rare periportal hepatocytes, was not observed before with anti-aldolase B antibodies. ( 2A. Hatzfeld, personal communication.) As mentioned before, aldolase B activity is reversible, acting in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. As a glycolytic enzyme, it could be expected to be mainly expressed in the centrolobular region, as is glucokinase (Trus et al., 1980), pyruvate kinase (Miethke et al., 1985), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Welsh, 1972), and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Hildebrand, 1980). However, as a gluconeogenic enzyme, it could also be present in periportal hepatocytes synthesizing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Miethke et al., 1985), fructose 1,6- bisphosphatase (Katz et al., 1977), and glucose 6-phosphatase (Miethke et al., 1985). The molecular bases for the metabolic zonation of liver parenchyma are not well known. They could include transcriptional and post-transcriptional events controlled by hormone and oxygen gradients, innervation, cell-cell interactions etc. (Jungerman, 1988; Kuo and Darnell, 1991). The apparent discrepancy between zonation of 1600ABC/CAT transgene expression and the inapparent zonation of in vivo aldolase B activity could result from the in vivo stability of aldolase B contrasting with the lower stability of the CAT enzyme. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that the special pattern of expression of the transgene in the liver lobule reflects the lack of some important cis-acting element(s) in the transgene, as evidenced by the strong dependence on the site of integration. In any case, further analyses of the aldolase B promoter and enhancers will be required to determine the role of these regulatory regions in the observed restriction of transgene expression to perivenous hepatocytes. Fig. 3 shows that the response of endogenous aldolase B mRNA and transgenic CAT mRNA to fasting and refeeding glucose were practically inverse; while, as expected (Weber et al., 1984; Munnich et al., 1985), the abundance of the aldolase B messenger increased when fasted rats were fed a high carbohydrate diet, the abundance of the transgenic CAT mRNA decreased under the same conditions. The first hypothesis for explaining this paradoxical response of the transgene relies on the absence of some cis-acting element(s) in the transgene and on the duality of the aldolase B functions in the opposite pathways, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. In other words, it seems that the transgene lacks a positive glucose response element, perhaps similar to that characterized in the promoter of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene (Bergot et al., 1992; Diaz-Guerra et al., 1993), or in a distal upstream region of the spot 14 gene (Shih and Towle, 1994). However, it could retain an element whose role is to ensure a persistence of aldolase B synthesis under gluconeogenic dietary conditions, while purely glycolytic genes, such as the L-type pyruvate kinase gene, are totally extinguished (Weber et al., 1984; Vaulont et al., 1986). This hypothesis is in line with the observation that the L-pyruvate kinase glucose response element (L-PK GlRE) behaved, in transfected hepatocytes, as a positive element in the presence of glucose but also as a negative element in the absence of glucose or in the presence of glucagon (Bergot et al., 1992). If such an element exists in the endogenous aldolase B gene but not in the transgene, this could account for both absence of positive response to glucose and sustained expression in fasted animals, while a different element could account for the stimulation of transgene expression during fasting. The aldolase B gene needs to be expressed in vivo with an intronic activator cooperating with its tissue-specific promoter. These elements are sufficient to confer on a CAT reporter transgene a correct tissue-specific expression in the kidney, small intestine, and liver plus (in the liver) a drastic restriction of the expression to hepatocytes around the centrolobular vein. However, the physiological stimulation of the gene by a carbohydrate-rich diet was replaced by the opposite phenomenon, that is to say a stimulation in fasted animals. This paradoxical dietary response of the transgene suggests that the aldolase B gene, which must be expressed under both glycolytic and gluconeogenic conditions, could contain different elements stimulating transcription in either conditions. The glucose response element would be lacking in the transgene while the element enhancing transcription during fasting would be present."
https://openalex.org/W1552834834,"Increased expression of the transcription factor Spi-1 (PU.1) results from retroviral insertion in nearly all Friend spleen focus-forming virus-transformed murine erythroleukemia cell lines and exposure of these cells to Me2SO, induces their differentiation and decreases Spi-1 mRNA level by 4-5-fold. While these results suggest that alterations in Spi-1 expression have significant effects on erythroblast growth and differentiation, neither the cause nor the effect of the decrease in Spi-1 expression that follows Me2SO exposure has been established. The experiments described here demonstrate that the effect of inducers on Spi-1 expression is regulated post-transcriptionally. Nuclear run-off transcriptions demonstrated that Spi-1 transcription was not decreased following Me2SO exposure. Additionally, expression of a recombinant Spi-1 mRNA under transcriptional control of a constitutively active Rous sarcoma virus promoter was regulated identically to endogenous Spi-1 mRNA. The ability of Me2SO to destabilize Spi-1 mRNA was selective, as the stability of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 were not similarly effected. The effect of Me2SO on the stability of Spi-1 mRNA provides a novel means of altering gene expression in these cells and is likely to have significance for the differentiation of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044733424,"Chronic dietary phosphate restriction is associated with up-regulation of sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) cotransport by renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in association with increases in Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA and protein. We investigated whether changes in cytosolic calcium mediate this adaptive response in opossum kidney cells, a continuous line of renal epithelial cells. After 24 h of phosphate depletion, steady-state cytosolic calcium levels were increased; this increase was observed at physiologic levels of phosphate restriction and was prevented by the calcium channel blocker verapamil. Chronic phosphate depletion was also associated with parallel increases in Na/Pi cotransport activity, Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA, and Na/Pi cotransporter protein, all of which were blocked in verapamil-treated cells. Actinomycin D, at a dose that prevented the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA during phosphate depletion, also prevented the increase in Na/Pi cotransport activity. Incubation with the calcium ionophore ionomycin or A23187 reproduced the increase in Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA in phosphate-replete cells. Conversely, chelation of cytosolic calcium by quin-2/AM prevented the increase in Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA in phosphate-depleted cells. The effect of an increase in cytosolic calcium was specific for the Na/Pi cotransporter as mRNA levels for the sodium-dependent glucose transporter were not affected. Our observations suggest that chronic phosphate restriction increases steady-state cytosolic calcium, which, in turn, increases transcription of Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA, thereby stimulating Na/Pi cotransport activity.

Chronic dietary Pi restriction results in widespread changes in the physiologic function of multiple cell types. These include impaired insulin secretion in pancreatic islet cells, impaired norepinephrine metabolism in synaptosomes, and impaired phagocytosis in polymorphonuclear cells(1.Massry S.G. Hajjar S.M.

In vivo administration of the calcium channel blocker verapamil to rats during chronic dietary Pi restriction prevents both the increase in cytosolic calcium as well as the characteristic physiologic changes(1.Massry S.G.

These observations suggest that an increase in cytosolic calcium is an important cellular mediator of many physiologic changes associated with phosphate restriction. Chronic Pi deprivation is also associated with an increase in Pi reabsorption by the kidney, which is mediated by a specific, membrane-bound sodium-dependent phosphate (Na/Pi) ( 1The abbreviations used are: Na/Pi sodium-dependent phosphate OK opossum kidney PCR polymerase chain reaction SGT sodium-dependent glucose transporter.) cotransporter in the proximal tubule (4.Murer H.

On the basis of these previous investigations, we hypothesized that chronic Pi restriction increases cytosolic calcium in renal tubular epithelial cells and that this change, in turn, produces the observed increases in Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA, protein, and transport activity. Opossum kidney (OK) cells, a continuous line of renal epithelial cells, are a useful experimental model for investigation of the cellular mechanisms involved in the adaptation to Pi restriction, in isolation from the multiple systemic changes associated with in vivo Pi deprivation (4.Murer H.

In addition, we have raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against NaPi-4 protein (12.Saxena S. Dansby L. Allon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to enable direct measurements of NaPi-4 protein levels. We have recently demonstrated in OK cells parallel increases in Na/Pi cotransport activity, Na/Pi cotransporter NaPi-4 mRNA, and NaPi-4 protein during chronic Pi restriction(12.Saxena S. Dansby L. Allon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), similar to the changes observed in Pi-deprived rats(6.Levi M. Lotscher M. Sorribas V. Custer M.

Using the newly available molecular tools and the NaPi-4 antibody, we investigated whether an increase in cytosolic calcium might mediate the increases in NaPi-4 mRNA, NaPi-4 protein, and Na/Pi cotransport activity associated with chronic Pi restriction of OK cells. Specifically, we addressed three experimental questions. 1) Do maneuvers that prevent the increase in cytosolic calcium during Pi depletion (calcium channel blockers or calcium chelators) prevent the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA? 2) Do other experimental maneuvers that increase cytosolic calcium in Pi-replete cells (calcium ionophores) also produce an increase in NaPi-4 mRNA? 3) Are the effects of cytosolic calcium specific for NaPi-4 mRNA? OK cells were a gift of Judith Cole (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO). Culture media and dishes were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fura-2/AM was from Teflabs (Austin, TX). The verapamil enantiomers S(-)-verapamil and R(+)-verapamil were from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) kits for developing the Western blots were from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Peptide N-glycosidase F was from Boehringer Mannheim. Multi-antigen peptides for antibody production were synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). PCR primers were synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). All isotopes were from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were from Sigma. OK cells were grown on 35-mm culture dishes in minimum essential medium with the addition of 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. They were kept in an incubator at 37°C with 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium was changed every other day. At weekly intervals, the cells were detached from the plates with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA and subcultured at a 1:10 dilution. Pi transport was measured as previously reported by us(13.Allon M. Parris M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F404-F410PubMed Google Scholar). After reaching confluence, the cells were rendered quiescent by a 16-h incubation with serum-free minimum essential medium containing 1 mM Pi and 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium containing normal or low Pi concentrations. After aspirating the medium and washing, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 min with transport solution (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 14.0 mM HEPES, and 0.1 mM K2H32PO4, pH 7.4). The transport solution was aspirated; the cells were washed three times with ice-cold 137 mM NaCl and 14 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, to stop phosphate uptake; and 32P uptake was quantified by scintillation counting. Sodium-independent Pi uptake was determined by substituting 137 mMN-methylglucamine chloride for NaCl in the transport solution. Sodium-dependent cotransport was calculated as the difference in Pi uptake with and without sodium. After the appropriate preincubation, the cells were detached with EDTA, resuspended in serum-free medium, and loaded with Fura-2/AM for 40 min at room temperature. They were washed and resuspended in balanced salt solution (127 mM NaCl, 3.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). The cells were transferred to 2-ml plastic cuvettes, continuously stirred at room temperature, and excited alternatively at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, with fluorescence emission measured at 510 nm, using a Photon Technology International Delta scanner. Cytosolic calcium was calculated from the ratio of emissions at the two excitation wavelengths, as previously validated in OK cells(14.Miyauchi A. Dobre V. Rickmeyer M. Cole J. Forte L. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F485-F493PubMed Google Scholar). The calcium channel blocker verapamil was used to prevent the increase in cytosolic calcium during Pi depletion. In addition, we used two biologically active enantiomers of verapamil: S(-)-verapamil, which also blocks calcium channels, and R(+)-verapamil, which does not(15.Weir M.R. Peppler R. Gomolka D. Handwerger B.S. Transplantation (Baltimore). 1992; 54: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In some studies, the calcium ionophores ionomycin and A23187 were used to increase cytosolic calcium(16.Kauffman R.F. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2735-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Weinstock R.S. Saville C.M. Messina J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E519-E525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, the calcium chelator quin-2/AM was used to prevent an increase in cytosolic calcium (17.Weinstock R.S. Saville C.M. Messina J.L. Am. J.

After reverse transcription-PCR of OK cell RNA, forward (5′-TCC AGC ACA TCT ACC TCC ATC ATC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGT GGG GTA ATG GCT GAA GTG AAC-3′) primers were used to synthesize a probe for NaPi-4 mRNA. The 0.8-kilobase PCR product was sequenced by a dye-labeled dideoxynucleotide sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Inc.), and homology to the published NaPi-4 cDNA sequence (11.Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed. The NaPi-4 PCR fragment was radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming and hybridized with OK cell RNA using Northern analysis. Total RNA was isolated from OK cells by the guanidium isothiocyanate method(18.Chomcyznski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar), purified by phenol and chloroform extraction, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and washed with 70% ethanol. Total RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry, denatured with 37% formaldehyde, separated on 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After baking the membranes at 80°C for 2 h, the blots were prehybridized at 42°C with 5 × SSPE (sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA buffer), 2% SDS, and 50% formamide. After hybridization with the NaPi-4 probe, the membrane was washed twice at room temperature with 2 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS, followed by one wash at room temperature with 0.5 × SSPE and 0.2% SDS and one wash at 42°C with 0.4 × SSPE and 0.2% SDS. The blots were exposed to Kodak X-AR film, and the bands were quantified by densitometry. NaPi-4 cDNA hybridized with Northern blots from OK cell RNA detected a single band at ∽2.5 kilobases, comparable in size to NaPi-4 mRNA (11.Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether Pi depletion nonspecifically induces the transcription of genes for other cell membrane-bound transporters, we also measured mRNA levels for the renal sodium-dependent glucose transporter (SGT). Forward (5′-AGC-TCA-TTC-GCA-ATG-CAG-CC-3′) and reverse (5′-TGT-CCG-TGT-AAA-TCA-CCG-CC-3′) primers to the published sequence of the human SGT cDNA (19.Hediger M.A. Coady M.J. Ikeda T.S. Wright E.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) (at sites of homology to the rabbit and rat SGT cDNAs) were selected with the MacVector software program and synthesized commercially. Following reverse transcription-PCR of OK cell RNA, this primer pair was used to make a ∽600-base pair probe. Sequencing of this probe established >90% homology to the human SGT sequence. When this probe was hybridized with OK cell RNA Northern blots, it detected a single ∽2.8-kilobase signal, representing OK cell SGT mRNA(12.Saxena S. Dansby L. Allon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To provide a reference for total RNA per lane, the Northern blots were stripped and rehybridized with a probe for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase “housekeeping gene.” Degenerate forward (5′-AA(A/G)-TGG-GGT-GAT-GCT-GGT-GC(C/T)-G-3′) and reverse (5′-CAT-GCC-AGT-GAG-(C/T)TT-CCC-GTT-C-3′) primer pairs for the rat, rabbit, and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs (20.Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar) were a kind gift of James Schafer (Department of Physiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham). After reverse transcription-PCR of OK cell RNA, these primers were used to synthesize a ∽400-base pair probe. Sequencing of the PCR fragment revealed a ∽90% homology to the published sequence for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. When this probe was hybridized with OK cell RNA Northern blots, it detected a single ∽1.4-kilobase signal, representing the OK cell glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA(12.Saxena S. Dansby L. Allon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 8-amino acid peptide RSPARLPK (amino acids 566-573) from the published amino acid sequence of NaPi-4 (11.Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was found to have both high hydrophilic and antigenic indices, making it a promising epitope for the generation of antibodies. Multi-antigen peptides were synthesized, with the peptide coupled to polylysine to increase its immunogenicity. Rabbits were immunized with 1 mg of multi-antigen peptides suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant, followed by booster multi-antigen peptide injections suspended in Freund's incomplete adjuvant at 4 and 6 weeks. Blood samples obtained 10 days after the second booster revealed high antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the antisera of three of the four rabbits. The antibodies were precipitated from the antiserum with 50% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The precipitate was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6. The dialysate was passed three times through an affinity column coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG. Further purification of the antibody was performed by passing the eluate through a second affinity column to which the NaPi-4 peptide was bound. Antibody bound to the column was then eluted and dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6. The final purified antibody was used to probe the Western blots from OK cell crude membrane protein. OK cells were scraped into 5 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, and homogenized with a syringe through an 18-gauge needle. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (5 min at 1000 rpm). The supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 × g at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 mM mannitol/Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, with addition of the following protease inhibitors: 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 μM pepstatin, and 1 μM aprotinin. The crude membrane preparation was frozen in liquid nitrogen until future use. It was then thawed, boiled with SDS sample buffer, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti-NaPi-4 antibody. Finally, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The Western blots were developed using the ECL kit. The purified rabbit polyclonal anti-NaPi-4 antibody detected an intense band at ∽70 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of NaPi-4 protein(11.Sorribas V. Markovich D. Hayes G. Stange G. Forgo J. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This band was eliminated when the antibody was preincubated with the NaPi-4 peptide (data not shown). A second band at ∽84 kDa was eliminated when the crude membrane preparation was deglycosylated by an 18-h incubation at 37°C with peptide N-glycosidase F (data not shown), suggesting that it represents the glycosylated form of NaPi-4, analogous to the glycosylated form of the rat Na/Pi cotransporter (NaPi-2) (21.Hayes G. Busch A. Lotscher M. Waldegger S. Lang F. Verrey F. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24143-24149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the phosphate transport characteristics are similar for glycosylated and deglycosylated NaPi-2 protein(21.Hayes G. Busch A. Lotscher M. Waldegger S. Lang F. Verrey F. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24143-24149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we deglycosylated the crude membrane preparation prior to loading subsequent gels so as to quantify total NaPi-4 protein. An additional (weaker) band detected at ∽51 kDa probably represents a degradation product of NaPi-4 protein. Incubation of OK cells in a Pi-free medium for 24 h was associated with an approximate doubling of steady-state cytosolic calcium levels, as compared with Pi-replete cells (Fig. 1). This change was not limited to total Pi depletion; rather, progressive Pi restriction within the physiologic range was associated with progressive increases in cytosolic calcium (Fig. 1A). The calcium channel blocker verapamil prevented the increase in cytosolic calcium in Pi-depleted cells, without affecting steady-state cytosolic calcium levels in cells incubated with 1 mM Pi (Fig. 1B). S(-)-Verapamil reproduced the effect of verapamil on cytosolic calcium, whereas R(+)-verapamil did not, confirming the specificity of the former enantiomer for the calcium channel. Incubation of OK cells in a 0 mM Pi medium for 24 h was associated with a significant increase in Na/Pi cotransport activity, as compared with cells incubated with 1 mM Pi (Fig. 2A). Chronic Pi depletion was also associated with parallel increases in NaPi-4 mRNA and protein, as compared with Pi-replete cells (Fig. 2B and 3). Verapamil completely prevented the increases in NaPi-4 mRNA, NaPi-4 protein, and Na/Pi cotransport activity in Pi-depleted cells, without affecting any of these parameters in Pi-replete cells. S(-)-Verapamil reproduced the inhibitory effects of verapamil, whereas R(+)-verapamil did not. Further experiments were performed to determine whether gene transcription was required for the chronic adaptation to phosphate depletion. Actinomycin D (0.25 μg/ml), an inhibitor of DNA transcription, completely abolished the increase in Na/Pi cotransport during chronic (24 h) Pi depletion (Fig. 4A). Parallel Northern analysis confirmed that this dose of actinomycin prevented an increase in NaPi-4 mRNA levels during Pi depletion (Fig. 4B). Additional studies were performed to evaluate whether other experimental maneuvers that increase cytosolic calcium reproduce the effect of Pi depletion on the Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA. The calcium ionophores ionomycin and A23187 both increased NaPi-4 mRNA levels in OK cells incubated with 1 mM Pi, without affecting mRNA levels for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase housekeeping gene (Fig. 5). Moreover, neither ionophore changed mRNA levels for an unrelated membrane-bound transporter, the sodium-dependent glucose transporter. Interestingly, there was no additive effect between Pi depletion and the calcium ionophores on NaPi-4 mRNA levels in OK cells. Additional studies demonstrated that the calcium chelator quin-2/AM could prevent the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA during Pi depletion of OK cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, the calcium chelator did not affect mRNA levels for the sodium-dependent glucose transporter. Using OK cells, an experimental model for renal epithelial cells, we have demonstrated parallel increases in cytosolic calcium and Na/Pi cotransporter NaPi-4 mRNA during chronic (24 h) phosphate depletion. These observations suggest that an increase in cytosolic calcium mediates the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-restricted OK cells. Alternatively, Pi depletion may increase cytosolic calcium and NaPi-4 mRNA by two independent cellular mechanisms. To establish causality between the changes in cytosolic calcium and NaPi-4 mRNA, several conditions must be satisfied. First, prevention of the increase in cytosolic calcium should prevent the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-depleted cells. Second, other experimental maneuvers that increase cytosolic calcium should also increase NaPi-4 mRNA. Finally, the effect of cytosolic calcium should be specific for NaPi-4 mRNA, without affecting other membrane-bound transporters. The observed increase in cytosolic calcium in Pi-restricted OK cells is in agreement with similar findings in pancreatic islet cells, synaptosomes, and polymorphonuclear cells from rats(1.Massry S.G. Hajjar S.M. Koureta P. Fadda G.Z. Smogorzewski M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F12-F18PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Levi E. Fadda G.Z. Ozbasli C. Massry S.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2182-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 3.Kierstejn M. Chervu I. Smogorzewski M. Fadda G.Z. Alexiewicz J.M. Massry S.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1484-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic in vivo Pi deprivation is associated with multiple systemic changes (e.g. decreased parathyroid hormone and increased calcitriol and insulin), which may themselves affect cell function(4.Murer H. Werner A. Reshkin S. Wuarin F. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C885-C899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Murer H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1649-1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the increase in cytosolic calcium in this study occurred in cultured cells, in isolation from systemic factors, it must reflect an intrinsic effect of Pi restriction. Moreover, the finding of increased cytosolic calcium even during partial Pi restriction (Fig. 1A) establishes the physiologic significance of this effect. The cellular mechanism whereby Pi restriction increases cytosolic calcium in OK cells remains to be established. Levi et al.(2.Levi E. Fadda G.Z. Ozbasli C. Massry S.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2182-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have reported a decrease in the activity of the Ca2+-ATPase in pancreatic islet cell membranes from Pi-restricted rats. This physiologic defect, by impairing cellular extrusion of calcium, would favor an increase in cytosolic calcium due to unopposed entry of calcium from the extracellular space. Experimental maneuvers that impede entry of calcium into the cells or that chelate calcium may prevent an increase in cytosolic calcium in Pi-restricted cells. Thus, we have observed that incubation with the calcium channel blocker verapamil prevented the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA. Verapamil has multiple effects on cellular function that are independent of calcium channel blockade. Thus, for example, multiple immune functions of lymphocytes are inhibited by both S(-)-verapamil and R(+)-verapamil, even though only the former enantiomer blocks the calcium channel(15.Weir M.R. Peppler R. Gomolka D. Handwerger B.S. Transplantation (Baltimore). 1992; 54: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, demonstrating inhibition of a particular cellular function by verapamil does not necessarily establish that cytosolic calcium mediates that function. In this study, however, the adaptations to Pi restriction were blocked only by S(-)-verapamil, and not by R(+)-verapamil. This discrepancy suggests that the increase in cytosolic calcium is in fact mediating the corresponding increases in Na/Pi cotransport activity, NaPi-4 mRNA, and NaPi-4 protein. Even in the presence of a net influx of calcium into cells, a calcium chelator prevents the anticipated increase in cytosolic calcium. We found that the calcium chelator quin-2/AM prevented the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-restricted OK cells (Fig. 5). This observation adds further weight to the hypothesis that the increase in cytosolic calcium mediates the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA. Calcium ionophores promote entry of calcium into the cell, also favoring an increase in cytosolic calcium. If the increase in cytosolic calcium mediates the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-depleted cells, then calcium ionophores should increase NaPi-4 mRNA levels even in Pi-replete cells. Indeed, we found that incubation with two different calcium ionophores, ionomycin and A23187, reproduced the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-replete OK cells (Fig. 5). Moreover, the effects of Pi restriction and the calcium ionophores on NaPi-4 mRNA were not additive, suggesting that both experimental maneuvers are mediated by a common biochemical pathway. It is possible that an increase in cytosolic calcium produces multiple nonspecific cellular changes, rather than a specific increase in certain cellular functions. The lack of change in sodium-dependent glucose transporter mRNA during Pi restriction and calcium ionophore incubation (two experimental maneuvers that increase steady-state cytosolic calcium) suggests, however, that the effects are specific for the membrane-bound Na/Pi cotransporter. The parallel increases in NaPi-4 mRNA, NaPi-4 protein, and Na/Pi cotransport activity in Pi-depleted OK cells are in agreement with our previous report(12.Saxena S. Dansby L. Allon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA mediates the increase in Na/Pi cotransport activity during chronic Pi depletion. The prevention by actinomycin D of the increase in both NaPi-4 mRNA and Na/Pi cotransport activity during Pi depletion (Fig. 4) lends weight to this conclusion. The observed increase in NaPi-4 mRNA during Pi depletion may reflect either an increase in transcription rate or an increase in mRNA stability. Our finding that actinomycin blocks the increase in NaPi-4 mRNA in Pi-restricted cells (Fig. 4) tends to support a transcriptional effect of cytosolic calcium. The recent demonstration of a direct modulation of transcription factors by calcium (8.Yang J. Tashjian A.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundstrom T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) suggests that increased cytosolic calcium may interact with a transcription factor for NaPi-4, thereby increasing NaPi-4 mRNA levels. On the basis of our experimental findings, we propose that phosphate depletion increases cytosolic calcium in renal tubular epithelial cells. The increase in cytosolic calcium modulates a transcription factor for the Na/Pi cotransporter gene. This effect, in turn, increases Na/Pi cotransporter mRNA and protein levels, ultimately up-regulating Na/Pi cotransport activity. Confirmation of this novel cellular mechanism will require a more detailed knowledge of the promoter and enhancer regions associated with the Na/Pi cotransporter DNA. We thank David G.

At 20°C, and pH 7.1, maximal stimulation (1.5-2.5-fold) was obtained with 1 μM InsP3, and the EC50 was 60 ± 5 nM. Several lines of evidence suggested that the activating site is identical with the InsP3 binding site: (i) activation and binding exhibited the same inositol phosphate specificity; (ii) addition of decavanadate, a competitive inhibitor of [3H]InsP3 binding, to the preincubation mixture, prevented the activating effect of InsP3; (iii) the concentration of InsP3 giving half-maximal activation was close to that giving half-maximal InsP3 binding. The time course of activation was found to be much slower than that of binding. While a t1/2 less than 0.4 s has been measured recently at neutral pH and 20°C for binding of 0.5 nM [3H]InsP3 (Hannaert-Merah, Z., Coquil, J.-F., Combettes, L., Claret, M., Mauger, J.-P., and Champeil, P.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29642-29649), a 20-s preincubation with 1 μM InsP3 was required to half-maximally stimulate binding. Under the present conditions, the InsP3-induced binding increase was only partially reversible. However, this effect was not blocked by antiproteases suggesting that it did not involve proteolysis. Taking advantage of the marked difference in the kinetics of InsP3 binding and InsP3-dependent activation, we performed binding experiments on a short period (3 s) to determine the effect of InsP3 pretreatment on the binding parameters. The data showed that this treatment increased the affinity of the receptor without changing the number of binding sites (control: KD = 107 nM, Bmax = 28 pmol/mg of protein; after preincubation with 1 μM InsP3: KD = 53 nM, Bmax = 32 pmol/mg of protein). The two states of the receptor bound InsP3 with a Hill coefficient close to 1 on a 3-s scale. In agreement with the effect of InsP3 pretreatment, equilibrium binding experiments performed on 10-min incubations revealed an apparent positive cooperative behavior (apparent Hill coefficient = 1.6; apparent KD = 66 nM). These results report a new regulatory process of the InsP3 receptor in cerebellum occurring independently of Ca2+ and on a relatively long time scale. Incubation of cerebellar microsomes with D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (0.01-1 μM), at 4 or 20°C in a cytosolic-like medium devoid of Ca2+ and Mg2+, followed by InsP3 removal, induced an increase in InsP3 binding determined with 1 nM [3H]InsP3.

In agreement with the effect of InsP3 pretreatment, equilibrium binding experiments performed on 10-min incubations revealed an apparent positive cooperative behavior (apparent Hill coefficient = 1.6; apparent KD = 66 nM). These results report a new regulatory process of the InsP3 receptor in cerebellum occurring independently of Ca2+ and on a relatively long time scale. The second messenger D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) ( 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3 D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate IICR InsP3-induced Ca2+ release.) mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ by activating a receptor/channel located in the endoplasmic reticulum (Taylor and Richardson, 1991; Ferris and Snyder, 1992; Berridge, 1993). This process may be crucial in the genesis of repetitive calcium spikes which characterize the cellular calcium response to many stimuli (Berridge, 1993). Several genes encoding a family of InsP3 receptors have been identified, and the molecular diversity of the receptor is amplified further by alternative splicing. In many tissues, diverse isoforms of the receptor are produced in different amounts (Südhof et al., 1991; Nakagawa et al., 1991; Ross et al., 1992; Blondel et al., 1993; De Smedt et al., 1994). In the cerebellum, most InsP3 receptor mRNAs encode type I receptor (Furuichi et al., 1989; De Smedt et al., 1994). The high concentration of type I receptor in Purkinje cells of cerebellum, has facilitated its purification, and the receptor has been proposed to be an homotetramer (Supattapone et al., 1988; Maeda et al., 1990, 1991). Analysis of its cDNA sequence has suggested overall structural organization in three basic domains: an amino-terminal InsP3 binding domain, a carboxyl-terminal Ca2+ channel domain, and a linking domain containing sites for regulatory processes. This structure has been subsequently confirmed for other isoforms (Furuichi et al., 1989; Mignery and Südhof, 1990; Miyawaki et al., 1991; Südhof et al., 1991; Maranto, 1994). Studies of InsP3 binding and InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) with permeabilized cells or diverse receptor preparations including microsomes have allowed the identification of a variety of regulatory mechanisms for the InsP3 receptor. Ca2+ is centrally involved in the control of IICR: submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ activate, whereas higher concentrations desensitize the channel (Iino, 1990; Finch et al., 1991; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; Combettes et al., 1994). In central nervous tissue, Ca2+ inhibits InsP3 binding through a Ca2+-binding protein, calmedin (Danoff et al., 1988), whereas, in peripheral tissues, high Ca2+ concentrations transform the receptor into an inactive form which displays a high affinity for InsP3 (Pietri et al., 1990; Rouxel et al., 1992; Watras et al., 1994). ATP has been shown to stimulate channel activity through specific sites on the receptor (Ferris et al., 1990; Maeda et al., 1991; Bezprozvanny et al., 1991; Combettes et al., 1994). Several protein kinases, including A, C, G, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes, phosphorylate the receptor (Ferris and Snyder, 1992; Joseph and Ryan, 1993; Komalavilas and Lincoln, 1994; Koga et al., 1994). Oxidizing sulfhydryl reagents such as thimerosal have been shown to increase the sensitivity of the Ca2+ store by increasing the affinity of the InsP3 receptor (Missiaen et al., 1991; Renard et al., 1992; Hilly et al., 1993). In addition, recent observations suggest that InsP3 exerts effects on its receptor different from the mere rapid opening of the Ca2+ channel. It has been shown that IICR activation in permeabilized hepatocytes is followed by a period of inactivity dependent on the duration of exposure to InsP3 (Hajnóczky and Thomas, 1994). Furthermore, it was also observed that preincubation with InsP3 potentiates the stimulation by thimerosal of the Ca2+ channel activity of the purified cerebellum receptor reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles (Kaplin et al., 1994). The present studies report that occupancy of InsP3 binding sites in sheep cerebellum microsomes induces a time-dependent increase in the affinity of InsP3 receptor for its ligand. In contrast with results by Hajnóczky and Thomas(1994) on permeabilized hepatocytes, this InsP3 effect was independent of Ca2+, suggesting that it represents a previously undescribed process. Sheep cerebellar microsomes were prepared as described previously (Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994). The microsomal preparation was resuspended in homogenization buffer (5 mM Hepes, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μM pepstatin A, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4 at 4°C) and then frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80°C. Membranes were thawed and diluted in an ice-cold cytosolic-like medium (MI) containing 110 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM Hepes/KOH (pH 7.1), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Where indicated, membranes were washed and resuspended in the same medium. Preincubation of membranes (0.2-1.0 mg/ml protein) with InsP3 (1 nM to 1 μM) was also conducted in MI, supplemented with other agents as indicated. In the first series of experiments, InsP3 was removed by centrifuging the preincubation mixture at 36,000 × g for 1 h and washing membranes twice with ice-cold MI. A more rapid washing procedure was used in subsequent experiments. The membrane suspension preincubated with or without InsP3 was layered onto a Whatman GF/C glass fiber filter and then washed with 10 ml of MI. The vacuum pump was adjusted to give an outflow rate of 1 ml/s, except where indicated. The binding activity of membranes was then measured directly on the filter, as described below. [3H]InsP3 binding was measured by mixing microsomes with an appropriate volume of a binding medium consisting of MI supplemented with 1 nM [3H]InsP3, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated concentrations of unlabeled InsP3. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM InsP3. Binding was performed either in a test tube or on a GF/C glass fiber filter. In the former case, the binding mixture (final volume: 0.5 ml) was incubated for 10 min at 4 or 20°C. Four hundred microliters of the mixture were transferred onto a GF/C glass fiber filter which was then rinsed with 1 ml of an ice-cold washing medium (25 mM Hepes, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.1). To measure [3H]InsP3 binding to membranes absorbed onto the GF/C filter, 0.5 ml of the binding medium was added to the filter, the vacuum pump being either off or running according to the desired contact time with [3H]InsP3. Except where indicated, the filter was shortly rinsed with 1 ml of the ice-cold washing medium. As previously reported (Rouxel et al., 1992; Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994), InsP3 dissociates very quickly from its receptor in a cytosolic-like medium at neutral pH and 20°C (t1/2 < 0.4 s). Therefore, the rinsing step was not performed with MI but with a Hepes buffer containing 250 mM sucrose and cooled to 4°C. In addition, the perfusion rate of outflow was adjusted so that the washing lasted less than 0.5 s. This procedure removed almost all [3H]InsP3 trapped in the GF/C glass fiber filter. An adsorption of [3H]InsP3 to this type of filter is possible, but was prevented by the addition of 1 mM EDTA to the binding medium. Excess fluid was removed from the filter under vacuum before transfer into a counting vial. Radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Total binding and nonspecific binding were determined at least in triplicate, and the results were expressed as means ± S.E. The competitive binding curves and the dose-response curve for InsP3-dependent binding increase were fitted according to a one-site model, using Inplot Software (GraphPAD). Kinetics of InsP3-dependent binding increase were fitted to a simple exponential behavior. [3H]InsP3 (17-21 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Nonradioactive InsP3 was obtained from Calbiochem. Decavanadate was prepared as described previously (Föhr et al., 1989). All other products were from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. When a microsomal fraction of sheep cerebellum was preincubated with 1 μM InsP3 in a cytosolic-like medium (MI) at 4°C and then extensively washed by centrifugation in the same medium, its ability to subsequently bind [3H]InsP3 at 1 nM was doubled (Table 1). As this centrifugation procedure was very time-consuming, another method was developed to remove the initially added unlabeled InsP3, this being washing the membranes with MI on a GF/C glass fiber filter. Following the washing step, [3H]InsP3 binding was directly measured on the filter by adding 0.5 ml of MI containing 1 nM [3H]InsP3. The InsP3-dependent increase in [3H]InsP3 binding measured with this filtration method was the same as that with the centrifugation method (Table 1). In initial studies, several characteristics of the effect of InsP3 pretreatment were examined at 4°C. It was found that maximal activation was achieved with 0.1-0.3 μM InsP3 and that the activating effect of InsP3 was much slower to develop than InsP3 binding. While the binding of 1 nM [3H]InsP3 to cerebellar microsomes layered on the filter reached equilibrium within 15 s, the activation due to preincubation with 1 μM InsP3 was only maximal after 1-2 min of preincubation at 4°C in MI. The activation remained unchanged for at least 2 h. In subsequent experiments, the pretreatment of cerebellar membranes with InsP3 was generally performed for 10 min. The fact that the same level of activation was measured when membranes were washed free of InsP3 by either filtration or by centrifugation, a much longer procedure, suggests slow reversibility of the activation under these conditions. Indeed, at 4°C, the activation persisted for days. When washed membranes were placed in MI at 37°C instead of being stored in this medium at 4°C, the same qualitative results were obtained; however, within 5 min, a reduction to 48% of the initial activation occurred and remained at this level for at least 40 min. The degree of reversibility was not improved by the addition of an antiprotease mixture (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM pepstatin A, 2 mM benzamidine, 1 μg/ml O-phenanthroline, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor) to the preincubation medium, suggesting that the InsP3-induced binding increase did not involve proteolysis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A crucial point in this type of experiment was to remove carefully the nonradioactive InsP3 present in the preincubation mixture, as [3H]InsP3 binding might be reduced by residual InsP3 leading to an underestimation of the InsP3-dependent activation. An experiment was therefore performed in which the volume of the washing medium was varied. When membranes were preincubated with 1 μM InsP3, the lowest subsequent binding of [3H]InsP3 was observed in the absence of washing; that is, the condition for which the highest contamination of the filter with unlabeled InsP3 was expected. Washing the filter with MI increased the binding of [3H]InsP3 to the membranes, the maximal binding being attained at about 3-5 ml of washing medium. Increasing the volume of the washing medium to 30 ml did not change [3H]InsP3 binding. When membranes were preincubated without InsP3, washing the filter with up to 30 ml of MI had no effect on [3H]InsP3 binding. These results indicate that unlabeled InsP3 carried over from the preincubation mixture could be removed from the filter easily and the InsP3 remaining after 5 ml of washing does not reduce the subsequent [3H]InsP3 binding when measured with 1 nM [3H]InsP3. An additional experiment to determine the amount of residual InsP3 after a washing with 10 ml of MI (the standard protocol) was performed. In this experiment, the preincubation mixture containing both cerebellar membranes and 1 μM unlabeled InsP3 was supplemented with 10 nM [3H]InsP3. The results indicate that a two-thousandth of the initial [3H]InsP3 remained on the filter, corresponding to 1 pmol of InsP3 (final concentration of 2 nM after addition of binding mixture on the filter). From the [3H]InsP3 displacement curve by nonradioactive InsP3, we conclude that this residual InsP3 was about 10-fold lower than the InsP3 required to significantly reduce [3H]InsP3 binding measured with 1 nM [3H]InsP3. Thus, 10 ml of MI were adequate to wash membranes. The data reported above show that InsP3 is both able to bind to cerebellar microsomes and to increase, by preincubation, its own binding. Therefore, we investigated whether these two processes involved the same binding site or two distinct types of sites on the cerebellar membranes. Firstly, we used several different inositol phosphates to compare the specificity of [3H]InsP3 binding site with that of the site responsible for the activating effect of InsP3. To do this, we examined the ability of inositol phosphates to inhibit the binding of [3H]InsP3 to cerebellar membranes by simultaneous incubation, and their ability to increase binding of [3H]InsP3 by preincubation with membranes. The results in Table 2 show that the increase in [3H]InsP3 binding after preincubation with inositol phosphates is obtained with agonists of InsP3 receptor, but by different degrees. The order of potency of these agents was the same for the two effects: Ins(1,4,5)P3 > Ins(2,4,5)P3 ≅ GroPIns(4,5)P2 > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 > Ins(1,3,4)P3. This specificity corresponds to that previously described for particulate or purified InsP3 receptor preparations from cerebellum and peripheral tissues (Nahorski and Potter, 1989; Mourey et al., 1990; Südhof et al., 1991; Maeda et al., 1991; Rouxel et al., 1992).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Secondly, as heparin is a potent inhibitor of InsP3 binding to its receptor (Taylor and Richardson, 1991), we examined whether this agent was able to block the activating effect of InsP3. Unfortunately, pre-exposure of the cerebellar membranes to heparin led to an irreversible inhibition of InsP3 binding activity. A similar effect was reported previously for microsomes from bovine adrenal cortex at 4°C in InsP3 binding assays (Guillemette et al., 1989). However, in contrast with these studies, we were unable to recover more than 30% of [3H]InsP3 binding by diluting and washing cerebellar microsomes at 37°C. Therefore, we repeated the same type of experiments with decavanadate, another agent described as a competitive antagonist of InsP3 receptor (Föhr et al., 1989; Taylor and Richardson, 1991). As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, 3 μM decavanadate inhibited InsP3 binding measured with 0.1 μM [3H]InsP3 by 91% (A) and greatly reduced the activation by 0.1 μM InsP3 (B). Cerebellar membranes preincubated with 3 μM decavanadate alone did not exhibit a modified binding activity. Thus, decavanadate was entirely removed by washing membranes with MI and was unable to mimic the activating effect of InsP3. All studies described above were performed at 4°C, the temperature most often used in InsP3 binding assays. However, it was important to know whether activation by InsP3 could also occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, we then performed a series of experiments in which membrane preincubation, membrane washing, and InsP3 binding assay were done at 20°C. This temperature has been found to be suitable for the study of IICR (Combettes et al., 1994) and InsP3 binding (Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994) in cerebellar microsomes. In this latter study, equilibrium for InsP3 binding was shown to be attained more quickly at 20°C than at 4°C. Fig. 2 exhibits the dependence of [3H]InsP3 binding on the concentration of InsP3 in the preincubation mixture at 20°C. The maximal amplitude of binding activation was obtained at about 1 μM InsP3 and was identical with that measured at 4°C. Stimulation of 82 ± 5% was determined in 21 experiments at 20°C and of 83 ± 7% at 4°C (results from Table 1). The half-maximal response was observed at 60 ± 5 nM InsP3. In order to compare further the characteristics of [3H]InsP3 binding and the activating effect of InsP3, we determined the kinetics of activation by preincubation with 1 μM InsP3 at 20°C. For technical reasons, the method of InsP3 pretreatment differed according to its duration. For the shortest times (2 and 5 s), membranes were adsorbed onto the filter and perfused with an appropriate volume of MI with or without 1 μM InsP3. The rate of outflow through the filter was adjusted to 0.5 ml/s. For 10-s to 2-min periods, membranes were also treated with InsP3 on the filter, except incubations were performed instead of perfusions. At the longer time of 5 min, preincubations were conducted within test tubes. In all cases, InsP3 pretreatment was stopped by washing the membranes with 10 ml of MI. Fig. 3 illustrates the results of these experiments. The maximal increase of [3H]InsP3 binding activity was reached within 2 min and remained unchanged up to 5 min. The experimental data points were fitted to a simple exponential with a half-time (t1/2) of 20 s. Additional experiments at 20°C showed that binding activation remained unchanged for at least a 20-min preincubation (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that the activation was also completed within 1-3 min with lower InsP3 concentrations even if the maximal extent of activation was not greater than 15%. Thus, the observed activation by InsP3 is a much slower process than InsP3 binding itself, the latter having a half-time shorter than 0.4 s under the same experimental conditions as employed here (Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994). We then examined whether the pre-exposure of microsomes to InsP3 affected the affinity or the number of binding sites for [3H]InsP3. As the determination of KD and Bmax requires an equilibrium binding experiment with increasing InsP3 concentrations, it was a prerequisite to measure the level of [3H]InsP3 binding within a sufficiently short time to avoid InsP3-dependent activation. This condition is satisfied in MI at 20°C, a medium in which equilibrium for [3H]InsP3 binding is attained in less than 2 s (Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994). Competitive binding experiments were performed by perfusing membranes adsorbed onto the filter for periods of 2-3 s with the binding medium containing 1 nM [3H]InsP3 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand (Fig. 4A). Nonlinear regression analysis for a one-site model gave a Hill coefficient close to 1 for membranes preincubated with or without 1 μM InsP3 (nH = 1.07 and 0.95, respectively). Assuming nH = 1, a KD of 107 nM was determined for control membranes and 53 nM for InsP3-pretreated membranes. Corresponding Bmax values of 28 and 32 pmol/mg of protein were calculated as suggested by Swillens(1992). Therefore, it appears that, during preincubation, InsP3 increases the affinity of the receptor without changing the number of binding sites. Scatchard plots constructed from the same data are shown in Fig. 4B. From the data reported above, we anticipated that measurement of [3H]InsP3 binding in the presence of increasing InsP3 concentrations on a time long enough to allow activation by InsP3 should express positive cooperativity. As illustrated by the squares in Fig. 5, binding values (B) measured at InsP3 concentrations, shown previously to trigger the activation process during preincubation, were higher than that determined with 1 nM [3H]InsP3 alone (B0). These results proved such positive cooperativity directly. When transformed into a direct coordinate system and fitted to the Hill equation, half-maximal binding was calculated to be 66 nM InsP3 and the apparent Hill coefficient to be 1.6 (data not shown). In 5 different experiments performed at 4 or 20°C, we measured a maximal B/B0 value of 1.31 ± 0.06. The present studies show that in sheep cerebellar microsomes the affinity for InsP3 of its receptor was markedly increased during exposure to InsP3 over a period of 2 s to 2 min. As the total number of InsP3 binding sites was not changed by this treatment, it appears that these sites were converted to a state of higher affinity. Several lines of evidence indicate that the activating effect of InsP3 resulted from an interaction of InsP3 with the same receptor. Firstly, the selectivity of the activating site was the same as that of the [3H]InsP3 binding site and that previously reported for the InsP3 receptor in cerebellum from other species and peripheral tissues (Nahorski and Potter, 1989; Mourey et al., 1990; Südhof et al., 1991; Maeda et al., 1991; Rouxel et al., 1992). Secondly, decavanadate, a competitive inhibitor of InsP3 receptor (Föhr et al., 1989; Taylor and Richardson, 1991), prevented the activation by InsP3. Thirdly, the EC50 value for activation at 20°C (60 nM) was close to the apparent KD value determined for [3H]InsP3 binding in a 10-min incubation (66 nM). Whereas the sites for activation and binding appear to be identical, the former effect developed much more slowly than the latter. We conclude from these observations that the activation process results from prolonged occupancy of the InsP3 binding site. Most of the experiments in the present work were performed with a 10-min preincubation of cerebellar microsomal membranes with nonradioactive InsP3, followed by washing and determination of [3H]InsP3 binding after a short incubation period. The resulting increase of affinity observed in these two-step experiments was confirmed in binding measurements performed after longer (10 min) incubation periods, which revealed an apparent positive cooperative behavior (Fig. 5) and hence also indicate that InsP3 stimulates its own binding. Consistent with the slow activation by preincubation with InsP3 (Fig. 3), this behavior was not observed in experiments in which this incubation was only 2-3 s at 20°C, as indicated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1 determined with untreated membranes (Fig. 4, A and B). Considered together, these characteristics of InsP3 binding to its cerebellar receptor are reminiscent of properties of a hysteretic protein for which the apparent cooperative behavior results from slow conformational transition upon binding of its ligand. Positive cooperative behavior has not been reported previously for InsP3 binding to cerebellum receptor. However, it has been proposed that upon interaction with its binding site, InsP3 elicits a large conformational change in its receptor (Mignery and Südhof, 1990). Recently, this conformational change has been suggested to alter accessibility of thimerosal to certain sulfhydryl groups (Kaplin et al., 1994). In peripheral tissues, elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ above its resting concentration (100-200 nM) increases the affinity of the InsP3 receptor for its ligand (Hilly et al., 1993; Marshall and Taylor, 1993) by reducing the dissociation rate constant (Hilly et al., 1993). When the free Ca2+ concentration reaches 0.5-1 μM, these receptors are converted into a high affinity inactive state characterized by low rates of association and dissociation of InsP3 (Pietri et al., 1990; Hilly et al., 1993; Watras et al., 1994). In contrast, the InsP3-dependent conversion of sheep cerebellum InsP3 receptor to a higher affinity state was observed in the presence of 1 mM EDTA, that is, at nanomolar free Ca2+ concentrations. In this tissue, Ca2+ inhibits InsP3 binding (Worley et al., 1987; Hannaert-Merah et al., 1994), an effect which has been proposed to be mediated by the Ca2+-binding protein, calmedin (Danoff et al., 1988). However, the InsP3 activating effect cannot be due to removal of inhibitory influence by calmedin, since 1 mM EDTA has been reported to prevent and reverse the inhibition by this protein (Worley et al., 1987; Joseph et al., 1989). Furthermore, we found that sheep cerebellar microsomes preincubated with free Ca2+ concentrations up to 100 μM and then washed with 10 ml of MI containing 1 mM EDTA did not exhibit a lower [3H]InsP3 binding as compared with membranes exposed to nanomolar Ca2+ concentrations (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the activation by InsP3 occurs independently of Ca2+. However, this does not preclude any regulatory influence of Ca2+ on this process. The ability of InsP3 to increase its own binding in microsomes washed with MI, indicates that molecules involved in this process are tightly associated with membranes. Several membrane-associated proteins have been proposed to interact with the cerebellum InsP3 receptor, including ankyrin (Joseph and Samanta, 1993; Bourguignon et al., 1993) and calmedin which, however, is not involved as discussed above. Another possibility is that the transition induced by InsP3 involves changes in interaction between the InsP3 receptor subunits. Evidence for an association between subunits of InsP3 receptors of adjacent cisternae of smooth endoplasmic reticulum has been obtained in immunocytological studies of Purkinje cells (Satoh et al., 1990; Otsu et al., 1990; Villa et al., 1991; Takei et al., 1992, 1994). Alternatively, it may be possible that the activating effect of InsP3 might involve a covalent modification of the InsP3 receptor, e.g. a change in the phosphorylation state. Cerebellum InsP3 receptor has been shown to be phosphorylated by several protein kinases (Ferris and Snyder, 1992; Koga et al., 1994). A major characteristic of the affinity increase of the cerebellum InsP3 receptor following InsP3 pretreatment is the slowness of its kinetics (t1/2 = 20 s; Fig. 3) as compared with that of the InsP3 binding (see above) and IICR (t1/2 = 0.2 s with 0.15 μM InsP3; Combettes et al.(1994)). This difference implies that the increase in InsP3 receptor affinity, resulting from InsP3 binding, occurs after Ca2+ efflux has been completed and thus affects subsequent events only. Recently, it has been reported that pre-exposure of permeabilized hepatocytes to InsP3 is followed by a time-dependent inactivation of IICR (Hajnóczky and Thomas, 1994). The time course for [3H]InsP3 binding activation in the present studies (t1/2 = 20 s, Fig. 3) is very similar to that of the InsP3-induced inactivation described by Hajnóczky and Thomas (t1/2 = 15 s). However, in contrast to our results on cerebellar microsomes, inactivation by InsP3 in permeabilized hepatocytes was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and was accelerated by increasing the Ca2+ concentration up to 1 μM. With respect to the effect of InsP3 pretreatment of cerebellar microsomes on the function of the InsP3 receptor (IICR), further studies will be required. The slow kinetics of the increase in InsP3 affinity suggests that it will be dependent on a prolonged increase in the level of InsP3 in intact cells, and that, therefore, it reflects a long-term regulation process. The same effect might also be attained with repetitive increases in the cellular level of InsP3 if the InsP3 binding activation is slowly reversible in intact cells, as suggested by the present in vitro conditions. Interestingly, such a situation might be encountered in long-term potentiation and long-term depression, two important models of synaptic plasticity, induced by tetanic and/or repetitive or prolonged stimulation of synapses (Madison et al., 1991; Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Artola and Singer, 1993). In cerebellum, long term depression is well known to occur at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses (Ito, 1989; Daniel et al., 1992; Conquet et al., 1994). Evidence has been obtained for involvement of the InsP3/Ca2+ signaling system in these processes (Kato, 1993; Kasai and Petersen, 1994). Many different cell types respond by repetitive Ca2+ spikes to sustained application of agonists acting through InsP3. Characteristically, the agonist-stimulated accumulation of InsP3 consists in a rapid peak followed by a much lower but sustained phase (Willars and Nahorski, 1995). We hypothesize that such a pattern of InsP3 accumulation may lead to an increase in the affinity of the InsP3 receptor for InsP3 and therefore facilitate the generation of Ca2+ oscillations while InsP3 level is increased only slightly. Repetitive Ca2+ spikes have been observed at basal InsP3 concentration following intracellular injection of thimerosal, a thiol alkylating agent which sensitizes the Ca2+ stores to InsP3 (Bootman et al., 1992), by increasing the affinity of the InsP3 receptor (Hilly et al., 1993). Consistent with our hypothesis, studies in intact cells have shown that InsP3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization may also be sensitized by a prior InsP3 injection or agonist activation (Parker and Miledi, 1989). In summary, the present studies show that in sheep cerebellar microsomes a prolonged exposure of InsP3 to its receptor, converts this protein to a state exhibiting higher affinity. This phenomenon indicates that, upon binding, InsP3 not only opens the Ca2+ channel (a rapid process) but also initiates a slower regulation of the protein. We thank J.
