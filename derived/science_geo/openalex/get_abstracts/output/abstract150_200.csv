https://openalex.org/W1497013446,"Kinetic parameters of the interaction of the toxic lectins abrin and ricin with human erythrocytes and HeLa cells have been measured. The binding of 125I-labeled abrin and ricin to human erythrocytes and to HeLa cells at 37 degrees was maximal around pH 7, whereas at 0 degrees the binding was similar over a broad pH range. The binding occurred at similar rates at 0 degrees and 37 degrees with rate constants in the range 0.9 to 3.0 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. The dissociation was strongly temperature-dependent with rate constants in the range 3.4 to 45 X 10(-4) s-1 at 0 degrees and 3.9 to 18 X 10(-3) s-1 at 37 degrees. The presence of unlabeled lectins as well as lactose increased the rate of dissociation. The association constants measured at equilibrium or calculated from the rate constants were between 0.64 X 10(8) M-1 and 8.2 X 10(8) M-1 for abrus lectins, and between 8.0 X 10(6) M-1 and 4.2 X 10(8) M-1 for ricinus lectins. The association constants for the toxins were lower at 37 degrees than at 0 degrees. Isolated ricin B chain appeared to bind with similar affinity as intact ricin. The number of binding sites was estimated to be 2 to 3 X 10(6) per erythrocyte and 1 to 3 X 10(7) per HeLa cell. The binding sites of HeLa cells all displayed a uniform affinity towards abrin and ricin, both at 0 degrees and at 37 degrees. The same was the case with the binding sites of erythrocytes at 0 degrees. However, the data indicated that at 20 degrees erythrocytes possessed binding sites with two different affinities. Only a fraction of the cell-bound toxin appeared to be irreversibly bound and could not be removed by washing with 0.1 M lactose. The fraction of the total amount of bound toxin which became irreversibly bound to HeLa cells was for both toxins about 2 X 10(-3)/min at 37 degrees, whereas no toxin was irreversibly bound at 0 degrees. In the case of erythrocytes no toxin became irreversibly bound, either at 0 degrees or 37 degrees, indicating that the toxins are unable to penetrate into these cells."

Covalent binding of these metabolites to liver macromolecules paralleled hepatic cellular necrosis. The metabolites formed from these and probably other monosubstituted hydrazines are reactive electrophiles."
https://openalex.org/W1988057005,"The 71,000 dalton glycoprotein (gp71) purified from Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) by affinity chromatography specifically binds to murine but not other mammalian cells in culture. Binding is prevented by specific antiserum raides to gp71 (anti-gp71). The binding assay as described in this report can detect receptors on as few as 300 murine cells, and with 1 X 10(5) cells gives significant binding with 30 sec. The results show that the purified glycoprotein retians biologic activity and can form a stable complex with specific receptors on mouse cell membranes. The assay can therefore be used to characterize the nature of the cellular receptors that are essential for leukemia virus infection. Purified gp71 binding to mouse cells is prevented if the cells are actively producing related ecotropic type C viruses, presumably because the receptors are occupied and are not available to bind exogenously applied gp71. The binding of gp71 to murine cells is enhanced by the presence of calcium ions and low pH. Binding studies performed using an excess of 125I-gp71 indicate the NIH/3T3 cells bind approximately 5.3 X 10(5) molecules of 125I-gp71 per cell."
https://openalex.org/W1581498719,"The phosphoprotein phosphatase(s) acting on muscle phosphorylase a was purified from rabbit liver by acid precipitation, high speed centrifugation, chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50, Sephadex G-75, and Sepharose-histone. Enzyme activity was recovered in the final step as two distinct peaks tentatively referred to as phosphoprotein phosphatases I and II. Each phosphatase showed a single broad band when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis; the molecular weights derived by this method were approximately 30,500 for phosphoprotein phosphatase I and 34,000 for phosphoprotein phosphatase II. The s20, w value for each enzyme was 3.40. Using this value and values for the Stokes radii, the molecular weight for each enzyme was calculated to be 34,500. Both phosphatases, in addition to catalyzing the conversion of phosphorylase a to b, also catalyzed the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase D, activated phosphorylase kinase, phosphorylated histone, phosphorylated casein, and the phosphorylated inhibitory component of troponin (TN-I). The relative activities of the phosphatases with respect to phosphorylase a, glycogen synthase D, histone, and casein remained essentially constant throughout the purification. The activities of both phosphatases with different substrates decreased in parallel when they were denatured by incubation at 55 degrees and 65 degrees. The Km values of phosphoprotein phosphatase I for phosphorylase a, histone, and casein were lower than the values obtained for phosphoprotein phosphatase II. With glycogen synthase D as substrate, each enzyme gave essentially the same Km value. Utilizing either enzyme, it was found that activity toward a given substrate was inhibited competitively by each of the alternative substrates. The results suggest that phosphoprotein phosphatases I and II are each active toward all of the substrates tested."

These agents are effective in the absence of extracellular calcium and enhance guanylate cyclase activity in tissue homogenates. Stimulation of cyclic GMP was greatest in liver, where the carcinogenic activity of nitrosamines is also most pronounced."
https://openalex.org/W1497278075,"The transmembrane potential of isolated chromaffin granules has been measured using the permeant ions [14C]methylamine and [35S]thiocyanate, as well as the fluorescent probe, 9-aminoacridine. At pH 7.0, the granule membrane had a Nernst proton potential of -45mV, inside negative. This potential was sensitive to the external pH, but was unaffected by K+,Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or other cations. The pH of zero potential was 6.25 for both methylamine and thiocyanate. Thiocyanate also had a Nernst potential of similar magnitude and sign to that of methylamine at pH 7.0, and was also sensitive to variation in external pH. Mg2+ATP was found to depolarize the granule membrane by a saturable mechanism with a K 1/2 for ATP of 40 muM. Ca2+ was only 30% as effective as Mg2+ in supporting the ATP effect. The pH optimum for this process was 6.25 and appeared to be accompanied by a marked alkalinization of the granule interior. The specificity for ATP was further tested with structural analogs of ATP and GTP. The rate of change of membrane potential in response to changes in external pH or Mg2+ATP was estimated using the fluorescent probe 9-aminoacridine. Changes came to completion in less than 1 s. This suggested that the ATP effects were not dependent on an enzymatic transformation but on an ATP-induced conformational change in the membrane. We conclude that the chromaffin granule exists in at least two proton permeability states, corresponding to the presence or absence of Mg2+ATP. These states may be related to hormone release from granules and regulation of secretion in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1591783020,"The reaction between carboxyhemoglobin and reduced microperoxidase (MP): Hb4(CO)4 + 4MP=Hb4 + 4MPCO, recently reported by us, has been further studied. By generating species Hb4(CO), Hb4(CO)2, and Hb(CO)3 in the stopped flow cuvette by the reaction of dithionite with the species of the general formula Hb4(O2)x(CO)y(x + y=4) in the presence of microperoxidase it has been possible to determine the stepwise CO dissociation rate constants l4, l3, l2, and l1. The overall CO dissociation rate constant l, which is the same in this system as l4, is not affected by 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. The activation energy of the reaction is 21,400 cal in 15-25 degrees range. The ratio deltal/deltapH is approximately 3 in 6.5 to 7.5 pH range. The kinetic data indicate that, compared to HbO2, the contribution to the cooperativity of the dissociation rate constants of carboxyhemoglobin is greatly reduced. The ligand-dependent differences in the reactions of Hb with CO, O2, and NO suggest that in the combination reactions the ligand plays an active role in the rate-limiting step."
https://openalex.org/W1491020421,"Protoporphyrinogen oxidase, an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX in yeast cells, has been found in several mammalian tissues. It has been extracted from rat liver mitochondria by sonication in the presence of salt and detergent and partially purified. The enzyme is similar in many respects to yeast protoporphyrinogen oxidase. Based on its behavior on Sephadex G-200 the molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 35,000. Catalysis by protoporphyrinogen oxidase was specific for proteoporphyrinogen IX (apparent Km of 11 muM) and proceeded maximally at pH 8.6 to 8.7. The effect of temperature on enzyme activity plotted according to Arrhenius gave a value of E of 9,100 calories per mol. Enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of high salt concentrations and temperatures above 45 degrees. Oxygen was essential for protoporphyrinogen oxidase activity and an alternative elevtron acceptor has not yet been found. No requirement for a metal or other cofactor could be demonstrated. The presence of monothiol groups was indicated; however, it is not known whether the thiol groups are involved directly in the binding of substrate to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1599734763,"The oxidation-reduction potential, E2, for the couple oxidized lipoamide dehydrogenase/2-electron reduced lipoamide dehydrogenase has been determined by measurement of equilibria of these enzyme species with lipoamide and dihydrolipoamide or with oxidized and reduced azine dyes. E2 is -0.280 V at pH 7, and deltaE2/deltapH is -0.06 V in the pH range 5.5 to 7.6. Values for E1, the oxidation-reduction potential for the couple 2-electron reduced enzyme/4-electron reduced enzyme, were obtained from measurements of the extent of dismutation of 2-electron reduced enzyme to form mixtures containing oxidized and 4-electron reduced enzyme. E1 is -0.346 V at pH 7, and deltaE1/deltapH is -0.06 V in the pH range 5.7 to 7.6. Spectra of oxidized enzyme and 4-electron reduced enzyme do not show variations with pH over this range, but the spectrum of the 2-electron reduced enzyme is pH-dependent, with the molar extinction at 530 nm changing from 3250 M-1 cm-1 at pH 8 to 2050 M-1 cm-1 at pH 5.2. The pH-dependent changes which are observed in the absorption properties of the 2-electron reduced enzyme are consistent with the disappearance of a charge transfer complex between an amino acid side chain and the oxidized flavin at the lower pH values, with the apparent pK of the side chain at pH 5. It has been suggested that the 530 nm absorbance of 2-electron reduced enzyme is due to a charge transfer complex between thiolate anion and oxidized flavin, and we propose that the thiolate anion is stabilized by interaction with a protonated base. The thermodynamic data predict that the amount of 4-electron reduced enzyme formed when the enzyme is reduced by excess NADH will be pH-dependent, with the greatest amounts seen at low pH values. These data support earlier evidence (Matthews, R.G., Wilkinson, K.D., Ballou, D,P., and Williams, C.H., Jr. (1976) in Flavins and Flavoproteins (Singer, T.P., ed) pp. 464-472; Elsevier Scientific Publishing Co., Amsterdam) that the role of NAD+ in the NADH-lipoamide reductase reaction catalyzed by lipoamide dehydrogenase is to prevent accumulation of inactive 4-electron reduced enzyme by simple reversal of the reduction of 2-electron reduced enzyme by NADH."

https://openalex.org/W2044852112,"We have studied the mechanism of the specific inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis by ppGpp in a purified system using as templates E. coli DNA and DNA from lambdad5ilv, which carries a rRNA cistron from E. coli. Ribosomal RNA synthesis, as well as its inhibition by ppGpp, are critically salt-dependent. Of a number of guanosine phosphates tested, only pppGpp (MS II) mimicked the action of ppGpp, establishing the specificity of ppGpp. The two templates gave similar results for rRNA synthesis in all experiments. By using the initiation inhibitor rifampicin, we could show that the specific inhibition of rRNA synthesis by ppGpp is due to its effect on rRNA initiation. The somewhat variable inhibition of RNA synthesis in general by ppGpp is mainly or wholly a consequence of premature chain termination. We propose that ppGpp specifically inhibits rRNA synthesis by acting on the formation of the so-called ""closed-promoter complex""."

https://openalex.org/W1552728079,"Three forms of alpha-D-mannosidase have previously been identified in rat liver, and each is localized in a different subcellular fraction: lysosomes, Golgi membranes, and cytosol. This communication reports the purification and characterization the cytosolic form. The enzyme was purified 12,000-fold in good yield to approximately 90% purity with the aid of the competitive inhibitor mannosylamine and dithioerythritol as stabilizers. The molecular weight of the enzyme is in the range of 372,000 to 490,000 depending on the method used. Since the subunit molecular weight is 110,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the enzyme is probably a tetramer. The pH optimum was shown to be between 5.5 and 5.9 (in the presence of 1 mM CoCl2) with the substrate p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside. Normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed with a Km of 0.14 mM. Mannosylamine was a competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 0.007 mM. The purified enzyme, stabilized by Co2+, Mn2+, and Fe2+ under some conditions, was unstable at low protein concentrations. Since an electrophoresed sample showed a positive periodic acid-Schiff stain, the enzyme may contain carbohydrate. The availability of purified cytosolic alpha-D-mannosidase should now make it possible to carry out substrate specificity, immunological, and structural studies which may shed light on the biological role of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1856552113,"Conformational changes of apo A-1, the principal apoprotein of human plasma high density lipoprotein, have been studied by differential scanning calorimetry and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy as a function of temperature, pH, concentration of apoprotein, and urea concentration. Calorimetry shows that apo A-1 (5 to 40 mg/ml, pH 9.2) undergoes a two-state, reversible denaturation (enthalpy = 64 +/- 8.9 kcal/mole), between 43--71 degrees (midpoint temperature, Tm = 54 degrees), associated with a rise in heat capacity (deltaCvd) of 2.4 +/- 0.5 kcal/mole/degrees C. Apo A-1 (0.2 to 0.4 mg/ml, pH 9.2) develops a negative difference spectrum between 42--70 degrees, with Tm = 53 degrees. The enthalpy (deltaH = 59 +/- 5.7 kcal/mole at Tm) and heat capacity change (2.7 +/- 0.9 kcal/mole/degrees C) in the spectroscopic experiments were not significantly different from the calorimetric values. Below pH 9 and above pH 11, the calorimetric Tm and deltaH of denaturation are decreased. In the pH range of reversible denaturation (6.5 to 11.8), delatH and Tm are linearly related, showing that the heat capacity change (ddeltaH/dT) associated with denaturation is independent of Tm. In urea solutions, the calorimetric Tm and deltaH of denaturation are decreased. At 25 degrees, apo A-1 develops a negative difference spectrum between 1.4 and 3 M urea. Fifty per cent of the spectral change occurs in 2.4 M urea, which corresponds to the urea concentration obtained by extrapolation of the calorimetric Tm to 25 degrees. In urea solution of less than 0.75 M there is hyperchromicity at 285 nm (delta epsilon = 264 in 0.75 M urea), indicating strong interaction of aromatic amino acid residues in the native molecule with the solvent. Spectrophotometric titration of apo A-1 shows that 6.6 of the 7 tyrosine groups of apo A-1 titrate at pH less than 11.9, with similar titration curves obtained in aqueous solutions and in 6 M urea. The free energy of stabilization (deltaG) of the native conformation of apo A-1 was estimated, (a) at 37 degrees, using the calorimetric deltaA and deltaCvd, and (b) at 25 degrees, by extrapolation of spectroscopic data to zero urea concentration. The values (deltaG (37 degrees) = 2.4 and deltaG (25 degrees) = 2.7 kcal/mole) are small compared to typical globular proteins, indicating that native apo A-1 has a loosely folded tertiary structure. The low values of deltaG reflect the high degree of exposure of hydrophobic areas in the native protein molecule. The loosely folded conformation of apo A-1 allows extensive binding of lipid, since this can involve both surface hydrophobic sites and hydrophobic areas exposed by a cooperative, low energy unfolding process."

https://openalex.org/W1655868583,"Anaerobic reduction of the flavoprotein adrenodoxin reductase with NADPH yields a spectrum with long wavelength absorbance, 750 nm and higher. No EPR signal is observed. This spectrum is produced by titration of oxidized adrenodoxin reductase with NADPH, or of dithionite-reduced adrenodoxin reductase with NADP+. Both titrations yield a sharp endpoint at 1 NADP(H) added per flavin. Reduction with other reductants, including dithionite, excess NADH, and catalytic NADP+ with an NADPH generating system, yields a typical fully reduced flavin spectrum, without long wavelength absorbance. The species formed on NADPH reduction appears to be a two-electron-containing complex, with a low dissociation constant, between reduced adrenodoxin reductase and NADP+, designated ARH2-NADP+. Titration of dithionite-reduced adrenodoxin reductase with NADPH also produces a distinctive spectrum, with a sharp endpoint at 1 NADPH added per reduced flavin, indicating formation of a four-electron-containing complex between reduced adrenodoxin reductase and NADPH. Titration of adrenodoxin reductase with NADH, instead of NADPH, provides a curved titration plot rather than the sharp break seen with NADPH, and permits calculation of a potential for the AR/ARH2 couple of -0.291 V, close to that of NAD(P)H (-0.316 V). Oxidized adrenodoxin reductase binds NADP+ much more weakly (Kdiss=1.4 X 10(-5) M) than does reduced adrenodoxin reductase, with a single binding site. The preferential binding of NADP+ to reduced enzyme permits prediction of a more positive oxidation-reduction potential of the flavoprotein in the presence of NADP+; a change of about + 0.1 V has been demonstrated by titration with safranine T. From this alteration in potential, a Kdiss of 1.0 X 10(-8) M for binding of NADP+ to reduced adrenodoxin reductase is calculated. It is concluded that the strong binding of NADP+ to reduced adrenodoxin reductase provides the thermodynamic driving force for formation of a fully reduced flavoprotein form under conditions wherein incomplete reduction would otherwise be expected. Stopped flow studies demonstrate that reduction of adrenodoxin reductase by equimolar NADPH to form the ARH2-NADP+ complex is first order (k=28 s-1). When a large excess of NADPH is used, a second apparently first order process is observed (k=4.25 s-1), which is interpreted as replacement of NADPH for NADP+ in the ARH2-NADP+ complex. Comparison of these rate constants to catalytic flavin turnover numbers for reduction of various oxidants by NADPH, suggests an ordered sequential mechanism in which reduction of oxidant is accomplished by the ARH2-NADP+ complex, followed by dissociation of NADP+. The absolute dependence of NADPH-cytochrome c reduction on both adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin is confirmed..."

https://openalex.org/W1564079402,"A23187 transports calcium rapidly into rat erythrocytes, apparently by an electroneutral exchange for intracellular magnesium and protons. When red cells are incubated in the absence of any added divalent cations, A23187 transports internal magnesium out of the cells, in exchange for extracellular protons. Magnesium uptake into erythrocytes is produced by A23187, providing the extracellular concentration of this cation exceeds intracellular levels, and the ionophore also transports strontium, but not barium, into red cells. A23187 produces a rapid and extensive loss of intracellular potassium from erythrocytes during uptake of calcium or strontium, but not magnesium. When red cells are incubated in the absence of any exogenous divalent cations, A23187 still produces a potassium efflux and this is inhibited completely by small amounts of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid and restored by the addition of calcium in excess of the chelator. Although EDTA enhances the extent of magnesium release from erythrocytes incubated with A23187, it prevents the potassium efflux. Dipyridamole and 4-acetamid-4'-isothiocyano-stilbene-2,5'-disulfonic acid, which decrease chloride premeability of erythrocytes, inhibit the A23187-induced potassium loss from red cells. Rutamycin, peliomycin, venturicidin, and A23668B also inhibit potassium efflux from intact cells incubated with A23187, but this effect is not correlated with their abilities to inhibit various ATPases in red cell membrane preparations. It is concluded that A23187 does not transport potassium directly across the erythrocyte plasma membrane, but permits small amounts of endogenous calcium to interact with some membrane component to enhance potassium permeability of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W1548564541,"Reduction of the active center disulfide bond in the flavoprotein pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase generates two sulfur moieties which are chemically inequivalent in the 2-electron reduced form of the enzyme. Thus 1 cysteine residue is at least 13-fold more reactive than its partner toward iodoacetamide at pH 7.6. This selectivity was demonstrated by reaction of the 2-electron reduced enzyme with a low concentration of iodo[1-14C]acetamide under anaerobic conditions. The formation of a monolabeled derivative is accompanied by the reappearance of a spectrum of oxidized bound flavin, clearly different from that of the native enzyme. Alkylation of the remaining cysteine residues with iodo[12C]acetamide enabled the isolation of a tryptic version of the active center disulfide peptide. A single chymotryptic cleavage between the 2 alkylated cysteine residues generated a cationic and an anionic fragment containing 7% and 93% of the radioactivity of the purified tryptic peptide, respectively. The monolabeled derivative is catalytically inactive toward reduced or oxidized lipoamide, but is approximately 2-fold better as a transhydrogenase than the native protein using NADH and acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide as substrates. Anaerobic titration with NADH leads to reduction of the flavin with concomitant formation of long wavelength absorption of low intensity. No intermediate reduced states were detected in this titration analogous to the red 2-electron form observed with the native enzyme. Similarly, intermediates during reduction of the enzyme by 1 eq of dithionite have not been detected."

The isolation scheme involved an acid precipitation of tissue extract, DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200 chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The end product represented about a 1000-fold purification and about a 10% recovery. The purified enzyme was the major isoenzyme, which represented 60% of cathepsin D present in porcine spleen. Two minor isoenzymes of cathepsin D were present in small amounts. The purified enzyme resembled porcine pepsin in molecular weight (35,000), amino acid composition, and inactivation by specific pepsin inactivators. The pH activity curve of the purified enzyme showed two optima near pH 3 and 4. The relative activities at these optimal pH values were affected by salt concentration. Experimental evidence indicated that the two-optima phenomenon is a property of a single enzyme species."
https://openalex.org/W1586536230,"Abstract Some physical, catalytic, and regulatory properties of ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: alpha-ketoisovalerate hydroxymethyltranferase) from Escherichia coli are described. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ketopantoate (Reaction 1), an essential precursor of pantothenic acid. (1) HC(CH3)2COCOO- + 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate f in equilibrium r HOCH2C(CH3)2COCOO- + tetrahydrofolate It has a molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium of 255,000, a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 11 S, a partial specific volume of 0.74 ml/g, an isoelectric point of 4.4, and an absorbance, (see article), of 0.85. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and amino acid analyses give a subunit molecular weight of 27,000 and 25,700, respectively; both procedures indicate the presence of 10 identical subunits. The NH2-terminal sequence is Met-Tyr---. The enzyme is stable and active over a broad pH range, with an optimum from 7.0 to 7.6. It requires Mg2+ for activity; Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+ are progressively less active. The enzyme is not inactivated by borohydride reduction in the presence of excess substrates, i.e. it is a Class II aldolase. Reaction 1f is partially inhibited by concentrations of formaldehyde (0.8 mM) and tetrahydrofolate (0.38 mM) below or near the Km values, apparent Km values are 0.18, 1.1 and 5.9 mM for tetrahydrofolate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, and formaldehyde, respectively. For Reaction 1r, apparent Km values are 0.16 and 0.18 mM, respectively, for ketopantoate and tetrahydrofolate, and the saturation curves for both substrates show positive cooperativity. Forward and reverse reactions occur at similar maximum velocities (Vmax approximately equal to 8 mumol of ketopantoate formed or decomposed per min per mg of enzyme at 37 degrees). Only 1-tetrahydrofolate is active in Reaction 1; d-tetrahydrofolate, folate, and methotrexate were neither active nor inhibitory. However, 1-tetrahydrofolate was effectively replaced with conjugates containing 1 to 6 additional glutamate residues; of these, tetrahydropterolpenta-, tetra-, and triglutamate were effective at lower concentrations than tetrahydrofolate itself; they were also the predominant conjugates of tetrahydrofolate present in E. coli. Alpha-Ketobutyrate, alpha-ketovalerate, and alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate replaced alpha-ketoisovalerate as substrates; pyruvate was inactive as a substrate, but like isovalerate, 3-methyl-2-butanone and D- or L-valine, inhibited Reaction 1. the transferase has regulatory properties expected of an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in a biosynthetic pathway. Pantoate (greater than or equal to 500 muM) and coenzyme A (above 1 mM) all inhibit; the Vmax is decreased, Km is increased, and the cooperativity for substrate (ketopantoate) is enhanced. Catalytic activity of the transferase is thus regulated by the products of the reaction path of which it is one component; transferase synthesis is not repressed by growth in the presence of pantothenate."
https://openalex.org/W1915957948,"Phosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate synthase (mutase) can both be phosphorylated by either glycerate-1,3-P2 or glycerate-2,3-P2 to form phosphohistidine enzymes. The present study uses a rapid quench procedure to determine if, for each enzyme, the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme and phosphate transfer from the enzyme can occur at rates consistent with the overall reactions. With bisphosphoglycerate synthase from horse red blood cells (glycerate-1,3-P2 leads to glycerate-2,3-P2) at pH 7.5, 25 degrees, phosphorylation of the enzyme appears rate-limiting, k = 13.5 s-1, compared with kcat = 12.5 s-1 for the overall synthase rate. Phosphoryl transfer from the enzyme to phosphoglycerate occurs at 38 s-1 at 4 degrees and was too fast to measure at 25 degrees. With chicken muscle phosphoglycerate mutase the half-times were too short to measure under optimal conditions. The rate of enzyme phosphorylation by glycerate-2,3-P2 at pH 5.5, 4 degrees, could account for the overall reaction rate of 170 s-1. The rate of phosphoryl transfer from the enzyme to glycerate-3-P was too rapid to measure under the same conditions. It is concluded that the phosphorylated enzymes have kinetic properties consistent with their participation as intermediates in the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1573434238,"The effect of temperature on the binding of thyroxine and triiodothyronine to thyroxine-binding globulin has been studied by equilibrium dialysis. Inclusion of ovalbumin in the dialysis mixture stabilized thyroxine-binding globulin against losses in binding activity which had been found to occur during equilibrium dialysis. Ovalbumin by itself bound the thyroid hormones very weakly and its binding could be neglected when analyzing the experimental results. At pH 7.4 and 37 degrees in 0.06 M potassium phosphate/0.7 mM EDTA buffer, thyroxine was bound to thyroxine-binding globulin at a single binding site with apparent association constants: at 5 degrees, K = 4.73 +/- 0.38 X 10(10) M-1; at 25 degrees, K = 1.55 +/- 0.17 X 10(10) M-1; and at 37 degrees, K = 9.08 +/- 0.62 X 10(9) M-1. Scatchard plots of the binding data for triiodothyronine indicated that the binding of this compound to thyroxine-binding globulin was more complex than that found for thyroxine. The data for triiodothyronine binding could be fitted by asuming the existence of two different classes of binding sites. At 5 degrees and pH 7.4 nonlinear regression analysis of the data yielded the values n1 = 1.04 +/- 0.10, K1 = 3.35 +/- 0.63 X 10(9) M-1 and n2 = 1.40 +/- 0.08, K2 = 0.69 +/- 0.20 X 10(8) M-1. At 25 degrees, the values for the binding constants were n1 = 1.04 +/- 0.38, K1 = 6.5 +/- 2.8 X 10(8) M-1 and n2 = 0.77 +/- 0.22, K2 = 0.43 +/- 0.62 X 10(8) M-1. At 37 degrees where less curvature was observed, the estimated binding constants were n1 = 1.02 +/- 0.06, K1 = 4.32 +/- 0.59 X 10(8) M-1 and n2K2 = 0.056 +/- 0.012 X 10(8) M-1. When n1 was fixed at 1, the resulting values obtained for the other three binding constants were at 25 degrees, K1 = 6.12 +/- 0.35 X 10(8) M-1, n2 = 0.72 +/- 0.18, K2 = 0.73 +/- 0.36 X 10(8) M-1; and at 37 degrees K1 = 3.80 +/- 0.22 X 10(8) M-1, n2 = 0.44 +/- 0.22, and K2 = 0.43 +/- 0.38 X 10(8) M-1. The thermodynamic values for thyroxine binding to thyroxine-binding globulin at 37 degrees and pH 7.4 were deltaG0 = -14.1 kcal/mole, deltaH0 = -8.96 kcal/mole, and deltaS0 = +16.7 cal degree-1 mole-1. For triiodothyronine at 37 degrees, the thermodynamic values for binding at the primary binding site were deltaG0 = -12.3 kcal/mole, deltaH0 = -11.9 kcal/mole, and deltaS0 = +1.4 cal degree-1 mole-1. Measurement of the pH dependence of binding indicated that both thyroxine and triiodothyronine were bound maximally in the region of physiological pH, pH 6.8 to 7.7."

After removal of the detergent, the enzyme remained in solution in the presence of 20% glycerol. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was about 12 mumol of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) formed - min-1 - mg of protein-1 at 30 degrees, an activity about 4600 times that of a soluble guanylate cyclase purified recently from Escherichia coli (Macchia V., Varrone, S., Weissbach, H., Miller, D.L., and Pastan, I. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 6214-6217). The cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity was negligible and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) phosphodiesterase was not detectable in the purified preparation. Cyclic AMP formation from ATP occurred at a rate of 0.002% of that of guanylate cyclase. In the absence of phosphodiesterase or guanosine triphosphatase inhibitors, 100% of the added GTP was converted to cyclic GMP. The purified enzyme required Mn2+ for maximum activity, the relative rates in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ being less than 0.6% of the rates with Mn2+. The purified enzyme displayed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to MnGTP (apparent Km is approximately equal to 170 muM) in contrast to the positively cooperative kinetic behavior displayed by the unpurified, detergent-dispersed, or particulate guanylate cyclase. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was approximately 182,000 as estimated on Bio-Gel A-0.5m columns equilibrated in the presence or absence of 0.1 M NaCl. The unpurified, detergent-dispersed enzyme also migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 182,000 on columns equilibrated with 0.5% Lubrol WX and 0.1 M NaCl, but it migrated as a large aggregate (molecular weight is greater than 5 X 10(5)) on columns equilibrated in the absence of either the detergent of NaCl. After gel filtration, the unpurified, dispersed enzyme still yielded positive cooperative kinetic patterns as a function of MnGTP. Na dodecyl-SO4 gel electrophoresis of the enzyme after the DEAE-Sephadex or the gel filtration steps resulted in two major protein bands with estimated molecular weights of 118,000 and 75,000. Whether or not these protein bands represent the subunit molecular weights of guanylate cyclase is unknown at present."
https://openalex.org/W1490300323,"The progesterone-induced purple phosphatase isolated from the uterine flushings of pigs is activated by a variety of reagents that cleave disulfide bonds, including 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol, L-ascorbate, L-cysteine, sulfite, and cyanide. It is inhibited by various mercurials, iodoacetamide, O-iodosobenzoate, and hydrogen peroxide. Thiols increase the specific phosphatase activity from 25 to about 300 units per mg of enzyme. This activation is accompanied by a shift in the extinction maximum to higher energy to yield a protein with a pink coloration. Following maximum activation there is a gradual decrease in enzyme activity and protein color which is accompanied by loss of ferrous iron from the protein. Sodium dithionite at 10 mM or higher causes an immediate inhibition of phosphatase activity and bleaching of color, and can be used to prepare the iron-free apoprotein. The latter can be partially reactivated by Fe3+ salts but not by Fe2+. The Fe3+ restores the pink form of the enzyme with a specific activity of about 200 units/mg of protein. Cu2+ also causes some reactivation, but other metal ions were ineffective. ESR studies showed that the pink form of phosphatase contains approximately 1 atom of high spin ferric iron per molecule. It is concluded that the phosphatase requires a free thiol and Fe3+ for activity. Reduction of the iron leads to complete loss of both color and enzyme activity. The color change from purple to pink represents disulfide reduction and is not due to reduction of iron."
https://openalex.org/W1810864219,"Centrifugation of homogenates of bovine retinas to isopycnic equilibrium in sucrose density gradients yielded three partially overlapping bands of particles which were, in the order of increasing density: (a) photoreceptor cell (rod) outer segments; (b) plasma membranes, lysosomes, and large fragments of endoplasmic reticulum; and (c) mitochondria. The only enzyme activity investigated which had a peak coinciding only with outer segment fractions was guanylate cyclase. Enzyme activities with peaks in both the outer segment and denser fractions included 5'-nucleotidase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Enzyme activities with peaks only in the denser fractions included sodium and potassium ion-activated ATPase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase), adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, beta-glucosidase, beta-galactosidase, and succinate-dependent cytochrome c reductase. These results suggest that some of the activities once thought to be present in rod outer segments are actually present in particles from elsewhere in the retina which contaminate rod outer segment preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1486423971,"An endo-beta-galactosidase acting on blood group A and B substances was found in the culture fluid of Diplococcus pneumoniae. The enzyme was purified 1000-fold, and its properties were studied in detail. The enzyme preparation, thus obtained, was practically free from various exoglycosidases, endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and proteases. The enzyme releases trisaccharides from blood group A and B active mucins purified from ovarian cyst fluid. The structures of the trisaccharides liberated from A and B active mucins were elucidated to be GalNAcalpha1 leads to 3(Fucalpha1 leads to 2)Gal and Galalpha1 leads to 3(Fucalpha1 leads to 2)Gal, respectively. The enzyme also hydrolyzes blood group A and B active oligosaccharides composed of type 2 chains, yielding the same products as in the case of ovarian cyst blood group substances. An H active mucin from ovarian cyst fluid, H active oligosaccharides, and A and B active oligosaccharides with type 1 chains were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Consequently, the enzyme catalyzes the following reaction, resulting in the degradation of blood type A and B determinants. (see article)."
https://openalex.org/W1530081524,"Phosphatidylglycerol conversion to bis(monoacylglyceryl)phosphate by rat liver homogenate was studied and maximum rates of synthesis were observed at pH 4.4. The distribution of bis(monoacylglyceryl)P synthetase in rat liver subcellular fractions was determined, and evidence is presented establishing the lysosomes as the site of bis(monoacylglyceryl)P synthesis. In addition to phosphatidylglycerol, 1-acyl- and 2-acyllysophosphatidylglycerol also served as precursors for bis(monoacylglyceryl)P with lysosomes as an enzyme source. Bis(monoacylglyceryl)P synthesis did not require high energy intermediates or cofactors. The possibility that a lysosomal phospholipase A with acyl transferase activity catalyzes the formation of bis(monoacylglyceryl)P was investigated. Heat stability and inhibitor studies suggested that this is probably not the case. Lysosomes were shown to be unable to synthesize phosphatidylglycerol, and lipid analyses showed that lysosomes do not contain phosphatidylglycerol or lysophosphatidylglycerol. Bis(monoacylglyceryl)P synthesis in the cell may require the interaction of lysosomes with a phosphatidylglycerol-containing membrane."

The kinetic parameters were re-evaluated in a system with carefully purified reagents (water and other chemicals) and in the presence of EDTA. The rate constant for the oxidation of the enzyme-bound NADH by O2- is calculated from the observed pseudo-first order disappearance of NADH and the chain length (molecules of NADH oxidized per O2- anion generated in the pulse). It is (1.0 +/- 0.2) X 10(5) M-1 S-1, consistent within a 13-fold variation in lactate dehydrogenase. NADH complex concentration and with varying chain length up to 6.1. Based on experiments with varying pH values from 4.5 to 9.0, the rate constant for oxidation of enzyme-bound NADH by HO2 is estimated to be 2.0 X 10(6) M-1 S-1."
https://openalex.org/W2007930149,"Chromosome-size yeast DNA molecules with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 3–4 x 108 were isolated from sucrose gradients after sedimentation of lysed yeast spheroplasts. Resedimentation showed that the molecules were isolated without introducing appreciable single-strand or double-strand breaks. The presence of crosslinks in these molecules was suggested by the observation that the apparent Mn in alkali was greater than expected for separated single strands. Since cross-linked molecules would have strands which fail to separate upon denaturation, this was tested more directly. Neutralization of alkaline denaturing conditions resulted in up to 70% of the intact molecules rapidly reforming duplex structures, as shown by equillibrium banding in CsCl. Experiments with larger E. coli DNA molecules (Mn = 5.2 x 108) indicated that the conditions used were sufficient to denature completely molecules of this size. Results of enzyme treatments suggest that the cross-links are not RNA or protein. Experiments with density-labeled yeast DNA molecules showed that the rapid reformation of duplex DNA is not the consequence either of a bimolecular reaction between separated DNA strands or of intrastrand renaturation. The data indicate that when the yeast DNA molecules are completely denatured, the strands fail to separate. Hence they must be cross-linked. Experiments with sheared DNA show that there are a small number of crosslinks, one to four, per molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2036716325,The effect of repetitive action potentials in the postsynaptic axon on the release of synaptic transmitter from the presynaptic terminal was investigated at the squid giant synapse. Repetitive antidromic stimulation of the postsynaptic axon resulted in a reduction in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The reduction in transmitter release was accompanied by a decrease in the presynaptic spike after-hyperpolarization (AH). Increasing the concentration of extracellular potassium ions also reduced the EPSP and decreased the amplitude of the presynaptic spike AH. The reduction in transmitter release resulting from repetitive postsynaptic impulses is attributed to the accumulation of extracellular potassium ions. It is proposed that the accumulation of extracellular potassium ions resulting from repetitive postsynaptic activity may modulate synaptic transmission and function as an integrative mechanism in the nervous system.
https://openalex.org/W1672761559,"The effects of sodium azide on guanylate cyclase activity of homogenates of rat renal cortex and on the guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) content of cortical slices were examined and compared to those of carbamylcholine and NaF. In complete Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mM theophylline, tissue cGMP content was increased 5- to 6-fold by 0.05 mM carbamylcholine or 10 mM NaN3, and 3-fold by 10 mM NaF. Increases in cGMP were maximal in response to these concentrations of the agonists and occurred within 2 min. Exclusion of Ca2+ from the incubation media reduced basal cGMP by 50% in 20 min and abolished responses to carbamylcholine and NaF, while exclusion of Mg2+ was without effect. Analogous reductions in cGMP were observed in complete buffer containing 1 mM tetracaine, an agent which blocks movement of Ca2+ across and binding to biologic membranes. By contrast, exclusion of Ca2+ or addition of tetracaine did not alter relative cGMP responses to NaN3 (6-fold increase over basal), although levels were reduced in slices exposed to these buffers for 20 min. When slices were incubated without Ca2+ or with tetracaine for only 2 min prior to addition of agonists, basal cGMP did not decline. Under these conditions, both absolute and relative increases in cGMP in response to NaN3 were comparable to those of slices incubated throughout in complete buffer, while carbamylcholine and NaF effects on cGMP were abolished. NaN3 increased guanylate cyclase activity of whole homogenates (10- to 20-fold), and of the 100,000 X g soluble (20-fold) and particulate (4-fold) fractions of cortex. Prior incubation of slices with NaN3 in the presence or absence of Ca2+ or with Ca2+ plus tetracaine also markedly enhanced enzyme activity in homogenates and subcellular fractions subsequently prepared from these slices. In the presence of 3 mM excess MnCl2, NaN3 raised the apparent Km for MnGTP of soluble guanylate cyclase from 0.11 mM to 0.20 mM, and reduced enzyme dependence on Mn2+. Thus, when Mg2+ was employed as the sole divalent cation in the enzyme reaction mixture basal and NaN3-responsive activities were 7% and 30% of those seen with optimal concentrations of Mn2+, respectively. Under a variety of assay conditions where responses to NaN3 were readily detectable, alterations in guanylate cyclase activities could not be demonstrated in response to carbamylcholine or NaF. By contrast Ca2+ increased the guanylate cyclase activity 6- to 7-fold over basal under conditions of reduced Mn2+ (0.75 mM Mn2+/1 mM GTP). This latter effect of Ca2+ was shared by Mg2+ and not blocked by tetracaine. Carbamylcholine, NaF, Ca2+, and NaN3 all failed to alter cGMP phosphodiesterase activity in cortex. Thus, while carbamylcholine and NaF enhance renal cortical cGMP accumulation through actions which are dependent upon the presence of extracellular Ca2+, NaN3 stimulates cGMP generation in this tissue through an apparently distinct Ca2+-independent mechanism."

Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoretic tests show that rat liver GS and HTC cell GS are immunologically similar but not identical. Immunotitrations of HTC cell extracts demonstrate that in cells incubated in high concentrations (5 mM) of glutamine, a cross-reacting form of GS with a decreased enzyme-specific activity accumulates. On prolonged incubation of cells in high glutamine, there is net degradation of GS to form immunologically inactive products. Radio-immunoprecipitation experiments show that glutamine acts by accelerating the degradation of preformed GS."
https://openalex.org/W1631998852,"The kinetics of sheep kidney gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was studied using a novel substrate L-alpha-methyl-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-aminobutyrate. When the substrate was incubated with the enzyme in the presence of an amino acid or peptide acceptor, the corresponding L-alpha-methyl-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of the acceptors were formed. In the absence of acceptor only hydrolysis occurred, and no transpeptidation products were detected. The presence of the methyl group on the alpha-carbon apparently prevents enzymatic transfer of the L-alpha-methyl-gamma-glutamyl residue to the amino group of the substrate itself (autotranspeptidation). When the enzyme was incubated with conventional substrates, such as glutathione or gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide and an amino acid acceptor, hydrolysis, autotranspeptidation, and transpeptidation to the acceptor occurred concurrently. Initial velocity measurements in which the concentration of L-alpha-methyl-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-aminobutyrate was varied at several fixed acceptor concentrations, and either the release of alpha-aminobutyrate or the formation of the transpeptidation products was determined, yielded results which are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism modified by a hydrolytic shunt. A scheme of such a mechanism is presented. This mechanism predicts the formation of an alpha-methyl-gamma-glutamyl-enzyme intermediate, which can react with an amino acid to form the transpeptidation product; or in the absence of, or in the presence of low concentrations of amino acids, can react with water to form the hydrolytic products. Kinetic derivations for the reaction of the enzyme with the conventional substrate gamma-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide predict either linear or nonlinear double-reciprocal plots, depending on the prevalence of the hydrolytic, autotranspeptidation, or transpeptidation reactions. The results of kinetic experiments confirmed these predictions."

https://openalex.org/W1554226963,"We have used a stopped flow rapid reaction pH apparatus to investigate the carbamate equilibrium in glycylglycine solutions and in three biological tissues, human plasma, sheep muscle, and sheep brain, as well as to investigate the kinetics of carbamate formation in glyclyglycine solution and in human plasma. The rapid reaction apparatus was equipped with a pH sensitive glass electrode in order to follow the time course of pH from 0.005 to 100 s after rapid mixing of a solution of amine or protein and CO2. Two phases of the pH curve were observed: a fast phase representing carbamate formation, and a slow phase due to the hydration of CO2 which was uncatalyzed since a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor was added to the biological solutions. From the time course of pH change during the fast phase K2, the R-NH2 ionization constant, and Kc, the carbamate equilibrium constant as well as the velocity constant for the formation of carbamate, ka could be calculated from data at different pH and pCO2. The carbamate formed in glycylglycine solutions over a wide range of pH and pCO2 was found consistent with the theory of carbamate formation and with published data. At ionic strength 0.16 and 37 degrees pK is 7.67. pKc 4.58. The heat of the carbamate reaction (deltaH) was calculated to be -3.2 kcal/mol between 20 degrees and 37 degrees. Kt of glycylglycine depends quantitatively on ionic strength as predicted by the Debye-Huckel theory. With ionic strength 0.16 ku was found to be 2,500 M1 S1 at 37 degrees. The activation energy of carbamate formation is 6.7 kcal/mol. Carbamate measurements in human plasma at pCO2 from 38 to 359 Torr. pH from 6.9 to 8.3, temperature 37 degrees, and ionic strength 0.15 provided evidence that two kinds of amino groups participate in carbamate formation. From the equilibrium constants computed for the two species they could be identified as alpha- and epsilon-amino groups. On the basis of a protein molecular weight of 69.000. 0.6 alpha-amino groups/molecule with pKz=7.0 and pKc=4.2, and 5.9 epsilon-amino groups/molecule with pKz=9.0 and pKc=4.3 contribute to carbamate formation. The velocity constant ka was estimated to be 4,950 M1 S1 for the alpha-amino groups and 13,800 M1 S1 for the epsilon-amino groups. Under physiological conditions (pCO2=40 Torr. pH=7.4). The concentration of carbamate in plasma is 0.6 mM and the half-time of carbamate formation is 0.05 s. In extracts prepared from sheep brain at 37 degrees pH=7 and pCO2=35 Torr. the carbamate formation was estimated to be 0.8 mM. With pCO2=70 Torr and the same pH and temperature the carbamate concentration in muscle approximates 0.3 mM and increases to 7 mM as pH rises to 8. It is concluded that, as in plasma, a considerable number of epsilon-amino groups appear to be available for carbamate formation in these tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1557487000,"The binding of cholest-5-ene-3beta,20alpha-diol (20alpha-hydroxycholesterol), 11-deoxycorticosterone, and aminoglutethimide to cytochrome P-450 in bovine adrenal mitochondria was measured by changes in optical spectra at room temperature and by EPR spectra at 14 K. The two methods provided nearly identical quantitation of these interactions with cytochrome P-450. Two distinct high spin forms of cytochrome P-450 were revealed by EPR spectra. The predominant high spin species (g = 8.2) was decreased by addition of 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol and elevated pH but was increased by addition of cholesterol. The minor high spin species (g = 8.1) was incrreased by addition of deoxycorticosterone but decreased by low concentrations of metyrapone. The two forms were evidently not in equilibrium and have been assigned to distinct forms of cytochrome P-450 involved in, respectively, cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450scc) and steroid 11beta hydroxylation (P-450(11)beta). The high spin states are derived from complexes of these P-450 cytochromes with endogenous substrates, which are, respectively, cholesterol and deoxycorticoids. A high to low spin transition was observed when these complexes were turned over by initiating hydroxylation with malate. The contributions of cytochromes P-450(11)beta and P-450scc to the low spin spectrum were also resolved by similar means. At least 20% of P-450scc is in the low spin state while about 90% of P-450(11)beta is low spin in isolated beef adrenal mitochondria. Low spin complexes of cytochrome P-450scc with 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol and 3beta-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one (pregnenolone) gave distinct EPR spectra. Aminoglutethimide interacted with the total cytochrome P-450 content of the bovine adrenal mitochondria forming low spin complexes. Both optical and EPR data indicated binding to two forms of cytochrome P-450. These results suggest a detailed correlation between the spin state and absorbance changes seen at room temperature, illustrate that EPR allows the distinction of two principal forms of P-450, and suggest that there is no appreciable change in the spin state of either cytochrome between 14 K and 300 K."

https://openalex.org/W1573801233,"DeazaFMN-containing glycolate oxidase has been prepared and shown to catalyze the stereospecific transfer of the alpha-hydrogen from substrate to enzyme-bound deazaFMN. The reaction of sulfite, cyanide, and hydroxylamine with several deazaflavin-containing enzymes (glycolate oxidase, D-amino acid oxidase, glucose oxidase, N-methylglutamate synthetase) and free deazaFMN has been examined. All the deazaflavin systems tested form reversible 1:1 complexes with sulfite and cyanide. The pH dependence of the reaction of free deazaFMN with cyanide indicates that cyanide anion is the reacting nucleophile. Hydroxylamine complexes are formed with deazaFMN glycolate oxidase and deazaFAD glucose oxidase. The effectiveness of the various nucleophilic reagents in complex formation decreases in the following order: sulfite greater than cyanide greater than hydroxylamine. The relative stability observed for the sulfite and cyanide complexes formed with various deazaflavin systems (glycolate oxidase greater than D-amino acid oxidase greater than free deazaFMN) follows the same trend observed for the stability of the sulfite complexes formed with the corresponding flavin system. A correlation is also observed between the reduction potential (E'o) of the deazaflavin system (glycolate oxidase (- 170 mV) greater than D-amino acid oxidase (-240 mV) greater than free deazaFMN (-178 mV) and the stability of the deazaflavin-nucleophile complexes. The following evidence indicates that deazaflavin systems are generally more susceptible toward nucleophilic attack than corresponding flavin system: (a) with the exception of glucose oxidase, the dissociation constants for the deazaflavin-sulfite complexes are at least 1 order of magnitude less than the corresponding flavin sulfite complexes; (b) the least reactive nucleophile, hydroxylamine, does not form a complex with any of the flavin systems. In the case of cyanide, a complex is formed only with native glycolate oxidase, which is the flavin-containing system most susceptible to attack by the more reactive sulfite. Formation of the various (deaza)flavin-nucleophile complexes is characterized by a bleaching of the longer wavelength absorption band of the chromophore and increases in absorption below the isosbestic point of the reaction in the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. These results are consistent with the formation of covalent adducts via attack of the various nucleophiles at position 5 of (deaza)flavin. The reaction with cyanide provides the first example of a reversible addition of carbanion to enzyme-bound (deaza)flavin."

The purification procedure involves ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Sephadex G-100 filtration and chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite. The final enzyme preparation gives essentially a single band on disc gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme liberates the beta-D-mannopyranosyl unit from various natural substrates such as the core glycopeptide, Man(GlcNAc)2-Asn isolated from ovalbumin, from Taka-amylase A, and from human alpha1-acid glycoprotein.

https://openalex.org/W1589380177,"Investigation of some pH-dependent properties of human erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase B indicate that the active site is influenced by at least two charged groups. The properties studied include the pH dependence of inhibition of native, monocarboxamidomethyl, and monocarboxymethyl enzymes by iodide ion and the pH dependence of the visible spectra of the cobalt derivatives of these enzymes. One ionizing group has a pKa of about 7.3 in the native enzyme, 8.2 in the carboxyamidomethyl enzyme, and 9.0 in the carboxymethyl enzyme. It has a major influence on activity and anion inhibition, and on the visible spectra of the cobalt enzymes. A second group has a pKa of about 6.1 in native and modified enzymes. When zinc is at the active site, the secondary group in its acidic form decreases the Ki for I-. With the carboxyamidomethyl and carboxymethyl enzymes, the Ki decreases by about an order of magnitude. However, if cobalt is substituted for zinc in the modified enzymes, this group does not influence the Ki for I- and the binding of I- does not influence the pKa of the spectral transitions caused by ionization of this secondary group. In the case of nonalkylated Co2+-enzyme, another ionizing group with a pK of about 6.2 prevents the binging of I- at low pH. These results show that the active site is altered when cobalt is substituted for zinc in carbonic anhydrase B."
https://openalex.org/W2076413982,"The transsynaptic induction of tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (TH) in rat adrenal medulla is preceded by an early increase in the ratio of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate, an activation of cytosol cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and a subsequent translocation of protein kinase catalytic subunits from cytosol to subcellular particles. As a result of this translocation, nuclear protein kinase activity increases during the induction of TH. Transection of splanchnic nerve reverts these events and prevents the induction of TH. Thus, adrenal medulla activation and translocation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase may act as a long-range messenger for the genetic regulation of TH synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560004319,"The method of pulse radiolysis was used to generate reagents in situ in times (500 ns to 1.5 mus) short compared with the rates of the observed biochemical processes. This instant mixing technique is compared with rapid stopped flow measurements (limited in rates and concentrations) and T-jump measurements (limited to relaxation in the neighborhood of equilibrium) for the ferro-ferricytochrome c (C(II)-C(III))/ferro-ferricyanide (FCN(II)-FCN(III)) system. The reagents generated in situ were C(II) or FCN(III). Kinetically indistinguishable binding sites exist on C(II) and C(III) for hexacyanide anions. Reductive electron transfer to the protein proceeds within the FCN(II)-C(III) complex, with a rate of 400 s-1. The binding of FCN(II) on C(II) slows down the oxidation of C(II) by FCN(III). The sites of interaction on C(II) or C(III) with FCN(III) show effective charges of approximately +2. The association constant per binding site derived from the kinetics of electron transfer is greater than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(II)-C(II) and less than or equal to 10(4) M-1 for FCN(III)-C(III). Specific clusters of amino acids in the model of cytochrome C are suggested as binding sites. The oxidation-reduction reactions of FCN appear to involve electron equivalent transfer to and from such somewhat remote binding sites on the protein. Anions such as phosphate or sulphate also bind to these, less strongly than hexacyanides. In the presence of perchlorate the kinetics show the resolution of the pK=9.3 of C(III) into two parts: (a) optical changes at 695 nm due to ligand interchange on the heme-iron, unaffected by perchlorate and (b), a kinetic change leading to biphasic oxidation of C(II), with pK=7.4. This is attributed to the effect of perchlorate on water structure in the close environment of the binding sites. The high rate of oxidation of relaxed C(II) by FCN(III), (2 X 10(8) M-1 S-1 at mu=0) is not in agreement with an outer sphere Marcus mechanism. Nonrelaxed C(II) having a structure closer to C(III) transfers electron to FCN(III) even faster (k=3 X 10(9) M-1 S-1 at mu=0)."
https://openalex.org/W1565823388,"Yeast alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase was found to be markedly stabilized by high concentrations of glycerol and (NH4)2SO4. Such conditions of high ionic strength inhibited the enzyme, stabilized the enzyme to heat, and affected kinetic parameters. The isomerase was found to exhibit ionic strength-dependent hysteresis when enzyme, totally but reversibly inhibited by storage under conditions of high ionic strength of (NH4)2SO4, was transferred to a lower concentration of (NH4)2SO4. Alpha-Isopropylmalate isomerase was found to be sensitive to KCN and certain other chelators. The inactivation by KCN was prevented by high concentrations of (NH4)2SO4. These observations implicated a metal involvement but the nature of the metal was not revealed. The metal involvement and some of the other properties of alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase reveal a similarity to aconitase. The similarities in properties between the isomerase and aconitase are summarized. Studies of yeast alpha-isopropylmalate isomerase indicated that it is a single polypeptide of about Mr = 90,000."
https://openalex.org/W1479687936,"5-Iodo-5'-amino-2',5'-dideoxyuridine-5'-N'-triphosphate (AIdUTP), a phosphoramidate analog of 5-iodo-2',5'-dideoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (IdUTP), was synthesized and some of its chemical and biological properties were investigated. Although AIdUTP is stable in alkaline solutions, below pH 8 it undergoes degradation by a novel phosphorylysis reaction which exhibits first order kinetics. Inclusion of magnesium ion in the reaction mixture decreased the rate of degradation. Protonation of a group on AIdUTP which has a pKa of 6.10, presumably the secondary ionized oxygen on the gamma phosphate, precedes phosphorylysis. The only detectable reaction products are the nucleoside, 5-iodo-5'-amino-2',5'-dideoxyuridine (AIdUrd), and trimetaphosphate. A mechanism for the acid catalyzed phosphorylysis of AIdUTP is proposed. AIdUTP, like TTP, converts Escherichia coli thymidine kinase into an inactive dimer with a sedimentation coefficient of 5.78 S. AIdUTP is, however, 60-fold more potent as an allosteric inhibitor than is TTP at pH 7.8. Although the inhibitory effect of TTP is markedly reduced at high pH, the activity of AIdUTP is lowered only slightly. The allosteric effects of AIdUTP also differ from those of IdUTP, which is an inhibitor at low pH but a strong activator above pH 7.4. 5-Iodo-2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, a potent enzyme activator, cannot completely reverse the AIdUTP inhibition, even when present at a 150-fold molar excess."
https://openalex.org/W1594971200,"Abstract The temperature dependence of the oxygen equilibrium of tadpole hemoglobin has been determined between 0 degrees and 32 degrees for the unfractionated but phosphate-free lysate and between 12 degrees and 32 degrees for each of the four isolated components between pH 6 and 10 in 0.05 M cacodylate, Tris, or glycine buffers containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. Under these conditions the Bohr effect (defined as deltalog p50/deltapH) of the unfractionated lysate is positive at low temperatures between pH 6 and 8.5 and is negative above pH 8.5 to 8.8 at any temperature. As the temperature rises the Bohr effect below pH 8.5 changes greatly. In the interval pH 7.0 to 7.5, the magnitude of the Bohr effect decreases from + 0.28 at 0 degrees to zero at about 24 degrees and becomes negative, as in mammalian hemoglobins, above this temperature. Measurements with the isolated components show that the temperature dependence of oxygen binding for Components I and II and for Components III and IV is very similar. For both sets of components the apparent overall enthalpy of oxygenation at pH 7.5 is about -16.4 kcal/mol and -12.6 kcal/mol at pH 9.5. The measured enthalpies include contributions from the active Bohr groups, the buffer ions themselves, the hemoglobin groups contributing buffering, and any pH-dependent, oxygenation-dependent binding of ions such as chloride by the hemoglobin. The apportioning of the total enthalpy among these various processes remains to be determined. Between pH 8 and 10.5 tadpole oxyhemoglobin undergoes a pH-dependent dissociation from tetramer to dimer. The pH dependence of the apparent tetramer-dimer dissociation constant indicates that at pH 9.5 the dissociation of each tetramer is accompanied by the release of approximately 2 protons. In this pH range the oxygen equilibrium measurements indicate that about 0.5 proton is released for each oxygen molecule bound. The results are consistent with the conclusion that one acid group per alphabeta dimer changes its pK from about 10 to 8 or below upon dissociation of the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1787445163,"Treatment of the cell wall tetrasaccharide GlcNAcbeta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc with alkali resulted in the formation of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-MurNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-delta2,3-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucoseen. The same compound was also formed by transglycosylation upon incubation of the unmodified tetrasaccharide with the unsaturated disaccharide GlcNAc-beta(1 leads to 4)-delta2,3-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucoseen (Tipper, D. J. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 1441-1449) and hen egg white lysozyme. The unsaturated tetrasaccharide was further characterized by paper electrophoresis, amino sugar analysis, and NMR. From NMR analysis it is concluded that the delta2,3-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucoseen at the reducing end of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide has a half-chair conformation. This conformation is similar to the one proposed for the sugar at subsite D in the lysozyme-substrate complex in the transition state. Addition of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide to a solution of hen egg white lysozyme quenched the fluorescence of the enzyme and shifted the fluorescence maximum to the blue, similar to the effect produced by the parent compound. The association constant of the unsaturated tetrasaccharide and lysozyme was measured at pH 6.0 and 24 degrees by spectrofluorimetry and microcalorimetry and found to be 1.45 X 10(5) M-1 and 2.5 X 10(5) M-1, respectively. The average value is 100 times higher than that found for the binding of unmodified tetrasaccharide to the enzyme under the same conditions. The unsaturated tetrasaccharide proved to be a better inhibitor of the lysis of Micrococcus luteus cells than the parent compound by a factor of 35. These results support the hypothesis that the active site of the enzyme is constructed so as to bind the transition state for the reaction it catalyzes more firmly than the substrate itself."
