In the present study we used PPARα knockout (KO) mice to determine whether this transcription factor is essential for regulating fuel metabolism in skeletal muscle. When animals were challenged with exhaustive exercise or starvation, KO mice exhibited lower serum levels of glucose, lactate, and ketones and higher nonesterified fatty acids than wild type (WT) littermates. During exercise, KO mice exhausted earlier than WT and exhibited greater rates of glycogen depletion in liver but not skeletal muscle. Fatty acid oxidative capacity was similar between muscles of WT and KO when animals were fed and only 28% lower in KO muscles when animals were starved. Exercise-induced regulation and starvation-induced regulation of pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 and uncoupling protein 3, two classical and robustly responsive PPARα target genes, were similar between WT and KO in skeletal muscle but markedly different between genotypes in heart. Real time quantitative PCR analyses showed that unlike in liver and heart, in mouse skeletal muscle PPARδ is severalfold more abundant than either PPARα or PPARγ. In both human and rodent myocytes, the highly selective PPARδ agonist GW742 increased fatty acid oxidation about 2-fold and induced expression of several lipid regulatory genes, including pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 and uncoupling protein 3, responses that were similar to those elicited by the PPARα agonist GW647. These results show redundancy in the functions of PPARs α and δ as transcriptional regulators of fatty acid homeostasis and suggest that in skeletal muscle high levels of the δ-subtype can compensate for deficiency of PPARα.

Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 239-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Strong evidence indicates that their endogenous ligands consist of fatty acids and/or lipid metabolites and that they function to mediate adaptive metabolic responses to changes in systemic fuel availability (1Kliewer S.A., Xu, H.E. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 239-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 2Su J.L. Simmons C.J. Wisely B. Ellis B. Winegar D.A. Hybridoma. 1998; 17: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PPARα, which is expressed most abundantly in tissues that are characterized by high rates of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), is considered the primary subtype that mediates lipid-induced activation of FAO genes (3Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). This premise is based largely on studies of PPARα knockout (KO) mice, which, compared with wild type (WT) littermates, exhibit low rates of β-oxidation and abnormal accumulation of neutral lipids in both cardiac and hepatic tissues (4Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The metabolic phenotype of KO mice is associated with decreased expression of FAO genes and failure of liver and heart to induce β-oxidative pathways in response to physiological or pharmacological perturbations in lipid metabolism (4Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 5Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P.

Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that, at least in rodents, PPARα plays an essential role in maintaining lipid homeostasis in liver and heart by modulating both constitutive and inducible expression of genes that regulate fatty acid catabolism. Skeletal muscle is also a major site of fatty acid catabolism in mammals. Similar to other oxidative organs, mRNA expression of muscle genes that promote selective utilization of lipid substrates is augmented during physiological states that are associated with increased systemic delivery of free fatty acids, such as exercise and starvation (7Pilegaard H. Ordway G.A. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E806-E814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sugden M.C. Kraus A. Harris R.A. Holness M.J. Biochem.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 298-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many of these same muscle genes are also up-regulated by in vivo administration of PPARα-selective drugs (11Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J., Wu, M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), prompting widespread speculation that fatty acid-induced activation of PPARα plays a critical role in mediating the adaptive response of muscle to starvation and exercise. PPARα protein expression is increased by exercise training (13Cresci S. Wright L.D. Spratt J.A. Briggs F.N. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1413-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Horowitz J.F. Leone T.C. Feng W. Kelly D.P. Klein S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E348-E355PubMed Google Scholar) and induced during myocyte differentiation, coincident with increased β-oxidative capacity (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Additionally, we recently showed that PPARα regulates fatty acid utilization and mRNA expression of several FAO genes in primary human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMC) (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that deficiency of PPARα might have profound consequences on skeletal muscle fuel metabolism and gene regulation. Pyruvate-dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDHK4) and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) represent two muscle target genes that are robustly induced by PPARα agonists (11Kelly L.J. Vicario P.P. Thompson G.M. Candelore M.R. Doebber T.W. Ventre J., Wu, M.S. Meurer R. Forrest M.J. Conner M.W. Cascieri M.A. Moller D.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4920-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Wu P.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E217-E221PubMed Google Scholar) and that are proposed to play key roles in mediating adaptive adjustments in muscle substrate selection. To investigate the requirement for PPARα in regulating muscle fatty acid metabolism and transcriptional activation of PDHK4 and UCP3, we evaluated metabolic and gene regulatory responses to 24 h of starvation and endurance exercise, as well as in vitro FAO, in muscles from PPARα KO mice and WT littermates. Contrary to our hypothesis, here we report that skeletal muscles from KO mice exhibited only minor changes in fatty acid homeostasis and, moreover, that neither constitutive nor inducible mRNA expression of known PPARα target genes was negatively affected by its absence. We also found that skeletal muscle expressed high levels of PPARδ and that in both rodent and human skeletal muscle cells, activation of the δ-subtype increased FAO as well as mRNA levels of several classical PPARα target genes. These results, which are the first to show significant overlap in the functions of PPARs α and δ, indicate that both subtypes play important roles in mediating lipid-induced regulation of β-oxidative pathways. We propose that high levels of PPARδ might compensate for the lack of PPARα in the skeletal muscles of KO mice. Bovine serum albumin, carnitine, and sodium oleate were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum and Hanks' balanced salt solution were from Invitrogen. Heat-inactivated horse serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Dulbecco's low glucose modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen. Human skeletal muscle cell SingleQuots® were from BioWhittaker Inc. (Walkersville, MD). Biocoat® tissue culture plates were from BD PharMingen. PCR reagents were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GW742, GW647, and GW929 were obtained from Dr. Peter Brown at GlaxoSmithKline (16Brown P.J.

All of the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at East Carolina University. 4–5-month-old female homozygous PPARα KO mice and aged matched WT littermates on an SV/129 background were obtained from a colony maintained at the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology (Research Triangle Park, NC). The original breeding pairs were obtained from Dr. F. Gonzalez (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (18Lee S.S. Gonzalez F.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The animals were housed under controlled temperature and lighting (20–22 °C; 12-h light-dark cycle) with free access to food and water. For starvation experiments, the food was removed at 10:00 a.m. the morning prior to collection of blood and tissue samples, which were harvested 24 h later along with samples from fed/rested and exercised mice. The mice were accustomed to the treadmill (Stanhope SAT 2000) with 5-min bouts of mild exercise (8 m/min) on three consecutive days prior to the experiment. The exercise test consisted of an incremental treadmill regimen during which mice ran at 10 m/min for the first 60 min. The speed was then increased 0.75 m/min at 15-min intervals, up to 13 m/min at 2 h. Mice in the 2-h exercise group were removed and immediately sacrificed for tissue and blood collection. The remaining mice continued running, and the treadmill speed was increased 1.0 m/min at 15-min intervals until the animals could no longer sustain the exercise. The exhausted mice were removed and immediately sacrificed for tissue and blood collection. Intact soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles from the fed mice were removed between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. under anesthesia (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine), cleaned free of adipose and connective tissue, and added to 1.0 ml of a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 1.0 mm [1-14C]oleate (1.0 μCi/ml), 1.0 mm carnitine, and 1.0% bovine serum albumin as described previously (19Muoio D.M. Dohm G.L. Tapscott E.B. Coleman R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E913-E921PubMed Google Scholar). After 90 min the incubation medium was transferred to new dishes, and the oleate oxidation rates (nmol/mg muscle weight/h) were determined by measuring production of14C-labeled acid-soluble metabolites (ASM), a measure of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and acetyl esters (incomplete oxidation) (20Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk H. Glatz J.F. Zuurveld J. Jacobs A. Wagenmakers A.J.M. Biochem. Med. Met. Biol. 1986; 35: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and [14C]CO2(complete oxidation) trapped in 200 μl of 1 n sodium hydroxide using a modified 48-well microtiter plate (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (21Kim J.Y. Hickner R.C. Cortright R.L. Dohm G.L. Houmard J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1039-E1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mixed gastrocnemius muscles were removed from mice that were fed or starved for 24 h. Approximately 90 mg of tissue was minced thoroughly with scissors in 300 μl of a modified sucrose-EDTA medium containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, as described previously (22Sholte H., Yu, Y. Ross J. Oosterkamp H. Boonman A. Busch H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reactions were initiated by adding 40 μl of whole homogenates to 160 μl of the incubation buffer, pH 7.4, yielding final concentrations of 0.2 mm oleate ([1-14C]oleate at 0.5 μCi/ml), 100 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm potassium phosphate, 80 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm l-carnitine, 0.1 mm malate, 2 mmATP, 0.05 mm coenzyme A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After 60 min at 37 °C, the reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of 70% perchloric acid. The CO2 and ASM produced during the incubation were measured as described previously (21Kim J.Y. Hickner R.C. Cortright R.L. Dohm G.L. Houmard J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1039-E1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from quick frozen muscle samples using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (23Jones J.P. Dohm G.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E682-E687PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (10 μg/sample) was fractionated on a 1.25% agarose, 2 mformaldehyde gel and then electrotransferred to a Hybond N1 membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Following UV cross-linking, the filters were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and then hybridized 2 h at 68 °C in Express Hyb buffer with random primed [α-32P]dATP-labeled cDNA probes for PDHK4 (24Way J.M.

After stripping and prehybridization, the blots were then hybridized sequentially with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-actin for normalization. The Northern blots were visualized with a PhosphorImager and quantified with Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Protocols for use of human specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board at East Carolina University. Muscle samples weighing ∼50 mg were obtained from vastus lateralis by needle biopsy and immediately transferred to ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cleaned free of adipose and connective tissues. Satellite cells were isolated by trypsin digestion (25Henry R.R. Ciaraldi T.P. Abrams-Carter L. Mudaliar S. Park K.S. Nikoulina S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1231-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) preplated for 1–3 h in 3.0 ml of growth medium (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) on an uncoated T-25 tissue culture flask to remove fibroblasts and then transferred to a type I collagen-coated T25 flask for attachment. Myoblasts were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and subcultured onto 6-, 12-, and 24-well type I collagen-coated plates as described previously (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J.

When HSkMC reached 80–90% confluence, differentiation was induced by changing to low serum differentiation medium (DFM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% horse serum, 4.0 mm glutamine, 50 mg/ml gentamycin) (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The medium was changed every 2 days, and PPAR-selective compounds or Me2SO vehicle (0.1% v/v) were added to mature myotubes for 48 h on days 6–7. GW647 (16Brown P.J. Stuart L.W. Hurley K.P.

Day 8 myotubes were harvested in 1.0 ml of TRIzol reagent for RNA extraction. Early passages of rat L6 myoblasts (CRL-1458) from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.0 mmglutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The myoblasts were grown on 100-mm dishes to 50–60% confluence and then subcultured onto 6- and 24-well plates for experiments. When the cells were 70% confluent, they were induced to differentiate into myotubes by changing to low serum DFM. By day 6, the cells were fully confluent and had differentiated into multinucleated, contracting myotubes. Day 8 myotubes were treated for 48 h with vehicle and PPAR-selective compounds and then harvested as described for HSkMC. Following treatments with vehicle or PPAR-selective compounds, the myotubes were incubated at 37 °C in sealed 12- or 24-well plates containing 500 or 750 μl of DFM plus 12.5 mm HEPES, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mmcarnitine, 100 μm sodium oleate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1.0 μCi/ml [14C]oleate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences ). After 3 h the incubation medium was transferred to new dishes and assayed for labeled oxidation products (CO2 and ASM) (21Kim J.Y. Hickner R.C. Cortright R.L. Dohm G.L. Houmard J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1039-E1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were placed on ice, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube in two additions of 0.30 ml of 0.05% SDS lysis buffer, and then stored at −80 °C. All of the assays were performed in triplicate. Total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent, treated with DNase I (Ambion) and quantified using the RiboGreen® RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). RTQ-PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system instrument and software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primer/probe sets were designed using the manufacturer's software and the sequences available in the GenBankTM data base. The sequences for the rat genes were: CPT1, F: GCTTATTAAGAACACGAGCCAACAA, R: AGTTTGCGGCGATACATGATC, P: TTGGGAAACACCGTTCACGCCA; PDHK4, F: TCTAACGTCGCCAGAATTAAAGC, R: GGAACGTACACGATGTGGATTG, P: ACACAAGTCAATGGAAAATTTCCAGGCCAA; UCP3, F: TGGCCTCCCCAGTGGAT, R: GGGCTTCGGTACCTGCCT, P: TAAAGACCCGATACATGAACGCTCCC. The sequences for the mouse genes were: PPARα, F: ACGATGCTGTCCTCCTTGATG, R: GTGTGATAAAGCCATTGCCGT, P: ACAAAGACGGGATGCTGATCGCG; PPARδ, F: GCTGCTGCAGAAGATGGCA, R: CACTGCATCATCTGGGCATG, P: ACCTGCGGCAGCTGGTCACTGA; PPARγ, F: CCATTCTGGCCCACCAAC, R: AATGCGAGTGGTCTTCCATCA, P: TCGGAATCAGCTCTGTGGACCTCTCC. The sequences used for analysis of human genes were published previously (15Muoio D.M. Way J.M. Tanner C.J. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Houmard J.A. Kraus W.E. Dohm G.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RNA samples were normalized for comparison by determining 18 S rRNA levels by RTQ-PCR. PPAR subtype expression in mouse tissues was analyzed by generating six-point serial standard curves using total RNA from heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. Estimates of relative mRNA abundance (arbitrary units) were determined by the ratio of calculated units of RNA from each tissue. The calculations were made using the portion of the curve for which the plot of the log input amountversus the C T (cycle threshold) differences resulted in a slope of approximately 0, indicating that the amplicon efficiencies were approximately equal. Relative quantitation of PPAR target genes in cultured myocytes was calculated by using the 2ΔCT formula, in which ΔC Tequals the difference between C T values for vehicle (Me2SO) and drug-treated cells. This formula was validated for each primer/probe set using six-point serial standard curves as described previously (24Way J.M. Harrington W.W. Brown K.K. Gottschalk W.K. Sundseth S.S. Mansfield T.A. Ramachandran R.K. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1269-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using JMP Statistical Software (SAS, Cary, NC). Two- and three-way ANOVAs were performed using a standard least squares model to test both the main and interaction effects of genotype × starvation or exercise × time (where appropriate) on serum parameters and mRNA expression. In HSkMC and L6 myocytes differences in FAO rates and mRNA expression (C T values) were analyzed by Student's t test for paired data. Consistent with earlier reports (4Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), we found that the body weights of older KO mice (23.4 ± 0.73 g) were greater than their WT littermates (21.7 ± 0.98 g). The effects of PPARα ablation on muscle fuel metabolism were first evaluated during in vivo studies that compared the metabolic responses to 24 h of starvation with that of endurance exercise. We found that when KO mice were challenged by 24 h of starvation, they exhibited increased serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and hypoketonemia (Fig. 1, A andB) but showed no changes in serum glycerol (not shown) compared with WT. These results are consistent with previous studies (4Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin.

Moreover, because starvation fully depletes liver glycogen levels (Fig.2), gluconeogenesis becomes the primary pathway for sustaining blood glucose. KO mice exhibited hypoglycemia, consistent with reduced liver gluconeogenic capacity, and lower serum lactate levels, suggesting increased dependence on this substrate as a gluconeogenic precursor (Fig. 1, C and D). These metabolic abnormalities observed in KO mice after 24 h of starvation were remarkably similar to those exhibited in response to exercise, and as predicted, time to exhaustion (180 ± 35versus 150 ± 15 min; p < 0.05) and total distance run (1.80 versus 1.37 km; p< 0.01) were greater in WT compared with KO, respectively, indicating that KO mice are less tolerant of endurance exercise. Notably, depletion of liver rather than muscle glycogen corresponded with exhaustion in both groups (Fig. 2). Moreover, estimated rates of liver glycogen depletion were ∼50% greater in null compared with WT mice, whereas in contrast, muscle glycogen depletion rates were similar between genotypes. These findings suggested that, contrary to our prediction, PPARα ablation might not increase the reliance of muscle on glucose substrate.Figure 2Glycogen depletion in skeletal muscle and liver. Glycogen content was measured in liver (A) and muscle (B) from WT and KO mice that were fed/rested, exercised for 2 h, exercised to exhaustion, or starved for 24 h.

In the fed state, rates of muscle FAO were similar between WT and null mice (Table I), regardless of the fiber composition, implying that PPARα is not required to maintain constitutive activity of muscle FAO enzymes. When animals were starved for 24 h, FAO rates were 28% lower in muscle homogenates from KO compared with WT mice, but neutral lipid accumulation, analyzed by Oil Red O staining, was not different between genotypes (not shown).

Under normoxic conditions, HIF-α proteins interact with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein, pVHL (6Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C.

This posttranslational modification is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, resulting in stabilization of HIF-α protein levels, possibly due to reduced binding of O2 to HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes that require Fe(II) and O2 for function (12Bruick R.K.

In addition to stabilization of HIF-α protein levels, hypoxia induces the function of the transactivation domains of HIF-α proteins and enhances their ability to interact with transcriptional coactivator proteins (3Ema M.

This interaction has recently been shown to be blocked by hydroxylation under normoxic conditions of a conserved asparagine residue within one of the two transactivation domains of HIF-1α and HIF-2α (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Asparagine hydroxylation is abrogated under hypoxic conditions (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), and it has been speculated that both the prolyl and asparagine hydroxylases modulating HIF-α function may serve as oxygen sensors in the hypoxia signal transduction pathway. We have previously identified a novel factor, IPAS, that functions as a dominant negative regulator of HIF-α function. IPAS dimerizes with HIF-α proteins and thereby impairs productive interaction between HIF-α and hypoxia response elements of target genes (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Expression of IPAS in the cornea correlates with low levels of expression of the HIF-1α target gene vascular endothelial growth factor under hypoxic conditions (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that IPAS defines a novel mechanism of negative regulation of angiogenesis and maintenance of an avascular phenotype. Here we demonstrate that IPAS is an alternative splicing product of the HIF-3α locus. Interestingly, accumulation of the IPAS-specific alternative splicing product was hypoxia-inducible in the mouse heart and lung, indicating a previously unknown mode of negative feedback loop regulation of HIF-α-mediated signaling pathways in these tissues. BLAST searches of GenBankTMwere performed using the BLAST (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59382) Google Scholar) service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) home page (www.ncbi.nih.gov) using our previously reported mouse IPAS cDNA sequence (18Makino Y.

Eight-week-old C57Bl6 mice were exposed to either normoxia or hypoxia (maximally 6% O2) for 6 h, and total RNA samples from various tissues were obtained by the guanidine isothiocyanate method. All animal experiments were approved by the local animal research ethics committee of Stockholm, Sweden and the Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan and conducted according to their guidelines. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT)25 primer and 2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA as a template followed by a semiquantitative PCR analysis for IPAS- and HIF-3α-specific transcript levels relative to β-actin mRNA expression. To ensure that the PCR was in the exponential phase, different PCR cycles (ranging from 27 to 36) were tested,and 33 cycles of amplification were applied in most experiments unless otherwise specified. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. PCR primer pairs and annealing temperatures (ATs) for amplification of the exons were as follows: (i) exons 1a–16 of IPAS: sense (primer1), 5′-AGGGCGAGCCATGGCGTT-3′; antisense (primer2), 5′-TTTGTGGGTTTCTGGGCTAAG-3′; AT, 58 °C; (ii) exons 1–7 of HIF-3α: sense (primer3), 5′-GCTAAGTCCCGGAGAGGA-3′; antisense (primer4), 5′-TCCAAAGCGTGGATGTATTC-3′; AT, 54 °C; (iii) exon 4a of IPAS: sense (primer5), 5′-GAGGGTTTCGTCATGGTACT-3′; antisense (primer6), 5′-TCTTGAAGTTCCTCTTGGTC-3′; AT, 49 °C; (iv) exons 6–7 of HIF-3α: sense (primer7), 5′-CACTGCTCAGGACATATGAG-3′; antisense (primer8), 5′-TCCAAAGCGTGGATGTATTC-3′; AT, 49 °C; and (v) exons 6–16 of IPAS: sense (primer7), 5′-CACTGCTCAGGACATATGAG-3′; antisense (primer9), 5′-AGAGAGGATTCAGTCCCTT-3′; AT, 49 °C. Sequencing of mouse genomic DNA revealed that the IPAS mRNA species contains a unique first exon (GenBankTMaccession number AF481145) but shares exon 2 with HIF-3α (Fig.1). We have therefore used the exon numbering of the HIF-3α locus (5Gu Y.Z. Moran S.M. Hogenesch J.B. Wartman L. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar) and termed the first exon of IPAS exon 1a of the HIF-3α locus. In addition to exon 1a, IPAS mRNA contains the unique exons 4a (GenBankTM accession numberAF481146) and 16 (GenBankTM accession number AF481147). Moreover, a mechanism of IPAS pre-mRNA splice site selection in exon 3 uses an alternative 3′ splice site 14 nucleotides downstream of the HIF-3α 3′ splice site. In a similar fashion in IPAS mRNA exon 6 an alternative 5′ splice site located 87 nucleotides upstream of the HIF-3α 5′ splice site is used (Fig. 1). The inclusion of exon 4a together with the use of the alternative 3′ splice site in exon 3 during IPAS mRNA processing results in a reading frame shift that determines a unique feature of IPAS. In conclusion, the IPAS mRNA is a product of alternative splicing of the HIF-3α locus. We next used primers specific for either IPAS or HIF-3α mRNAs (schematically represented in Fig.2) to monitor by RT-PCR analysis mRNA expression of these two mRNA species in heart tissue from control mice or mice exposed to hypoxia (6% O2) for 6 h. In agreement with earlier observations using RNA blot analysis (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) we observed that hypoxia induces IPAS mRNA expression levels (Fig. 2). Interestingly, this analysis also indicated a corresponding down-regulation of HIF-3α mRNA levels (Fig. 2). RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from several control and hypoxic mouse tissues using a number of primers specific for the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of IPAS confirmed that we have obtained the full-length IPAS reading frame (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and, importantly, in similar analyses we have not detected any form of mouse HIF-3α mRNA that is generated by transcription of exon 1a. We next monitored the use of the IPAS-specific exon 4a in transcripts isolated from control or hypoxic mouse heart and lung tissues. As shown in Fig. 3, a transcript containing the IPAS-specific exon 4a was detected in these tissues only following exposure of the mice to hypoxia. The analysis was performed following different cycles of PCR amplification, demonstrating that the assay was performed within a linear range of amplification (Fig. 3). Thus, these results strongly suggest that accumulation of the IPAS splicing product is hypoxia-inducible in mouse heart and lung. In support of this model, analysis of the generation of the alternatively spliced form of exon 6, which is specific for IPAS mRNA, demonstrated the presence of this splicing product only in hypoxic mice (Fig.4). Taken together these data demonstrate that accumulation of the IPAS-specific alternative splicing product of the HIF-3α locus in mouse heart and lung is regulated by hypoxia.Figure 4Hypoxia-inducible accumulation of the IPAS-specific transcript of the HIF-3α locus. The presence of the IPAS-specific transcript containing a truncated version of exon 6 was monitored. RNA samples from either heart or lung tissue from control mice (maintained under normoxic conditions (N)) and mice exposed to hypoxia (H) were subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis using exon-specific sets of primers as indicated. β-Actin mRNA levels were monitored as a reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the degree of hypoxia required to induce accumulation of the IPAS-specific splicing product of the HIF-3α gene in mouse heart, mice were exposed for 6 h to increasing degrees of hypoxia ranging from 18 to 6% O2. The IPAS-specific splicing product was first observed following exposure of mice to rather severe hypoxia, i.e. 8–6% O2 (Fig. 5). In summary, our results demonstrate that the dominant negative regulator of HIF-α function, IPAS, is generated by alternative splicing of the HIF-3α locus. Obviously, our data do not preclude the existence of intermediate splicing variants. In fact, as indicated by a comprehensive search of expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases there are human HIF-3α transcript variants that include the IPAS-specific exon 1a and also contain the IPAS-specific variant of exon 3 but lack the IPAS-specific exon 4a (Fig. 6). It is presently premature to conclude whether these EST sequences reflect splicing intermediates or fully processed mature transcripts. Against this background, it will be important to perform a careful genetic analysis in mice to determine the role of IPAS and possibly HIF-3α in regulation of hypoxia signaling. Interestingly, accumulation of the IPAS-specific alternative splicing product of the HIF-3α locus is hypoxia-inducible in mouse heart and lung tissues. During maintenance of mice under normoxic conditions, IPAS mRNA is expressed in a very tissue-restricted manner with readily detectable levels only found in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum and the cornea epithelium (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the case of the latter tissue, the function of IPAS appears to provide a strategy of negative regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression and angiogenesis. This mode of negative regulation of HIF-1α function is important for the avascular phenotype of the cornea (18Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Åsman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Hypoxia-inducible alternative splicing of the HIF-3α locus resulting in hypoxia-inducible IPAS mRNA expression in the heart and lung suggests that IPAS may modulate hypoxia- or ischemia-dependent adaptive gene regulatory responses in these tissues as well. Thus, in these tissues, hypoxia-inducible accumulation of the IPAS-specific alternative splicing product of the HIF-3α locus not only defines a novel mechanism of hypoxia-dependent gene regulation but also a potential mechanism of negative feedback loop regulation of HIF-α-mediated signaling pathways, which may be of considerable medical interest."

For example, neuronal cells express predominant levels of Cx43 and are surrounded by supporting Schwann cells that express Cx32. Although the connexins expressed by these cells can be defined, the role of gap junctions in the intimate relationship between cells in such tissues is not thoroughly understood. However, gap junctions are critical for normal system function as evidenced by aberrant connexin expression being associated with specific disorders. For instance, loss of Cx32 may underlie Charcot-Mari-Tooth syndrome (14Ressot C. Bruzzone R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 32: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), while suppression of Cx43 is associated with neoplastic transformation including brain tumorigenesis (15Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Knowledge of actual signals mediated by gap junctions may help illuminate the functions of connexins and the consequence of their misregulation in such systems.We introduce a layered culture system here that can be used to directly study the transfer of endogenous metabolites through gap junctions. The present studies indicate that gap junctions composed of Cx32 and Cx43 allow differential exchange of cellular metabolites that would not necessarily be expected from predictions of pore diameters and charge selectivity. For example, we demonstrate that addition of phosphate can shift the permselectivity of adenosine from channels formed by Cx32 to those formed by Cx43 by over 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, different connexins produce channels with very different properties to selectively transfer signals unique to specific cell types.DISCUSSIONThis report introduces a novel strategy to identify and quantitate the transfer of specific transjunctional metabolites. We isolated 10 metabolites of glucose as transjunctional molecules. The isolation of a specific transjunctional compound from Receivers does not necessarily indicate that it traveled through a channel. For example, transjunctional glutamate may have contributed to the presence of radioactive glutathione and dephosphorylation of transjunctional ATP may have contributed to ADP, AMP, and adenosine in Receiver cells. In any case, the biological consequences of gap junctional communication may rely on the fate of transferred molecules as well as the actual transjunctional molecule itself. Because our data indicate that homomeric channels formed from Cx32 and Cx43 show very different conductive properties for endogenous molecules, they suggest that the two do not transfer the same panel of transjunctional molecules and likely play distinct roles.Bevans and Harris (25Bevans C.G. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3720-3725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have reported the existence of high affinity binding sites for cGMP and cAMP that affect permeability through hemichannels composed of Cx32 and Cx26. These interactions seem specific because other nucleotides including AMP, ADP, ATP, cTMP, and cCMP had no effect. In addition, cGMP transferred more readily through hemichannels formed by Cx32 than heteromeric channels formed by Cx32 and Cx26 (26Bevans C.G. Kordel M. Rhee S.K. Harris A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, the channels used for these studies consisted of connexins incorporated into liposomes. Therefore, this previous work assayed the permeability of hemichannels, or connexons, as opposed to complete gap junctions. Nonetheless, the data demonstrate sensitive interactions between specific connexins and endogenous metabolites. We have more recently confirmed this scenario by documenting the preferential transfer of specific metabolites through channels composed of Cx32 and Cx43 (11Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Nicholson B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In contrast to previous investigations, this study presents an approach designed to examine communication through gap junctions between organized cell layers that may resemble the order of tissues that existin vivo. In addition to identifying several transjunctional metabolites, these results indicate that that phosphorylation of adenosine alters its permselectivity from channels formed by Cx32 to those of Cx43. Consistent with other reports, we have found that size and charge alone do not exclusively dictate the relative abilities of unrelated molecules to pass through channels made from different connexins (10Elfgang C. Eckert R. Lichtenberg-Frate H. Butterweck A. Traub O. Klein R.A. Hulser D.F. Willecke K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 11Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2808-2816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).As shown in Fig. 8, adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP are likely to exhibit a similar overall shape. Increasing phosphorylation of adenosine would increase both the size and negative charge of the molecule (ATP is 240 Daltons larger and has three more negative charges than adenosine). A simplistic interpretation would be that Cx32 forms channels that restrict the passage of larger and more negatively charged molecules. However, the relative permselectivities of Cx32 and Cx43 may not be completely dictated by the formula weight or net charge of the permeant. For example, some significantly larger and more negatively charged compounds than ATP, such as calcein with a molecular weight of 623 and charge of −5, transfer equally well through gap junctions formed by either connexin (11Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Nicholson B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the contrasting permeabilities of adenosine, AMP, ADP, and ATP through channels formed by Cx32 or Cx43 indicate that charge probably in combination with molecular shape may regulate the permselectivity of closely related molecular species, in this case metabolic currency in the form of adenosine and ATP.Reduction of connexin expression often accompanies cell transformation. In the case of C6 glioma cells, the major endogenous gap junction protein, Cx43, is reduced compared with normal glial cells or astrocytes (15Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Restoration of gap junctional communication by transfection with Cx43 induces contact growth inhibition of C6 cells, while Cx32 does not (12Goldberg G.S. Bechberger J.F. Tajima Y. Merritt M. Omori Y. Gawinowicz M.A. Narayanan R. Tan Y. Sanai Y. Yamasaki H. Naus C.C. Tsuda H. Nicholson B.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6018-6026PubMed Google Scholar). Although a contribution by low basal levels of endogenous Cx43 that persists in these cells (as shown in Fig. 4) can not be excluded, the addition of Cx32 significantly altered the permselectivity of the channels to natural metabolites. Therefore, this system illustrates how the differential transfer of molecules through gap junctions between cells may have functional significance. Indeed, heteromeric and heterotypic connexin combinations may produce channels with stunning complexity to selectively transfer signals that underlie many processes in specific cell types. Gap junctions are formed by integral membrane proteins, called connexins (commonly abbreviated by Cx1 followed by their molecular mass in kilodaltons), which have evolved into a family of ∼20 members in humans (1Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). All connexins share the structural motifs of four transmembrane domains, intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, a cytoplasmic loop, and two extracellular loops involved in docking interactions with connexins of adjacent cells (2Yeager M. Nicholson B.J. Curr. Opin. Structur. Biol. 1996; 6: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These multiple connexins enable selective interactions between family members, differential modes of regulation (3Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.

https://openalex.org/W1990324370,"Members of the TGF-β family of growth factors signal from the cell surface through serine/threonine kinase receptors. Intracellular propagation of the signal occurs by phosphorylation of intracellular proteins of the Smad family. Smad7 belongs to the subclass of inhibitory Smads that function as antagonists of TGF-β signaling. A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human placental cDNA expression library using full-length mouse Smad7 as bait identified Yes-Associated Protein (YAP65) as a novel Smad7-interacting protein. The association of Smad7 with YAP65 was confirmed using co-expressed tagged proteins in COS-7 cells. Deletion of the PY motif of Smad7 reduced but did not abolish YAP65-Smad7 association, suggesting the existence of several interacting domains. We demonstrate that YAP65 potentiates the inhibitory activity of Smad7 against TGF-β-induced, Smad3/4-dependent, gene transactivation. Furthermore, YAP65 augments the association of Smad7 to activated TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI), whereas YAP65(1–301), which exerts a dominant-negative effect against Smad7-driven inhibition of TGF-β signaling, reduces these interactions. Together, these data provide the first evidence that YAP65 is a Smad7 partner that facilitates the recruitment of the latter to activated TβRI, and enhances the inhibitory activity of Smad7 against TGF-β signaling."

Sci. 1997; 22: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Desiraju G.R. Steiner T. The Weak Hydrogen Bond in Structural Chemistry and Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Much of the evidence for the CH···O hydrogen bond comes from the observation that short intermolecular CH···O contacts are well established in many small molecule crystals (12Taylor R. Kennead O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5063-5070Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 13Steiner T. Saenger W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10146-10154Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In more recent years, neutron diffraction studies of amino acid crystals (which yield highly accurate positions of hydrogen atoms experimentally) have provided convincing evidence in favor of the ability of the carbon atoms to function directly as hydrogen bond donors in CH···O contacts (14Jeffrey G.A. Maluszynska H. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1982; 4: 173-185Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Recently, there have been surveys of high resolution protein structures that reveal the widespread occurrence of weak CH···O hydrogen bonds (15Thomas K.T. Smith G.M. Thomas T.B. Feldmann R.J. Proc.

Various studies have reported the existence of a weak CαH···O hydrogen bond between the parallel β-sheets in proteins (17Derewenda Z.S. Derewenda U. Kobos P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 59Fabiola G.F. Krishnaswamy S. Nagarajan V. Pattabhi V. Acta Crystallogr.

At the same time, some mutation studies on protein-ligand interactions have reported that weak CH···O bonds stabilize protein-ligand complexes (10Wahl M.C. Sundaralingam M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Musah R.A. Jensen G.M. Rosenfeld R.J. McRee D.E. Goodin D.B. Bunte S.W. J. Am. Chem.

Similar to protein-ligand interfaces, close CH···O contacts abound at protein-protein interfaces. Although CH···O H-bonds are normally weaker than conventional hydrogen bonds, their number cannot be neglected. The CH···O hydrogen bonding interaction is also thought to be important for the interactions of nucleic acids with proteins and drug binding (6Takahara P.M. Frederick C.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 12309-12321Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 24Mandel-Gutfreund Y. Margalit H. Jernigan R.L. Zhurkin V.B. J. Mol.

Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G. Science. 1998; 281: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar); and thus, it would be surprising if CH···O interactions were less important in protein interfaces. In fact, the CH···O hydrogen bonding interaction has been considered to be so important that many crystal refinement programs that treat CH···O contacts as repulsive have been called into question (10Wahl M.C. Sundaralingam M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 97-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 27Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem.

Biol. 1997; 274: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).However, the energy contribution of this kind of interaction to the stability of protein-protein complexes as compared with other forces remains to be explored. Despite the finding of numerous CH···O contacts at protein-protein interfaces, their relative importance in the protein recognition or drug binding process remains unclear. Although some structural analyses have provided a wealth of information about average hydrophobicities and residue compositions of protein-protein complexes (29Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 30Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jones S.

Novoa J.J. Whangbo M.-H. Williams J.M. Chem. Phys. 1995; 200: 319-335Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Novoa J.J. Mota F. Chem. Phys.

Advances in Molecular Structure Research. 6. Jai Press Inc., Stamford, CT2000: 159-207Google Scholar). Ab initio quantum calculation has shown that a small molecule such as CH2F2 can establish an H-bond with the strength similar to a conventional OH···O interaction (38Gu Y. Kar T. Scheiner S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9411-9422Crossref Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Recently, theab initio quantum calculation for the CαH···O hydrogen bond of some representative amino acid residues (39Scheiner S. Kar T. Gu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9832-9837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the peptide CH group is a potent proton donor and that the CH···O interaction appears to be a true hydrogen bond. Furthermore, the study also showed that some CH···O bonds are even stronger than a conventional OH···O interaction, suggesting that the CH···O hydrogen bonding interactions in proteins need to be paid more attention.Ab initio quantum calculation (39Scheiner S. Kar T. Gu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9832-9837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) gave a series of calculated binding strengths for the CαH···O contacts of different amino acid residues in an ideal model. However, the energy percentage of the CH···O interaction is still not known (i.e. the ratio of the CH···O interaction in the total binding energy of protein complexes). Thus, the relative importance of the CH···O interaction in protein association remains somewhat an open question.Here, for the first time, we calculate the average energy percentage of the CH···O interaction in total free binding energy using our established mean-field potential for describing protein-protein complexes (40Jiang L. Gao Y. Mao F.L. Liu Z.J. Lai L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 46: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The potentials of mean force (PMFs),1 a beneficial tool in protein fold recognition, generally use the training data base of known protein structures to extract “pseudo-potentials” for predicting unknown structures (41Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 42Sippl M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Myers E.W. Miller W. Bull.

Many applications have demonstrated their usefulness in studies of protein-ligand binding (50Wallqvist A. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G.

Biol. 1998; 283: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Based on the new definition of atom types and our developed method, the distance-dependent potentials have been derived to describe different types of interactions at the protein-protein interface, and the energy aspects of CH···O interactions have been discussed quantitatively. The calculated energies of CH···O pair interactions exhibit a feature typical of a hydrogen bond. A quantitative study of the energy percentage has shown the importance of the CH···O hydrogen bond at the protein interface. The obvious structural motif of a bifurcated hydrogen bond is highlighted in the stereochemical analysis of CH···O contacts in the representative examples with a high CH···O percentage. We expect that this method would be helpful in understanding the interactions at protein-protein interfaces and how they drive protein-protein associations.MATERIALS AND METHODSWe use the established empirical approach for the description of protein-protein association from an energy aspect. The mean-field potentials were derived from the same training set as that used before (40Jiang L. Gao Y. Mao F.L. Liu Z.J. Lai L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 46: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Using the methodology as described in our previous work, we implicitly treated solvation and entropic effects and directly estimated total free binding energies of protein-protein complexes without any knowledge of experimental binding affinities and fitting procedures.New Definition of Five Atom TypesTo extract and characterize the CH···O hydrogen bonding interactions, five atom types were defined: hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), both donor and acceptor (B), CH type (neutral atom bonded to hydrogen atoms) (CH), and neutral type (neither donor nor acceptor) (N). In the atom type definition, primary and secondary amines are defined as donors; oxygen and nitrogen atoms with no bound hydrogen are defined as acceptors; hydroxyl oxygen, ND, NE of His, and carboxyl oxygen in the C terminus are defined as both donors and acceptors; carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms are defined as the CH type; and carbon atoms with no bound hydrogen and sulfur atoms are defined as neither donors nor acceptors. The atom occupancy in the crystal structure file was used as a weighting factor.The distance-dependent Helmholtz free energies of protein-protein complexes were extracted from the non-redundant training set (40Jiang L. Gao Y. Mao F.L. Liu Z.J. Lai L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 46: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (43Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F.

Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26670) Google Scholar). Atoms of the “receptor” part and the “ligand” part are treated differently, so we calculated 25 atom pair interaction terms here (see Table I). In our training set, metal and hetero-atoms were excluded. It is assumed that all crystallized complexes use water as the medium. Water molecules are neglected, as the solvation effects are implicitly treated. Hydrogen atoms were omitted in all analyses.Table IAtom pair interaction typesAtom typeA1-aHydrogen bond acceptor.D1-bHydrogen bond donor.CH1-cCH type (carbon atom bonding to hydrogen atoms).N1-dNeutral type (neither donor nor acceptor; carbon atoms with no bound hydrogens and sulfur atoms, main chain nitrogen atom of the proline).B1-eBoth hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.A—1-fSteric interaction.Conventional hydrogen bondCH···O hydrogen bondHydrophobicConventional hydrogen bondDConventional hydrogen bond—HydrophobicHydrophobicConventional hydrogen bondCHCH···O hydrogen bondHydrophobicHydrophobicHydrophobicCH···O hydrogen bondNHydrophobicHydrophobicHydrophobicHydrophobicHydrophobicBConventional hydrogen bondConventional hydrogen bondCH···O hydrogen bondHydrophobicConventional hydrogen bond1-a Hydrogen bond acceptor.1-b Hydrogen bond donor.1-c CH type (carbon atom bonding to hydrogen atoms).1-d Neutral type (neither donor nor acceptor; carbon atoms with no bound hydrogens and sulfur atoms, main chain nitrogen atom of the proline).1-e Both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor.1-f Steric interaction. Open table in a new tab Statistical PotentialsPair potentials were derived from the training set using the same methodology described in our previous work (40Jiang L. Gao Y. Mao F.L. Liu Z.J. Lai L.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 46: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, we give only a brief description of the method.According to the reverse Boltzmann relationship, the free energy between the receptor atom of type i and the ligand atom of type j at a distance r can be written as shown in Equation1, Aij=−kT lnfij(r)/ZijEquation 1 where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. f ij(r) is the frequency of these ij contacts occurring at distance r. In fact, our statistical potential ΔA ij(r) is the difference relative to the reference potential shown in Equation 2, Aij−reference energy≡ΔAij(r)Equation 2 =kT ln1+mijς−kT ln1+mijςgij(r)f(r)where m ij is the total number of contacts between types i and j, g ij(r) is the distribution of these contacts occurring at distance r, andf(r) is the distribution of all contacts for all types at distance r. The atom pair distance ruses a histogram-based representation, and r refers here to a given bin of width 0.2 Å. We simplified our reference energy as follows: we just imported a large value in a very short distance (i.e. where our statistics are not included) to capture strong van der Waals repulsive potentials in this distance range.The derived potentials for the interaction of receptor atom type i and ligand atom type j are summed up to evaluate the total PMF value in Equation 3, A=∑ijΔAij(r)×ΔijEquation 3 where Δij = 0 for r ij >r cutoff and Δij =p i × p j forr ij ≤ r cutoff. For atom presentations, the occupancy ratio p i was used as a weighting coefficient. The occurrence of the atom pair in a distance <8.0 Å was recorded. If the total number of atom pairs in the shell of a distance r ± Δr(Δr = 0.1 Å) was <30, the contributions of all atom pairs at the distance interval were ignored because of their statistically insufficient data.Contribution of Different Interactions to the Total Free Binding Energy in Each Protein-Protein ComplexWe applied the statistical potentials to a larger set of protein-protein complexes. The x-ray and NMR structures of protein-protein complexes with a more flexible threshold of resolution were selected. For the data set, if the calculated binding energy of analyzed protein interfaces was not appropriate (only the calculated energy within the range of −200 to −10 kJ/mol was selected), the data were abandoned in analyses. Metal ions and water molecules were excluded in all analysis. The filtered set included 654 “receptor protein-ligand protein” pairs from 469 x-ray structures of protein-protein complexes, including antigen-antibody complexes, enzyme-protein inhibitor complexes, heterodimers, and protease-peptide complexes in a wide range of data sets (see the Supplemental Material).For each protein complex, the contributions of different interaction types to the total binding energy were calculated as shown in Equation 4, pz=∑i′,j′ΔAi′,j′×Δi′,j′AEquation 4 where z represents a certain type of pair interaction (see TableI). p z is the energy percentage of the interaction of type z to the total free binding energy of the calculated protein-protein complex. The pair interaction between atoms i′ and j′ is type z, according to the definition in Table I. The denominator A represents the total PMF energy calculated by Equation 3.Analysis of the Stereochemistry of CH···O Hydrogen BondsThe stereochemical details of CH···O hydrogen bonds in some representative examples with a high energy percentage of CH···O interactions were surveyed. Hydrogen atoms were added to these Protein Data Bank coordinate files using CHARMM (61Brook B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13842) Google Scholar). Each of the CH···O hydrogen bonds was analyzed using three different geometrical parameters: the C···O distance (d), the H···O distance (d H), and the C–H–O angle (θ). The definitions of these parameters are given Tables II and III. In the analysis, only those contacts with a θ angle >100° were accepted.Table IIStereochemistry of selected CH···O hydrogen bonds in some representative examplesPDB codeAcceptorC–H donorCalculated energy2-aThe pair energy is recalculated by the potentials.d2-bd represents the interatomic C···O distance, i.e. the donor-acceptor distance of the CH···O hydrogen bond.d H 2-cdH represents the H···O distance, i.e. the CH···O H-bond distance.θ2-dθ represents the C–H–O angle of the CH···O hydrogen bond.kJ/molÅÅAdjacent β-strands in parallel orientation2kinO Arg297BCαGly80A−1.93.222.26145.6°2kinO Thr81ACαThr298B−1.53.442.49129.9°2kinO Thr299BCαIle82A−1.93.212.19157.4°2kinO Phe83ACαIle300B−2.03.352.44140.2°2kinO Val301BCαAla84A−1.93.222.26145.9°2kinO Tyr85ACαIle302B−2.03.292.37141.0°Adjacent β-strands in antiparallel orientation1apyO Asp65ACαSer200B−1.53.532.60143.1°1apyO Thr199BCαAla66A−1.93.402.40148.6°1apyO Met67ACαGly198B−2.03.202.36152.0°1apyO Ala197BCαIle68A−1.63.442.53139.8°1apyO Met69ACαAla196B−2.03.232.40132.5°Adjacent α-helices in antiparallel orientation1whtOγSer349BCβHis183A−1.83.312.54125.1°1whtO Thr344BCαGly187A−0.73.842.95140.4°1whtO Gly187ACβThr344B−1.63.412.35157.7°Adjacent α-helices in quasi-vertical orientation1rypOɛ2Glu166KCβTyr137Z−1.23.662.71143.4°1rypOɛ2 Glu166KCαGly138Z−1.23.632.80131.3°1rypOɛ1 Glu166KCβAsp141Z−2.03.282.62117.5°1rypOδ2 Asp141ZCδLys169K−1.93.292.31146.4°2-a The pair energy is recalculated by the potentials.2-b d represents the interatomic C···O distance, i.e. the donor-acceptor distance of the CH···O hydrogen bond.2-c dH represents the H···O distance, i.e. the CH···O H-bond distance.2-d θ represents the C–H–O angle of the CH···O hydrogen bond.

Open table in a new tab Comparisons of Energy Minimization Calculations with and without Inclusion of the CH···O Hydrogen Bonding Interaction EnergiesModel of the Weak CH···O=C Hydrogen BondWe have modeled the weak CH···O=C hydrogen bond by adding a distance constraint, as shown in Equation 5,Econstraint={0.5*kmin*(rCαH···O−rmin)2 rCαH···O<rmin0.0rmin<rCαH···O<rmax0.5*kmax*(rCαH···O−rmax)2<rCαH···O>rmaxEquation 5 where k min = 200 kJ/(mol*Å2), k max = 100 kJ/(mol*Å2), r min = 3.2 Å, andr max = 3.4 Å. Because we could not generate realistic binding energies using van der Waals interactions and partial charge electrostatics, a distance constraint was used to forced(C···O) to take on the observed value of ∼3.2–3.4 Å to model the weak CH···O=C hydrogen bond. According to the potential shape of weak CH···O=C H-bonds, two different force constants of the constraint were used in the close or long distance range, respectively.The resultant weak CH···O=C interaction potential isE CαH···O =E electro + E VdW +E constraint, and the energy terms of van der Waals (E VdW) and electrostatic (E electro) interactions were calculated by the values taken from CHARMM (60Ho B.K. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The distance constraint was artificially stable and adequately simulated the van der Waals and partial interactions between the carbon and oxygen atoms in the weak CH···O=C hydrogen bond.Analysis of the Stereochemistry of the CH···O Hydrogen Bond Based on the Minimized Structures with and without Inclusion of the CH···O Hydrogen Bonding Interaction EnergiesThe crystal structures of the protein complexes served as the starting point. The initial hydrogen atoms were added to these Protein Data Bank coordinate files using CHARMM (60Ho B.K. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Two different strategies were adopted during the minimization process of CHARMM. In the first one, 2500 cycles of the conjugate gradient minimizer (CONJ) were used until the energy convergence; no atoms were fixed; and the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions were calculated as the non-bonded interactions of atom pairs during the minimization process. In the second one, 2500 cycles of conjugate gradient minimizer (CONJ) were also used until the energy convergence, and the distance constraint forcing the distance of the C···O pair was added to the interaction energies to model the weak CαH···O=C hydrogen bond. In all minimization calculations, the dielectric constant was simply set at 80 to simulate the water medium.The first strategy represents the energy minimization calculation without inclusion of the CH···O hydrogen bonding interaction energies, and the second one represents the energy minimization calculation with inclusion of the CH···O hydrogen bonding interaction energies. The crystal structure was used as the reference structure for the purpose of comparisons. The C···O distances of the CH···O hydrogen bonds in the different structures with and without inclusion of the CH···O hydrogen bonding interaction energies were calculated, and the shift of the C···O distance was analyzed.RESULTSHelmholtz Free Energy for General CH···O Hydrogen Bonding Intera"

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether mouse Slc26a6 can mediate one or more of the additional anion exchange processes observed to take place across the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells. Influx of [14C]formate into Slc26a6-expressing oocytes was inhibited by sulfate, oxalate, and p-aminohippurate (PAH), indicating affinity for these anions. Measurements of uptake of [14C]oxalate, [14C]PAH, and [35S]sulfate indicated that Slc26a6 can mediate transport of oxalate and sulfate but not PAH. Studies of the effect of external anions on [14C]oxalate efflux demonstrated Slc26a6-mediated Cl−-oxalate, oxalate-formate, oxalate-oxalate, and oxalate-sulfate exchange. Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements indicated that Slc26a6-mediated Cl−-oxalate exchange is electrogenic. Intracellular pH recordings demonstrated that Slc26a6 can mediate Cl−-HCO3− exchange, but Cl−-OH− exchange was not detected. The presence of 100 μm oxalate inhibited the rate of Cl−-HCO3− exchange by 60%. We conclude that mouse Slc26a6 has affinity for oxalate, sulfate, and HCO3− in addition to Cl− and formate and can function in multiple exchange modes involving pairs of these anions. In the presence of high oxalate concentrations as found in renal tubular fluid and urine, Slc26a6 may largely function as an electrogenic Cl−-oxalate exchanger.

Studies using isolated brush border vesicles and perfused tubules are consistent with the concept that a major fraction of Cl− entry across the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells occurs via Cl−-formate exchange and Cl−-oxalate exchange (1Aronson P.S. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F179-F192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular identification of the transporter(s) responsible for these anion exchange activities has yet to be established with certainty. Recently, CFEX, the mouse orthologue of human SLC26A6 (2Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkela E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestila M. Kere J. Genomics. 2000; 70: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Waldegger S. Moschen I. Ramirez A. Smith R.J. Ayadi H. Lang F. Kubisch C. Genomics. 2001; 72: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), was demonstrated to be capable of mediating Cl−-formate exchange when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and it was localized to the brush border membrane of proximal tubule cells by immunocytochemistry (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, Slc26a6 was proposed as a candidate to mediate Cl−-formate exchange in the proximal tubule (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to characterize the anion specificity of Slc26a6 in more detail and to test specifically the ability of Slc26a6 to mediate additional anion exchange processes known to take place across the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells, such as Cl−-oxalate exchange. We find that mouse Slc26a6 can mediate transport of oxalate, sulfate, and HCO3− in addition to Cl− and formate and can function in multiple exchange modes involving pairs of these anions, including Cl−-oxalate exchange. Mouse Slc26a6 (CFEX) cDNA was subcloned into the Xenopus expression plasmid pGH19 (5Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) and heterologously expressed in Xenopusoocytes as described previously (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the experiments in this study, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water (control) or Slc26a6 cRNA (25 ng), and transport was assayed 2 days later. For measurements of solute influx, oocytes were washed twice in 1 ml chloride-free buffer (98 mm potassium-gluconate/1.8 mmhemi-calcium-gluconate/1 mm hemi-magnesium-gluconate/5 mm Tris-Hepes, pH 7.5) and then incubated in 500 μl of uptake solution (100 mm potassium-gluconate/5 mm Tris, pH adjusted to 7.5 with Hepes) containing the radiolabeled solutes to be tested (36Cl, [14C]formate, [14C]oxalate, [35S]sulfate, [14C]PAH).1After 30-min incubation at room temperature, external isotope was removed by washing the oocytes three times with 1 ml of ice-cold chloride-free buffer. For efflux measurements, oocytes were first preloaded with radioisotope by incubating for 60 min in chloride-free buffer containing [14C]oxalate. After three washes in ice-cold chloride-free buffer, the radioisotope content of oocytes was measured both initially and 15 min after suspension in solution containing test anions. Net efflux was calculated as the difference between the initial oocyte radioisotope content and that remaining after 15-min reincubation. For experiments in which anions were tested for effects on radiolabeled solute influx or efflux, gluconate was isosmotically replaced by each test anion, and media were buffered with 5 mm Tris titrated with Hepes to pH 7.5. Radioisotope content of each individual oocyte was measured by scintillation spectroscopy after solubilization in 0.2 ml of 10% SDS and addition of 3 ml scintillation fluid (Opti-fluor, Packard). Results shown in the bar graphs represent means ± S.E. for 9–12 oocytes in each group. In some cases the S.E. values are too small to be visible in the figures. Membrane currents were measured using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp (model OC-725B Oocyte Clamp, Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT). As described previously (6Grichtchenko I.I. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 533-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cells were impaled with microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl (resistance = 0.3–1.0 mega-ohms) the holding potential (Vhold) was −60 mV, and currents were filtered at 20 Hz using a 4-pole Bessel filter. In separate experiments, microelectrodes were used to monitor intracellular pH and membrane voltage (7Grichtchenko I.I. Choi I. Zhong X. Bray-Ward P. Russell J.M. Boron W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8358-8363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The voltage- and pH-sensitive microelectrodes were prepared as described previously (8Siebens A.W. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 799-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pH electrode tip was filled with proton ionophore 1 mixture B (Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY), and back-filled with a pH 7 phosphate buffer (9Chao P. Ammann D. Oesch U. Simon W. Lang F. Pfluegers Arch. 1988; 411: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Electrodes were connected to high impedance electrometers (model FD-223; WPI, Inc., Sarasota, FL), the signal from the voltage microelectrode was subtracted electronically from the voltage of the pH electrode, and the amplified output of the subtraction circuitry was connected to the A-D converter of a computer. Oocytes were held in a chamber that was perfused at a rate of 3 ml/min. Recordings were made at room temperature (∼22 °C). The standard perfusion medium consisted of 93.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2.8 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm NaOH, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. Gluconate replaced Cl− in the Cl−-free medium. NaCl was isosmotically replaced by 10 mmNaHCO3 in the HCO3− medium, pH 7.5, which was gassed with 1.5% CO2. In some solutions, 16 mm NaCl was replaced with 16 mmn-butyric acid sodium salt (B-5887, Sigma). As an initial approach to examine the anion specificity of Slc26a6-mediated transport, we measured the uptake of 20 μm[14C]formate in the presence of 5 mm test anions added to the external medium. Illustrated in Fig.1, injection of mouse Slc26a6 (CFEX) cRNA strongly induced [14C]formate uptake intoXenopus oocytes compared with water-injected controls, as reported previously (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Inhibition of [14C]formate influx by Cl− and unlabeled formate also confirmed previous findings (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), consistent with the function of Slc26a6 as a Cl−-formate exchanger. However, as shown in Fig. 1, several additional anions inhibited [14C]formate uptake with potency greater than formate, including oxalate, PAH, and sulfate. Succinate caused modest but significant inhibition, while little or no interaction was detected with lactate. We had previously found the absence of inhibition by 10 mm acetate (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings in Fig. 1 suggested that Slc26a6 has affinity for multiple anions in addition to Cl− and formate and might therefore function in transport modes involving these additional anions. Accordingly, we directly tested the ability of Slc26a6 to mediate uptake of oxalate, PAH, and sulfate. In the experiment illustrated in Fig.2, 30-min uptake values of 20 μm [14C]formate, [14C]oxalate, [14C]PAH, and [35S]sulfate were compared in oocytes injected with Slc26a6 cRNA or water. The results confirmed that Slc26a6 is capable of transporting sulfate and oxalate in addition to formate. In contrast, although PAH was a strong inhibitor of Slc26a6-mediated formate uptake, we could not detect Slc26a6-mediated PAH transport. Interestingly, when tested at the same substrate concentration, uptake of oxalate was more than 2-fold greater than that of formate or sulfate, suggesting that Slc26a6 has greatest activity as an oxalate transporter under these conditions. All Slc26a6-mediated transport activities in Fig. 2 were abolished by the disulfonic stilbene DIDS (100 μm). To evaluate in more detail the relative affinities of oxalate, sulfate, and formate for interaction with Slc26a6, we tested the ability of each anion to inhibit uptake of 3 mm36Cl. As indicated in Fig. 3, 1 mm oxalate caused 40% inhibition of 36Cl uptake, whereas sulfate and formate failed to inhibit Cl− uptake under the same conditions. These findings demonstrated that among these anions oxalate has the highest affinity for interaction with Slc26a6. To estimate the apparent affinity for oxalate, we measured the influx of oxalate as a function of oxalate concentration. As shown by the Hanes-Woolf plot in Fig.4, the Km for oxalate was ∼300 μm. Because oxalate uptake into renal brush border membrane vesicles is stimulated by imposition of an outside-acid pH gradient, consistent with a process of H+-oxalate cotransport or oxalate-OH− exchange (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Slc26A6-mediated oxalate transport is similarly pH-sensitive. As indicated in Fig. 5, oxalate influx into Slc26a6-expressing oocytes was virtually identical at external pH values of 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5, arguing against significant H+-oxalate cotransport or oxalate-OH−exchange.Figure 5Effects of external pH on 30 min uptake of 20 μm[14C]oxalate. Uptake of oxalate into water-injected oocytes was measured at pH 7.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Having demonstrated that oxalate is a high affinity substrate for transport by Slc26a6, we next evaluated whether oxalate transport takes place by exchange for anions other than OH−. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, Slc26a6-expressing oocytes were preloaded with [14C]oxalate by preincubation for 60 min under the same conditions used to measure [14C]oxalate uptake in Fig. 2. The oocytes were then washed and resuspended in media containing 10 mm external test anions and reincubated for an additional 15 min. As shown in Fig.6, [14C]oxalate efflux was stimulated by external anions in the order Cl− > oxalate > formate > sulfate. Acetate, which was previously found to neither inhibit formate influx nor stimulate formate efflux (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), failed to stimulate [14C]oxalate efflux. These findings indicated that Slc26a6 is capable of functioning in Cl−-oxalate, oxalate-oxalate, oxalate-formate, and oxalate-sulfate exchange modes, with greatest activity as a Cl−-oxalate exchanger under the tested conditions. Previous studies found that oxalate transport via Cl−-oxalate exchange in renal brush border membrane vesicles is electrogenic, consistent with 1:1 exchange of divalent oxalate for monovalent Cl− (11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore performed voltage clamp experiments in Slc26a6-expressing Xenopus oocytes to test whether oxalate transport mediated by Slc26a6 is electrogenic. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 7, Cl− was removed from the external medium to impose an outward Cl− gradient. Under these conditions, addition of 5 mm oxalate to the external medium caused a large outward current, indicating net inward movement of negative charges associated with uptake of oxalate. The mean outward current induced by addition of 5 mm oxalate in three experiments was 810 ± 38 nA. This outward current gradually decayed and then returned to base line when external oxalate was removed. Readdition of external Cl− then caused a marked inward current, reflecting net outward movement of negative charge. The large inward current resulting from Cl− addition after cellular oxalate loading most likely represents electrogenic exchange of intracellular oxalate for external Cl−. The presence of 100 μm DIDS almost completely abolished the oxalate induced currents. Shown in theinset, oxalate failed to induce currents in water-injected oocytes. Thus, the results shown in Fig. 7 indicated that Cl−-oxalate exchange mediated by Slc26a6 is electrogenic. Recent experiments showed that removal of extracellular Cl− in the presence of CO2/HCO3− causes a rise in pHi in Slc26a6-expressing oocytes, indicating that Slc26a6 (PAT1) can mediate Cl−-OH− and/or Cl−-HCO3− exchange (12Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G573-G579Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We conducted a final series of experiments to evaluate the relative affinities of HCO3− and oxalate as exchange partners for Cl−. Intracellular pH was directly monitored with a pH-sensitive microelectrode in oocytes injected with Slc26a6 cRNA. As shown in Fig. 8A, isohydric, pH 7.5, replacement of Hepes-buffered external medium with a medium containing 10 mm HCO3−, 1.5% CO2resulted in intracellular acidification due to entry of CO2. In the presence of HCO3−, removal of external Cl− caused an intracellular alkalinization that was blocked by DIDS. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 8B, when intracellular pH was acidified in the absence of HCO3−/CO2 by addition of the weak acid anion butyrate to the external medium, Cl− removal failed to cause intracellular alkalinization. As shown in Fig. 8C, in the presence of HCO3−, Cl− removal failed to induce intracellular alkalinization in control water-injected oocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that Slc26a6 does indeed mediate Cl−-HCO3− exchange but does not mediate detectable Cl−-OH− exchange under similar conditions. To evaluate the relative affinities of HCO3− and oxalate as substrates to exchange for Cl−, the protocol for assaying Cl−-HCO3− exchange was repeated in the presence and absence of 100 μmoxalate. As illustrated in Fig. 9, 100 μm external oxalate greatly reduced the rate of exchange of intracellular Cl− for 10 mm external HCO3−, indicating that Slc26a6 has much greater affinity for oxalate than for HCO3−. In three experiments, 100 μm oxalate reduced the mean rate of pHi recovery by 60% from 4.27 ± 0.10 to 1.67 ± 0.11 × 10−4 pH units/s. This inhibition of the rate of pHi recovery was not due to the difference in starting pH because oxalate caused similar inhibition of pHi recovery (4.8versus 1.5 × 10−4 pH units/s) when the order of ion substitution was reversed (not shown). Fig. 9 also demonstrates the relatively large changes in membrane potential resulting from electrogenic oxalate transport. In three experiments, the mean hyperpolarization resulting from addition of 100 μm oxalate to the external solution in the absence of Cl− was 29.3 ± 0.4 mV, reflecting electrogenic oxalate influx. Removal of external oxalate and re-addition of Cl− caused a mean depolarization of 114.0 ± 3.6 mV in the three experiments, with a shift in the membrane potential to a peak of +58.7 ± 5.1 mV. This marked depolarization is consistent with electrogenic efflux of intracellular oxalate in exchange for external Cl−. In the present study we have shown that mouse Slc26a6 can mediate transport of oxalate, sulfate, and HCO3−, in addition to Cl− and formate, and can operate in multiple exchange modes involving pairs of these anions. These exchange modes include Cl−-oxalate and oxalate-sulfate exchange in addition to the previously described Cl−-formate exchange (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies have demonstrated the presence of Slc26a6 (CFEX) on the apical or brush border membrane of renal proximal tubule cells (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Microperfusion experiments have indicated that physiologic concentrations of formate and oxalate markedly stimulate Cl− and fluid absorption in the rat proximal convoluted tubule (13Schild L. Giebisch G. Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Am. J.

Physiol. 1995; 268: F847-F853PubMed Google Scholar) and that different mechanisms of anion recycling underlie the effects of formate and oxalate (17Wang T. Egbert A.L., Jr. Abbiati T. Aronson P.S. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F446-F450PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas evidence suggests that formate-stimulated NaCl uptake across the apical membrane arises from Cl−-formate exchange in parallel with Na+-H+ exchange and H+-coupled formate entry (17Wang T. Egbert A.L., Jr. Abbiati T. Aronson P.S. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F446-F450PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wang T. Yang C.L. Abbiati T. Shull G.E. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F288-F292PubMed Google Scholar), oxalate-induced transport appears to involve oxalate-Cl− exchange in parallel with sodium-sulfate cotransport and sulfate-oxalate exchange (17Wang T. Egbert A.L., Jr. Abbiati T. Aronson P.S. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F446-F450PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings clearly raise the possibility that the Cl−-formate, Cl−-oxalate, and oxalate-sulfate exchange activities necessary for proximal tubule NaCl absorption may all be mediated by Slc26a6. However, previous studies (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar, 19Aronson P.S. Kuo S.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 574: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) of anion transport in brush border vesicles strongly suggested the presence of at least three separate transporters mediating Cl−-formate, Cl−-oxalate, and oxalate-sulfate exchange. For example, although formate was found to be a substrate for the transporter mediating Cl−-oxalate exchange (11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar), the major fraction of Cl−-formate exchange was insensitive to competition by oxalate (11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that most Cl−-formate exchange is mediated by a pathway separate from that mediating Cl−-oxalate exchange. In addition, the major fraction of Cl−-formate exchange was only partially inhibited by concentrations of disulfonic stilbenes that abolished Cl−-oxalate exchange (11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar, 20McConnell K.R. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21489-21494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), further suggesting that most of the Cl−-formate exchange is mediated by a pathway separate from that mediating Cl−-oxalate exchange. Similarly, although a small activity of Cl−-sulfate exchange was observed (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar), the major fraction of oxalate-sulfate exchange was insensitive to competition by Cl− (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that most of the oxalate-sulfate exchange is mediated by a pathway separate from that mediating Cl−-oxalate exchange. The existence of separate apical membrane pathways mediating oxalate-sulfate exchange and Cl−-oxalate exchange is also supported by reconstitution experiments showing that these activities purified in different protein fractions from solubilized renal brush border membranes (21Karniski L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F189-F196PubMed Google Scholar). The present study indicates that mouse Slc26a6 has relatively high affinity for oxalate, Cl−, and disulfonic stilbenes and that Slc26a6 can mediate electrogenic Cl−-oxalate exchange. These features closely resemble the properties of the pathway found to mediate Cl−-oxalate exchange in renal brush border membrane vesicles (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar). But Slc26a6 is clearly capable of mediating Cl−-formate exchange and oxalate-sulfate exchange as well. How then can the present data be reconciled with previous findings indicating that at least three separate transporters mediate Cl−-formate, Cl−-oxalate, and oxalate-sulfate exchange in renal brush border membrane vesicles? One possibility is that additional transporter(s) yet to be identified rather than Slc26a6 mediate most of the Cl−-formate exchange and oxalate-sulfate exchange described in studies of renal brush border membrane vesicles. Another possibility is that Slc26a6 associates with additional subunits in native kidney membranes so as to form the three different anion exchange pathways characterized in previous kinetic studies. It should be noted that the previous studies of anion exchange in brush border membranes were conducted using rabbit kidneys (10Kuo S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15491-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Karniski L.P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F513-F521PubMed Google Scholar, 20McConnell K.R. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21489-21494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Karniski L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F189-F196PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a third possibility is that Slc26a6 accounts for all three anion exchange activities in mouse kidney, whereas additional transporters are involved in rabbit. Finally, we confirmed the previous observation that removal of external Cl− alkalinizes Slc26a6-expressing oocytes (12Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J.

In addition, we found that this effect of Cl− removal was HCO3−-dependent, indicating that Slc26a6 can mediate Cl−-HCO3− exchange but not significant Cl−-OH− exchange. The inability of Slc26a6 to mediate significant Cl−-OH−exchange is also supported by the previous finding that Cl− uptake into Slc26a6-expressing oocytes was not stimulated by acidification of the external medium in the absence of HCO3− (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Data concerning the presence of Cl−-OH− exchange activity in renal brush border membrane vesicles has been conflicting (22Warnock D.G. Yee V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Seifter J.L. Knickelbein R. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: F753-F759PubMed Google Scholar), but if appreciable Cl−-OH− exchange activity does occur physiologically, the present study suggests it must be mediated by a pathway other than Slc26a6. Similarly, the inability of Slc26a6 to facilitate PAH transport indicates that the anion exchange process that transports PAH and urate in renal brush border vesicles (24Blomstedt J.W. Aronson P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Kahn A.M. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F56-F63PubMed Google Scholar, 26Guggino S.E. Martin G.J. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 244: F612-F621PubMed Google Scholar) must also be mediated by a pathway other than Slc26a6. In our initial characterization of Cl− transport mediated by Slc26a6, we found that Cl− influx was inhibited by external HCO3−, as expected for Cl−-HCO3− exchange, but Cl− efflux was only modestly and not significantly stimulated by external HCO3− (4Knauf F. Yang C.L. Thomson R.B. Mentone S.A. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There are at least two possible explanations for the failure to detect Cl−-HCO3− exchange in the earlier study. First, the use of a relatively late time point at which almost 50% of the intracellular Cl− content had already been lost may have reduced the sensitivity for detecting stimulation of Cl− efflux. Second, as shown in Fig. 8 of the present study, exposure to CO2 causes significant intracellular acidification. Oocytes were not gassed with CO2 in the earlier study. If intracellular acidification stimulates the rate of Cl−-HCO3− exchange mediated by Slc26a6, then the conditions of the prior study may not have been optimal for detection of this transport activity. Measurements of intracellular pH have indicated that Cl−-HCO3− exchange activity is present on the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells (16Sheu J.N. Quigley R. Baum M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F847-F853PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kurtz I. Nagami G. Yanagawa N., Li, L. Emmons C. Lee I. J. Clin.

Physiol. 1995; 268: F847-F853PubMed Google Scholar). The present and previous (12Wang Z. Petrovic S. Mann E. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G573-G579Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) findings suggest that Slc26a6 may account for this transport activity. However, we observed that a concentration of oxalate in the range found in renal tubular fluid and urine (100 μm) can significantly convert the function of Slc26a6 from Cl−-HCO3− exchange to Cl−-oxalate exchange. Accordingly, it is possible that in cells physiologically exposed to appreciable oxalate concentrations, as in the kidney, Slc26a6 may predominantly function as a Cl−-oxalate exchanger, whereas in the absence of such high oxalate concentrations, Slc26a6 may principally mediate Cl−-HCO3− exchange. It should be noted that Slc26a6 is expressed in a wide range of epithelial and non-epithelial tissues (2Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkela E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestila M. Kere J.

Transcription factor genes of the homeobox, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and zinc-finger families have recently been shown to have essential roles in this process. However, the actual selector genes activating corticogenesis have not yet been identified. Here we show that high-level expression of at least one functional allele of either of the homeobox genes Emx2 or Pax6 in the dorsal telencephalon is necessary and sufficient to stably activate morphogenesis of cerebral cortex and to repress that of adjacent structures, such as striatum."

In contrast, MG132 showed no suppressive effect on glucocorticoid receptor transactivation. Additionally, transfection of PSMA7, a proteasome subunit, enhanced AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. The suppression of AR transactivation by MG132 may then result in the suppression of prostate-specific antigen, a well known marker used to monitor the progress of prostate cancer.

The 19 S complexes are responsible for recognition of the polyubiquitinated protein substrates and work to bridge the substrates to the 20 S core complex for degradation. The barrel-shaped 20 S complex contains four rings, each of which is made up of seven different subunits. The two outer rings contain α-type subunits, whereas the inner rings contain β-type subunits (4Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L.

The protein ubiquitination is initiated by multiple enzyme reactions catalyzed by a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a few ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s),1 and a large variety of ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). The intrinsic E3 ligase activity represents the rate limiting step of ubiquitin modification of proteins. Therefore, the control of the E3 ligase activity may influence proteasome-dependent protein degradation (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev.

The proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, suppress the inflammatory response by blocking NF-κB activation or induction of heat shock protein expression, which may allow cells to resist higher temperatures and other toxic agents as well as prevent leukemia cell apoptosis (13Lee D.H.

In contrast, proteasome inhibitors can also induce cancer cell apoptosis, accompanied by activation of several caspases, such as caspase-3 or caspase-7 (16Wagenknecht B. Hermisson M. Groscurth P.

Although apoptosis elicited by proteasome inhibitors is universal and not restricted to only one cancer cell type, the molecular mechanisms by which the proteasome inhibitors induce apoptosis remain largely unknown.

Early evidence suggested that the ubiquitin-proteasome system might be involved in the regulation of AR protein turnover (26Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). For example, UBC9, an E2 enzyme, can bind to AR and enhance AR transactivation (27Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Karvonen U. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19441-19446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A putative PEST sequence located in the hinge region of AR is also proposed to play important roles in ubiquitination-related AR degradation (26Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results imply that the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be involved in the regulation of AR activity. Here we have demonstrated that inhibition of the proteasome suppresses AR transactivation, AR nuclear translocation, and interaction between AR and AR coregulators, whereas proteasome subunits enhance AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the proteasome system is required for AR activity.

The human prostate cancer PC-3 cells and African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 5% fetal calf serum. The human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using SuperFect™ according to standard procedures (Qiagen). LNCaP cells were treated with 40 μm Z-VAD-fmk 30 min prior to 5 μm MG132 treatment. After 48 h, the cells were harvested for the TUNEL assay to measure cell apoptosis according to standard procedures (Oncogene Research Products). At least 200 cells were scored for each sample, and the data are means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The cells were transfected with pSG5-AR along with vector or PSMA7 and the mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase (MMTV-luc) reporter for 16 h and then treated with ethanol or 10 nm DHT for another 16 h. The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was detected by the dual luciferase assay using pRL-SV40 as an internal control, according to standard procedures. Each sample was normalized by pRL-SV40, and data are means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. The nuclear and cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (28Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Briefly, LNCaP cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO, or 5 μm MG132 for 30 min prior to 10 nm DHT treatment. After 8 h of treatment, the cells were dissolved in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min and then centrifuged for 30 s. The supernatant was collected as a cytosolic fraction. The pellets were dissolved in buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min and centrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant was then collected as a nuclear fraction. Western blotting was performed as previously described (29Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were transfected with pSG5-AR for 16 h, followed by treatment with Me2SO or 5 μm MG132 for 30 min prior to addition of 10 nm DHT. After 16 h of treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min on ice; the cells were then permeabilized with 100% methanol for 15 min on ice. The following experiments were performed at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The primary antibody against AR (NH27) was added for 1 h, and cells were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline. The secondary antibody was added for 1 h, and cells were then washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by application of the counting medium containing 4,6-diaminodino-2-phenylinodel (DAPI). A Texas Red anti-rabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Coverslips were examined with a confocal microscope. Androgen/AR signaling plays important roles in prostate cancer cell growth and cell apoptosis (29Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Groscurth P. Liston P. Krammer P.H. Weller M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2288-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Qiu J.H. Asai A. Chi S. Saito N. Hamada H. Kirino T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that MG132 (5 μm) could markedly induce apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCaP cells (Fig. 1). The MG132-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells was dramatically reduced by Z-VAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, suggesting that MG132-induced apoptosis is, at least in part, achieved through a caspase-dependent pathway (Fig. 1). To study the potential linkage between MG132-induced cell apoptosis and androgen/AR signaling, the AR transactivation assay was performed using three AR reporters including MMTV-luc, prostate specific-antigen (PSA)-luc, and four copies of a synthetic androgen response element, (ARE)4-luc, in the presence or absence of MG132. As shown in Fig. 2 A, 10 nm DHT activated the three AR reporters markedly, and addition of 5 μm MG132 dramatically suppressed the DHT-induced AR transactivation of all three AR reporters in LNCaP cells. Similar results were obtained in PC-3 cells, an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line transfected with wild-type AR (Fig. 2 B), as well as in COS-1 cells that were transfected with wild-type AR (data not shown). To determine whether MG132 affects steroid receptor transactivation in general, we used the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) for comparison. As shown in Fig.2 C, MG132 did not suppress dexamethasone (Dex)-induced GR transactivation. Suppression of AR transactivation by MG132 seems to occur upstream of its apoptotic activity, because the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, which blocked MG132-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1), did not affect the MG132-mediated suppression of AR transactivation (Fig.2 D). This result suggests that suppression of AR transactivation by MG132 is not an effect secondary to its induction of apoptosis. To rule out the possibility that the suppressive effect on AR transactivation by proteasome inhibition is mediated only through MG132 activity, we used another proteasome inhibitor, lactacystine, in our reporter study. Lactacystine, like MG132, suppressed AR transactivation of all three AR reporter constructs (Fig.3 A) and did not suppress GR transactivation (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results suggest that proteasome activity is important for AR transcriptional activation.Figure 2The proteasome activity is required for AR transactivation but not for GR transactivation.

To test this hypothesis, we transfected PSMA7, an α-type subunit of the 20 S proteasome core complex (33Cho S. Choi Y.J. Kim J.M. Jeong S.T. Kim J.H. Kim S.H. Ryu S.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), into PC-3 cells in combination with AR and the MMTV-luc reporter. As shown in Fig. 3 C, 10 nm DHT induced AR transactivation up to 10-fold, and addition of PSMA7 further enhanced androgen-mediated AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Together, results from Figs. 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that the proteasome has an important role in modulation of AR transactivation. To reduce the potential artifactual effects of reporter assays, we applied Northern and Western blot analyses of LNCaP cells to assess the MG132 effect on the expression of PSA, an endogenous AR target gene. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, 10 nm DHT induced PSA expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and addition of 5 μm MG132 then repressed this effect, suggesting that proteasome activity is important for expression of endogenous AR target genes. It should be noted that MG132 also suppressed the basal PSA expression without androgen treatment (Fig.4 A), suggesting that very small amounts of androgen in the medium may contribute to induction of PSA expression, an effect that could be inhibited by MG132. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that MG132 may also suppress PSA expression via an androgen-independent pathway. Interestingly, when we compared AR expression in the presence or absence of MG132, the results (Fig.4 C) demonstrated that MG132 treatment for 6 h could increase AR protein expression in the absence of DHT, whereas after MG132 treatment for 24 h AR protein levels were suppressed in the absence of DHT. However, MG132 showed only a marginal effect on AR protein levels in the presence of DHT (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that reduction of AR protein expression may not play a major role in the MG132-mediated suppression of androgen-induced PSA expression. Although MG132 decreased AR protein levels in the absence of DHT, it did not affect the expression of β-actin (Fig. 4) or Akt, a survival protein (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that MG132 does not have a general toxic effect on cells. Because the AR hinge domain contains a putative PEST sequence that overlaps the bipartite nuclear localization signal, it is possible that MG132 may reduce AR transactivation via interruption of AR nuclear translocation. To test this hypothesis, we used immunocytochemistry to monitor AR nuclear translocation in COS-1 cells, a well studied cell model in which androgen-dependent AR nuclear translocation has been demonstrated. As shown in Fig.5 A, AR was mainly expressed in the cytosol in the absence of androgen, and the addition of 10 nm DHT resulted in translocation of most of the cytosolic AR into the nucleus (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, addition of 5 μm MG132 significantly suppressed (near 50%) AR nuclear translocation (Fig. 5, A and B). As a control, MG132 showed little influence on GR nuclear translocation (Fig. 5,C and D). To further confirm the effect of MG132 on AR nuclear translocation, we prepared cytosolic and nuclear fractions for Western blot assay. LNCaP cells were treated with 5 μm MG132 30 min prior to addition of 10 nm DHT. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were then collected. In Fig. 6, Western blot analysis using the NH27 anti-AR antibody demonstrates that DHT increases AR protein expression in the nucleus and that MG132 significantly reduces AR protein expression in the nucleus. In contrast, MG132 enhances AR protein expression in the cytosol, suggesting that MG132 suppresses androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation. Together, results from Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that MG132 suppresses AR transactivation via interruption of AR nuclear translocation.Figure 6MG132 suppresses AR nuclear translocation. LNCaP cells were treated with 5 μmMG132 30 min prior to 10 nm DHT treatment. After 8 h, the cells were harvested for preparation of cytosolic and nuclear fractions, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A recent report suggested that the proteasome system may also have steroid receptor coregulator-like activity and thus modulate steroid receptor transactivation as well as affect the stability of some coregulators (34Lonard D.M.

It is known that androgen-AR may cooperate with various coregulators to modulate their target genes for proper or maximal function (18Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr.

It is therefore possible that MG132 suppresses AR transactivation via interruption of AR coregulator function. To test this hypothesis, we applied the mammalian two-hybrid system to monitor the MG132 effect on the interaction between AR and its coregulators. As shown in Fig.7 A, 10 nm DHT induced interaction between AR and ARA70, and addition of MG132 significantly blocked this interaction. MG132 did not suppress the basal activity of the reporter gene in the absence of androgen. Similar suppressive effects also occurred when we replaced ARA70 with another AR coregulator, TIF2 (Fig. 7 B). Results shown in Fig. 7suggest that MG132 suppresses AR transactivation via interruption of interaction between AR and AR coregulators. Recent advances in the nuclear receptor field have indicated that steroid receptor transactivation is regulated by post-translational modification such as methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation (21Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar,29Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20853-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 dramatically attenuated AR transactivation in prostate cancer PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Northern and Western blot assays further confirmed this result, suggesting that the proteasome is an essential component for AR transcriptional activation and may serve as an AR coregulator. Overexpression of a 20 S proteasome subunit, PSMA7, enhanced AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C), providing evidence that the proteasome may act as a coregulator. Thus, the ubiquitin-proteasome system may represent another mechanism through which AR transactivation is regulated. The PEST sequence within the AR hinge domain, which is conserved throughout many species, may play a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (36Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). An early report demonstrated that AR protein expression in LNCaP cells could be increased after adding the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 4 h (26Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, we also observed a moderate increase of AR protein expression after short term (4–6 h) treatment with MG132 in LNCaP cells (Fig.4 C). However, long term treatment with MG132 (≥ 24 h) caused AR protein expression to decrease (Fig. 4, B andC) in the absence of androgen, which correlates with the finding that AR mRNA also decreases with long term treatment (data not shown). A potential explanation for this biphasic modulation of AR expression by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 is the combination effect, which entails suppression of AR mRNA expression yet prevention of AR protein degradation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the proteasome not only plays a proteolytic role in protein degradation but also plays a non-proteolytic role in transcription elongation, nuclear excision repair, and protein trafficking (1Pickart C.M.

Our results demonstrating that inhibition of proteasome function by MG132 attenuates androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation further support the non-proteolytic role of the proteasome in protein trafficking (1Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 37Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

In contrast, proteasome inhibition does not affect Dex-induced GR nuclear translocation, suggesting that the proteasome is not involved in modification of GR cellular localization. How the proteasome is involved in regulation of AR nuclear translocation is currently unknown. Since the PEST sequence in the AR hinge region overlaps the bipartite nuclear translocation region (19Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), it is possible that ubiquitination of AR in this region may provide the recognition site for proteasome association, resulting in the modulation of AR nuclear translocation. To support the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in AR nuclear translocation, it has been shown that the Snurf1 coregulator, a RING finger protein, could bind to the AR hinge region to enhance AR transactivation via promotion of AR nuclear translocation (19Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Poukka H. Aarnisalo P. Santti H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether Snurf1 has intrinsic E3 ligase activity to ubiquitinate AR and allow proteasome recognition and thus promotion of AR nuclear translocation. Upon binding to androgen, AR dissociates from the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and translocates into the nucleus. This process may require cooperation with many other coregulators, either in the cytosol or the nucleus (19Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hsiao P.W. Lin D.L. Nakao R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20229-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Any interruption of the interaction between AR and these coregulators may then alter AR function and result in abnormal androgen action. Our findings that MG132 can interrupt the interaction between AR and these coregulators, such as ARA70 and TIF2 (Fig. 7), further support the concept that both coregulators and the proteasome system are important for the regulation of AR function. The detailed mechanism of how the proteasome regulates AR activity is currently unclear. Based on our results and those of others, it is possible that the regulation of AR transcriptional activity by the proteasome may involve multiple mechanisms. First, proteasome inhibition can markedly suppress androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation (Figs. 5 and 6). As a result, AR access to the DNA in the nucleus decreases, leading to a reduction in AR transactivation. Second, proteasome inhibition interrupts the interaction of AR with its coregulators, such as ARA70 and TIF2 (Fig. 7). Recent reports indicate that AR coregulators play a key role in the regulation of AR transcriptional activity (18Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 19Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. J.

Supporting evidence has been provided by an additional study (44Miyamoto H. Rahman M. Takatera H. Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Chang H.C. Nishimura K. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4609-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of the dominant negative ARA54, an AR coregulator, suppresses AR transactivation, presumably via interruption of endogenous ARA54 association and function. Furthermore, addition of Pyk2, an ARA55-interacting protein, into PC-3(AR)2 cells could suppress AR transactivation by preventing the interaction between AR and ARA55 (45Wang X. Yang Y. Guo X. Sampson E.R. Hsu C.L. Tsai M.Y. Yeh S., Wu, G. Guo Y. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15426-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, abrogation of the interaction between AR and its coregulators by proteasome inhibition may result in suppression of AR transactivation. Third, it is possible that AR could be initially ubiquitinated by some unknown E3 ligases, providing the recognition site for proteasome association with AR. This association may then promote recruitment of individual coregulators to the AR complex, allowing proper androgen action. Fourth, it is also possible that the proteasome serves as a bridging factor to recruit transcriptional elongation factors to the AR complex. This assertion is supported by the recent report showing that the 19 S proteasome is required for efficient transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II via physical interaction with CDC69, an elongation factor (39Ferdous A. Gonzalez F. Sun L. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 981-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Finally, the proteasome may be recruited to the promoter region of AR target genes, where it could then facilitate AR transcriptional activation. In support of this idea, it has been shown that upon induction with galactose the 19 S proteasome is recruited to the GAL1–10 promoter in yeast via chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (46Gonzalez F. Delahodde A. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Proteasome inhibitors may interrupt proteasome binding to the promoter region of AR target genes, resulting in suppression of AR transactivation. Whether the proteasome is able to bind to the promoter region of AR target genes upon androgen treatment remains for further investigation. Although the PEST sequence, located in the hinge region of AR, is thought to be involved in ubiquitin proteasome-dependent protein degradation, an AR with a PEST sequence mutation with the lysine at position 638 replaced by arginine shows similar levels of transactivation as the wild-type AR when treated with androgen (data not shown). This result suggests that the PEST sequence may not be involved in AR transcriptional activity or affect protein stability. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that mutations at other positions in the PEST sequence affect AR protein stability and transactivation. Alternatively, the PEST sequence may still be involved in regulation of AR protein stability but not be involved in AR transactivation, because suppression of AR transactivation by MG132 is not via modulation of AR protein levels. In summary, our data demonstrate for the first time that the proteasome system plays an essential role in modulation of AR transcriptional activity via regulation of AR nuclear translocation and mediation of the interaction of AR with its coregulators. Because androgen/AR signals play essential roles in prostate cancer growth, any new mechanisms successful in blocking this growth could provide new targets for the design of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. Thus the proteasome system, which is required for optimal AR activity, may serve as such a therapeutic target. We thank Dr. S. Cho for reagents and K. Wolf for help in preparing the manuscript.

In this study, a 90 kDa protein (p90), auto-antibodies to which were found associated with anti-p62 responses in the same HCC patient group, was identified by cDNA expression cloning. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that, like p62, p90 localized to the cytoplasm in cultured cells and mouse fetal, but not adult liver. Among 11 human gastric cancer tissues examined, p90 was overexpressed in six (55%). Together with other cancer associated auto-antibodies such as anti-p53, anti-p62, anti-Koc, and anti-CENP-F, auto-antibodies to p90 represent a new marker for tumors such as HCC and gastric cancer. Our data support the working hypothesis that auto-antibody production in cancer may be directly linked to aberrant auto-antigen expression."
https://openalex.org/W1989528843,"In classical Hodgkin lymphoma the malignant Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells characteristically constitute only a small minority of the tumour load. Their origin has been debated for decades, but on the basis of rearrangement and somatic hypermutations of their immunoglubulin (Ig) genes, HRS cells are now ascribed to the B-cell lineage. Nevertheless, phenotypically HRS cells have lost their B cell identity: they usually lack common B cell-specific surface markers such as CD19 and CD79a as well as Ig gene transcripts. Here we demonstrate that Ig promoters as well as both intronic and 3′ enhancer sequences are transcriptionally inactive in HRS cell lines. This inactivity correlates with either reduced levels or even a complete lack of several B cell-specific transcription factors required for their expression: Oct-2, OBF-1, PU.1, E47/E12, PAX-5 and EBF. Moreover, we demonstrate that PU.1 and PAX-5 are significantly down-regulated in HRS cells in pathological specimens from primary tumour tissues. However, forced expression of these transcription factors can activate regulatory sequences of silenced B cell marker genes, and in one instance also transcription from a silenced endogenous locus. Thus, HRS cells are dedifferentiated B cells with global down-regulation of B cell-specific genes."

This phenotype suggests a possible role for the Fanconi anemia proteins in the repair of DNA lesions induced by these agents, but the molecular mechanism underlying the defect in this disorder has not yet been identified. Here, we show that amongst eight so far identified complementation groups of Fanconi anemia, only fibroblasts derived from group D1 are defective in the formation of nuclear Rad51 foci after X-ray irradiation or mitomycin C treatment. This indicates that the FANCD1 gene product is uniquely involved in the assembly and/or stabilization of the Rad51 complex. Since DNA damage-induced Rad51 nuclear foci are thought to reflect repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination, our results suggest that FANCD1 is likely to be involved in homologous recombination-dependent repair."

Unlike mice with HRG1 or isoform specific HRGβ gene deletions, HRGα-null mice survive to adulthood. HRGα-deficient mice display pronounced defects in mammary gland lobuloalveolar development at 17 days of pregnancy and 3 days post-partum. Terminal and lateral ductal alveoli were condensed and alveolar outgrowth during pregnancy was severely impaired. A dramatic reduction in β-casein expression accompanied defective alveolar development in the HRGα-null mice, as determined by in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis of HRGα-deficient mammary glands at 3 days post-partum. Expression of the milk-protein genes WAP and α-lactalbumin was not adversely affected. In situ incorporation of BrdU demonstrated that epithelial proliferation was significantly curtailed in mammary glands of HRGα-deficient mice at 17 days post-coitus and 3 days post-partum.

In a typical Escherichia coli cell, several thousand receptors are organized together with CheA and an Src homology 3-like protein, CheW, into complexes that tend to be localized at the cell poles. We found that these complexes have at least 6 receptors per CheA. CheW is not required for CheA binding to receptors, but is essential for kinase activation. The kinase activity per mole of bound CheA is proportional to the total bound CheW. Similar results were obtained with the E. coli serine receptor, Tsr, and theSalmonella typhimurium aspartate receptor, Tar. In the case of Tsr, under conditions optimal for kinase activation, the ratio of subunits in complexes is ∼6 Tsr:4 CheW:1 CheA. Our results indicate that information from numerous receptors is integrated to control the activity of a relatively small number of kinase molecules."

Binding of a repellent or attractant molecule to the periplasmic sensing domain of a receptor results in modulation of the activity of the histidine protein kinase, CheA, which together with an auxiliary protein, CheW, forms a complex with the cytoplasmic part of the receptors. CheA phosphorylates itself at a specific histidine residue, and the phosphoryl group is then transferred to an aspartate residue in the chemotaxis response regulator protein, CheY. Phosphorylated CheY binds to the flagellar motor complex where it induces a change in the direction the bacterium is swimming. Binding of an attractant to a receptor inhibits CheA (9Borkovich K.A.

The histidine-aspartate phosphorelay system that functions to transduce signals from the receptors to the motor is modulated by a unique carboxyl methylation system, which allows bacteria to sense gradients of repellents and attractants rather then their absolute levels. This ability depends on an adaptation system composed of two additional enzymes: an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase, CheR (12Djordjevic S. Stock A.M.

The glutamate and glutamine residues in Tsr that are subject to these modifications are Gln297, Glu304, Gln311, Glu493, and Glu502 (17Rice M.S. Dahlquist F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9746-9753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attractants induce increases in methylation that feed back to counteract attractant-induced kinase inhibition, and repellents cause decreases in methylation and amidation that feed back to inhibit repellent-induced kinase activity (18Ninfa E.G. Stock A. Mowbray S. Stock J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9764-9770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The net result is that CheR and CheB act to maintain the receptor signaling system in a balanced steady state that is adapted to the surrounding medium (20Springer M.S. Goy M.F. Adler J. Nature. 1979; 280: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Barkai N. Leibler S. Nature. 1997; 387: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which changes in receptor methylation and amidation allow cells to adapt to a broad range of attractant concentrations remains a controversial topic. A plausible model suggests that the adaptation occurs due to the changes in the receptor binding affinities resulting from changes in the glutamyl modification status,i.e. increases in the methylation cause decreases in the affinity for an attractant, and conversely, decreases in methylation cause increases in the affinity. However, studies of aspartate and serine binding to isolated receptors with defined levels of glutamyl modification that provided estimates of the K dvalues involved indicated that the dependence of the affinity on the methylation status is rather modest (19Borkovich K.A.

To explain this discrepancy, it has been proposed that the changes in ligand binding affinity only occur when receptors are in complexes, coupled to CheW and CheA (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, in parallel experiments we have measured both serine binding to the Tsr·CheW·CheA complexes and the effect of serine on the kinase activity of the complexes at different levels of glutamate modification. We show that the receptor modifications cause adaptation by changing the gain between attractant binding and kinase inhibition without substantially affecting the ligand binding affinity of the receptors and the level of kinase activity in the complexes.

Inner membranes containing the Tsr receptor were prepared according to the protocols (31Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W.

Unless stated otherwise, all concentrations are expressed in terms of the indicated monomeric species. To form the complexes, 5 μm Tsr in membranes (Preparation I (33Levit M.N. Grebe T.W. Stock J.B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. The ratio of components in the formed complexes was ∼6 Tsr:4 CheW:1 CheA (33Levit M.N. Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 5.0 μm CheR plus 200 μm S-adenosylmethionine or 5.0 μm CheBc were present in the incubation mixture during the complex formation. Steady-state activity of CheA in a complex with Tsr and CheW was measured using the spectroscopic pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay in the presence of 50 μm CheY and 2.0 mm ATP as described previously (34Surette M.G. Levit M. Liu Y. Lukat G. Ninfa E.G. Ninfa A. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The preformed Tsr·CheW·CheA complex was diluted 1:40 in Buffer A containing indicated concentrations of serine. The rate of the reaction measured in the presence of 4.0 mmserine was subtracted as a background (less than 25% of total). The same background rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined in the absence of CheY. l-Serine (Aldrich S260-0) and l-[3H]serine (Amersham Biosciences TRK308 or Moravek Biochemicals MT-910) were used to prepare 5× solutions with a range of serine concentrations (600 cpm/pmol) in Buffer A. Half of the solutions also contained extra 20 mmunlabeled serine. 5.0 μl of these solutions were added to 20 μl of Buffer A containing 5.0 μm Tsr or the complex preformed by incubation of 5.0 μm Tsr with 20 μm CheW and 10 μm CheA. Two parallel experiments were conducted, ± 4 mm (final) of the unlabeled serine. After 20-min incubation at 22 °C the mixtures were centrifuged for 5.0 min at 12,000 × g at room temperature. The supernatants were removed, the pellets were dissolved in the SDS-sample buffer, and the amounts of radioactivity in the pellets counted. Concentrations of the receptor-bound serine were computed as difference of the amounts of radioactivity in the pellets obtained in these two experiments. Tsr receptors alone or in complexes with CheW and CheA were incubated with3H-labeled serine and separated from the solution by centrifugation. The amounts of radioactivity in the membrane pellets were quantitated to determine ligand binding. At saturation, the serine bound per mole of Tsr subunits was 0.44 ± 0.11 (mean ± S.D. of seven experiments with three different membrane preparations), which is entirely consistent with previous results showing that E. coli Tsr and Tar receptor dimers can only bind one molecule of ligand at a time (23Lin L.N., Li, J. Brandts J.F. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6564-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 35Biemann H.P. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). No deviation from linearity was observed in a Scatchard plot of the data (Fig. 1). The same serine/Tsr ratio at saturation (0.43 ± 0.06; mean ± S.D. of four experiments with two different membrane preparations) was achieved when the Tsr receptor was in the complex with CheW and CheA. The ability of more than 85% of the periplasmic domains of Tsr dimers bind serine is consistent with the fact that kinase activity in the Tsr·CheW·CheA complexes was completely inhibited in the presence of saturating concentrations of serine (see below). The binding affinity of Tsr alone (K d = 10 ± 2 μm) was similar to that of Tsr in complexes with CheW and CheA (K d = 14 ± 1 μm) (Fig.2). Thus, formation of a complex with CheW and CheA does not significantly affect the affinity of Tsr for serine.Figure 2Dependence of the Tsr receptor occupancy on the serine concentration. Serine binding to the Tsr receptor alone (⋄) and to the Tsr·CheW·CheA complexes (○) formed by incubation of the mixture of 5.0 μm Tsr, 20 μm CheW, and 10 μm CheA (see “Experimental Procedures”) is shown. Serine binding showed a hyperbolic dependence on serine concentration with the level of receptor occupancy (a ratio between the ligand-bound and total receptor concentrations) being equal to [serinefree]/(K d + [Serinefree]). Concentration of the free serine, [serinefree], was calculated as a difference between the total serine concentration (ordinate) and concentration of the receptor-bound serine; curve fitting was conducted using the table function of the KaleidaGraph program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In parallel with studies of serine binding, the effects of serine on kinase activity were investigated. Surprisingly, the concentration of serine that caused 50% kinase inhibition (IC50 = 50 μm) was 4-fold greater than the concentration required for the 50% receptor occupancy (K d = 14 μm) (Fig.3). This result does not fit any simple linear relationship between serine receptor occupancy and kinase inhibition. The kinase activity of the complex formed by the Tsr receptor, CheW, and CheA is relatively insensitive to inhibition by subsaturating concentrations of bound ligand. Moreover, the inhibition data indicate only a slight degree of cooperativity between receptors, with a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (Fig.4).Figure 4Hill plot for the inhibitory effect of serine on kinase activity of the Tsr·CheW·CheA complex. Kinase inhibition data presented in Fig. 3 are plotted in the Hill coordinates, where V 0 is the kinase activity in the absence of serine, and v is the activity in the presence of the indicated concentrations of serine. Kinase activity was measured using the spectrophotometric coupled assay (see “Experimental Procedures”); identical results were obtained using the assay where release of 32Pi was measured using the thin layer chromatography assay (33Levit M.N.

A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports, in our experiments serine caused an increase in the level of Tsr methylation, especially when the receptors were associated with CheW and CheA (Fig.5). The small but significant effect of CheW and CheA on the efficiency of receptor methylation suggests that the interaction with CheR is regulated by complex formation. This may explain the relatively small increases in methylation that have previously been observed in response to attractants with isolated receptors in membranes (36Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1991; 254: 1651-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that methylation-induced adaptation to attractants results from lowering of the ligand binding affinity of the receptors (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we paralleled our investigation of the serine-induced inhibition of CheA activity in the Tsr·CheW·CheA complexes with direct studies of ligand binding to these complexes. The Tsr protein used in the studies described above was not modified, because it was expressed in a strain that lacks CheR and CheB. We have examined the effect of methylation and deamidation on receptor signaling complexes by treating receptor signaling complexes formed from these membranes with CheR + S-adenosylmethionine or with the catalytic domain of CheB, CheBc. Neither methylation nor deamidation had any effect on the stoichiometry of CheA or CheW binding to Tsr in membranes (31Gegner J.A. Graham D.R. Roth A.F. Dahlquist F.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 975-982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 33Levit M.N. Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that deamidation of a soluble receptor construct, lzTarC, precludes it from forming active complexes with CheA and CheW (37Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Presumably this results from electrostatic interactions associated with the assembly of soluble receptor subunits together into a compact barrel-like structure (38Francis N.R. Levit M.N. Shaikh T.R. Melanson L.A. Stock J.B. DeRosier D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36755-36759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated receptors are already localized in close approximation to one another, and under these conditions the process of assembly and complex stability are much less sensitive to a range of variables including subunit concentrations and buffer characteristics as well as the state of receptor modification. In the membrane, increases in receptor methylation did not affect the kinase activity of the complexes in the absence of serine. In previous studies with mutant receptors where glutamines were encoded in place of methyl-accepting glutamates (all Gln form) or with receptors expressed in CheR+CheB− mutant straines, 2–3-fold higher kinase activities were obtained compared with the activity of complexes formed with wild type, QEQE, receptors (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 19Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 693-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The previous experiments differ from the experiments reported here, however, insofar as they involved the use of membrane preparations from different overproducing strains, with the assumption that levels of receptor and bound CheA and CheW were the same. It is possible, therefore, that the relatively slight differences in kinase activity were due, at least in part, to differences between membrane preparations or to differences between the methylated and the mutant, all Gln receptor. On the other hand, decrease in the level of Tsr amidation resulting from incubation with 5.0 μm CheBc led to a 50% reduction in kinase activity in our experiments, in line with the previous observations (19Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (10Li G. Weis R.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9486-9493Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we found that elevated levels of methylation substantially increased the concentrations of serine required to inhibit kinase activity (IC50 ≈230 μm; Fig. 6). The affinity of Tsr in the complexes was hardly affected by methylation, however (K d = 19 ± 4 μm). Thus, with methylated receptors, kinase inhibition appears to only occur at ligand concentrations where the receptors are almost fully occupied. The lack of a direct correlation between receptor occupancy and kinase inhibition was even more apparent with deamidated receptors. Deamidation caused a dramatic reduction of almost 2 orders of magnitude in the concentration of serine required for 50% inhibition from 50 to 0.8 μm (Fig. 6). As in the case of methylation, deamidation had little effect on serine binding (K d= 10 ± 2 μm). The results with deamidated receptors recapitulate the large responses that have been observed in vivo to subsaturating concentrations of attractants,e.g. at 0.10 μm serine, receptor occupancy was <1%, but kinase inhibition was >10% (Fig. 6). The inhibition data obtained with the modified receptors indicated the same moderate degree of cooperativity as was observed with the wild type receptor, with a Hill coefficient of 1.8 for the deamidated receptor and ∼1.6 for the methylated receptor (Fig. 7).Figure 7Hill plot for the inhibitory effect of serine on kinase activity of the Tsr·CheW·CheA complex as a function of receptor methylation status.

Thus, by controlling levels of receptor methylation in response to environmental conditions, cells can adjust the gain of their receptor signaling systems to achieve optimal sensitivities (41Stock J. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We have examined the relationship between CheA kinase activity and serine binding with receptor signaling complexes formed by incubating membranes enriched for Tsr with purified CheW and CheA proteins. The results clearly show that there is no direct relationship between serine receptor occupancy and kinase inhibition. Instead, the degree of inhibition of kinase activity at a given level of serine binding depends on the level of glutamyl modification (methylation or amidation). At high levels of methylation, receptors must be nearly saturated with serine before kinase inhibition is apparent; at low levels of modification, very low levels of serine binding dramatically inhibit kinase activity. It has been known for some time that at low levels of methylation, cells exhibit large responses to subsaturating concentrations of attractant stimuli and that the increases in methylation induced by attractants cause cells to become unresponsive. The methylation-dependent loss of sensitivity that occurs with continued exposure to attractant stimuli has been termed adaptation. There are three ways that increases in methylation could counteract the inhibitory effects of attractant stimuli: (i) methylation could act directly to stimulate kinase activity. The direct affect of methylation on kinase activity seems to be too small to account for adaptation; however, whereas attractant binding causes >99% kinase inhibition, receptor methylation causes only about a 2-fold increase in kinase activity (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Bornhorst J.A. Falke J.J.

(ii) Methylation could cause adaptation by inhibiting attractant binding (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but there is considerable evidence presented here and elsewhere that methylation has little affect on the stoichiometry or affinity of binding to receptors as well as receptor-kinase complexes (19Borkovich K.A.

Our results strongly support a role for methylation in controlling the gain of the receptor signaling system. Cellular responses to attractants such as serine or aspartate do not correlate with the changes in receptor occupancy predicted fromin vitro receptor binding studies. How can cells exhibit significant motor responses to concentrations of attractants that are too low to occupy more than a few out of the thousands of receptors in a cell (10Li G. Weis R.M.

https://openalex.org/W1986718308,"RhoA, in its active GTP-bound form, stimulates transcription through activation of the serum-response factor (SRF). We found that cGMP inhibited serum-induced Rho·GTP loading and transcriptional activation of SRF-dependent reporter genes in smooth muscle and glial cells in a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase)-dependent fashion. Serum stimulation of the SRF target gene vinculin was also blocked by cGMP/G-kinase. G-kinase activation inhibited SRF-dependent transcription induced by upstream RhoA activators including Gα13 and p115RhoGEF, with Gα13-induced Rho·GTP loading inhibited by G-kinase. G-kinase had no effect on the high activation levels of RhoA(63L) or the double mutant RhoA(63L,188A) but inhibited transcriptional activation by these two RhoA mutants to a similar extent, suggesting an effect downstream of RhoA and independent of RhoA Ser188phosphorylation. Constitutively active forms of the Rho effectors Rho kinase (ROK), PKN, and PRK-2 induced SRF-dependent transcription in a cell type-specific fashion with ROK being the most efficient; G-kinase inhibited transcription induced by all three effectors without affecting ROK catalytic activity. G-kinase had no effect on RhoA(63L)-induced morphological changes in glial cells, suggesting distinct transcriptional and cytoskeletal effectors of RhoA. We conclude that G-kinase inhibits SRF-dependent transcription by interfering with RhoA signaling; G-kinase acts both upstream of RhoA, inhibiting serum- or Gα13-induced Rho activation, and downstream of RhoA, inhibiting steps distal to the Rho targets ROK, PKN, and PRK-2. RhoA, in its active GTP-bound form, stimulates transcription through activation of the serum-response factor (SRF). We found that cGMP inhibited serum-induced Rho·GTP loading and transcriptional activation of SRF-dependent reporter genes in smooth muscle and glial cells in a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (G-kinase)-dependent fashion. Serum stimulation of the SRF target gene vinculin was also blocked by cGMP/G-kinase. G-kinase activation inhibited SRF-dependent transcription induced by upstream RhoA activators including Gα13 and p115RhoGEF, with Gα13-induced Rho·GTP loading inhibited by G-kinase. G-kinase had no effect on the high activation levels of RhoA(63L) or the double mutant RhoA(63L,188A) but inhibited transcriptional activation by these two RhoA mutants to a similar extent, suggesting an effect downstream of RhoA and independent of RhoA Ser188phosphorylation.

RhoA is activated downstream of multiple membrane receptors, for example the thrombin and lysophosphatidic acid receptors, which couple to the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gα12 and Gα13 and activate RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors, e.g.p115RhoGEF (1Takai Y.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). RhoA-induced cytoskeletal changes include formation of F-actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, and RhoA-mediated smooth muscle contraction involves calcium sensitization of the contractile apparatus (1Takai Y.

Downstream effectors of RhoA include the Rho kinase (ROK)1family, the protein kinase C-related kinases PRK-1 (also called PKN) and PRK-2, mDia, and rhotekin (2Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar).As a regulator of gene expression, RhoA modulates the activity of the ubiquitous serum-response factor (SRF), which binds to the sequence CC(A/T)6GG in the core of the serum-response element (SRE) (3Bar-Sagi D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Induction of immediate early genes, e.g.c-fos, by serum and growth factors is mediated by SRF in cooperation with a ternary complex factor (TCF) that is controlled by the Ras-Raf-MEK-Erk pathway (8Gineitis D. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24531-24539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SRF target genes also include vinculin and many muscle-specific genes, but promoters of these genes lack TCF-binding sites, and SRF appears to cooperate with other cell type-specific transcription factors (4Wei L.

Activated RhoA increases transcription of smooth muscle-specific promoters and SRF-dependent reporter genes, whereas RhoA inactivation by C3 exoenzyme abolishes their transcription. RhoA activation has little effect on the c-fos promoter, but RhoA inactivation inhibits c-fos induction by various growth factors, indicating that at least basal RhoA activity is required for c-fos induction (8Gineitis D.

Although the mechanism(s) by which RhoA regulates SRF activity are incompletely defined, recent studies (8Gineitis D. Treisman R. J. Biol.

Others (11Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8506-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have suggested that SRF activation by RhoA requires the cooperation of SRF with NF-6B and C/EBPβ. RhoA signaling to SRF cannot be attributed to a single known downstream effector, and RhoA effector mutants suggest distinct but partially overlapping effector pathways for cytoskeletal reorganization and SRF activation (12Sahai E.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RhoA prenylation may not be required for induction of SRF-dependent transcription but is required for the cytoskeletal effects of RhoA, also suggesting different pathways (14Allal C. Favre G.

Homozygous deletion of the G-kinase I gene in mice abolishes NO/cGMP-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle, resulting in severe vascular and intestinal dysfunction with death at an early age (18Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S., Ny, L. Sausbier M. Hirneiβ C. Wang G.-X. Korth M. Aszòdi A. Andersson K.-E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). G-kinase I affects smooth muscle tone by decreasing the release of calcium from intracellular stores and by reducing calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus (16Ruth P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); the latter effect is due to a direct inhibition of RhoA-induced calcium sensitization of SMC contraction by G-kinase I (19Sauzeau V. Jeune H.L. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

Additional reports have confirmed inhibition of RhoA functions by the NO/cGMP/G-kinase signaling pathway. Insulin-induced relaxation of vascular SMCs is mediated via NO/cGMP/G-kinase inhibition of RhoA (20Sandu O.A. Ito M. Begum N. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and SMC contraction induced by constitutively active mutants of Gα12 and Gα13 is RhoA-dependent and inhibited by cGMP analogs (21Gohla A. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Incubation of SMCs or G-kinase-transfected HeLa cells with NO donors or cGMP analogs prevents membrane translocation of activated RhoA and induces disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton (19Sauzeau V. Jeune H.L. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

The effects of NO and cGMP on the actin cytoskeleton are absent in G-kinase-deficient cells and restored by transfection of cells with G-kinase I, indicating that they are mediated by G-kinase (19Sauzeau V.

G-kinase I phosphorylates RhoA in vitro on Ser188, and the cytoskeletal effects of G-kinase activation are inhibited by expression of a mutant RhoA(A188), suggesting that inhibition of RhoA cytoskeletal functions by G-kinase I is at least partially due to phosphorylation of serine 188 (19Sauzeau V. Jeune H.L. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol.

The precise mechanism of G-kinase action is not known; however, in fibroblasts and neuronal/glial cells, transactivation of the c-fos promoter by G-kinase I requires an intact cAMP response element (CRE), nuclear translocation of the kinase, and phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein (25Gudi T.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6324-6333Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the effect of G-kinase on RhoA-mediated gene expression has not yet been examined.We now show that G-kinase inhibits SRE/SRF-dependent transcription induced by serum or by constitutively active forms of Gα12/Gα13 and p115RhoGEF in smooth muscle cells and glial cells. G-kinase inhibited the activation of endogenous, cellular RhoA by serum, had no effect on the high activation level of mutant RhoA(63L), but inhibited transcriptional activation by RhoA(63L) and RhoA(63L, 188A). These data suggest that G-kinase acts both upstream and downstream of RhoA. Of the downstream effectors studied, constitutively active ROK, PKN, and PRK-2 significantly activated the SRE-dependent reporter in a cell type-specific manner, and the transcriptional effects of all three kinases were inhibited by G-kinase activation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study demonstrate that the cGMP/G-kinase signaling pathway inhibits SRE/SRF-dependent transcription through inhibition of RhoA signaling. Treating cells with cGMP inhibited SRE-dependent transcription induced by serum, by upstream activators of RhoA, and by constitutively active RhoA mutants in a G-kinase-dependent fashion; it also inhibited serum induction of the SRF target gene vinculin. G-kinase inhibited RhoA signaling by both upstream and downstream mechanisms: (i) G-kinase inhibited RhoA activation by serum and Gα13; and (ii) G-kinase inhibited transcription induced by constitutively active RhoA mutants and by the constitutively active Rho effector kinases ROK, PKN, and PRK-2. These effects were observed both in cells of smooth muscle and neuronal origin. The regulation of RhoA-dependent transcription by the NO/cGMP/G-kinase pathway may play an important role during smooth muscle differentiation and cardiac hypertrophy, because recent studies have demonstrated that RhoA signaling to SRF is required for expression of smooth muscle-specific genes during muscle differentiation and is involved in transcriptional responses associated with cardiac hypertrophy (4Wei L.

On the other hand, RhoA activation has little effect on the intact fos promoter, consistent with the finding that cGMP/G-kinase activates the fos promoter and increases c-fos mRNA expression in serum-starved cells through RhoA/SRE-independent mechanisms (8Gineitis D.

In vascular SMCs, G-kinase inhibits RhoA-induced calcium sensitization of the contractile apparatus, which contributes to the vasodilatory effects of NO/cGMP (16Ruth P. Pharmacol.

G-kinase inhibits RhoA but not RhoA(188A)-induced calcium sensitization of SMC contraction, and cells transfected with RhoA(188A) are protected from G-kinase-induced stress fiber disassembly (19Sauzeau V.

These findings have led to the hypothesis that protein kinase A/G-kinase phosphorylation of RhoA may lead to membrane dissociation and interfere with Rho/Rho-GEF association leading to decreased Rho activity (67Laudanna C.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) demonstrated that integrin-induced RhoA activation and membrane translocation was inhibited by increased intracellular cAMP concentrations.Activation of G-kinase has also been shown to prevent agonist-induced RhoA membrane translocation suggesting inhibition of RhoA activation, but RhoA·GTP levels were not measured in these studies (19Sauzeau V.

We found that G-kinase activation inhibited serum-induced RhoA·GTP loading in BoASMCs, CS54 cells, and in G-kinase-expressing but not in G-kinase-deficient C6 cells. The results with C6 cells exclude the possibility that cross-activation of protein kinase A by cGMP might be responsible for the reduction in Rho·GTP levels. Although serum stimulation of RhoA activity was modest in all three cell types studied, it was similar to that described in other cell types (28Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Transfection of a constitutively active Gα13increased RhoA·GTP loading more dramatically, and the effect was inhibited by G-kinase. Transfection of the constitutively active ΔN-p115RhoGEF increased RhoA·GTP loading to a similar extent as that observed with Gα13, but in contrast to Gα13, the effect of this GEF construct was resistant to G-kinase inhibition. These results suggest that G-kinase may inhibit the function of an endogenous GEF responsible for RhoA activation by serum and Gα13, e.g. by interrupting the interaction of the GEF with its upstream regulator or with RhoA. An overexpressed, constitutively active ΔN-p115RhoGEF could be resistant to G-kinase inhibition because the GEF activity is independent of G-protein activation, the altered GEF is no longer sensitive to G-kinase, or high concentrations of active GEF may force an interaction with RhoA irrespective of G-kinase phosphorylation. Compared with ΔN-p115RhoGEF, transfection of full-length, wild type p115RhoGEF increased RhoA·GTP loading significantly less, and its effect appeared to be inhibited by cGMP/G-kinase. However, activation of RhoA by wild type p115 was marginal, and the effect of cGMP did not reach statistical significance. More work is required to identify the exact mechanism(s) by which G-kinase inhibits Rho activation.Although RhoA Ser188 phosphorylation by G-kinase or protein kinase A may induce changes in RhoA membrane association and interfere with RhoA activation by GEFs (67Laudanna C.

https://openalex.org/W2119097234,"CYP27-overexpressed transgenic mice were generated with the use of a human full-length CYP27 coding region cloned into a ubiquitous expression vector. Positive transgenic mice were identified by tail DNA genotyping and high fecal 27-hydroxycholesterol content. The levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol were found to be 3–5 times higher in the circulation and the tissues of the overexpressed mice when compared with littermate controls. There were no gross morphological differences between the overexpressed mice and their controls. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not affected by overexpression of CYP27. Serum lathosterol was also normal, suggesting a normal rate of cholesterol synthesis. Serum levels of 7α-hydroxycholesterol were unaffected, suggesting a normal rate of bile acid formation in the pathway involving cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. Biliary bile acid composition was slightly affected by CYP27 overexpression in female but not in male mice. Fecal levels of neutral steroids were slightly but significantly increased in overexpressor female mice but not in male mice. Levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation were significantly reduced in the overexpressed mice, probably as a consequence of a recently described catabolic pathway involving CYP27. Combined with the results of our previous work on mice with a disruption of the CYP27gene, the present results suggest that the levels of 27-hydroxycholesterol are not of critical importance for cholesterol homeostasis in mice.

J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the so-called classical or neutral pathway of bile acid synthesis initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), CYP27 catalyzes a step in the degradation of the steroid side chain of a 7α-hydroxylated intermediate. In an alternative pathway called the acidic pathway, CYP27 enzyme initiates the overall conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. The majority of the enzymes involved in bile acid biosynthesis are strictly expressed in the liver. However, the broad distribution of CYP27 in various tissues (2Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbøck H. Jo¨rnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the possibility that this enzyme may have a role other than in bile acid biosynthesis. In vitro studies have shown the product of the enzyme, 27-hydroxycholesterol, to be a potent suppressor of cholesterol synthesis in cultured cells (3Esterman A.L. Baum H. Javitt N.B. Darlington G.J. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1304-1309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Axelsson M. Larsson O. J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6863-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 27-hydroxycholesterol may be an important factor in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. While the above in vitro results are in accordance with this hypothesis, the results of some in vivo studies have not supported it (7Lund E. Breuer O. Bjo¨rkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25092-25097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lund E. Bjo¨rkhem I. Acc. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 241-249Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since CYP27 has a broad distribution in various cells and tissues, conversion of cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid occurs not only in the liver but also in extrahepatic tissues (9Bjo¨rkhem I. Diczfalusy U. Lutjohann D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As a consequence, there is a continuous flux of 27-oxygenated cholesterol metabolites from extrahepatic organs to the liver where the metabolites are further metabolized into bile acids. Based on in vivo experiments in humans, it has been estimated that 5–10% of the total production of bile acids starts with extrahepatic 27-oxygenation of cholesterol (10Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjovall J. Bjo¨rkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,11Duane C. Javitt N.B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since human macrophages are able to utilize CYP27 for elimination of part of their cholesterol (12Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjo¨rkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), this mechanism may have a preventive effect on the development of atherosclerosis. In accordance with this hypothesis, affected patients with the rare inherited disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis lack CYP27 and often develop premature atherosclerosis (13Bjo¨rkhem I. Boberg K.M. Leitersdorf E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. MacGraw Hill Publishing Division, New York2001: 2961-2988Google Scholar). Previouly we developed and characterized mice lacking thecyp27 gene (14Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpitzen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjo¨rkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Repa J.J. Lund E.G. Horton J.D. Leitersdorf E. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39685-39692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These mice were found to have a dramatic decrease in the rate of bile acid synthesis. As a consequence, there was compensatory up-regulation of CYP7A1 and of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, HMG1-CoA reductase. Intestinal cholesterol absorption was drastically decreased (15Repa J.J. Lund E.G. Horton J.D. Leitersdorf E. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39685-39692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The mRNA for the cholesterogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 was also increased (15Repa J.J. Lund E.G. Horton J.D. Leitersdorf E. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39685-39692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Despite these changes, the levels of cholesterol in the circulation were unaffected or only slightly affected by the lack of the cyp27 gene. Whether all of the above changes are secondary to the reduced formation of bile acids only or whether the lack of 27-hydroxycholesterol is of some importance is difficult to evaluate. In any case, thecyp27-deficient mice did not develop the symptoms found in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, namely xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, accumulation of cholestanol, and excretion of great amounts of bile alcohols (13Bjo¨rkhem I. Boberg K.M. Leitersdorf E. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. MacGraw Hill Publishing Division, New York2001: 2961-2988Google Scholar). The metabolic situation in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is complicated by the fact that the loss of CYP27 leads to one antiatherogenic effect (markedly increased degradation of cholesterol into bile alcohols) and one atherogenic effect (loss of the oxidative mechanism for removal of cholesterol from macrophages). The balance between these two effects may vary from patient to patient (9Bjo¨rkhem I. Diczfalusy U. Lutjohann D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the influence of CYP27 and 27-hydroxycholesterol on the composition of bile acids, on cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and on extrahepatic cholesterol efflux as exemplified by the development of atherosclerosis, we sought to generate an animal model with marked changes in the levels of the 27-oxygenated steroids without a simultaneous marked change in bile acid biosynthesis. In the present work we describe the development and characterization of a transgenic mouse model with an overexpressed human CYP27. A 1.8-kb fragment encoding for the human CYP27 cDNA (a generous gift from Prof. D. Russell; Ref. 16Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into theEcoRI restriction site in pCAGGS expression vector (kindly provided by Prof. J. Miyazaki; Ref. 17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar). pCAGGS, which contains the chicken β-actin promoter and rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal, permitted ubiquitous overexpression of the human CYP27cDNA in all tissues. A linear purified DNA construct was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs taken from superovulated CBA females, and reimplanted into CBA × C57Bl/6J F1 surrogate mothers. Positive transgenic mice were identified by tail DNA/PCR genotyping and by the presence of high fecal 27-hydroxycholesterol in comparison to C57Bl/6J control andcyp27 knock-out mice. Founder animals were crossed with C57Bl/6J mice (Harlan Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) for eight generations to create a congenic line (C57Bl/6J background >99.5%). The mice were fed a normal chow diet and housed in a sterile pathogen-free animal house under a 12-h light/dark regime. Twelve mice in the fourth backcrossed generation were fed a Western-type diet without sodium cholate (TD 88137, Harlan Teklad) for a period of 4 weeks. All experiments were performed on adult male and/or female transgenic mice obtained by backcrossing (lines 23 and 34) and on age- and sex-matched wild type C57Bl/6J animals. Tail tip DNA was screened by PCR. Mouse tail tip was incubated overnight in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 100 μg of Proteinase K at 55 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2) and precipitated with isopropanol. PCR amplification was performed using primers common to the mouse endogenic and human transgenic CYP27 sequences. Amplification conditions were denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min repeated 35 times using 5′-CTC TAC CCT GTG GTC CCC ACA-3′ as forward primer and 5′-AAC CAG GAC AAT GCG GGC CAC-3′ as reverse primer. PCR products resulted in a 366-bp fragment for the human cDNA transgene sequence and a 598-bp band for the genomic mouse fragment. Total cellular extracts prepared from mouse tissues were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween) followed by incubation with anti-CYP27 antibody (a kind gift from Prof. D. Russell, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Following washing with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by the Amersham Biosciences enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL). Animals were anesthetized with 0.5–1 ml of Avertin (tert-amyl alcohol, 2,2,2-tribromoethanol; Sigma) injected intraperitoneally. Following Avertin anesthetization, blood samples were collected from the inferior vena cava and transferred into tubes, and serum was collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen after centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized mechanically, and extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Oxysterols (7α-hydroxycholesterol, 24-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol) in serum and in various organs were analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry with the use of deuterium-labeled internal standards as described previously (18Dzeletovic S. Breuer O. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Serum levels of lathosterol, reflecting cholesterol synthesis, were also analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry as described previously (19Lund E. Sisfontes L. Reihner E. Bjo¨rkhem I. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1989; 49: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Serum and lipoprotein lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids) were determined by enzymatic assays adapted to microtiter plates using commercially available reagents (BioMerieux, Lyon, France) (cholesterol RTU, triglycerides PAP 1000, and phospholipids PAP 150). True triglycerides without glycerol interferences were measured enzymatically using a kit from Sigma Diagnostics. Fecal bile acids and neutral steroids were analyzed as described previously (14Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpitzen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjo¨rkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Serum levels of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apoA-II, apoB, and apoC-III were measured by an immunonephelemetric assay using specific polyclonal antibodies (20Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Organs were removed from transgenicCYP27overexp mice and from their nontransgenic littermates (age- and gender-matched). These included the liver, kidneys, adrenals, spleen, pancreas, heart, lungs, and brain, all of which were removed and weighed. A skin and a muscle sample were also obtained from each mouse. Half of each tissue removed was fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. Five-micrometer-thick sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Thirty-five pups were born from females implanted with fertilized eggs injected with the purified fragment of pCAGGS CYP27 expression construct (Fig. 1A). Five positive human CYP27 overexpressor transgenic mice were identified by tail DNA genotyping. CYP27 protein expression was examined in various tissues taken from these animals. Western blot analysis showed ubiquitous expression of human CYP27 in all organs from all five founders (not shown) as compared with control C57Bl/6J mice, which expressed the murine protein exclusively in the liver (Fig.1B). Lines 23 and 34 were studied extensively. These animals were viable and fertile and exhibited no overt morbidity. Analysis of protein expression in the highest positive CYP27 founder transgenic mouse is shown in Fig. 1B. 27-Hydroxycholesterol content in feces of these five presumed founders was measured. In two of them, a 2–3-fold increase was observed when compared with nontransgenic control siblings (2.15–3.3 versus 0.89 μg/g of feces for the highest control value). Line 23 (highest overexpressor) and line 34 (with lower overexpression) were crossed to C57Bl/6J mice and propagated to create congenic lines. While crossing the human CYP27 overexpressor transgenic mice, the 27-hydroxycholesterol concentration in mice serum and tissues was analyzed. Results from three to six mice, humanCYP27 overexpressor and controls, from the third, fourth, and fifth backcrossed generations showed a 5-fold increase in concentration for line 34 and a 9-fold increase for line 23 (Fig. 2). Genetically homogeneous mice (>99.5%) on a C57Bl/6J background were physically and biochemically characterized. Twelve-week-old (females and males) CYP27overexp mice and control siblings fed a normal chow diet were sacrificed. No macroscopic differences in external or internal general appearance were observed betweenCYP27overexp transgenic and control siblings. Total body weight and most internal organ weights were similar in transgenic CYP27overexp and control mice. The adrenal glands of the overexpressor males were significantly larger than those of control males (0.2 ± 0.01 versus0.1 ± 0.03 mg/g of total body weight, respectively;p = 0.001; see TableI).Table IPhysical characterization of CYP27 overexpressor and control miceFemale controls (n = 3)Female overexpressors (n = 3)Male controls (n = 6)Male overexpressors (n = 7)Total body weight (g)24.3 ± 1.226.7 ± 2.533.7 ± 3.330.4 ± 2.6Brain1-aAll internal organ weights expressed as mg/g of total body weight.18.8 ± 1.616.4 ± 2.213.7 ± 0.814.1 ± 1.2Liver49.8 ± 7.651.9 ± 6.248.9 ± 9.048.5 ± 5.6Lungs6.3 ± 0.85.8 ± 0.25.3 ± 0.95.9 ± 0.6Kidneys11.9 ± 1.311.8 ± 2.211.4 ± 0.911.2 ± 0.6Heart5.0 ± 1.44.8 ± 0.54.3 ± 0.24.6 ± 0.3Spleen3.7 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.4Adrenals0.4 ± 0.030.4 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.030.2 ± 0.011-bp = 0.001 (Student's t test).Shown are mean total body weight and mean organ weights (milligram per gram of body weight) from 10 overexpressor and nine control littermates (males and females) from line 23, eighth generation.

Values are mean ± S.D. None of the sampled organs showed any gross morphological changes. No obvious histological differences were observed between the groups. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained preparations did not reveal an excess of macrophages in the overexpressor mice lungs that might explain the high amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol in that tissue. Mice serum lipid content was analyzed in 10 transgenic CYP27overexp mice and nine control littermates. Total cholesterol in serum was similar in both groups: 0.78 ± 0.09 (S.D.) mg/ml in transgenic mice and 0.78 ± 0.12 mg/ml in the control group. Similar values for total triglycerides, true triglycerides, and phospholipid concentration were found in both groups. Values of 1.06 ± 0.31 mg/ml for total triglycerides, 0.24 ± 0.14 mg/ml for true triglycerides, and 1.49 ± 0.18 mg/ml for phospholipid were measured in the transgenic group compared with 0.83 ± 0.17, 0.15 ± 0.05, and 1.52 ± 0.22 mg/ml, respectively, in controls (Fig.3). Similarly, when males and females were compared separately, there were no significant differences between the values for any of the above parameters. Measurement of apolipoprotein concentrations in serum fromCYP27overexp and control groups did not show any significant differences between groups. ApoA-I (CYP27overexp, 0.38 ± 0.03 mg/ml; control, 0.37 ± 0.02 mg/ml), apoA-II (CYP27overexp, 0.32 ± 0.02 mg/ml; control, 0.32 ± 0.02 mg/ml), apoB (CYP27overexp, 0.13 ± 0.01 mg/ml; control, 0.12 ± 0.01 mg/ml), and apoC-III (CYP27overexp, 0.32 ± 0.02 mg/ml; control, 0.30 ± 0.02 mg/ml) concentrations were similar when groups were composed of males and females combined. As males outnumbered females in both control and transgenic groups, comparisons of apolipoprotein concentrations between male groups only showed no significant differences (data not shown). Serum levels of lathosterol did not differ between the two groups. Lathosterol levels were found to be 24 ± 6 ng/ml in the controls (n = 4) and 24 ± 5 ng/ml in CYP27overexp mice (n = 3). TableII summarizes the results of the measurements of bile acids in bile of theCYP27overexp animals and their controls. The relative concentration of cholic acid was slightly lower in bile of female CYP27overexp than in that of their controls (p < 0.05), but this was not the case in the male overexpressors. The relative concentration of α-muricholic acid in bile of female overexpressors was higher than in that of their controls (p < 0.05), but again this was not true of bile of males. The ratio between 12α-hydroxylated bile acids and non-12α-hydroxylated bile acids in bile was slightly lower in female CYP27 overexpressors than in controls, but this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In male mice the above ratio was almost identical in the two groups of animals (Table II).Table IIBiliary bile acid composition in CYP27 overexpressor and control miceFemale controls (n = 3)Female overexpressors (n = 3)Male controls (n = 6)Male overexpressors (n = 7)Cholic acid54.2 ± 4.245.4 ± 2.52-ap < 0.05 (Student’s t test).56.4 ± 6.959.2 ± 5.6Deoxycholic acid1.7 ± 1.41.5 ± 1.22.5 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.7Ursodeoxycholic acid1.5 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.3Chenodeoxycholic acid1.7 ± 1.13.5 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.4α-Muricholic acid7.2 ± 1.711.6 ± 1.22-ap < 0.05 (Student’s t test).7.0 ± 1.06.3 ± 1.7β-Muricholic acid27.4 ± 6.630.7 ± 4.021.3 ± 5.723.4 ± 5.5ω-Muricholic acid5.1 ± 0.94.0 ± 1.45.9 ± 2.03.7 ± 1.0Cholic acid isomer0.7 ± 0.50.6 ± 0.24.1 ± 0.63.0 ± 0.812α-Hydroxylated bile acids/non- 12α-hydroxylated bile acids1.4 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.2Shown are the relative concentrations of biliary bile acids (expressed as percentages) in overexpressor and control mice.2-a p < 0.05 (Student’s t test).

Neutral steroids were quantitated in pools of feces collected from fourCYP27overexp female mice during 3 days and from six female control mice during the same time period. A similar collection was performed for three male control mice and three male overexpressor mice. The amount of feces produced per day and animal was not different in the two cases. The amounts of cholesterol, coprostanol, and cholestanol excreted by the control female mice were slightly but significantly lower than inCYP27overexp mice (0.93 ± 0.04 and 1.10 ± 0.01 mg/g of feces, respectively (p < 0.001)). In male mice, the difference between the amounts of the above neutral steroids excreted by overexpressors versus controls was not significant (1.1 ± 0.0 and 1.2 ± 0.1 mg/g of feces, respectively). CYP27 ubiquitous overexpression was corroborated by the presence of high amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum, liver, and lungs of theCYP27overexp group. 27-Hydroxycholesterol levels in serum were 2.7 times higher in CYP27overexpmice than in their normal littermates (113 and 41 ng/ml, respectively). In the liver (122 versus 29 ng/100 mg of tissue) and lungs (125 versus 25.2 ng/100 mg of tissue) these levels were markedly increased (4.2 and 5 times higher, respectively). In general, the levels were higher in the female groups despite the fact that they had lower body weight than the males (see TableIII for transgene status gender-specific results). Analysis of 24-hydroxycholesterol in the liver and lungs revealed no significant differences between overexpressors and controls. The serum levels of 24-hydroxycholesterol were, however, significantly lower in the transgenic animals. This effect was most accentuated in the female group. The selective increase of 27-hydroxycholesterol in combination with the normal levels of the other oxysterols confirm the specific overexpression ofCYP27 by the ubiquitous promoter.Table IIISerum and tissue oxysterol levels in CYP27 overexpressor and control miceMale controls (n = 6)Male overexpressors (n = 7)SerumLiverLungSerum3-an = 5.LiverLungng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mgng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mg27-OH-Cholesterol3-bp < 0.001 for all comparisons between overexpressors and controls with respect to 27-OH-cholesterol.34.8 ± 8.124.5 ± 5.825.9 ± 6.6192.0 ± 24.23-an = 5.99.8 ± 10.4123.5 ± 16.924-OH-Cholesterol13.3 ± 5.09.7 ± 2.328.2 ± 4.36.6 ± 1.83-cp < 0.05.7.6 ± 2.320.5 ± 3.13-dp < 0.005.Female controls (n = 3)Female overexpressors (n = 3)SerumLiverLungSerum3-eSingle sample only.LiverLungng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mgng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mg27-OH-Cholesterol3-bp < 0.001 for all comparisons between overexpressors and controls with respect to 27-OH-cholesterol.20.7 ± 1.237.4 ± 2.823.8 ± 3.4149172.6 ± 6.1129.3 ± 4.424-OH-Cholesterol19.0 ± 9.511.5 ± 1.825.9 ± 8.9910.9 ± 1.421.9 ± 2.3Shown are mean serum and tissue oxysterol levels in male and femaleCYP27 overexpressor mice versus control littermates from generation 8, line 23.

SevenCYP27overexp mice and five control littermates (females and males from the fourth backcrossed generation) were challenged with a high fat diet for a period of 3 weeks. Overall average weight gain was similar in the two groups: 7.8 ± 0.79 g in CYP27overexp and 8.8 ± 1.39 g in controls, although female transgenic mice demonstrated somewhat less weight gain compared with controls (6.2 versus8.5 g, respectively). Serum analysis of the fourth backcrossed generation (CYP27overexp × C57Bl/6J) showed constant 7α-hydroxycholesterol concentration in both groups (TableIV). Histologically the high fat diet caused striking centrilobular microvesicular steatosis and mild periportal macrovesicular steatosis in the livers of all males regardless of CYP27 expression level. In female mice, periportal macrovesicular steatosis appeared more prominent than in males, but this too appeared unrelated to the transgene. The histological appearance of the lungs was normal and unaffected by high fat diet challenge.Table IVEffect of diet on serum and tissue hydroxysterol levels in CYP27 overexpressor and control miceMale controls (n = 3)Male overexpressors (n = 4)SerumLiverLungSerumLiverLungng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mgng/mlng/100 mgng/100 mg27-OH-Cholesterol107.7 ± 24.058 ± 5.331 ± 8530 ± 58.64-ap < 0.001.158.3 ± 35.74-bp < 0.05.179.5 ± 27.44-cp < 0.005.24-OH-Cholesterol44 ± 10.669.3 ± 5.1NT28.8 ± 4.64-bp < 0.05.43.5 ± 7.94-cp < 0.005.NT7-α-OH-Cholesterol36.3 ± 15.0NTNT23 ± 6.2NTNTFemale controls (n = 2)Female overexpressors (n = 3)27-OH-Cholesterol90 ± 4.277.5 ± 3.526 ± 0480.3 ± 30.24-ap < 0.001.265.7 ± 76.24-bp < 0.05.160.7 ± 20.64-cp < 0.005.24-OH-Cholesterol41 ± 1.499 ± 5.7NT33.7 ± 4.057.7 ± 15.04-bp < 0.05.NT7-α-OH-Cholesterol43 ± 8.5NTNT68.7 ± 20.4NTNTShown are mean serum and tissue oxysterol levels in transgenic and control (male and female) mice from generation 4, line 23.

In theliver, the overexpression is expected to lead to increased utilization of the acid pathway of bile acid biosynthesis both as a consequence of the increased amount of CYP27 in the liver and as a consequence of the greater flux of 27-oxygenated metabolites to the liver. It was recently reported by Hall et al. (21Hall E.A. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. Mallonee D. Valerie K. Avadhani N.G. Pandak W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G293-G301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that infection of HepG2 cells with adenovirus encoding CYP27 is associated with increased bile acid synthesis and increased levels of HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein receptor activity. The latter two effects may have been secondary to cholesterol depletion in hepatocytes as a consequence of rapid bile acid synthesis. If increased bile acid synthesis in the liver of the present mice with overexpressedCYP27 occurs, this increase does not reduce the levels of cholesterol in the liver or the rate of synthesis of cholesterol.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system can also cause a dementia, and amyloid deposition in the central nervous system is significantly higher in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with uninfected controls. Here we report that Aβ fibrils stimulated, by 5–20-fold, infection of target cells expressing CD4 and an appropriate coreceptor by multiple HIV-1 isolates but did not permit infection of cells lacking these receptors. Aβ enhanced infection at the stage of virus attachment or entry into the cell. Aβ fibrils also stimulated infection by amphotrophic Moloney leukemia virus, herpes simplex virus, and viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. Other synthetic fibril-forming peptides similarly enhanced viral infection and may be useful in gene delivery applications utilizing retroviral vectors. These data suggest that Aβ deposition may increase the vulnerability of the central nervous system to enveloped viral infection and that amyloidogenic peptides could be useful in enhancing gene transfer by enveloped viral vectors.

The efficiency of gene delivery using retroviral vectors is often a limiting factor in attempts to express exogenous genes in both cultured mammalian cells and in vivo. Facilitators such as Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide) (1Toyoshima K. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1969; 38: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and DEAE-dextran (2Vogt P.K. Virology. 1967; 33: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have been utilized to increase the efficiency of viral infection. Vectors pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of various viruses are advantageous for targeting exogenous genes to specific cell types that express the cognate receptor molecules. Envelope glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 1The abbreviations used are: VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, β-amyloid; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; A-MuLV, amphotrophic Moloney leukemia virus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; APP, amyloid β precursor protein; HAD, HIV-associated dementia; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) utilize ubiquitously expressed receptors and are useful for transduction of varied cell types (3Jobbagy Z.

Envelope glycoproteins that require cell type-specific receptors, such as the gp120-gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can provide a useful tool for targeting exogenous genes to specific cell types. HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins facilitate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes through sequential binding of CD4 and a chemokine receptor, principally CCR5 or CXCR4 (5Dalgleish A.G. Beverley P.C.

HIV-1 infection of microglia in the central nervous system leads to HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in ∼20–30% of late-stage AIDS patients (11Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), and HIV-1 replication in the brain has been observed to colocalize with sites of APP accumulation (12Adle-Biassette H.

HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system and subsequent infection in the brain occur by mechanisms that remain poorly understood. It is believed that infection of macrophages, microglia, and possibly astrocytes leads to indirect neuronal injury and death, providing the basis for the development of HAD, a syndrome of cognitive and motor dysfunction diagnostically similar to AD-related dementia (11Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 14Smits H.A. Boven L.A. Pereira C.F. Verhoef J. Nottet H.S. Eur J. Clin.

A positive relationship between cerebrospinal fluid viral load and the extent to which patients with HAD or minor cognitive/motor disorder experience cognitive dysfunction has been described (16Ellis R.J. Hsia K. Spector S.A. Nelson J.A. Heaton R.K. Wallace M.R. Abramson I. Atkinson J.H. Grant I. McCutchan J.A. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Brew B.J.

Aβ-rich neuritic plaques are also observed to occur with greater prevalence in HIV-1-infected individuals compared with uninfected controls, although an etiological relationship between HAD and plaques has not been established (18Esiri M.M. Biddolph S.C. Morris C.S. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1998; 65: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, HIV-1-infected individuals bearing the ApoE4 allele, a genetic risk factor for AD that correlates with elevated Aβ levels (19Gearing M. Mori H. Mirra S.S. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), are twice as likely to be demented or have peripheral neuropathy as individuals lacking this allele (20Corder E.H. Robertson K.

ApoE4 is an AD susceptibility factor, particularly for individuals harboring herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the brain (21Dobson C.B. Itzhaki R.F. Neurobiol.

Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 1998; 154: 816-829PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the proteolytic fragments of APP, a common molecular marker of dementing disease states including AD, are implicated in the mechanism of HIV-1 brain infection remains unclear. We wished to address whether a relationship exists between the presence of APP proteolytic fragments and HIV-1 infection. Here we report that the amyloidogenic APP fragments Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, as well as other synthetic amyloidogenic peptides, significantly enhanced infection by HIV-1 and viruses with other envelope glycoproteins. The effect was stronger than the enhancement of infection observed using Polybrene. These findings are suggestive of a model that may explain how neuritic damage caused by HIV-1 infection in the brain and subsequent Aβ deposition induced by this damage may facilitate further HIV-1 infection. Additionally, they suggest a use for synthetic amyloidogenic peptides in both laboratory and clinical viral delivery systems. Lyophilized Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 fragments (California Peptide Research, Inc. and New England Peptide, Inc.), Aβ40–1 reverse fragment (Sigma), and low molecular weight peptides PPI-2480 and PPI-2566 (Praecis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) were dissolved in Me2SO to 5 mm and subsequently diluted to 200 μm in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, for Aβ1–42). Peptides were used fresh or incubated under conditions that support fibril formation as follows. Aβ1–40, PPI-2480, and PPI-2566 peptide solutions were incubated for 8 days at 37 °C, sonicated, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. Fibril formation for the Aβ1–42 peptide solution was allowed to proceed for 24 h at room temperature with stirring. The efficiency of fibril formation was verified by reaction with Congo Red or electron microscopy. Purity of all peptides was >98%. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.)

Thirty h after transfection, the virus-containing cell supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.45 μm), and aliquoted, and they were kept frozen until use. The reverse transcriptase activities of all viruses were quantified and normalized by cpm as described previously (37Rho H.M. Poiesz B. Ruscetti F.W. Gallo R.C.

Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was quantitated as described in Promega protocols using an EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB 96V. Target cells for viral entry were seeded in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (Dynex) at a density of 6 × 103 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. The medium was removed from the target cells and replaced with fresh complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing reverse transcriptase-normalized units of recombinant virus. The amounts of virus varied, depending upon the envelope glycoproteins used for pseudotyping: VSV-G, 1,000 cpm; A-MuLV, 30,000 cpm; and ADA, YU2, JR-FL, 89.6, ADA-Δ V1/V2, and HXBc2 HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, 10,000 cpm). Varying amounts of Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42 (1.25–20 μm), PPI-2566, or PPI-2480 (1–100 μm) were added with the recombinant viruses to a final infection volume of 50 μl. The anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 (39Wu L.

Target cells were incubated with the infection medium for 48 h. After this incubation, the medium was aspirated from each well, and the cells were lysed by the addition of 30 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), agitation, and two freeze-thaw cycles. The luciferase activity of each well was measured for 10 s after the addition of 100 μl of luciferase buffer (15 mm MgSO4, 15 mmKPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) and 50 μl of 1 mmd-luciferin potassium salt (BD PharMingen) using an EG&G Berthold Microplate Luminometer LB 96V. SupT1-CCR5 target cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well with medium containing reverse transcriptase-normalized units of GFP-expressing recombinant virus (VSV-G, 3,000 cpm; ADA, 150,000 cpm; YU2, 150,000 cpm) and varying amounts of Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 (62.5 nm to 1 μm) in a final volume of 0.4 ml. The infection medium-cell mixture was incubated for 48 h, 1 ml of fresh complete RPMI 1640 was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were then harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 10% formalin, and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a Becton Dickinson FACScan with CellQuest software. Cf2Th cells were infected with an A-MuLV vector expressing β-galactosidase without additives, in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene or in the presence of 10 μmpreaggregated Aβ40–1 reverse fragment or Aβ1–40. The precipitable fraction of Aβ1–40 was recovered by pelleting preaggregated Aβ1–40 at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, after which the supernatant was removed and retained. The precipitated peptide fibrils were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, washed two more times, and resuspended in the starting volume. The β-galactosidase expression in the target cells 24 h after infection was estimated using a chemiluminescence assay (Galacto-Star; Tropix, Inc.). Cf2Th cells were also infected with a single-round HSV virus vector (HD-2) (38Morrison L.A. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 689-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene in the presence of 5 or 10 μm preaggregated Aβ1–40. Cells were stained according to the Promega protocol and counted under the microscope 24 h after infection. Unilamellar small liposomes (liposomes) similar in size to HIV-1 were prepared from a 2:1 (M/M) mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2- oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine supplemented with 1% fluorescent rhodamine-lissamine B-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids), as reported previously (41Pedersen S. Jorgensen K. Baekmark T.R. Mouritsen O.G. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 554-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-labeled liposomes were incubated with Cf2Th cells in the presence and absence of peptide fibrils in the medium used for the viral entry assay (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h at 37 °C. Similarly, fluorescent Aβ1–40 fibrils (FITC-Aβ) were incubated with Cf2Th cells either lacking or expressing CD4 and/or CCR5, in the absence and presence of recombinant HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein from the JR-FL isolate. After incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and the association of rhodamine-labeled liposomes or FITC-Aβ with cells was analyzed using FACScan, as described above. Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells were also incubated without additives or with unlabeled preaggregated Aβ1–40, as described above, and the CD4 and CCR5 cell surface expression was detected using the anti-CD4 antibody RPA-T4-PE (BD PharMingen) and the anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7-PE (BD PharMingen) at a final concentration of 10 nm. To investigate whether the presence of Aβ affects HIV-1 infection of target cells, recombinant replication-defective HIV-1 vectors expressing firefly luciferase or GFP were used. These single-round viruses were pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of various HIV-1 isolates or with those of VSV or A-MuLV. The receptors for VSV and A-MuLV are ubiquitously expressed. Entry of viruses pseudotyped with the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins is dependent on the presence of CD4 or a chemokine receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4; the viruses pseudotyped with the VSV or A-MuLV envelope glycoproteins do not require CD4 or chemokine receptor expression on the target cells. Preaggregated Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 fibrils dramatically increased infection of Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells by HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of three CCR5-using primary HIV-1 isolates (ADA, YU2, and JR-FL) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1). Aβ1–40 similarly increased infection of GHOST(3)-CD4/CXCR4 cells by HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the CXCR4-using isolate, HXBc2 (Fig.1). Similar results were obtained by infecting a human T-lymphocyte cell line stably expressing CCR5 (SupT1-CCR5) with GFP-expressing viruses pseudotyped with ADA and YU2 envelope glycoproteins (data not shown). Aβ1–40 was more potent than Aβ1–42 and increased the entry of viruses by 2–10 times in a concentration range of 1–5 μm and by 5–30 times at a concentration of 20 μm. Infection of cells by viruses pseudotyped with the A-MuLV or VSV envelope glycoproteins was also enhanced. The relatively lower enhancement observed with VSV-G-pseudotyped virus may be due to the substantially greater efficiency with which this virus infects cells in the absence of Aβ. These data show that Aβ can substantially increase the efficiency of infection of cells by HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of a wide range of HIV-1 isolates, as well as with those of other enveloped viruses. To elucidate whether the enhancement of virus infection by Aβ was mediated by an increased efficiency of early or late events in the virus life cycle, incubation of the recombinant viruses with the Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 target cells was carried out for only 4 h, followed by washing. The target cells were incubated with 20 μm Aβ1–40 concurrently with virus (+/−), immediately after virus removal (−/+), or throughout both time periods (+/+) (Fig. 2). After the wash, the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h, at which time luciferase activity was measured. Enhancement of infection was observed only when Aβ1–40 was present during the initial 4-h incubation of virus and cells. These data suggest that Aβ exerts its effect at an early stage of viral infection. Because the first 4 h of HIV-1 infection involves virus attachment and entry into the host cell, Aβ likely enhances these processes. Aβ has been shown to exert a destabilizing effect on cellular membranes (42Yip C.M. McLaurin J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1359-1371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 43McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, Aβ might facilitate fusion of the target cell and viral membrane in a manner that would circumvent the dependence of the virus on its receptors. To investigate this possibility, we examined infection of Cf2Th, Cf2Th-CD4, Cf2Th-CCR5, and Cf2Th-CD4/CCR5 cells by CCR5-dependent HIV-1 isolates. No infection by CCR5-dependent HIV-1 isolates was observed in the presence or absence of Aβ with cells lacking CD4 and/or CCR5 (Fig.3 a), whereas infection by viruses pseudotyped by VSV and A-MuLV envelope glycoproteins, which do not require these cellular receptors, was enhanced by Aβ on all cells examined. Aβ-enhanced CCR5-dependent viral entry remained sensitive to inhibition by CCR5 ligands, including the 2D7 antibody (39Wu L. LaRosa G. Kassam N. Gordon C.J. Heath H. Ruffing N. Chen H. Humblias J.

These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection in the presence of Aβ remains dependent on the expression of CD4 and a chemokine coreceptor. Aβ aggregates into fibrils (8Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 42Yip C.M. McLaurin J. Biophys.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We investigated whether other fibril-forming peptides unrelated to Aβ could enhance virus infection. Fig. 4 shows that two such peptides, PPI-2480 (AGAKWSWWELTWVGG) and PPI-2566 (IRQAMCNISRADWND), which form fibrils similar to Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 (Fig. 5,b−f), also enhanced the infection efficiency of recombinant HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the ADA and YU2 HIV-1 isolates by 5–20-fold. The stimulation by these fibrils also required the expression of viral entry coreceptors (data not shown). These compounds enhanced infection of HIV-1 pseudotyped with the VSV-G protein by ∼2-fold. A number of control peptides of varying sequences and lengths that did not form fibrils had no effect on HIV-1 infection. An example is the peptide PPI-1966 shown in Figs. 4 and 5 f. These data demonstrate that the ability of a peptide to enhance viral infection correlates with its propensity to form fibrils in solution. Interestingly, the peptides that most potently enhance infection (Aβ1–40 and PPI-2480) formed shorter fibrils (Fig. 5,b and d), whereas peptides forming longer fibrils (Aβ1–42 and PPI-2566, Fig. 5, c ande) were less efficient.Figure 5Peptides that enhance viral infection form fibrils and promote lipid vesicle association with cells. a, Cf2Th cells were incubated with fluorescent liposomes (final concentration, 1 mg lipid/ml) in the presence of 10 μm preaggregated amyloidogenic peptides Aβ1–42 (gray curve), PPI-2566 (hatched curve), Aβ1–40 (black curve), PPI-2480 (dotted curve), or no peptide (white curve) and analyzed using FACScan. Nonamyloidogenic peptides, including PPI-1966, did not promote lipid vesicle association with cells (data not shown). b−f, negatively stained electron micrographs of amyloidogenic peptides, Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, PPI-2480, and PPI-2566 are shown (b−e, respectively). The nonamyloidogenic peptide PPI-1966 used as a control is also depicted (f). Thescale bar represents 100 nm (f).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the mechanism by which these fibril-forming peptides stimulate viral infection, we modeled the enveloped virus interaction with cells using liposomes. Rhodamine-labeled liposomes, approximately the size of HIV-1 (47Villar A.V. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Jones D.R. Leon Y. Varela-Nieto I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were incubated with cells under the conditions of viral infection in the presence and absence of Aβ1–40, Aβ1–42, PPI-2566, PPI-2480, and PPI-1966. The liposome-cell mixtures were then analyzed by FACScan (Fig. 5 a). Each of the fibril-forming peptides that enhanced infection also promoted irreversible association of liposomes with cells. The peptides did not cause the formation of syncytia, nor did they promote liposome-to-cell fusion, as judged by the failure of the rhodamine dye in the liposomes to distribute into the cell membrane (data not shown). Consistent with their relative ability to enhance infection, Aβ1–40 promoted the adherence of liposomes better than Aβ1–42. PPI-1966, which Fig. 5 f shows cannot form fibrils, had no effect on the association of liposomes with cells (data not shown). Utilizing fluorescent Aβ1–40 fibrils (FITC-Aβ), we found that FITC-Aβ associated with cell surfaces independent of CD4 or CCR5 expression (data not shown). The presence of recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (JR-FL gp120) in the medium did not promote the association of FITC-Aβ with cell membranes (data not shown). Additionally, the presence of Aβ1–40 did not induce changes in cell surface expression of CD4 or CCR5 (data not shown). These data support a model in which Aβ and other fibril-forming peptides enhance viral infection by mediating a physical association of viral envelopes with the cell lipid bilayer. As shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, infection by HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of A-MuLV was enhanced by Aβ. Infection by complete A-MuLV was also strikingly enhanced, from 30–50-fold, in the presence of preaggregated Ab1–40 (Fig. 6 a). This effect was 2–3-fold greater than that observed for Polybrene, a cationic polymer commonly used to increase the efficiency of retroviral gene delivery systems (48Le Doux J.M. Landazuri N. Yarmush M.L. Morgan J.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this experiment, Ab1–40fibrils were precipitated by multiple centrifugation and washing steps and compared with the supernatant of the first centrifugation. Fig.6 a demonstrates that the precipitable Ab1–40fraction, but not any residual soluble peptide, enhanced A-MuLV infection comparably to Ab1–40 that had not been centrifuged. Conversely, the Ab40–1 reverse fragment did not enhance the infection efficiency of A-MuLV. These data underscore the substantial enhancement of retroviral infectivity by Ab1–40 and demonstrate that the precipitable, and presumably fibril-forming, fraction of Aβ mediates its ability to enhance infection. Because HSV has been suggested to play a role in AD and is a major opportunistic infection observed in late-stage HIV-1 infection, we investigated the ability of Aβ to enhance HSV infection. A dose-dependent enhancement of the infection mediated by an HSV vector was observed (Fig. 6 b). However, relative to the enhancement observed with retroviruses, Aβ1–40 was substantially less efficient in enhancing HSV infection. This less pronounced ability of Aβ to enhance HSV infection may be a consequence of differences in accessibility or composition of the HSV lipid membrane. Here we describe an enhancement of enveloped virus infection by amyloidogenic APP proteolytic fragments Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42. The requirement that the Aβ fragments be present during the contact of the virus with the target cell suggests that a very early phase of infection is stimulated by the peptides. Enhancement of infection was observed for viruses containing several different envelope glycoproteins that utilize unrelated receptors, suggesting that enhancement does not require specific protein-protein interactions. Consistent with this, these peptides substantially enhanced the association of liposomes with cells. A common element among the viruses assayed in this study is the presence of a lipid envelope bilayer. It is therefore likely that the mechanism by which these peptides enhance entry includes their propensity to promote an interaction between the viral and cellular lipid membranes. The extent to which the reported membrane-destabilizing properties of Aβ participate in the observed enhancement of viral fusion remains unclear. The requirement for appropriate receptors on the target cell is not bypassed by Aβ, suggesting that receptor-triggered changes in the envelope glycoproteins are still crucial for achieving the fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. The entry enhancement observed herein is mediated by the precipitable amyloidogenic fraction of Aβ. Interestingly, other synthetic amyloidogenic peptides unrelated to Aβ similarly enhanced viral infection, whereas synthetic nonamyloidogenic peptides had no entry-enhancing effect. These results suggest that fibril formation may be important for the viral enhancement effect. Additional studies will be required to determine the other properties of amyloidogenic peptides that contribute to enhancement of virus infection. Our observations could have relevance to neuropathogenesis. Neuritic plaques, a primary component of which is Aβ, are more detectable in HIV-1-infected individuals than uninfected individuals (18Esiri M.M. Biddolph S.C. Morris C.S. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1998; 65: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Additionally, HIV-1-infected individuals are prone to an HIV-associated dementia that is correlated with high viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid (16Ellis R.J. Hsia K. Spector S.A. Nelson J.A. Heaton R.K. Wallace M.R. Abramson I. Atkinson J.H. Grant I. McCutchan J.A. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Brew B.J. Pemberton L. Cunningham P. Law M.G. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Immune cells, in particular microglia and macrophages, which are important target cells of HIV-1 in the brain, are commonly recruited to neuritic plaques (11Kaul M. Garden G.A. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2001; 410: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that regions of high Aβ, such as those in the vicinity of plaques, would be a highly favorable environment for virus transmission. It has been observed that sites of HIV-1 replication in the brain colocalize with sites of APP accumulation (12Adle-Biassette H. Chretien F. Wingertsmann L. Hery C. Ereau T. Scaravilli F. Tardieu M. Gray F. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1999; 25: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Nebuloni M. Pellegrinelli A. Ferri A. Bonetto S. Boldorini R. Vago L. Grassi M.P. Costanzi G. AIDS. 2001; 15: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), a possible consequence of HIV-1-induced neuronal injury. If high local APP levels also result in the production of Aβ, neuronal injury may both recruit immune cells and promote their infection. The observation of more frequent and severe HAD in individuals bearing the ApoE4 allele (20Corder E.H. Robertson K. Lannfelt L. Bogdanovic N. Eggertsen G. Wilkins J. Hall C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) is also consistent with a role for Aβ in HAD. Taken together with the data herein, these observations suggest that testing the effect of inhibitors of Aβ production in primate models of HAD (49Zink M.C. Suryanarayana K. Mankowski J.L. Shen A. Piatak Jr., M. Spelman J.P. Carter D.L. Adams R.J. Lifson J.D. Clements J.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is warranted. The infection of viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of VSV, A-MuLV, HIV-1, and HSV was enhanced by Aβ. It has been reported that HSV is detectable in a greater percentage of AD patients than in age-matched controls and that the combination of HSV and the ApoE4 allele disposes individuals to AD more than either factor alone (21Dobson C.B. Itzhaki R.F. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,22Itzhaki R.F. Lin W.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a contribution of HSV to the pathogenesis of AD. Although the enhancement of HSV by Aβ was significantly less pronounced than that observed for the two retroviruses studied, the possibility that an enveloped virus contributes to AD pathology merits further study. The magnitude of virus entry enhancement by these amyloidogenic peptides raises the possibility that the effect reported herein may be useful in applications such as gene therapy using viral vectors. Particularly in desirable target cells, viral titers and infection rates are frequently limiting. Aβ1–40 is less neurotoxic than Aβ1–42 (20Corder E.H. Robertson K. Lannfelt L. Bogdanovic N. Eggertsen G. Wilkins J. Hall C. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1182-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 50El-Agnaf O.M. Mahil D.S. Patel B.P. Austen B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), but under the conditions assayed, it is more potent in promoting infection. It is therefore possible that the ability of a peptide to promote infection is independent of its pathogenic properties. Experiments aimed at identifying synthetic peptides that promote infection with the same or greater efficiency as Aβ, but with lower cytotoxicity, are under way.

Na+/Ca2+ exchanger intracellular sodium cytoplasmic calcium 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid fractional steady-state current exchanger inhibitory peptide The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX)1 is an integral membrane protein found in nearly every cell type of the body where it plays an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis. Normally the NCX serves as a Ca2+ extrusion mechanism driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient. In cardiac muscle, for example, Ca2+ entering through L-type channels during the action potential is subsequently extruded by the NCX. However, it has also been shown that Ca2+ influx through the exchanger can occur under certain conditions (1Kohmoto O. Levi A.J. Bridge J.H.B. Circ.

The splicing process results in the mutually exclusive use of exons denoted A or B followed by the inclusion or exclusion in any combination of the cassette exons C to F (5Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A.

The two alternatively spliced isoforms used in this study are NCX1.3 and NCX1.4. NCX1.3, which is encoded by a transcript containing alternatively spliced exons B and D, is the predominant isoform expressed abundantly in the kidney and ubiquitously elsewhere. NCX1.4, encoded by transcripts including alternatively spliced exons A and D, and NCX1.5 (which contains exons A, D, and F) are the major isoforms expressed in neurons of the brain. Exon A encodes 35 amino acids (residues 601–635), while exon B encodes one less at 34 (residues 601–634). Exon D is relatively small encoding for 6 amino acids (GGFTLT). The specific physiological functions of the NCX1 alternatively spliced products are largely unknown.NCX activity is regulated in many different ways including by the ions it transports. Overall the rate of exchange is limited by the extent to which the different transport substrates saturate the ion translocation binding sites. However, NCX is also regulated allosterically by both transport substrates. Intracellular sodium (Na+i) regulates the NCX by inducing an inactive conformation in a process referred to as Na+i-dependent or I1 inactivation (10Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the absence of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (Ca2+i), the exchanger enters an inactive state in a process referred to as Ca2+i-dependent or I2 inactivation (11Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These two regulatory processes show interaction. For example, in the cardiac exchanger NCX1.1, I1 inactivation is alleviated if Ca2+i is sufficiently high.Recent studies using recombinant expression systems and in vitro assays have identified functional differences in the regulatory properties of NCX1 alternatively spliced isoforms. Heet al. (12He S. Ruknudin A. Bambrick L.L. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) compared rat NCX1.4 (containing alternatively spliced exons A and D) and NCX1.3 (containing exons B and D) inXenopus oocytes. They observed an increase of 39% in the activity of NCX1.4 upon activation by protein kinase A that was not seen for NCX1.3. Also two alternatively spliced NCX isoforms ofDrosophila melanogaster, Calx1.1 and Calx1.2, which differ by five amino acids at a position corresponding to the alternative splicing site of mammalian NCX1, show significant differences in their regulatory responses to Ca2+i and Na+i (13Omelchenko A.

Physiol. 1998; 111: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).One of our laboratories has recently identified ionic regulatory differences between the two NCX1 isoforms NCX1.4 and NCX1.3 (14Dyck C. Omelchenko A. Elias C.L. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Dycket al. (14Dyck C. Omelchenko A. Elias C.L. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) used outward exchange currents measured in giant excised patches from Xenopus oocytes to demonstrate that Na+i-dependent inactivation was alleviated by high Ca2+i in NCX1.4 but not in NCX1.3.In this study, we used the rat isoforms NCX1.3 and NCX1.4 to determine which amino acids contribute to the different regulatory properties of these exchangers. Using electrophysiological recordings we compared the functional properties of different isoforms and mutants and were able to identify two residues that are critical in conferring the unique regulatory properties for each isoform.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe rat NCX1.3 and NCX1.4 cDNAs were constructed as follows. The coding region of the NCX1.7 clone F1 (7Lee S.L., Yu, A.S. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14849-14852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was excised using theMunI and Bst1107I restriction sites located at nucleotides −24 and +2913, respectively, where +1 is the start of the NCX1 open reading frame. This fragment was made blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and ligated intoSmaI-digested pBluescript SKII− (Stratagene). The region encoding the large cytoplasmic loop of kidney NCX1.3 and brain NCX1.4 was obtained using reverse transcription-coupled PCR of kidney and brain mRNA, respectively. A BclI fragment (+812 to +2093) of this large cytoplasmic loop, which contained the NCX1.3- or NCX1.4-specific alternatively spliced region, was subsequently ligated into the BclI-digested pBluescript− NCX1.7 construct. The exchanger coding region was confirmed by sequencing and moved to the pcDNA3.1+ mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) usingHindIII and BamHI restriction sites.The chimeric constructs were produced by PCR overlap extension. The outer primer pair was named cd1 and cd2. Cd1 consisted of the sequence 5′-TTCGCTTGGGTTGCAGACAG-3′ from position +733 to +752. Cd2 was the reverse primer consisting of 5′-TGCATCACGTAATCAAAACAGG-3′ from position +2288 to +2267. The chimeric constructs A/B and B/A were prepared using NCX1.4 and NCX1.3 as templates. Specifically the A fragment in the A/B chimera was produced using the cd1 primer and a reverse primer with the exon A sequence at the site of chimerism and a 5′ tail of exon B sequence. The B fragment was similarly made using the cd2 reverse primer and a forward primer of exon B sequence with a 5′ exon A tail. These two fragments were annealed, extended, and then amplified using the outer primer pair. The B/A chimera was similarly prepared. The BAB chimera was produced using NCX1.4 and NCX1.3 as templates and three sets of primers. The outer primers were identical to those previously mentioned. The first region of exon B was produced using the cd1 outermost primer and an inner reverse primer with exon B sequence and an exon A overhang matching the sequence of exon A at the junction of BA in the BAB chimera. The small region of exon A was amplified using a set of primers that had overhanging ends that were of the exon B sequence. The third fragment of the chimera was produced using the outermost cd2 primer and an inner forward primer consisting of exon B sequence with a 5′ overhang matching the exon A sequence at the AB junction of the BAB chimera. All of the innermost primers were engineered so that the overhangs would anneal at the same temperature, which therefore made it feasible to perform the annealing/extension of the three fragments at the same time using five cycles of PCR. The outermost primers were then used to amplify the BAB fragment. The BA1B chimera contained a smaller region of exon A than the BAB chimera and was produced using the BAB chimera and NCX1.3 constructs as templates. The cd1 outermost primer was used with a reverse inner primer of exon A sequence with an exon B overhang matching the sequence of exon B at the A1B junction of the BA1B chimera. The cd2 outermost primer was used with a forward inner primer consisting of the exon B sequence with an overhang matching the exon A sequence at the A1B junction using NCX1.3 as template. These two fragments were then combined and allowed to anneal and extend for four PCR cycles followed by amplification using the outermost primers. The constructs with the individual point mutations were produced by an overlapping PCR technique where the innermost primers overlapped each other with the mutation included in the primer-overlapped region. The outermost primers were the same as those previously mentioned. All of the constructs that were produced by PCR were digested using AflII (nucleotide +988) andEheI (nucleotide +1993 for NCX1.4 or nucleotide +1990 for NCX1.3) and ligated into the pBluescript SKII-NCX1.4 or -NCX1.3 constructs, which were similarly digested. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing and then moved into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ with HindIII and BamHI digestion.All the constructed cDNAs in pcDNA3.1+ were linearized by digestion with the SmaI restriction enzyme, which cuts at a position 1396 nucleotides downstream of the end of the exchanger open reading frame in the pcDNA3.1+ vector. Following digestion, the linearized constructs were purified using the Qiaquick PCR Cleaning kit (Qiagen). cRNA was produced using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cRNAs were dissolved in 30–40 μl of RNA-grade water yielding a final concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. Xenopus laevis oocytes were then injected with 20–50 ng of the individual cRNAs.The oocytes were prepared as previously described (14Dyck C. Omelchenko A. Elias C.L. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Follicle-free stage V-VI oocytes were selected and incubated at 16 °C in secondary wash solution until injection the next day. Oocytes were used for electrophysiological recordings for 3–6 days following injection.The phenotypes of the different chimeras and site-specific mutants were compared by obtaining current traces using the giant excised patch-clamp technique as previously described (15Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Philipson K.D. J. Gen.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, borosilicate glass pipettes were pulled, and the tips were fire-polished to internal diameters of 20–30 μm. To increase seal stability and reduce electrical noise, the tips were coated in a ParafilmTM:mineral oil mixture. Prior to patching, the vitelline layer was dissected from the oocytes by first placing them in a shrinking solution containing 100 mm potassium aspartate, 100 mm KOH, 100 mm MES, 20 mmHEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0 at room temperature for 15 min. Once the vitelline layer had been removed the oocytes were placed into a solution containing 100 mm KOH, 100 mm MES, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 5–10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0 at room temperature. Gigaohm seals were formed with gentle suction, and the inside-out patches were removed carefully by movements of the micromanipulator. A custom-built 20-channel computer-controlled solution switcher was used for rapid solution switching. Data were acquired and analyzed using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) with Axotape and pClamp 6. To measure outward exchange currents the pipette solution contained 100 mmn-methyl-d-glucamine, 100 mmMES, 30 mm HEPES, 30 mmtetraethylammonium hydroxide, 8 mm CaCO3, 16 mm sulfamic acid, 6 mm KOH, 0.25 mmouabain, 0.1 mm niflumic acid, 0.1 mmflufenamic acid, pH 7.0 with MES at room temperature. To obtain outward exchange currents, the bath solutions were switched between Na+- and Li+-containing solutions: 100 mm Na+ or Li+ aspartate, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 0–9.91 mmCaCO3, 1–1.5 mm Mg(OH)2 adjusted to pH 7.0 with MES or LiOH. Ca2+ and Mg2+concentrations were adjusted using MAXC software (18Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) to yield free concentrations of 0–10 μm and 1.0 mm, respectively. Experiments were conducted at 30 ± 1 °C. Data are mean ± S.E. Fss, the fractional steady-state current, was calculated from the ratio of theoretical current level at infinite time (obtained from fitting current traces to a single exponential decay function) to the initial peak current. Fss values were compared, following a logarithmic conversion used to transform the data to a normal distribution, using one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey test used for post-test multiple comparisons (Instat 3.0a, GraphPad Software Inc.).Peptides were produced in the peptide synthesis core facility at the University of Calgary corresponding to the sequence of exon A from the chimera NCXBA1B and the corresponding region from exon B. These were called peptide A and B, respectively. The amino acid sequence of peptide A was IDDEEYEKNKTF and of peptide B was FDREEYEKECSF. Both peptides were found to be 98% pure by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. The peptides were applied in the bath, i.e. to the cytoplasmic surface of the exchanger, at a concentration of 25 μm.RESULTSThe objective of this study was to identify the amino acids responsible for the functional differences in ionic regulation observed between the two Na+/Ca2+ exchanger isoforms NCX1.3 and NCX1.4. Specifically, regulatory Ca2+ can alleviate Na+i-dependent inactivation in exon A-containing isoforms but not in those containing exon B as previously shown (14Dyck C. Omelchenko A. Elias C.L. Quednau B.D. Philipson K.D. Hnatowich M. Hryshko L.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) for canine NCX1.3 and NCX1.4. Here we examined the same isoforms from rat that also differ only in the region of alternative splicing due to distinct mutually exclusive exons A and B. These two exons contain numerous identities and similarities as shown in Fig. 1 with the majority of identical amino acids occurring in the first half. Several constructs were generated, and the corresponding cRNA was injected intoX. laevis oocytes. The giant excised patch-clamp technique was used to compare phenotypes between wild-type and mutant constructs.Fig. 2 shows the alleviation of Na+i-dependent inactivation at higher regulatory Ca2+ concentrations for the wild-type rat NCX1.4 but not for the NCX1.3 isoform. This illustrates the typical NCX1.4 phenotype, i.e. high exchange activity at high regulatory Ca2+i. These effects of regulatory Ca2+iwere also seen with the rat cardiac isoform NCX1.1 (data not shown). The current traces shown are representative single measurements. Summary data from several identical experiments for each construct are numerically compared in Fig. 4 using the fraction of steady-state to peak current (Fss) values. The Fss values obtained for the wild-type NCX1.4 and NCX1.3 isoforms at high (10 μm) Ca2+i were significantly different (0.84 ± 0.02 versus 0.09 ± 0.02, respectively,p < 0.001). At 1 μmCa2+i the Fss values obtained for NCX1.4 and NCX1.3 were 0.16 ± 0.02 versus 0.09 ± 0.01, respectively (no significant difference).Figure 2Representative current traces obtained for the wild-type and chimeric constructs. Outward exchange currents illustrating the so-called NCX1.4 phenotype (maintenance of exchanger activity under high Ca2+iconditions) and NCX1.3 phenotype are shown. Traces are also shown for the A/B, B/A, BAB, and BA1B chimeras. In each case a single patch excised from an oocyte expressing the indicated NCX1 construct was exposed sequentially to bath solutions containing increasing levels of [Ca2+]i as indicated, and currents were activated by application of 100 mmNa+i. Between current records, the bath solution was switched to a Li+-based solution containing the next level of [Ca2+]i to allow for recovery from inactivation. This was maintained for 30–40 s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Histogram of the Fss values for the different exchanger constructs at both 1 and 10 μmCa2+i.

Data are mean ± S.E. and represent the average of recordings from not less than four patches with a range of 6–58 determinations. *** corresponds to a significantly different result withp < 0.001 as compared with wild-type NCX1.4 under 10 μm Ca2+i conditions. * corresponds to a significant result with p < 0.05 as compared with wild-type NCX1.4 under 10 μmCa2+i conditions. ### represents a significant result (p < 0.001) as compared with wild-type NCX1.3 under 10 μmCa2+i conditions. ## represents a significant result with p < 0.01 as compared with wild-type NCX1.3 at 10 μmCa2+i. ∧ represents a significant result (p < 0.05) as compared with wild-type NCX1.3 at 1 μm Ca2+iconditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our first approach was to determine whether the residues involved in this functional difference were found in either the first or last half of exon A. Hence, two chimeras were produced. Chimera A/B consisted of the first 15 amino acids of exon A followed by the last 19 amino acids of exon B, and chimera B/A consisted of the first 15 amino acids of exon B followed by the final 20 amino acids of exon A. The current traces obtained from giant patches of oocytes injected with these mutant cRNAs are shown in Fig. 2. Neither chimera exhibited full exchange activity when exposed to high Ca2+i, i.e. both chimeras underwent Na+i-dependent inactivation to an extent not different from NCX1.3 and significantly greater than that observed for NCX1.4 (Fig. 4).This result suggested at least two possibilities. First, part of each half of exon A may be necessary for Ca2+i-mediated alleviation of Na+i-dependent inactivation. Alternatively, the critical region may be at the center of exon A and hence was destroyed in both chimeras. With this in mind, a second strategy was adopted in which the central region of exon B was replaced by the corresponding region of exon A. Chimera BAB consisted of residues 8–26 from exon A flanked by the exon B sequence (see Fig.1). The phenotype obtained for this chimera was similar to that of wild-type NCX1.4 as seen in Fig. 2. This result is confirmed by analysis of Fss as shown in Fig. 4. The value for Fss of the BAB chimera at 10 μm Ca2+iwas significantly different from NCX1.3 but not different from NCX1.4. Another chimera was then produced in which the central part of exon A was reduced to encompass only residues 8–19 surrounded by the exon B residues (chimera BA1B, see Fig. 1B). Again the current traces were similar to those seen with NCX1.4, and the Fss values were indistinguishable. These data suggested that residues in the small central region of exon A were responsible for the NCX1.4 phenotype. There are only five differences between exons A and B within this region, isoleucine to phenylalanine at position 8 (I8F), aspartic acid to arginine at position 10 (D10R), asparagine to glutamic acid at position 16 (N16E), lysine to cysteine at position 17 (K17C), and threonine to serine at position 18 (T18S). All point mutants are numbered from the beginning of either exon A or B (Fig. 1).Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change the exon A residues implicated in the NCX1.4 phenotype to match those of exon B one at a time. The first one chosen was the aspartic acid residue at position 10 of exon A, which was changed to an arginine (NCX1.4D10R). The currents obtained resembled an NCX1.3 phenotype rather than an NCX1.4 one,i.e. the suppression of Na+i-dependent inactivation by high Ca2+i was abolished. This can easily be seen in the current traces of Fig.3 and confirmed by comparing Fss values as shown in Fig. 4. The next mutation was from lysine at position 17 of exon A to a cysteine as in exon B (NCX1.4K17C). This mutation produced an intermediate phenotype as seen in the traces of Fig. 3 and in the Fss values that were lower than NCX1.4 and significantly different from NCX1.3 (Fig. 4). The third charge change in this small region of interest of exon A was asparagine to a glutamic acid (NCX1.4N16E). The currents and the resultant Fss values obtained with this mutant were not different from those of the wild-type NCX1.4 as seen in Fig. 4. Other point mutants that were examined include NCX1.4I8F, NCX1.4F20S, NCX1.4E22V, NCX1.4G24E, and NCX1.4K1 (removal of final lysine in exon A). None of these mutations significantly changed the NCX1.4 phenotype as is clear from the Fss data of Fig.4. These results indicate that the observed switch in phenotype was not due to just a change in the overall charge of this region but rather was due to specific residues within the central small portion. Thus, of the eight NCX1.4 exon A mutants tested, six had no effect, and the remaining two fully (D10R) or partially (K17C) converted NCX1.4 to an NCX1.3 phenotype.Figure 3Representative outward exchange current traces obtained for single mutants and the double mutant constructs. Outward exchange currents are shown elicited by application of 100 mmNa+i at different [Ca2+]i to excised patches from oocytes injected with the indicated mutant NCX1 cRNA. The single mutant NCX1.4D10R illustrates the conversion of the NCX1.4 phenotype to the corresponding NCX1.3 one, whereas the NCX1.3R10D mutant does not result in the converse change. The individual mutants are numbered relative to the first amino acid of exon A or B. See legend to Fig. 2 for further details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As phenotypic conversion occurred for the aspartic acid at position 10 and the lysine at position 17, the converse mutations were made in NCX1.3. The currents obtained using the arginine to aspartic acid at position 10 (NCX1.3R10D) point mutant were similar to those of NCX1.3 (Fig. 3), and the Fss values were not significantly different from those obtained with NCX1.3 (Fig. 4). Mutation of the cysteine at position 17 of exon B to lysine as in exon A (NCX1.3C17K) also resulted in currents and Fss values that were slightly different from NCX1.3 at least at 10 μm Ca2+i. However, the R10D,C17K double mutant in NCX1.3 (NCX1.3RDCK) yielded a phenotype with an Fss value at 10 μmCa2+i identical to that of NCX1.4 and significantly different from NCX1.3. Thus mutating just two residues of exon B restored the ability of high Ca2+i to suppress the process of Na+i-dependent inactivation.Interestingly the value of Fss for NCX1.3RDCK at 1 μmCa2+i was significantly higher than that of NCX1.4 (p < 0.001). Also, as can be seen in Fig. 3, there was some level of exchanger activity in the NCX1.3RDCK double mutant even in 0 Ca2+i, which was not seen in either wild-type exchanger. An increased Fss at 1 μm Ca2+i was also observed for several other mutants as evident in Fig. 4. Although we have no explanation for this behavior, it is clear these Fss values are still significantly lower than the corresponding values at 10 μm Ca2+i.To test the hypothesis that interaction of the critical portion of exon A with another site on the exchanger might be involved in the Ca2+i-mediated alleviation of Na+i-dependent inactivation, two peptides were produced corresponding to the small central region of exon A or B (amino acids 8–19; exon A, IDDEEYEKNKTF; exon B, FDREEYEKECSF). These peptides were added to the bath perfusate (cytosolic side of the patch) at 25 μm. Continual application of peptides A or B to either NCX1.3- or NCX1.4-expressing oocyte patches had no detectable effect on either Na+i-dependent inactivation itself or on the influence of Ca2+i on this process (data not shown).DISCUSSIONThe NCX1 isoforms are regulated in several ways including by the ions that they exchange (10Hilgemann D.W.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 11Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). One soluble receptor construct that worked particularly well in activating CheA was generated by fusing a leucine zipper dimerization domain to the NH2terminus of the cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain of Tar (termed lzTarC). Mixtures of lzTarC with CheW and CheA resulted in the efficient production of large, stable, roughly uniform structures with a composition of ∼28 lzTarC, 6 CheW, and 4 CheA chains (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we report an investigation of the molecular architecture of the highly active assemblies formed between lzTarC, CheA, and CheW. Results from electron microscopy, image processing, and immunogold labeling indicate a bipolar, barrel-like structure of staves formed from the coiled-coils of lzTarC. The leucine zipper portions of lzTarC extend from the ends of the barrel and CheA and CheW appear to be bound to the surface of the lzTarC barrel near the center of the longitudinal axis. The dimensions of the complex together with the known structures of its subunits have allowed the formulation of a low-resolution model of the complex. The results indicate that a higher order assembly involving multimeric receptor interactions may be required for receptor-mediated kinase CheA regulation during bacterial chemotaxis. CheA (13Stock A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar)) were purified as described previously. Ternary complexes of lzTarC·CheW·CheA were formed, purified, and characterized according to Liu et al. (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) except that high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration of the complex on a TSK-Gel G5000PWXL column was performed using an elution buffer lacking glycerol (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 25 mm NaCl, 5% Me2SO, pH 7.5) because of the interference of glycerol with the electron microscopy experiments. After removal of glycerol, the activity of the complex (measured as described in Ref.12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) decreased exponentially with a t 12 = 60 min; therefore aliquots of the complex peak fraction were immediately placed on microscope grids or incubated with antibodies for immunoelectron microscopy. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 199–345 mapping in the carboxyl terminal domain of the transcription factor C/EBP-β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blot analysis showed that these antibodies bind to lzTarC, possessing the leucine zipper sequence from C/EBP-β, but do not bind to the corresponding protein, Tar054, lacking the leucine zipper sequence (9Surette M.G. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Antibodies against CheA, CheW, CheY, and CheB were polyclonal; antibodies against CheY were affinity-purified on a column with immobilized CheY. Samples of 5 μl of lzTarC·CheW·CheA were applied to 400 mesh copper microscope grids covered by continuous carbon foils. The grids were washed with buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mmpotassium glutamate, 25 mm NaCl, 5% Me2SO, pH 7.5) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The grids were photographed with a Philips CM12 microscope (Philips Electronic Instruments Co., Mahwah, NJ) equipped with a Gatan model 626 cryostage and a model 651 anticontaminator (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) cooled to −170 °C. Images were recorded on SO163 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at ×60,000 magnification, and the dosage was limited to 20 electrons/Å2. Micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss SCAI Microdensitometer (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 7 μm and averaged over 3 × 3 arrays to give effectively a 21-μm raster, equivalent to 3.5 Angstroms per pixel. The software package SPIDER was used to average digitized images and to generate an image of the central section through the three-dimensional map of the averaged structure. lzTarc·CheW·CheA complexes, in some cases in the presence of CheY, were incubated with antibody for 5 min at room temperature. Protein A-gold (Auroprobe EM protein A G5, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) was added, and the solution was incubated for 5 min. A 3-μl sample was applied to a carbon film on a grid (see above). After 0.5–1.0 min, the grids were washed with buffer (see above) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were taken at ×45,000 on a Philips 301 electron microscope. From 98 to 212 images were analyzed for each experiment. We used very low antibody:complex ratios to achieve a clean background and minimize nonspecific interactions. In controls, antibodies raised against CheB, a chemotaxis protein that is not in the complexes, failed to decorate the complexes. Complexes between lzTarC, CheA, and CheW were produced and purified as described previously (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The histidine kinase activity per mol of CheA in these complexes was the same as the kinase activity per mol of CheA in receptor signaling complexes assayed under similar conditions (TableI). This corresponds to 100-fold activation over the activity exhibited by the purified CheA protein in the absence of receptors or CheW.Table ISpecific activity and activation of CheA in the lzTarc·CheW·CheA complex and complexes formed by the full-length membrane Tsr, CheW, and CheAType of complexSpecific activity1-aSpecific steady-state activity (turnover number) of the receptor-bound CheA dimers was measured using the spectroscopic assay as described previously (28) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 25 mm NaCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5.0% Me2SO, pH 7.5 (12).

Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the Tsr complexes were much better defined in terms of subunit stoichiometry and kinase molecular activity. Purified lzTarC·CheW·CheA complexes were examined by electron microscopy. Fig.1 A shows a typical field of images derived from these preparations. A set of 201 individual images of the complex in negative stain were aligned and averaged (Fig. 1,B and C). The appearance of the average (Fig.1 C) and indeed the individual images indicate that the complex is bipolar. The complex is 45 nm long by 15 nm wide. At the center of the complex is an 11 × 15-nm bulge. Extending axially from the bulge are 11-nm-long rods ending in a sharp disk of density. A 4 × 8-nm knob caps each end. Although the particles all sit on the grid with their long axis essentially in the plane of the grid, they present different views about the long axis. The average therefore combines views at different angles and approximately represents a projection of the cylindrically symmetric structure. From this average, we generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of the cylindrically averaged structure (16Stallmeyer M.J. Aizawa S. Macnab R.M. DeRosier D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 D shows a central slice through the reconstruction. The long axis of the complex appears darker than the surroundings, indicating a hollow, barrel-like assembly. Given that the lzTarC protein that was used to form the complexes is a rod-like tetramer structure (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and there are ∼28 lzTarC chains in each complex, the most likely rotational symmetry for the long axis of the complex is 7-fold, although 6- or 8-fold symmetries cannot be excluded. We have used antibodies against CheA, CheW, and the leucine zipper domain to localize these components. Additionally, in some experiments we added CheY, which binds to CheA, in combination with anti-CheY antibodies. Even though the fraction of decorated complexes was low, we were able to score from 98 to 212 antibody-decorated complexes for each of the decoration experiments. Fig. 2, A–C show representative images from typical experiments. Antibodies were decorated with protein A that has a 5-nm gold tag on a long (10–15 nm) tether. All antibodies were polyclonal and hence could potentially bind at multiple sites over the surface of a given subunit. Even with the variations in the positions of the gold tags, however, we could distinguish whether the leucine zippers were in the middle and CheA or CheW at the ends or vice versa. Given the range of possible distances from the gold tag to the epitope, we divided the structure into just the middle region and the end regions and scored each gold tag as to whether it lay at the ends (Fig. 2 A) or in the middle (Fig.2 B). About 15% of the tags lay near the boundary between the middle and the ends (Fig. 2 C). We classified these as undecided. Fig. 2 D is a histogram of our results given in percentages with the actual numbers of images counted in each category indicated at the ends of the bars. (Note that immunolabeling with the affinity purified antibodies against leucine zipper and CheY produced more clear-cut localization than labeling with antibodies against CheA or CheW.) It is clear from these results that, contrary to what was first surmised (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), CheA and CheW are positioned at the middle of the complex, and the leucine zippers of the receptor construct are at the ends. Electron microscopy and image analysis have provided a low resolution picture of the structure of complexes formed between lzTarC, CheA, and CheW. The major building block of these complexes, lzTarC, forms tetramers in solution (11Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), appearing as long thin rods in electron micrographs (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Since previous studies had indicated that receptors were dimeric (17Milligan D.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6268-6275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assumed, prior to the results reported here, that tetramer formation resulted from an association of the leucine zipper portion of the molecule (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This led Liu et al. (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) to propose a model wherein rod-like lzTarC coiled-coil dimers extended out from a central assembly of leucine zippers to form a barrel with CheW and CheA bound to the ends. The immunolabeling experiments described above have clearly established that this is not the case. Instead, the lzTarC subunits are oriented with the opposite polarity so that the region that binds CheW and CheA is located near the center of the barrel and the leucine zippers are at the ends. Cytoplasmic domain constructs of the receptor form tetramers when fused to completely different leucine zipper dimerization domains, from GCN4 (11Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and from C/EBP (12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This indicates that tetramer formation is a property of the receptor's cytoplasmic domain rather than the leucine zipper, and it is likely that these structural arrangements also occur in vivo. Despite considerable effort by several groups, there have been only two types of soluble receptor constructs that have led to the formation of complexes with CheA and CheW with high levels of histidine kinase activity. The first type, exemplified by lzTarc, has a leucine zipper dimerization domain fused to the NH2terminus of the cytoplasmic coiled-coil domain (9Surette M.G. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The second type is comprised solely of sequences from the cytoplasmic domain. In the latter case, however, a portion of the receptor corresponding to about half of the α-helix that forms the second antiparallel strand of the coiled-coil (α2) is deleted (9Surette M.G. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This deletion leaves the NH2-terminal half of the first α-helix (α1) without a partner. In the absence of its normal partner, this NH2-terminal region would be expected to form a homodimeric parallel α1-α1 coiled-coil similar to the NH2-terminal homodimeric coiled coil provided by the leucine zipper adducts. All of these receptor constructs produced active complexes that appeared to be very large structures comprised of numerous receptor subunits (10Ames P. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6340-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Liu Y. Levit M. Lurz R. Surette M. Stock J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7231-7240Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that formation of a homodimeric parallel α1-α1 coiled-coil greatly facilitates formation of active receptor-kinase complexes. The crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of Tsr indicates a dimer formed by supercoiling of monomeric antiparallel α1-α2 coiled coils (7Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dimerization resulting from formation of the α1-α1 coiled-coil would produce a supercoiled structure with the antiparallel α2-helices folding back to lie on opposing hydrophobic surfaces between the parallel α1-α1 coiled-coils, as has been concluded from the cysteine and disulfide scanning studies (18Danielson M.A. Bass R.B. Falke J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32878-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Presumably, the function of the leucine zipper is to favor this type of coiled-coil interaction. The aspartate receptor cytoplasmic domain is highly dynamic (19Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike a structure originating from dimeric interaction between antiparallel coils, the antiparallel strands in the leucine zipper-induced dimer could easily dissociate and participate in interactions with other dimers (20Stock J. Da Re S. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such helix swapping interaction could account for the rod-like tetramers formed by lzTarC alone (Fig.3). Helix swapping between receptors in the membrane would provide a mechanism whereby each receptor dimer could have interactions with up to four neighbor dimers. These types of interactions would contribute to the formation of the extensive receptor clusters that have been observed in intact cells (21Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 22Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Gestwicki J.E. Kiessling L.L. Nature. 2002; 415: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Given our low resolution picture of the lzTarC·CheW·CheA complex and the general organization of the components, we ask how the component parts fit into the structure. A bipolar barrel formed from the four-helix bundles like those depicted in Fig. 3 would generate a structure with an outer diameter of 8 nm, which fits well with the observed width of the rod portion of the complex (Fig. 4). The expected length of these four-helix bundles is 19 nm; the length of the leucine zipper is ∼6.5 nm (43 amino acid residues); the length of the 7-amino acid flexible linker that connects the zipper to the cytoplasmic domain is 1–2 nm. The COOH-terminal ends have an additional 35 residues not present in the atomic model of the receptor structure. Fig. 4 shows a model that can account for images of the receptor constructs. In it, the COOH-terminal ends form the sharp disk of density, and the leucine zippers form the knobs at the ends of the complex. The long four-helix bundles make up the rod-like features seen in the images. The four-helix bundles, which are 19 nm in length, are about 1.5 nm longer than the corresponding dimension measured in the image. This discrepancy may be accounted for if there is a slight shrinkage in negative stain. Shrinkage in negative stain is well known and can exceed the 10% suggested here (24Unwin P.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25DeRosier D.J. Tilney L.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1984; 15: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The long dimension of the CheA dimer is ∼12 nm (27Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This distance fits well with the dimensions of the central part in the soluble complex (Fig. 4). CheW is much smaller than CheA and can easily fit into this region since it is likely to bind to the same sites as CheA (28Levit M.N. Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most of the previous literature assumes that the functional receptor unit is a dimer. This conclusion derives almost entirely from x-ray crystallographic studies of the periplasmic sensing domain. The isolated aspartate-binding domain of Tar is a symmetric dimer of two four-helix bundles with aspartate-binding sites bridging the dimer interface (29Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Prive G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These results with the periplasmic domain cannot be used to infer the structure of the cytoplasmic portions of the receptor. Indeed, in vitro studies of this domain have indicated a variety of quaternary states ranging from loosely folded monomers to large aggregates (30Long D.G. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9904-9911Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The dimeric models of the intact receptors that have been advanced previously are composites formed by joining the dimeric unit from the x-ray crystal structure of a fragment of the cytoplasmic domain of Tsr, with the crystal structure of the Tar aspartate-binding domain dimer (7Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this type of model the cytoplasmic domain is generally represented as a well defined dimeric structure, but in the crystal of the Tsr cytoplasmic domain fragment there are numerous higher order interactions as well, and the unit cell is essentially a trimer of dimers (7Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Another assumption of the model is that the transmembrane and linker regions are directly connected by a continuous α-helical domain extending from the periplasmic dimer at the outside surface of the membrane to the coiled-coil dimer in the cytoplasm. There is evidence, however, that the linker region is a distinct domain in its own right and is not completely α-helical (5Wolanin P.W. Stock J.B. Inouye M. Dutta R. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York2002: 73-122Google Scholar,31Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is now well established that most of the several thousand chemotaxis receptor subunits in E. coli are localized together with CheA and CheW in one or two tight clusters, generally at the poles of the cell (21Maddock J.R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 259: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 22Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 33Gestwicki J.E. Lamanna A.C. Harshey R.M. McCarter L.L. Kiessling L.L. Adler J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6499-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although CheA and CheW are essential for optimal cluster formation, the receptors are capable of extensive higher order interactions that function to initiate cluster assembly (34Lybarger S.R. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The structure of our soluble receptor signaling complexes provides clues as to how receptor clusters may assemble. The process could be initiated by interactions between monomeric antiparallel coiled-coil chains coming together to form dimers and higher order structures like the trimers of dimers that are seen in the x-ray crystal structure of the isolated Tsr coiled-coil domain (7Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). At some stage the intrasubunit antiparallel coiled-coil interactions could be converted to intersubunit parallel α1-α1 coiled-coils with antiparallel interactions between subunits like those that appear to underlie the tetrameric structure as depicted in Fig. 3. CheA and CheW binding might facilitate this transition to help organize the receptor structures into higher order assemblies. The two receptor-binding domains of CheA are separated by 8 nm (19Bass R.B. Falke J.J. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 829-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which is sufficient to bridge between two tetramers. The linker domain at the membrane-cytoplasm interface would mediate sensory interactions between the transmembrane sensory portions of the receptor and the underlying coiled-coil scaffold. How does this relate to the mechanism of transmembrane signaling? Models have been advanced suggesting that higher order receptor interactions could account for the extremely high sensitivity ofE. coli to very small changes in attractant concentrations (23Gestwicki J.E. Kiessling L.L. Nature. 2002; 415: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 35Bray D. Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J.

It has also been shown that different classes of receptors interact with one another to effect adaptive responses to long term changes in background stimulation (38Feng X. Baumgartner J.W. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Weerasuriya S. Schneider B.M. Manson M.D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 914-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A highly ordered array of numerous different receptors provides a much greater potential for information processing than would a corresponding number of independently functioning receptors scattered over the cell surface. The cytoplasmic signaling domains of chemotaxis receptors are highly conserved in virtually all motile prokaryotes, but the periplasmic sensing domains are highly variable (5Wolanin P.W. Stock J.B. Inouye M. Dutta R. Histidine Kinases in Signal Transduction. Academic Press, New York2002: 73-122Google Scholar). There are, for instance, no known homologues of the Tar sensing domain in any bacterium aside from species closely related to E. coli. Even homologous periplasmic sensing domains in E. coli have little sequence identity. Given this diversity, it is unlikely that a specific change in sensing domain conformation provides a general mechanism to regulate the receptor-signaling network inside the cell. Instead, one would expect that any number of subtle stimulus-induced changes could cooperate to significantly perturb the dynamic architecture of the signaling array to produce a response. Transmembrane signaling could be accomplished by a variety of different conformational changes in sensory domain structure that lead to altered packing interactions within a compact sensory array at the periplasmic surface of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2315014732,"In recent years a growth inhibitory role in skin for the Rel/NF-κB transcription factors has been established, and the block of Rel/NF-κB signaling results in rapid development of spontaneous skin cancer. The molecular mechanism underlying tumor development is however unknown. In the present study, we show that inhibition of NF-κB signaling in mouse skin by targeted expression of degradation resistant IκB-α generates transgenic keratinocytes unable to arrest the cell cycle in response to DNA damage induced by γ-radiation. The results indicate that transgenic keratinocytes have a defect at the G1-S checkpoint whereas the G2-M checkpoint response was found to be intact. However, transgenic keratinocytes still respond by induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf after exposure to γ-radiation. In the spontaneous skin tumors that develop in transgenic mice no mutations were found in the Ha-ras or p53 gene, suggesting that inhibition of NF-κB signaling in skin can induce cancer development independently of initiating mutations in the Ha-ras gene or additional mutations in the p53 gene. These findings demonstrate an involvement of NF-κB signaling in the DNA damage response and cell cycle checkpoint control in the skin."

The τ2 domain (residues 526–556 in hGR or 544–573 in rGR) possesses transactivation potential in the context of full-length GR (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol.

A, H4IIE cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of the PEPCK-LUC reporter construct (the PEPCK gene promoter encompassing nucleotides −467 to +65 relative to the transcription start site, ligated to the luciferase reporter gene) and 2.5 μg of either a GR expression plasmid or an empty RSV-neo vector. Cells were treated with 1 nmDex for 18 h in serum-free DMEM and harvested for the assay of luciferase activity. The GR expression vectors used are as follows: coGR, the C656G GR mutant;menh2, the triple mutation E219K,F220L,W234R;denh2, the deletion 106–318 of the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain;mtau2, the S573A mutation; mAF2, the E773A mutation. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of at least five experiments. The asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) from coGR.Panel B shows that the C656G GR AF2 mutants are expressed equally. The C656G GR and the corresponding AF2 GR mutants (40 μg) were transfected into COS cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with GR antibodies for GR immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two conditions had to be met in order to study the exact contribution of the three transactivation domains of GR to PEPCK gene transcription: 1) the contribution of the endogenous GR in H4IIE hepatoma cells used for analyzing GC-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription had to be eliminated; and 2) GR mutations that disrupt the transactivation potential of each TAD, while maintaining the ligand and DNA binding properties of GR, had to be constructed. In this study we employed a system that eliminates the influence of the endogenous GR by using GR C656G (31Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant receptor is maximally activated by glucocorticoids at 500 times less ligand than is required for activation of the endogenous, wild type GR, thereby eliminating the influence of the latter. We used this system and a series of mutations of C656G GR to demonstrate the unique importance of the AF2 domain for induction of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids.DISCUSSIONThree cysteine residues (Cys640, Cys656, and Cys661) are involved in the GR-ligand interaction. The point mutations C640S and C661S each reduces the affinity of glucocorticoid binding to GR. Surprisingly, mutation C656G increases the affinity of the GR for its ligand and also activates transcription at a lower ligand concentration (31Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we show in this study, half-maximal activation of expression from a PEPCK gene promoter-driven reporter construct in H4IIE cells is achieved at a 500-fold lower ligand concentration when C656G GR is used. Because significant activation occurs at 1 nm Dex, a concentration at which wild type GR is inactive vis-′a-vis the PEPCK gene, one can bypass the endogenous, wild type GR and thereby analyze the function of different regions of a transfected GR (Fig. 1).Two hGR domains, referred to as τ1 and τ2, are necessary for activation of transcription but are not specifically involved in either steroid or DNA binding (9Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These hGR transactivation domains were defined according to two criteria: 1) deletion of the domain decreases activity and 2) duplication of the domain increases activity (12Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We show that deletion of the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain in rGR (Fig. 2) does not decrease the activation of PEPCK gene transcription promoted by glucocorticoids. This observation does not speak against the transactivation function of this domain but rather speaks for the fact that different activation surfaces of GR are employed in different GRE and promoter contexts. For example, deletion of the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain in the rGR does not affect the activation of the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter, but this mutation completely abrogates the activation of the MMTV-LTR promoter by hormone (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Distinct GR surfaces also mediate the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of glucocorticoids (43Rogatsky I. Hittelman A.B. Pearce D. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5036-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Three amino acid substitutions in the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain (E219K, F220L, W234R) selectively disrupt the activation function of this N-terminal TAD in GR (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This triple mutation does not influence PEPCK gene transcription (Fig. 2), and hence GC regulation of the PEPCK gene must be conferred by one or both of the C-terminal TADs. The hinge region of steroid receptors, which includes the τ2 domain, interacts with the general transcription factor, TAFII30, in vitro(44Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and a novel coactivator, L7/SPA, in vivo (45Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but no evidence exists for the interaction of the τ2 domain with the p160 coactivator family (SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and p/CIP) (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar). S573A in rGR is homologous to S561A in mGR that causes a loss of transactivation activity in the minimum τ2 fragment and the full-length GR (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of the τ2 transactivation domain by point mutation S573A also does not diminish the activation of PEPCK gene (Fig. 2). By contrast, a point mutation, E773A (mAF2), in the AF2 transactivation domain, which is known to interact with coactivators, does decrease the response of the PEPCK reporter gene to Dex by 70%. However, the mAF2 GR does not affect activation of transcription through a PEPCK promoter construct that contains a palindromic GRE in the place of GR1. It is noteworthy that this replacement relieves the requirement for gAF1 and gAF3 (5Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.E. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These accessory factor elements bind HNF4/COUP-TF and COUP-TF, respectively, an interaction that affects the affinity and stability of GR binding to GR1, and thus perhaps influence the interaction of SRC-1 with GR (46Stafford J.M. Wilkinson J.C. Beechem J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39885-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The palindromic GRE may therefore present a surface of GR that is sufficient, in itself, to interact with SRC-1.Although it is known that the AF2 domain of GR is involved in the interaction with SRC-1 in vivo (28Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GR residue(s) necessary for this interaction are unknown. We show here that the GR·SRC-1 interaction is interrupted when the E773A mutation is introduced into the GR (Fig. 6). There is specificity to this reaction because another AF2 mutation, Y753F, which displays reduced activation of the MMTV promoter (42Ray D.W. Suen C.S. Brass A. Soden J. White A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), has no influence on the GR·SRC-1 interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 5).In this study we further demonstrate the utility of using C656G GR to eliminate the function of endogenous GR. This Dex-sensitive GR allowed us to identify the transactivation domains of GR necessary for transcription of the PEPCK gene, which was heretofore not possible. Instead of possessing high affinity GREs, the PEPCK gene promoter has two low affinity GR binding sites, GR1 and GR2, and thus requires accessory factor activity to stabilize GR binding and to recruit coactivators to the promoter. We have identified a residue, Glu773, that directs the interaction of GR with SRC-1 in the context of the PEPCK gene promoter. Mutation of this residue does not disrupt activation of the PEPCK gene if the low affinity GR1 site is changed to a high affinity, palindromic GRE. These data suggest that a context-dependent conformation of GR is essential for the recruitment of SRC-1 to the PEPCK gene promoter and efficient glucocorticoid-mediated induction of this gene. Glucocorticoids (GCs)1play a central role in carbohydrate metabolism by increasing glucose production, decreasing glucose tolerance, and causing insulin resistance (1Sapolsky R.M. Romero L.M. Munck A.U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5378) Google Scholar). GCs increase glucose production primarily by inducing the transcription of genes that encode gluconeogenic enzymes, including PEPCK, a rate-determining enzyme of gluconeogenesis. GCs increase the rate of transcription of the PEPCK gene by ∼10-fold (2Granner D. Pilkis S. J. Biol.

An additional region involved in transactivation, AF2, has been mapped (see Fig.2 A, inset) (13Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G.

The τ2 and AF2 domains are both located in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in the C-terminal regions of GR. The τ1 domain (also referred to as enh2 or AF-1; residues 77–262 in hGR or 106–318 in rat GR (rGR)) is located in the N-terminal region of the GR molecule and is generally considered a major region responsible for transactivation. τ1 makes contact with proteins in the basal transcriptional apparatus, including the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), possibly through an intermediary adapter protein(s) (16McEwan I.J.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The τ1 domain is highly acidic and phosphorylated (19Almlof T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Bodwell J.E. Webster J.C. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A., Hu, J.M. Munck A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24737-24741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The τ2 domain (residues 526–556 in hGR or 544–573 in rGR) possesses transactivation potential in the context of full-length GR (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear matrix targeting activity (23Tang Y. Getzenberg R.H. Vietmeier B.N. Stallcup M.R. Eggert M. Renkawitz R. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1420-1431PubMed Google Scholar), and a binding domain for hsp90 (24Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The C-terminal AF2 domain (sometimes called τc; residues 727–763 in hGR (25McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or 745–781 in rGR, determined also as 752–758 in hGR (26Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)) forms part of the amphipathic α-helix 12 of the ligand binding domain and is responsible for the hormone-dependent interaction with coactivators of the p160 family, e.g. SRC-1 (27Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2042) Google Scholar, 28Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction with coactivators may occur because of the conformational change AF2 undergoes upon ligand binding (29Renaud J.P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 30Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), but the exact residues have not been defined. Two conditions had to be met in order to study the exact contribution of the three transactivation domains of GR to PEPCK gene transcription: 1) the contribution of the endogenous GR in H4IIE hepatoma cells used for analyzing GC-stimulated PEPCK gene transcription had to be eliminated; and 2) GR mutations that disrupt the transactivation potential of each TAD, while maintaining the ligand and DNA binding properties of GR, had to be constructed. In this study we employed a system that eliminates the influence of the endogenous GR by using GR C656G (31Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant receptor is maximally activated by glucocorticoids at 500 times less ligand than is required for activation of the endogenous, wild type GR, thereby eliminating the influence of the latter. We used this system and a series of mutations of C656G GR to demonstrate the unique importance of the AF2 domain for induction of the PEPCK gene by glucocorticoids. DISCUSSIONThree cysteine residues (Cys640, Cys656, and Cys661) are involved in the GR-ligand interaction. The point mutations C640S and C661S each reduces the affinity of glucocorticoid binding to GR. Surprisingly, mutation C656G increases the affinity of the GR for its ligand and also activates transcription at a lower ligand concentration (31Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons S.S., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As we show in this study, half-maximal activation of expression from a PEPCK gene promoter-driven reporter construct in H4IIE cells is achieved at a 500-fold lower ligand concentration when C656G GR is used. Because significant activation occurs at 1 nm Dex, a concentration at which wild type GR is inactive vis-′a-vis the PEPCK gene, one can bypass the endogenous, wild type GR and thereby analyze the function of different regions of a transfected GR (Fig. 1).Two hGR domains, referred to as τ1 and τ2, are necessary for activation of transcription but are not specifically involved in either steroid or DNA binding (9Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These hGR transactivation domains were defined according to two criteria: 1) deletion of the domain decreases activity and 2) duplication of the domain increases activity (12Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). We show that deletion of the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain in rGR (Fig. 2) does not decrease the activation of PEPCK gene transcription promoted by glucocorticoids. This observation does not speak against the transactivation function of this domain but rather speaks for the fact that different activation surfaces of GR are employed in different GRE and promoter contexts. For example, deletion of the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain in the rGR does not affect the activation of the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter, but this mutation completely abrogates the activation of the MMTV-LTR promoter by hormone (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Distinct GR surfaces also mediate the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of glucocorticoids (43Rogatsky I. Hittelman A.B. Pearce D. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5036-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Three amino acid substitutions in the enh2/τ1/AF1 domain (E219K, F220L, W234R) selectively disrupt the activation function of this N-terminal TAD in GR (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This triple mutation does not influence PEPCK gene transcription (Fig. 2), and hence GC regulation of the PEPCK gene must be conferred by one or both of the C-terminal TADs. The hinge region of steroid receptors, which includes the τ2 domain, interacts with the general transcription factor, TAFII30, in vitro(44Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and a novel coactivator, L7/SPA, in vivo (45Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 693-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), but no evidence exists for the interaction of the τ2 domain with the p160 coactivator family (SRC-1, GRIP1/TIF2, and p/CIP) (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar). S573A in rGR is homologous to S561A in mGR that causes a loss of transactivation activity in the minimum τ2 fragment and the full-length GR (22Milhon J. Lee S. Kohli K. Chen D. Hong H. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1795-1805PubMed Google Scholar). The disruption of the τ2 transactivation domain by point mutation S573A also does not diminish the activation of PEPCK gene (Fig. 2). By contrast, a point mutation, E773A (mAF2), in the AF2 transactivation domain, which is known to interact with coactivators, does decrease the response of the PEPCK reporter gene to Dex by 70%. However, the mAF2 GR does not affect activation of transcription through a PEPCK promoter construct that contains a palindromic GRE in the place of GR1. It is noteworthy that this replacement relieves the requirement for gAF1 and gAF3 (5Scott D.K. Stromstedt P.E. Wang J.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These accessory factor elements bind HNF4/COUP-TF and COUP-TF, respectively, an interaction that affects the affinity and stability of GR binding to GR1, and thus perhaps influence the interaction of SRC-1 with GR (46Stafford J.M. Wilkinson J.C. Beechem J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39885-39891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The palindromic GRE may therefore present a surface of GR that is sufficient, in itself, to interact with SRC-1.Although it is known that the AF2 domain of GR is involved in the interaction with SRC-1 in vivo (28Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the GR residue(s) necessary for this interaction are unknown. We show here that the GR·SRC-1 interaction is interrupted when the E773A mutation is introduced into the GR (Fig. 6). There is specificity to this reaction because another AF2 mutation, Y753F, which displays reduced activation of the MMTV promoter (42Ray D.W. Suen C.S. Brass A. Soden J. White A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), has no influence on the GR·SRC-1 interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 5).In this study we further demonstrate the utility of using C656G GR to eliminate the function of endogenous GR. This Dex-sensitive GR allowed us to identify the transactivation domains of GR necessary for transcription of the PEPCK gene, which was heretofore not possible. Instead of possessing high affinity GREs, the PEPCK gene promoter has two low affinity GR binding sites, GR1 and GR2, and thus requires accessory factor activity to stabilize GR binding and to recruit coactivators to the promoter. We have identified a residue, Glu773, that directs the interaction of GR with SRC-1 in the context of the PEPCK gene promoter. Mutation of this residue does not disrupt activation of the PEPCK gene if the low affinity GR1 site is changed to a high affinity, palindromic GRE. These data suggest that a context-dependent conformation of GR is essential for the recruitment of SRC-1 to the PEPCK gene promoter and efficient glucocorticoid-mediated induction of this gene. Three cysteine residues (Cys640, Cys656, and Cys661) are involved in the GR-ligand interaction. The point mutations C640S and C661S each reduces the affinity of glucocorticoid binding to GR.

In principle, this activity is required in the nucleoplasm for mRNA synthesis and in the nucleoli for rRNA synthesis. Yet, topoisomerase I is mostly a nucleolar protein. Current belief holds that this preference is triggered by the N-terminal domain of the enzyme, which constitutes a nucleolar import signal. Contradicting this view, we show here that nucleolar accumulation of various fragments of topoisomerase I is correlated with their lesser mobility in this compartment and not with the N-terminal domain being intact or present. Therefore, the N-terminal domain is not likely a nucleolar import signal. We show that it rather serves as an adaptor that anchors a subpopulation of topoisomerase I at fibrillar centers of nucleoli and nucleolar organizer regions of mitotic chromosomes. Thus, it provides a steady association of topoisomerase I with the rDNA and with RNA polymerase I, which is maintained in a living cell during the entire cell cycle.

DNA topoisomerase I changes the pitch of DNA helices by cutting one DNA strand and allowing rotation of the other (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). One important role for this mechanism is the release of torsion stress created by DNA transcription. Thus, topoisomerase I activity should in principle be required in the nucleoplasm for the synthesis of mRNA, and in the nucleolus for the synthesis of rRNA. However, the latter task seems to dominate. During interphase, most of topoisomerase I is located in the nucleoli and not in the nucleoplasm, although the enzyme interchanges constantly between these two compartments (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that nucleolar accumulation of topoisomerase I reflects engagement in rDNA-transcription because the rRNA genes are by far the most heavily transcribed genes in the cell. In keeping with this, studies of genomic DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I have invariantly come up with sites in the rDNA (3Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, catalytic interactions with rDNA cannotper se account for the accumulation of topoisomerase I in the nucleoli because stabilization of covalent topoisomerase I·DNA intermediates by camptothecin immobilizes the enzyme preferentially at nucleoplasmatic sites and only to a much lesser extent in the nucleoli (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Along this reasoning the question arises of what restricts topoisomerase I in the nucleolus and how is this phenomenon related to rDNA processing. We show here that in a living cell a sub population of topoisomerase I is constantly anchored at the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus or the nucleolar organizer region of mitotic chromosomes and that this is due to an adaptor function of the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. GFP1 chimera of human topoisomerase I and of various fragments of it (see Fig.3 A) were stably expressed in the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) using the bicistronic expression vector pMC-2P (6Mielke C. Tummler M. Schubeler D. von Hoegen I. Hauser H. Gene. 2000; 254: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in which the translational initiation of the selection marker puromycin-N-acetyl transferase in the second cistron is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site from poliovirus. The coding sequence for GFP was inserted (HindIII/EcoRI) in front of the internal ribosome entry site by linker PCR using pEGFP (CLONTECH) as a template. Unless GFP alone was to be expressed, the stop codon of GFP was replaced withMluI/ApaI restriction sites to allow for in-frame fusions to PCR-generated coding sequences of human topoisomerase I, topoisomerase IPhe723, or various fragments of human topoisomerase I. Whenever such fragments were lacking the endogenous nuclear localization signal sequences of topoisomerase I (i.e. TI175–765, TI190–765, TI210–765, and TI1–133 (see Fig. 3 A)), cloning was done with PCR-primers supplemented with the nuclear localization signal of SV40. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen) and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell lines were selected after 2 days with 0.35 μg ml−1 of puromycin and maintained under selection. Cells expressing the various GFP chimera in a constitutive manner were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and lysed by addition of an equal volume of 2-fold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 8m urea, 20% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 10 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg ml−1of aprotinin, and 10 μg ml−1 of pepstatin A. Lysates equivalent to 5 × 105 cells were applied to each slot of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were subsequently blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (167 mmNaCl, 25.5 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) and then incubated for 1 h in the same buffer with rabbit peptide antibodies against the last 18 C-terminal amino acid residues of human topoisomerase I (Genosys, Cambridge, UK) or with mouse monoclonal GFP antibodies (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany). After washing, the filters were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies diluted with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Following extensive washing with the same buffer, labeled protein bands were finally visualized with the ECL Plus system (AmershamBiosciences). Fig. 1 summarizes representative results. GFP chimera of full-length topoisomerase I, topoisomerase IPhe723, and the various N-terminally truncated fragments were separated in 8% gels. Western blots of these constructs were probed with GFP antibodies (Fig. 1 A,bottom) as well as with topoisomerase I antibodies (Fig.1 A, bottom). GFP chimera of the various N-terminal fragments were separated in 12% gels. Probing of these blots with topoisomerase I antibodies was not meaningful because none of these constructs contained the C-terminal epitope targeted by the antibody used here, and antibodies targeting an epitope of topoisomerase I preserved in all these fragments are not available. Thus, the latter blots were just probed with GFP antibodies (Fig.1 B). The top panel in Fig. 1 A, which was probed with topoisomerase I antibodies, shows that expression of GFP-topoisomerase I (lane 2, upper band) and GFP-topoisomerase IPhe723 (lane 3, upper band) was similar to that of endogenous topoisomerase I in the same cells (corresponding lower bands). Moreover, comparison with untransfected 293 cells (lane 1) shows that expression levels of endogenous topoisomerase I were not altered by the additional expression of the GFP constructs (compare the lower bands inlanes 1–3). The size of the GFP-fused, N-terminally truncated fragments (lanes 4–7) was too similar to endogenous topoisomerase to allow a reliable discrimination. However, in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 A, which was probed with GFP antibodies, it can be seen clearly that a single band of the expected size was obtained for each of these GFP constructs and that expression levels of the N-terminally truncated fragments was in the same range as that of full-length GFP-topoisomerase I. The same holds true for the N-terminal fragments shown in Fig. 1 B. Thus, it could be concluded that (i) the GFP chimera were not heavily overexpressed, (ii) the chimeric genes were not rearranged, (iii) green fluorescence of the cells could be unambiguously assigned to constitutive expression of the intended proteins, and (iv) data obtained with the various constructs could be expected to be comparable with each other. Fluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted epifluorescence microscope. For confocal imaging and for measurements of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we used a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. Both microscopes were equipped with a heated cell chamber (Bioptechs Inc., Butler, Pennsylvania) and a heated 63×/1.4 NA oil immersion objective, allowing culturing of the cells under the microscope at 37 °C. For FRAP measurements, fluorescent images of a single optical section were taken at 1.6-s time intervals before (n = 5) and after bleaching of a circular area at 20 mW nominal laser power with three iterations. Imaging scans were acquired with the laser power attenuated to 0.1–1% of the bleaching intensity. For quantitative analysis of FRAP, fluorescence intensities of the bleached region and of the entire cell nucleus were measured at each time point. Data were corrected for extracellular background intensity and for the overall loss in total intensity resulting from the bleach pulse itself and from the imaging scans. The relative intensity of the bleached area I rel was calculated according to Ref.7Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar. It should be emphasized that all microscopic data presented here were obtained with cells living under the microscope at 37 °C. Morphology and mobility of GFP-topoisomerase I was different when observed at 20 °C or when native cell specimen were mounted in 50% glycerol as done in previous studies (8Mo Y.Y. Wang C. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Mo Y.Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Mo Y.Y., Yu, Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Mao Y. Okada S. Chang L.S. Muller M.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4538-4543PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is demonstrated in Fig.2. At 37 °C GFP-topoisomerase I exhibited a granular pattern in the nucleoli and a homogenous one of much lesser intensity in the nucleoplasm (Fig. 2 A, top row). Upon transfer of the cells to ambient temperature, the granular pattern in the nucleoli was progressively lost over time and replaced with a homogeneous one, whereas the nucleoplasmatic pattern became inhomogeneous and, moreover, interspersed with enzyme aggregates that were not apparent at 37 °C (Fig. 2 A, comparerows 2–4 with row 1). Upon mounting the cells in 50% glycerol, GFP-topoisomerase I became redistributed from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm to such an extent that it appeared evenly distributed between the two compartments (Fig. 1 A, row 5) or even excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 2 A,row 6). Fig. 2 B demonstrates the effect of lowering the temperature on the mobility of GFP-topoisomerase I. FRAP kinetics in the nucleoplasm (top) was clearly slower at ambient temperature than at 37 °C (compare circles withtriangles). This effect was even more pronounced in mitotic chromosomes where FRAP was rapid and complete at 37 °C, whereas it was much slower and incomplete at ambient temperature (Fig.2 B, bottom, compare circles andtriangles). Thus, topoisomerase I seems not to conform to the widely accepted working hypothesis that the mobility of nuclear proteins is the same at ambient temperature and at 37 °C (7Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed advisable to study this protein at 37 °C and to control this experimental condition in a stringent manner. For immunostaining of RNA polymerase I, fibrillarin, and nucleolin, cells were grown on microscopic glass slides, permeabilized (0.07% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 s at 37 °C), and then fixed with PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min, 4 °C). All subsequent steps were carried out at ambient temperature. After washing with PBS, the cell samples were blocked for 1 h with PBS supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum. They were then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies diluted in PBS. Human autoimmune serum S18 (13Reimer G. Rose K.M. Scheer U. Tan E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:800 dilution to stain RNA polymerase I. Human autoimmune serum S4 (14Reimer G. Pollard K.M. Penning C.A. Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Busch H. Tan E.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1987; 30: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1600 dilution to stain fibrillarin. Rabbit antibodies against human nucleolin were obtained from Elias (Freiburg, Germany) and used at a 1:200 dilution. After washing with PBS, bound antibodies were visualized by incubation for 1 h with Cy3TM-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse F(ab′)2 fragments (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Fig. 3 A shows representative images of the in vivo localization of GFP chimera of human topoisomerase I or of various fragments of it, and of GFP alone. Upon comparison of green fluorescent images (middle column) with corresponding images obtained by transmitted light (left column), it is readily apparent that all of these proteins were expressed in the nucleus. With the exception of GFP-topoisomerase IPhe723 and GFP alone, they all accumulated in the nucleoli. Nucleolar accumulation was clearly not correlated with the N-terminal domain being present or not; on the one hand, truncated versions having lost this portion to a varying extent (TI133–765, TI175–765, TI190–765, and TI210–765) showed a similar nucleolar accumulation as the entire enzyme (Topo I), the same holding true for the N-terminal domain alone (TI1–210) and for various subfragments of it (TI1–133 and TI133–210). On the other hand, the active site mutant (TIPhe723) did not accumulate in the nucleoli, although it still had the entire N-terminal domain. We have previously speculated that nucleolar accumulation of topoisomerase I could be simply due to its lesser mobility in this compartment, as compared with the nucleoplasm (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we compared here by FRAP the mobility of various topoisomerase I fragments inside and outside of the nucleolus. A representative summary of these data shown in Fig. 3 Bdemonstrates that those enzyme fragments having the capability of accumulating inside the nucleoli (TI, TI133–765, and TI210–765), also had a slower fluorescence recovery in this compartment than in the nucleoplasm. In contrast, the active site mutant (TIPhe723), incapable of accumulating inside the nucleoli, had the same mobility everywhere in the nucleus. In fact, nucleolar accumulation of the active site mutant seemed to be precluded by its attenuated mobility in the nucleoplasm, rather than by alterations in the nucleolus. In summary, these data support our previous hypothesis that differences in protein mobility govern nucleolar localization of topoisomerase I (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas our findings argue clearly against earlier suggestions that the capability of topoisomerase I accumulating inside the nucleoli should be a function of the N-terminal domain of the enzyme (8Mo Y.Y. Wang C. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Mo Y.Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Mo Y.Y., Yu, Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or of parts of it (15Edwards T. Saalem A. Shaman J. Dennis T. Gerigk C. Oliveros E. Gartenberg M. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36181-36188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, nucleolar accumulation due to a decreased mobility in this compartment seems be a feature not shared inadvertently by all proteins present in the nucleus because GFP alone exhibited a lesser intensity in the nucleoli (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel) although it is freely diffusible in all parts of the cell nucleus (7Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). A closer inspection of the subnucleolar distribution of the various topoisomerase I constructs (Fig.3 A, right) revealed that most of the truncated proteins (TI133–765, TI175–765, TI190–765, TI210–765, TI1–133, and TI133–210) filled the entire space of the nucleolus in an unstructured and homogeneous fashion. In contrast, full-length topoisomerase I (Topo I) had a distinct granular pattern. Such a pattern was even more pronounced by a fragment comprising the entire N-terminal domain of the enzyme (TI1–210), whereas it was not at all seen with subfragments of this domain (TI1–133and TI133–210). Thus, the N-terminal domain seems to direct topoisomerase I to a distinct substructure of the nucleolus. It stands to reason, that the enzyme should be more tightly bound to this substructure and therefore less mobile at this location than at other positions of the nucleolus. Unfortunately, we were not able to test this hypothesis by FRAP analysis because movements of the living cells compromised the spatial resolution of the method to such an extent that subnucleolar structures could not be reliably discriminated. To overcome this technical problem, we employed mild detergent extraction. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3 C. It gives a clear indication that topoisomerase I is indeed more tightly bound to the granular substructures in the nucleoli than to other positions of the cell nucleus. When Triton X-100 (0.07%, 4 min) was applied to the cells while they were cultured under the microscope, most of GFP-topoisomerase I was rapidly removed, and only enzyme bound to the granular substructure resisted extraction (Fig. 3 C,top). Thus, for full-length topoisomerase I, a granular nucleolar substructure was unveiled by this procedure. A similar observation was also made with the active site mutant (TIPhe725), which did not accumulate in the nucleoli, but nevertheless exhibited a faint granular pattern at corresponding locations (faintly visible in Fig. 3 A), and this pattern could also be enhanced by mild detergent extraction (Fig.3 C, bottom). For the truncated enzyme lacking the entire N-terminal domain (TI210–765) this was clearly not the case (Fig. 3C, middle). These observations suggest that the N-terminal domain per se anchors topoisomerase I at a distinct substructure of the nucleolus. This process does not require the enzyme to be capable of DNA transesterification and formation of covalent DNA complexes, and is not brought about by enzyme activityper se. Thus, it is entirely independent of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I and solely depends on the N-terminal domain. To get an idea at which nucleolar substructure topoisomerase I is anchored, we counterstained cells expressing GFP-topoisomerase I with antibodies directed against marker proteins of various nucleolar subcompartments. RNA polymerase I (Fig. 3 D,bottom), which delineates the fibrillar centers (16Scheer U. Rose K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), co-localized entirely with GFP-topoisomerase I. Antibodies against fibrillarin (Fig. 3 D, middle), which delineate the dense fibrillar component surrounding the fibrillar centers (17Spector D.L. Ochs R.L. Busch H. Chromosoma. 1984; 90: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), appeared to stain a larger structure that was more diffuse around the edges and covered a wider area than that occupied by topoisomerase I. Antibodies against nucleolin delineating the granular component and other peripheral parts of the nucleolus (18Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Spohn W.H. Busch H. Biol. Cell. 1985; 54: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) stained surrounding structures and were not co-localized with topoisomerase I and RNA polymerase I (Fig. 3 D, top). Thus we concluded that the nucleolar substructure, where topoisomerase I is anchored, must be the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus. The data in Fig.3 A demonstrate that the entire non-conserved N-terminal domain of the enzyme (amino acid residues 1–210) is required for this function because this was the only fragment exhibiting the same granular pattern in the nucleoli as the entire enzyme. It should also be kept in mind that accumulation of topoisomerase I at the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus is rapidly lost at ambient temperature (Fig.2 A) and thus seems to require cells to be alive. In contradiction to previous reports (15Edwards T. Saalem A. Shaman J. Dennis T. Gerigk C. Oliveros E. Gartenberg M. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36181-36188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the lack of co-localization with nucleolin shown in Fig. 3 D (top) argues against a role of this protein in the nucleolar targeting of topoisomerase I. Recently, we have observed that during mitosis topoisomerase I is more or less completely bound to the chromosomes (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the light of the findings presented in the previous paragraph, we were curious to see whether the N-terminal domain would also play a role in this allocation. Prima facie, this seemed not to be the case because a fragment lacking the entire N-terminal domain showed the same chromosomal pattern as full-length topoisomerase I, whereas a fragment comprising just the N-terminal domain seemed to be distributed equally between the mitotic cytoplasm and the chromosomes (Fig.4 A, bottom, compareleft, middle, and right). However, confocal sectioning revealed that the N-terminal fragment highlighted distinct dot-like structures within the metaphase plate (Fig. 4 B, arrows). When following such structures through a mitotic cycle (Fig. 4 C), we found that they were paired at metaphase (0′) and that each pair was split at anaphase (12′-17′), giving rise to individual daughter structures that were maintained during telophase (19′-25′), whereas toward G1-phase (31′-45′) they moved into closer proximity of each other (31′) and finally merged (36′). Eventually, all of them ended up in a reforming nucleolus (45′, arrowheads). These observations suggested that the N-terminal domain of topoisomerase I binds to certain chromatin regions, thereby possibly defining a chromosomal subpopulation normally not apparent on the background of enzyme bound to the entire length of the chromosomes. Assuming that this subpopulation might again be more tightly bound than the rest of the enzyme, we subjected mitotic cells to the same detergent extraction as described in Fig. 3 C. For the full-length enzyme (Fig. 4 D, top), this procedure indeed unveiled similar dots as delineated by the N-terminal domain alone (Fig. 4 C), whereas with the C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4 D, bottom) this was not the case. Here, most of the protein was extracted from the chromosomes within 4 min after adding the detergent, without revealing any dot-like structures. It should be noted that the dots delineated by the N-terminal domain alone were also resistant to extraction (not shown). Thus, the N-terminal domain seems to anchor topoisomerase I at certain regions of mitotic chromosomes, and, considering the fate of these structures at the end of mitosis (Fig. 4 C, 45′), they must be the same, similar, or related to those where the enzyme is anchored during interphase. The most likely candidates are the nucleolar organizer regions of the acrocentric chromosomes (19Mikelsaar A.V. Schmid M. Krone W. Schwarzacher H.G. Schnedl W. Hum. Genet. 1977; 37: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which contain the major rDNA genes, are located in the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus during interphase, and are normally associated with the machinery of rRNA transcription (16Scheer U. Rose K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan E.K. Imai H. Hamel J.C. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We confirmed this assumption by counterstaining mitotic cells expressing GFP-topoisomerase I with antibodies against RNA polymerase I. Fig.5 shows a representative result obtained at metaphase. Upon comparing the GFP signal of topoisomerase I (middle) with the immunofluorescent signal specific for RNA polymerase I (right), it becomes apparent that both proteins co-localize at globular structures within the mitotic chromatin and that these are the only distinct structures delineated by the two proteins. A similar co-localization with RNA polymerase I could also be demonstrated for the N-terminal domain of topoisomerase I alone (not shown). Summing up all the data, it appears that the N-terminal domain anchors topoisomerase I at the nucleolar organizer regions and related structures in the fibrillar centers of interphase nucleoli. This anchoring is clearly a specific feature of living cells, and the mechanism is dedicated to keeping a certain fraction of topoisomerase I in close proximity to the rDNA and the machinery of rRNA transcription throughout the entire cell cycle. Immunohistochemical studies have firmly established topoisomerase I as a mostly nucleolar protein (5Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Wadkins R.M. Danks M.K. Horowitz L. Baker S.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but it is unclear what actually directs the enzyme to the nucleolus and for what purpose. The most likely candidate responsible for targeting topoisomerase I to defined locations within the cell nucleus is the non-conserved N-terminal domain spanning amino acid residues 1–210 of the human enzyme. This domain distinguishes eukaryotic topoisomerase I from a minimal variant encoded by vaccinia virus (24Shuman S. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7478-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and from other microbial recombinases more distantly related (25Grainge I. Jayaram M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It contributes scarcely to the activity of the enzyme in vitro (26Lisby M. Olesen J. Skouboe C. Krogh B. Straub T. Boege F. Velmurugan S. Martensen P. Andersen A. Jayaram M. Westergaard O. Knudsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20220-20227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but it is believed to determine the biological properties of topoisomerase I. Most notably, it seems to be a docking place for interacting proteins, such as nucleolin (27Bharti A. Olson M. Kufe D. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Current belief holds that it also serves as a signal sequence triggering the nucleolar import of topoisomerase I (9Mo Y.Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,12Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), with nucleolin interactions possibly driving the process (15Edwards T. Saalem A. Shaman J. Dennis T. Gerigk C. Oliveros E. Gartenberg M. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36181-36188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, we have recently observed that in a living cell topoisomerase I exchanges between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm in a rapid and continuous manner, suggesting that the distribution of the enzyme between these compartments is more likely governed by differences in residence time than by directing signals (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, we show here that nucleolar accumulation of various truncated versions of topoisomerase I is correlated with their lesser mobility in this compartment and not with the N-terminal portion being intact or present. Thus, the N-terminal domain cannot be a trigger for the import of topoisomerase I into the nucleolus. Alternatively, we would like to propose that the N-terminal domain anchors topoisomerase I at distinct locations within the nucleolus. We show here that in a living cell topoisomerase I does not accumulate in the nucleolus in an indistinct manner. It rather concentrates at certain substructures, which we identify as the fibrillar centers. This property is clearly retained by the active site mutant and by a fragment comprising the entire N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–210), whereas fragments lacking portions of this domain accumulate in the nucleolus in an amorphous and unstructured manner. Nucleolin has previously been suggested to direct topoisomerase I to the nucleolus (15Edwards T. Saalem A. Shaman J. Dennis T. Gerigk C. Oliveros E. Gartenberg M. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36181-36188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but it is unlikely that it plays such a role in the targeting mechanism described here. First, it does not co-localize with topoisomerase I at the subnucleolar level. Second, fragments of topoisomerase I lacking most of the N-terminal domain but retaining the nucleolin-binding site (27Bharti A. Olson M. Kufe D. Rubin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) do not show a distinct accumulation at the fibrillar centers characteristic of the entire enzyme. In summary, our observations suggest that the N-terminal domain serves as an anchor, which increases the local concentration of topoisomerase I at the fibrillar centers of the nucleolus. Interestingly, this domain plays a similar role at mitosis, where it associates topoisomerase I with the nucleolar organizing regions of mitotic chromosomes, a finding previously also indicated by immunohistochemistry (28Suja J.A. Gebrane-Younes J. Geraud G. Hernandez-Verdun D. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Vosberg H.P. Lakomek H.J. Penner E. Bautz F.A. Chromosoma. 1986; 94: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). At both locations (fibrillar centers of the nucleolus and nucleolar organizing regions) topoisomerase I co-localizes with RNA polymerase I, which is believed to form a holo-enzyme together with a variety of other proteins also involved in rRNA transcription (30Seither P. Iben S. Grummt I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that topoisomerase I could be a regular component of this holo-enzyme. This suggestion is made even more plausible by the long-standing observation that topoisomerase I co-purifies with RNA polymerase I (31Rose K.M. Szopa J. Han F.S. Cheng Y.C. Richter A. Scheer U. Chromosoma. 1988; 96: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One is tempted to speculate that in this way a subfraction of topoisomerase I remains steadily associated with the rDNA and with the machinery required for RNA transcription, which is also attached to the nucleolar organizing regions (16Scheer U. Rose K.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan E.K. Imai H. Hamel J.C. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1239-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the precise localization of rRNA transcription within the nucleolus is still open to discussion. Some authors suggest that it is confined to the fibrillar centers (32Mais C. Scheer U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 709-718PubMed Google Scholar). Others claim that these just serve as a storage place for inactive RNA polymerase I and other transcription factors, whereas transcription occurs largely at the boundary to the dense fibrillar component (33Stanek D. Koberna K. Pliss A. Malinsky J. Masata M. Vecerova J. Risueno M.C. Raska I. Chromosoma. 2001; 110: 460-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This controversy provides us with two alternative interpretations of our data. One is that topoisomerase I at the fibrillar centers is a storage form. The other is that it is heavily involved there in the relaxation of super-coils generated during transcription of rDNA. The second model is supported by the finding that the N-terminal domain targets topoisomerase I to sites of transcriptional activity (34Shaiu W.L. Hsieh T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4358-4367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the observation that ongoing transcription seems to recruit topoisomerase I to the nucleoli (12Mao Y. Mehl I.R. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The inverse should be the case, if the enzyme was stored there in an inactive form. The second model is also more appealing from a teleological point of view. The rRNA genes are the most heavily transcribed genes in the cell, and it is making sense that a substantial portion of the machinery required for this process including topoisomerase I should always stay in place. The second model, however, somewhat disfavored by our own recent observation, is that camptothecin treatment immediately induces depletion of topoisomerase I from the nucleoli (2Christensen M. Barthelmes H. Feineis S. Knudsen B. Boege F. Mielke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15661-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). If topoisomerase I was heavily engaged in rDNA catalysis at the fibrillar centers, then it should be fixed there by camptothecin and not be depleted from the nucleoli. However, we do not know if the nucleoli are as accessible to camptothecin as the nucleoplasm. We are grateful to Jörg Hacker and Hilde Merkert, Research Center for Infectious Diseases, University of Würzburg, Germany for generously providing access to a confocal laser scanning microscope.

https://openalex.org/W2328929671,"Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is a regulator of cell growth, which suppresses the proliferation of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Here we show that in HT-29 cells IFN-gamma transiently increased the cellular level of the tyrosine kinase Fer, whose functioning was found to be essential for the proliferation of malignant cell-lines. The transient elevation in the level of Fer, was followed by its down-regulation, an effect which was most prominent after 6-8 h of IFN-gamma treatment. Up- and down-regulation of Fer was paralleled by the activation and subsequent deactivation of Stat3, which is a potent oncogene and a putative substrate of the tyrosine kinase Fer. Moreover, IFN-gamma induced the association of Fer and Stat3 and the newly formed complex was most stable at the down-regulated states of the two proteins. Formation of the Fer/Stat3 complex was accompanied by an attenuation in cell-cycle progression and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase. Thus, Fer and Stat3 are two proliferation-promoting factors whose down-regulation could contribute to the cytostatic activity of IFN-gamma in colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1992572230,"The cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1 is a central mediator in the imposition and maintenance of quiescence through the sequestration of G1-specific cyclin-cdk complexes. Previous studies have implicated the c-Jun co-activator protein Jab1 as a regulator of intracellular p27Kip1 levels. Jab1 has been reported to interact with p27Kip1 and cause its translocation to the cytoplasm as a prelude to the degradation of the cdk inhibitor. Here we describe experiments that showing phosphorylation of p27Kip1 at serine 10 leads to the suppression of Jab1 levels with the concomitant inhibition of c-Jun-dependent transcription. This repression is minimized upon quiescence exit through the rapid and preferential loss of the serine 10-phosphorylated form of p27Kip1 following serum stimulation. Our results, therefore, demonstrate an additional role for p27Kip1 in the modulation of c-Jun-dependent transcription via Jab1.

To search for an interacting molecule with hTid1, we applied two-hybrid yeast screening and isolated a novel gene, which encodes a 46 kDa protein of 373 residues. Within the deduced amino acid sequence, a region showing homology to the Ring Finger domain of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein was identified and the gene was designated as hRFI, standing for human Ring Finger homologous to IAP type. A 2.0 kb hRFI transcript was ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues as well as several cancer cell lines examined. Northern blot analysis showed that in 70% (14 out of 20) of esophageal cancer patients, expression of hRFI in cancerous regions was two or more times higher than in the corresponding normal tissues. HeLa cells transfected with hRFI construct exhibited a tendency to resist TNF-alpha induced apoptosis, suggesting an anti-apoptotic function of the hRFI product. Finally, hRFI protein was shown to be cleaved within the DEDD sequence spanning residues 230-233 by caspase-3 during the apoptotic induction."

Analysis of the transcriptional activity of fragments of the SERCA3 promoter showed the existence of a minimal promoter region located between bases −97 and +153 that contains one ETS-binding site (EBS) and two Sp1 elements that are essential for basal transcription. Mutation of the EBS or of the Sp1 sites abolished the basal activity of the promoter. We identified Ets-1 and Sp1 among endothelial nuclear factors that recognize the EBS and Sp1 sites on the promoter. Furthermore, transactivation of the −97/+301 promoter fragment by Ets-1 requires the presence of both the EBS and Sp1 sites, suggesting an interaction of the transcription factors on the gene promoter. Finally, overexpression of Ets-1 induced the expression of SERCA3 in endothelial cells and in fibroblasts.AF521044 We reported previously that the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 3 (SERCA3) gene is expressed in many tissues and in a subset of cells such as endothelial, epithelial, and lymphoid lineages.

AF521044 sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 3 ETS-binding site nucleotide reverse transcription tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)1 mediates the active transport of two Ca2+ ions from the cytosol to internal cellular stores after cell activation. SERCA is encoded by a multigene family; three genes, SERCA1 (Atp2a1), SERCA2 (Atp2a2), and SERCA3 (Atp2a3) have been identified, each giving rise to at least two isoforms by alternative splicing (1Lompré A.-M.

Turner R. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The structure of the human SERCA3 gene has been documented (14Dode L., De Greef C. Mountian I. Attard M. Town M.M. Casteels R. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13982-13994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but data concerning the mechanisms involved in the transcription of this gene remain scarce. There are only few data showing alterations in accumulation of the SERCA3 protein and mRNA. The differentiation of promyelocytic cells along the neutrophil granulocytic pathway induced by all-trans-retinoic acid or cAMP is associated with an increase in SERCA3 and a decrease in SERCA2b transcripts levels, whereas differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway induced by phorbol ester results in an increase in the production of both isoforms (8Launay S. Gianni M. Kovàcs T. Bredoux R. Bruel A. Gélébart P. Zassadowski F. Chomiene C. Enouf J. Papp B. Blood. 1999; 93: 4395-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In platelets and endothelial cells of spontaneously hypertensive rats, SERCA2b levels are similar to those of normotensive animals, but the SERCA3 isoforms are differentially regulated (19Martin V. Bredoux R. Corvazier E. Papp B. Enouf J. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Moutian I. Baba-Aissa F. Jonas J.C., De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Parys J.B. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic islets of non-obese, non-insulin-dependent, and spontaneously diabetic rats (Goto-Kakizaki), the levels of SERCA3 mRNA are 68% lower than in normal rats, whereas SERCA2b production is unaffected (21Varadi A. Molnar E. Östenson C.-G. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression of the SERCA3 gene is also reduced during proliferation of endothelial cells in culture (5Moutian I. Manolopoulos V.G., De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Wuytack F. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Deletion of the SERCA3 gene results in alteration in one main function of the endothelial cell, i.e. synthesis or secretion of vasoactive peptides such as nitric oxide. Furthermore, in endothelial cells, expression of SERCA3 is regulated in culture and in vivo by an increase in blood pressure. We have therefore undertaken the present study in order to determine the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the SERCA3 gene in endothelial cells. We have identified the transcription start site and showed that one ETS-binding site (EBS) and two Sp1 sites are essential for basal transcription of the gene. We show that the Ets-1 transcription factor is able to transactivate the SERCA3 promoter. Ets-1 is a member of the ETS family, and its expression is correlated to the formation of new blood vessels in the embryo and the adult. Ets-1 is expressed in endothelial precursors during vasculogenesis and in endothelial cells during angiogenesis in the embryo (22Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its pattern of expression is similar to what we showed for SERCA3 during development (10Anger M. Samuel J.-L. Marotte F. Wuytack F. Rappaport L. Lompré A.-M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 539-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and Ets-1 is known to transactivate the promoter of several genes that are important in angiogenesis such as the VEGF-R1 and-R2, the Tie receptors, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, and the VE-cadherin genes (23Lelièvre E. Lionneton F. Soncin F. Vandenbunder B. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We show here that the Ets-1 protein from nuclear extracts of endothelial cells binds to the SERCA3 promoter essential EBS and that Ets-1 is able to promote the transcription of reporter constructs of the gene in endothelial cells. This property is dependent on the integrity of the EBS but also of essential Sp1 sites, suggesting an interaction between the factors on the SERCA3 gene. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Ets-1 induces the expression of the SERCA3 protein in the cells. A 875-bp PstI fragment corresponding to nucleotides (nt) −131 to +744 of the 5′-coding and non-coding region of the rat SERCA3 cDNA clone RK 8–13 (24Burk S.E. Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18561-18568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen a mouse (Svj 129) genomic library constructed in the Lambda Fix II vector (Stratagene). Screening of 1 × 106 independent plaques yielded three positive genomic clones. Restriction mapping followed by Southern blotting with various probes and oligonucleotides derived from the rat cDNA showed that these clones encompassed about 20 kb, including exons 1–7 and ∼8 kb of 5′-flanking region of the mouse SERCA3 gene (not shown). In order to localize the transcription start site, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as follows. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues or cell lines by the guanidinium thiocyanate procedure (RNA Instapure, Eurogentec). RNA (10 μg) was mixed with 0.2 μg of random hexamers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 200 units of Superscript II RNase H− reverse-transcriptase (Invitrogen) and incubated for 50 min at 42 °C. One-tenth of the cDNA mix or 2.2 ng of genomic DNA was mixed with 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase and 50 pmol of each primer and amplified by PCR (3 min at 96 °C followed by 40 cycles of 96 °C/1 min, 57 °C/2 min, 72 °C/3 min, and then 72 °C/15 min). Primer 1 (CTTTGCAGACCGAGTTCG) and primer 2 (ATGTGGACAGGAGGGTAG) corresponded to nt −44/−27 and nt −2/+16, respectively. The antisense primer (TCTCCTCAAGGCTACTGTG) corresponded to nt +246/+264. Primer extension analysis was performed using an antisense oligonucleotide (ACCCCTTCCGGCCGCAATAGCAGC) corresponding to nt +58/+81 of the mouse SERCA3 gene sequence. The primer was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated with 20 μg of total RNA, and the reaction mixture was denatured at 80 °C for 2 min, slowly cooled to 42 °C, and the extension reaction performed for 90 min at 42 °C in the presence of 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction products were precipitated in ethanol and separated by electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide denaturing gel along with a known DNA ladder. The MoBr 204 cell line derived from mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells was generously provided by Professor P. Vicart (25Vicart P. Schwartz B. Vandewalle A. Bens M. Delouis C. Panthier J.J.

EA.hy926 is a hybrid cell line created by fusion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and a lung carcinoma, A549 cells (26Edgell C.J.S. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). 3T3-TagEts-1 cells constitutively express mouse Ets-1 following retroviral infection, and 3T3-Neo cells were infected with the corresponding control retrovirus (22Lelièvre E. Mattot V. Huber P. Vandenbunder B. Soncin F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma), 1 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for the neomycin-resistant cell lines, and 10% fetal calf serum (Myoclone Plus, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. In addition, the EA.hy926 medium was supplemented with 2% hypoxanthine/aminopterine/thymidine (Sigma). Various fragments of the mouse SERCA3 promoter all sharing the same 3′ end corresponding to the ATG translation start site were inserted into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The −97/+301-Luc construct (+1 corresponding to the transcription initiation site) was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-ACCCTCGAGCTCCTAGGACAC-3′ and 5′-GCTTCAAGCTTGCTGCCTGCCGGCCGT-3′, which contained a HindIII restriction site in place of the initial ATG codon. The PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII and inserted into the pGL3basic vector. The +153/+301-Luc construct was generated by the SmaI digestion of −97/+301-Luc and religation. To generate the −455/+301-Luc construct, a 357-bp XhoI fragment of a genomic clone was added to the −97/+301-Luc construct. The −337/+301-Luc construct was generated by inserting a 240-bp PCR-generated fragment into the −97/+301-Luc construct, usingNheI and XhoI sites of the PCR product and the −97/+301-Luc construct. The primers used were 5′-CCTAGCTAGCTTAGAGATGCGAGTGTA-3′ and 5′-TAGGAGCTCGAGGGTG-3′. The −748/+301-luc construct was produced by subcloning a genomic fragment in the HindIII site of pGL3. To generate the −1341/+301-Luc construct, a fragment was generated by PCR using the primers 5′-CATAGCTAGCCCCCAGGATGTGT-3′ and 5′-TAGGAGCTCGAGGGTG-3′, digested with XhoI and BglII, and ligated into the corresponding sites of the −97/+301-Luc construct. The EBS and Sp1 mutant constructs were generated using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using −97/+301-Luc construct as template. The sequences of the mutated EBS and Sp1 oligonucleotides (sense strand) used are as follows: EBS mut 5′-GGCTGCTATTGCGGCTATCAGGGGTGTGGGTGC-3′; Sp1 mut 5′-GGTGCAGGGCTAGTCCCGCGCCGCTATGCCCAGAGGACGG-3′. Each chimeric luciferase construct was used along with the pCMVβ reporter vector (Stratagene) for the cotransfection of 3T3-neo, 3T3-TagEts-1, MoBr 204, and EA.hy926 cells. Cotransfection of the chimeric luciferase constructs with a tagged mouse Ets-1 expression vector (pcDNA-TagEts-1) was performed in MoBr 204. Cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with a 2:1 FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (in μl)/DNA (in μg) ratio for MoBr 204 and 3:1 for EA.hy926. After incubation for 40 h at 37 °C, cells were lysed, and the cytosolic fraction was collected. Luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega), and light intensity was measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, EG & G Berthold). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed according to established procedures by hydrolysis of O-nitro-β-d-galactopyranoside (ICN) and measurement of the A 405 of the products on a microplate reader (FL 600, Bio-Tek). Luciferase activity was normalized according to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as relative luciferase units. Nuclear extracts were prepared from various cell lines as described by Schreiber et al. (27Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). For gel shifts, various amounts of proteins, ranging from 2 to 40 μg, were incubated with 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled EBS or Sp1 double-stranded oligonucleotides, in 20 μl of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). In order to determine the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes formed, wild-type and mutated oligonucleotides were used as competitors and were incubated with the proteins for 10 min before addition of the labeled probe. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and were then subjected to electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel at 4 °C and 200 V. The sequence of the oligonucleotide probes used (sense strand) is as follows: EBS 5′-GGCTGCTATTGCGGCCGGAAGGGGTGTGGGTGC-3′; Sp1 5′-GGTGCAGGGCGGGTCCCGCGCCGCCCCGCCCAGAGGACGG-3′. The sequence of the mutated EBS and Sp1 oligonucleotides was as described above. The double-stranded EBS and Sp1 oligonucleotides were32P-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) to a specific activity of 3 × 108 cpm/μg. DNA affinity purification of nuclear proteins was performed using 150 μg of nuclear extracts incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of double-stranded 5′-biotinylated EBS or Sp1 probes immobilized on streptavidin-agarose beads. Beads were washed and boiled in sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred on nylon membrane. Proteins were detected using anti-Ets-1 (Transduction Laboratories, E34620, 1:1000) or anti-Sp1 (Sigma, 1:500) antibodies and visualized by the chemiluminescence system (AmershamBiosciences). RT-PCR analysis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using the following primers: SERCA3, 5′-TATTGGAGTGTACGTAGGCCTGG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTCGGACAGAAATGGGAGACGGGA-3′; SERCA2b, 5′-GGAGTGGATTGTGCAATCTTTGAGT-3′ and 5′-GAGATTTTCAGCACCATCAGCCACT-3′. The PCR conditions were as follows: 30 s/94 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C/30 s, 60 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s, and finally 72 °C for 7 min. In situ immunolabeling was performed using rabbit anti-SERCA3 (28Fuentes J.M. Lompré A.-M. MØller J.V. Falson P. Le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and anti-SERCA2b (29Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Verbist J. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) antibodies (1:200) and revealed with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit whole IgG (Sigma). In some experiments, double immunofluorescence was performed using anti-Ets-1 (1:100) revealed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulins. The relative luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities and expressed either as percent of the control or as fold induction over the activity of 0pGL3. The data are expressed in mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test, was used for multiple comparisons. An unpaired t test was used for comparison of two groups. Data were analyzed by using the SigmaStat Statistical Software Package, version 1.0 (Jandel Scientific). Two different approaches were used to determine the transcription initiation site. First, the region located upstream of the translation start site was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig.1 A) using two sense primers and one antisense primer located upstream of the first ATG (see Fig.2 A for location of primers), and total RNA was isolated from mouse placenta, kidney, and fetal liver. No fragment was amplified from any tissue when using primer 1, whereas the control genomic DNA amplification yielded an expected 280-bp fragment. On the other hand, an ∼250-bp fragment was amplified when using primer 2 on all total RNA samples, thus suggesting that transcription of the SERCA3 gene was initiated in the region between the binding sites for primer 1 and primer 2. Primer extension analysis performed using an antisense primer that corresponded to nucleotides −220/−244 bp upstream from the first ATG showed a single 82-bp fragment that was obtained with RNA isolated from fetal liver and adult mouse spleen, thymus, heart, and lung (Fig. 1 B), as well as from adult mouse trachea, intestine, and kidney (not shown). This indicated that a single transcription initiation site is located 301 bp upstream from the translation site regardless of the origin of the tissue (hematopoietic, epithelial, and endothelial). This transcription initiation site was referred to as +1 (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Structural features of the SERCA3 promoter. A, sequence of exon 1 and of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse SERCA3 gene. Nucleotides are numbered relative to the identified transcription initiation site (+1). The primers used in identification of the initiation start site are indicated byarrows below the sequence. The coding portion of exon 1 is in italic. The ATG translation start site located in +301 is boldface type. B, functional analysis of the murine SERCA3 promoter. Various constructs of the SERCA3 gene were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3 basic plasmid (0pGL3) and transfected in EA.hy 926 or MoBr 204 endothelial cells together with the pCMVβ-Gal normalization plasmid. The names of the constructs refer to the position of the most 5′-nucleotide relative to the initiation start site +1. Luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity and expressed as fold induction relative to the activity of 0pGL3, in relative luciferase units (RLU). The data represent means ± S.D. of at least three experiments performed in triplicate. Activities were compared with the −97/+301 construct activity. *,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the region located immediately ahead of the identified transcription initiation site showed no consensus TATA or CAAT elements, the non-coding portion of exon 1 was found to be particularly rich in G + C residues (72%) and is most probably responsible for the transcription start (Fig. 2 A). Various segments of the promoter region of the SERCA3 gene ranging from −1341 to +301 were cloned ahead of the luciferase reporter gene and analyzed for transcriptional activity in EA.hy926 where SERCA3 is constitutively expressed, or MoBr 204 endothelial cells where the gene is inducible depending on the culture substrates (not shown). The −97/+301 construct displayed a strong activity in both cell lines (31.19 ± 5.3- to 31.2 ± 10.2-fold over 0pGL3 control in EA.hy926 and MoBr 204 cell lines, respectively, p < 0.001, Fig.2 B), whereas promoter activity progressively decreased when using constructs extending further up in the gene. The −337/+301-Luc and −455/+301-Luc constructs showed a significant loss of basal activity in both cell lines, and the −748/+301-Luc construct activity was only 4.35 ± 0.84- and 9.67 ± 4.72-fold that of the 0pGL3 construct in EA.hy926 and MoBr 204, respectively. Finally, the −1341/+301-Luc showed no remaining activity in either cell line. These results demonstrate that the main region responsible for the basal activity of the SERCA3 promoter is located in the −97/+153 fragment of the gene and that negative regulatory elements are located in the region located ahead of nt −455. When comparing the mouse and human gene sequences, a high level of sequence similarity was observed in the proximal non-coding region corresponding to the active promoter region identified above, including the strict conservation of one EBS and two Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 3 A). We therefore investigated the possibility that these sites were essential to the transcription of the gene by introducing mutations at either site and testing the transcriptional activity of the resulting construct. Mutation of the EBS resulted in a 70 and 85% loss of activity when transfected in EA.hy926 and MoBr 204 cells, respectively (Fig. 3 B), and mutation of the Sp1 sites decreased the transcription activity to ∼20% of control values in both cell lines, indicating that the EBS and Sp1 sites were necessary for the basal transcription of the SERCA3 gene. There was no significant difference in transcription activity between EBS and Sp1 mutated constructs. In order to determine whether the EBS and Sp1 sites were able to bind nuclear proteins from endothelial cells, gel mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from EA.hy926 and MoBr 204 cells were performed. EA.hy926 nuclear proteins formed one major complex with the EBS and Sp1-labeled probes (Fig. 4). Binding to the EBS probe disappeared in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild-type EBS probe but not with unlabeled mutated EBS probe. When testing for binding to the Sp1 probe, complete disappearance of the nucleoprotein complex was observed with the wild-type Sp1 probe. Partial competition was obtained with the unlabeled mutated Sp1 probe, most probably because this probe still contains a partial Sp1 site. The complex observed with the EBS and Sp1 oligonucleotides were of the same molecular weight, suggesting that the same multimeric complex is bound to both sites. 40 μg of MoBr 204 cell extracts were necessary to observe nucleoprotein complexes, suggesting a lower abundance of the specific nuclear proteins in this cell line. The proteins that recognized either site were identified by affinity purification using biotinylated probes coupled to agarose beads (Fig. 5). Several members of the Ets family may potentially bind the identified EBS (30Ghysdael J. Boureux A. Karin M. Progress in Gene Expression. 1. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 29-89Google Scholar). We tested the Ets-1 transcription factor as it is expressed in endothelial cells and associated with the angiogenic phenotype. Western blot analysis of the nuclear proteins bound to the EBS indicated that Ets-1 was present in large amounts in EA.hy926 cells and in lower amounts in MoBr 204 cells. The apparent molecular mass of Ets-1 in the human cell line was 51 kDa, whereas in the mouse it was 62 kDa. In total extract from MoBr the two classical Sp1 proteins were observed; the main one corresponded to p95 and a fainter band to p106 (apparent molecular mass of 95 and 106 kDa, respectively). Both proteins were retained on the Sp1 beads. Interestingly, the p106 was also retained on the EBS beads, and significant amounts of Ets-1 were retained by the Sp1 beads. Since the EBS probe does not contain Sp1 sites and reciprocally, this suggests that the Ets-1 and Sp1 factors interact directly with each other on the SERCA3 promoter. Ets-1 was able to transactivate the SERCA3 promoter in MoBr 204 (Fig.6) as cotransfection of an Ets-1 expression vector increased the activity of the −97/+301-Luc construct by 6-fold. There was no activation of the −1341/+301-Luc construct by Ets-1 which confirms the strong repression observed in this region. There was rather a small repression probably due to transfection of two vectors. Mutation of the identified EBS abolished the activity of Ets-1 on the −97/+301-Luc reporter vector. Interestingly, mutation of the Sp1 site also prevented the activation of the promoter by Ets-1 (3.41 ± 1.23 versus 79.14 ± 25.81), further suggesting that Sp1 and Ets-1 act together for transactivation of the SERCA3 gene promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2330881865,"Inactivation of the neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) gene de-regulates RAS and cooperates with mutation or loss of the p53 tumor suppressor to induce tumorigenesis. p19(ARF) acts upstream of p53 in an oncogene checkpoint to induce apoptosis in response to activated RAS and other factors that stimulate proliferation. Therefore, we bred p19(ARF-/-) to NF1(+/-) mice to determine if loss of these genes collaborates in tumorigenesis. As expected from the embryonic lethality of NF1 null mice, no mice lacking both p19(ARF) and NF1 were born. Unexpectedly, the loss of one allele of NF1 did not greatly shorten the time to tumor formation in a p19(ARF) null background. The tumor types observed were characteristic of p19(ARF) null animals, not those associated with neurofibromatosis or those observed with NF1(+/-)/p53(+/-) mice. However, seven out of 12 animals developed multiple tumors, some with metastases. This multiple tumor phenotype was not previously observed with p19(ARF)-null mice and suggests a distinct form of cooperation between the loss of these tumor suppressors."

Twenty-four microsatellite markers located on chromosome 18q were genotyped in 145 primary tumors and 10 cell lines in order to identify putative tumor suppressor genes implicated in tumor progression. Two different minimal common regions of loss (MCRL) were identified at 18q22 and 18q23 respectively. To refine and delineate boundaries of an homozygous deletion found in one cell line, 44 extra markers located at 18q22 were analysed and the homozygous deletion was precisely defined within a critical region of 4.9 Mb. Four known genes (CDH7, CDH19, DNAM-1, FLJ23594) located in this critical region and two EST clusters (Hs.96900, Hs.98628) were selected for further investigations. For these six genes, genomic structures were established, somatic mutations were screened in 20 HNSCC and 10 cell lines and transcription levels were determined in eight cell lines. No somatic mutations were found in any of the candidate genes analysed (57 coding exons). However, differential transcription levels were observed for CDH19 and Hs.96900 in head and neck cancer cell lines supporting their putative involvement through down regulation mechanisms in head and neck cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2115310323,"Muscarinic receptors purified from porcine atria and devoid of G protein underwent a 9–27-fold decrease in their apparent affinity for the antagonists quinuclidinyl benzilate,N-methylscopolamine, and scopolamine when treated with the thiol-selective reagent N-ethylmaleimide. Their apparent affinity for the agonists carbachol and oxotremorine-M was unchanged. Conversely, the rate of alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide, as monitored by the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, was decreased by antagonists while agonists were without effect. The receptor also underwent a time-dependent inactivation that was hastened by N-ethylmaleimide but slowed by quinuclidinyl benzilate and N-methylscopolamine. The destabilizing effect of N-ethylmaleimide was counteracted fully or nearly so at saturating concentrations of each antagonist and the agonist carbachol. Similar effects occurred with human M2 receptors differentially tagged with the c-Myc and FLAG epitopes, coexpressed in Sf9 cells, and extracted in digitonin/cholate. The degree of coimmunoprecipitation was unchanged by N-ethylmaleimide, which therefore was without discernible effect on oligomeric size. The data are quantitatively consistent with a model in which the purified receptor from porcine atria interconverts spontaneously between two states (i.e. R ⇌ R*). Antagonists favor the R state; agonists and N-ethylmaleimide favor the comparatively unstable R* state, which predominates after purification. Occupancy by a ligand stabilizes both states, and antagonists impede alkylation by favoring R over R*. Similarities with constitutively active receptors suggest that R and R* are akin to the inactive and active states, respectively. Purified M2 receptors therefore appear to exist predominantly in their active state."
