https://openalex.org/W2007239691,An antiserum to mGluR1 alpha labeled a 160 kd protein in immunoblots of membranes derived from rat brain or cells transfected with mGluR1 alpha. Immunoreactivity for mGluR1 alpha was present in discrete subpopulations of neurons. The GABAergic neurons of the cerebellar cortex were strongly immunoreactive; only some Golgi cells were immunonegative. Somatostatin/GABA-immunopositive cells in the neocortex and hippocampus were enriched in mGluR1 alpha. The hippocampal cells had spiny dendrites that were precisely codistributed with the local axon collaterals of pyramidal and granule cells. Electron microscopic immunometal detection of mGluR1 alpha showed a preferential localization at the periphery of the extensive postsynaptic densities of type 1 synapses in both the cerebellum and the hippocampus. The receptor was also present at sites in the dendritic and somatic membrane where synapses were not located.

https://openalex.org/W2027582069,"Growth factor-mediated signaling has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, is expressed in the presumptive dental epithelium at the initiation of tooth development. Subsequently, epithelial signaling leads to mesenchymal induction of BMP-4 expression. To address the role of this factor, BMP-4-releasing agarose beads were added to dental mesenchyme in culture. These beads induced a translucent mesenchymal zone similar to that induced by dental epithelium. Moreover, three transcription factors (Msx-1, Msx-2, and Egr-1) whose expression is governed by epithelial signaling were induced in response to BMP-4. In addition, BMP-4 induced its own mesenchymal expression. These findings support the hypothesis that BMP-4 mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during early tooth development."

https://openalex.org/W1594196316,"In this report we show that NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing the human multidrug transporter (MDR1 or P-glycoprotein), in contrast to the control NIH-3T3 cells, actively extrude the hydrophobic acetoxymethyl ester (AM) derivatives used for cellular loading of various fluorescent calcium and pH indicators. This dye extrusion is blocked by competing substrates and inhibitors of the multidrug transporters, e.g. by verapamil, vincristine, sodium orthovanadate, oligomycin, and a monoclonal anti-MDR1 antibody. The hydrophilic free acid forms of the indicators are not exported by MDR1. We also demonstrate that in isolated cell membranes the MDR1-ATPase, similar to that by known substrates of the transporter, is stimulated by the AM derivatives of fluorescent dyes whereas the free acid forms of the dyes are without effect. Since (i) the AM derivatives of the fluorescent indicators rapidly permeate the cell membrane and are readily cleaved by high activity and large capacity cytoplasmic esterases and (ii) the free acid forms are not substrates for export by MDR1, the observations above suggest that dye extrusion by MDR1 may occur without a cytoplasmic appearance of the AM compounds. These data also call attention to the possible interaction of widely used hydrophobic fluorescent indicators with MDR1 and offer an efficient detection of MDR1-expressing tumor cells as well as a screening method for examining drug interactions with the multidrug transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2114640601,"Synaptotagmin (syt), a synaptic vesicle-specific protein known to bind Ca2+ in the presence of phospholipids, has been proposed to mediate Ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter release. We have addressed the role of syt in neurotransmitter release in vivo by generating mutations in synaptotagmin (syt) in the fruitfly and assaying the subsequent effects on neurotransmission. Most embryos that lack syt fail to hatch and exhibit very reduced, uncoordinated muscle contractions. Larvae with partial lack-of-function mutations show almost no evoked excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs) in 0.4 mM Ca2+ and a 15-fold reduction in EJP amplitude in 1.0 mM Ca2+ when compared with heterozygous controls. In contrast, we observe an increase in the frequency of spontaneous miniature EJPs in the mutants. These results provide in vivo evidence that syt plays a key role in Ca2+ activation of neurotransmitter release and indicate the existence of separate pathways for evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W2129214482,"A general role for chaperonin ring structures in mediating folding of newly translated proteins has been suggested. Here we have directly examined the role of the E. coli chaperonin GroEL in the bacterial cytoplasm by production of temperature-sensitive lethal mutations in this essential gene. After shift to nonpermissive temperature, the rate of general translation in the mutant cells was reduced, but, more specifically, a defined group of cytoplasmic proteins — including citrate synthase, ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and polynucleotide phosphorylase — were translated but failed to reach native form. Similarly, a monomeric test protein, maltose-binding protein, devoid of its signal domain, was translated but failed to fold to its native conformation. We conclude that GroEL indeed is a machine at the distal end of the pathway of transfer of genetic information, assisting a large and specific set of newly translated cytoplasmic proteins to reach their native tertiary structures."
https://openalex.org/W2108859348,"Prokaryotic chitinases, class III plant chitinases, yeast chitinases, and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidases share weak amino acid sequence similarities at the certain region of each enzyme. These regions have been assumed to be important for catalytic activities of the enzymes. To verify this assumption, three amino acid residues (Ser-160, Asp-200, Glu-204) in chitinase A1 of Bacillus circulans WL-12 were chosen, based on the amino acid sequence alignment of the regions sharing sequence similarity, and were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic parameters for 4-methylumbelliferyl-N,N',N-triacetylchitotriose hydrolysis were determined with wild-type and seven mutant chitinases. Chitinases with Glu-204-->Gln mutation and Glu-204-->Asp mutation were essentially inactive and kcat values of these chitinases were approximately 1/5,000 and 1/17,000 of that of wild-type chitinase, respectively. Asp-200-->Asn mutation decreased the kcat value to approximately 1/350 of that of the wild-type enzyme, while the Km value decreased only slightly. On the other hand, neither the kcat value nor the Km value was affected by Asp-200-->Glu mutation. Thus, it appeared that Glu-204 and Asp-200 are directly involved in the catalytic events of chitinase A1. The role of the carboxyl group of Asp-200 can be fully substituted by that of Glu residue. The Ser-160-->Ala mutant retained 10% activity of the wild-type chitinase indicating that the hydroxyl group of Ser-160 is not absolutely required for the catalytic activity. These results indicate a lysozyme-type catalytic mechanism of the chitinase."

https://openalex.org/W2049829724,"The wingless (wg) and decapentaplegic (dpp) genes of Drosophila encode homologs of secreted growth factors and are required for the correct patterning of the appendages. We show that the presumptive tips of both the leg and wing, the distal extreme of the proximodistal axis, are characterized by the close association of cells expressing wg, dpp, and the homeobox gene aristaless (al). Ectopic expression of wg can induce both ectopic al expression and a duplication of the proximodistal axis (the development of supernumerary legs), but only in regions expressing high levels of dpp. Ectopic al expression can induce a duplication of the proximodistal axis in the wing, suggesting that it may also be directly involved in axis specification. The proximodistal axis may be specified via a mechanism involving a direct interaction between cells expressing wg, dpp, and possibly al."
https://openalex.org/W2037001268,"We report the characterization of the first successful treatment of neuronal ischemic injury in vivo by cell-permeant Ca2+ chelators. The chelators attenuated glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+ increases and neurotoxicity in neuronal explant cultures. When infused intravenously in rats, permeant fluorescent BAPTA analogs accumulated in neurons in several brain regions. BAPTA-AM, infused in vivo, reduced Ca2+-dependent spike frequency adaptation and post-spike train hyperpolarizations in CA1 neurons taken from treated animals. This effect was reproduced by direct injections of BAPTA into untreated neurons. The effects of three different chelators (BAPTA, 5,5′-difluoro BAPTA, and 4,4′-difluoro BAPTA) on Ca2+-dependent membrane excitability varied with their Ca2+ affinity. When the chelators' permeant forms were used to treat rats prior to the induction of focal cortical ischemia, they were highly neuroprotective, as gauged by significant reductions in cortical infarction volumes and neuronal sparing. The chelators' protective effects in vivo also reflected their affinity for Ca2+. This report provides the most direct evidence to date that intracellular Ca2+ excess triggers early neurodegeneration in vivo and contributes a novel therapeutic approach to neuronal ischemia of potential clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W1996839811,"The POU-type homeodomain protein UNC-86 and the LIM-type homeodomain protein MEC-3, which specify neuronal cell fate in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, bind cooperatively as a heterodimer to the mec-3 promoter. Heterodimer formation increases DNA binding stability and, therefore, increases DNA binding specificity. The in vivo significance of this heterodimer formation in neuronal differentiation is suggested by (i) a loss-of-function mec-3 mutation whose product in vitro binds DNA well but forms heterodimers with UNC-86 poorly and (ii) a mec-3 mutation with wild-type function whose product binds DNA poorly but forms heterodimers well."
https://openalex.org/W2038386221,"Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) reduced G protein-dependent inhibition of Ca2+ channels by glutamate, GABAB, adenosine, muscarinic, α-adrenergic, and LHRH receptors in a variety of central and peripheral neurons. PKC stimulation also relieved the inhibitory effect of internal GTPγS and reduced tonic G protein-mediated inhibition observed with internal GTP in the absence of transmitter receptor agonist. Basal Ca2+ channel currents were enhanced by PKC stimulation in most neurons studied. The PKC-induced enhancement of basal current was voltage dependent, and enhanced currents displayed altered kinetics. Inhibition of G proteins with GDPβS attenuated the PKC-induced enhancement of basal Ca2+ channel current. These results show that PKC regulates the inhibitory effects of G proteins, possibly by disrupting the coupling of G proteins to Ca2+ channels. The PKC-induced enhancement of Ca2+ channel current results, at least in part, from the removal of tonic G protein-mediated inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1499176694,"Lymphocytes activated by antigen receptor cross-linking or phorbol esters adhere avidly to surfaces bearing intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) through the adhesion receptor lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). It is not known whether avid adhesion by stimulated lymphocytes is due to higher affinity binding of ICAM-1 or due solely to post-receptor mechanisms. We have used a recombinant, soluble form of the ICAM-1 molecule to measure the affinity of binding to LFA-1 on unstimulated T cells and T cells stimulated with phorbol esters. The affinity was found to be too low for direct measurements, requiring instead the use of competition protocols in which ICAM-1 competes for binding with radiolabeled Fab from a monoclonal antibody specific for LFA-1. By analysis of the equilibrium and kinetics of competitive binding, we found that the affinity on unstimulated T cells is very low, about 100 microM. Activation of the T cells by phorbol esters caused a small increase in average binding affinity. Further analysis suggested that the change in average affinity reflected the conversion of a fraction of LFA-1 molecules to a state with a 200-fold higher affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2119318224,"Expression of the homeobox fusion gene E2A-PBX1 under control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer efficiently induced malignancies in transgenic mice. All animals died before 5 months of age with lymphomas that demonstrated phenotypes consistent with transitional intermediate thymocytes (CD4+/CD8+/CD3med). E2A-PBX1 also markedly altered lymphoid development in pretumorous animals, reducing the number of thymocytes and bone marrow B lineage progenitors to 20% of normal levels. In spite of the observed reductions in lymphoid cells, premalignant animals contained significantly increased numbers of cycling thymocytes, but a higher proportion was also undergoing apoptosis, suggesting that increased cell death resulted in the marked lymphopenias. These data indicate that the chimeric homeodomain protein E2A-PBX1 paradoxically induces both proliferation and apoptosis in lymphoid cells, suggesting an in vivo association between nuclear oncogene-induced cell cycle progression and programed cell death."

https://openalex.org/W1542671610,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate whether prolines in the predicted transmembrane domains play essential roles in the function of human P-glycoprotein. Mutant cDNAs in which codons for each of the 13 prolines were changed to alanine were expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed with respect to their ability to confer resistance to various drugs. Mutations of either Pro223 in transmembrane segment 4 or Pro866 in transmembrane segment 10, drastically reduced the ability of the mutant proteins to confer resistance to colchicine, adriamycin, or actinomycin D, whereas the capacity to confer resistance to vinblastine was retained. These results strongly suggest that residues in putative transmembrane segments 4 and 10, which are found in identical positions when homologous, presumably duplicated, halves of the transporter are aligned, play important roles in recognition of colchicine, adriamycin, and actinomycin D. They may either interact to form a single drug-binding site or form part of two equivalent, but independent, drug-binding sites. The lack of detectable effect of either mutation on vinblastine transport, however, indicates that there are differences in the requirements for binding of various substrates to P-glycoprotein. Mutation of Pro709 in transmembrane segment 7 resulted in a protein unable to confer drug resistance. A change at this position was found to induce a structural aberration, since the major protein product observed in transfected cells had an apparent molecular weight of 150,000, whereas the wild-type enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 170,000. Mutation of the other 10 prolines yielded protein products with structural and functional characteristics indistinguishable from wild-type P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2155342110,"To define sequences in the human multidrug resistance (MDR1) promoter that influence transcription, we measured the activity of MDR1 promoter constructs using luciferase as a reporter gene. Deletion of promoter sequences to -121 (relative to the transcription initiation site) had very little effect on promoter activity in transiently transfected cells. Further deletion to -88 increased activity about 4-fold, while deletion to -51 decreased activity about 10-fold. The data indicated that between -121 and -88 and between -73 and -51 were sequences that modulated promoter activity. Because these two regions contain G-rich sequences, which are important for function in other promoters, the effect of mutation of the G-rich regions (-110 to -103 and -61 to -43) on MDR1 promoter activity was measured. Mutation of the -110 G-box (-110 to -103) resulted in a 6-fold increase in promoter activity and inhibited the formation of a specific nuclear protein complex, suggesting that this region functions as a transcriptional repressor binding site in cycling cells. In contrast, mutation of the -50 G-box (-61 to -43) reduced promoter activity 5-fold. DNase-I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis indicated that specific but distinct protein-DNA complexes formed at each of these two G-rich regions. The -50 G-box contains overlapping sites to which both SP1 and EGR-1 bind specifically. Co-transfection of MDR1 promoter constructs with SP1 into cells that lack SP1 (Drosophila Schneider 2 cells) activated equivalently both the wild type MDR1 promoter and a synthetic promoter containing the MDR1 -50 GC box and MDR1 initiator element."
https://openalex.org/W1506425398,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors consist of at least six different subtypes termed mGluR1-mGluR6. They belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors and commonly possess an unusually large extracellular domain preceding the seven transmembrane segments. mGluR1 and mGluR2 show similar affinities for L-glutamate but distinct patterns in their responsiveness to quisqualate and trans-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentane-dicarboxylate (tACPD). To assign structural determinants for the different agonist selectivities, we constructed a series of chimeric receptors at the extracellular domains of mGluR1 and mGluR2 and determined their agonist selectivities by measuring their electrophysiological responses to L-glutamate, quisqualate, and tACPD in Xenopus oocytes. Replacement of the extracellular domain up to about one-half of the amino-terminal extracellular domain of mGluR1 with the corresponding portion of mGluR2 generated a pattern of the agonist selectivity characteristic of mGluR2. The acquirement of this property in agonist selectivity was further indicated by the selective responses of these chimeric receptors to an mGluR2-specific agonist, (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine. This investigation demonstrates that the extracellular domain of mGluR is critical in determining agonist selectivity and that the mode of determination of agonist selectivity of mGluR is different from that of other G protein-coupled receptors for small molecule transmitters."
https://openalex.org/W1564741855,"We have previously demonstrated that a basic amino acid residue of interleukin (IL)-8, namely Arg-6, is critical for the binding of IL-8 to its receptor. We reasoned that this residue is likely to be poised to directly interact with a counterpart acidic residue on the receptor. To identify this key residue, we systematically mutated to Ala all acidic residues present on the ligand accessible surface of IL-8 receptor type A. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that two residues which are present in extracellular loop 3 of the receptor, namely Glu-275 and Arg-280, are critical for ligand binding. In addition, we show that although Asp-11 is critical for ligand binding, a conservative mutation of Asp-11 to Glu or a substitution of Asp-11 with Lys (the residue found at position 11 in IL-8 receptor type B) does not affect the Kd of the receptor/ligand interaction. These data suggest that Lys-11 recruits a new and favorable interaction with IL-8 (analogous to that of IL-8 receptor type B with IL-8) or that the cavity created by mutating Asp-11 to Ala is particularly deleterious. Finally, we discuss fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining data which support the hypothesis that the N-terminal region and the extracellular loop 3 of the receptor may lie in close proximity of one another and constitute a major binding domain for IL-8."
https://openalex.org/W1576807703,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA which may act as a metabolic coupling factor in nutrient-induced insulin release. We have studied the long term regulation of ACC by nutrients using the cell line INS-1. Glucose, from 5 to 20 mM, elicited a 15-fold increase in ACC mRNA. The effect was detected after 4 h and reached a maximum by 24 h. ACC protein accumulation followed that of ACC mRNA, and glucose did not modify the half-life of the ACC transcript. Glucose caused a dose-dependent rise in the glucose 6-phosphate content of INS-1 cells. 2-Deoxyglucose, which is phosphorylated by glucokinase but is not further metabolized, induced ACC mRNA. The effect of glucose was blocked by the glucokinase inhibitors mannoheptulose and glucosamine and was not mimicked by the 3-O-methyl or 6-deoxy analogues of glucose, which are not phosphorylated. Activation of the Ca2+, cAMP, and C-kinase pathways with high K+, forskolin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate, respectively, caused insulin release but not ACC mRNA induction. Basal insulin release, at 5 mM glucose, correlated with the ACC protein content of INS-1 cells preincubated for 24 h at various glucose concentrations. In conclusion, glucose is a potent inducer of the ACC gene, and glucose 6-phosphate may mediate its effect. Different signaling systems mediate the action of glucose on insulin release and ACC gene expression. The data strengthen the view that ACC plays a pivotal role in nutrient-induced insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1994090017,"Intracellular free Mg2+ concentrations ([Mg2+]i) in single rat brain neurons were measured with the Mg(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye magfura-2. Addition of glutamate with glycine raised [Mg2+]i from 1 to more than 11 mM compared with the resting concentration of 0.5 mM, an effect mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Most of the increase in [Mg2+]i was independent of extracellular Mg2+, but was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. The second component of the increase induced by glutamate was independent of extracellular Ca2+, but required extracellular Mg2+ and was amplified by extracellular Na+ removal. These results indicate that regulation of [Mg2+]i by neurotransmitters such as glutamate may be important in controlling neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2090476414,"To examine how light-evoked excitatory synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells are transformed into output patterns of activity, action potentials were recorded with cell-attached patch-clamp techniques, and then EPSCs and EPSPs were recorded from the same cell in the whole-cell configuration. AP7, an NMDA antagonist, reduced the light-evoked peak spike frequency 36% ± 21% (mean ± SD) and reduced the EPSC amplitude, indicating a major role for NMDA receptors in the light response. CNQX, a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, reduced the light-evoked peak spike frequency 28% ± 22%. CNQX also caused a voltage- and magnesium-dependent delay in spike onset. AP7 and CNQX, however, did not differ significantly in their effect on the EPSC time course, indicating that postsynaptic cellular properties are responsible for the delay observed in the presence of CNQX. These results show that the NMDA receptor contribution to the excitatory response is increased as the cell is depolarized from rest by non-NMDA input."
https://openalex.org/W1580231709,The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a processivity subunit for eukaryotic DNA polymerase delta. We present biochemical evidence that yeast PCNA likely adopts a toroidal structure containing an inside cavity through which double-stranded DNA slides. A comparative study of DNA replication reactions on circular versus linear model substrates shows that PCNA can only interact productively with DNA polymerase delta if the substrate is linear. This combined with the observation that a large molar excess of PCNA is required for maximal stimulatory activity is consistent with a model in which PCNA slips onto the end of the DNA in an ATP-independent manner.

https://openalex.org/W1551893941,"The role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the regulation of transmitter glutamate release from rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes is investigated. Two depolarization protocols are used: first, elevated KCl, which produces a clamped depolarization, and second, 4-aminopyridine, which evokes spontaneous action potentials allowing any potential modulation of Na+ or K+ channels to influence release. Although the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220 prevents both the depolarization-evoked and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu)-evoked phosphorylation of the major presynaptic PKC substrate, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, it is without effect on KCl-evoked Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release. Ro 31-8220 totally inhibits the Ca(2+)-dependent 4-aminopyridine-evoked release of glutamate in the presence and absence of PDBu and again decreases the phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. Ro 31-8220 strongly inhibits the 4-aminopyridine-evoked increase in [Ca2+] both in the presence and absence of PDBu and antagonizes the PDBu enhancement of depolarization. This indicates that PKC isoforms activatable by PDBu and sensitive to Ro 31-8220 play no discernable role in Ca(2+)-secretion coupling per se in cerebral cortical glutamatergic nerve terminals, but that the kinase plays a major role in regulating the depolarization of the terminal."
https://openalex.org/W1629865552,"Botulinum neurotoxin type A consists of a disulfide-linked light and heavy chain, with an intradisulfide present within the C-terminal half of the latter. The functional consequences of reducing these bonds and alkylating the thiols were investigated. Modification of free cysteine residues had no effect on the toxicity in mouse bioassays or on acetylcholine release in the mouse nerve-diaphragm and the buccal ganglion of Aplysia californica. However, reduction of the toxin prior to alkylation drastically decreased neuroparalytic potency; yet, this derivative inhibited transmitter release if injected directly into a presynaptic neuron in the Aplysia ganglion or added to bovine permeabilized adrenal chromaffin cells. Its antagonism of the action of botulinum neurotoxin A at mammalian motor nerve endings and Aplysia neurons indicates retention of the ability to bind to the toxin's productive ecto-acceptors. Thus, the abolition of the toxicity of extracellularly applied botulinum neurotoxin A by the cleavage of both disulfides, and the alkylation of the half-cystines involved, results from ineffective uptake. Modified forms of the isolated chains of botulinum neurotoxin A were utilized to determine which of the disulfides were necessary for internalization. Alkylation of the cysteines in the light and heavy chains, including those involved in the interchain bond but excluding those of the intact disulfide in the heavy chain, revealed that the intermolecular bond must be present, or the thiols concerned unmodified, for botulinum neurotoxin A to undergo membrane translocation into Aplysia neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1566451495,"Effect of heat shock on a glutathione-synthesizing enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), and ATP-dependent outward transport of glutathione S-conjugate was characterized using K562 erythroid cells. When K562 cells grown at 37 degrees C were shifted to 42 degrees C for 2 h, an approximate 1.7-fold increase in the activity of gamma-GCS was observed. Treatment of K562 cells with erythropoietin (EP) for 12 h resulted in a decrease in the activity of gamma-GCS to 64% of the control. However, responsiveness of this enzyme activity in the cells treated with EP to heat shock was similar to that in untreated cells. Changes in the immunological activity of gamma-GCS were also observed in parallel with those in the enzymatic activity. On Northern blot analysis of total RNAs isolated from the cells with human cDNA for gamma-GCS, a substantial induction of mRNA level was found by heat shock and a reduction of EP. These changes were modest but correlated to the mRNA expression of a heat shock protein, HSP 70. Heat shock also had an effect of 1.8-fold stimulation on glutathione S-conjugate transport in K562 cells previously incubated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Treatment of the cells with EP resulted in a decrease in this transport by 62%. Similarly, the levels of glutathione S-conjugate-stimulated Mg(2+)-ATPase, which enzyme is thought to be involved in the transport of glutathione S-conjugate, were responsive to heat shock and EP. These results suggest that glutathione synthesis and transport process of glutathione metabolites are responsive to heat shock and play a role in the defense system against stresses. It is also suggested that the regulatory site of the expression of these enzymes by heat shock is independent of that by EP."
https://openalex.org/W2065472092,"Staphylococcal nuclease is an enzyme with enormous catalytic power, accelerating phosphodiester bond hydrolysis by a factor of 10(16) over the spontaneous rate. The mechanistic basis for this rate acceleration was investigated by substitution of the active site residues Glu43, Arg35, and Arg87 with unnatural amino acid analogs. Two Glu43 mutants, one containing the nitro analog of glutamate and the other containing homoglutamate, retained high catalytic activity at pH 9.9, but were less active than the wild-type enzyme at lower pH values. The x-ray crystal structure of the homoglutamate mutant revealed that the carboxylate side chain of this residue occupies a position and orientation similar to that of Glu43 in the wild-type enzyme. The increase in steric bulk is accommodated by a backbone shift and altered torsion angles. The nitro and the homoglutamate mutants display similar pH versus rate profiles, which differ from that of the wild-type enzyme. Taken together, these studies suggest that Glu43 may not act as a general base, as previously thought, but may play a more complex structural role during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1548406095,"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a nonlysosomal metalloprotease involved in metabolizing internalized insulin, has catalytic properties that have been strongly conserved through evolution. Two major properties distinguish IDE from the prototypic metalloprotease thermolysin. 1) It is inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors as well as metalloprotease inhibitors; 2) it contains an inversion of the HEXXH active site motif of thermolysin, where the histidines coordinate zinc and the glutamate participates in catalysis. Furthermore, cysteine is adjacent to the glutamate residue (HXCEH) in human, rat, and Drosophila IDE, although it is not conserved in their close homologue, Escherichia coli protease III. This cysteine has been postulated to mediate the differential sensitivity of IDE and protease III to cysteine protease inhibitors and chelators. The role of the cysteine in IDE catalysis and inhibitor sensitivity was examined by mutating Cys110 to glycine or serine. To determine whether glutamate in this unusual motif participates in catalysis, we mutated Glu111 to aspartate, valine, or glutamine. Vectors containing wild type or mutant enzymes were transfected into COS cells, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting. Although the glutamate mutants were devoid of insulin degrading activity, the cysteine mutants were indistinguishable from wild type enzyme in both catalytic activity and sensitivity to inhibitors. The loss of activity in the glutamate mutants was not due to gross alterations in tertiary structure, as shown by retention of the ability to bind substrate and by conservative and nonconservative mutation of a neighboring residue with no apparent effect on catalysis. These results demonstrate that the conserved glutamate in the zinc-binding site of human insulin-degrading enzyme is a major catalytic residue, while a conserved cysteine in this region is not essential for catalysis or inhibitor sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1674446916,"To address mechanisms by which cytokines inhibit interferon-gamma (IFN gamma)-induced gene expression in astrocytic cells, we have been studying effects of type beta 1 transforming growth factor (TGF beta 1) and interferon-beta (IFN beta) on IFN gamma-induced expression of the well-characterized human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene DRA. This investigation was motivated by the observations that IFN gamma-induced expression of MHC class II antigen expression on astrocytic cells can be blocked in a tissue-specific fashion by several cytokines and neurotransmitters in tissue culture and that astrocyte expression of MHC class II is severely restricted in vivo. We previously showed that IFN beta inhibited IFN gamma-induced DRA expression at the transcriptional level. This inhibition was not global, since IFN gamma-induction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was not affected. Here, TGF beta 1-mediated inhibition of DRA is shown to exhibit similar characteristics. To address the mechanism of this inhibition, sequence requirements for IFN beta and TGF beta 1 to suppress IFN gamma-induced transcription of DRA were determined. A 135-base pair DRA sequence element containing the IFN gamma-responsive region and transcriptional start site was sufficient to direct IFN beta- or TGF beta 1-mediated suppression of a reporter gene. These experiments suggested that either IFN beta or TGF beta 1 could repress IFN gamma-induced DRA transcription directly, without requiring a cis-element extrinsic to the IFN gamma-inducible DRA sequences. Consistently similar effects of IFN beta and TGF beta 1 observed in these experiments prompted comparison of other gene regulatory effects of the two cytokines. TGF beta 1, unlike IFN beta, induced gene expression directed by upstream elements of the gene encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1. IFN beta, unlike TGF beta 1, enhanced levels of 2‘-5‘-oligoadenylate synthetase activity. Additionally, direct assay of TGF beta 1 and monoclonal anti-TGF beta antibody blocking experiments were used to determine that cells treated with IFN beta did not produce increased amounts of active or latent TGF beta. These data argued that IFN beta and TGF beta 1 utilized distinct pathways to mediate the inhibition of IFN gamma-induced DRA transcription."

Conversion of cleavable 125I-labeled single-chain proteins to their two-chain forms, was quantitated by radioisotope counting of protein bands on reduced SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The efficiency of the activation (moles of plasmin generated per mol of plasminogen activator) of native Glu-plasminogen bound to degraded fibrin was comparable for scu-PA and its two-chain form (tcu-PA) and approximately 4-fold lower for rscu-PA-Glu158. The corresponding values with rPg-Ala741 were 4-fold or 9-fold lower for scu-PA or rscu-PA-Glu158, as compared to tcu-PA. In contrast, in solution in the absence of fibrin, the efficiency of scu-PA for activation of rPg-Ala741 was 100-fold lower than that of tcu-PA. Initial activation rates of rPg-Ala741 (32.7 fmol/well containing 50 microliters of solution) with 4 nM tcu-PA were comparable in solution and bound to degraded fibrin (v(o) = 1.01 and 1.16 fmol/min, respectively). In contrast, with 4 nM scu-PA the corresponding values when rPg-Ala741 was bound to degraded fibrin were 20-fold higher as compared to the soluble phase (v(o) = 0.23 and 0.012 fmol/min, respectively). Comparable results were obtained when using Glu- or Lys-forms of rPg-Ala741. Furthermore, in the presence of normal human plasma, activation of Glu-plasminogen bound to degraded fibrin was found to be about 2.5-fold more efficient with scu-PA than with tcu-PA. These findings indicate that the fibrin specificity of scu-PA does not require its conversion to tcu-PA, nor conversion of Glu- to Lys-plasminogen, but appears to be due to the additional binding of plasminogen to partially digested fibrin; scu-PA may thus represent a physiological functional form of u-PA in plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2031346265,"Catfish horizontal cells exhibit a high voltage-activated, slowly inactivating calcium (HVA) current. In isolated cells, this current underlies a sustained action potential that can be evoked by depolarization. L-Glutamate at concentrations as low as 1 microM suppressed HVA current and shortened the duration of action potentials. pH indicator dye measurements revealed that L-glutamate acidified cells by up to 0.3 pH units. pH/HVA current dose-response curves indicated that the EC50 for pH inhibition of HVA current was 7.1 and the Hill coefficient was 1.98. L-Glutamate's suppression of HVA current was eliminated when the patch pipette solution contained a high concentration of proton buffer, but was not affected when pipettes contained GTP gamma S. These results support the hypothesis that L-glutamate can modulate HVA current by changing intracellular pH."
https://openalex.org/W1480805033,"Tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein (TRAMP) is a recently discovered protein that co-purifies with porcine skin lysyl oxidase and is equivalent to the M(r) 22,000 extracellular matrix protein from bovine skin that co-purifies with dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (Cronshaw, A. D., MacBeath, J. R. E., Shackleton, D. R., Collins, J. F., Fothergill-Gilmore, L. A., and Hulmes, D. J. S. (1993) Matrix 13, 255-266; Neame, P. J., Choi, H. U., and Rosenberg, L. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5474-5479). The effect of TRAMP on collagen fibril formation was studied in vitro by reconstitution of fibrils from lathyritic rat skin collagen I. Fibril formation was initiated by the warm start procedure, in which acidic collagen solutions and double strength neutral buffer, both preincubated separately at 34 degrees C, were mixed. When monitored by turbidimetry, TRAMP was found to accelerate collagen fibril formation. Acceleration occurred at sub-stoichiometric molar ratios of TRAMP collagen, and the presence of TRAMP stabilized the fibrils against low temperature dissociation. It was confirmed by centrifugation that the amount of fibrillar collagen formed in the presence of TRAMP was greater than in its absence. By SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and scanning densitometry, binding of TRAMP to collagen was detected that approached saturation with a molar ratio of TRAMP to collagen of approximately 1:2. Fibrils formed in the presence of TRAMP were normal when observed by electron microscopy, although fibril diameters were smaller than the controls. TRAMP was found to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of urea and increased ionic strength on the kinetics of fibril formation, although inhibition by glucose was unaffected. TRAMP also accelerated the assembly of pepsin-treated collagen, where the non-helical, telopeptide regions were partially removed. Acceleration of collagen fibril formation by TRAMP is discussed in the light of the known effects of other extracellular matrix components on this process."
https://openalex.org/W1576938023,"The paramyxovirus HN polypeptide is a model type II membrane protein, containing an internal uncleaved signal/anchor (S/A) and is oriented in the membrane with an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain and COOH-terminal ectodomain (Ncyt topology). To test the role of NH2-terminal positively charged residues in directing the HN membrane topology, the 3 arginine (Arg) residues within the 17-amino-acid NH2-terminal domain were systematically converted to a glutamine or glutamate, and the topology of the mutant proteins was examined after expression in CV-1 cells. The data indicate that: (i) each of the NH2-terminal Arg residues contributes to the signal directing proper HN topology, since substitutions in any of the three positions resulted in approximately 13-23% inversion into the Nexo form; (ii) substitutions in the Arg directly flanking the signal/anchor domain resulted in slightly more inversion than those which were located more distally; and (iii) substitution with a negatively charged glutamate led to more inversion than did replacement with an uncharged glutamine. The effect of a single Arg to Glu substitution on the HN topology was enhanced when present in the context of a truncated NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail (3 residues). A comparison of the sequences flanking the signal/anchor of well documented type III proteins showed that the majority of these proteins contain a negatively charged residue flanking the NH2-terminal side. An exception to this rule is the NB protein which contains a single positively charged Arg residue in this position. A chimeric protein containing the NB ectodomain and the HN S/A and HN ectodomain lead to a significant fraction (70%) of the chimeric protein adopting type II topology suggesting that the positive charge flanking the S/A domain is important for establishing type II topology. These data are discussed in the context of the loop model for the biogenesis of integral membrane proteins and the possible signals necessary for establishing differing orientations."
https://openalex.org/W6814163,"GroE, a chaperonin protein from Escherichia coli, facilitates the folding of numerous proteins by binding to protein-folding intermediates and suppressing aggregation (Gething, M., and Sambrook, J. (1992) Nature 355, 33-45). The specific mechanism of GroE-facilitated folding involves numerous interactions between GroEL, GroES, the refolding protein, and ATP. In the present study, we have probed the molecular characteristics of the refolding reaction of yeast enolase in the presence of GroE. We have found that (a) GroEL interacts specifically with enolase during the folding reaction, resulting in folding arrest; (b) the release of partially folded molecules of enolase from the GroE complex may be mediated by the addition of nucleotides other than ATP (ADP, CTP, and UTP); and (c) GroES is required for enolase to be released from GroEL in the presence of ADP, CTP, and UTP but not required in the presence of ATP. The nucleotide binding mechanism of GroEL and the specific role of GroES during the refolding reaction are discussed in detail."
https://openalex.org/W1601068357,"We studied the activation and inactivation of recombinant guanylyl cyclase (GC) C stably expressed in human kidney 293 cells. Activation of GC-C by heat-stable enterotoxin (STa), Cd2+, hemin, or the detergent Triton X-100 was followed by a rapid inactivation of the enzyme. Adenine nucleotides were found to prevent the inactivation process in native membranes, as well as following enzyme solubilization and immunopurification. Inactivation of GC-C was not associated with dephosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation of GC-C was promoted by phorbol esters, known activators of protein kinase C. The activation of purified GC-C by STa required the presence of a nonspecific factor as exemplified by bovine serum albumin. When immunopurified GC-C, stabilized by ATP and bovine serum albumin, was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, proteins with almost twice the molecular mass (220 and 245 kDa) of the monomer were observed. The mobility of these high M(r) GC-C forms was reduced by STa, suggesting that STa induces a conformation change in a preexisting GC-C dimer. These results indicate that ATP interacts directly with GC-C, stabilizing its active conformation and that the activation of GC-C may occur in the absence of other specific regulatory factors."
https://openalex.org/W1551592588,"The purpose of this study is to determine which pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gi) mediates alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) release. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were treated with pertussis toxin (0-100 ng/ml) for 16 h and stimulated with an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, UK14304, to release EDRF in a bioassay system. Pertussis toxin produced a concentration-dependent decrease in EDRF release with maximal inhibition (80%) occurring at 5 ng/ml. This correlated with a decrease in receptor-G protein coupling as measured by 87% loss of high affinity agonist binding sites and 94% decrease in agonist-stimulated GTPase activity. Immunoprecipitation of [32P]NAD-ribosylated membranes using specific Gi protein antisera demonstrated that complete ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha 2 occurred at 5 ng/ml compared to 30 ng/ml for Gi alpha 3. When bovine aortic endothelial cell membranes were treated with carboxyl terminus-directed antisera to Gi alpha 2 (P4) and Gi alpha 3 (EC), the P4 antisera abolished 86% of the high affinity agonist binding sites and 93% decrease in agonist-stimulated GTPase activity, while the EC antisera had minimal effect (12%). These results indicate that Gi alpha 2 mediates most of the EDRF released via the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1515435865,"Facilitation of protein folding by GroEL usually requires involvement of GroES and ATP. In their absence nascent proteins tend to be arrested on GroEL or, if released, fail to show enhancement of reactivation yield relative to that observed without the chaperonin. In contrast, the yield of reactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glu-6-PDH) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides at 20 degrees C is increased 2-3-fold (to over 80%) by GroEL alone. ATP greatly enhances the rate of GroEL-assisted reactivation and slightly increases its yield to 90%. The efficiency of the GroEL-assisted reactivation of Glu-6-PDH is strongly dependent on temperature. A switch from enhanced to fully arrested reactivation occurs over a narrow temperature range from 25 to 30 degrees C in the presence of GroEL when ATP is absent. At physiological temperature therefore, reactivation is fully arrested by GroEL if ATP is absent and in its presence the protein is released in a form not committed to correct folding. The data shows that the committing step in Glu-6-PDH refolding occurs while the nascent protein is bound to GroEL, a step which is temperature-sensitive. The extreme temperature sensitivity of this step indicates a sharp structural transition in GroEL."
https://openalex.org/W1508347544,"Adhesion is of pivotal importance for a number of leukocyte functions. Little is known about the binding between leukocyte integrins and the intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs). Normally integrins are nonadhesive, and require a stimulus to become active. We have now identified a peptide from ICAM-2, which binds to leukocyte integrins and activates adhesion. Furthermore, the peptide strongly increased the binding and cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. These findings show that adhesion-dependent leukocyte functions can be activated by ligand-derived peptides, and therefore provide evidence that the avidity of leukocyte integrins is up-regulated by integrin-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1482068539,"Abstract It is believed that there are several charged amino acid residues in membrane-spanning alpha-helices of the lactose carrier of Escherichia coli. Evidence has previously been presented for two different salt bridges in membrane-spanning regions of the lactose carrier. One of these involves an interaction between Asp-237 and Lys-358; another involves interaction between Asp-240 and Lys-319. Additional studies of Lys-319 suggest that it may interact with Glu-269 as well as Asp-240. A cell containing the LacY gene with the mutation Lys-319-->Asn failed to ferment melibiose and after several days melibiose-positive mutants arose on indicator plates. These revertants showed second site mutations which replaced Asp-240 by neutral amino acids (Val or Gly). In addition, a second site mutation showed Glu-269 changed to Asn. Cells containing the mutation Lys-319-->Leu also failed to ferment melibiose and melibiose-positive revertants showed Asp-240-->Ala and Asp-240-->Tyr as well as Tyr-236-->Phe and His-322-->Arg. Second site revertants were also sought from the mutant Glu-269-->Asn which grew poorly on melibiose minimal plates. Melibiose-positive revertants included the double mutant Gln-269/Asn-319. All of the Glu-269-->Asn mutants were extremely defective in transport. It was concluded that Lys-319 interacts with Glu-269 and Asp-240 probably as salt bridges."
https://openalex.org/W1561042802,"Previously, we described the purification of the catalytic core subunit of yeast DNA polymerase delta from Escherichia coli carrying the yeast POL3 gene cloned in a vector that allowed efficient expression. The basic catalytic properties of the single subunit enzyme are virtually identical to the heterodimeric core enzyme purified from yeast cells (Brown, W. C., Duncan, J. A., and Campbell, J. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 982-990). In this work, we investigate the ability of yeast proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to stimulate processive synthesis by the bacterially produced, single-subunit DNA polymerase delta. Yeast PCNA was found to stimulate the full-length single-subunit yeast DNA polymerase delta and to increase its processivity. A truncated version of DNA polymerase delta, from which the NH2-terminal 220 amino acids had been removed, was prepared and similarly investigated. While the catalytic properties of the truncated protein were nearly identical to those of the full-length enzyme, neither the extent of synthesis nor processivity was increased in the presence of PCNA. Thus, we conclude that the single-subunit DNA polymerase can associate productively with PCNA in the absence of other proteins and that the NH2-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit must be intact for this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1516548224,"Peptides containing sequences derived from the new NH2 terminus of the seven-transmembrane domain thrombin receptor after thrombin cleavage can activate platelets directly. We recently demonstrated that such peptides are readily cleaved and inactivated by plasma, serum, and endothelial cell-associated aminopeptidase M. The rapid degradation and inactivation of the peptides makes it difficult to assess dose-response relationships precisely or to conduct long term incubations with cells in the presence of plasma or serum. To overcome these problems, we first substituted D-serine for the NH2-terminal L-serine in an active peptide ligand (SFLLRNPNDKY). The D-serine derivative resisted degradation in plasma, but it is less than 1% as active as the L-serine peptide. Substituting a racemic mixture of the beta-amino acid isoserine for serine in a related peptide ligand (SFLLRN) produced an active peptide ((iso-S)FLLRN) that is approximately 15-20% as potent as SFLLRN as judged by platelet aggregation. To assess the stability of the peptides in plasma, SFLLRN (1 mM) was incubated with 50% plasma for various periods of time; after 15 min, 65% of the peptide remained intact, and after 2 h only 4% remained intact. Loss of aggregating activity paralleled the loss of intact peptide. In contrast, even after 2 h of incubation with plasma, 83% of the (iso-S)FLLRN remained intact and the aggregating activity was essentially unchanged. Qualitative differences in the patterns of platelet aggregation produced by the peptides were also observed. Thus, the distinct pattern of aggregation followed by rapid disaggregation observed with submaximal aggregating doses of SFLLRN was less evident with (iso-S)FLLRN, and inhibition of aminopeptidase M by amastatin enhanced aggregation in platelet-rich plasma induced by SFLLRN but not (iso-S)FLLRN. The (iso-S)FLLRN peptide should permit improved analysis of the effects of constant levels of peptide-induced thrombin receptor stimulation in the presence of plasma or serum, or when testing the effects of the peptide on cells that contain surface-associated aminopeptidase M."
https://openalex.org/W1514326901,"Abstract Factor XIIIa is a transglutaminase that catalyzes intermolecular gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysyl bonds between fibrin and other proteins involved in hemostasis. We synthesized 25 peptides from various regions of factor XIIIa and studied their effects on cross-linking fibrin, N,N'-dimethylcasein, or fibronectin. We found that two peptides, Asn72-Asp97 (peptide-4) and Asp190-Phe230 (peptide-7), inhibited factor XIIIa cross-linking of these substrates. The other peptides did not inhibit factor XIIIa activity. The inhibition of cross-linking was reversed by excess substrate, indicating that the peptides were interacting with fibrin and not factor XIIIa. The peptides were not pseudosubstrates since they were not cross-linked to fibrin. The peptides did not modify the primary amine binding site as increasing the primary amine concentration did not reverse inhibition. Peptides-4 and -7 also had no effect on exposure of the active site of factor XIIIa and no synergistic inhibitory effects were detected. Peptides-4 and -7 had no effect on factor XIIIa binding to fibrin suggesting that the binding sites and the substrate recognition sites were distinct. Synthetic peptides containing shorter amino acid sequences of peptide-4 were inactive. In contrast, the amino-terminal (Asp190-Lys199, Tyr194-Tyr204) and the carboxyl-terminal (Lys221-Phe230) portions of peptide-7 were 20-60-fold less inhibitory compared to intact peptide-7. Peptides-4 and -7 also inhibited guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase from cross-linking fibrinogen, N,N'-dimethylcasein, and fibronectin. In conclusion, we have identified two regions outside the active site pocket which are important for substrate recognition in factor XIIIa and tissue transglutaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1587763824,"We have previously reported that apolipoprotein (a) is a substrate for transglutaminases. We now demonstrate that plasminogen which is homologous to apolipoprotein (a), is also modified by these enzymes. Transglutaminases from different sources mediated the incorporation of monodansyl-cadaverine into plasminogen, indicating the presence of reactive glutamine(s) in plasminogen. Reactive lysines were also identified using the lysine-decorating peptide dansyl-PGGQQIV. In addition, transglutaminases catalyzed the formation of plasminogen homopolymers and plasminogen-fibronectin heteropolymers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cross-linked plasminogen into high molecular mass aggregates. Cross-linked plasminogen was cell associated, and no cross-linking of plasminogen was seen in the fluid-phase. Large molecular mass plasminogen generated on the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) surface could not be eluted with epsilon-aminocapoic acid and was activatable by tissue plasminogen activator. These results suggest that, following non-covalent association of plasminogen with the HUVEC surface, cell surface-associated transglutaminase catalyzes cross-linking of plasminogen into large molecular mass aggregates that can be converted into functional plasmin. It is proposed that transglutaminases may function to localize plasminogen to cell surfaces and matrices of tissues."
