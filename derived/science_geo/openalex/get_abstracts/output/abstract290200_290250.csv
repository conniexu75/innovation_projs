https://openalex.org/W1980554272,"Soils and recent marine sediments contain a complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon assemblage. There is a high degree of similarity in the molecular weight distribution of the many series of alkyl homologs of these aromatic hydrocarbons, and this distribution varies little over a wide range of depositional environments. The evidence suggests that these hydrocarbons are formed in natural fires, are dispersed and mixed by air transport, and are eventually deposited into surface sediments. The analytical, geochemical, and environmental implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1982944683,"The cardiac glycosides that monarch butterflies sequester from milkweed plants during the larval stage differ remarkably in their emetic potency and are concentrated to different degrees in the various parts of the body as well as in the two sexes (Fig. 1). The very high concentrations of these compounds in the wings probably facilitate learned taste rejection in predators and account for the relatively high frequency of Danaid butterflies with beak-marked wings in natural populations. The cardiac glycosides in the abdomen have a much higher emetic potency than those in the rest of the body. Consequently, naive, extremely hungry, or forgetful birds which capture and peck off the wings but eat the abdomen discard the least emetic glycosides and ingest the most emetic, and thus again experience emesis. The nonrandom distribution of cardenolides in the wings, abdomen, and thorax, together with the fact that monarch males not only contain lower concentrations of cardiac glycosides than females but also contain cardenolides that are overall less emetic than those in females, is interpreted as evidence that these poisons are incorporated at a physiological cost. This cost, balanced against the benefits of protection from predation, provides a selective basis for the occurrence of both emetic and nonemetic individuals in natural populations. Since birds can discriminate emetic from nonemetic monarchs on the basis of taste, it is not necessary to invoke theories of kind of group selection to explain the evolution of this kind of unpalatability."

The acidic components contain all, while the basic components contain none, of the exchangeable protons present. The significance of these findings with respect to coal structure and coal solubilization is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2060929140,"We have attempted to demonstrate a possible relationship between phosphorite deposition and an increase in marine denitrification. The studies of others indicate that major phosphorite deposits are often associated with black shales and accumulated during only a few epochs of geologic history. Some of these epochs were also marked by mass extinctions of organisms. Such events are not as precisely nor as strongly correlated as we would like. Nevertheless, the correlations are strong enough to encourage further consideration of the effects of possible changes in the rate of denitrification within ancient oceans on the origin of phosphorite deposits, the extinctions of marine organisms, variations in the overall level of biological activity, and temporal fluctuations in the organic carbon content of sedimentary rocks (36)."

https://openalex.org/W2009710214,"The belief that the use of fish fertilizers originated among North American Indians, and was communicated as such by Squanto to the Plymouth settlers, has achieved the status of folklore and is therefore difficult to challenge. However, examination of the documentary evidence of Squanto's history and of native cultivation practices, and a cultural analysis of the implications of the use of fish fertilizer, have produced complementary lines of evidence. This evidence indicates that widely held beliefs about the ""manner of the Indians"" should be revised: Squanto's advice at Plymouth is probably best viewed as an interesting example of culture contact, one in which a native ""culture-bearer"" conveyed a technological idea from one group of Europeans to another."

https://openalex.org/W2018266687,"Irregular, barren polygonal sheets of mud scattered over the landscape of the western portion of the Noatak River Delta are derived from lake-bottom sediments, ice-rafted during flooding. The evidence suggests that the sheets of mud change the albedo and the thermal regime of the soil, induce the development of thermokarst, and lead to the formation of ponds and lakes. The angular perimeters, especially of the small ponds, support the suggested mode of formation."

https://openalex.org/W2016330693,"Two articles discuss the recent experimental work of Hong et al. on the production of amino acids and gas-phase organic compounds from the ultraviolet irradiation of simple gases, with hot hydrogen atoms used as the principal energy conversion agent. The reaction possibilities involving frozen ices are mentioned in both articles, as well as the significance of three-body collisions in this situation."
https://openalex.org/W2023374830,"The usual augmenting action of pressure on the tension developed by striated muscle in response to a single stimulus changes to depression on fatiguing the muscle. On release of the pressure the tension of the single twitch again reaches the control value. A similar reversal may be brought about by cooling the muscle, the change usually occurring at about 13 degrees C. Below this temperature the depression is roughly proportional to the pressure. At about 1 degrees C. the tension development may be completely inhibited by high pressure. The muscle responds normally upon release of the pressure, and upon warming pressure again causes augmentation of contraction."

https://openalex.org/W4248519143,"In an article titled ""How safe is Bendectin?"" (31 Oct. 1980, p. 518), it was incorrectly reported that William McBride of Sydney, Australia, was paid $5000 a day to testify as an expert witness in a court case involving allegations that Bendectin caused birth defects in a Florida child named David Mekdeci. McBride was not paid for certain testimony. Rather, he was compensated for time away from his Australian practice at a rate of approximately $1116 a day so that he could appear as an expert witness on behalf of the Mekdeci family. He was also reimbursed for his travel expenses to and from Australia. Science regrets the error."
