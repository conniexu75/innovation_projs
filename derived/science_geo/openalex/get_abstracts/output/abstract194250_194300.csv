https://openalex.org/W2024806680,"ANTIBODIES labelled with fluorescent dyes have been used for histochemical localization of antigens in tissue sections by Coons and Kaplan1, Marshall2 and Hill and Cruickshank3. It would seem that this method might be applied to locate tissue antigens during the course of development."

https://openalex.org/W1974331784,"STUDIES on the pharmacology of extracts of Rauwolfia serpentina have been reported by Chopra, Gupta and Mukherjee1, Ray et al.2 and Dasgupta et al.3. Chopra, Gupta and Mukherjee1 reported that the alkaloid with which they were working had a marked hypotensive effect which was in part due to depression of central nervous mechanisms, since it was less marked in decerebrate animals, but appeared also to result in part from a direct inhibitory effect on the musculature of the blood vessels. They demonstrated also a fall in the output of the isolated heart. Most subsequent work has suggested that the hypotensive effect of Rauwolfia alkaloids is mediated solely via central nervous mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2016107142,SCHRADAN (octamethyl pyrophosphoramide) and parathion (OO-diethyl O p-nitrophenyl phosphorothionate) are converted by insects or mammals into inhibitors of cholinesterase. In mammals the liver is responsible for the metabolism of both compounds1 and the conversion appears to be an oxidative one.
https://openalex.org/W2072536048,"AFTER the chemical synthesis of thiamine phosphoric esters was achieved1–4, reports were published on their cocarboxylasic activity3–7. Investigations have shown that monophosphothiamine has no cocarboxylasic activity, but different values have been found for the activity of triphosphothiamine. The discrepancies may be accounted for by the facts that: (a) chemical synthesis provides mixtures of three esters (mono-, di- and tri-phosphoric) which are very difficult to separate; (b) diphosphothiamine is very active; and therefore quantities as small as 0.1 γ/ml. occurring as impurities with the other esters invalidate the results; (c) washed yeast, which has usually been employed as apoenzyme, makes it difficult to reproduce results."
https://openalex.org/W1988666322,"PRESENT methods of demonstrating ketosteroids in tissues are generally regarded as being unsatisfactory. 2-Hydroxy-3-naphthoyl hydrazide1 is the reagent most recently introduced for this purpose, yet it condenses only sluggishly with carbonyl groups and fails to distinguish between aldehydes and ketones. A number of phenolic hydrazides have since been tested. Of these, 2 : 4 dihydroxybenzoyl-hydrazide2 is better in that it provides azo-hydrazones of different colours in the ketosteroid group3, but it still lacks adequate condensing reactivity."

https://openalex.org/W2024764833,"IN an earlier communication1, a technique was described for obtaining consistent separations of the cytoplasmic proteins of rat liver using electrophoresis on filter paper. A notable improvement in resolution has been observed following the treatment of the protein mixtures with n-butanol. The use of this reagent was suggested by the experiments of Morton2 on the extraction of various enzymes from the particulate fractions of the cell structure."
