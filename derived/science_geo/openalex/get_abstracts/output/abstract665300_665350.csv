https://openalex.org/W3111998353,"Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process."

Finding host factors common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinases and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle and the development of host-directed therapies."

Although components of this pathway have been previously generated and studied in vitro, the assembly of this multi-synaptic circuit has not yet been achieved with human cells. Here, we derive organoids resembling the cerebral cortex or the hindbrain/spinal cord and assemble them with human skeletal muscle spheroids to generate 3D cortico-motor assembloids. Using rabies tracing, calcium imaging, and patch-clamp recordings, we show that corticofugal neurons project and connect with spinal spheroids, while spinal-derived motor neurons connect with muscle. Glutamate uncaging or optogenetic stimulation of cortical spheroids triggers robust contraction of 3D muscle, and assembloids are morphologically and functionally intact for up to 10 weeks post-fusion. Together, this system highlights the remarkable self-assembly capacity of 3D cultures to form functional circuits that could be used to understand development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3112951837,"The RNA binding protein TDP-43 forms intranuclear or cytoplasmic aggregates in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we found that RNA binding-deficient TDP-43 (produced by neurodegeneration-causing mutations or posttranslational acetylation in its RNA recognition motifs) drove TDP-43 demixing into intranuclear liquid spherical shells with liquid cores. These droplets, which we named ""anisosomes"", have shells that exhibit birefringence, thus indicating liquid crystal formation. Guided by mathematical modeling, we identified the primary components of the liquid core to be HSP70 family chaperones, whose adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent activity maintained the liquidity of shells and cores. In vivo proteasome inhibition within neurons, to mimic aging-related reduction of proteasome activity, induced TDP-43-containing anisosomes. These structures converted to aggregates when ATP levels were reduced. Thus, acetylation, HSP70, and proteasome activities regulate TDP-43 phase separation and conversion into a gel or solid phase."

Monocarboxylates, exemplified by lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies, are essential metabolites in most mammalian cells. Transmembrane movement of monocarboxylates is vital for cells that rely on glycolysis for energy supply (Halestrap et al., 1990Halestrap A.P. Poole R.C. Cranmer S.L.

Dynamic absorption and redistribution of these metabolites is executed by two types of monocarboxylate transporters in human, the proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (Garcia et al., 1994Garcia C.K.

Structural Biology of the Major Facilitator Superfamily Transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Among the fourteen identified MCTs, MCT1-MCT4 catalyze proton-coupled influx or efflux of monocarboxylate (Halestrap and Meredith, 2004Halestrap A.P. Meredith D.

Proper localization and function of MCT1-4 requires glycosylated chaperon proteins, such as Basigin (also known as CD147 or EMMPRIN) for MCT1/3/4 and Embigin (also known as gp70) for MCT2 (Halestrap and Wilson, 2012Halestrap A.P.

Under physiological conditions, MCT1-4 cooperate to form a lactate shuttling system that maintains lactate homeostasis between glycolytic and oxidative cells. Lactate exported from glycolytic cells is taken by oxidative cells for aerobic metabolism, as observed between the white-glycolytic and red-oxidative cells in skeleton muscles, and between astrocytes and neurons in the brain (Brooks, 2018Brooks G.A.

Van Hée V.F. Porporato P.E. Sonveaux P. Monocarboxylate transporters in cancer.Mol. Metab. 2020; 33: 48-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). While glycolytic cancer cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis to adapt to the hypoxic environment, oxidative cancer cells take in lactate secreted from glycolytic cancer cells for energy supply, a hypothesis known as the “metabolic symbiosis,” wherein MCT1 and MCT4 play a critical role for lactate shuttling (Pisarsky et al., 2016Pisarsky L. Bill R. Fagiani E. Dimeloe S. Goosen R.W. Hagmann J. Hess C. Christofori G.

Similarly, oxidative cancer cells, by forcing the adjacent stromal fibroblasts to adopt aerobic glycolysis, acquire additional lactate supply via MCT1/4-mediated lactate shuttling (Pavlides et al., 2009Pavlides S.

In addition to being directly involved in metabolism, lactate influx in vascular endothelial cells serves as a signal to promote tumor angiogenesis (De Saedeleer et al., 2012De Saedeleer C.J.

Excess lactic acid in the extracellular niche of tumor, secreted through MCT1 and 4, confers immune tolerance to cancer cells (Dietl et al., 2010Dietl K. Renner K. Dettmer K. Timischl B. Eberhart K.

Owing to the critical functions of lactate in cancer development, intervention of lactate metabolism by inhibiting MCTs represents a promising strategy for chemotherapy (Bola et al., 2014Bola B.M.

Early-age MCTs inhibitors, such as phloretin and quercetin, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, and 4,4’-di-iso-thiocyanostilbene-2,2’-disulfonate, are generally of low affinity and poor specificity (Carpenter and Halestrap, 1994Carpenter L.

Recently, three classes of more potent MCT1 inhibitors, exemplified by AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, have been reported with IC50 or Ki at nM range (Draoui et al., 2013Draoui N. Schicke O.

It was reported to inhibit MCT1 and MCT2 with Kd of ∼1.6 nM and ∼9.6 nM, respectively, but showed no effect on MCT4 (Critchlow et al., 2012Critchlow S.E. Hopcroft L. Mooney L. Curtis N. Whalley N.

Competitive inhibition of MCT1 by AZD3965 and BAY-8002 indicated a similar binding site for these two ligands (Quanz et al., 2018Quanz M. Bender E. Kopitz C. Grünewald S. Schlicker A. Schwede W.

Cancer Ther. 2018; 17: 2285-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 7ACC2 inhibits lactate influx, but not efflux in MCT1/4-expressing cancer cells, suggesting a mode of action (MOA) different from AR-C155858 (Draoui et al., 2013Draoui N. Schicke O. Fernandes A. Drozak X. Nahra F. Dumont A. Douxfils J. Hermans E. Dogné J.M.

Cancer Ther. 2014; 13: 1410-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An advanced understanding of the MOA of these inhibitors requires high-resolution structures of MCTs. A model of inward-open rat MCT1 (rMCT1) in complex with AR-C155858 was computationally constructed (Nancolas et al., 2015Nancolas B. Sessions R.B. Halestrap A.P. Identification of key binding site residues of MCT1 for AR-C155858 reveals the molecular basis of its isoform selectivity.Biochem. J. 2015; 467: 192Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of lactate-bound SfMCT, a prokaryotic homolog of human MCT1 from Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans, was resolved at 2.6 Å in an outward-open conformation (Bosshart et al., 2019Bosshart P.D. Kalbermatter D. Bonetti S. Fotiadis D. Mechanistic basis of L-lactate transport in the SLC16 solute carrier family.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, a cryo-EM structure of homodimeric MCT2 was reported at 3.8 Å in an inward-open state (Zhang et al., 2020Zhang B. Jin Q. Xu L. Li N. Meng Y. Chang S. Zheng X. Wang J. Chen Y. Neculai D. et al.Cooperative transport mechanism of human monocarboxylate transporter 2.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). But neither structure provides information on the chaperons Basigin or Embigin (Halestrap and Wilson, 2012Halestrap A.P. Wilson M.C. The monocarboxylate transporter family--role and regulation.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar; Kirk et al., 2000Kirk P. Wilson M.C. Heddle C. Brown M.H.

CD147 is tightly associated with lactate transporters MCT1 and MCT4 and facilitates their cell surface expression.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). More importantly, experimental structures are required to reveal the accurate binding site of the inhibitors to facilitate drug discovery. Here, we report four cryo-EM structures of the wild type (WT) human MCT1/Basigin-2 complex separately bound to lactate and the three prototypal MCT inhibitors, AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, all at 3.0–3.3 Å resolutions. We also solved the structure of a proton-coupling mutant MCT1(D309N)/Basigin-2 at 3.3 Å resolution. These structures and extensive biochemical characterizations provide an unprecedented understanding of the working and inhibition mechanism of MCT proteins, which will facilitate drug discovery for cancer treatment. Human MCT1, WT or the mutant D309N, and Basigin-2 were co-expressed in Sf9 cells and purified through tandem affinity and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure S1A). For cryo-sample preparation, the purified proteins were supplemented with L-lactate at a final concentration of 50 mM or the three inhibitors, AZD3965, BAY-8002, and 7ACC2, each at 600 μM. Details for cryo-sample preparation and cryo-EM data acquisition can be found in STAR Methods (Figures S1A and S1B). The electron micrographs, 2D class averages, and initial model all showed a thick detergent micelle and a flexible extracellular domain (ECD) that likely belonged to the two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains in Basigin-2 (Figure S1B). The small size (∼85 kD) and lack of a stable soluble domain posed major technical challenges for data processing. Conventional image processing methods failed to yield 3D reconstructions beyond 15 Å resolution. To overcome these technical barriers, we developed a strategy that combined noise reduction and re-weighting methods with our previously developed “guided multi-reference 3D classification” (Zhang et al., 2017Zhang X.

This strategy, presented in detail in STAR Methods, effectively eliminated the strong noises and identified good particles (Figures S1, S2, and S3).Figure S3Cryo-EM structural determination of the human MCT1/Basigin-2 complex in the presence of lactate or small molecule inhibitors, related to Figure 1, Table S1, and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A) Cryo-EM analysis of AZD3965-bound MCT1/Basigin-2 (MCT1A).

A “seed”-facilitated 3D classification and CTF refinement strategy further improved the resolutions of the transmembrane (TM) region to 3.0–3.3 Å according to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion (Figures 1A–1D, Figures S2, S3, and S4; Table S1). For the structure of lactate bound MCT1/Basigin-2 complex, additional refinement was performed with an overall mask in RELION (Zivanov et al., 2018Zivanov J. Nakane T. Forsberg B.O. Kimanius D.

For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to the five complexes as MCT1L (with lactate), MCT1N (with the D309N), MCT1A (with AZD3965), MCT1B (with BAY-8002), and MCT1C (with 7ACC2).Figure S4Cryo-EM analysis of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex bound to lactate or small molecule inhibitors, related to Figure 1, Table S1, and STAR MethodsShow full caption(A, D, G, J, M) Gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curve for the 3D refinement of the overall structure of the MCT1/Basigin-2 complex in the presence of lactate (red), AZD3965 (green), BAY-8002 (cyan), and 7ACC2 (purple), and the MCT1 (D309N)/Basigin-2 complex (black).

Secondary structural elements and most side chains in the TM region were clearly resolved, allowing for assignment of ∼410 side chains in the heterodimeric complex (Figures 1A–1D, Table S1). Consistent with its flexibility, the resolution of the ECD in Basigin-2 is much lower, only allowing for backbone tracing of the TM-connected Ig2 and rigid-body docking of the distal Ig1 (Figure 1B). The five structures exhibit two major conformations, outward-open for MCT1L/A/B, and inward-open for MCT1N/C (Figure 1A). We will discuss the alternating access changes in a later session. The overall structure of the TM region in all complexes is approximately 100 Å in height and 50 Å in the longest dimension of width. MCT1 contains 12 TMs that conform to the canonical MFS fold (Figure 1A). The single TM of Basigin-2 contacts TM6 of MCT1 mostly through hydrophobic interactions (Figures 1E and 1F). A membrane embedded hydrogen bond (H-bond) is found between Basigin-2(Glu218) and MCT1(Asn187), consistent with the previous report that Basigin-2(Glu218) is critical for MCT engagement (Manoharan et al., 2006Manoharan C. Wilson M.C. Sessions R.B. Halestrap A.P. The role of charged residues in the transmembrane helices of monocarboxylate transporter 1 and its ancillary protein basigin in determining plasma membrane expression and catalytic activity.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 486-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). Sequence analysis shows that Asn187 is conserved in MCT1/2/4, while MCT3 has a His at the corresponding locus. The polar residue His should still be H-bonded with Glu218 of Basigin-2 (Figure 1F, right, Figure S5). On the other hand, Embigin, the MCT2 chaperon, also has a Glu at the position equivalent to Basigin-2(Glu218). Therefore, the polar pair should be conserved between MCT1-4 and their chaperons to protect the polar residue on TM6 from the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. To validate this essential polar interaction, two variants, MCT1(N187A) and Basigin-2(E218A), were generated. Basigin-2(E218A) could not be detected in our expression system. When co-expressed, only residual amount of WT Basigin-2 was found in complex with MCT1-N187A (Figure 1G, Lanes 1 and 2), validating the importance of the polar pair in stabilizing the complex. In the structure of MCT1L, the amino and carboxyl terminal domains (NTD and CTD) enclose a cavity that opens to the extracellular side, a state defined as outward-open (Figure 2A). The central pock"

To tackle this challenge, Kuchina et al. developed microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics, or microSPLiT, a single-cell sequencing method for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Sequencing both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis showed differences in the heat shock response. Examining B. subtilis transcriptional patterns revealed that a small fraction of cells grown in laboratory medium express a myo-inositol catabolism pathway, which the cell could use in nonlaboratory environments, thus highlighting how microSPLiT can identify rare cellular states.

The nervous and immune systems have been viewed traditionally as functionally and anatomically distinct even though they share a critical common task: to detect and respond to internal and external threats that may be physical, chemical, or biological in nature. The nervous system has a direct role in avoidance of potentially injurious or infectious situations, whereas the immune system provides key resistance and repair mechanisms. Neuro-immune interactions have been investigated in a number of settings, especially in the central nervous system (CNS) (Klein et al., 2017Klein R.S. Garber C. Howard N.

However, the mechanisms and consequences of these multi-faceted interactions are still poorly understood. Best recognized for their sensory role, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons provide the CNS with information from the periphery through direct innervation of peripheral tissues. Traditional structural and functional characterization of sensory neurons and, more recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)-based molecular profiling have revealed a high degree of heterogeneity among somatosensory neurons (Sharma et al., 2020Sharma N.

In many cases, nociceptor modulation of immunity involves bioactive neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which are released from activated peripheral terminals of nociceptors and act on various immune and stromal cells that express the corresponding receptors (Assas et al., 2014Assas B.M.

Peptidergic neurons of putative sensory origin innervate most, if not all, secondary lymphoid organs and barrier tissues, but their density, pattern of innervation, and neighboring cell types are notably different between tissues (Belvisi, 2002Belvisi M.G.

This raises the intriguing possibility that sensory neurons targeting distinct peripheral sites may contribute differently to immune responses by engaging in local tissue-specific sensory neuro-immune circuits. Indeed, recent work has uncovered a key role of nociceptors in shaping immune activity in major barrier tissues, as evidenced by animal models of asthma, colitis, psoriasis, and infectious disease (Baral et al., 2019Baral P.

To date, the immunomodulatory effect of nociceptors has been documented primarily in the context of innate immune responses, where pro- and anti-inflammatory activities are observed. For instance, nociceptors in the skin can sense invading bacteria and attenuate inflammatory responses against bacterial infections (Chiu et al., 2013Chiu I.M. Heesters B.A. Ghasemlou N. Von Hehn C.A. Zhao F. Tran J. Wainger B. Strominger A. Muralidharan S. Horswill A.R. et al.Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation.Nature. 2013; 501: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Conversely, upon topical exposure to imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, dermal dendritic cells (DCs) require signals from cutaneous nociceptors to produce interleukin (IL)-23, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives psoriasiform dermatitis (Riol-Blanco et al., 2014Riol-Blanco L. Ordovas-Montanes J. Perro M. Naval E. Thiriot A. Alvarez D. Paust S. Wood J.N. von Andrian U.H. Nociceptive sensory neurons drive interleukin-23-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation.Nature. 2014; 510: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both studies report that nociceptors also affect regional lymph nodes (LNs); systemic nociceptor ablation prior to a bacterial infection caused a profound increase in lymphoid and myeloid LN cellularity (Chiu et al., 2013Chiu I.M. Heesters B.A. Ghasemlou N. Von Hehn C.A. Zhao F. Tran J. Wainger B. Strominger A. Muralidharan S. Horswill A.R. et al.Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation.Nature. 2013; 501: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), whereas, upon imiquimod exposure, the absence of nociceptors reduced LN cellularity (Riol-Blanco et al., 2014Riol-Blanco L. Ordovas-Montanes J. Perro M. Naval E. Thiriot A. Alvarez D. Paust S. Wood J.N. von Andrian U.H. Nociceptive sensory neurons drive interleukin-23-mediated psoriasiform skin inflammation.Nature. 2014; 510: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In both settings, nociceptors were globally ablated, so it is unclear whether the observed effects were due to loss of sensory innervation in the LNs themselves or in the surrounding non-lymphoid tissues. LNs act as sentinel organs that collect, filter, and monitor the constant flow of interstitial fluid (lymph) that is drained from peripheral tissues by afferent lymph vessels. LNs are the principal initiation sites for adaptive immune responses and are required for maintenance of peripheral tolerance to self-antigens (Buettner and Bode, 2012Buettner M. Bode U.

Secondary lymphoid organs are important but not absolutely required for allograft responses.Am. J. Transplant. 2003; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Generation of local adaptive immune responses against immunogens critically depends on bidirectional information flow between the peripheral site of initial immune challenge and the draining LNs, where antigen acquisition/presentation and subsequent lymphocyte differentiation and maturation are orchestrated. This process relies on directed transport of antigen-presenting cells, cytokines, and antigens via afferent lymph vessels from the periphery and selective recruitment of vast numbers of naive and memory lymphocytes from the blood via high endothelial venules (HEVs). Within LNs, specialized endothelial and stromal cells delineate the lymph conduits and organize the extravascular space into discrete anatomic domains. In addition, a variety of myeloid leukocytes cooperate to support efficient antigen encounters by B and T cells to elicit an appropriate immunogenic or tolerogenic response. Previous studies of LNs in several mammalian species have shown that LNs are innervated by noradrenergic and peptidergic neurons (Felten et al., 1985Felten D.L. Felten S.Y. Carlson S.L.

In animal models of arthritis and contact hypersensitivity, local application of capsaicin, a neurotoxin that targets TRPV1 (transient receptor potential channel-vanilloid subfamily member 1), attenuates inflammatory responses, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role for capsaicin-sensitive sensory innervation of LNs (Felten et al., 1992Felten D.L.

Olofsson P.S. Talbot S. Tsaava T. Ochani M. Imperato G.H. Levine Y.A. Roth J. Pascal M.A. Foster S.L. et al.Neuronal circuits modulate antigen flow through lymph nodes.Bioelectron. Med. 2016; 3: 18-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation, together with studies in sheep that showed a stimulatory effect of a neuropeptide, substance P, on lymph flow and lymphocyte recirculation through peripheral LNs (Moore et al., 1989Moore T.C. Lami J.L. Spruck C.H. Substance P increases lymphocyte traffic and lymph flow through peripheral lymph nodes of sheep.Immunology. 1989; 67: 109-114PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that modulation of lymphatic trafficking may be one of the mechanisms by which putative sensory innervation could locally regulate immune responses in LNs. Nonetheless, sensory neuron-immune interactions in LNs have yet to be established definitively and studied systematically. Here, by integrating state-of-the-art imaging, retrograde labeling, scRNA-seq, and optogenetics, we mapped sensory neuronal, immune and stromal components of skin-draining LNs. We found that sensory neurons innervate LNs with a preferential distribution toward the LN periphery, the region most prone to undergo rapid inflammation-induced mechanical, chemical, and cellular changes. Using scRNA-seq of retrogradely labeled DRG neurons, we identified four molecularly distinct LN-innervating sensory neuronal subtypes with strong enrichment for peptidergic nociceptors. Moreover, we found that LN-innervating neurons expressed a specific set of inflammatory molecules and receptors and could undergo structural remodeling following cutaneous challenge with direct (TLR4) and indirect (TLR1/2) agonists. This suggests that peripheral inflammatory signals are conveyed to LN-innervating neurons via additional secondary mediators, potentially through communication with other LN-resident cell types. To nominate the putative cellular communication partners of these sensory neurons, we used Seq-Well-based scRNA-seq to generate a single-cell “atlas” of murine steady-state LNs. By in-silico-matching known ligands and receptors expressed by LN-innervating sensory neurons and each LN-resident stromal and immune subset, we determined that stromal cells exhibit the highest potential for interaction with local sensory fibers. Finally, using optogenetic triggering, we first stimulated LN-innervating sensory neurons and then profiled LN-resident cell types using single-cell transcriptomics to identify the LN-resident cells most responsive to neuronal activity, including lymphatic endothelial cells, non-HEV blood endothelial cells, non-endothelial stroma, and certain populations of innate leukocytes, confirming our predictions. Our results define the anatomical and molecular identity of a previously enigmatic population of sensory neurons that innervate LNs and uncover a sensory neuron-stroma axis in steady-state LNs. The experimental and computational frameworks and foundational datasets established in this study should be broadly applicable to future analysis of neural circuits in a wide variety of tissues. To establish whether, where, and to what extent LNs are innervated by sensory neurons, we pursued several complementary strategies. First, we labeled peripheral neurons of sensory lineage, including nociceptors, with tdTomato using “knockin” mice that expressed Cre recombinase under control of the Nav1.8 locus, which encodes a nociceptor-enriched voltage-gated sodium channel (Nassar et al., 2004Nassar M.A. Stirling L.C. Forlani G. Baker M.D. Matthews E.A. Dickenson A.H. Wood J.N. Nociceptor-specific gene deletion reveals a major role for Nav1.7 (PN1) in acute and inflammatory pain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 12706-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). To visualize the complete 3D morphology of nerve fibers within intact popliteal LNs (popLNs) from these animals, we used a protocol adapted from a previously described tissue imaging method, immunolabeling-enabled 3D imaging of solvent-cleared organs (iDISCO; STAR Methods; Renier et al., 2014Renier N. Wu Z. Simon D.J. Yang J. Ariel P. Tessier-Lavigne M. iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 896-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). By co-staining for tdTomato and the pan-neuronal marker β3-tubulin, tdTomato+ nerve fibers, presumably originating from sensory neurons, were readily detectable as a major component of the neuronal architecture within and in the immediate vicinity of popLNs, particularly at the hilus (Figure 1A; Video S1). Consistent with previous studies that describe sympathetic innervation of LNs (Bellinger et al., 1992Bellinger D.L. Lorton D. Felten S.Y. Felten D.L.

Noradrenergic and peptidergic innervation of lymphoid tissue.J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 755s-765sPubMed Google Scholar), popLNs also contained a sizeable population of tdTomato– neuronal fibers that expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a prototypical marker for sympathetic neurons (Figure 1B; Video S1). In comparison, cholinergic parasympathetic fibers genetically labeled with GFP in ChATBAC-EGFP animals, where EGFP expression was driven by endogenous choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) transcriptional regulatory elements within a transgene, were never observed in LNs, even though scattered GFP+ cells were detectable in LNs, likely representing previously described ChAT+ immune cells (Reardon et al., 2013Reardon C.

Immunopharmacol. 1992; 14: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the primary path of nerve entry into LNs closely tracked the major blood vessels that entered the LN in the hilus region (Figure 1B; Video S1). Incoming nerve fibers preferentially traveled along a subset of blood vessels that were identified as small arteries and arterioles based on selective genetic labeling in Bmx-CreERT2 × Rosa26eYFP/+mice in which arterial endothelial cells (ECs) express YFP (Ehling et al., 2013Ehling M. Adams S. Benedito R. Adams R.H. Notch controls retinal blood vessel maturation and quiescence.Development. 2013; 140: 3051-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; Figure S1B). In the LNs, the arborization pattern of tdTomato– TH+ (putative sympathetic) neurons was notably distinct from that of tdTomato+ TH– (putative sensory) neurons. Although TH+ neurons primarily innervated the vasculature and often wrapped tightly around blood vessels, tdTomato+ fibers displayed a different terminal morphology and not only aligned with vasculature but also branched extensively into the interstitial space (Figure 1B; Video S1).Figure S1Confirmation of specific labeling of sensory and sympathetic innervation of LN with Nav1.8Cre and TH, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) 3D reconstruction of a representative confocal image of whole-mount popLNs from ChATBAC-eGFP animals, where cholinergic cells are genetically labeled with GFP, stained for β3-Tubulin (red), GFP (green).

Existing drugs have limited efficacy; creation of improved versions will require better understanding of serotonergic circuitry, which has been hampered by our inability to monitor serotonin release and transport with high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed and applied a binding-pocket redesign strategy, guided by machine learning, to create a high-performance, soluble, fluorescent serotonin sensor (iSeroSnFR), enabling optical detection of millisecond-scale serotonin transients. We demonstrate that iSeroSnFR can be used to detect serotonin release in freely behaving mice during fear conditioning, social interaction, and sleep/wake transitions. We also developed a robust assay of serotonin transporter function and modulation by drugs. We expect that both machine-learning-guided binding-pocket redesign and iSeroSnFR will have broad utility for the development of other sensors and in vitro and in vivo serotonin detection, respectively."

Yang et al. studied changes in myelination in the mouse visual cortex in response to visual experience (see the Perspective by Yalçin and Monje). With normal vision, myelination is continuously remodeled. As ocular dominance shifts in response to monocular deprivation, myelination patterns change on certain inhibitory interneurons but not on excitatory callosal projection neurons. Myelin sheaths are both added and subtracted, segments of myelin elongate and contract, and preexisting oligodendrocytes make new myelin sheaths. This adaptive myelination helps to diversify neuronal function and remodel neuronal circuits in response to sensory experience. Science , this issue p. eabd2109 ; see also p. 1414"
https://openalex.org/W3111294797,"Hippocampal output influences memory formation in the neocortex, but this process is poorly understood because the precise anatomical location and the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that perirhinal input, predominantly to sensory cortical layer 1 (L1), controls hippocampal-dependent associative learning in rodents. This process was marked by the emergence of distinct firing responses in defined subpopulations of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons whose tuft dendrites receive perirhinal inputs in L1. Learning correlated with burst firing and the enhancement of dendritic excitability, and it was suppressed by disruption of dendritic activity. Furthermore, bursts, but not regular spike trains, were sufficient to retrieve learned behavior. We conclude that hippocampal information arriving at L5 tuft dendrites in neocortical L1 mediates memory formation in the neocortex."

By contrast, Klein tunneling can exhibit unity transmission that is independent of the width and height of the energy barrier, but direct evidence for this effect remains elusive. Using a phononic system comprising a periodic array of dielectric pillars, Jiang et al. provide evidence for the direct observation of Klein tunneling. Near-unity transmission of acoustic excitations was observed across the barrier independently of its width and height. This ability to tune the effect by controlling the size of the junctions and the frequency of incident waves provides a promising platform to explore complex nontrivial physics and applications in signal processing and information communications.

They observed cryptic microbial sulfate reduction, which forms organic sulfur that is resistant to acid hydrolysis, a process that could enhance carbon preservation in sediments underlying oxygen-deficient water columns.

https://openalex.org/W3112249315,"The death of photoreceptor cells in dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) is closely associated with disruption in all-trans-retinal (atRAL) clearance in neural retina. In this study, we reveal that the overload of atRAL leads to photoreceptor degeneration through activating ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic form of cell death. Ferroptosis of photoreceptor cells induced by atRAL resulted from increased ferrous ion (Fe2+), elevated ACSL4 expression, system Xc- inhibition, and mitochondrial destruction. Fe2+ overload, tripeptide glutathione (GSH) depletion, and damaged mitochondria in photoreceptor cells exposed to atRAL provoked reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which, together with ACSL4 activation, promoted lipid peroxidation and thereby evoked ferroptotic cell death. Moreover, exposure of photoreceptor cells to atRAL activated COX2, a well-accepted biomarker for ferroptosis onset. In addition to GSH supplement, inhibiting either Fe2+ by deferoxamine mesylate salt (DFO) or lipid peroxidation with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) protected photoreceptor cells from ferroptosis caused by atRAL. Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice exhibiting defects in atRAL clearance is an animal model for dry AMD and STGD1. We observed that ferroptosis was indeed present in neural retina of Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice after light exposure. More importantly, photoreceptor atrophy and ferroptosis in light-exposed Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice were effectively alleviated by intraperitoneally injected Fer-1, a selective inhibitor of ferroptosis. Our study suggests that ferroptosis is one of the important pathways of photoreceptor cell death in retinopathies arising from excess atRAL accumulation and should be pursued as a novel target for protection against dry AMD and STGD1."

Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a chronic disorder with increasing prevalence in the Western world but lacks pharmacological therapies. Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) maintain a quiescent fibroblast phenotype in healthy heart valves (1Aikawa E. Libby P. A rock and a hard place: chiseling away at the multiple mechanisms of aortic stenosis.Circulation. 2017; 135: 1951-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which when challenged by pathologic stimuli, undergo myofibroblastic or osteoblastic differentiation, promoting tissue fibrosis and calcification leading to CAVD and aortic stenosis (AS) (1Aikawa E.

While apolipoproteins and apolipoprotein-associated molecules have been implicated in various studies of CAVD, there has not been an unbiased systematic study of apolipoprotein prevalence in human CAVD, and mechanistic roles of apolipoproteins in CAVD are poorly defined. Here, we sought to assess whether apolipoproteins contribute to CAVD pathogenesis by quantitatively mapping apolipoproteins across CAVD tissues that represent disease progression and evaluating calcification effects of select commercially available purified human apolipoproteins as an in vitro proof of concept. To characterize the human AV apolipoprotein distribution across different CAVD tissues, we leveraged the availability of CAVD stage proteomics data (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T. Rogers M.A. Sharma A. Seidman C.E. Loscalzo J. et al.Spatiotemporal multi-omics mapping generates a molecular atlas of the aortic valve and reveals networks driving disease.Circulation. 2018; 138: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to focus our analysis on apolipoproteins. These segments were defined by three major CAVD tissues: nonfibrotic/noncalcific (NF/NC), fibrotic (F), and calcific (C). We noted the prevalence of several apolipoproteins in calcific CAVD tissue (Fig. 1A), including several classical apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I, apoA-II, apoC-III, and apoB (Fig. 1A). We extracted all classical apolipoproteins (26Alaupovic P. Significance of apolipoproteins for structure, function, and classification of plasma lipoproteins.Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 32-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the global proteome data set (Table S1) and compared their abundance profiles using their sum-normalized distributions (Fig. 1B). Two phenomena were observed: (1) eight apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoB, apoC-III, apoD, apoL-I, and apoM) were enriched in the calcific CAVD tissue relative to the NF/NC, and some also relative to the fibrotic CAVD tissue (Fig. 1B) and (2) four apolipoproteins (apo(a), apoE, apoH, and apoJ) displayed no significant alterations across CAVD tissues (Fig. 1B). We followed up on these findings by employing a targeted MS application of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) to quantify the relative abundances of between one to three peptides for these 12 apolipoproteins identified in the global proteome in AV samples from five donors. We first validated a previously established peptide library (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T.

We also reanalyzed global RNA-Seq data from three CAVD donor leaflets (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T.

Loscalzo J. et al.Spatiotemporal multi-omics mapping generates a molecular atlas of the aortic valve and reveals networks driving disease.Circulation. 2018; 138: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to specifically determine whether prevalence of apolipoproteins in calcific CAVD tissue could be due to altered levels in local transcription; however, while some apolipoprotein genes tended to increase in the calcific CAVD tissue, only apoE was significantly changed (Fig. 1C). The gene that encodes apoJ (CLU) was significantly decreased in calcific CAVD tissue (Fig. 1C). This disconnect between valvular transcriptomics and proteomics quantification of apolipoproteins is consistent with global trends that we demonstrated previously (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T. Rogers M.A. Sharma A. Seidman C.E. Loscalzo J. et al.Spatiotemporal multi-omics mapping generates a molecular atlas of the aortic valve and reveals networks driving disease.Circulation. 2018; 138: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to our CAVD tissue proteomics analysis examination of relative abundances of apolipoproteins across disease progression, we used immunohistochemistry to identify the spatial localization of apolipoproteins throughout the AV interstitium and their association with extracellular matrix and calcification. ApoC-III, apo(a), apoB, and to a lesser extent apoJ and apoE exhibited a prominent and diffuse signal in collagen-enriched matrix of the disease-prone fibrosa layer (Fig. 2, fibrosa panel). In addition, these apolipoproteins were highly abundant around calcific regions (Fig. 2, calcification panel). Of note, the tissue distribution of apo(a) and apoJ appeared more diffuse and not strictly limited to calcification. ApoA-I, apoA-II, apoA-IV, apoD, and apoM colocalized with calcification deposits in the fibrosa layer but were not enriched in the noncalcified extracellular matrix of the fibrosa layer. ApoJ immunofluorescence demonstrated both cellular and extracellular expression patterns (Fig. 3A), particularly in collagen-rich fibrosa, with high immunofluorescence signal in and around α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive cells and vimentin-positive cells, suggesting heightened expression by myofibroblast-like VICs (Fig. 3A). While lipid-containing macrophage foam cells were largely lacking within diseased AV portions, immunoreactive apoD colocalized with a limited number of CD68-positive macrophages (Fig. 3B). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) corroborated these findings. Freshly isolated from a whole aortic leaflet, noncultured cells were gated for live cells, and only single cells were selected for analysis. We identified an αSMA-positive population (2.5% of cells), of which 80% of cells were double positive for apoJ and αSMA. Approximately, 3% of cells were positive for CD68 with 80% double positive for CD68 and apoD (Supporting Information 2 for all FACS analyses). Clinical evidence indicates that apoC-III may promote cardiovascular events independent of traditional proatherogenic lipoproteins and lipids such as LDL or triglycerides (17Sun J.T. Chen Y.Y. Mao J.Y. Wang Y.P. Chen Y.F. Hu X. Yang K. Liu Y. Oxidized HDL, as a novel biomarker for calcific aortic valve disease, promotes the calcification of aortic valve interstitial cells.J. Cardiovasc. Transl. Res. 2019; 12: 560-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). ApoC-III is currently under investigation in clinical trials as a therapeutic target for dyslipidemia (18Trapeaux J. Busseuil D. Shi Y. Nobari S. Shustik D. Mecteau M. El-Hamamsy I. Lebel M. Mongrain R. Rhéaume E. Tardif J.C. Improvement of aortic valve stenosis by ApoA-I mimetic therapy is associated with decreased aortic root and valve remodelling in mice.Br. J.

Med. 2008; 359: 1343-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). In light of these findings and our observations that apoC-III was significantly enriched in calcific CAVD tissue, highly present in the disease-prone fibrosa layer, and abundant around calcific nodules, we focused our investigation on whether apoC-III can promote AV calcification as an in vitro proof of concept of the observations we made with our proteomics and immunohistochemistry-generated apolipoprotein CAVD atlas. Immunofluorescence specifically identified apoC-III in fibrotic and calcific AV regions (Fig. 3C), corroborating our histopathology data (Fig. 2A). In addition, apoC-III was found in both lipid-rich and lipid-poor areas around calcific nodules of human AV leaflets (oil red O-positive and -negative, respectively; Fig. 3D), indicating that apoC-III may contribute to AV calcification, independent of its function in lipoprotein metabolism. In order to confirm that apoC-III protein alone can promote calcification, we incubated primary human VICs with human apoC-III and measured calcification at multiple time points using an established in vitro calcification assay (28Goto S. Rogers M.A. Blaser M.C. Higashi H. Lee L.H. Schlotter F. Body S.C. Aikawa M. Singh S.A. Aikawa E. Standardization of human calcific aortic valve disease in vitro modeling reveals passage-dependent calcification.Front. Cardiovasc. Med. 2019; 6: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Calcific burden was significantly elevated in comparison to non–apoC-III-incubated controls at both incubation time points, demonstrating apoC-III-driven induction of VIC calcification (Fig. 4, A–B) . Notably, apoA-I incubation did not increase calcification (Fig. 4, A–B), implying that this was a specific effect of apoC-III protein. To examine mechanisms by which apoC-III stimulates VIC calcification, we investigated the in vitro proteome of apoC-III-incubated VICs. Principal component analysis suggested a major impact of the media incubation on the VIC proteome based on a total of 2773 identified proteins (Fig. 5A and Table S2). After FDR filtering for proteins with a q-value ≤0.1 between our three media conditions, 1365 proteins remained (Fig. 5B). Of note, MS readily detected the exogenous apoC-III incubation (Fig. 5C). Superoxide dismutase 2, a protein involved in clearance of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, was one of the most prominently upregulated proteins after apoC-III incubation relative to normal media (NM) and procalcifying media (PM) and may signify mitochondrial dysfunction in apoC-III incubated VICs (Fig. 5D). Besides superoxide dismutase 2, apoC-III increased several mitochondrial and oxidative stress–related proteins (HSPA9, HSPD1, HTRA2, LON1, CLPP, and CLPX) and elements of inflammation cascades (TGFB1 and IL6ST) relative to both NM and PM (Fig. 5, E–F, respectively). We next investigated differentially enriched protein modules for enriched proteins after apoC-III incubation relative to NM and PM and detected a significant enrichment in mitochondrial, mitophagy, and reactive oxygen species–related pathways (Fig. 6, A–B, respectively; complete modules in Supporting Information 3; all significantly enriched pathways per media in Supporting Information 4, A–B). In addition, the identified apoC-III–related pathways had significant connections with previously defined inflammation (29Song J.-S. Wang R.-S. Leopold J.A. Loscalzo J. Network determinants of cardiovascular calcification and repositioned drug treatments.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 11087-11100Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), calcification (29Song J.-S. Wang R.-S. Leopold J.A. Loscalzo J. Network determinants of cardiovascular calcification and repositioned drug treatments.FASEB J. 2020; 34: 11087-11100Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and CAVD (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T. Rogers M.A. Sharma A. Seidman C.E. Loscalzo J. et al.Spatiotemporal multi-omics mapping generates a molecular atlas of the aortic valve and reveals networks driving disease.Circulation. 2018; 138: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) modules on the protein–protein interaction (PPI) and pathway levels (Supporting Information 5). Mitochondrial dysfunction and ensuing oxidative stress may elevate inflammation (4López-Armada M.J. Riveiro-Naveira R.R. Vaamonde-García C. Valcárcel-Ares M.N. Mitochondrial dysfunction and the inflammatory response.Mitochondrion. 2013; 13: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway was significantly enriched after apoC-III incubation. In agreement with identification of the IL-6 pathway by proteomics and pathway analysis, IL-6 gene expression was significantly elevated after apoC-III incubation (Fig. 6C). Inflammation-related pathways have been shown to potentiate VIC calcification (2Bouchareb R. Mahmut A. Nsaibia M.J. Boulanger M.C. Dahou A. Lepine J.L. Laflamme M.H. Hadji F. Couture C. Trahan S. Page S. Bosse Y. Pibarot P. Scipione C.A. Romagnuolo R. et al.Autotaxin derived from lipoprotein(a) and valve interstitial cells promotes inflammation and mineralization of the aortic valve.Circulation. 2015; 132: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); therefore, we assessed a possibility that apoC-III may drive calcification potential via inflammation-mediated bone morphogenic protein (BMP) expression. ApoC-III incubation increased BMP-2 expression in human VICs (Fig. 6D), supporting an involvement of a mitochondrial dysfunction/inflammation-mediated calcification pathway triggered by apoC-III in human VICs (Fig. 6E). In this study, we demonstrated the following in the CAVD: (1) apolipoproteins exhibit differential abundances across stages of disease pathogenesis through high-precision targeted proteomics; (2) apolipoprotein tissue localization reveals preferential diffuse deposition in acellular extracellular matrix of a subset of pathogenic apolipoproteins; (3) apoC-III promotes calcification in cultured primary human VICs; and (4) apoC-III induced a mitochondrial dysfunction/inflammation-mediated calcification pathway. We previously indicated the value of subsectioning AV leaflets for molecular profiling across disease progression (25Schlotter F. Halu A. Goto S. Blaser M.C. Body S.C. Lee L.H. Higashi H. DeLaughter D.M. Hutcheson J.D. Vyas P. Pham T. Rogers M.A. Sharma A. Seidman C.E. Loscalzo J. et al.Spatiotemporal multi-omics mapping generates a molecular atlas of the aortic valve and reveals networks driving disease.Circulation. 2018; 138: 377-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although harvested from calcified valves, the inhomogeneous disease progression allowed us to identify NF and NC portions as well as the CAVD spectrum of fibrotic and calcific tissues from the same donor (confirmed by histopathology), thereby reducing interdonor variability. We leveraged the power of this approach to explore the differential distribution of the apolipoproteome. In the present study, our use of quantitative targeted proteomics integrated with the spatial immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to illustrate the presence of a broad range of apolipoproteins present in CAVD tissues and tissue layers. Our findings further suggest the presence of numerous apolipoproteins in pathologically remodeled AV tissue that is not limited to the atherogenic lipoproteins Lp(a), LDL, and very low-density lipoprotein; as well as their major composites apo(a), apoB, and apoC-III, respectively. Differentially localized apolipoproteins in AV leaflets support growing evidence suggesting that a variety of apolipoproteins may play unique roles in disease initiation and progression, either through direct pathological interaction with cells and surrounding matrix or through their cargo function including their lipid-carrying properties. It is well established that damage to valvular endothelium serves as a first insult to enable infiltration and retention of blood-derived factors into the valvular interstitial space. Exposure of VICs to these factors subsequently drives disease development through cellular stress and pathologic differentiation. The role of apolipoproteins on these processes in VICs remains insufficiently elucidated. Our finding of an abundance of select apolipoproteins retained within the extracellular matrix and the paucity of foam-like macrophages in calcific AV tissue points toward the lack of a macrophage-driven apolipoprotein and lipid removal mechanism in CAVD. In addition, our data show that local transcription of the apolipoprotein genes fails to account for the large differences in apolipoprotein abundance, suggesting that plasma-derived apolipoprotein infiltration likely explains much of this pathological effect. In the light of the expanding body of literature on Lp(a) and CAVD, the absence of an association between apo(a) by targeted proteomics and disease severity in this study was unexpected but can be easily explained by methodology limitations. An apo(a)-specific peptide that we were able to detect (GTYSTTVTGR) is part of the apo(a) kringle domain replicates, which are present in highly variable numbers among individuals (23Cowell S.J. Newby D.E. Prescott R.J. Bloomfield P. Reid J. Northridge D.B. Boon N.A. A randomized trial of intensive lipid-lowering therapy in calcific aortic stenosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 2389-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), and may thus not be suitable for absolute PRM quantification. Although, trends within a given donor tissue would still be valid, interdonor comparisons are challenging. To date, no mass spectrum standard exists for apo(a), in large part because of the confounding features highlighted previously. It has also been suggested that Lp(a) accumulates at sites of wound healing secondary to its binding capacity to fibrin, thus accumulating at sites of minor injury in the very early stage of AV lesion initiation (30Nordestgaard B.G. Langsted A. How does elevated lipoprotein(a) cause aortic valve stenosis?.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2015; 66: 1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), thus impacting the quantification in our sectioning approach. To date, a limited number of apolipoproteins have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of CAVD, mostly apo(a) (31Tsimikas S. Fazio S. Ferdinand K.C. Ginsberg H.N. Koschinsky M.L.

We selected two commercially available purified human apolipoproteins, which associated with disease progression in our tissue proteomics data set and represent large structural components of the major lipoprotein classes of HDL and very low-density lipoprotein, respectively. In addition to demonstrating that apoC-III enhances VIC calcification in concentrations observed in patient plasma (4López-Armada M.J. Riveiro-Naveira R.R. Vaamonde-García C. Valcárcel-Ares M.N. Mitochondrial dysfunction and the inflammatory response.Mitochondrion. 2013; 13: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), we found that apoC-III likely mediates valvular calcification via a mitochondrial dysfunction–driven inflammatory mechanism including an IL-6/BMP-2 pathway, a signaling cascade previously demonstrated as a major promoter of VIC calcification (2Bouchareb R.

Moreover, network analysis revealed connections of the apoC-III–related pathways with previously identified inflammation (29Song J.-S. Wang R.-S. Leopold J.A. Loscalzo J.

Our results are in line with prior findings, suggesting that ApoC-III drives proinflammatory signaling cascades (32Kohan A.B. ApoC-III: a potent modulator of hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease.Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes Obes. 2015; 22: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Zheng C.

Our novel findings are also in agreement with epidemiological data of an association between circulating plasma apoC-III levels and AV sclerosis (10Gerber Y. Goldbourt U. Feinberg M.S. Segev S.

However, our data provide a novel mechanistic link of apoC-III with valvular calcification beyond an epidemiological association. ApoA-I served as a second commercially available purified human apolipoprotein that we investigated for effects on calcification. The absence of in vitro calcification induction is consistent with prior findings, where apoA-I had an inverse relationship to risk for AS incidence (12Zheng K.H. Arsenault B.J. Kaiser Y. Khaw K.-T.

Cells produce a large number of protein complexes that mediate virtually all biological functions. For example, recent proteome-wide surveys in metazoans have revealed ∼1,000 distinct multiprotein complexes, and this number is likely underestimated (Heusel et al., 2019Heusel M. Bludau I.

With ever more sensitive proteomic and electron microscopy (EM) techniques, the identification and structural characterization of protein complexes is rapidly accelerating, enabling analyses at high-throughput and in close to native conditions (Rudashevskaya et al., 2016Rudashevskaya E.L.

In sharp contrast, the biogenesis and the dynamics of the vast majority of protein complexes remain very poorly characterized, hampered by a lack of suitable high-throughput approaches. Classical in vitro reconstitution strategies, while highly successful in deciphering the function of protein complexes (Liu and Fletcher, 2009Liu A.P. Fletcher D.A. Biology under construction: in vitro reconstitution of cellular function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), are typically applicable only to a few proteins at a time. On the other hand, top-down genetic approaches, powerful in identifying the relevant molecular players (Novick et al., 1980Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Identification of 23 complementation groups required for post-translational events in the yeast secretory pathway.Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), do not discriminate direct effects from indirect consequences of the introduced changes. Moreover, even when combined, these strategies cannot easily address key questions such as assembly kinetics or the order of the structural maturation processes, making these important issues difficult to tackle. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is one of the most elaborate protein structures in eukaryotic cells. It consists of ∼500 to 1,000 nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins, NUPs) that amount all together to a mass of ∼50–100 MDa. Whereas the NPC’s structural organization has been successfully studied in recent years by genetic, biochemical, and high-resolution structural techniques (Lin and Hoelz, 2019Lin D.H. Hoelz A.

Progress is hindered by the NPC’s sheer size, its association with lipid membranes, and the central role it plays in gene expression. To characterize the native assembly process of multiprotein complexes, we introduce here a method, entitled kinetic analysis of incorporation rates in macromolecular assemblies (KARMA). In KARMA, the co-assembly of newly synthesized proteins into a final complex is analyzed akin to a metabolic process by observing metabolic labeling kinetics in affinity-isolated protein complexes. We applied KARMA to study the process of NPC biogenesis and evaluated co-assembly kinetics among 320 pairs of NUPs in actively growing yeast cells. Based on that, we mapped the native order and timing of NPC biogenesis. We find that NUPs initially form subcomplexes, which then assemble in a hierarchical way from the center to the periphery. Unexpectedly, individual NUPs progress through the NPC maturation process at drastically different rates, ranging from minutes to ∼1 h, and incorporate into NPCs by different mechanisms: some via dynamic exchange and others by transiting through time-consuming maturation stages. Our results uncover central principles of NPC biogenesis and demonstrate the general utility of metabolic labeling to characterize the dynamics of macromolecular complexes. Protein complex formation can be thought of as a metabolic process. It begins with the synthesis of new proteins from smaller blocks (amino acids) and proceeds via a chain of maturation intermediates that include folding and multi-subunit assembly steps, ultimately resulting in a mature complex (Figure 1A). In our approach to probe the maturation processes of multiprotein complexes (KARMA), one of the protein components of the target complex (the “bait”) is affinity tagged, and newly synthesized proteins are pulse-labeled in actively growing cells by stable isotope labeling using amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Ong et al., 2002Ong S.E. Blagoev B. Kratchmarova I. Kristensen D.B. Steen H. Pandey A. Mann M. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, SILAC, as a simple and accurate approach to expression proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2002; 1: 376-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4409) Google Scholar). The tagged protein is isolated by an affinity pull-down (AP) procedure at several post-labeling time points, enabling the detection of bound complex components (the “preys”) (Figure 1A). For each time point, the isolated complexes are assayed by data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (Gillet et al., 2012Gillet L.C. Navarro P. Tate S. Rost H. Selevsek N. Reiter L. Bonner R. Aebersold R.

The appearance of an isotopic label in prey proteins is inevitably delayed due to preceding structural maturation events (Figure 1A). To provide a quantitative framework that relates the labeling kinetics observed in KARMA to assembly events during the maturation process, we developed a simple kinetic state model (KSM) analogous to models used to analyze metabolic fluxes (Niedenführ et al., 2015Niedenführ S. Wiechert W. Nöh K. How to measure metabolic fluxes: a taxonomic guide for (13)C fluxomics.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2015; 34: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and incorporation of proteins into a bacterial ribosome (Chen et al., 2012Chen S.S. Sperling E. Silverman J.M. Davis J.H. Williamson J.R. Measuring the dynamics of E. coli ribosome biogenesis using pulse-labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry.Mol. Biosyst. 2012; 8: 3325-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our KSM describes the propagation of isotopically labeled amino acids throughout the maturation of a protein complex in a growing cell culture as they incorporate into a complex together with a prey protein and are carried along distinct maturation states (Figure 1). In the simplest scenario, the amino acids transition from a maturation state (S1), where the newly made prey protein folds or binds to other components, to the mature state (S2), which is reached when the prey co-assembles with the affinity bait, producing the final KARMA readout as analyzed by AP followed by mass spectrometry (Figures 1A, 1D, and 1E; STAR Methods, “Irreversible 2-step assembly”). Other contributing factors such as prey dynamic exchange, degradation, or amino acid turnover can be accounted for by introducing additional KSM states and fluxes (Figures 2F and S4; STAR Methods). In our simple KSM, the distribution between the two states determines the timing of prey labeling, where a higher fraction of protein present in the maturation state translates to slower labeling (Figures 1E, S4A, and S4B) (STAR Methods, “Irreversible 2-step assembly”). The same also holds true for proteins that can reversibly detach and dynamically exchange between complexes. The labeling kinetics of such proteins can be represented by adding reverse flux to the KSM and mimic stably bound proteins albeit with a smaller fraction in the maturation state (Figure 2F). By fitting KARMA readouts with the KSM for non-dynamic proteins, we can quantify the effective fraction of protein in the maturation state, which we refer to as EMP (effective maturation pool), taking values between 0 and 1. For stably bound proteins, the EMP would be an unbiased estimate of the real fraction of protein in the maturation state. For dynamic proteins with an off-rate of Koff, however, the EMP would underestimate the real fraction by a constant factor of (1+Koff/μ)−1, where μ is the cell culture growth rate (STAR Methods, “2-step assembly with reversibility”). When KARMA assays are performed with different structural components of a complex as affinity baits, we expect to observe a larger EMP whenever a bait is located further downstream of a given prey in an ordered maturation process (Figure 3A). Thus, by providing an estimate of the protein fraction in the maturation state, the EMP gives a relative measure for the length of the maturation process for a given prey protein with respect to different baits, where more downstream baits will give rise to higher EMPs (Figure 3A). Such kinetic readouts provide proximity measures for multiple bait-prey pairs in the maturation process and, therefore, can be used to delineate the order and timing of structural biogenesis events (Figure 5A). In budding yeast, the NPC has a mass of approximately 50 MDa and comprises a total of ∼500 proteins (Kim et al., 2018Kim S.J. Fernandez-Martinez J. Nudelman I. Shi Y. Zhang W. Raveh B. Herricks T. Slaughter B.D. Hogan J.A. Upla P. et al.Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2018; 555: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). It assembles from 34 distinct NUPs, which are present, with few exceptions, in multiples of eight owing to the 8-fold rotational symmetry of the NPC structure (Rajoo et al., 2018Rajoo S. Vallotton P.

Karius K. et al.In-cell architecture of the nuclear pore and snapshots of its turnover.Nature. 2020; 586: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The majority of NUPs are arranged into evolutionarily conserved, stable subcomplexes. They form the major NPC sub-structures: two outer rings and the inner ring complex (IRC), which is anchored to the membrane ring and connects to the cytoplasmic export platform, the central channel, and the nuclear basket (Figure 2A). To test the feasibility of KARMA for the analysis of NPC biogenesis, we initially monitored the labeling kinetics of Mlp1, a nuclear basket NUP and well-established affinity bait for the isolation of structurally intact NPCs (Kim et al., 2018Kim S.J. Fernandez-Martinez J. Nudelman I. Shi Y. Zhang W. Raveh B. Herricks T. Slaughter B.D. Hogan J.A. Upla P. et al.Integrative structure and functional anatomy of a nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2018; 555: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mlp1 was endogenously tagged with a tandem Z domain of staphylococcal protein A (ZZ tag) in haploid yeast cells deficient in lysine biosynthesis (Oeffinger et al., 2007Oeffinger M. Wei K.E. Rogers R. DeGrasse J.A. Chait B.T. Aitchison J.D. Rout M.P. Comprehensive analysis of diverse ribonucleoprotein complexes.Nat.

Biol. 2014; 1156: 81-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Newly produced proteins were pulse-labeled in a log-phase culture by quickly exchanging the light lysine synthetic medium with a medium containing 13C6 15N2 (heavy) lysine. Culture samples were collected both immediately before labeling onset and at 30 min intervals thereafter, followed by ZZ-tag APs and mass-spectrometric analysis (Figures 1B and S1A). We were able to consistently detect and quantify the labeling of 32 NUPs (i.e., all NUPs except for Nup42 and Pom33) across five time points along with more than 600 co-isolated yeast proteins (Figure S1B). NUP labeling was highly reproducible across three biological replicates (Figure S1C; Table S4; see Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability). NUPs were, on average, labeled more slowly than co-purified bulk proteins and strictly slower than the Mlp1 bait (Figure 2C; Table S4), consistent with them undergoing a maturation process. At the same time, we found that NUP labeling rates showed a high degree of variability. NUPs of the symmetrical core, membrane ring, and central channel were generally labeled at slower rates than the ones from the nuclear basket and cytoplasmic export platform. Although labeling rates within sub-structures were typically similar, there were striking exceptions. Within the membrane ring, Ndc1 was labeled with heavy lysine much faster than Pom34 and Pom152. Furthermore, Nup82 and Nup159 of the cytoplasmic export platform were labeled slower than the other components (Figure 2B; Table S4). Another notable case was Nup145N and Nup145C: these two proteins are produced by autoproteolytic cleavage of a single precursor polypeptide, directly bind to one another (Teixeira et al., 1997Teixeira M.T. Siniossoglou S. Podtelejnikov S. Bénichou J.C. Mann M. Dujon B. Hurt E. Fabre E.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33968-33976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and yet display significantly different labeling kinetics (Figure 2D; Table S4). Unlike NUPs, nuclear transport receptors (NTRs), which associate with the NPC in a highly dynamic manner, were all rapidly labeled at a rate similar to the Mlp1 bait (Figure 2B; Table S4). To test whether the diverse NUP labeling rates could arise from in vitro intermixing during the AP procedure, we analyzed the labeling kinetics of proteins after mixing cell extracts from unlabeled Mlp1-ZZ tagged cultures with wild-type cultures that were labeled with heavy lysine (Figure S1D). In contrast to the highly dynamic NTRs, NUPs displayed low intermixing (<10% labeling), demonstrating that post-lysis intermixing is not a major contributor to our KARMA readouts (Figure S1E; Table S4). Enhanced labeling kinetics could also be due to differences in protein turnover rates (STAR Methods, “Irreversible 2-step assembly with degradation”). Although earlier proteome-wide analyses had shown that NUPs and NTRs are stable proteins with very slow turnover (Christiano et al., 2014Christiano R. Nagaraj N. Fröhlich F. Walther T.C. Global proteome turnover analyses of the Yeasts S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), it was important to evaluate whether the diversity in labeling rates could be explained by this factor. To this end, we compared the labeling of NUPs, NTRs, and other abundant proteins co-purified in KARMA to the labeling in total cell lysates, which were the source for the respective APs. Parallel reaction monitoring (Peterson et al., 2012Peterson A.C. Russell J.D. Bailey D.J. Westphall M.S. Coon J.J. Parallel reaction monitoring for high resolution and high mass accuracy quantitative, targeted proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1475-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) allowed us to follow some of the proteins within each category at the latest post-labeling time point. The investigated proteins did not show prominent labeling differences in total lysates, while their labeling in KARMA was differentially delayed (Figure 2E; Table S4). We therefore conclude that total intracellular pools of these proteins are replenished at similar rates and that any labeling delay observed in KARMA can be confidently explained by the non-equal time it takes for different NUPs to assemble into a complex with Mlp1. The observed labeling differences are well explained by our KSM as a tug of war between two kinetic factors: (1) a labeling delay caused by maturation steps preceding the co-assembly with Mlp1 and (2) an accelerating effect caused by a protein’s dynamic exchange that effectively reduces the maturation pool size to various extents for different proteins (Figures 1E and 2F) (STAR Methods, “2-step assembly with reversibility”). The lack of a maturation state for the bait protein explains the similar labeling kinetics of Mlp1 in total cell lysates and APs (Figure 2E; Table S4). Furthermore, the exceptionally dynamic association of NTRs with the NPC, also observed in our intermixing assays (Figure S1E), effectively shrinks their EMPs to zero and leads to similar labeling kinetics in APs and total cell lysates (Figure 2E; Table S4). Consistent with this, the highly dynamic behavior previously reported for nuclear basket NUPs (Niño et al., 2016Niño C.A. Guet D. Gay A. Brutus S. Jourquin F. Mendiratta S. Salamero J. Géli V. Dargemont C. Posttranslational marks control architectural and functional plasticity of the nuclear pore complex basket.J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) can explain their faster labeling compared to NUPs from other sub-structures (Figure 2B). Having established that KARMA can detect differences in NUP maturation kinetics, we expanded our approach to use nine additional NUP baits representing all of the NPC sub-structures except for the membrane ring (Figures 2A and S2A). The Y complex was represented by Nup133, Nup84, and Nup85; the IRC by Nup188; the central channel by Nup57 and Nsp1; the cytoplasmic export platform by Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1; and the nuclear basket by Nup1 and Mlp1 (Figure 2A). A strain expressing a plain ZZ-tag under the control of the Mlp1 promoter (mock bait) was used to discriminate between specific and non-specific interactors in the APs. In total, we analyzed 120 samples across three post-labeling time points (30, 60, and 90 min), which allowed us to determine the labeling kinetics of all NUPs except Nup42 and Pom33 (Figure S2B) along with ∼900 other proteins. NUPs were highly enriched in the APs with all baits compared to the mock control (Figures S2E and S2F) and displayed highly reproducible labeling across biological replicates (Figures S2C; Table S4; see also Mendeley data in Data and Code Availability). As seen for Mlp1, newly synthesized prey NUPs accumulated heavy lysine slower than their cognate baits (Figure S2D). NUP labeling significantly varied depending on the bait, in a striking contrast to the NTRs and the majority of other co-purifying proteins (Figure S2B). For example, the majority of Y complex preys were labeled significantly faster when probed with the Y complex members Nup85, Nup84, and Nup133 compared to other NUP baits. Similarly, labeling of the cytoplasmic export platform Nup82, Nup159, and Nsp1 was faster when the bait was a member of the same subcomplex (Figure S2B). Nsp1 was labeled faster with the Nup57 bait, consistent with it being a part of the central channel complex (Nsp1-Nup57-Nup49) (Figure S2B). This indicates that NPC maturation is an overall ordered process and that KARMA can be used to examine this order and its kinetics. To better characterize the process of NPC biogenesis, we next quantified the duration of the maturation events for each NUP from the moment of biosynthesis to its assembly with each of the 10 baits. As a measure, we determined the EMPs by fitting the KARMA readouts with the KSM for non-dynamic proteins (Figure S5A) (STAR Methods, “KSM for each bait/prey based on labeling”). In our KSM parameterization, we used the median labeling values of three NTRs (Kap95, Kap123, and Mex67) as internal references. These three reference proteins have low protein turnover rates (Christiano et al., 2014Christiano R. Nagaraj N. Fröhlich F. Walther T.C.

Since the labeling of these proteins was not affected by NPC maturation, they could be used to specifically determine the contribution of the maturation process to the observed labeling kinetics of the preys. In our analysis, we also accounted for the turnover of the intracellular pool of lysine. During translation light lysine molecules that are available in the cell will compete with heavy lysine and thus globally “delay” the labeling of all new proteins including both preys and internal references.

To enable this stability, rodent neocortical pyramidal neurons actively maintain their mean firing rates within a target range, termed their firing rate set point (FRSP) (Dhawale et al., 2017Dhawale A.K.

Remarkably, while FRSPs of pyramidal neurons can span several orders of magnitude (Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014Buzsáki G. Mizuseki K. The log-dynamic brain: how skewed distributions affect network operations.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 264-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), individual neurons reliably return to their own specific FRSP following activity perturbations, indicating that these individual set points are actively maintained (Hengen et al., 2016Hengen K.B.

The factors that generate this broad distribution of FRSPs in vivo are poorly understood, so we developed an approach for permanently labeling pyramidal neurons according to their in vivo mean firing rates that permits subsequent ex vivo analysis of their synaptic and intrinsic properties. This broad distribution of mean FRs is a ubiquitous feature of cortical circuits that likely contributes to the information carrying capacity of these networks (Buzsáki and Mizuseki, 2014Buzsáki G.

Disruptions in the homeostatic regulation of network activity have been proposed to contribute to a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders (Ebert and Greenberg, 2013Ebert D.H.

High- and low-FR neurons in rodent frontal cortex and hippocampus are differentially modulated by sleep states, suggesting that they are functionally distinct and may play unique roles in information storage and transmission (Miyawaki and Diba, 2016Miyawaki H.

Turrigiano G.G. All for one but not one for all: Excitatory synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability are coregulated by CaMKIV, while inhibitory synaptic scaling is under independent control.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 6778-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The overall balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) has also been proposed to play an important role in differentiating high- from low-activity neurons (Yassin et al., 2010Yassin L. Benedetti B.L. Jouhanneau J.-S. Wen J.A. Poulet J.F.A. Barth A.L. An Embedded Subnetwork of Highly Active Neurons in the Neocortex.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and in the homeostatic stabilization of network activity (Keck et al., 2017Keck T.

Neurobiol. 2017; 43: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite this progress, it is currently unknown how intrinsic excitability, excitatory synaptic strength, and E/I balance contribute to the broad distribution of FRSPs seen even within single cell types in vivo, in part because of the difficulty of identifying individual neurons ex vivo after recording their activity in vivo. Targeted approaches for labeling individual neurons based on their in vivo responses are low throughput and prone to sampling bias (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N.

Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 65: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Reconstruction of serial sections following in vivo Ca2+ imaging is possible but requires unambiguous realignment of acute slices with in vivo images (Ko et al., 2011Ko H. Hofer S.B. Pichler B. Buchanan K.A. Sjöström P.J. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Functional specificity of local synaptic connections in neocortical networks.Nature. 2011; 473: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Labeling neurons based on immediate early gene (IEG) expression can identify active subsets of cells (Yassin et al., 2010Yassin L. Benedetti B.L. Jouhanneau J.-S. Wen J.A. Poulet J.F.A. Barth A.L. An Embedded Subnetwork of Highly Active Neurons in the Neocortex.Neuron. 2010; 68: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but the relationship between IEG expression and firing rate is not linear (Tyssowski and Gray, 2019Tyssowski K.M. Gray J.M. The neuronal stimulation-transcription coupling map.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2019; 59: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, to permanently label neurons in monocular visual cortex (V1m) of freely behaving mice in vivo based on their mean firing rate, we developed an approach that uses the permanent green-to-red Ca2+- and UV-dependent photoconversion of CaMPARI2 as a proxy for mean neuronal activity (Fosque et al., 2015Fosque B.F. Sun Y. Dana H. Yang C.-T. Ohyama T. Tadross M.R. Patel R. Zlatic M. Kim D.S. Ahrens M.B. et al.Neural circuits.

All-optical functional synaptic connectivity mapping in acute brain slices using the calcium integrator CaMPARI.J. Physiol. 2016; 595: 1465-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Following a paradigm that transiently increases neuronal activity, we found a correlation between cFos expression and in vivo CaMPARI2 photoconversion. The red/green ratio of individual neurons was lognormally distributed, similar to the distribution of firing rates. Neurons with greater in vivo photoconversion had higher firing rates ex vivo, and during ex vivo photoconversion, neurons with higher firing rates underwent a greater change in CaMPARI2 red/green ratio. Prolonged monocular deprivation (MD), a manipulation known to first induce a drop and then a restoration of ensemble firing rates (Hengen et al., 2016Hengen K.B. Torrado Pacheco A. McGregor J.N. Van Hooser S.D. Turrigiano G.G. Neuronal Firing Rate Homeostasis Is Inhibited by Sleep and Promoted by Wake.Cell. 2016; 165: 180-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), caused first a decrease and then a restoration in ensemble CaMPARI2 red/green ratios. Taken together, these data indicate that CaMPARI2 labeling is sensitive enough to detect differences in mean firing rates, and thus to differentiate between neurons with low and high FRSPs. We went on to characterize the properties that differentiate high- from low-FR neurons and found that high-activity layer 4 (L4) pyramidal neurons had greater intrinsic excitability and received stronger inputs from other L4 pyramidal neurons, although there were no consistent differences in total E/I ratio between these neurons. These data demonstrate that CaMPARI2 can be used to permanently label cells based on their in vivo mean firing rates and suggest that intrinsic excitability and intralaminar excitatory synaptic strength are important contributors to the broad range of FRSPs observed within single cell types in vivo. The Ca2+ dependence, titratability, and irreversibility of CaMPARI2 photoconversion makes it an attractive candidate for activity-dependent labeling of neurons in freely behaving animals in vivo. While CaMPARI2 has previously been used to identify neurons that transiently respond to specific sensory stimuli (Moeyaert et al., 2018Moeyaert B. Holt G. Madangopal R. Perez-Alvarez A. Fearey B.C. Trojanowski N.F. Ledderose J. Zolnik T.A. Das A. Patel D. et al.Improved methods for marking active neuron populations.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), its usefulness as a permanent marker of average activity in vivo over longer time windows (~30 min) has not been assessed. To this end, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses CaMPARI2 into the monocular portion of primary visual cortex (V1m) of mice at postnatal day 15 (P15) and 1 week later implanted a fiberoptic probe in the same craniotomy hole used for virus injection. One to 2 weeks after cannula implantation, freely behaving mice were subjected to in vivo photoconversion. We found that, with low UV light power (~0.20 mW), 30 min of UV illumination was sufficient to cause robust photoconversion. Due to the light-scattering properties of brain tissue, light intensity attenuates with increasing distance from the source, especially at shorter wavelengths (Al-Juboori et al., 2013Al-Juboori S.I. Dondzillo A. Stubblefield E.A. Felsen G. Lei T.C. Klug A. Light Scattering Properties Vary across Different Regions of the Adult Mouse Brain.Plos One. 2013; 8: e676269Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We found that the average red/green CaMPARI2 photoconversion ratio was quite constant within approximately 200 μm of the center of the exposed section of the fiberoptic probe (Figures 1A and S1), so all subsequent experiments were performed on neurons within this distance. To further control for differences in light intensity, all recordings following in vivo photoconversion were performed from pairs of nearby neurons, and statistical comparisons were made within these pairs. To verify that neurons with a higher red/green CaMPARI2 ratio after in vivo photoconversion represent neurons with greater average activity, we wanted to compare this ratio to an established in vivo marker of neuronal activity. Labeling with IEGs such as cFos is a common approach for identifying neurons that have recently undergone activity-dependent gene transcription (Barth et al., 2004Barth A.L. Gerkin R.C. Dean K.L.

Activity-Regulated Transcription: Bridging the Gap between Neural Activity and Behavior.Neuron. 2018; 100: 330-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), although the precise relationship between neuronal activity and cFos expression is often nonlinear (Tyssowski and Gray, 2019Tyssowski K.M. Gray J.M. The neuronal stimulation-transcription coupling map.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2019; 59: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Recent work in rodent V1 revealed that 60 h of dark exposure followed by 1 h of light re-exposure drives an elevation in firing and robust expression of cFos (Torrado Pacheco et al., 2019Torrado Pacheco A. Tilden E.I. Grutzner S.M. Lane B.J. Wu Y. Hengen K.B. Gjorgjieva J. Turrigiano G.G. Rapid and active stabilization of visual cortical firing rates across light-dark transitions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 18068-18077Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we subjected mice to this protocol while photoconverting CaMPARI2 during the first 30 min of light re-exposure, when firing is elevated (Torrado Pacheco et al., 2019Torrado Pacheco A. Tilden E.I. Grutzner S.M. Lane B.J. Wu Y. Hengen K.B. Gjorgjieva J. Turrigiano G.G. Rapid and active stabilization of visual cortical firing rates across light-dark transitions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 18068-18077Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In mice housed on a normal 12/12 light/dark cycle, we saw only a weak correlation between cFos protein levels and CaMPARI2 photoconversion (r = 0.23, Figure 1B), but after light re-exposure the correlation between these two activity markers was robust (r = 0.65, Figures 1C and 1D). Our primary motivation for using CaMPARI2 to label neurons based on their in vivo activity was to be able to subsequently interrogate electrophysiological differences between high- and low-activity neurons. Therefore, it was essential to determine whether neurons with different firing rates in vivo retained these properties in acute slices. To this end, we photoconverted CaMPARI2 in vivo as above and then prepared acute slices from V1m and obtained cell-attached recordings from pyramidal neurons across all layers in active artifical cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (Maffei et al., 2004Maffei A. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G. Selective reconfiguration of layer 4 visual cortical circuitry by visual deprivation.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1353-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) to measure spontaneous firing rates (Figures 2A–2C). We found that the distribution of firing rates ex vivo was lognormal and very similar to the distribution observed from chronic in vivo recordings that spanned all layers (Figure 2D, data from Hengen et al., 2016Hengen K.B. Torrado Pacheco A. McGregor J.N. Van Hooser S.D. Turrigiano G.G. Neuronal Firing Rate Homeostasis Is Inhibited by Sleep and Promoted by Wake.Cell. 2016; 165: 180-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar were used to generate the in vivo plot). The distribution of red/green ratios was also lognormal, though over a narrower range than the firing rate distribution (Figure 2E). To verify that neurons with high in vivo photoconversion have higher firing rates ex vivo than low photoconversion neurons, we recorded from pairs of nearby neurons with different red/green ratios; in almost all cases, the higher red/green ratio neuron (indicating greater in vivo activity) had a higher ex vivo firing rate (Figures 2F and S2A). Conversely, when neurons within each pair were sorted by ex vivo firing rate, higher firing rate neurons had a higher red/green ratio (Figures S2B and S2C). Further, the magnitude of differences in firing rate and red/green ratio within each pair were positively correlated (Figure 2G). Thus, many of the factors that cause a neuron to have a high or low firing rate in vivo are preserved in the active acute slice preparation. We next sought to directly confirm that CaMPARI2 photoconversion rate is well correlated with firing rate. To test this, we devised an ex vivo photoconversion protocol in active acute slices (Figures 3A and 3B ; see STAR methods for details). This approach has the advantage that illumination is uniform in the X-Y plane, so we are not limited to comparing pairs of nearby neurons and thus can directly compare several neurons from a given slice. As above, we used cell-attached recordings to record the spontaneous firing of individual or pairs of neurons during photoconversion and measured the red/green ratio of these neurons every 5 min. We found that over a 30-min period, the number of action potentials was well correlated with the change in red/green ratio (Figure 3C), demonstrating that CaMPARI2 red/green ratio can be used to differentiate neurons based on their mean activity over the long timescales needed to estimate mean firing rate. To determine if differences in CaMPARI2 expression levels influence neuronal firing rates (through calcium buffering or other mechanisms) or photoconversion ratios, we examined the relationship between total CaMPARI2 fluorescence and spontaneous firing or photoconversion. We found no correlation between CaMPARI2 expression and firing rate (Figure S2D) or between CaMPARI2 expression and photoconversion (Figures S2E and S3A). Notably, Fano factor, a measurement of variability in spike timing and therefore “burstiness” (Eden and Kramer, 2010Eden U.T. Kramer M.A. Drawing inferences from Fano factor calculations.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 190: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. The variable discharge of cortical neurons: implications for connectivity, computation, and information coding.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3870-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not correlated with the change in red/green ratio, suggesting that the pattern of firing is a less important for photoconversion than the number of spikes (Figure S3B). Thirty minutes of UV exposure at levels sufficient for photoconversion did not influence mean spontaneous neuronal activity rates (Figure S3C), suggesting this paradigm does not cause significant photodamage. As a final confirmation that greater photoconversion is correlated with higher firing rates, we compared the activity of pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons during ex vivo photoconversion for 10 min. In each case, the neuron with a higher red/green ratio was the one with a greater mean firing rate in the previous 10 min (Figure 3D). The converse was true as well, as neurons with a greater mean firing rate always had a higher red/green ratio (Figure S3D). As with the 30-min photoconversion experiments described above, we found that neurons with high and low red/green ratios did not have different Fano factors (Figure 3E), and that mean firing rate was not significantly affected by CaMPARI2 expression levels (Figure S3E). Together, these data demonstrate that CaMPARI2 red/green ratio can be used to reliably differentiate neurons with different mean activity levels. It is well established that brief (3 day) monocular deprivation (MD) via monocular lid suture during the classic visual system critical period (roughly postnatal days 21–33) induces a drop in activity in the monocular portion of primary visual cortex relative to the unmanipulated hemisphere (Gordon and Stryker, 1996Gordon J.A.

To determine whether CaMPARI2 is sensitive enough to detect this drop and restoration of activity, we labeled L4 pyramidal neurons using a Cre-dependent pan-neuronal CaMPARI2 virus in Scnn1a-Cre mice, in which Cre expression is restricted to L4 excitatory neurons (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L.

We chose to restrict this analysis to L4 pyramidal neurons because they are considered a single transcriptional cell type (Tasic et al., 2018Tasic B. Yao Z. Graybuck L.T. Smith K.A. Nguyen T.N.

Following 3 or 6 days of MD, we used our ex vivo photoconversion paradigm to permanently label neurons from both hemispheres of monocular V1 based on their activity and then quantified the red/green ratio (Figure 4A); we normalized the red/green ratio to the total fluorescence for each cell to minimize any effect of different expression levels between hemispheres. With this approach, we were able to sample a large number of identified neurons (>480) in each condition. After 3 days of MD, there was a significant reduction in the red/green ratio in the deprived population relative to the control population (Figures 4B and 4C). The magnitude of the drop (median deprived value was 72% of control) was similar"

The high gravitational fields should cause heavy elements to rapidly sink below the white dwarf surface. Nevertheless some “polluted” white dwarfs have evidence for those materials on their surface, which is thought to be due to the recent accretion of rocky bodies from a surrounding planetary system. Kaiser et al. report a white dwarf with pollution by potassium and lithium. This observation provides a record of the composition of the accreted rocky bodies and of the Galactic lithium abundance when the planetary system formed, billions of years ago.

https://openalex.org/W3110855371,"Once internalized, receptors reach the sorting endosome and are either targeted for degradation or recycled to the plasma membrane, a process mediated at least in part by tubular recycling endosomes (TREs). TREs may be efficient for sorting owing to the ratio of large surface membrane area to luminal volume; following receptor segregation, TRE fission likely releases receptor-laden tubules and vesicles for recycling. Despite the importance of TRE networks for recycling, these unique structures remain poorly understood, and unresolved questions relate to their lipid and protein composition and biogenesis. Our previous studies have depicted the endocytic protein MICAL-L1 as an essential TRE constituent, and newer studies show a similar localization for the GTP-binding protein Rab10. We demonstrate that TREs are enriched in both phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), supporting the idea of MICAL-L1 recruitment by PA and Rab10 recruitment via PI(4,5)P2. Using siRNA knock-down, we demonstrate that Rab10-marked TREs remain prominent in cells upon MICAL-L1 or Syndapin2 depletion. However, depletion of Rab10 or its interaction partner, EHBP1, led to loss of MICAL-L1-marked TREs. We next used phospholipase D inhibitors to decrease PA synthesis, acutely disrupt TREs, and enable monitoring of TRE regeneration after inhibitor washout. Rab10 depletion prevented TRE regeneration, whereas MICAL-L1 knock-down did not. It is surprising that EHBP1 depletion did not affect TRE regeneration under these conditions. Overall, our study supports a primary role for Rab10 and the requirement for PA and PI(4,5)P2 in TRE biogenesis and regeneration, with Rab10 likely linking the sorting endosome to motor proteins and the microtubule network."
https://openalex.org/W3111424251,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator that exerts its activity via activation of five different G protein–coupled receptors, designated as S1P1–5. This potent lipid mediator is synthesized from the sphingosine precursor by two sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and 2) and must be exported to exert extracellular signaling functions. We recently identified Mfsd2b as the S1P transporter in the hematopoietic system. However, the sources of sphingosine for S1P synthesis and the transport mechanism of Mfsd2b in erythrocytes remain to be determined. Here, we show that erythrocytes efficiently take up exogenous sphingosine and that a de novo synthesis pathway in part provides sphingosines to erythrocytes. The uptake of sphingosine in erythrocytes is facilitated by the activity of SphK1. By converting sphingosine into S1P, SphK1 indirectly increases the influx of sphingosine, a process that is irreversible in erythrocytes. Our results explain for the abnormally high amount of sphingosine accumulation in Mfsd2b knockout erythrocytes. Furthermore, we show that Mfsd2b utilizes a proton gradient to facilitate the release of S1P. The negatively charged residues D95 and T157 are essential for Mfsd2b transport activity. Of interest, we also discovered an S1P analog that inhibits S1P export from erythrocytes, providing evidence that sphingosine analogs can be used to inhibit S1P export by Mfsd2b.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which is the phosphorylated product of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SphK1 and 2) enzymes, is an abundant lipid mediator secreted by several cell types. The lipid mediator exerts its signaling activity by activating five different G protein–coupled receptors (S1P1–5) expressed in various cell types. Depending on the specific receptor subtype, S1P stimulates a myriad of cellular functions including cell mobility, proliferation, death, and differentiation in both an autocrine and a paracrine fashion. It is now established that S1P is required to sustain endothelial cell integrity and functions by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins. This signaling pathway also protects endothelial cells from inflammation by antagonizing the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which are the adhesion molecules for leukocytes rolling and transverse of blood vessels (1Galvani S.

Targeting S1P signaling in lymphocytes has been utilized for treatment of multiple sclerosis (8Maceyka M. Harikumar K.B. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling and its role in disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2012; 22: 50-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Thus, the S1P signaling pathway holds great promises for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is a zwitterionic lipid. Thus, it must be transported by transport proteins to function as an extracellular signaling molecule. One of the major challenges in the S1P signaling field is the identification of S1P transporters. ATP-dependent transporters such as ABCC1 and ABCC5 were identified as potential S1P transporters (9Mitra P. Oskeritzian C.A. Payne S.G. Beaven M.A. Milstien S. Spiegel S.

The discovery of protein spinster homolog 2 (Spns2) as a first bona fide S1P transporter in the lymphatic system has partially explained for the sources of S1P (11Kawahara A. Nishi T. Hisano Y. Fukui H. Yamaguchi A. Mochizuki N. The sphingolipid transporter spns2 functions in migration of zebrafish myocardial precursors.Science. 2009; 323: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is understood that Spns2 exports S1P from lymphatic endothelial cells and that it contributes a minor amount of plasma S1P (6Fukuhara S. Simmons S. Kawamura S. Inoue A. Orba Y. Tokudome T.

Works from several groups have identified that erythrocytes contribute a large amount of plasma. However, the identification of this S1P transporter was only accomplished recently by our group. We show that Mfsd2b, which is highly expressed in erythrocytes and platelets, exports S1P (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N.

Nguyen L.N. The signalling roles of sphingosine-1-phosphate derived from red blood cells and platelets.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2018; 175: 3741-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mfsd2b contributes approximately 50% plasma S1P. As the major cell type in blood, Mfsd2b-dependent erythrocytes is believed to contribute a major part. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which erythrocytes assimilate sphingosines for S1P synthesis and release is not completely understood. Mfsd2b belongs to a group of solute carrier proteins termed Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters. It is a homologous protein to Mfsd2a, the lysophosphatidylcholine transporter (16Nguyen L.N. Ma D. Shui G. Wong P. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Zhang X. Wenk M.R. Goh E.L. Silver D.L. Mfsd2a is a transporter for the essential omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid.Nature. 2014; 509: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Most of MFS transporters such as glucose transporters (Glut1–5), monocarboxylate transporters (MCT transporter family) transport water-soluble substrates. A few MFS transporters such as Spns2, Mfsd2a, and Mfsd2b transport lipid molecules. These lipid transporters may utilize a different mechanism to move lipophilic ligands through their cavity. In addition, some of the MFS transporters utilize cations to drive the transport of ligands (17Yan N. Structural biology of the major facilitator superfamily transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the mechanisms by which erythrocytes generate and release the S1P via Mfsd2b. We found that erythrocytes efficiently take up sphingosine for S1P synthesis. The influx of sphingosine is regulated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1). Furthermore, a gradient of proton is necessary to enhance S1P release activity in erythrocytes. Finally, we discover an S1P analog that may function as a competitive inhibitor of Mfsd2b. Incubation of isolated erythrocytes with exogenous sphingosine led to intracellular synthesis of S1P, which is then released via Mfsd2b (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N. Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), indicating that exogenous sphingosines can be used for S1P synthesis. However, it is unclear whether in vivo erythrocytes also take up sphingosines for S1P synthesis. Thus, we intravenously injected with a bolus of radioactive [3-3H]-sphingosine solubilized in bovine serum albumin (BSA) into WT and global Mfsd2b knockout (KO) mice and measured [3-3H]-S1P in plasma and erythrocytes. We found that exogenous sphingosine is quickly taken up by both WT and KO erythrocytes and used for S1P synthesis (Fig. 1, A–B). After 10-min injection, plasma S1P levels in WT mice were significantly greater than that of KO mice (Fig. 1C). However, the plasma S1P level in WT was not increased over time, instead it was slightly decreased (Fig. 1C). In addition, the intracellular level of S1P in WT erythrocytes mice was also significantly decreased over time (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that a bolus injection of sphingosine was utilized by blood cells and that WT erythrocytes release S1P into the circulation that is quickly turned over, in line with a short half-life of S1P (18Venkataraman K. Lee Y.M. Michaud J. Thangada S. Ai Y. Bonkovsky H.L. Parikh N.S. Habrukowich C. Hla T. Vascular endothelium as a contributor of plasma sphingosine 1-phosphate.Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In comparison with WT mice, plasma S1P levels in KO mice remained constantly about 50% of WT S1P levels. In addition, KO erythrocytes accumulated with significantly higher levels of S1P (Fig. 1, C–D). These results indicate that erythrocytes efficiently assimilate exogenous sphingosine for S1P synthesis and release via Mfsd2b. Several proteins including Spns2 and ABC transporters have been shown to have S1P transport functions. We showed that erythrocytes do not express Spns2 (Fig. S1A), while Mfsd2b is present as previously shown (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A.

Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, we performed S1P transport assays using erythrocytes isolated from global Mfsd2b KO and Spns2 KO mice. Consistently with previous findings (13Mendoza A. Breart B. Ramos-Perez W.D. Pitt L.A. Gobert M. Sunkara M. Lafaille J.J. Morris A.J. Schwab S.R. The transporter Spns2 is required for secretion of lymph but not plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 1104-1110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), erythrocytes isolated from global Spns2 KO exhibit normal S1P transport activity that is comparable with that of WT cells, whereas Mfsd2b KO erythrocytes showed a significant reduction of S1P transport (Fig. S1, B–C). These findings indicate that Mfsd2b, but not Spns2, is the S1P transporter in erythrocytes, explaining the remarkably high level of S1P accumulation in KO erythrocytes as shown previously by our results (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N. Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Mfsd2b-expressing cells including erythrocytes and platelets contribute approximately 50% of the total S1P in plasma (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N. Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We generated erythrocyte-specific knockout of Mfsd2b (referred to as Mfsd2bf/fEpoR-Cre). Analysis of plasma S1P levels from Mfsd2bf/fEpoR-Cre, global Mfsd2b KO mice, and their respective controls showed that S1P levels in Mfsd2bf/fEpoR-Cre mice and global Mfsd2b KO mice had approximately 50% levels of control mice (Fig. 1E). Taken together, our results indicate that erythrocytes provide a major pool of plasma S1P via Mfsd2b. To gain more insight into how erythrocytes take up exogenous sphingosines, we utilized a fluorescent-labeled sphingosine (NBD-Sph) to observe its transport routes in red blood cells (RBCs). Upon incubation of NBD-Sph with WT or Mfsd2b KO RBC, we found that the majority of the fluorescent signals was localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). Of note, we also found several small NBD-labeled puncta present in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane of WT and Mfsd2b KO RBCs (Fig. 2A, arrows). There were a few puncta present in each erythrocyte, and the number of puncta was not significantly different between WT and KO erythrocytes (Fig. 2B). This phenotype was also observed with another sphingosine analog, TMR-Sph (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2). The nature of these NBD-labeled puncta is unclear, but they were negative for Ter119, a plasma membrane marker for RBC (Fig. S3), ruling out the involvement of endocytosis as a route for sphingosine transport in RBC. Deletion of SphK1 in erythrocytes caused an approximately twofold increase of sphingosine (19Xiong Y. Yang P. Proia R.L. Hla T. Erythrocyte-derived sphingosine 1-phosphate is essential for vascular development.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 4823-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of Mfsd2b resulted in an approximately tenfold increase of sphingosines in erythrocytes (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N. Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These data suggest that conversion of sphingosine into S1P facilitated by SphK1 is necessary to drive the influx of sphingosine in erythrocytes. Thus, we tested whether inhibition of SphK1 with PF543, a specific inhibitor for SphK1, could reduce the uptake of sphingosine (3Gazit S.L. Mariko B. Therond P. Decouture B. Xiong Y. Couty L. Bonnin P. Baudrie V. Le Gall S.M. Dizier B. Zoghdani N. Ransinan J. Hamilton J.R. Gaussem P.

Res. 2016; 119: e110-e126Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Indeed, PF543 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of extracellular and intracellular S1P in WT and Mfsd2b KO cells, indicating that PF543 inhibits S1P synthesis and reduces total S1P levels (Fig. 2, D–E). We found that inhibition of SphK1 with PF543 significantly reduced sphingosine uptake in both WT and Mfsd2b KO RBCs as there was a significantly higher amount of sphingosine present in the medium (Fig. 2F). Mfsd2b deletion did not affect sphingosine uptake (Fig. 2F). Together, our results indicate that phosphorylation of sphingosine by SphK1 facilitates its influx into erythrocytes. These results also indicate that Mfsd2b works downstream of SphK1 pathway. The range of plasma concentration of sphingosines including dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) and sphingosine is from 50 to 150 nM (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F.

Our results above suggest that sphingosine in plasma can be used by the SphK1-Mfsd2b axis in erythrocytes for S1P synthesis and release. To gain more insight into the source of sphingosines for S1P synthesis in vivo, we utilized myriocin, a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase, SPT1 (also known as Sptlc1) to inhibit de novo synthesis of sphingolipids. Wildtype and Mfsd2b KO mice were treated with myriocin for 24 days (21Hojjati M.R. Li Z. Zhou H. Tang S. Huan C. Ooi E. Lu S. Jiang X.C.

Chem. 2005; 280: 10284-10289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes and plasma samples were collected for S1P analysis. In erythrocytes, we found that the total S1P levels in Mfsd2b KO RBC were significantly reduced in myriocin-treated conditions, indicating that de novo synthesis of sphingolipids is involved in providing sphingosines for S1P synthesis (Fig. 3A). Myriocin directly inhibits the synthesis of dihydrosphingosine (dhSph), which is subsequently used for dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P d18:0). In addition, we found that myriocin treatment also decreased S1P (d18:1) and S1P (d18:2) levels in Mfsd2b KO RBC (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that de novo synthesis of sphingolipids is also indirectly involved in providing the precursors for the synthesis of these S1P species (22Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Sphingolipids and their metabolism in physiology and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 175-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Although S1P species levels were significantly decreased after myriocin treatment, Mfsd2b KO RBC still had a significantly higher level of S1P compared with WT cells, suggesting that other pathways may contribute to the sources of sphingosine (Fig. 3B). Thus, we examined whether a hydrolysis of endogenous sphingomyelin or de novo synthesis of sphingolipids in erythrocytes would provide additional sources of sphingosine for S1P synthesis. Treatment of washed RBC with amitriptyline or myriocin did not reduce the endogenous S1P level, indicating that hydrolysis of SM and de novo synthesis of sphingosines are not active in RBC (Fig. S4A). The sphingomyelinase activity from WT and Mfsd2b KO RBCs was not detectable, suggesting that the hydrolysis of sphingolipids is not active in RBC (Fig. S4B). Our data suggest, perhaps, myriocin treatment was incomplete. In plasma, we did not observe a significant decrease in the total level of S1P after myriocin treatment (Fig. 3C), with the exception that dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate was significantly reduced after myriocin treatment in WT mice (Fig. 3D). Together, these results indicate that de novo synthesis of the sphingolipid pathway, rather than endogenous sources, partially provides substrates for S1P generation in erythrocytes. In erythrocytes, Band3 (also called Slc4a1) is a highly abundant protein, which is critical to maintain membrane potential by exchanging anions. It is intriguing that, inhibition of Band3 has been reported to affect S1P release in erythrocytes (23Kurano M. Nishikawa M. Kuma H. Jona M. Yatomi Y. Involvement of Band3 in the efflux of sphingosine 1-phosphate from erythrocytes.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0177543Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, glyburide, an inhibitor of ATP-sensitive potassium channel and several proton pump inhibitors were shown to affect S1P release from erythrocytes (Fig. S5) (10Kobayashi N. Kobayashi N. Yamaguchi A. Nishi T. Characterization of the ATP-dependent sphingosine 1-phosphate transporter in rat erythrocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21192-21200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi N. Kawasaki-Nishi S. Otsuka M. Hisano Y. Yamaguchi A. Nishi T. MFSD2B is a sphingosine 1-phosphate transporter in erythroid cells.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These results suggest that S1P synthesis and release in erythrocytes are sensitive to changes in proton concentrations. To test whether Mfsd2b utilizes sodium to drive S1P transport, we replaced sodium with choline in the transport buffer. However, replacement of sodium with choline did not result in the reduction of S1P export in RBC (Fig. 4A), indicating that sodium gradient is not important to generate energy for S1P export. We also ruled out the requirements of other cations and anions for the S1P transport by Mfsd2b (Fig. 4A). Of interest, Mfsd2b activity was significantly more active at pH 6.4 than at physiological pH 7.4 and became less active at pH 8.5 (Fig. 4, B–C). These data implicate that a gradient of protons is necessary for the increased release of S1P. Proton ionophores cause leak of protons and disrupt the membrane potential. Treatment of WT and KO erythrocytes with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) significantly reduced S1P export at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4, D–E). We showed that CCCP reduced S1P transport activity facilitated by lower pH (Fig. 4F). However, CCCP did not completely abolish S1P release in WT cells (Fig. 4F). Collectively, our results strongly suggest that a gradient of proton is necessary to increase S1P export activity of Mfsd2b in erythrocytes. To gain more insight into the possible binding of proton to Mfsd2b residues, we investigated on the transport activity of D95 and T157 residues (Fig. 5A), which were predicted to be conserved residues for binding to sodium in Mfsd2a (25Quek D.Q. Nguyen L.N. Fan H. Silver D.L. Structural insights into the transport mechanism of the human sodium-dependent lysophosphatidylcholine transporter MFSD2A.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9383-9394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For D95 residue, its substitution with alanine (D95A) resulted in the reduction of transport activity (14Vu T.M. Ishizu A.N. Foo J.C. Toh X.R. Zhang F. Whee D.M. Torta F. Cazenave-Gassiot A. Matsumura T. Kim S. Toh S.E.S. Suda T. Silver D.L. Wenk M.R. Nguyen L.N. Mfsd2b is essential for the sphingosine-1-phosphate export in erythrocytes and platelets.Nature. 2017; 550: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, substitutions of D95 to lysine (D95K) and arginine (D95R) resulted in a significantly reduced transport activity without changing protein expression levels (Fig. 5, B–C). Of interest, the mutants D95S and D95Y exhibited strong transport activity without change in expression levels (Fig. 5, B–C). These results indicate that the carboxyl group from D95 is involved in the interaction with proton to maintain the transport activity of Mfsd2b (Fig. 5, B–C). Similarly, we also showed that a substitution of T157 with lysine (T157K), methionine (T157M), asparagine (T157N), or arginine (T157R) caused a significantly reduced transport activity in Mfsd2b (Fig. 5, D–E). The transport activity of T157S was comparable with that of the native protein, implying that the hydroxyl group from T157 is also important for Mfsd2b activity (Fig. 5, D–E). These results show that the residues D95 and T175 are likely involved in the interaction with proton and a gradient of proton is necessary to increase S1P export activity of Mfsd2b. Mfsd2b belongs to the MFS transporters, which transport ligands through conformational changes. The alternative switching of outward and inward conformations facilitates the release of ligands through their transport cavity (26Shi Y. Common folds and transport mechanisms of secondary active transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2013; 42: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Most of MFS transporters accept small molecules as ligands (17Yan N. Structural biology of the major facilitator superfamily transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the transport capability of Mfsd2b with sphingosine analogs, which are commercially available (Fig. 6). Except for fluorescein-sphingosine, we showed that NBD-sphingosine and TMR-sphingosine can be efficiently taken up by erythrocytes for synthesis of NBD-S1P and TMR-S1P, respectively (Fig. 6, A–F and Figs. S2 and S6). In agreement with published data (27Kobayashi N. Otsuka M. Yamaguchi A. Nishi T. Fluorescence-based rapid measurement of sphingosine-1-phosphate transport activity in erythrocytes.J. Lipid Res. 2016; 57: 2088-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), NBD-S1P can be released by WT erythrocytes, resulting in a lower level of intracellular NBD-S1P compared with Mfsd2b KO cells (Fig. 6, A–C). The results indicate that the NBD group can be transported through the Mfsd2b cavity. Unexpectedly, we found that release of TMR-S1P was not different between WT and KO RBCs, resulting in a simultaneous accumulation (Fig. 6, D–F). The uptake of TMR-Sph (and also NBD-Sph) was slightly reduced in Mfsd2b KO RBCs (Fig. 6F). These findings indicate that Mfsd2b is unable to export TMR-S1P. Given the structural similarity between S1P and TMR-S1P, and the inability to be expo"
https://openalex.org/W3112822276,"Elongin A (EloA) is an essential transcription factor that stimulates the rate of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription elongation in vitro. However, its role as a transcription factor in vivo has remained underexplored. Here we show that in mouse embryonic stem cells, EloA localizes to both thousands of Pol II transcribed genes with preference for transcription start site and promoter regions and a large number of active enhancers across the genome. EloA deletion results in accumulation of transcripts from a subset of enhancers and their adjacent genes. Notably, EloA does not substantially enhance the elongation rate of Pol II in vivo. We also show that EloA localizes to the nucleoli and associates with RNA polymerase I transcribed ribosomal RNA gene, Rn45s. EloA is a highly disordered protein, which we demonstrate forms phase-separated condensates in vitro, and truncation mutations in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) of EloA interfere with its targeting and localization to the nucleoli. We conclude that EloA broadly associates with transcribed regions, tunes RNA Pol II transcription levels via impacts on enhancer RNA synthesis, and interacts with the rRNA producing/processing machinery in the nucleolus. Our work opens new avenues for further investigation of the role of this functionally multifaceted transcription factor in enhancer and ribosomal RNA biology."

It is unclear how important plant-derived chelators, such as nicotianamine (NA), an organic small molecule that is ubiquitous in crops, vegetables, and various other foods, contribute to iron bioavailability in mammals. We performed electrophysiological assays with Xenopus laevis oocytes and radioactive tracer experiments with Caco-2 cells. The findings revealed that the proton-coupled amino acid transporter SLC36A1 (PAT1) transports iron in the form of NA-Fe (II) complex in vitro. Decreased expression of hPAT1 by RNA interference in Caco-2 cells reduced the uptake of NA-59Fe (II) complex. The uptake of inorganic 59Fe (II) was relatively unaffected. These results imply that PAT1 transports iron as a NA-Fe (II) complex. The rate of 59Fe absorption in the spleen, liver, and kidney was higher when mice were orally administered NA-59Fe (II) compared with free 59Fe (II). The profile of site-specific PAT1 expression in the mouse intestine coincided with those of NA and iron contents, which were the highest in the proximal jejunum.

Iron chelates hitch a ride on PAT1Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 296PreviewThe nicotianamine-iron chelate [NA-Fe2+], which is found in many plant-based foods, has been recently described as a new form of bioavailable iron in mice and chickens. How NA-Fe2+ is assimilated from the diet, however, remains unclear. The current investigation by Murata et al. has identified the proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (PAT1) as the main mechanism by which NA-Fe2+ is absorbed in the mammalian intestine. Discovery of this new form of dietary iron and elucidation of its pathway of intestinal absorption may lead to the development of improved iron supplementation approaches. Full-Text PDF Open Access Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms. This reflects its pivotal roles in diverse metabolic processes, including oxygen circulation, DNA synthesis, and the electron transport chain (1Kaplan J. Ward D.M. The essential nature of iron usage and regulation.Curr. Biol. 2013; 23: R642-R646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Iron deficiency is the most prevalent global nutritional disorder. For example, anemia affects roughly a third of the world’s population, and half of the cases involve iron deficiency. Children, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Thus, iron deficiency is a major global public health concern (2Lopez A. Cacoub P. Macdougall I.C. Peyrin-Biroulet L.

Intestinal iron absorption.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2012; 26: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Heme iron is abundant in meat and is more efficiently absorbed in the small intestine than nonheme iron. Heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1) is a transporter protein. It was first described as a transporter of heme iron (5Shayeghi M. Latunde-Dada G.O. Oakhill J.S. Laftah A.H. Takeuchi K. Halliday N. Khan Y. Warley A. McCann F.E. Hider R.C. Frazer D.M.

Thus, the processes and proteins functioning in heme iron absorption by mammals remain unclear. In addition to inorganic iron, nonheme iron is present in diverse forms in both plant and animal foods. The low pH of the stomach can stabilize iron in the reduced form of Fe (II) or ferrous ion. Dietary iron is typically the oxidized Fe(III) or ferric ion, which has low water solubility and poor bioavailability (4Fuqua B.K. Vulpe C.D. Anderson G.J. Intestinal iron absorption.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2012; 26: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The absorption of inorganic iron mainly occurs across polarized intestinal epithelial cells in the duodenum and proximal jejunum (4Fuqua B.K. Vulpe C.D. Anderson G.J. Intestinal iron absorption.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2012; 26: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Dietary Fe(III) is reduced by duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) (7McKie A.T. Barrow D. Latunde-Dada G.O. Rolfs A.

At that site, the absorbed iron is stored in the ferritin-bound form or is exported into the blood by the basolateral iron exporter SLC40A1 (ferroportin 1 [FPN1], iron-regulated transporter 1 [IREG1], or metal tolerance protein 1 [MTP1]) (10Kaplan J.

Nonheme iron uptake in the duodenum is mediated exclusively by the Dcytb/DMT1 route. However, Dcytb knockout mice reportedly lack a particular phenotype, such as a decrease in hemoglobin levels, body weight, or liver and spleen iron contents (13Gunshin H. Starr C.N. Direnzo C.

Cybrd1 (duodenal cytochrome b) is not necessary for dietary iron absorption in mice.Blood. 2005; 106: 2879-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that there must be a mechanism independent of Dcytb/DMT1 activity for dietary Fe (II) absorption. Candidate iron chelators that facilitate Fe (II) absorption include citrate, ascorbic acid, and other dietary factors. Humans ultimately depend on plants for their iron supply. Thus, the availability of plant iron is essential (14Welch R.M. The impact of mineral nutrients in food crops on global human health.Plant Soil. 2002; 247: 83-90Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nicotianamine (NA) is a hexadentate metal chelator ubiquitously present in higher plants. NA is essential for iron translocation in plants (15Takahashi M. Terada Y. Nakai I. Nakanishi H. Yoshimura E.

NA is a precursor of the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) (18Shojima S. Nishizawa N.K. Fushiya S. Nozoe S. Irifune T. Mori S.

Therefore, NA acts as an intracellular iron scavenger to protect cells from iron-mediated oxidative damage (20von Wirén N. Klair S. Bansal S. Briat J.-F. Khodr H. Shioiri T. Leigh R.A. Hider R.C.

These transporter proteins are members of the oligopeptide transporter family of proteins, some of which are involved in the transport of oligopeptide and amino acid derivatives (24Yen M.R. Tseng Y.,H. Saier M.H.

NA-Fe (II) is essential in plant iron homeostasis. Edible plants including beans and vegetables and plant-based juices contain abundant NA (26Yamaguchi H. Uchida R. Determination of nicotianamine in soy sauce and other plant-based foods by LC-MS/MS.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2012; 60: 10000-10006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). NA is also a potent enhancer of iron uptake by monolayer Caco-2 cells used as an intestinal model (27Eagling T. Wawer A.A. Shewry P.R. Zhao F.-J. Fairweather-Tait S.J. Iron bioavailability in two commercial cultivars of wheat: comparison between wholegrain and white flour and the effects of nicotianamine and 2′-deoxymugineic acid on iron uptake into Caco-2 cells.J.

However, the direct involvement of NA-Fe (II) complex in iron uptake in animals has yet to be experimentally proven. In addition, the mechanism of NA-Fe (II) complex uptake in the intestine is unknown. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of NA-mediated intestinal iron uptake, by identifying the NA-Fe (II) complex transporter in the intestine. The findings demonstrated that the SLC36A1 amino acid transporter (the human ortholog of proton-coupled amino acid transporter, hPAT1) (28Chen Z. Fei Y.-J. Anderson C.M.H. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S.

These results implicate NA as having a pivotal role in iron trafficking in the mammalian intestine. We measured the uptake rates of 100 μM NA-Fe(II) and free Fe(II) containing 1 to 2% 59Fe(II) by Caco-2 monolayer cells to assess iron translocation efficiency at pH 6.0, 7.4, and 8.0 (Fig. 1B). To minimize the effect of DMT1, which transports Fe(II) (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L. Hediger M.A. Cloning and characterization of a mammalian proton-coupled metal-ion transporter.Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2660) Google Scholar) independent of NA, the iron uptake assays were performed in the presence of excess NA (NA/Fe(II) = 10:1). NA-59Fe (II) uptake was pH-dependent in the order pH 6.0 > pH 7.4 > pH 8.0 (Fig. 1B). The findings indicated that Caco-2 cells take up NA-Fe (II) using the proton gradient across the plasma membrane. This result is similar to that reported for the plant YS1/YSL transporters, which mediate the membrane trafficking of NA-Fe(II) complexes (23Conte S.S. Walker E.L.

On the other hand, 59Fe efflux from the basal sides in NA-Fe (II) form was much higher than that in Fe (II) form, while the iron content within Caco-2 cells in NA-Fe (II) form was slightly lower than that in Fe (II) form, particularly at the substrate concentration of 500 μM (Fig. 1C). At each concentration, the total amounts of the intracellular and basal side 59Fe were comparable between NA-Fe (II) and Fe (II) (Fig. 1C). Previous studies revealed that DMT1 responsible for Fe(II) uptake by Caco2 cells negligibly transports iron in chelate forms (32Zhu L. Glahn R.P. Chi K.Y. Miller D.D. Iron uptake by Caco-2 cells from NaFeEDTA and FeSO4: effects of ascorbic acid, pH, and a Fe(II) chelating agent.J. Agric. Food Chem. 2006; 54: 7924-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We obtained the same result for NA-Fe (II), as described below. Thus, the result in Figure 1C indicates that Fe (II) in the NA-Fe (II) form is taken up by an unknown transporter other than DMT1. To confirm that NA and 59Fe were simultaneously taken up by Caco-2 cells, the cells were extracted 30 min after administration of NA-59Fe (II) and analyzed by cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Fig. S1). Both synthetic NA and NA-Fe (II) yielded single bands at an Rf value of approximately 0.7 following ninhydrin staining, which detects amino groups (Fig. S1A). 59Fe in the NA-59Fe (II) form and the free form were detected by autoradiography (Fig. S1B). The cell extract displayed a spot at the same Rf value (0.67) that agreed with that of authentic NA-59Fe(II) (Fig. S1, C–D). Since the free 59Fe remained at the origin on the TLC plate, the iron band visible at Rf 0.67 in the cell extract was thought to be the NA-59Fe(II) complex. To identify the transporter responsible for the uptake of the NA-Fe (II) complex in the small intestine, we examined hPAT1, because NA could be regarded as an amino acid derivative (Fig. 1A). PAT comprises four subtypes, PAT1–PAT4 (30Perland E. Fredriksson R. Classification systems of secondary active transporters.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2017; 38: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of human intestine and Caco-2 cells revealed that only the primer targeting hPAT1 yielded a product (28Chen Z. Fei Y.-J. Anderson C.M.H. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. Structure, function and immunolocalization of a proton-coupled amino acid transporter (hPAT1) in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2, A–B). Therefore, we focused on hPAT1 as the candidate transporter for NA or NA-Fe(II) in the human intestine as well as Caco-2 cells (28Chen Z. Fei Y.-J. Anderson C.M.H. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. Structure, function and immunolocalization of a proton-coupled amino acid transporter (hPAT1) in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We injected X. laevis oocytes with hPAT1 cRNA. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that hPAT1 was present on the plasma membranes of hPAT1-injected oocytes (Fig. 2, A and C) but not in control oocytes (Fig. 2, B and D). To show that hPAT1 was specifically localized in the plasma membrane, immunostaining was simultaneously performed using the plasma membrane marker Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA). Colocalization of hPAT1 and PMCA was observed (Fig. 2C). In control oocytes lacking hPAT1, only PMCA was detected, as expected (Fig. 2D). Electrophysiological assays next revealed that the hPAT1-expressing oocytes more effectively transported NA-Fe(II) (NA/Fe molar ratio =10:1) than NA or proline (33Broberg M.L. Holm R. Tønsberg H. Frølund S. Ewon K.B. Nielsen A.L. Brodin B. Jensen A. Kall M.A. Christensen K.V. Nielsen C.U. Function and expression of the proton-coupled amino acid transporter PAT1 along the rat gastrointestinal tract: implications for intestinal absorption of gaboxadol.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 167: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3). The oocytes expressing ZmYS1, which was first identified as an NA-Fe(II) transporter in corn (21Curie C. Panaviene Z. Loulergue C. Dellaporta S.L. Briat J.-F. Walker E.L. Maize yellow stripe1 encodes a membrane protein directly involved in Fe(III) uptake.Nature. 2001; 409: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), showed almost the same activity as those expressing hPAT1 upon addition of NA-Fe(II) (Fig. 3B). A concentration-dependent current was generated upon the addition of 0 to 200 μM NA-Fe (II) (Fig. 3C). Based on these results, we estimated Km of hPAT1 for the NA-Fe (II) complex to be 49.4 μM, which was significantly higher than that for proline. A Km of hPAT1 for proline of 1.7 mM was reported in Caco-2 cells transfected with hPAT1 (28Chen Z. Fei Y.-J. Anderson C.M.H. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. Structure, function and immunolocalization of a proton-coupled amino acid transporter (hPAT1) in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 mM and 5 mM of the PAT1-specific inhibitor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (34Metzner L. Kottra G. Neubert K. Daniel H. Brandsch M. Serotonin, L-tryptophan, and tryptamine are effective inhibitors of the amino acid transport system PAT1.FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1468-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), NA-Fe(II)-induced current was reduced to 62.1% and 30.1% of the original levels, respectively (Fig. 3D). NA and NA-Fe(II) transporter families in plants have been categorized as oligopeptide transporters, which are widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and fungi (24Yen M.R. Tseng Y.,H. Saier M.H. Maize yellow Stripe1, an iron-phytosiderophore uptake transporter, is a member of the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family.Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2881-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Lubkowitz M. The OPT family functions in long-distance peptide and metal transport in plants.Genet. Eng. (N. Y.). 2006; 27: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed human oligopeptide transporters using electrophysiological assays. Oocytes expressing the oligopeptide transporter hPEPT1 (SLC15A1) failed to transport either NA or NA-Fe(II), but were able to transport the positive control glycylsarcosine, which is a substrate for hPEPT1 (35Walker D. Thwaites D.T. Simmons N.L. Gilbert H.J. Hirst B.H. Substrate upregulation of the human small intestinal peptide transporter, hPepT1.J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig. S4A). As the next candidate, we examined the Fe (II) transporter hDMT1 (SLC11A2). It transported Fe (II) (100 μM) but not NA-Fe (II) (1 mM NA: 100 μM Fe), indicating that hDMT1 does not transport NA-Fe (II) as effectively as it transports Fe (II) (Fig. S4B). To further confirm the NA-Fe (II) transport activity of hPAT1, we knocked down hPAT1 in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference (RNAi). Caco-2 cells were transfected with three different RNAi sequences targeting nucleotides (463–483, 907–927, or 1608–1628) of the 5786-bp hPAT1 mRNA (28Chen Z. Fei Y.-J. Anderson C.M.H. Wake K.A. Miyauchi S. Huang W. Thwaites D.T. Ganapathy V. Structure, function and immunolocalization of a proton-coupled amino acid transporter (hPAT1) in the human intestinal cell line Caco-2.J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Among the three groups, only the cells transfected with the RNAi targeting nucleotides 463 to 483 of hPAT1 grew to form monolayers. The expression of hPAT1 was decreased to 55.0% of the level observed in control cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 4A). Immunoblotting for hPAT1 demonstrated that hPAT1 RNAi reduced hPAT1 protein levels by approximately 58% in Caco-2 cells relative to control cells (Fig. 4B). 59Fe(II)-NA uptake decreased to 18.3% in Caco-2 cells transfected with hPAT1 RNAi (Fig. 4C), while free 59Fe(II) uptake was not significantly affected (Fig. 4D). We carried out in vivo experiments using mice to assess the assimilation of iron in the presence of NA. To eliminate the effects of diet-derived NA, 7-week-old male mice were bred for 1 week on a synthetic AIN-93M diet that did not contain NA. After acclimatization followed by fasting for 16 h, Fe (II) or NA-Fe (II) and 59Fe were administered to 8-week-old mice. Blood, spleen, liver, kidney, and small intestine samples were collected after 0.5 h, 2 h, and 5 h for analyses (Fig. 5, A–B). In the small intestine, the 59Fe count was markedly higher than that detected in the other tissues (Fig. 5, A–B). There was no significant difference in 59Fe counts in the issues between Fe (II) and NA-Fe (II) administrations at 0.5 h and 2 h (Fig. 5, A and C). However, 5 h after administration, the kidney and spleen tissues of mice administered with NA-Fe(II) showed significantly higher 59Fe counts than those administered with Fe(II) (Fig. 5D). Results obtained in similar experiments performed in the same manner but without fasting were similar to the results obtained with fasting (Fig. S5). Hemoglobin (Hb) levels in the whole blood were also measured in parallel. NA-Fe (II) induced a slight increase in Hb concentration 5 h after administration. Fe (II) led to a small decrease in Hb concentration, which was caused by fasting (Fig. 5E). To gain further insight into the distribution of PAT1 expression in mice, we dissected small intestines into ten sections (sections 1–10 in Fig. 6A) (36Tamura A. Kitano Y. Hata M. Katsuno T. Moriwaki K. Sasaki H. Hayashi H. Suzuki Y. Noda T. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Megaintestine in claudin-15–deficient mice.Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and examined PAT1 and DMT1 (free Fe(II)-uptake transporter) gene expression in each section. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that PAT1 was abundantly expressed in the jejunum (sections 2–7) and was poorly expressed in the duodenum (Fig. 6B). DMT1 displayed the highest mRNA expression in the duodenum (section 1; a 3-cm fragment from the pylorus) (Fig. 6C). 59Fe isotope was measured in each section for the duodenum (section 1), proximal (sections 2–5), and distal jejunum (sections 6–7) 0.5 h after NA-59Fe (II) administration. The highest level of iron was noted in the proximal jejunum (section 3) (Fig. 6D). Free 59Fe uptake by DMT1 was dominant in the duodenum (section 1) (Fig. 6E). These findings agreed with the relative levels of PAT1 (Fig. 6B) but not those of DMT1 mRNA (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that the NA-Fe(II) complex is absorbed by PAT1 mainly in the proximal jejunum, while free Fe (II) absorption by DMT1 takes place at the duodenum (8Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.L.

A. 2002; 99: 12345-12350Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The detection of NA and NA-Fe (II) complex in the intestinal sections was performed by TLC. The compound that was evident as spots after the application of ninhydrin was extracted and identified as NA by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis after converting to a 9-fluorenylmethyloxy-carbonyl (FMOC) derivative (Fig. S6). TLC analyses of free 59Fe and NA-59Fe (II) detected by autoradiography revealed bands with an Rf value of 0 and 0.67, respectively (Fig. S7A). Extracts from the mouse upper small intestine (sections 1–6) collected 0.5 h after oral administration of NA-59Fe (II) also were analyzed by TLC. In the duodenum (section 1), a faint spot appeared at the origin corresponding to free 59Fe (Fig. S7B). Amounts of NA obtained from each section of the small intestine after NA-59Fe (II) administration were quantified using FMOC derivatization with LC-MS. The highest concentrations of NA were detected in the proximal jejunum, in sections 3 to 4 (Fig. 6F), consistent with the counts of 59Fe detected by autoradiography on TLC (Fig. S7B). The results of this study reveal that NA forms an NA-Fe (II) complex that enhances iron uptake by the proton-coupled amino acid transporter PAT1. The NA-induced iron uptake occurs in the apical membrane of Caco-2 cells and likely in the jejunum of the small intestine. Iron uptake by PAT1 has been reported to be greatest in the upper regions of the intestine including the duodenum and the proximal jejunum (4Fuqua B.K. Vulpe C.D. Anderson G.J. Intestinal iron absorption.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2012; 26: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we propose a new mechanism for"
https://openalex.org/W3113073522,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) were the first drugs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection, and their use can cause mitochondrial toxicity, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion in several cases. The first-generation NRTIs, including 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC), were originally and are still pursued as anticancer agents. NRTI-sensitive DNA polymerases localizing to mitochondria allow for the opportunity to poison proliferating cancer cell mtDNA replication as certain cancers rely heavily on mitochondrial functions. However, mtDNA replication is independent of the cell cycle creating a significant concern that toxicants such as ddC impair mtDNA maintenance in both proliferating and nonproliferating cells. To examine this possibility, we tested the utility of the HepaRG cell line to study ddC-induced toxicity in isogenic proliferating (undifferentiated) and nonproliferating (differentiated) cells. Following ddC exposures, we measured cell viability, mtDNA copy number, and mitochondrial bioenergetics utilizing trypan blue, Southern blotting, and extracellular flux analysis, respectively. After 13 days of 1 μM ddC exposure, proliferating and differentiated HepaRG harbored mtDNA levels of 0.9% and 17.9% compared with control cells, respectively. Cells exposed to 12 μM ddC contained even less mtDNA. By day 13, differentiated cell viability was maintained but declined for proliferating cells. Proliferating HepaRG bioenergetic parameters were severely impaired by day 8, with 1 and 12 μM ddC, whereas differentiated cells displayed defects of spare and maximal respiratory capacities (day 8) and proton-leak linked respiration (day 14) with 12 μM ddC.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are used to inhibit the reverse transcription of the single-stranded HIV RNA genome into double-stranded DNA. Reverse transcription is carried out by the HIV reverse transcriptase. NRTIs are typically used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs, such as nonnucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integrase strand transfer inhibitors, fusion inhibitors, and chemokine receptor (CCR5) antagonists in scheduled regimens called antiretroviral therapy (1Eggleton J.S. Nagalli S. Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). StatPearls, Treasure Island (FL)2020Google Scholar). One potent US Food and Drug Administration–approved NRTI is 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC), also known as zalcitabine. ddC has been documented to cause unexpected sensorineural deafness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, mitochondrial alterations, and reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (2Berger A.R. Arezzo J.C. Schaumburg H.H. Skowron G. Merigan T. Bozzette S. Richman D.

Invest. 2001; 81: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NtRTIs) are generated in vivo via phosphorylation of NRTIs by intracellular kinases (5Zhu C. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Incorporation of nucleoside analogs into nuclear or mitochondrial DNA is determined by the intracellular phosphorylation site.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26727-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or occur in a monophosphate bioisostere form (nucleoside phosphonate) such as in the case of tenofovir (PMPA). Nucleoside kinases such as DCK, CMPK1, and nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NME) act on NRTIs, such as ddC, and perform the first, second, and third phosphorylation steps, respectively, generating the metabolically active NtRTI ddCTP in the cytoplasm (6Liyanage S.U. Hurren R. Voisin V. Bridon G. Wang X. Xu C. MacLean N. Siriwardena T.P. Gronda M. Yehudai D. Sriskanthadevan S. Avizonis D. Shamas-Din A. Minden M.D. Bader G.D. et al.Leveraging increased cytoplasmic nucleoside kinase activity to target mtDNA and oxidative phosphorylation in AML.Blood. 2017; 129: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Once imported into mitochondria, NtRTIs can compete with native nucleotides for DNA polymerase active sites to inhibit mtDNA replication through chain termination. Unlike natural deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate substrates, most NtRTIs lack the 3′ hydroxyl group (3′-OH) and therefore cannot be extended by a polymerase once incorporated into DNA. As a derivative of deoxycytidine, ddC possesses a 3′ hydrogen in place of the deoxycytidine 3’-OH; thus, if ddCMP is not removed from the nascent mtDNA strand in vivo, replication will stall. Several DNA polymerases that localize to the mitochondrion, including the replicative mtDNA polymerase gamma (Polγ), are sensitive to inhibition by ddCTP. Anti-HIV NtRTIs including ddCTP, AZT-TP (3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate), 3TC-TP (2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine triphosphate), D4T-TP (2′,3′-didehydro-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate), and carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP) have been demonstrated to inhibit the nucleotide insertion activity of an exonuclease deficient version of the Polγ p140 catalytic subunit in vitro. Furthermore, when a WT version of p140 was separately incubated with DNA substrates containing different 3′-terminal analogs (ddCMP, AZT-MP, 3TC-MP, D4T-MP, or CBV-MP) their exonucleolytic removals were compromised in comparison with control substrates (7Lim S.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23616-23623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Polγ holoenzyme was demonstrated to remove 3′-end ddCMP, AZT-MP, 3TC-MP, D4T-MP, or CBV-MP from separate primer–template complexes slower than from a control substrate complex harboring a correctly paired dCMP (8Hanes J.W.

In contrast, the nuclear DNA (nDNA) polymerases alpha (α), delta (δ), and epsilon (ε) harbor strong nucleotide selection mechanisms and are less likely to incorporate NtRTIs (3Young M.J.

Primary human hepatocytes isolated from liver and liver-derived immortalized cell lines are widely used as models for toxicological studies as the liver is the primary source of drug metabolism and biotransformation (23Soldatow V.Y.

Dispos. 2006; 34: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Previously, we utilized HepaRG to gain insight into both undifferentiated proliferating and quiescent differentiated cell metabolism when isogenic cells were exposed to acetaminophen (APAP) and the biguanide metformin (31Young C.K.J. Young M.J. Comparison of HepaRG cells following growth in proliferative and differentiated culture conditions reveals distinct bioenergetic profiles.Cell Cycle. 2019; 18: 476-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We showed that metformin offers protection against loss of APAP-induced cellular viability and prevents APAP-induced decreases in bioenergetics in differentiated but not proliferating-derived HepaRG. It could be distinguished that treatment with metformin alone reduced the mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiratory capacity, and basal respiration in proliferating-derived cells. In addition, we recently performed mtDNA next-generation sequencing and reported the HepaRG mtDNA sequence including its haplogroup branch H15a1 polymorphisms and levels of heteroplasmy (32Young M.J.

In comparison with the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence, HepaRG mtDNA contains 14 nucleotide variations including two heteroplasmic variants, the noncoding control region variant 315insC at 42%, and the novel G13633A ND5 gene substitution at 33% heteroplasmy. NRTI-sensitive DNA polymerases localizing to mitochondria afford a unique opportunity to poison proliferating cancer cell mitochondria as certain cancers have an increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and nDNA polymerases are less sensitive to NRTI inhibition (6Liyanage S.U.

Different cancer types undergo different bioenergetic alterations with some being more glycolytic and others being more oxidative (38Wallace D.C. Mitochondria and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). When treated with ddC, proliferating acute myeloid leukemia cells preferentially activated the analog and blocked mtDNA replication and OXPHOS in comparison with hematopoietic cells (6Liyanage S.U. Hurren R. Voisin V. Bridon G. Wang X. Xu C. MacLean N. Siriwardena T.P. Gronda M. Yehudai D. Sriskanthadevan S. Avizonis D. Shamas-Din A.

Also, ddC was proposed to be used for treating tumors with high levels of expression of DNA polymerase beta (Polβ) (39Louat T. Servant L. Rols M.P. Bieth A. Teissie J. Hoffmann J.S. Cazaux C. Antitumor activity of 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine nucleotide analog against tumors up-regulating DNA polymerase beta.Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 553-558PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combined use of AZT and ddI was shown to reduce tumor growth of human colorectal carcinoma HCT-116 cells in mice (40Aschacher T. Sampl S. Kaser L. Bernhard D. Spittler A. Holzmann K.

Furthermore, studying the effect of ddC on different cell types is necessary, as the bioenergetic consequence of ddC on quiescent differentiated cells has not been thoroughly investigated. Evaluation of the off-target effects of drugs on mitochondrial function using human cell lines is an important consideration for determining mitochondrial toxicity because the complex mitochondrial network harbors multiple copies of OXPHOS complexes and mtDNA that may cause a slow response to these agents. It must also be noted that HIV-infected patients have undergone chronic months-long treatments with ddC (2Berger A.R. Arezzo J.C. Schaumburg H.H. Skowron G. Merigan T. Bozzette S. Richman D. Soo W. 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC) toxic neuropathy: a study of 52 patients.Neurology. 1993; 43: 358-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain information about the mechanism of ddC mitochondrial toxicity, here we examine the effects of ddC exposure on proliferating and nonproliferating/differentiated HepaRG cell viability, mtDNA maintenance, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. As mammalian mtDNA replication is independent of the cell cycle we wanted to determine mtDNA levels in both proliferating and differentiated HepaRG cell phases (41Bogenhagen D. Clayton D.A.

DNA samples from both cell types were compared using Southern blotting and dual digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe hybridization to estimate mtDNA content. Proliferating HepaRG whole-cell extracted (WCE) DNA samples were prepared from cells obtained at 7 days post-seeding at 2 × 104 cells/cm2, and differentiated HepaRG DNA samples were prepared from cells harvested at 7 days post-differentiation, Figure 1A. The levels of mtDNA in each lane of the blot were detected with the mtDNA-specific probe and were normalized to nDNA levels detected with the 18S probe in the same lane, Figure 1B. Using this relative comparison method, differentiated HepaRG contains ∼2-fold more mtDNA compared with proliferating cells. Since differentiated cells are no longer undergoing cell division these cells likely maintain a higher level of mtDNA copy number that is necessary for mitochondrial bioenergetic functions. Next, we determined the number of mtDNA molecules in WCE DNA samples using Southern blotting and the mtDNA DIG-labeled probe. Three-po"

At present, histone marks are used to identify and define enhancers but do not consider the endogenous role of an enhancer in the context of native chromatin. We employed a combination of genomic editing, single cell analyses, and sequencing approaches to investigate a Nanog-associated cis-regulatory element, which has been reported by others to be either an alternative promoter or a super-enhancer. We first demonstrate both distance and orientation independence in native chromatin, eliminating the issues raised with plasmid-based approaches. We next demonstrate that the dominant super-enhancer modulates Nanog globally and operates by recruiting and/or initiating RNA Polymerase II. Our studies have important implications to how transcriptional enhancers are defined and how they regulate gene expression.

We next demonstrate that the dominant super-enhancer modulates Nanog globally and operates by recruiting and/or initiating RNA Polymerase II. Our studies have important implications to how transcriptional enhancers are defined and how they regulate gene expression. Gene expression is regulated by two types of genetic elements: Trans elements typically encode proteins such as transcription factors (TFs), which subsequently bind cis-regulatory elements (CREs) that must be on the same DNA molecule as the gene they regulate. Different types of CREs have historically been classified based upon their behavior in plasmid-based reporter assays (1Banerji J. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Expression of a β-globin gene is enhanced by remote SV40 DNA sequences.Cell. 1981; 27: 299-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 2Moreau P. Hen R. Wasylyk B. Everett R. Gaub M.P. Chambon P.

For almost 40 years it has been accepted that promoters are required to be in the correct orientation and immediately adjacent to the gene they regulate, whereas enhancers operate independent of both distance and orientation. The advent of enhancer-specific epigenetic signatures based on histone marks such as H3K27Ac or H3K4me1 permit genome-wide identification of enhancers, which then demonstrate enhancer activity in reporter assays (3Catarino R.R. Stark A. Assessing sufficiency and necessity of enhancer activities for gene expression and the mechanisms of transcription activation.Genes Dev. 2018; 32: 202-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Rickels R. Shilatifard A. Enhancer logic and mechanics in development and disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 28: 608-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, plasmid-based assays are limited for multiple reasons. First, they do not fully recapitulate native chromatin structure, and therefore represent a highly artificial system. Second, they typically are performed on smaller (<500 bp) DNA sequences rather than on the larger chromatin domains of many highly active enhancers. Third, they cannot precisely link a given enhancer sequence to the gene(s) they may regulate in vivo. As such, plasmid assays are far more effective at confirming DNA sequences with enhancer potential, rather than definitively identifying them as enhancers. The advent of sequencing-based chromosomal conformation capture techniques has allowed the measurement of genome-wide enhancer-gene interactions, potentially identifying enhancer:gene regulatory interactions (5Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Capturing chromosome conformation.Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar, 6Yu M. Ren B. The three-dimensional organization of mammalian genomes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33: 265-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Of interest, this approach demonstrates that many enhancers interact with multiple genes and vice versa but in isolation are insufficient to properly determine if an enhancer is required for gene(s) expression (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Blinka S. Rao S. Nanog expression in embryonic stem cells - an ideal model system to dissect enhancer function.BioEssays. 2017; 39: 1700086Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The classic approach to address this question is through genetics, namely, deleting a putative enhancer and measuring the mRNA levels of nearby genes, a method made highly feasible through genomic editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas9. One important point is that, although these approaches can identify which gene(s) are regulated by an enhancer, many of the mechanistic details of how the enhancer regulates transcription to modulate gene expression are not elucidated through solely this approach. Multiple models of enhancer-mediated gene expression exist within the literature. Early theories postulated that enhancers looped in to interact with promoters and recruited RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to the gene’s promoter (9Rippe K. von Hippel P.H. Langowski J. Action at a distance: DNA-looping and initiation of transcription.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 500-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). More recently, multiple mechanisms that focus on enhancers regulating transcriptional elongation have been proposed, including promoter-proximal pause release of RNAPII through various mechanisms (reviewed in Chen et al. 2018). It has also been proposed that enhancers modulate transcriptional bursting, or the periods of time during which transcription is active, which represents a combination of initiation and elongation (11Bartman C.R. Hsu S.C. Hsiung C.C.S. Raj A. Blobel G.A. Enhancer regulation of transcriptional bursting parameters revealed by forced chromatin looping.Mol.

New studies demonstrate that among enhancers there is a subclass of highly active enhancers called “super-enhancers” (SEs, (13Pulakanti K. Pinello L. Stelloh C. Blinka S. Allred J. Milanovich S.

Dall’Agnese A. Boija A. Klein I.A. Coffey E.L. Shrinivas K. Abraham B.J. Hannett N.M. Zamudio A.V. Manteiga J.C. Li C.H. Guo Y.E. Day D.S. Schuijers J. Vasile E. et al.Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control.Science. 2018; 361eaar3958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note this current model remains to be definitively established. Collectively, this literature indicates that there may be multiple mechanisms by which enhancers regulate gene expression. The extended Nanog locus is a unique locus to study how super-enhancers regulate gene expression and pluripotency. The Nanog locus (150 kb) contains a number of different pluripotency-associated genes including Dppa3, Gdf3, and Apobec1 (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Levasseur D.N.

Oct4 dependence of chromatin structure within the extended Nanog locus in ES cells.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It also contains three SEs (−5, −45, and +60, based upon distance in kilobases from Nanog TSS) that interact with Nanog and behave as enhancers in reporter assays (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recent work from our group and others has demonstrated that these three enhancers are super-enhancers based upon several criteria, including high levels of the epigenetic mark H3K27Ac, robust binding by the Mediator complex, and production of enhancer-transcribed RNAs (13Pulakanti K. Pinello L. Stelloh C. Blinka S. Allred J. Milanovich S. Kiblawi S. Peterson J. Wang A. Yuan G.C. Rao S.

Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). One group has argued that the −5 SE/CRE is actually an alternative promoter, emphasizing that plasmid-based approaches are insufficient to determine if a DNA element is a promoter or enhancer (17Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N. Alternative splicing produces nanog protein variants with different capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42690-42703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that the −5 CRE is an enhancer by confirming that it operates in a distance- and orientation-independent fashion through genomic approaches and regulates Nanog by modulating RNAPII initiation or recruitment. Previously, we demonstrated that the −5 CRE physically interacts with the Nanog promoter by chromosomal conformation capture and could also activate Nanog expression in plasmid-based reporter assays (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Monoallelic deletion of the −5 CRE causes a 50% reduction in Nanog expression (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to recover mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that exhibited biallelic deletion of the −5 CRE, leading us to hypothesize it is required for pluripotency. We refer to this element as a CRE rather than an SE because one group has previously reported that this element is an alternative promoter (17Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N. Alternative splicing produces nanog protein variants with different capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42690-42703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify if this element is required for Nanog expression, we used genomic editing to insert a tamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible Cre-recombinase (CreERT2) into the constitutively expressed Rosa26 locus in ESCs to facilitate conditional deletions and then biallelically inserted loxP sites to flank a 2.5-kb region of the −5 CRE to encompass two Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 (NOS) binding sites (Fig. S1A, Fig 1A, left). Insertion of loxP sites causes no change to Nanog expression (Fig. S1, B–C). Treatment with 4OHT induces complete biallelic deletion of the −5 CRE as compared with vehicle treated (ethanol; Fig. S1D, Fig. 1A, left). ESCs began to differentiate and became nonadherent, consistent with a loss of pluripotency, following 4OHT exposure. Staining for the pluripotency marker alkaline phosphatase was reduced in bulk cells treated with 6 days of 4OHT (Fig. S1E i–ii) compared with control (Fig. S1E iii–iv). Deletion of the −5 CRE resulted in a rapid loss of Nanog mRNA (Fig. 1A, right) and protein (Fig. S1F). By contrast, Gdf3, a nearby gene, showed little change in expression following deletion of the −5 CRE (Fig. S1G). There was also a decrease in other pluripotency-associated TFs such as Oct4, Esrrb, and Klf4, demonstrating a progressive collapse of the transcriptional network regulating pluripotency (Fig. S1, H–J). Consistent with previous studies showing that Nanog represses endoderm specification, RT-qPCR for key differentiation genes (Fig. 1B) and endoderm-promoting TFs such as Gata4, Gata6, and Hnf4a (Fig. 1C) demonstrated an increased expression in specifically the endoderm-promoting genes following 4OHT treatment. These results demonstrate that the −5 CRE is required for ESC pluripotency, likely by regulating Nanog expression. Next, we hypothesized that the −5 CRE maintains pluripotency solely by regulating Nanog expression rather than the expression of another gene on chromosome 6 (chr6). To test this, we made a stable cell line expressing murine Nanog with a ubiquitous promoter (CAG; Fig. 1D, left). Of importance, Nanog+/− animals are viable and ESCs remain pluripotent (18Chambers I.

Endogenous Nanog gene expression can be followed with RT-qPCR primers amplifying the Nanog 3’ UTR, which is absent from the mNanogV5 transgene. Prior to 4OHT treatment, bulk cells express Nanog mRNA levels approximately 50% higher than wildtype ESCs, which then falls following 4OHT treatment to 50% below wildtype (Fig. 1D, right). After 4OHT treatment, these cells show a profound (>90%) reduction in endogenous Nanog expression (Fig. 1D, right) and a small decrease in Oct4 levels but no other significant change in other core pluripotency TFs such as Esrrb or Klf4 (Fig. 1E). In addition, following 6 days of 4OHT treatment cells remain alkaline phosphatase positive (Fig. S2A), consistent with the Nanog transgene rescuing the loss of pluripotency seen following deletion of the −5 CRE (Fig. 1). Following 6 days of 4OHT treatment on the −5 CRE floxed cells expressing individual clones were selected, expanded, and analyzed (Fig. S2B). These cells remain pluripotent even after 6 days of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal (Fig. S2C, right) because of the constitutive expression of Nanog off the ubiquitous CAG promoter of the transgene. Western blot analysis of total Nanog in isolated individual clones shows a decrease in Nanog expression of approximately 50% upon stable deletion of the −5 CRE (Fig. S2D). These data demonstrate that the loss of pluripotency in cells without the Nanog transgene is attributable to the loss of Nanog expression. It should be noted that pluripotency was determined by a combination of gene expression (Fig. 1E and see RNA-Seq below), morphology, and alkaline phosphatase staining (Fig. S2, A and C), but we were unable to perform the most rigorous test of either teratoma formation or tetraploid complementation owing to the presence of the Nanog transgene in these cells, which prevents differentiation. To determine if the activity of other super-enhancers within the extended Nanog locus changed upon deletion of the −5 CRE, we measured enhancer-transcribed RNA levels, which are widely used as a measure of enhancer activity (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S.

In individually expanded clones of the −5 CRE deletion with Nanog in trans, we observed a global decrease in enhancer activity (Fig. S2E), which may be due to the presence of the exogenous Nanog transgene at a decreased level (50%). However, we cannot rule out that the decreased enhancer activity is a direct result of −5 CRE deletion. From here forward, all experiments using a biallelically deleted −5 CRE deletion were done using clonal cell line(s) that supply Nanog in trans to prevent a loss of pluripotency. To determine if the −5 CRE solely regulates Nanog we used RNA-Seq to identify other altered transcripts. We used the cell line described in Figure 1E, a stable line with the −5 CRE deleted that expresses exogenous mNanogV5 and compared it with the floxed −5 CRE expressing exogenous mNanogV5 cell line. First, we identified genes on chr6, which showed at least a 2-fold, statistically significant change (adj p-value < 0.05) between samples (Fig. 2A). As a control, we also compared our data with previously published RNA-Seq data where Nanog was depleted by RNAi (21Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. Wong K.Y. Sung K.W. Lee C.W.H. Zhao X.D. Chiu K.P. et al.The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). We further queried changes on chr5&7 to estimate gene expression changes secondary to trans effects from changes in Nanog protein levels. We observed that gene expression changes in the −5 CRE deleted line mimics the Nanog RNAi data, implying that all changes are due to alteration in the levels of Nanog protein operating in trans. On chr6, none of the altered genes were within 1 MB of Nanog except Dppa3. The observed increase in Dppa3 expression was expected, since it is directly repressed by Nanog protein binding to its promoter (7Blinka S. Reimer M.H. Pulakanti K. Rao S. Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the −5 CRE only regulates Nanog. To further clarify if loss of the −5 CRE affected the expression of other genes, in cis we queried expression changes of all genes within the Nanog topologically associated domain (TAD) as well as the two adjacent topologically associated domains (22Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar), irrespective of statistical significance or fold-change (Fig. 2B, Table S1). With the exception of Nanog and Dppa3, most genes showed minimal gene expression changes that were comparable with the Nanog RNAi data, implying this was due to reduced Nanog protein operating in trans. We therefore conclude that the −5 CRE exclusively regulates Nanog expression in ESCs, with no evidence that it regulates other genes on chr6 in cis. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the Nanog −5 CRE is required for pluripotency through its direct regulation of Nanog expression. The Nanog −5 CRE in plasmid assays acts independent of distance and orientation and has been extensively referred to as an enhancer within the literature (23Kim J. Chu J. Shen X. Wang J. Orkin S.H. An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 24Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V.

By contrast, in at least one report the −5 CRE was considered an alternative promoter that played a critical role in regulating pluripotency through an alternative Nanog isoform (17Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N. Alternative splicing produces nanog protein variants with different capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42690-42703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given this ambiguity we chose to definitively establish if this element had enhancer activity within the context of normal chromatin with our 4OHT-inducible Cre-LoxP system by inserting one of the LoxP sites in the opposite orientation (Fig. 3A, left). In this configuration, Cre activation by 4OHT treatment will induce biallelic “flipping” of the −5 CRE continuously between the two orientations. Following treatment with 4OHT, individual clones were isolated and expanded and biallelic inversion of the −5 CRE was verified by PCR (Fig. S3A). On comparison of the biallelic inversion with the wild-type orientation of the −5 CRE, we observed no statistically significant changes in the expression of Nanog, Dppa3, Oct4, or Esrrb and only minor changes in Klf4 (Fig. 3A, right). To verify there was no change in the Nanog protein banding pattern to indicate a potential change in protein isoforms, we performed Western blots and did not observe any changes in the banding pattern (Fig. S3B). These data are consistent with the −5 CRE regulating Nanog expression in an orientation-independent manner, a classic property of an enhancer but not a promoter. Although we cannot rule out that this CRE can simultaneously act as both an enhancer and an alternative promoter, our data demonstrate that any alternative isoforms produced via the −5 CRE as a promoter (17Das S. Jena S. Levasseur D.N. Alternative splicing produces nanog protein variants with different capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42690-42703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are dispensable for pluripotency. We next hypothesized that the −5 CRE would also operate independent of distance from the Nanog transcriptional start site (TSS). To determine this, we first deleted the intervening ≈2 kb between the −5 CRE and promoter (Fig. S3C, Fig. 3B, left) and found no significant change in Nanog expression (Fig. 3B, right). Next, we biallelically inserted an additional copy of the −5 CRE between the Nanog transcriptional end site (TES) and the nearest CCCTC binding factor site to ensure it remained within the same insulated neighborhood (Fig. S3, D–E, Fig. 3C, left, 25Dowen J.M. Fan Z.P. Hnisz D. Ren G. Abraham B.J. Zhang L.N. Weintraub A.S. Schuijers J. Lee T.I. Zhao K. Young R.A. Control of cell identity genes occurs in insulated neighborhoods in mammalian chromosomes.Cell. 2014; 159: 374-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Insertion of the additional −5 CRE caused no change in Nanog mRNA levels (Fig. 3C, right). Treatment with 4OHT for 6 days resulted in deletion of the endogenous −5 CRE in bulk cells and caused a reduction in Nanog mRNA by approximately 50% (Fig. 3C, right). Expression of other key pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Esrrb, and Klf4 were unchanged, indicating that pluripotency was maintained (data not shown). The partial recapitulation of Nanog expression and pluripotency by the ectopic enhancers is consistent with the −5 CRE operating independent of distance, albeit less effectively than its native chromatin position (Fig. 3C, right). Nanog expression in the cells only containing the ectopic enhancer is ≈35% compared with wildtype, which is higher than the ≈10% Nanog seen on the conditional deletion of the −5 CRE in bulk cells (Fig. 1A) and near 0% Nanog we see on true complete deletion in individual clones (Fig. 1D, right). We do observe an insignificant decrease in Nanog in cells with ectopic and endogenous enhancers, treated with vehicle; however, this could be due to minor changes in chromatin architecture from the insertion of the ectopic enhancers. One reasonable explanation for the reduced Nanog expression with the ectopic enhancer is that the −5 CRE includes a larger chromatin domain, whereas we inserted only the core ≈2.5 kb containing two NOS sites into an alternative location. This may imply that additional sequences surrounding the core are required for full activity. Alternatively, moving the enhancer further away may prevent it from fully activating Nanog. Nonetheless, this demonstration of enhancer function represents a highly feasible, native chromatin approach to confirm that a DNA element is an enhancer. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the −5 CRE is an enhancer, and we will hereafter refer to it as the −5 SE (14Whyte W.A. Orlando D.A. Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lin C.Y. Kagey M.H. Rahl P.B. Lee T.I. Young R.A. Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key cell identity genes.Cell. 2013; 153: 307-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). Several groups have demonstrated that, within a super-enhancer, a single, smaller constituent enhancer is required for proper SE function, with the remaining constituent enhancers being dispensable for regulating gene expression (26Huang J. Liu X. Li D. Shao Z. Cao H. Zhang Y. Trompouki E. Bowman T.V. Zon L.I. Yuan G.C. Orkin S.H. Xu J. Dynamic control of enhancer repertoires drives lineage and stage-specific transcription during hematopoiesis.Dev. Cell. 2016; 36: 9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To determine if the −5 SE has a dominant constituent enhancer, we first reviewed published chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets from other groups to determine if there were constituent enhancers within the larger −5 SE. We observed that there were two distinct regions occupied by the classic pluripotency transcription factors Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 (NOS, Fig. 4A). To determine if one or both constituent enhancers were critical to pluripotency, we deleted each individually with CRISPR-Cas9 using a pair of distinct guide RNAs (gRNAs) (Fig. 4, A–B, Fig. S3F). It is surprising that we were able to recover biallelically deleted clones of the individual 5’ or 3’ constituent enhancers without difficulty. Deletion of either the 5’ or 3’ constituent enhancer results in an approximately 50% reduction in Nanog mRNA, but these reductions were insufficient to alter pluripotency as measured by Oct4, Esrrb, or Klf4 expression (Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that neither the 5’ nor the 3’ constituent enhancer is required for pluripotency, even though together they promote normal Nanog expression. Thus, the two constituent enhancers function in an additive fashion and are required for proper Nanog expression. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that monoallelic deletion of the −5 SE, biallelic deletion of the −45 SE, and biallelic deletion of the +60 SE have different effects on Nanog expression despite each enhancer physically interacting with the gene, as shown by chromosomal conformation capture (7Blinka S.

Super-enhancers at the Nanog locus differentially regulate neighboring pluripotency-associated genes.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 19-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Specifically, deletion of the −45 SE causes a 50% decrease in Nanog expression, whereas deletion of the +60 SE had no change in Nanog expression. Work from this study has further shown that the −5 SE is critical to Nanog expression, as there is a 90% decrease in Nanog expression upon biallelic deletion (Fig. 1E, right). We hypothesized that each enhancer may operate on distinct su"

In nature, bacteria frequently adopt a sessile life cycle in response to environmental cues that promote the formation of surface-attached biofilms (1Davey M.E. O’Toole G.A. Microbial biofilms: from ecology to molecular genetics.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 847-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Biofilms consist of bacterial cells embedded in a self-assembled matrix composed of lipids, exported protein, extracellular DNA, and exopolysaccharides that are known collectively as the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) (2Flemming H.-C. Wingender J. The biofilm matrix.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). The exact composition of the EPS varies depending on the bacterial species and on environmental factors, but it serves the same function in all contexts: facilitating cell–cell adhesion and acting as a protective barrier (3Costerton J.W.

The first is a cationic polysaccharide with approximately 15% of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) de-N-acetylated, and the second is zwitterionic as a result of both partial de-N-acetylation and periodic O-succinylation of the GlcNAc residues (16Mack D.

The PgaB GH domain catalyzes endoglycosidic cleavage of partially de-N-acetylated PNAG substrates containing a glucosamine (GlcN) in the −3 binding site (29Little D.J. Pfoh R. Mauff F.L. Bamford N.C.

Despite interest in these enzymes as biofilm dispersal agents and as treatments for biofilm-dependent infections, there is still relatively little known about the specific binding interactions required for recognition of their respective PNAG substrates. This is particularly true for DspB. Efforts to engineer more catalytically active variants of DspB as antibiofilm therapeutics would benefit from detailed information about the specific interactions that contribute to substrate recognition and turnover. In a recent study, we showed that de-N-acetylation of PNAG oligosaccharide analogs influences both the mechanism and rate of hydrolysis of DspB for synthetic substate analogs (i.e., 1 and 2) (33Wang S. Breslawec A.P. Alvarez E. Tyrlik M. Li C. Poulin M.B. Differential recognition of deacetylated PNAG oligosaccharides by a biofilm degrading glycosidase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 9: 1998-2005Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specifically, we found that trisaccharide 2 containing GlcN at the +2 binding site showed a nearly threefold faster rate of exoglycosidic cleavage when compared with fully acetylated trisaccharide analog 1. These results indicate that the substrate cationic charge may contribute to substrate recognition by DspB through interactions with anionic amino acids. Here we use a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme activity assays with synthetic PNAG substrate analogs, and in vitro biofilm dispersal measurements to test this hypothesis and identify amino acids involved in PNAG substrate recognition. These results suggest that mutations outside the DspB catalytic pocket influence PNAG hydrolysis activity and can be used to improve the dispersal of PNAG dependent S. epidermidis biofilms by DspB. Our recent studies of DspB activity using synthetic PNAG trisaccharide analogs with defined acetylation patterns (1–3) revealed that specific de-N-acetylation patterns influence the rate of substrate hydrolysis by DspB (33Wang S. Breslawec A.P. Alvarez E. Tyrlik M. Li C. Poulin M.B. Differential recognition of deacetylated PNAG oligosaccharides by a biofilm degrading glycosidase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 9: 1998-2005Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Specifically, hydrolysis of the cationic substrate 2 was nearly threefold faster than for either fully acetylated substrate 1 or cationic substrate 3 containing GlcN as the central residue. These results suggest a hypothesis that the increased hydrolysis of 2 may result from specific charge–charge interaction with the cationic GlcN in the +2 binding site (Fig. 1A). To test this further, a substrate analog 4 containing glucose (Glc) at the +2 site was synthesized. The acetylation pattern of 4 is the same as that of analog 2 but lacks the cationic charge at the +2 binding site. Analog 4 was synthesized using a one-pot sequential glycosylation approach developed for the synthesis of 1 to 3 (33Wang S. Breslawec A.P. Alvarez E. Tyrlik M. Li C. Poulin M.B. Differential recognition of deacetylated PNAG oligosaccharides by a biofilm degrading glycosidase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 9: 1998-2005Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), as described in detail in the supporting information. Reaction progress curves for the hydrolysis of 4 by DspB were determined by analyzing the reducing-end product distribution by HPLC (33Wang S. Breslawec A.P. Alvarez E. Tyrlik M. Li C. Poulin M.B. Differential recognition of deacetylated PNAG oligosaccharides by a biofilm degrading glycosidase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 9: 1998-2005Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This assay allows for quantification of the remaining substrate and reducing-end products resulting from hydrolysis of 4 based on relative HPLC peak areas using the absorbance of the S-tolyl aglycone at 254 nm (Fig. 1B). The reaction progress curves for hydrolysis of 4 are consistent with sequential exoglycosidic cleavage of the trisaccharide and are consistent with the mechanism observed previously for hydrolysis of 1 to 3 (33Wang S. Breslawec A.P. Alvarez E. Tyrlik M. Li C. Poulin M.B. Differential recognition of deacetylated PNAG oligosaccharides by a biofilm degrading glycosidase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 9: 1998-2005Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The observed rate of hydrolysis (kobs) was determined by fitting the curve for disappearance of the trisaccharide substrate as a function of time to a single exponential using Equation 1 where [Eο] is the initial enzyme concentration, [Sο] is the initial trisaccharide concentration, and [S] is the trisaccharide concentration remaining at time t.[S]=[S∘]×e(–kobs[E∘]t)(1) The rate of hydrolysis of 4 was nearly identical to that of 1 and 3 and threefold lower than the rate of hydrolysis of cationic analog 2 (Fig. 1C). This supports the hypothesis that the increased hydrolysis rate observed with 2 results from recognition of the cationic charge of the substrate and not simply as a result of deacetylation. To further test this hypothesis and determine the specific interactions responsible for recognition of the cationic PNAG analogs, we analyzed the structure of DspB in greater detail. A crystal structure for the DspB apoprotein was reported in 2005 (36Ramasubbu N. Thomas L.M. Ragunath C. Kaplan J.B.

DspB is classified as a Family 20 glycosyl hydrolase according to the Carbohydrate Active enZYmes (CAZy) database (37Lombard V. Ramulu H.G. Drula E. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B.

https://openalex.org/W3111428717,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a poor-prognosis disease with puzzling pathogenesis and inconclusive treatments. We develop a mathematical model of ALS based on a system of interactive feedback loops, focusing on the mutant SOD1 G93A mouse. Misfolded mutant SOD1 aggregates in motor neuron (MN) mitochondria and triggers a first loop characterized by oxidative phosphorylation impairment, AMP kinase over-activation, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK3) rise, glucose metabolism shift from pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to glycolysis, cell redox unbalance, and further worsening of mitochondrial dysfunction. Oxidative stress then triggers a second loop, involving the excitotoxic glutamatergic cascade, with cytosolic Ca 2+ overload, increase of PFK3 expression, and further metabolic shift from PPP to glycolysis. Finally, cytosolic Ca 2+ rise is also detrimental to mitochondria and oxidative phosphorylation, thus closing a third loop. These three loops are overlapped and positive (including an even number of inhibitory steps), hence they form a candidate multistationary (bistable) system. To describe the system dynamics, we model the interactions among the functional agents with differential equations. The system turns out to admit two stable equilibria: the healthy state, with high oxidative phosphorylation and preferential PPP, and the pathological state, with AMP kinase activation, PFK3 over expression, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and MN degeneration. We demonstrate that the loop system is monotone: all functional agents consistently act toward the healthy or pathological condition, depending on low or high mutant SOD1 input. We also highlight that molecular interactions involving PFK3 are crucial, as their deletion disrupts the system’s bistability leading to a single healthy equilibrium point. Hence, our mathematical model unveils that promising ALS management strategies should be targeted to mechanisms that keep low PFK3 expression and activity within MNs."

The complement system, comprising more than 30 proteins in plasma and on cell surfaces, is a key element of the innate immune system and a primary mechanism of host defense against pathogens. It also functions as an important link to the adaptive immune and coagulation systems (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D.

Human complement receptor 1 (HuCR1), also known as CD35, is type I membrane protein that forms part of a family of complement receptors that include CR2, CR3, and CR4 (5Liu D. Niu Z.X. The structure, genetic polymorphisms, expression and biological functions of complement receptor type 1 (CR1/CD35).Immunopharmacol. Immunotoxicol. 2009; 31: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is expressed on erythrocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, B and some T cells, mast cells, glomerular podocytes, and follicular dendritic cells (30Ahearn J.M. Fearon D.T. Structure and function of the complement receptors, CR1 (CD35) and CR2 (CD21).Adv. Immunol. 1989; 46: 183-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of HuCR1 is 1971 amino acids long and composed of 30 short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, each of approximately 60 amino acids and of variable homology to each other (31Krych-Goldberg M. Atkinson J.P. Structure-function relationships of complement receptor type 1.Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Weis J.H. Morton C.C. Bruns G.A. Weis J.J.

SCR domains 1 to 28 of HuCR1 are further arranged into four long homologous repeat (LHR) domains, each consisting of seven SCR domains (31Krych-Goldberg M. Atkinson J.P.

Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1095-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Very low levels (approximately 50 ng/ml) of soluble HuCR1 occur naturally in plasma, likely produced as a consequence of proteolytic shedding (34Karthikeyan G. Baalasubramanian S. Seth S. Das N. Low levels of plasma soluble complement receptor type 1 in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 2007; 23: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). HuCR1 has multiple functions. It acts as the receptor for both C3b and C4b, and to a lesser extent, iC3b and C3dg (35Cooper N.R.

It also acts as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, and for further cleavage of iC3b to C3dg and C3c (38Medof M.E. Iida K. Mold C. Nussenzweig V.

Complement receptor is an inhibitor of the complement cascade.J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 1138-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The third main function of HuCR1 is to regulate complement by accelerating convertase decay via binding to C3b or C4b and displacing C2a or Bb in the C3 or C5 convertases (36Fearon D.T.

A recombinant, soluble, and full extracellular domain form of HuCR1 comprising of all 28 SCR domains and known as TP-10 has previously been developed for therapeutic use (55Li J.S. Jaggers J.

Two clinical trials examining the effect of TP-10–mediated complement inhibition in patients during cardiopulmonary bypass demonstrated a gender-specific effect, with only males showing clinically significant improvement (57Lazar H.L.

However, a study testing TP-10 at 10 mg/kg in 59 lung transplant recipients (59Keshavjee S. Davis R.D. Zamora M.R. de Perrot M. Patterson G.A.

In addition, the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced to 10.6 days in TP-10–treated patients compared with 21.5 days in standard-of-care patients (59Keshavjee S. Davis R.D.

This clinical trial data show that not only that a soluble CR1 has potential value as a therapeutic but also the choice of indication is important. In this report, we assessed the role of individual and combined HuCR1 LHR domains by comparing their complement inhibitory activity as soluble proteins in both ELISA-based and red blood cell hemolytic assays. From these in vitro studies, we identified and characterized CSL040, a truncated soluble variant of HuCR1 lacking the LHR-D domain exhibiting greater in vitro potency and an extended in vivo half-life compared with full-length HuCR1. We demonstrated the importance of sialylation to reduce in vivo clearance rate of CSL040 as well as its ability to attenuate damage in vivo in a mouse model of immune complex–mediated kidney injury. We sought to identify potential therapeutic candidates based on HuCR1 by determining the relative contributions of the LHR domains of soluble HuCR1 to its overall potency in vitro. A series of recombinant soluble N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants were generated that lacked 1, 2, or 3 of its four LHR domains (Fig. 1) and were shown to be monomeric by SDS–PAGE (Fig. S1). These proteins were purified, and their potencies compared with the full-length extracellular domain HuCR1(1971) in vitro. Using the Wieslab complement system kits for all three complement pathways or red blood cell hemolytic assays specific for the CP and AP (Table 1), we showed that purified single LHR domain variants of HuCR1 had greatly reduced complement inhibitory activity in vitro compared with HuCR1(1971). Indeed, recombinant HuCR1(1393–1971) had no detectable activity (Table 1) in any of the assays employed. Mutants with three contiguous LHR domains (LHR-AB, LHR-BC, and LHR-CD) exhibited increased inhibitory activity compared with singly expressed LHR domains, with HuCR1(939) generally being more potent than HuCR1(490–1392) and HuCR1(940–1971) (Table 1). HuCR1(490–1971) had lower activity than soluble full-length HuCR1(1971), particularly as measured in the hemolytic assays; although for some assays, this was not determined to be statistically significant (Table 1). Surprisingly, HuCR1(1392) containing LHR-ABC was a significantly more potent inhibitor than full-length HuCR1(1971), of two of three pathways in the Wieslab assay, and both hemolytic assays (Table 1). The potency improvements for HuCR1(1392) over HuCR1(1971) were found to be approximately twofold for both the CP and lectin pathway–specific assays and approximately threefold for both Wieslab and hemolytic AP assays (Table 1). Removal of the histidine (His)-tag from HuCR1(1392) had no effect on its potency in vitro (Fig. S2). HuCR1(1392) was designated as CSL040 and is described as such in the remainder of the article.Table 1Potency of human soluble CR1 truncation variants in complement pathway–specific Wieslab and red blood cell hemolytic assaysHuCR1 truncationsWieslab IC50 (nM) ± SEMHemolytic IC50 (nM) ± SEMConstructLHR domainsClassicalLectinAlternativeClassicalAlternativeHuCR1(1971)ABCD1.28 ± 0.261.05 ± 0.170.53 ± 0.291.21 ± 0.212.71 ± 0.94HuCR1(1392)/CSL040ABC0.53 ± 0.33ap < 0.05.0.47 ± 0.16ap < 0.05.0.17 ± 0.100.42 ± 0.10bp < 0.005.0.90 ± 0.54ap < 0.05.HuCR1(490–1971)BCD4.18 ± 2.493.12 ± 0.59bp < 0.005.0.29 ± 0.1732.96 ± 15.34ap < 0.05.76.85 ± 49.15HuCR1(939)AB2.59 ± 1.301.87 ± 0.641.31 ± 1.824.61 ± 1.85ap < 0.05.13.15 ± 2.18bp < 0.005.HuCR1(490–1392)BC10.06 ± 2.55bp < 0.005.5.80 ± 0.65cp < 0.0005.0.70 ± 0.3610.08 ± 5.52ap < 0.05.12.48 ± 4.30ap < 0.05.HuCR1(940–1971)CD98.57 ± 71.68120.74 ± 49.29ap < 0.05.1.26 ± 1.17677.80 ± 278.35ap < 0.05.95.51 ± 21.06bp < 0.005.HuCR1(489)A36.91 ± 7.25bp < 0.005.22.35 ± 14.361.10 ± 1.4368.38 ± 9.52cp < 0.0005.49.87 ± 24.76ap < 0.05.HuCR1(490–939)BNo activityNo activity8.18 ± 9.63959.37 ± 243.92bp < 0.005.63.38 ± 31.03ap < 0.05.HuCR1(940–1392)CNo activity1879.7 ± 1545.30.79 ± 0.61733.10 ± 203.47bp < 0.005.66.36 ± 18.10bp < 0.005.HuCR1(1393–1971)DNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityNo activityThe IC50 values listed are the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.

Structure-function relationships of complement receptor type 1.Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we examined the affinity of CSL040 for these ligands by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Both the C3b and C4b used were commercially sourced plasma-derived proteins that under nonreducing conditions appeared predominantly monomeric (Fig. S3). However, a noticeable dimeric fraction was also observed for both C3b and C4b. As shown in Figure 2A and Table 2, the affinity of CSL040 to human C3b was determined by SPR to be 264.6 ± 14.4 nM, whereas the control HuCR1(1971) affinity was measured at 385.7 ± 17.1 nM (Fig. 2B and Table 2). This difference was small but statistically significant (p = 0.0007). Binding of human C4b to CSL040 (Fig. 2C) and HuCR1(1971) (Fig. 2D) was also observed, but no affinity measurements could be determined as the interaction was biphasic and could not be fitted to a 1:1 model (Table 2). However, there were no qualitative difference in the binding of CSL040 to human C4b compared with HuCR1(1971). These data demonstrate that removal of the LHR-D domain has no or minimal effect on the binding of CSL040 to C3b or C4b and suggests that the improved potency of CSL040 is likely not because of increased ligand-binding affinity.Table 2Kinetic rate constants and affinity of plasma-derived human C3b and C4b binding to CSL040 or HuCR1(1971)ReceptorLigandka (1/Ms)kd (1/s)KD (nM)CSL040C3b2.48 × 1046.54 × 10−3264.6 ± 14.3HuCR1(1971)1.96 × 1047.54 × 10−3385.7 ± 17.1CSL040/HuCR1(1971)C4bBiphasic (nonfitted)KD indicated as mean ± SD (N = 3); p = 0.0007; unpaired t test.

https://openalex.org/W3111140635,"Cohesin is a multiprotein ring complex that regulates 3D genome organization, sister chromatid cohesion, gene expression, and DNA repair. Cohesin is known to be ubiquitinated, although the mechanism, regulation, and effects of cohesin ubiquitination remain poorly defined. We previously used gene editing to introduce a dual epitope tag into the endogenous allele of each of 11 known components of cohesin in human HCT116 cells. Here we report that mass spectrometry analysis of dual-affinity purifications identified the USP13 deubiquitinase as a novel cohesin-interacting protein. Subsequent immunoprecipitation/Western blots confirmed the endogenous interaction in HCT116, 293T, HeLa, and RPE-hTERT cells; demonstrated that the interaction occurs specifically in the soluble nuclear fraction (not in the chromatin); requires the ubiquitin-binding domains (UBA1/2) of USP13; and occurs preferentially during DNA replication. Reciprocal dual-affinity purification of endogenous USP13 followed by mass spectrometry demonstrated that cohesin is its primary interactor in the nucleus. Ectopic expression and CRISPR knockout of USP13 showed that USP13 is paradoxically required for both deubiquitination and ubiquitination of cohesin subunits in human cells. USP13 was dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion in HCT116 and HeLa cells, whereas it was required for the dissociation of cohesin from chromatin as cells transit through mitosis. Together these results identify USP13 as a new cohesin-interacting protein that regulates the ubiquitination of cohesin and its cell cycle regulated interaction with chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W3111600558,"In smooth muscle, cytoglobin (Cygb) functions as a potent nitric oxide (NO) dioxygenase and regulates NO metabolism and vascular tone. Major questions remain regarding which cellular reducing systems regulate Cygb-mediated NO metabolism. To better define the Cygb-mediated NO dioxygenation process in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and the requisite reducing systems that regulate cellular NO decay, we assessed the intracellular concentrations of Cygb and its putative reducing systems and examined their roles in the process of NO decay. Cygb and the reducing systems, cytochrome b5 (B5)/cytochrome b5 reductase (B5R) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) were measured in aortic SMCs. Intracellular Cygb concentration was estimated as 3.5 μM, while B5R, B5, and CPR were 0.88, 0.38, and 0.15 μM, respectively. NO decay in SMCs was measured following bolus addition of NO to air-equilibrated cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments indicated that ∼78% of NO metabolism in SMCs is Cygb-dependent. Of this, ∼87% was B5R- and B5-dependent. CPR knockdown resulted in a small decrease in the NO dioxygenation rate (VNO), while depletion of ascorbate had no effect. Kinetic analysis of VNO for the B5/B5R/Cygb system with variation of B5 or B5R concentrations from their SMC levels showed that VNO exhibits apparent Michaelis–Menten behavior for B5 and B5R. In contrast, linear variation was seen with change in Cygb concentration. Overall, B5/B5R was demonstrated to be the major reducing system supporting Cygb-mediated NO metabolism in SMCs with changes in cellular B5/B5R levels modulating the process of NO decay. In smooth muscle, cytoglobin (Cygb) functions as a potent nitric oxide (NO) dioxygenase and regulates NO metabolism and vascular tone. Major questions remain regarding which cellular reducing systems regulate Cygb-mediated NO metabolism. To better define the Cygb-mediated NO dioxygenation process in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and the requisite reducing systems that regulate cellular NO decay, we assessed the intracellular concentrations of Cygb and its putative reducing systems and examined their roles in the process of NO decay. Cygb and the reducing systems, cytochrome b5 (B5)/cytochrome b5 reductase (B5R) and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) were measured in aortic SMCs. Intracellular Cygb concentration was estimated as 3.5 μM, while B5R, B5, and CPR were 0.88, 0.38, and 0.15 μM, respectively. NO decay in SMCs was measured following bolus addition of NO to air-equilibrated cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments indicated that ∼78% of NO metabolism in SMCs is Cygb-dependent. Of this, ∼87% was B5R- and B5-dependent. CPR knockdown resulted in a small decrease in the NO dioxygenation rate (VNO), while depletion of ascorbate had no effect. Kinetic analysis of VNO for the B5/B5R/Cygb system with variation of B5 or B5R concentrations from their SMC levels showed that VNO exhibits apparent Michaelis–Menten behavior for B5 and B5R. In contrast, linear variation was seen with change in Cygb concentration. Overall, B5/B5R was demonstrated to be the major reducing system supporting Cygb-mediated NO metabolism in SMCs with changes in cellular B5/B5R levels modulating the process of NO decay. Nitric oxide (NO), generated through activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in blood vessels, causes smooth muscle relaxation with vasodilation that enhances tissue perfusion (1Ignarro L.J.

The NO, formed in the endothelium, diffuses to reach the vascular smooth muscle layer of blood vessels. In smooth muscle cells (SMCs), soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) binds NO, with the formation of cGMP, which induces SMC relaxation and vasodilation (1Ignarro L.J.

While the process of NO formation and signaling has been extensively studied and is well understood, many questions remain regarding the process of NO decay and how this is regulated (4Li H.

Endothelium-generated NO that diffuses into the lumen of vessels is metabolized by the hemoglobin-rich erythrocytes, which contain high millimolar levels of oxy-Hb (23Herold S. Exner M. Nauser T.

However, questions have remained regarding the metabolism of NO as it diffuses into the smooth muscle containing vessel wall. Until recently, the underlying mechanism of NO metabolism in smooth muscle was unclear, with myoglobin and cytoglobin proposed as vascular NOD, and Hb-α was recently proposed to have a role in NOD in myoendothelial junctions (8Zweier J.L.

Recent studies have reported that Cygb is the major NOD in vascular SMCs and in the vessel wall (5Liu X. El-Mahdy M.A. Boslett J. Varadharaj S. Hemann C. Abdelghany T.M. Ismail R.S. Little S.C.

Commun. 2017; 8: 14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This was found to be due to the much higher expression levels of Cygb than other globins such as myoglobin or Hb that were only present in trace levels 40- to >200-fold lower than Cygb, respectively (5Liu X.

In addition, from studies of isolated protein systems, the rate of NOD by Cygb has been shown to be much higher than these other globins, due to its more rapid reduction rate with a variety of reductants, such as ascorbate, or reducing systems, such as P450 reductase (CPR) or cytochrome b5/b5 reductase (B5/B5R). Cygb was also shown to be unique in the O2-sensitivity of its NOD function, whereby it can provide O2 sensing with a lower NOD rate under conditions of physiological hypoxia (7Liu X. Follmer D.

Further studies in Cygb knockout mice demonstrated that Cygb has a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and NO decay. In these mice with genetic deletion of Cygb, vascular dilation was seen along with decreased systemic blood pressure and lower systemic vascular resistance (5Liu X. El-Mahdy M.A. Boslett J.

The NOD function of Cygb and other globins depends on the capacity to generate and regenerate the catalytic oxy-ferrous species (Fe2+O2) that mediates the dioxygenation of NO.

Once the heme is reduced, O2 rapidly binds to the Fe2+ to form the oxy-ferrous species, Fe2+O2. Fe2+O2 reacts with NO to generate NO3−, with regeneration of Fe3+ heme, and this catalytic cycle continues (7Liu X. Follmer D. Zweier J.R. Huang X. Hemann C. Liu K. Druhan L.J. Zweier J.L.

From prior studies of Cygb, both ascorbate and the enzyme reducing systems B5/B5R and CPR are highly effective in reduction of the heme; however, much higher levels of ascorbate are required than for the enzyme systems to support a given rate of reduction. Since ascorbate can be present up to millimolar levels in cells, while the enzyme reducing systems were thought to be well below micromolar, it had been hypothesized that ascorbate as well as the enzyme reducing systems could play a role in supporting the process of NOD in SMCs (7Liu X. Follmer D. Zweier J.R. Huang X. Hemann C. Liu K. Druhan L.J. Zweier J.L. Characterization of the function of cytoglobin as an oxygen-dependent regulator of nitric oxide concentration.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5072-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Gardner A.M.

Chem. 2010; 285: 23850-23857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of ascorbate in Cygb reduction has been questioned (29Amdahl M.B. Sparacino-Watkins C.E. Corti P. Gladwin M.T. Tejero J. Efficient reduction of vertebrate cytoglobins by the cytochrome b5/cytochrome b5 reductase/NADH system.Biochemistry. 2017; 56: 3993-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In order to understand the process of NOD in SMCs and how this may regulate vascular function, it is important to know the concentration of Cygb and each reducing system that supports this process. With this information, one can then model and predict the rate of NO decay in these cells and how this may modulate vascular function and tone. In spite of detailed in vitro studies measuring the NOD activity of Cygb, to date there is a lack of knowledge regarding the specific reducing systems that regulate its NOD activity in SMCs and their relative importance. These reducing systems are of critical importance for regeneration of active oxy-ferrous Cygb required for NO dioxygenation. There is a critical lack of knowledge on the expression levels of Cygb and its requisite reducing systems in SMCs and how this regulates NOD activity. This information on the redox regulation of Cygb in SMCs is required to understand its process of NO dioxygenation and how this regulates NO-induced vasorelaxation with regulation of vascular tone. Therefore, in the current work, studies were performed in mouse aortic SMCs to measure and quantitate the levels of Cygb as well as the major enzyme reducing systems including B5/B5R and CPR that are proposed to regulate its NOD function. The effects of knockdown of each of these proteins involved in NO metabolism were determined and also compared with the effects of depletion or supplementation of ascorbate. Our studies establish that Cygb provides most of the NOD function of SMCs, and B5/B5R was shown to be its major reducing system, while CPR has a significant but lesser role. In contrast, ascorbate depletion had no significant effect on NO metabolism. Based on the measured levels of Cygb and its reducing system in SMCs, we experimentally model the effects of changes in these levels on the rate of NO decay and consider the effects this will have on the process of NO metabolism that regulates vascular tone. It is expected that the rate of NO metabolism in cell suspensions would be proportional to the density of the cells and NO metabolizing proteins, with the greater the cell number, the higher the rate of NOD and decay. However, there may be an upper limit on the cell density to prevent cell aggregation as well as metabolic ischemia. In order to determine the best range of cell density values in suspension to provide reproducible measurements of NO decay rates, initial experiments were performed to measure the rate of NO metabolism as a function of the number of SMCs per volume (Fig. 1). We evaluated three different cell densities, 1.75, 3.5, and 7 × 106 cells•ml−1. NO decay was measured following addition of a bolus of NO sufficient to reach a 1 μM initial NO concentration in the 2 ml cell suspension. As we have previously shown, using quantitative HPLC, more than 90% NO metabolism occurs in SMCs through the NOD reaction with the production of nitrate (NO3−) (5Liu X. El-Mahdy M.A. Boslett J. Varadharaj S. Hemann C. Abdelghany T.M. Ismail R.S. Little S.C. Zhou D. Thuy L.T. Kawada N. Zweier J.L. Cytoglobin regulates blood pressure and vascular tone through nitric oxide metabolism in the vascular wall.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14807Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Typical tracings of the NO concentration change over time are shown for the three different cell concentrations (Fig. 1A). With higher numbers of SMCs/ml, more rapid decay of NO was seen. Quantitative measurement of rates of NO metabolism (VNO) was performed, from the slope of the initial decay (VNO=Δc/Δt), as previously described (7Liu X. Follmer D. Zweier J.R. Huang X. Hemann C. Liu K. Druhan L.J. Zweier J.L. Characterization of the function of cytoglobin as an oxygen-dependent regulator of nitric oxide concentration.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5072-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data from repeat NO decay measurements corrected for the rates of NO decomposition (Vd) in cell-free buffer was used to generate plots of VNO versus cell density (Fig. 1B). With 1.75 and 3.5 × 106 cells•ml−1 a clear increase in VNO was seen with cell number. With a further doubling of cell numbers to 7 × 106 cells•ml−1, while a further increase was seen, the VNO per cell decreased as the curve started to plateau (Fig. 1B). This may be due to concentration-dependent cell aggregation and settling, or the limited availability of metabolic substrates for this high cell density in the measurement chamber. Based on this data, we utilized a cell density of 3.5 × 106 cells•ml−1 in our subsequent studies to maintain a high rate of NO decay while avoiding the saturation seen with higher cell densities. While O2 is required for NOD with O2 availability critical for NO metabolism by Cygb, the dependence of NO decay on the O2 level in SMCs has not been previously measured. We have previously observed in isolated protein studies using purified Cygb that the NOD reaction is O2-dependent with apparent Michaelis–Menten kinetics (7Liu X. Follmer D. Zweier J.R. Huang X.

Characterization of the function of cytoglobin as an oxygen-dependent regulator of nitric oxide concentration.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5072-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies were performed to measure the effect of O2 levels on NO metabolism by SMCs. For these studies, NO and O2 were simultaneously measured by polarographic electrodes (Fig. 2, A–B). In these experiments, repeated bolus injections of 1 μM NO were added to 3.5 × 106 cells•ml−1 at ∼ 4 min intervals with simultaneous measurements of the NO and O2 concentrations present in the cell suspensions. After several recordings of the cell suspensions with flow of purified air over the solution surface, the air stream was stopped and then flow of argon initiated to accelerate the decline in O2 to near anaerobic levels. NO metabolism rate following each bolus addition of NO was determined and plotted against the corresponding O2 concentration as determined from the simultaneous measurements, as shown in Figure 2C. The plot of NO consumption with respect to [O2] shows a hyperbolic dependence with progressive decrease as the O2 concentration drops below 200 μM. Thus, with physiological hypoxia, as O2 levels decline, the NOD rate would also decline with lower rate of NO metabolism that could trigger a compensatory vasodilation. The level of Cygb expression in SMCs and the effectiveness of siRNA treatment in knocking down its expression level were determined by quantitative immunoblotting, using known concentrations of purified Cygb as standard. Representative blots and quantitative analyses of blot densities are shown (Fig. 3). The first three bands correspond to known amounts of purified Cygb. Bands 4 and 5 were obtained from equal loading of homogenates of scr-RNA treated cells and matched Cygb siRNA-treated cells. From the band intensities of known concentrations of Cygb, blotted along with cell lysates, the intracellular concentration of Cygb in mouse SMCs was estimated to be 3.5 ± 0.2 μM. siRNA treatment of cells successfully reduced the Cygb expression by 87% in SMCs. NO metabolism both in control SMCs and in those with Cygb knockdown was measured, as described above, following bolus addition of 1 μM NO to the"

Mutations within eIF2B result in the fatal disease, leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM). Previous biochemical studies on VWM mutations have illustrated that changes in the activity of eIF2B poorly correlate with disease severity. This suggests that there may be additional characteristics of eIF2B contributing to VWM pathogenesis. Here, we investigated whether the localization of eIF2B to eIF2B bodies was integral for function and whether this localization could provide insight into the pathogenesis of VWM. We demonstrate that the regulatory subunit, eIF2Bα, is required for the assembly of eIF2B bodies in yeast and that loss of eIF2B bodies correlates with an inability of cells to regulate eIF2B activity. Mutational analysis of eIF2Bα showed that missense mutations that disrupt the regulation of eIF2B similarly disrupt the assembly of eIF2B bodies. In contrast, when eIF2Bα mutations that impact the catalytic activity of eIF2B were analyzed, eIF2B bodies were absent and instead eIF2B localized to small foci, termed microfoci. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis highlighted that within these microfoci, eIF2 shuttles more slowly indicating that formation of eIF2B bodies correlates with full eIF2B activity. When eIF2Bα VWM mutations were analyzed, a diverse impact on localization was observed, which did not seem to correlate with eIF2B activity. These findings provide key insights into how the eIF2B body assembles and suggest that the body is a fundamental part of the translational regulation via eIF2α phosphorylation.

Eukaryotic genomes encode many thousands of proteins, and through the process of protein synthesis from mRNA or translation, the cell can rapidly control its gene expression profile to promote cellular homeostasis. The initiation step of translation is rate limiting and therefore provides a critical control point in gene expression. The highly conserved heterotrimeric G-protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), is essential for the initiation and regulation of translation. In its active GTP bound form, eIF2 binds to a methionyl initiator tRNA molecule to form a ternary complex (1Merrick W.C. Pavitt G.D. Protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotic cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10a033092Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Facilitated by a number of eIFs, the ternary complex is loaded onto the 40S ribosomal subunit and recruited to a target mRNA molecule, allowing for subsequent ribosomal scanning and start codon recognition (1Merrick W.C. Pavitt G.D. Protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotic cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10a033092Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Upon start codon recognition, eIF2–GTP is hydrolyzed by the GTPase-activating protein, eIF5 (2Huang H.K. Yoon H. Hannig E.M. Donahue T.F. GTP hydrolysis controls stringent selection of the AUG start codon during translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2396-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and is released from the ribosome in its inactive GDP bound form, in complex with eIF5 (1Merrick W.C. Pavitt G.D. Protein synthesis initiation in eukaryotic cells.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10a033092Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For subsequent rounds of translation to occur within the cell, active eIF2–GTP must be replenished. eIF2 has a higher affinity for GDP than GTP (3Erickson F.L. Hannig E.M. Ligand interactions with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2: role of the gamma-subunit.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6311-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and therefore, the multisubunit protein eIF2B is required to catalyze this guanine nucleotide exchange (4Pavitt G.D. Regulation of translation initiation factor eIF2B at the hub of the integrated stress response.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9e1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In yeast, eIF5 functions as a GDP dissociation inhibitor, preventing any spontaneous recycling of GDP to GTP on eIF2 (5Jennings M.D. Pavitt G.D. eIF5 has GDI activity necessary for translational control by eIF2 phosphorylation.Nature. 2010; 465: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in yeast, eIF2B also acts as a GDP dissociation inhibitor displacement factor, releasing eIF2–GDP from eIF5 (6Jennings M.D. Zhou Y. Mohammad-Qureshi S.S. Bennett D. Pavitt G.D. eIF2B promotes eIF5 dissociation from eIF2∗GDP to facilitate guanine nucleotide exchange for translation initiation.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 2696-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although functionally similar to other GEFs of the Ras superfamily, eIF2B has a much more complex quaternary structure. It is composed of five nonidentical subunits termed, α, β, δ, γ, and ε, encoded in yeast by the genes: GCN3, GCD7, GCD2, GCD1, and GCD6, respectively. The native form of eIF2B is composed of a dimer of heteropentamers and so is decameric (7Gordiyenko Y. Schmidt C. Jennings M.D. Matak-Vinkovic D. Pavitt G.D. Robinson C.V. eIF2B is a decameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor with a ɣ2 ε2 tetrameric core.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Wortham N.C. Martinez M. Gordiyenko Y. Robinson C.V. Proud C.G. Analysis of the subunit organization of the eIF2B complex reveals new insights into its structure and regulation.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 2225-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). eIF2Bγ–eIF2Bε heterodimers reside on both flanks of the structure and are responsible for the protein's GEF activity (4Pavitt G.D. Regulation of translation initiation factor eIF2B at the hub of the integrated stress response.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2018; 9e1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Heterodimers of eIF2Bβ and δ subunits bind eIF2Bγε heterodimers and reside in the core of the decameric arrangement, stabilized in this conformation by an eIF2Bα homodimer. Structural analysis of both yeast and mammalian eIF2B has provided models for how the decameric structure is formed and how eIF2 can interact with the decamer (9Kashiwagi K. Takahashi M. Nishimoto M.

Frost A. eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and phosphoregulation by the integrated stress response.Science. 2019; 364: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Wortham et al. (14Wortham N.C. Stewart J.D. Harris S. Coldwell M.J. Proud C.G. Stoichiometry of the eIF2B complex is maintained by mutual stabilization of subunits.Biochem. J. 2016; 473: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) identified that all eIF2B subunits, except eIF2Bα, are stoichiometrically regulated. Stable expression of eIF2Bε relies on similar levels of γ to be coexpressed; correspondingly, eIF2Bδ requires similar levels of eIF2Bεγ and β. Any surplus protein subunits are degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. This study indicated that the eIF2B holocomplex may be built around the eIF2Bεγβδ subcomplex, with eIF2Bα2 homodimers bridging two tetramers to complete the decameric holocomplex. In line with this model, Tsai et al. (15Tsai J.C. Miller-Vedam L.E. Anand A.A. Jaishankar P. Nguyen H.C. Renslo A.R. Frost A. Walter P. Structure of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B reveals mechanism of memory-enhancing molecule.Science. 2018; 359eaaq0939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in the absence of eIF2Bα, eIF2B exists as an eIF2Bεγβδ tetramer. The subunit complexity of eIF2B lends itself as a target of tight regulation. As the process of translation involves a significant amount of cellular energy, tight regulation is crucial in response to adverse cellular conditions. One of the best studied and most diverse mechanisms of translational control in response to cellular stress is the integrated stress response (ISR), known as the general amino acid control pathway in yeast (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Perk is essential for translational regulation and cell survival during the unfolded protein response.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar, 17Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Phosphorylation of initiation factor 2 alpha by protein kinase GCN2 mediates gene-specific translational control of GCN4 in yeast.Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The ISR involves a series of cellular stress–sensing pathways that regulate translation through the common mechanism of eIF2 phosphorylation (18Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, four eIF2α kinases exist, whereas in yeast, a single kinase, general control nonderepressible 2, is responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2α at serine 51 in response to amino acid starvation (19Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF2 at this site converts eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of eIF2B GEF activity. While the α, β, and δ subunits of eIF2B are dispensable for GEF activity, they are responsible for tight regulation of this activity by phosphorylated eIF2 (20Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Homologous segments in three subunits of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B mediate translational regulation by phosphorylation of eIF2.Mol.

The inhibition of eIF2B GEF activity induces global translational repression within the cell. Paradoxically, a number of stress-responsive proteins are translationally upregulated to favor homeostatic reprogramming (18Pakos-Zebrucka K. Koryga I. Mnich K. Ljujic M. Samali A. Gorman A.M. The integrated stress response.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17: 1374-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The translation of these proteins is most commonly controlled by the presence of upstream open reading frames in the 5'UTR of the mRNAs, first demonstrated in yeast for GCN4 mRNA (22Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Multiple upstream AUG codons mediate translational control of GCN4.Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies in both yeast and mammalian systems have solved structures of eIF2B bound to both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated eIF2α (9Kashiwagi K. Takahashi M. Nishimoto M.

Interestingly, although the structure of eIF2B is highly conserved across species (9Kashiwagi K. Takahashi M. Nishimoto M. Hiyama T.B. Higo T. Umehara T. Sakamoto K. Ito T. Yokoyama S.

Frost A. eIF2B-catalyzed nucleotide exchange and phosphoregulation by the integrated stress response.Science. 2019; 364: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), phosphorylated eIF2α appears to interact and inhibit eIF2B via distinct mechanisms within yeast and mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated eIF2α bind to different regions of eIF2B, whereas in yeast, they share a binding pocket (10Adomavicius T. Guaita M. Zhou Y. Jennings M.D. Latif Z. Roseman A.M. Pavitt G.D. The structural basis of translational control by eIF2 phosphorylation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). eIF2α binds to the eIF2B regulatory subunits, and this binding position is favorable for nucleotide exchange. Upon phosphorylation of eIF2α, conformational changes in its structure are believed to enhance the binding of eIF2α to eIF2Bα and δ subunits. It is this conformational change in eIF2B that displaces the catalytic domain of eIF2Bε, responsible for carrying out nucleotide exchange, from its original close proximity to eIF2, thus inhibiting nucleotide exchange (10Adomavicius T. Guaita M. Zhou Y. Jennings M.D. Latif Z. Roseman A.M. Pavitt G.D. The structural basis of translational control by eIF2 phosphorylation.Nat.

Localization studies in both yeast and mammalian systems have shown that eIF2B accumulates at specific foci within the cytoplasm of the cell (24Campbell S.G. Hoyle N.P. Ashe M.P.

Filament formation by the translation factor eIF2B regulates protein synthesis in starved cells.Biol. Open. 2020; 9bio046391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These foci have been termed eIF2B bodies and in yeast appear as one large cytoplasmic granule that morphologically exists as a filamentous-like structure. eIF2 also localizes to eIF2B bodies raising the possibility that eIF2B bodies are sites where eIF2B GEF activity occurs and is regulated within the cell. In 2005, Campbell et al. (24Campbell S.G. Hoyle N.P. Ashe M.P. Dynamic cycling of eIF2 through a large eIF2B-containing cytoplasmic body: implications for translation control.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae eIF2B is a stable component of eIF2B bodies, whereas the association of eIF2 is dynamic, with eIF2 transiting through the eIF2B body at a rate that correlates to the cellular level of eIF2B GEF activity. In 2010, Taylor et al. (26Taylor E.J. Campbell S.G. Griffiths C.D. Reid P.J. Slaven J.W. Harrison R.J. Sims P.F. Pavitt G.D. Delneri D. Ashe M.P. Fusel alcohols regulate translation initiation by inhibiting eIF2B to reduce ternary complex in a mechanism that may involve altering the integrity and dynamics of the eIF2B body.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 2202-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed that eIF2B bodies were motile throughout the cytoplasm. This movement is important for effective translation initiation as butanol treatment hinders eIF2B body movement, and this lack of movement correlates with the inhibition of translation initiation. These data provide evidence to suggest eIF2B bodies are sites of eIF2B GEF activity and regulation; however, recent interest in eIF2B bodies has provided some conflicting interpretations. One study has suggested that eIF2B bodies are not present in S. cerevisiae under steady-state growth, but only form under glucose-limiting conditions (28Moon S.L. Parker R. Analysis of eIF2B bodies and their relationships with stress granules and P-bodies.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 12264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another study highlighted that eIF2B bodies were not induced during acute glucose starvation but were formed upon energy depletion (during stationary phase) as a mechanism for sequestering eIF2B proteins to inhibit their function (30Marini G. Nüske E. Leng W. Alberti Sand Pigino G. Reorganization of budding yeast cytoplasm upon energy depletion.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2020; 31: 1232-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nüske E. Marini G.

Open. 2020; 9bio046391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of eIF2B assembly into eIF2B bodies for its function and regulation remains unclear. The importance of understanding eIF2B localization is heightened by the fact that in mammalian cells, mutations within eIF2B result in the fatal and autosomal recessive disease, leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) (32Leegwater P.A.J. Vermeulen G. Konst A.A.M. Naidu S. Mulders J. Visser A. Kersbergen P. Mobach D. Fonds D. van Berkel C.G.M. Lemmers R.J.L.F. Frants R.R. Oudejans C.B.M. Schutgens R.B.H. Pronk J.C. et al.Subunits of the translation initiation factor eIF2B are mutant in leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter.Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To date, over 200 VWM mutants have been identified spanning all five subunits (33Hamilton E.M.C. van der Lei H.D.W. Vermeulen G. Gerver J.A.M. Lourenço C.M. Naidu S. Mierzewska H. Gemke R.J.B.J. de Vet H.C.W. Uitdehaag B.M.J. et al.Natural history of vanishing white matter.Ann. Neurol. 2018; 84: 24-288Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The relationship between mutant eIF2B function and disease severity remains poor. VWM-causing mutations have been identified that affect neither decameric complex formation nor eIF2B activity in vitro but cause some of the most severe forms of VWM in vivo (34Liu R. van der Lei H.D.W. Wang X. Wortham N.C. Tang H. van Berkel C.G.M. Mufunde T.A. Huang W. van der Knaap M.S. Scheper G.C. et al.Severity of vanishing white matter disease does not correlate with deficits in eIF2B activity or the integrity of eIF2B complexes.Hum.

Biochemical effects of mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B associated with Vanishing White Matter disease.BMC Med. Genet. 2015; 16: 64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Understanding eIF2B body formation and regulation could uncover common pathophysiological mechanisms across the broad spectrum of causative mutations. Although GCN3, which encodes eIF2Bα, is the only nonessential eIF2B gene in yeast, it is still critical for stabilizing eIF2B in its decameric conformation and for the regulation of eIF2B activity during cellular stress. Here, we investigate the importance of eIF2Bα to eIF2B body assembly and activity. Using S. cerevisiae, we show that eIF2Bα (Gcn3p in S. cerevisiae) is central to the formation of eIF2B bodies and suggest that eIF2B bodies are a fundamental part of the translational regulation via eIF2α phosphorylation. In addition, VWM-causative mutations disrupt eIF2B body formation and regulation, providing the first evidence that eIF2B localization is altered by VWM-causing mutations. Using C-terminal yeGFP-tagged eIF2B subunits, we have previously shown that, during steady-state growth, all five subunits of eIF2B colocalize to eIF2B bodies (24Campbell S.G. Hoyle N.P. Ashe M.P.

Recently, a number of groups have presented conflicting data about whether these eIF2B bodies exist during steady-state growth or only form under specific starvation conditions (28Moon S.L. Parker R. Analysis of eIF2B bodies and their relationships with stress granules and P-bodies.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 12264Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Marini G. Nüske E. Leng W.

Open. 2020; 9bio046391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A potential explanation for these conflicting results is that different GFP tags may be influencing the aggregation of eIF2B. In order to investigate this, we first observed eIF2B body formation by individually tagging each eIF2B subunit with GFP and determining the percentage of cells in which eIF2B bodies were present. We hypothesized that if the eIF2B bodies that we have observed during steady-state growth were due to aggregation of the GFP tag, we would expect to observe a similar percentage of cells containing eIF2B bodies for all five GFP-tagged eIF2B subunits. A similar percentage of cells contained eIF2B bodies when the eIF2Bγ (48%), ε (51%), and β (56%) subunits were tagged, whereas a lower percentage of cells contained eIF2B bodies when eIF2Bα (20%) or δ (30%) subunits where tagged (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that it is unlikely that the GFP tag we have used is responsible for eIF2B body formation; rather, the ability of eIF2B to form bodies is influenced by the subunit that is tagged. Another possible explanation for differences in eIF2B body formation is variation between yeast strains, which are known to have differing responses to environmental stresses (36Petrezselyova S. Zahradka J. Sychrova H. Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 and W303-1A laboratory strains differ in salt tolerance.Fungal Biol. 2010; 114: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we have utilized S. cerevisiae W303-1A strain, whereas others have characterized eIF2B bodies in the BY4741 strain. To determine whether various laboratory strains localize eIF2B differently, the eIF2Bγ subunit was C terminally GFP tagged in the auxotrophic W303-1A, BY4741, and S288c background strains, and eIF2B localization was assessed. There was no difference in growth between strains (Fig. S1). During steady-state growth, a similar number of cells showing eIF2B bodies were observed for the W303-1A and S288c backgrounds (52% and 50%, respectively), whereas a significantly lower number of cells were observed to show eIF2B bodies in the BY4741 strain background (11%). To determine whether there was any change in the localization upon stress, the cells were subjected to acute glucose starvation (30 min) and amino acid starvation (15 min). Previously, we had observed that the level of fluorescence within eIF2B bodies increased upon amino acid starvation and that this was dependent on the phosphorylation of eIF2α (24Campbell S.G. Hoyle N.P. Ashe M.P. Dynamic cycling of eIF2 through a large eIF2B-containing cytoplasmic body: implications for translation control.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon amino acid starvation, an increase in the number of cells showing eIF2B bodies was observed for all strains (Fig. 1B). For the W303-1A and S288c strains, this increased percentage resulted in a 1.2-fold increase of cells with eIF2B bodies, whereas for the BY4741 strain, this increased percentage of cells represents a much greater 2.3-fold increase. In contrast to these increases, following glucose starvation, the number of cells displaying eIF2B bodies slightly decreased for all strains W303-1A, eIF2Bγ–GFP (46%), S288c, eIF2Bγ–GFP (37%), and BY4741 eIF2Bγ–GFP (6%); however, compared with synthetic complete media (SCD), these differences were not found to be statistically significant.

In previous work, we demonstrated that rat fimbria–fornix transection (FFT) enhances neurogenesis from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subgranular zone (SGZ). However, how neurogenesis is modulated after denervation remains unknown. Here, we investigated whether exosomes in a denervated hippocampal niche may affect neurogenesis. Using the FFT rat model, we extracted hippocampal exosomes and identified them using western blots, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nanoparticle size measurement. We also used RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of exosomes to identify noncoding RNA expression profiles and neurogenesis-related miRNAs, respectively. RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated 9 upregulated and 15 downregulated miRNAs. miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 increased gradually after FFT. Thus, we investigated the function of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 with NSC proliferation and differentiation assays. Transfection of miR-3559-3p and miR-6324 mimics inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and promoted the differentiation of NSCs into neurons, while miR-3559-3p and miR-6324 inhibitors promoted NSC proliferation and inhibited neuronal differentiation. Additionally, the exosome marker molecules CD9, CD63, and Alix were expressed in exosomes extracted from the hippocampal niche. Finally, TEM showed that exosomes were ∼100 nm in diameter and had a “saucer-like” bilayer membrane structure. Taken together, these findings suggest that differentially expressed exosomes and their related miRNAs in the denervated hippocampal niche can promote differentiation of NSCs into neurons.

Taken together, these findings suggest that differentially expressed exosomes and their related miRNAs in the denervated hippocampal niche can promote differentiation of NSCs into neurons. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are pluripotent and have the capability of self-renewal. They exist in the developing brain and almost all mammalian adult nervous systems (1Kovacs G.G. Concepts and classification of neurodegenerative diseases.Handb. Clin. Neurol. 2017; 145: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NSCs contribute to neurogenesis by generating neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, the three major cell types in the central nervous system (CNS). Manipulating their destiny has therapeutic promise in the treatment of adult brain injury and neurodegenerative disease (2Gottlieb D.I. Large-scale sources of neural stem cells.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 381-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Flax J.D. Aurora S. Yang C. Simonin C. Wills A.M. Billinghurst L.L. Jendoubi M. Sidman R.L. Wolfe J.H. Kim S.U. Snyder E.Y. Engraftable human neural stem cells respond to developmental cues, replace neurons, and express foreign genes.Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The factors affecting NSC differentiation into neurons are very complex. Activation of quiescent adult NSCs is coordinated by the interaction between external stimuli from the niche and internal factors such as transcription factors (TFs), signaling pathways, epigenetics, and metabolism. This interaction initiates the intracellular regulation process to promote quiescent NSC exit from the G0 phase into a new cell cycle (4Kim S.U. Genetically engineered human neural stem cells for brain repair in neurological diseases.Brain Dev. 2007; 29: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that NSCs transplanted into the subgranular zone (SGZ) of fimbria–fornix transection (FFT) brains exhibit strong proliferation and neuronal differentiation characteristics and formed a new neurogenic niche (5Shi J. Li H. Jin G. Zhu P. Tian M. Qin J. Tan X. Zhao S. Wang F. Hua Y. Xiao Y. Lhx8 promote differentiation of hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells into cholinergic neurons in vitro.In Vitro Cell Dev.

[Effects of Lhx8 in hippocampal cholinergic neural regeneration].Acta Anatomica Sinica. 2013; 44: 729-734Google Scholar). The neurogenic niche is a unique and specialized microenvironment that promotes NSC proliferation and differentiation toward the neuronal lineage. Intercellular communication is particularly important in the dynamic regulation of homeostasis and plasticity in adult neurogenesis. Various signaling molecules, including numerous cytokines, neurotransmitters, and hormones, play an important role (7Colucci-D'Amato L. Bonavita V. di Porzio U.

Hamblin M.H. Lee J.P. Neural stem cell transplantation and CNS diseases.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2016; 15: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, may play a role (10Malm T. Loppi S. Kanninen K.M. Exosomes in Alzheimer's disease.Neurochem. Int. 2016; 97: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Exosomes transmit information by carrying mRNA, miRNA, protein, and lipid between cells (11Cobelli N.J. Leong D.J. Sun H.B. Exosomes: biology, therapeutic potential, and emerging role in musculoskeletal repair and regeneration.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2017; 1410: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and possess the ability to regulate biological processes of receptor cells. They may play an important role in various stem cell microenvironments. The expression of exosomal miRNAs is dysregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (12Pegtel D.M. Peferoen L. Amor S. Extracellular vesicles as modulators of cell-to-cell communication in the healthy and diseased brain.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2014; 369: 20130516Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PTEN is an important tumor suppressor, and its expression in primary tumor cells is closely related to astrocyte-derived exosomes in the brain microenvironment (13Yang F. Ning Z. Ma L. Liu W. Shao C. Shu Y. Shen H. Exosomal miRNAs and miRNA dysregulation in cancer-associated fibroblasts.Mol. Cancer. 2017; 16: 148Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, exosomes are a major player in the intercellular communication network (14Gyorgy B. Szabo T.G. Pasztoi M. Pal Z. Misjak P. Aradi B. Laszlo V. Pallinger E. Pap E. Kittel A. Nagy G. Falus A. Buzas E.I. Membrane vesicles, current state-of-the-art: emerging role of extracellular vesicles.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 2667-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar), as they can facilitate cross talk between cells located in distant locations (15Korkut C. Li Y. Koles K. Brewer C.

Our previous studies have found that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after transection of the cholinergic innervation projecting from the basal forebrain to the hippocampus, which indicates that the denervated hippocampus provides an appropriate microenvironment for NSC survival and neuronal differentiation (16Zhu P. Li H. Jin G. Tian M. Tan X. Shi J. Zou L. Qin J. LIM-homeobox gene Lhx8 promote the differentiation of hippocampal newborn neurons into cholinergic neurons in vitro.In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol.

The denervated hippocampus provides proper microenvironment for the survival and differentiation of neural progenitors.Neurosci. Lett. 2007; 414: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This study examines exosomes released by neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia as well as gene transcriptome expression profiles in the hippocampal niche after FFT to identify the specific mechanism involved in the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal NSCs. Western blots showed expression of exosome marker molecules CD9, CD63, and Alix (Fig. 1A). Exosome samples were negatively stained by Teflon; transmission electron microscopy showed that the extracted vesicles have a typical “saucer-like” double-layer membrane structure approximately 100 nm in diameter, a classical exosome characteristic (Fig. 1B). ZETASIZER Nano series-Nano-ZS analysis showed an average vesicle size of 105.3 ± 6.2 nm. Main peak vesicle size was 146.5 nm. The vesicle distribution coefficient ranged between 0.08 and 0.7, indicating that the hippocampal niche excretes exosomes after FFT (Fig. 1, C–D). RNA sequencing of exosomes showed 24 differentially expressed miRNAs. Among these, 9 were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in the FFT group (Fig. 2, A–B). Gene ontology analysis showed that these differential miRNAs are mainly concentrated in biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, phosphorylation, and nervous system development (Fig. 2C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs in the denervated hippocampal niche were mainly enriched in pathways involved in the insulin signaling, Wnt signaling, and cGMP-PKG signaling pathways (Fig. 2D). A total of nine exosomal miRNAs in each group with log fold-changes ≥1.5 were selected to further validate the RNA sequencing results. Real-time PCR results revealed that miR-411-3p, miR-3559-3p, miR-6324, miR-1298, miR-15b-3p, miR-187-5p, miR-6319, and miR-339-5p were upregulated compared with the exosomes from the normal hippocampal niche (Fig. 2E). Unlike protein-coding genes, miRNAs sometimes exhibit tissue specificity for their particular role. We examined the expression of nine exosomal miRNA in tissue derived from ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm by real-time PCR. The results showed that, among these miRNAs, miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 were expressed greater in brain derived from ectoderm than other tissues and they were highly expressed in the hippocampus (Fig. 3, C–D). Thus, miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 were selected for further study. RNA of hippocampus niche exosomes was examined at 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after cholinergic denervation. Real-time PCR showed that the expression of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 gradually increased after denervation and was greatest at 7 days after FFT (Fig. 3, A–B). To verify the role of exosomes in neurogenesis in the deafferented hippocampal niche, the CM-Dil labeled exosomes were cocultured with hippocampal NSCs. After 24 h, the proportion of CM-Dil positive NSCs was 94.1% ± 2.4%, implying that the exosomes could be taken up by NSCs (Fig. 4A). Real-time PCR showed that the expression of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 in hippocampus NSCs cocultured with transected exosomes was higher than that in hippocampus NSCs cocultured with normal exosomes collected from normal hippocampus niche (Fig. 4, B–C). FCS showed that the proportion of hippocampus NSCs cocultured with transected exosomes in S phase was lower than that of hippocampus NSCs cocultured with normal exosomes (Fig. 4, D–F). In differentiation assay, the percentage of MAP-2 positive cells differentiated from hippocampus NSCs cocultured with transected exosomes was higher than that differentiated from hippocampus NSCs cocultured with transected exosomes (Fig. 4, G–H). Altogether, it suggests that exosomes from deafferented hippocampal niche could be taken up by hippocampal NSC promoting the expression of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 and inducing differentiation toward neurons. To explore the role of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 in the proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal NSCs, mimics and inhibitors were applied to transfected NSCs to alter expression. Real-time PCR was used to detect the overexpression and inhibition efficiency. miRNA corresponding to miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 mimics was highly expressed in NSCs (Fig. 5, A–D) (p < 0.001); miRNA corresponding to miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 inhibitors was inhibited in NSCs (Fig. 5, A–D) (p < 0.001). The expression level of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 in NSCs transfected with 1 nM miRNA mimics was similar to the expression pattern of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 in NSCs cocultured with transected exosomes, two to threefold to the normal group. Real-time PCR also showed that the expression level of the neuron-specific molecules MAP2, SYN1, NEUROD1, and STMN2 increased significantly when NSCs were transfected with 1 nM miRNA mimics for 24 h (Fig. 5, E and G); the expression of these four molecules decreased significantly when NSCs were transfected with 20 nM miRNA inhibitors for 24 h (Fig. 5, F and H). The EdU assay showed that the percentage of EdU-positive cells was lower in NSCs overexpressing miR-3559-3P group than the control group. The percentage of Ki67-positive cells was also lower in NSCs overexpressing miR-3559-3P group than the control group. In addition, the percentage of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was lower in the EdU-positive group than the control group; the percentage of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was also lower in the Ki67-positive group than the control group (Fig. 6, A–D). Immunofluorescence showed that the number of NSCs overexpressing miR-3559-3P was significantly higher in the MAP2-positive group than the control group. Western blots also showed that the expression of MAP2 was significantly upregulated in the group of NSCs overexpressing miR-3559-3P (Fig. 6, E and G) (p < 0.05 or 0.01). The percentage of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was lower in the EdU-positive group than the control group. The percentage of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was also lower in the Ki67-positive group than the control group. Immunofluorescence showed that the number of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was significantly higher in the MAP2-positive group than the control group. Western blots also showed that the expression of MAP2 was significantly upregulated in the group of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 (Fig. 6, F and H) (p < 0.05 or 0.01). The EdU assay showed that the percentage of NSCs with miR-3559-3P downregulated was higher in the EdU-positive group than the control group. The percentage of NSCs with miR-3559-3P downregulated was also higher in the Ki67-positive group than the control group. In addition, the percentage of NSCs with miR-6324 downregulated was higher in the EdU-positive group than the control group. The percentage of NSCs with miR-6324 downregulated was also higher in the Ki67-positive group than the control group (Fig. 7, A–D). Immunofluorescence showed that the number of cells with miR-3559-3P downregulated was significantly lower in the MAP2-positive group than the control group (Fig. 7, E and H). Western blots also showed that the expression of MAP2 protein was significantly downregulated in the group of NSCs with downregulated miR-3559-3P (Fig. 7, F and G) (p < 0.05 or 0.01). The percentage of NSCs with downregulated miR-6324 was higher in the EdU-positive group than the control group. The percentage of NSCs overexpressing miR-6324 was also lower in the Ki67-positive group than the control group. Immunofluorescence showed that the number of cells overexpressing miR-6324 was significantly higher in the MAP2-positive group than the control group. Western blots also showed that the expression of MAP2 protein was significantly upregulated in the group of NSCs with overexpressed miR-6324 (Fig. 7, E–H) (p < 0.05 or 0.01). To verify the effect of miRNAs in exosomes on proliferation and differentiation of cocultured NSCs, the loss-of-function assays were performed. The percentage of Tuj1 positive cell in differentiation assay was the highest when NSCs were cocultured with transected exosomes at ratio of 1:1000 (Fig. 8, A–B), and the proliferation ability of cocultured NSCs decreased significantly at ratio of 1:1000 (Fig. 8, C–D). In loss-of-function assay, the miRNAs in exosomes were inactivated by the treatment of Triton-X100 and RNase. The results showed that the percentage of TUJ1 positive cells in transected-Exo+RNase group was lower than that of transected-Exo group in differentiation assay (Fig. 8, E–F). In proliferation assay, flow cytometry revealed that there was no significant difference of the percentage of S phase cells in each group (Fig. 8, G–H), implying that transected exosomes have no effect on the proliferation state of cocultured NSC after inactivation of miRNAs in exosomes. Neural plasticity, the ability of the CNS to self-repair structure and function after damage strongly relies on neurogenesis (18Kim S.U. de Vellis J.

The SGZ of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus has the potential for neurogenesis throughout the entire adult period of life (20Zappulli V. Friis K.P. Fitzpatrick Z. Maguire C.A. Breakefield X.O.

Our previous study showed that the hippocampal niche dynamic changed after FFT. The exosome is a subtype of EV that possesses unique structural characteristics and biological functions. They can transfer mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, protein, and lipid between cells and are considered to be key messengers for short- and long-distance intracellular communication (12Pegtel D.M.

These exosomes can transmit messages between homologous or heterologous cells. In this study, we obtained EVs from the rat hippocampus niche using the method of Vella et al. (26Xin H. Wang F. Li Y.

Secondary release of exosomes from astrocytes contributes to the increase in neural plasticity and improvement of functional recovery after stroke in rats treated with exosomes harvested from MicroRNA 133b-overexpressing multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.Cell Transpl. 2017; 26: 243-257PubMed Google Scholar) Compared with the ultracentrifugation method, this method minimizes EV damage; however, the purity of the exosomes is slightly lower. Our results showed that the main peak particle size as measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis was slightly large (146.5 nm). The reason for this may be that the exosome diameter increased slightly after cryopreservation. There are four possible mechanisms of cell communication involving exosomes: 1) a ligand on the exosome membrane directly binds to the corresponding receptor on the surface of the target cell membrane to activate intracellular signal transduction (juxtacrine mode); 2) an exosomal membrane protein is first cleaved by a protease in the extracellular space and a cleaved polypeptide fragment acts as a ligand that binds to a receptor on the surface of the target cell membrane to stimulate a signal pathway; 3) the exosome fuses with the target cell membrane to release its molecules into the cell in a nonselective manner; 4) the exosome may play a role in the formation of target cell multivesicular bodies by endocytosis (27Li D.

In our study, a large number of CM-Dil labeled exosomes appeared in the cytoplasm of NSCs, suggesting that endocytosis may be the mechanism of entry into NSCs. Two exosomal miRNAs closely related to neurodevelopment, miR-3559-3P and miR-6324, were selected by RNA sequencing based on previous functional studies. Overexpression of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 in hippocampal NSCs promoted their differentiation into neurons while inhibiting their proliferation ability; in contrast, inhibition of miR-3559-3P and miR-6324 reduced differentiation into neurons. This result is consistent with previous studies that found the hippocampus niche is favorable for neurogenesis after denervation. Adult neurogenesis is a multistep process comprising activation of quiescent aNSCs, their differentiation into committed progenitor cells, neuronal survival, migration, and functional integration of newborn neurons. miRNAs are an integral part of the gene regulatory networks driving these changes. Pons-Espinal et al. (31Pons-Espinal M. de Luca E. Marzi M.J. Beckervordersandforth R. Armirotti A. Nicassio F. Fabel K. Kempermann G. De Pietri Tonelli D. Synergic functions of miRNAs determine neuronal fate of adult neural stem cells.Stem Cell Rep. 2017; 8: 1046-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) focused on a pool of 11 miRNAs (including miR-124 and miR-134) that was found to be highly upregulated during early neuronal differentiation and asked whether these miRNAs could rescue the bias toward astrocytic differentiation and the impaired neuronal differentiation of Dicer cKO aNSCs. However, some of the miRNA functions might be context-dependent. For instance, miR-9 was found to maintain quiescence of aNSCs in the zebrafish brain (32Katz S. Cussigh D. Urbán N. Blomfield I. Guillemot F. Bally-Cuif L. Coolen M. A nuclear role for miR-9 and argonaute proteins in balancing quiescent and activated neural stem cell states.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1383-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while in mouse aNSCs it promotes neuronal differentiation of aNSCs (33Zhao C.

Functional regulation of FoxO1 in neural stem cell differentiation.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22: 2034-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These divergent observations might be due to the different experimental model systems employed but may also reflect two different modes of action of miR-9, i.e., cytoplasmic miR-9 promotes neuronal differentiation via canonical targeting of Tlx and Foxo1 (33Zhao C. Sun G. Li S. Shi Y. A feedback regulatory loop involving microRNA-9 and nuclear receptor TLX in neural stem cell fate determination.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Another example of a miRNA eliciting context-dependent effects is miR-137, which was found to promote differentiation of embryonic NSCs (35Sun G.J. Zhou Y. Stadel R.P. Moss J. Yong J.H.A. Ito S. Kawasaki N.K. Phan A.T. Oh J.H. Modak N. Reed R.R. Toni N. Song H. Ming G.-L. Tangential migration of neuronal precursors of glutamatergic neurons in the adult mammalian brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Jin P. Cross talk between microRNA and epigenetic regulation in adult neurogenesis.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). miR-3559-3P and miR-3552 from adult neurogenic niche might also act in a context-dependent manner. Thus, elucidating the differences in miRNA-based regulation of murine versus human adult neurogenesis might eventually enable the promotion of adult neurogenesis in humans and their exploitation for regenerative purposes. There are still several issues to be further explored. We should clarify the mRNAs involved in regulation of NSC proliferation and differentiation that are targeted by miR-3559-3P and miR-6324. In addition, the relevant signaling pathway still needs to be elucidated, as well as the effect of these two miRNAs on NSC differentiation into neurons of specific phenotypes (such as cholinergic neurons). Clarifying these issues will provide clues and new ideas for uncovering the NSC differentiation mechanism and applying exosomes in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In total, 25 adult Sprague-Dawley rats (12 male and 13 female) and 8 E17 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. All animals were provided by the Experimental Animal Centre of Nantong University, China. Experimental procedures were conducted according to the Jiangsu Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize the number and suffering of animals used in the study. The rats were housed and caged at room temperature (23 °C ± 2 deg. C) in 12 h light/12 h dark cycle conditions in a facility where food and water were available. The rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (2 ml/kg) for FFT, which was performed with a wire knife at the CA1 layer of the dorsal hippocampus at the following coordinates based on the bregma: anteroposterior, 1.4 mm; lateral, 1 to 4 mm; depth, 5.6 mm. There was no restriction on the gender of the animals. The rat hippocampal tissue (denervated and untreated) was quickly harvested on ice. It was then digested with 0.125% trypsin at 37 °C for 30 min and the serum without exosomes was added to stop digestion. The Total Exosome Isolation Kit (from plasma) (Invitrogen, USA) was added to the supernatant after 4 °C, 3000g, 30 min centrifugation for an overnight stand. Then, after 4 °C, 10,000g, 1 h centrifugation, the precipitation was resuspended with 50 μl DPBS, and exosomes were harvested for the following experiments. Lysates of hippocampi and cells from each group were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for identification of exosome markers (CD9, CD63, and Alix) and neuron-specific molecules (MAP2 and Ki67). The membrane was blocked in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated with rabbit anti-CD9 (1:800 Abcam), rabbit anti-CD63 (1:800 Abcam), mouse anti-CD63 (1:1000 Abcam), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:800 Abcam), rabbit anti-Ki67(1:200 Abcam), and mouse anti-β-actin (1:10,000 Sigma) antibodies in TBST/5% BSA overnight. After washing, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with goat peroxidase-conjugated IgG diluted 1:5000 in TBST/5% BSA. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad). A 10 μl suspension of exosomes was diluted into a suitable concentration with DPBS. A drop of exosome suspension was placed on a copper net and allowed to stand for 5 min. Then, a drop of 1% dye solution of phosphotungstic acid was added. The copper net was dried under an infrared baking lamp for 10 min prior to sample examination with a transmission electron microscope. The exosomes from hippocampal niche were collected, pooled together, and lysed in Trizol reagent, and then total RNA was extracted. After evaluation of the RNA quality, the qualifified samples were submitted to a Sangon (China, Shanghai) for high-throughput sequencing.Samples with a high RNA integrity number (>8) were used for library construction. One hundred nanograms of total RNA was used for each sequencing library. All libraries were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. Two replicates of samples were sequenced. The differentially expressed genes were selected by the following criteria: fold change no less than 2, and FDR value less than 0.01. Pathway significant enrichment analysis was based on the KEGG Pathway Public database and found that the significant enrichment pathway among the differential expressed genes applied the hypergeometric test. With the pathway analysis results, we can identify the main biological process and signal transduction pathways that the differential expressed genes involved. The transfection of NSCs was carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). The miRNA mimics and inhibitors and negative control for transfection were synthesized by RiboBio (China, Guangzhou). The NSCs were transfected with a 1 nM miRNA mimics using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s instructions to simulate the expression pattern of miRNAs in NSCs after intaking the exosomes. The NSCs were transfected with a 20 nM miRNA inhibitors using Lipofectamine 3000 following the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection for 48 h, the expression levels of the selected lncRNAs were measured by qPCR. After 72 h, the cells were collected for cell proliferation assays and differentiation assay. Three rats in each group were used for real-time PCR for each experiment. Total extracted RNA was quantified and quality checked using the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA). Transcripts were reverse transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) at 65 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 72 °C for 5 min. The sequence of primers used for PCR gene amplification was as follows: Stmn2 sense 5′-CACTTGGAGACTGTGAGCTGGTT-3′ and antisense 5′-ATTGCCCTATGGGAATGAAA-3′; Neurod1 sense 5′-CAGGGTTATGAGATCGTCACTATTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCTTCTTGTCTGCCTCGTGTTCC-3′; Map2 sense 5′-CTTGATTCTATTGCCCTTGGGTTTA-3′ and antisense 5′-CATCCATCGTTCCGCTAGTGTTG-3′. Primers of miRNAs were designed and synthesized by RiboBio (Guangdong, China). The intellectual property rights of the primer sequence belong to Ribo biology, which were asked to be classified. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche, Germany). PCR reactions were performed at 95 °C for 40 s, 59 °C for 40 s, and repeated for 40 cycles. GAPDH and U6 were used as endogenous controls. Fold changes were calculated using the relative quantification 2−ΔΔCt method. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The harvested exosomes were labeled with celltracker CM-Dil following the manufacturer’s instruction (YEASEN, China). Then, the labeled exosomes were cocultured with 5 × 104 NSCs for 48 h. Positive NSCs were detected by the live cell station. NSC proliferation was measured using the EdU (5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyurdine) assay. Harvested NSCs were incubated in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube for 2 h at 37 °C and mixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice with 1 ml of PBS, NSCs were stained with Apollo 567 solution for 30 min at room temperature and Hoechst 33342 solution for 30 min and visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). The EdU incorporation rate was expressed as the ratio of EdU-positive cells (red cells) to total Hoechst 33342-positive cells (blue cells). Cell suspension with PBS was subjected to flow cytometry. Cells in a culture dish were trypsinized and collected, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in 1× Fix/Perm Buffer working solution at 4 °C for 40 min. After washing with 1× Perm/Wash Buffer, cell samples were mixed with 100 μl of 1× Perm/Wash Buffer and incubated with APC-conjugated anti-Tuj1 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h. Cell suspension was subjected to flow cytometry. In proliferation assay, cells were fixed overnight at 1 × 106 cells/ml in precooled 75% alcohol after dispersion with trypsin (Sigma) and filtration through a 40-μm cell strainer. Cells were then harvested and stained with Annexin V-fuorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (PI) (BD Biosciences, USA) for 30 min following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, USA). Data were analyzed using the CELL Quest 3.0 software. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Each experiment was confirmed using three independent biological replicates, unless otherwise specified. All analyzes were conducted using SPSS 19.0 statistical software (SPSS, IL, USA). Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. All are included in this article.

It is also known that the histone acetyltransferase p300 can induce PCK1 acetylation in cells, but whether that is a direct or indirect function was not known. Here we initially set out to determine whether p300 can acetylate directly PCK1 in vitro. We report that p300 weakly acetylates PCK1, but surprisingly, using several techniques including protein crystallization, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, saturation-transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular docking, we found that PCK1 is also able to acetylate itself using acetyl-CoA independently of p300. This reaction yielded an acetylated recombinant PCK1 with a 3-fold decrease in kcat without changes in Km for all substrates. Acetylation stoichiometry was determined for 14 residues, including residues lining the active site. Structural and kinetic analyses determined that site-directed acetylation of K244, located inside the active site, altered this site and rendered the enzyme inactive. In addition, we found that acetyl-CoA binding to the active site is specific and metal dependent. Our findings provide direct evidence for acetyl-CoA binding and chemical reaction with the active site of PCK1 and suggest a newly discovered regulatory mechanism of PCK1 during metabolic stress.

Although protein acetylation is facilitated by acetyltransferases, nonenzymatic acetylation has also been reported (9Tanner K.G. Langer M.R. Denu J.M.

Chemical acetylation has been associated with mitochondrial proteins and is favored under alkaline pH and high acetyl-CoA concentrations (13Wagner G.R. Payne R.M.

Chem. 2013; 288: 29036-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, a recent report indicated that nonenzymatic acetylation also occurs on cytosolic proteins (12Kulkarni R.A. Worth A.J. Zengeya T.T. Shrimp J.H. Garlick J.M. Roberts A.M. Montgomery D.C.

Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of oxaloacetic acid (OAA) into phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) providing metabolites for several metabolic pathways (14Yang J. Kalhan S.C. Hanson R.W. What is the metabolic role of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase?.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27025-27029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that PCK1 activity and stability are subject to a strong posttranslational control by acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination in response to cell energy input (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M.

Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate (PCK1) to perform its reverse reaction (from PEP to OAA) depends on its acetylation level on conserved residues close to the active site (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M.

Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Different acetyltransferases have been shown to modulate PCK1 acetylation in cells, including TIP60 (16Lin Y.-Y. Lu J.Y. Zhang J. Walter W. Dang W. Wan J. Tao S.C. Qian J. Zhao Y. Boeke J.D. Berger S.L. Zhu H. Protein acetylation microarray reveals that NuA4 controls key metabolic target regulating gluconeogenesis.Cell. 2009; 136: 1073-1084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and p300. p300 is a histone acetyltransferase that regulates gene expression in the nucleus (17Dancy B.M. Cole P.A. Protein lysine acetylation by p300/CBP.Chem. Rev. 2015; 115: 2419-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and has been suggested to directly acetylate PCK1 in cells (18Jiang W. Wang S. Xiao M. Lin Y. Zhou L. Lei Q. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. Zhao S. Acetylation regulates gluconeogenesis by promoting PEPCK1 degradation via recruiting the UBR5 ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated that TIP60 was unable to acetylate PCK1 in vitro (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M. Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the ability of p300 to directly acetylate PCK1 in vitro and the kinetic properties of the resulting acetylated enzyme were not determined. Unexpectedly, we found that purified PCK1 was only a weak substrate of p300 in vitro and that PCK1 alone reacted with acetyl-CoA, leading to an acetylated enzyme with significant loss of function. Here, we investigate the mechanism and molecular consequences of PCK1 self-acetylation. By applying several biophysical and biochemical approaches, we have found that acetyl-CoA promotes the self-acetylation of PCK1, which occurs in the absence of a lysine acetyltransferase. We demonstrate that residues inside the active site, including Lys244, are efficiently acetylated, disrupting enzyme activity at low concentrations of acetyl-CoA. The crystal structure of PCK1 acetylated at Lys244 showed that acetylation of the active site impedes the coordination of substrates and forms a hydrogen bond with Arg87, preventing the motility of an essential loop. The affinity of acetyl-CoA to the active site of PCK1 depends on the presence of divalent cations. In addition, NMR studies provided a landscape of the molecular interactions between PCK1 and acetyl-CoA. Overall, our results uncover a previously unknown ability of PCK1 to undergo self-acetylation, suggesting a possible regulatory mechanism under high acetyl-CoA levels. The control of PCK1 activity relies on the acetylation level on certain residues (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M. Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and p300 has been postulated as the major acetyltransferase catalyzing these events by directly binding PCK1 (18Jiang W. Wang S. Xiao M. Lin Y. Zhou L. Lei Q. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. Zhao S. Acetylation regulates gluconeogenesis by promoting PEPCK1 degradation via recruiting the UBR5 ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, the effects of direct acetylation of PCK1 by p300 on the kinetic properties of PCK1 have not been studied. To compare the kinetic properties of PCK1 between cell-mediated and in vitro p300-dependent acetylation, we set up experiments to acetylate recombinant rat PCK1 in the presence of recombinant human p300 and assess the level of acetylation by Western blot. After an 18-h incubation at 30 °C we observed that p300 was able to acetylate PCK1 (Fig. 1A). However, the controls associated with this experiment revealed that almost 25% of PCK1 was acetylated by acetyl-CoA alone when compared with PCK1 incubated in the presence of p300 and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1A). In fact, p300 inefficiently acetylated PCK1 (18 h) compared with a known substrate, histone H2A (19Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y. Overlapping but distinct patterns of histone acetylation by the human coactivators p300 and PCAF within nucleosomal substrates.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which was almost fully acetylated after 1 h under the same conditions (Fig. 1B). We also observed that PCK1 acetylated with acetyl-CoA alone or together with p300 had decreased activity (residual ∼30%) in both reactions under Vmax conditions compared with controls (Fig. 1C). These results imply that acetyl-CoA can react with PCK1 in the absence of an acetyltransferase (hereafter, referred to as nonenzymatic or chemical acetylation). We next sought to determine how enzyme-catalyzed and nonenzymatic acetylation affect the kinetic properties of PCK1. PCK1 was purified as a His-tagged protein and incubated at 30 °C for 18 h in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA with or without p300. Sodium acetate (NaAc) was included as a negative control to demonstrate that a stable acetyl group in solution cannot be transferred into the PCK1 either in an enzymatic or a nonenzymatic manner as discussed below. PCK1 was repurified using His-tag affinity columns (see Materials and Methods) before performing kinetic assays. As mentioned above (Fig. 1C), acetylation by acetyl-CoA alone yielded a 70% to 80% reduction in kcat for all substrates in both reaction directions, but no significant changes in Km were observed, except for CO2, which was reduced (1.5-fold) (Table S1). This reduction in kcat decreased the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by a factor of 5 to 6 in the gluconeogenic reaction (OAA→PEP) and by a factor of 2 to 3 in the reverse reaction (PEP→OAA). The p300-dependent acetylation also decreased kcat values for all substrates, and also changed Km for OAA (1.8-fold increase) and PEP (5-fold decrease). This treatment decreased the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the substrates OAA and GTP by a factor of 7, whereas the catalytic efficiency was slightly decreased (25%) for the substrates GDP and CO2, and for PEP, which was increased 2-fold. These results indicate that nonenzymatic acetylation decreases overall PCK1 activity without substantial changes in Km for all substrates, whereas p300-dependent acetylation changes Km values for OAA and PEP favoring the reverse reaction. Changes in Km for PCK1 substrates due to acetylation have been described in PCK1 purified from HEK293T cells (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M. Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No substantial differences were observed between control and NaAc treatment, indicating that the observed results were not just due to the presence of free acetate. Together, these data suggest that enzyme-catalyzed and nonenzymatic acetylation target distinct lysine residues on PCK1. Next, we investigated whether the observed chemical acetylation could be removed by the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1, which was shown to deacetylate and restore the basal kinetic properties of PCK1 (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M. Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although deacetylation (75%–90%) was possible (Fig. 1D), no activity recovery was observed (Fig. 1E), suggesting that those acetylated residues involved in the loss of PCK1 activity were not accessible or recognized by SIRT1. To determine if this nonenzymatic acetylation was specific for rat PCK1, we tested whether human PCK1 ortholog (Fig. S1) was acetylated in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Under the same experimental conditions, human PCK1 was also acetylated (Fig. 1F). Short incubations for 2 and 4 h in the presence of acetyl-CoA were performed (Fig. 1G), as overnight incubation with acetyl-CoA severely neutralized human PCK1 activity. Decreased (50%) enzyme activity was observed at 2 h, with negligible activity detected after 4 h (Fig. 1H). Owing to the known issues of the human protein being less stable than rat PCK1, the latter enzyme was used for further experiments. We then wondered whether CoA itself was able to inhibit PCK1 chemical acetylation or enzyme activity. First, we performed competition experiments using different concentrations of CoA (0–5 mM) in the presence of constant concentrations of acetyl-CoA (1 mM). Figure 1I shows that chemical acetylation of PCK1 is not prevented by the presence of CoA and only a slight inhibition is observed when using a 5-M excess of this compound. To exclude the possibility that PCK1 was inhibited by CoA, we determined PCK1 activity in both reaction directions in the presence of different CoA concentrations (Fig. 1J). Our results indicate that PCK1 activity is not modified by the presence of CoA, supporting chemical acetylation as the cause of altered PCK1 activity. Collectively, these results suggest that acetyl-CoA is capable of reacting with PCK1 via self-acetylation, leading to a substantial decrease in PCK1 catalysis. Incubation of PCK1 with 1 mM acetyl-CoA was sufficient to acetylate PCK1 and decrease activity by 70% in both forward and reverse reaction directions (Fig. 1). Next, we examined nonenzymatic acetylation kinetics of PCK1, revealing a linear increase in PCK1 acetylation that reached a maximum after 12 h (Fig. 2A). Concentrations of acetyl-CoA in the cytosol range from 6 to 13 μM in cultured LN229 cells under high glucose conditions (20Lee J.V. Carrer A. Shah S. Snyder N.W. Wei S. Venneti S. Worth A.J.

Judkins A. et al.Akt-dependent metabolic reprogramming regulates tumor cell histone acetylation.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 306-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Other reports highlight the great difference in acetyl-CoA concentrations between the cytosol (3–30 μM) and the mitochondrion (100–1500 μM) (13Wagner G.R. Payne R.M. Widespread and enzyme-independent N??-acetylation and N??-succinylation of proteins in the chemical conditions of the mitochondrial matrix.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 29036-29045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, and despite the low concentrations present in the cytosol, nonenzymatic acetylation of cytosolic proteins has been described (12Kulkarni R.A. Worth A.J. Zengeya T.T. Shrimp J.H. Garlick J.M. Roberts A.M. Montgomery D.C. Sourbier C. Gibbs B.K. Mesaros C. Tsai Y.C. Das S. Chan K.C. Zhou M.

Biol. 2017; 24: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore tested if nonenzymatic acetylation was possible under different low acetyl-CoA concentrations (5, 10, and 15 μM) at pH 7.4 and 30 °C for 8 h. Our results indicated that even under low acetyl-CoA concentrations PCK1 was nonenzymatically acetylated (Fig. 2B). To gain insight into the kinetics of lysine reactivity for acetylation, we utilized a previously reported method using LC-MS/MS to determine site-specific second-order rate constants (21Baeza J. Smallegan M.J. Denu J.M. Site-specific reactivity of nonenzymatic lysine acetylation.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Baeza J. Dowell J.A. Smallegan M.J. Fan J. Amador-Noguez D. Khan Z. Denu J.M. Stoichiometry of site-specific lysine acetylation in an entire proteome.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21326-21338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCK1 was incubated in the presence of acetyl-CoA to modify lysine residues as described above. Recombinant PCK1 was then denatured and chemically acetylated with D6-acetic anhydride, labeling all unmodified lysine residues with an isotopic acetyl group (D3-AcK), followed by trypsin digestion and high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify acetylation stoichiometry. PCK1 was incubated with various concentrations of acetyl-CoA (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mM) for 1 h. An aliquot of the reaction was sampled and processed for mass spectrometry to determine site-specific acetylation stoichiometry. The increase in stoichiometry of each peptide as a function of time yields a pseudo-first order rate (kobs). The second-order rate constant is determined by plotting the kobs as a function of acetyl-CoA concentration (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2). Acetylation stoichiometry was determined for 30 sites (71% of total PCK1 lysines) and the second-order rate constant was determined for 14 sites, including lysines 70, 71, 91, 107, 135, 204, 243, 244, 278, 290, 316, 342, 349, and 353 (Fig. 2C, Table S2). The highest acetylation stoichiometry was determined for peptides containing K70/K71, K342/K349/K353, and K243/K244, with a second-order rate constant above 20 × 10−5 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 2C). Among peptides containing a single acetylated lysine, K204 and K71 exhibited the highest reactivity with second-order rate constants of 14.7 × 10−5 and 14.6 × 10−5 M−1 s−1, respectively. The lowest reactivity was detected for K316, K135, and the peptide containing lysines 278 and 290 with second-order rates of 3.8 × 10−5, 4.8 × 10−5, and 5.9 × 10−5 M−1 s−1, respectively. Analysis of the crystal structure of PCK1 revealed that chemically acetylated lysines were not localized in a specific region of the enzyme (Fig. 2D), but interestingly, we found acetylation of two lysines inside the active site, K244 and K290 (Fig. 2E), with essential catalytic functions (23Carlson G.M. Holyoak T. Structural insights into the mechanism of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27037-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To analyze the consequences of acetylation of these sites on the kinetic properties of PCK1, we used a previously described method (24Yu W. Dittenhafer-Reed K.E. Denu J.M. SIRT3 protein deacetylates isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and regulates mitochondrial redox status.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 14078-14086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) to generate site-specific acetylated PCK1 variants at positions 244 (K244AcK) and 290 (K290AcK) in Escherichia coli ΔCobB (22Baeza J. Dowell J.A. Smallegan M.J. Fan J. Amador-Noguez D. Khan Z. Denu J.M. Stoichiometry of site-specific lysine acetylation in an entire proteome.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 21326-21338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This methodology is based on the presence of an aminoacyl-tRNACUA synthetase that incorporates site-specific acetyl-lysines at desired positions encoded by the amber codon (UAG) (Fig. 2F). In both cases, acetylation of either K244 or K290 resulted in an enzyme with residual activity (≤1% of controls) under saturated substrate conditions (Fig. 2G). In the gluconeogenic reaction (OAA→PEP), PCK1 WT, K244AcK, and K290AcK showed an activity of 32 ± 2, 0.46 ± 0.13, and 0.3 ± 0.07 μmol/min/mg, respectively, whereas in the reverse reaction (PEP→OAA) the same enzymes exhibited an activity of 17 ± 2, 0.15 ± 0.04, and 0.23 ± 0.02 μmol/min/mg, respectively. Of note, we observed that the anti-acetyl-lysine antibody used displayed different sensitivity to acetylated targets. As seen in Figure S3, the sensitivity toward K244AcK is considerably lower than for K91AcK (15Latorre-Muro P. Baeza J. Armstrong E.A. Hurtado-Guerrero R. Corzana F. Wu L.E. Sinclair D.A. López-Buesa P. Carrodeguas J.A. Denu J.M. Dynamic acetylation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase toggles enzyme activity between gluconeogenic and anaplerotic reactions.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 718-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that acetylation of K244 can be more extensive than suggested in Western blots (Fig. 1A), and therefore explaining why recovery of activity does not apparently correlate with deacetylation by SIRT1 (Fig. 1D). The high acetylation observed for K244 by mass spectrometry supports this view. Together, these observations indicate that lysines in PCK1 react differently to acetyl-CoA in vitro and even under cell physiological acetyl-CoA concentrations. Moreover, acetyl-CoA can react with lysines from the active site, leading to PCK1 inactivation. Given the ability of acetyl-CoA to directly react with lysines inside the active site of PCK1, we wondered whether acetylation was affected when PCK1 was incubated with 1 mM acetyl-CoA plus one of its specific substrates (OAA, GTP, PEP, or GDP) at 1 mM final concentration. Incubation in the presence of these substrates partially prevented acetylation compared with controls (incubated in the presence of only acetyl-CoA). However, each substrate prevented chemical acetylation at a different level. Substrates in the gluconeogenic reaction (OAA and GTP) prevented 90% of acetylation, whereas substrates in the reverse reaction (PEP and GDP) prevented 50% of chemical acetylation (Fig. 3A). To test if this inhibition was substrate specific, we repeated the experiment using similar chemicals not related to PCK1 catalysis. Apart from the aforementioned PCK1 substrates, we tested other nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP), pyruvate, and 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (3-MPA, a PCK1 inhibitor). We also considered the use of metals such as Mn2+ and Mg2+ that are essential for PCK1 catalysis. Apart from PCK1 specific substrates, none of the other chemicals prevented PCK1 chemical acetylation (Fig. 3B) suggesting a possible competitive mechanism between acetyl-CoA and PCK1 substrates. PCK1 catalysis relies on the presence of metals (Mn2+ and Mg2+) for the correct coordination of substrates (23Carlson G.M. Holyoak T. Structural insights into the mechanism of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27037-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although no differences were seen when these metals were used to prevent acetylation during overnight incubation (Fig. 3B), we tested if the interaction was modulated in their presence. To do so, a time-course experiment was performed incubating PCK1 in the presence of 1 mM acetyl-CoA and in the absence or in the presence of 1 mM of each metal. We observed that after 6 h the presence of MnCl2 enhanced PCK1 chemical acetylation by a factor of 1.3 and that the presence of MgCl2 decreased the acetylation rate by a factor of 3 compared with positive controls (Fig. 3C). In addition, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays confirmed that the presence of either 0.1 or 1 mM Mn2+ facilitated the interaction between PCK1 and acetyl-CoA (Fig. 3D). In fact, Kd for acetyl-CoA decreased by a factor of 100 (110 versus 0.9 μM) in the presence of 0.1 mM Mn2+ and by a factor of 9 in the presence of 1 mM Mn2+ (110 versus 13 μM). For further experiments, 0.1 mM Mn2+ was added to reaction mixtures. Our results indicate that the presence of Mn2+ mediates the interaction of acetyl-CoA and PCK1, promoting a better binding for optimal self-acetylation and enzyme inactivation. To gain insight into the consequences of acetylation on K244 and the mechanism of chemical acetylation we crystalized the PCK1 K244AcK variant and PCK1 WT in the presence of acetyl-CoA. However, we were unable to obtain a complex between PCK1 and acetyl-CoA. On the contrary, we were successful in obtaining the crystal structure of PCK1 K244AcK (Table S3). The structure showed that acetylation on K244 prevents the coordination of Mn2+ with this residue, but interestingly the acetyl group of K244 establishes a hydrogen bond with Arg87 in the R-loop, which is essential for catalysis (23Carlson G.M. Holyoak T. Structural insights into the mechanism of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase catalysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27037-27041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that acetylation on K244 affects the Mn2+ coordination and also the interaction and synchronization of two essential loops for PCK1 catalysis, leading to PCK1 inactivation. Since crystallization of PCK1 with acetyl-CoA did not produce the expected results, in order to gain insight into the details of the interaction between acetyl-CoA and PCK1, we used saturation-transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy to study the binding of acetyl-CoA and coenzyme A (CoA) to PCK1 in solution (25Mayer M. Meyer B. Characterization of ligand binding by saturation transfer difference NMR spectroscopy.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 12: 1784-1788Crossref Scopus (1237) Google"

Carnitine is a vitamin-like compound cardinal in the translocation of mid- and long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix, where the fatty acid β-oxidation takes place (1Longo N.

An important experimental model for the comprehension of the role of carnitine in cell metabolism has been and still is the juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mouse. Jvs pups are characterized by systemic carnitine deficiency, hepatic steatosis, hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia, and growth retardation (3Koizumi T. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Nonomura A. Yoneda T.

Primary systemic carnitine deficiency in both human and rodents is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SLC22A5/Slc22a5 gene encoding for the carnitine/organic cation transporter novel 2 (OCTN2).

Because of the fine-tuned interaction between transmembrane proteins and the surrounding lipid microenvironment, we hypothesized that the accumulation of lipids in the plasma membrane might as well promote L-carnitine uptake mediated by OCTN2. In particular, plasma membrane cholesterol has been extensively associated with transmembrane protein function (27Ringerike T. Blystad F.D. Levy F.O. Madshus I.H. Stang E.

Cholesterol seems also to bind to transmembrane protein domains known as Cholesterol Recognition/interaction Amino acid Consensus sequences (CRAC and CARC) (37Fantini J. Barrantes F.J.

Physiol. 2013; 4: 31Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work is to outline the effects of cholesterol on OCTN2-mediated L-carnitine transport employing intact cells overexpressing the human OCTN2 and proteoliposomes harboring the native OCTN2 extracted from OCTN2-HEK293 cells. As previously shown, short exposure to methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβcd) allows selective scavenging of cholesterol from cells (38Hormann S. Gai Z. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Visentin M. Plasma membrane cholesterol regulates the allosteric binding of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium to organic cation transporter 2 (SLC22A2).J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2020; 372: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably transfected with the coding sequence of the human OCTN2 (Fig. 1A) and Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh-7) cells transiently transfected with the human OCTN2 (Fig. 1B) exposed for 20 min to mβcd were characterized by an ∼50% depletion of total cholesterol in comparison with the untreated cells. The impact of cholesterol removal on OCTN2 function was evaluated by assessing the L-carnitine uptake at the nonsaturating extracellular concentration of 0.5 μM in the presence or absence of Na+ over 15 s, an interval in which the transport of L-carnitine is linear, reflecting the unidirectional flux of the substrate into the cells (12Visentin M. Gai Z. Torozi A. Hiller C. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Colistin is substrate of the carnitine/organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2, SLC22A5).Drug Metab. Dispos. 2017; 45: 1240-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1C, the 20-min preincubation with mβcd significantly reduced the Na+-dependent influx of L-carnitine (0.002 ± 0.001 versus 0.006 ± 0.003 pmol/μg of protein, p = 0.02) in OCTN2-HEK293 cells. In a similar fashion, in OCTN2-Huh-7 cells, the mβcd preincubation reduced the uptake of L-carnitine by ∼50% as compared with that in untreated OCTN2-Huh-7 cells (0.00018 ± 0.00004 versus 0.00031 ± 0.00007 pmol/μg of protein, p = 0.05) (Fig. 1D). A possible direct inhibitory effect of mβcd on L-carnitine OCTN2-mediated transport was ruled out by measuring L-carnitine uptake in the presence of mβcd at the extracellular concentration of 2.5 mM in OCTN2-HEK293 cells. It can be seen that mβcd did not directly interfere with the L-carnitine-OCTN2 interaction (0.006 ± 0.003 versus 0.007 ± 0.002 pmol/μg of protein, p = NS) (Fig. 1E). Because of the relatively low transport rate of L-carnitine measured in OCTN2-Huh-7 cells, thus the low signal-to-noise ratio, the nature of the OCTN2-cholesterol interaction was further investigated exclusively in OCTN2-HEK293 cells. The inhibitory effect of cholesterol depletion L-carnitine uptake mediated by OCTN2 was observed also in OCTN2-HEK293 cells exposed to atorvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis (Fig. S1). Surface labeling coupled to Western blotting was employed to assess the OCTN2 expression level in OCTN2-HEK293 cells upon exposure to mβcd. As shown in Figure 2A, the plasma membrane OCTN2 protein level was comparable in control and mβcd-treated cells. Cholesterol distribution in the membrane is heterogeneous, concentrating in cholesterol-rich and sphingomyelin-rich membrane domains (membrane rafts). Several studies have shown that cholesterol depletion results in the spatial reorganization of membrane proteins because of the shattering of the cholesterol-enriched domains (39Zidovetzki R. Levitan I. Use of cyclodextrins to manipulate plasma membrane cholesterol content: evidence, misconceptions and control strategies.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 1311-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in rat astrocytes demonstrated that plasma membrane Octn2 localizes primarily in lipid rafts, where it directly interacts with caveolin-1, a membrane protein enriched in lipid rafts (40Czeredys M. Samluk L. Michalec K. Tulodziecka K. Skowronek K. Nalecz K.A. Caveolin-1--a novel interacting partner of organic cation/carnitine transporter (Octn2): effect of protein kinase C on this interaction in rat astrocytes.PLoS One. 2013; 8e82105Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In order to examine whether OCTN2 localized in membrane rafts and to what extent OCTN2 membrane localization was affected by the treatment with mβcd, the surface expression level of OCTN2 was assessed in the raft (insoluble) and nonraft (soluble) fractions of OCTN2-HEK293 cells. Figure 2B shows that, upon cholesterol depletion, there was a significant disruption of the raft fraction, as shown by the redistribution of CAVEOLIN-1 and FLOTILLIN-1 from the insoluble (rafts) to the soluble fraction (nonrafts). Moreover, it can be seen that both Na+/K+ ATPase, a known nonraft marker (41Nunez E. Alonso-Torres P. Fornes A. Aragon C. Lopez-Corcuera B. The neuronal glycine transporter GLYT2 associates with membrane rafts: functional modulation by lipid environment.J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 2080-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and OCTN2, were almost exclusively detected in the soluble fraction (nonrafts), suggesting that OCTN2 did not cluster in the lipid rafts. Plasma membrane leaking and/or the inhibition of the Na+/K+ ATPase might as well contribute to the reduced uptake of L-carnitine observed upon preincubation to mβcd (7Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. Molecular and functional identification of sodium ion-dependent, high affinity human carnitine transporter OCTN2.J. Biol.

J. 1999; 76: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To assess the plasma membrane integrity, OCTN2-HEK293 cells were exposed for 20 min to mβcd and then mixed with the Trypan blue solution for cell counting. Figure 3A shows that the fractions of control and mβcd-treated cells impermeable to Trypan blue were comparable, indicating that mβcd preincubation did not alter the plasma membrane integrity. The activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase is critical to sustain the Na+ inward gradient, hence to the L-carnitine OCTN2-mediated transport. A reduction in the Na+/K+ ATPase activity or an outward leaking of Na+ would result in a reduced Na+ inward gradient and, in turn, in membrane potential depolarization. As chloride distribution has been shown to correlate well with the cell membrane potential (43Nobes C.D.

Measurement of intracellular chloride activity in mouse liver slices with microelectrodes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 903: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the impact of mβcd preincubation on plasma membrane potential was assessed by monitoring the distribution of chloride ions across the plasma membrane. Figure 3B shows that, at equilibrium, the intracellular level of chloride ions was increased by a 20-min exposure to ouabain, which inhibits the Na+/K+ ATPase, causing the partial depolarization of the plasma membrane (p = 0.018). Conversely, the preincubation with mβcd slightly, albeit significantly, hyperpolarized the plasma membrane as reflected by the lower intracellular chloride ion concentration (p = 0.049). To assess whether the effect of mβcd on OCTN2-mediated L-carnitine influx was cholesterol dependent, “cholesterol-matched” experiments were performed. It can be seen that OCTN2-HEK293 cells exposed for 20 min to varying ratios of empty mβcd:cholesterol-saturated mβcd (RAMEB) mixtures showed similar total cholesterol content to that of control cells (Fig. 4A). The 3:1 mβcd:RAMEB ratio was used for assessing L-carnitine transport. OCTN2-mediated L-carnitine influx after preincubation with mβcd:RAMEB (3:1) was comparable with that in control cells (0.009 ± 0.002 versus 0.007 ± 0.002 pmol/μg of protein, p = NS), indicating that the mβcd effect on OCTN2-mediated L-carnitine transport is cholesterol dependent (Fig. 4B). The study of the effect of cholesterol on OCTN2 activity in intact cells was limited by the resistance of the OCTN2-HEK293 cells to cholesterol overloading (Fig. 4A) and by the deleterious effect of more extensive cholesterol depletion, which is likely to jeopardize cell viability. Hence, to better characterize the dependence of OCTN2 transport activity on cholesterol content, OCTN2 protein was extracted from OCTN2-HEK293 cells and reconstituted in egg yolk phospholipid-liposomes. Figure 5A, which illustrates the uptake of L-carnitine in the presence of increasing concentration of Na+, demonstrates that the proteoliposomes harboring OCTN2 were functional. In line with the results obtained in intact cells, the transport of L-carnitine was stimulated by the incorporation of exogenous cholesterol and such effect appeared to be dose dependent (Fig. 5B). Finally, the transport of L-carnitine was stimulated by a potassium diffusion membrane potential induced in the presence of valinomycin (Fig. 5C). Taken together, the data indicate that cholesterol stimulated OCTN2 transport activity in proteoliposomes as well and that the stimulatory effect on L-carnitine uptake was the result of the interaction with the OCTN2 protein and not a secondary effect of the Na+/K+ pump. To understand the nature of cholesterol-dependent stimulation of OCTN2-mediated L-carnitine transport, the influx kinetics of L-carnitine was measured in OCTN2-HEK293 cells after 20-min preincubation with mβcd at the extracellular concentration of 2.5 mM. Cholesterol depletion increased the Km of OCTN2 for L-carnitine (19.9 ± 7.79 versus 76.9 ± 26.5 μM, p = 0.02) with a slight, albeit significant, stimulation of the maximal capacity of the transport (0.63 ± 0.13 versus 0.92 ± 0.12 pmol/μg of protein/min, p = 0.04) (Fig. 6A). Although the kinetic values obtained from the Hanes–Woolf transformation (Fig. 6B) were comparable with those calculated from the hyperbola derived from the Michaelis–Menten equation, it is noteworthy that, in the latter, the influx Km for L-carnitine upon treatment with mβcd might be overestimated as saturation of the transport reaction could not be reached. Kinetic parameters of L-carnitine transport mediated by OCTN2 are summarized in Table 1. To understand whether the maximal capacity augmentation upon cholesterol depletion was because of an increased affinity for the Na+, L-carnitine influx was measured at increasing extracellular concentrations of Na+. Figure 6C shows that the regression lines of the L-carnitine influx as a function of the extracellular concentration of Na+ in control and mβcd-treated cells nearly intersected on the x-axis, indicating comparable Km for the Na+ (3.60 ± 0.26 versus 5.13 ± 0.70 mM, p = NS). Kinetic analysis in proteoliposomes showed that, upon cholesterol insertion the Vmax increased in a dose-dependent manner with no changes in the affinity toward L-carnitine. The Vmax of L-carnitine influx in the presence of 25% cholesterol (25 μg cholesterol/mg of lipids) was higher than that in control proteoliposomes (6.15 ± 1.34 versus 2.47 ± 0.3 pmol/μg of protein/min, p = 0.0003) (Fig. 7, A–B, Table 1). To understand whether the effect of cholesterol insertion on the Vmax was secondary to a change in the affinity for the binding of Na+ to OCTN2, the influx of L-carnitine was measured in reconstituted proteoliposomes titrating the concentration of Na+ in the transport buffer. It can be seen that in cholesterol-loaded proteoliposomes the affinity for Na+ was ∼4 times stronger than that in control proteoliposomes (p = 0.03), suggesting that the cholesterol loading did change the affinity of OCTN2 for the Na+ (Fig. 7C).Table 1Kinetic parameters of L-carnitine transport rate mediated by OCTN2AnalysisTreatmentKmp-valueVmaxp-valueIntact cells Michaelis–MentenControl19.9 ± 7.790.020.63 ± 0.130.042.5 mM mβcd76.9 ± 26.50.92 ± 0.12 Hanes–WoolfControl17.3 ± 4.240.0030.62 ± 0.14NS2.5 mM mβcd53.3 ± 8.310.78 ± 0.23Proteoliposomes Michaelis–MentenControl115 ± 38.3NS2.47 ± 0.300.000325% Cholesterol108 ± 48.36.15 ± 1"

In addition to collagen P4Hs and hypoxia-inducible factor P4Hs, a third P4H—the poorly characterized endoplasmic reticulum–localized transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H-TM)—is found in animals. P4H-TM variants are associated with the familiar neurological HIDEA syndrome, but how these variants might contribute to disease is unknown. Here, we explored this question in a structural and functional analysis of soluble human P4H-TM. The crystal structure revealed an EF domain with two Ca2+-binding motifs inserted within the catalytic domain. A substrate-binding groove was formed between the EF domain and the conserved core of the catalytic domain. The proximity of the EF domain to the active site suggests that Ca2+ binding is relevant to the catalytic activity. Functional analysis demonstrated that Ca2+-binding affinity of P4H-TM is within the range of physiological Ca2+ concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum. P4H-TM was found both as a monomer and a dimer in the solution, but the monomer–dimer equilibrium was not regulated by Ca2+. The catalytic site contained bound Fe2+ and N-oxalylglycine, which is an analogue of the cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate. Comparison with homologous P4H structures complexed with peptide substrates showed that the substrate-interacting residues and the lid structure that folds over the substrate are conserved in P4H-TM, whereas the extensive loop structures that surround the substrate-binding groove, generating a negative surface potential, are different. Analysis of the structure suggests that the HIDEA variants cause loss of P4H-TM function. In conclusion, P4H-TM shares key structural elements with other P4Hs while having a unique EF domain.

Eukaryotic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) are enzymes that catalyze the post-translational hydroxylation of peptidyl–proline residues to 4-hydroxyproline (Fig. 1A). All known P4Hs belong to the same enzyme superfamily of iron and 2-oxoglutarate–dependent dioxygenases (2OGDDs). 2OGDDs are defined by the double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold of the catalytic domain, the shared mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and the common cofactors, Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and molecular oxygen, and vitamin C, which is not a direct cofactor but supports the catalysis (Fig. 1A) (4McDonough M.A. Loenarz C.

Although previous results show that P4H-TM hydroxylates HIF1α and it has been considered to be the fourth HIF-P4H, the catalytic activity was only detected toward the 200-residue oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODDD) of HIF1α, not toward shorter peptides harboring the prolines whose hydroxylated forms are recognized by the von Hippel–Lindau protein (13Koivunen P.

Furthermore, P4H-TM also hydroxylated to a small extent HIF1α ODDD in which the HIF-P4H–targeted prolines were mutated to alanines. In addition, the behavioral phenotype of the P4H-TM KO mice is very different from any other HIF-P4H KO mice (20Leinonen H. Koivisto H. Lipponen H.-R. Matilainen A. Salo A.M. Dimova E.Y.

P4H-TM contains a putative EF domain with calcium-binding EF-hand motifs not found in any other characterized 2OGDD superfamily enzyme. The significance of this domain for P4H-TM function, the potential connection of calcium storing/sensing to HIF1α regulation, and the relevance of P4H-TM localization inside the ER are not known. To shed light on the function of P4H-TM, we solved the crystal and solution structures of the protein, analyzed the structures, and used them to predict the effect of the HIDEA variants on the structure and function within the cellular context and in relation to the calcium concentration. The structure of the soluble part of human P4H-TM was solved with X-ray crystallography in the presence of Fe2+, N-oxalylglycine (NOG), and Ca2+. The crystallized construct consists of residues 88 to 502 of P4H-TM and an N-terminal His-tag, whereas it lacks the short cytoplasmic region and the transmembrane helix (Fig. 1). The crystal structure shows that the P4H-TM fold is composed of two well-defined domains: the catalytic domain with the DSBH fold and the EF domain. The EF domain is inserted just before the core domain of the DSBH fold (Fig. 3, A and C). There are two P4H-TM molecules in the asymmetric unit. These two molecules are related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis (Fig. 3B). The PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) analyses identified four buried salt bridges: Arg318-Glu270, Arg402-Glu321, Glu270-Arg318, and Glu321-Arg402. There is a fifth and sixth possible (almost buried) salt bridge between Glu267-His276 and His276-Glu267. The latter two interactions are between the EF hands (residues 190–290). The protein–protein interface between the two molecules is extensive, 1400 Å2. This interface is rather polar, and PISA calculations using only the protein–protein interactions predict that these two molecules are not forming a stable dimer in the solution (the complexation significance score is zero). Overall, the P4H-TM structure contains 12 β-strands and nine α-helices. The conserved DSBH core is composed of eight antiparallel β-strands that are divided into two sheets that fold against each other. The core DSBH strands are conventionally numbered with roman numerals from I to VIII (Fig. 3A). Two of the core strands of the DSBH minor sheet are heavily disrupted in P4H-TM and do not observe the β-sheet geometry, but the nomenclature is preserved for clarity. The two P4H-TM molecules of the asymmetric unit occupy very similar conformations (RMSD 0.42 Å for all Cα-atoms), and only chain A is discussed unless otherwise stated. The first visible P4H-TM residues are Thr107 and Leu108 in chains A and B, respectively. Including the 6xHis tag, there are 25 disordered residues in the N-terminus that are not visible in the electron density. The visible N-terminus is positioned along the protein surface between helices α7 and α8 and the βVI–βVII loop without a defined secondary structure. Starting at Gly120, the protein forms three consecutive antiparallel β-strands (β1–3) that extend the DSBH major sheet off of βVI, with β3 running antiparallel to βVI. After β3, the first helix α1 is positioned behind the major sheet. α1 is followed by a long and partially disordered loop α1-α2 that reaches the EF domain. The first of the two EF hands is formed by α2, a calcium-binding loop α2-α3, and α3. α3 ends abruptly after six residues and is followed by a 310 helix and the α3-α4 loop between the two EF hands. The second EF hand is formed by helices α4 and α5 and the calcium-binding loop α4-α5 in between them. The six-residue α5 is followed, after a turn, by the longer α6. The loop α6-β4 runs antiparallel to the α1-α2 loop back toward the catalytic domain and forms a two-residue β-like extension to the DSBH minor sheet. β4 extends the DSBH major sheet to the opposite direction to the strands 1 to 3. It is followed by two helices, α7 and short α8, that run antiparallel to each other and lead into the first β strand of the DSBH core. βI is located between β4 and βVIII in the DSBH major sheet. βII folds over βI, but its conformation is disrupted by the iron-binding residues and the disulfide in the neighboring βVII strand. βII leads to an extended 30-residue loop βII-βIII, which contains an internal disulfide between Cys340 and Cys357. The disulfide bridge appears to tether the middle part of the loop to the beginning of βIII. βIII is part of the major sheet between βVI and βVIII. Subsequently, βIV folds over it, positioned between βV and βVII, and leads to a 30-residue βIV-βV loop that harbors two 310 helices and forms several contacts with the EF domain. A disulfide is formed between Cys404 near the end of the βIV-βV loop and Cys444 at the end of βVII. This linkage seems to function as an anchor to determine the position of this large loop. After the loop, βV forms one end of the minor sheet and is positioned antiparallel to the neighboring βIV. A short turn after βV leads to βVI positioned between β3 and βIII. The following loop, βVI-βVII, twists around itself in an extended hairpin-like structure and leads to βVII after a short 310 helix. βVII completes the minor sheet between βII and βIV and is followed by the final major sheet strand βVIII. A short, coiled region after βVIII leads to the terminal helix α9. The last visible residue in the structure is Gly481 at the end of α9, only 25 Å away from the visible N-terminus. The last 21 residues of P4H-TM are not visible in the electron density. Prediction of glycosylation sites within P4H-TM resulted in three potential sites of which two, Asn368 and Asn382, reached the threshold, whereas the third site, Asn348, was just below it. In the structure, Asn368 and Asn382 were found to be glycosylated, whereas Asn348 is located in a part of the βII-βIII loop where the electron density for the side chain was not well defined. Asn368 is in the short βIII-βIV loop and two N-acetylglucosamine residues could be modeled to be attached to it with clear electron density. Eight mannose residues were modeled to the Asn382-linked glycan in the βIV-βV in addition to the two N-acetylglucosamines. A suggested alternative isoform 3 of P4H-TM (UniProt: Q9NXG6-3) to isoform 1 (UniProt: Q9NXG6-1) contains a 61-residue insertion after Arg358 and appears in some sequence databases as the canonical form of the enzyme (Fig. S1). We expressed isoform 3 with a similar insect cell expression vector used for the isoform 1 lacking the cytosolic part and the transmembrane domain but did not obtain soluble protein for characterization (data not shown). The P4H-TM structure indicates that an insertion at this position would either displace Arg358 and triple the length of the βII-βIII loop or alternatively completely displace the βIII and βIV strands. The P4H-TM structure contains an EF domain with two EF hands between residues 190 and 251 (Fig. 4A). Calcium is coordinated in a pentagonal bipyramid conformation by seven oxygen ligands from residues listed in Table 1. The Ca2+-coordinating residues are notated based on their geometrical position: X and -X form the tips of the bipyramid and Y, -Y, Z, and the bidentate -Z occupy the vertices of the pentagonal plane. The initial Ca2+-binding residue Asp198 in the first EF hand emerges directly from α2. The -Y position of the first EF hand is provided by the main chain carbonyl of His204 while Glu209 links α3 to the Ca2+ with bidentate binding. Unusually, the initial Ca2+-binding residue of the second EF hand, Asp237, does not emerge from α4 directly, but after a linker residue. This displacement could influence the relative movement by α4 and α5 in the event of Ca2+ dissociation. The coordinating oxygen in the -X position of the second EF hand is provided by a water molecule in chain A. No electron density for a corresponding water molecule was visible in chain B. The main chain carbonyl oxygen of Val243 provides ligand position -Y, and Glu248 from α5 binds Ca2+ in a bidentate manner.Table 1EF-domain Ca2+-coordinating residues of P4H-TMPositionEF 1EF 2XAsp198Asp237YAsn200Asp239ZAsp202Asp241−XGln206Water 33−YHis204Val243−ZGlu209Glu248P4H-TM, transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase.

The overall Ca2+-binding affinity of P4H-TM was measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and the corresponding Kd was 23 μM (Table 2) (Fig. 4B). The modeling used assumes that the two binding sites are identical and independent. The obtained data fit well to this model, and the stoichiometry is accurate. The results suggest that calcium binding to P4H-TM is enthalpy-driven as the negative ΔH term is nearly nine times larger than the slightly positive entropy term –TΔS (Table 2).Table 2Isothermal titration calorimetry results of P4H-TMN2.02 ± 0.039 sitesKa42,700 ± 5030 M−1Kd23 μMaCalculated from Ka.ΔH−7142 ± 186.6 cal mol−1ΔS−2.77 cal mol−1 deg−1Ka, Ca2+ binding constant; ΔH, enthalpy change; P4H-TM, transmembrane prolyl 4-hydroxylase; N, molar ratio of Ca2+ binding; ΔS, entropy of binding.a Calculated from Ka.

CD measurements were used to clarify the structural changes that occur during calcium binding to P4H-TM. Far-UV synchrotron radiation CD measurements did not show a notable change in the secondary structure composition of P4H-TM with the addition of calcium (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the near-UV CD revealed a large shift in the CD signal in the tryptophan region between wavelengths 285 nm and 305 nm when calcium was added to metal-free P4H-TM (Fig. 4D). No shift was induced when magnesium was added to metal-free P4H-TM (Fig. 4D). This signal probably arises when the calcium-dependent conformational change shifts the positions of Trp220 and Trp221 located in the α4-α5 loop b"

https://openalex.org/W3112540185,"The 30th of July 2020 marked the centenary of the birth of a woman who was central to the development of the field of Earth sciences: Marie Tharp, a pioneer of ocean floor cartography and marine geology. Her work was crucial in reintroducing a mobilist (drift) vision of Earth and for the development of the plate tectonics revolution in the early 1960s.

The theory of continental drift proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912—which was based on sound correspondences between rocks, fossils, and geological structures on opposite sides of the Atlantic—was initially heavily criticized and rejected by the scientific community. Some paleontologists invoked the past presence of continental bridges that subsequently collapsed to explain the similarity of the faunas between the two sides of the ocean. The hardest attack came from the field of geophysics, which perceived the biggest obstacles to be the identification of a possible “driving force” or “engine” that could move rigid crust, causing such prodigious continental drift. However, Wegener, by combining geological data that included isostasy and the evidence of radiogenic heat, proposed two main possible mechanisms for the drifting of fragments of continental crust (the so called sial)—that is, “Pohlflucht” (gravitational migration away from the poles) and/or solid tides induced by the Moon—but neither was considered plausible or able to generate such movements.

A crucial missing piece in this debate was in-depth knowledge of the ocean floor, which covers more than 70% of Earth's surface. Indeed, until the first half of the past century, almost nothing was known about the real composition and physiography of the ocean floor, an area of the planet too large to be ignored in geological models at the macroscale. This is where, as some had begun to suspect, the evidence for the driving force of continental drift was hiding. Here, Marie Tharp played a key role in the 1950s when, by comparing bathymetric profiles across the Atlantic Ocean, she realized the continuity of the ocean ridges and the presence of an axial valley testifying to their expansion. The mid-Atlantic ridge was discovered by Tharp in 1952 by comparing six sheets of cruise profiles, but the existence of a V-shaped rift was initially cautiously rejected by her colleague Bruce Heezen because its mobilist implications were too radical for a scientific community that had largely rejected, if not ridiculed, the Wegener continental drift hypotheses. In a later interview, Heezen declared, “I discounted it as girl talk and didn't believe it for a year.”



Subsequent research by Tharp and Heezen at the Lamont Geological Observatory of Columbia University (now the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) led to a completely new and unexpected picture of the ocean floor, providing a crucial piece of data (together with magnetic reversal and hypocenter location) that would lead in a few years to the plate tectonic hypothesis. Heezen made several important discoveries in marine geology, especially with regard to sea-floor sediments and currents, challenging the traditional “permanentist” geological conception; he was also one of the principal collectors of data from the sea floor, with a 30-year project of collaborations that resulted in the first world map of the ocean floor in 1977, a document distinctive for its geological importance. By then, Heezen had devoted his professional life to studying the secrets of the oceans, dying at sea from a heart attack aboard a submarine in 1977.

Having graduated with degrees in both geology and mathematics, Marie Tharp had skills that proved to be fundamental to the realization of ocean-basin topographic maps, a process that required in-depth knowledge of geography, mathematics, and geology. By using her mathematic skills, she was able to transform the huge amount of collected raw bathymetric data (the echo-sounders were in their early stage, having been invented only a few decades before) into profiles and maps.

From the early 1960s onward, Heezen and Tharp published influential papers with profiles, graphs, and contour diagrams focused on the mid-Atlantic ridge and all the systems of fractures affecting this major feature. The ability to graphically transform ocean floor data into visible objects considerably facilitated new inferences and hypotheses, as well as easier communication of the evidence on which new theories could be soundly based. It was precisely these graphical results that inspired authors like J. Tuzo Wilson to propose an entirely new category of “faults”: the transform faults, a system of faults along a plate boundary characterized by a predominantly horizontal motion. Once they were appreciated, transform faults played a fundamental role in the paradigm shift of plate tectonics in geology.

The publication in 1977 by Heezen and Tharp of the legendary first complete world map of the ocean floors (see the photo ) revealed to the general public the thousands-of-kilometers-long complex system of ocean ridges, fracture zones, seamounts, and trenches, revealing the geodynamic processes shaping our planet. It is regrettable to note that at the beginning of her career, Marie Tharp, as a woman, was not allowed to board the ships that were collecting the data she was studying and that her first hypotheses on sea-floor spreading were treated as mere “girl talk.” Now, her intuitions have been fully appreciated and vindicated, stressing the too-often-ignored central contribution of women to the development of science."
