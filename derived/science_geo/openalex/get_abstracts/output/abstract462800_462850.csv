https://openalex.org/W2003665515,"Recent studies indicate that a subclass of APOBEC cytidine deaminases, which convert cytosine to uracil during RNA editing and retrovirus or retrotransposon restriction, may induce mutation clusters in human tumors. We show here that throughout cancer genomes APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is pervasive and correlates with APOBEC mRNA levels. Mutation clusters in whole-genome and exome data sets conformed to the stringent criteria indicative of an APOBEC mutation pattern. Applying these criteria to 954,247 mutations in 2,680 exomes from 14 cancer types, mostly from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), showed a significant presence of the APOBEC mutation pattern in bladder, cervical, breast, head and neck, and lung cancers, reaching 68% of all mutations in some samples. Within breast cancer, the HER2-enriched subtype was clearly enriched for tumors with the APOBEC mutation pattern, suggesting that this type of mutagenesis is functionally linked with cancer development. The APOBEC mutation pattern also extended to cancer-associated genes, implying that ubiquitous APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis is carcinogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2104153021,"Reuben Harris and colleagues report an analysis of gene expression and mutation data for multiple tumor types. They show that the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is upregulated and that its preferred target sequence is frequently mutated in many types of cancer Thousands of somatic mutations accrue in most human cancers, and their causes are largely unknown. We recently showed that the DNA cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B accounts for up to half of the mutational load in breast carcinomas expressing this enzyme. Here we address whether APOBEC3B is broadly responsible for mutagenesis in multiple tumor types. We analyzed gene expression data and mutation patterns, distributions and loads for 19 different cancer types, with over 4,800 exomes and 1,000,000 somatic mutations. Notably, APOBEC3B is upregulated, and its preferred target sequence is frequently mutated and clustered in at least six distinct cancers: bladder, cervix, lung (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), head and neck, and breast. Interpreting these findings in the light of previous genetic, cellular and biochemical studies, the most parsimonious conclusion from these global analyses is that APOBEC3B-catalyzed genomic uracil lesions are responsible for a large proportion of both dispersed and clustered mutations in multiple distinct cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2036275511,"Bart Staels and his colleagues show that the transcription factor Rev-erb-α is highly expressed in oxidative muscle and, via loss- and gain-of-function experiments, including pharmacological activation, that it plays a key partin regulating the oxidative capacity of the muscle and exercise endurance. The nuclear receptor Rev-erb-α modulates hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism, adipogenesis and the inflammatory response in macrophages. We show here that Rev-erb-α is highly expressed in oxidative skeletal muscle and that its deficiency in muscle leads to reduced mitochondrial content and oxidative function, as well as upregulation of autophagy. These cellular effects resulted in both impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and increased clearance of this organelle, leading to compromised exercise capacity. On a molecular level, Rev-erb-α deficiency resulted in deactivation of the Lkb1-Ampk-Sirt1–Ppargc-1α signaling pathway. These effects were recapitulated in isolated fibers and in muscle cells after knockdown of the gene encoding Rev-erb-α, Nr1d1. In complementary experiments, Rev-erb-α overexpression in vitro increased the number of mitochondria and improved respiratory capacity, whereas muscle overexpression or pharmacological activation of Rev-erb-α in vivo increased exercise capacity. This study identifies Rev-erb-α as a pharmacological target that improves muscle oxidative function by modulating gene networks controlling mitochondrial number and function."
https://openalex.org/W2037700362,"Prostate tumors develop resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by multiple mechanisms, one of which is to express constitutively active androgen receptor (AR) splice variants lacking the ligand-binding domain. AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7, also termed AR3) is the most abundantly expressed variant that drives prostate tumor progression under ADT conditions. However, the molecular mechanism by which AR-V7 is generated remains unclear. In this manuscript, we demonstrated that RNA splicing of AR-V7 in response to ADT was closely associated with AR gene transcription initiation and elongation rates. Enhanced AR gene transcription by ADT provides a prerequisite condition that further increases the interactions between AR pre-mRNA and splicing factors. Under ADT conditions, recruitment of several RNA splicing factors to the 3' splicing site for AR-V7 was increased. We identified two RNA splicing enhancers and their binding proteins (U2AF65 and ASF/SF2) that had critical roles in splicing AR pre-mRNA into AR-V7. These data indicate that ADT-induced AR gene transcription rate and splicing factor recruitment to AR pre-mRNA contribute to the enhanced AR-V7 levels in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2022401803,"In this study, the authors show that the spatial responses of populations of grid cells are constrained to a two-dimensional activity manifold, and the relationships between pairs of grid cells are resistant to perturbation. These findings provide evidence of low-dimensional continuous attractor dynamics in the network. We examined simultaneously recorded spikes from multiple rat grid cells, to explain mechanisms underlying their activity. Among grid cells with similar spatial periods, the population activity was confined to lie close to a two-dimensional (2D) manifold: grid cells differed only along two dimensions of their responses and otherwise were nearly identical. Relationships between cell pairs were conserved despite extensive deformations of single-neuron responses. Results from novel environments suggest such structure is not inherited from hippocampal or external sensory inputs. Across conditions, cell-cell relationships are better conserved than responses of single cells. Finally, the system is continually subject to perturbations that, were the 2D manifold not attractive, would drive the system to inhabit a different region of state space than observed. These findings have strong implications for theories of grid-cell activity and substantiate the general hypothesis that the brain computes using low-dimensional continuous attractors."

https://openalex.org/W2001402566,"Thomas Wicker and colleagues report the whole-genome sequencing of four wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici) isolates from different geographic regions. Their comparative genomic analysis provides insights into the evolution of powdery mildews, which are obligate biotropic fungal pathogens. Wheat powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici, is a devastating fungal pathogen with a poorly understood evolutionary history. Here we report the draft genome sequence of wheat powdery mildew, the resequencing of three additional isolates from different geographic regions and comparative analyses with the barley powdery mildew genome. Our comparative genomic analyses identified 602 candidate effector genes, with many showing evidence of positive selection. We characterize patterns of genetic diversity and suggest that mildew genomes are mosaics of ancient haplogroups that existed before wheat domestication. The patterns of diversity in modern isolates suggest that there was no pronounced loss of genetic diversity upon formation of the new host bread wheat 10,000 years ago. We conclude that the ready adaptation of B. graminis f.sp. tritici to the new host species was based on a diverse haplotype pool that provided great genetic potential for pathogen variation."
https://openalex.org/W2080987963,"Central norepinephrine-producing neurons comprise a diverse population of cells differing in anatomical location, connectivity, function and response to disease and environmental insult. The mechanisms that generate this diversity are unknown. Here we elucidate the lineal relationship between molecularly distinct progenitor populations in the developing mouse hindbrain and mature norepinephrine neuron subtype identity. We have identified four genetically separable subpopulations of mature norepinephrine neurons differing in their anatomical location, axon morphology and efferent projection pattern. One of the subpopulations showed an unexpected projection to the prefrontal cortex, challenging the long-held belief that the locus coeruleus is the sole source of norepinephrine projections to the cortex. These findings reveal the embryonic origins of central norepinephrine neurons and provide multiple molecular points of entry for future study of individual norepinephrine circuits in complex behavioral and physiological processes including arousal, attention, mood, memory, appetite and homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2085225921,"Accumulating data have shown the involvement of microRNAs in cancerous processes as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Here, we established miR-30a as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer development and metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-30a in breast cancer cell lines resulted in the suppression of cell growth and metastasis in vitro. Consistently, the xenograft mouse model also unveiled the suppressive effects of miR-30a on tumor growth and distal pulmonary metastasis. With dual luciferase reporter assay, we revealed that miR-30a could bind to the 3′-untranslated region of metadherin (MTDH) gene, thus exerting inhibitory effect on MTDH. Furthermore, we demonstrated that silence of MTDH could recapitulate the effects of miR-30a overexpression, while overexpression of MTDH could partially abrogate miR-30a-mediated suppression. Of significance, expression level of miR-30a was found to be significantly lower in primary breast cancer tissues than in the paired normal tissues. Further evaluation verified that miR-30a was negatively correlated with the extent of lymph node and lung metastasis in patients with breast cancer. Taken together, our findings indicated miR-30a inhibits breast cancer proliferation and metastasis by directly targeting MTDH, and miR-30a can serve as a prognostic marker for breast cancer. Manipulation of miR-30a may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2034942408,"Abnormal proliferation and phenotypic modulation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous cardiovascular disorders, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway is linked to PASMC proliferation and PAH. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function in diverse biological processes. To systemically identify the specific miRNAs that regulate the NFAT pathway, a human primary miRNA library was applied for cell-based high throughput screening with the NFAT luciferase reporter system. Eight miRNAs were found to modulate NFAT activity efficiently. Of them, miR-124 robustly inhibited NFAT reporter activity and decreased both the dephosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of NFAT. miR-124 also inhibited NFAT-dependent transcription of IL-2 in Jurkat T cells. miR-124 exerted its effects by targeting multiple genes, including a known component of the NFAT pathway, NFATc1, and two new regulators of NFAT signaling, CAMTA1 (calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1) and PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1). Physiologically, miR-124 was down-regulated by hypoxia in human PASMC, consistent with the activation of NFAT during this process. Down-regulation of miR-124 was also observed in 3-week hypoxia-treated mouse lungs. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-124 not only inhibited human PASMC proliferation but also maintained its differentiated phenotype by repressing the NFAT pathway. Taken together, our data provide the first evidence that miR-124 acts as an inhibitor of the NFAT pathway. Down-regulation of miR-124 in hypoxia-treated PASMC and its antiproliferative and prodifferentiation effects imply a potential value for miR-124 in the treatment of PAH."

https://openalex.org/W1967407054,"During B cell development, cells that fail to productively rearrange their immunoglobulin VH-DJH gene segments to generate an in-frame junction that codes for a functional pre-B cell receptor are deleted. Markus Müschen and colleagues now report that Bach2 is a key component of this pre-B cell receptor checkpoint that enables the elimination of normal and transformed B cells with nonfunctional V(D)J rearrangements by regulating the expression of p53. The B cell–specific transcription factor BACH2 is required for affinity maturation of B cells. Here we show that Bach2-mediated activation of p53 is required for stringent elimination of pre-B cells that failed to productively rearrange immunoglobulin VH-DJH gene segments. After productive VH-DJH gene rearrangement, pre-B cell receptor signaling ends BACH2-mediated negative selection through B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)-mediated repression of p53. In patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the BACH2-mediated checkpoint control is compromised by deletions, rare somatic mutations and loss of its upstream activator, PAX5. Low levels of BACH2 expression in these patients represent a strong independent predictor of poor clinical outcome. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2+/+ pre-B cells resist leukemic transformation by Myc through Bach2-dependent upregulation of p53 and do not initiate fatal leukemia in transplant-recipient mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and gene expression analyses carried out by us revealed that BACH2 competes with BCL6 for promoter binding and reverses BCL6-mediated repression of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint–control genes. These findings identify BACH2 as a crucial mediator of negative selection at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint and a safeguard against leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2062518114,"Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat in the huntingtin protein (HTT), but the pathophysiological sequence of events that trigger synaptic failure and neuronal loss are not fully understood. Alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have been implicated. Yet, it remains unclear how the HTT mutation affects NMDAR function, and direct evidence for a causative role is missing. Here we show that mutant HTT redirects an intracellular store of juvenile NMDARs containing GluN3A subunits to the surface of striatal neurons by sequestering and disrupting the subcellular localization of the endocytic adaptor PACSIN1, which is specific for GluN3A. Overexpressing GluN3A in wild-type mouse striatum mimicked the synapse loss observed in Huntington's disease mouse models, whereas genetic deletion of GluN3A prevented synapse degeneration, ameliorated motor and cognitive decline and reduced striatal atrophy and neuronal loss in the YAC128 Huntington's disease mouse model. Furthermore, GluN3A deletion corrected the abnormally enhanced NMDAR currents, which have been linked to cell death in Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our findings reveal an early pathogenic role of GluN3A dysregulation in Huntington's disease and suggest that therapies targeting GluN3A or pathogenic HTT-PACSIN1 interactions might prevent or delay disease progression."

https://openalex.org/W2006993557,"The formation of dynamic membrane microdomains is an important phenomenon in many signal transduction and membrane trafficking events. It is driven by intrinsic properties of membrane lipids and integral as well as membrane-associated proteins. Here we analyzed the ability of one peripherally associated membrane protein, annexin A2 (AnxA2), to induce the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-rich domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of complex lipid composition. AnxA2 is a cytosolic protein that can bind PI(4,5)P2 and other acidic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that has been implicated in cellular membrane dynamics in endocytosis and exocytosis. We show that AnxA2 binding to GUVs induces lipid phase separation and the recruitment of PI(4,5)P2, cholesterol and glycosphingolipids into larger clusters. This property is observed for the full-length monomeric protein, a mutant derivative comprising the C-terminal protein core domain and for AnxA2 residing in a heterotetrameric complex with its intracellular binding partner S100A10. All AnxA2 derivatives inducing PI(4,5)P2 clustering are also capable of forming interconnections between PI(4,5)P2-rich microdomains of adjacent GUVs. Furthermore, they can induce membrane indentations rich in PI(4,5)P2 and inward budding of these membrane domains into the lumen of GUVs. This inward vesiculation is specific for AnxA2 and not shared with other PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase Cδ1.

https://openalex.org/W2038127753,"Foxp3 is a transcription factor required for the development of regulatory T cells (Treg). Mice and humans with a loss of Foxp3 function suffer from uncontrolled autoimmunity and inflammatory disease. Expression of Foxp3 is necessary for the anti-inflammatory capacity of Treg, but whether Foxp3 activity is further subject to regulation by extracellular signals is unclear. The primary structure of Foxp3 contains four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) motifs (Ser/Thr-Pro) within the N-terminal repressor domain, and we show that CDK2 can partner with cyclin E to phosphorylate Foxp3 at these sites. Consistent with our previous demonstration that CDK2 negatively regulates Treg function, we find that mutation of the serine or threonine at each CDK motif to alanine (S/T→A) results in enhanced Foxp3 protein stability in CD4+ T cells. T cells expressing the S/T→A mutant of Foxp3 showed enhanced induction (e.g. CD25) and repression (e.g. IL2) of canonical Foxp3-responsive genes, exhibited an increased capacity to suppress conventional T cell proliferation in vitro, and were highly effective at ameliorating colitis in an in vivo model of inflammatory bowel disease.

The primary amino acid sequence of murine Foxp3 contains multiple putative kinase motifs, including four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) substrate motifs concentrated within the N-terminal repressor domain. Our previous studies showed that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)-deficient Treg are more suppressive than wild type Treg, as measured by the ability to suppress the proliferation of conventional CD4+ T cells in vitro and to ameliorate colitis in an in vivo mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (14.Chunder N.

These findings demonstrate an important role for CDK2 in Treg biology, but did not establish the mechanism by which CDK2 functions in these cells. Considering the presence of multiple CDK motifs in the Foxp3 primary sequence, we hypothesized that CDK2 may influence Treg function through phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Foxp3. In this study, we find that CDK2 can phosphorylate Foxp3 and that mutation of the N-terminal CDK motifs increases the half-life, steady-state level, and transcriptional activity of Foxp3. Furthermore, T cells expressing CDK mutant Foxp3 exhibit increased suppressive function as compared with cells expressing wild type Foxp3. Our results indicate that CDK2 activity controls Treg suppressive function through setting the amount of Foxp3 available in the cell. Female C57BL/6 (H-2b) and Rag1-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in our specific pathogen-free facility according to University Laboratory Animal Resources (ULAR)- and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-approved institutional guidelines on animal care and usage. All mice were used at 6–14 weeks of age.

The bacterial culture was grown at 37 °C, and Foxp3 expression was induced with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm, 12 h, 30 °C). For the purification of the His6-Foxp3 recombinant protein, cells were harvested from 500-ml culture, and the recombinant protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin by affinity chromatography under native conditions. 0.5 μg of His6-Foxp3 or 1 μg of control histone H1 (Roche Applied Science) was incubated with CDK2-cycE (Millipore) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer) in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1× SDS-PAGE lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Roscovitine (Cell Signaling) was used to inhibit CDK2 activity. His6-Foxp3 was incubated with CDK2-cycE and cold ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Foxp3 band was then excised, destained, reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich), and digested in-gel with trypsin. The extracted tryptic peptides were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC mass spectrometry using an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The assignment of phosphate to product ions identified was made using a Mascot search of MS2 data against the Oniprot mouse protein sequence database. Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3 mutant was generated using the Stratagene QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. Mutagenesis primers used were: S19A-Fwd, 5′-cttggcccttggcccagccccaggag-3′, S19A-Rev, 5′-ctcctggggctgggccaagggccaag-3′, S88A-Fwd, 5′-ccgactaggtcccgcaccccacctaca-3′, S88A-Rev, 5′-tgtaggtggggtgcgggacctagtcgg-3, T114A-Fwd, 5′-gcccatgcccaggcccctgtgctcc-3′, T114A-Rev, 5′-ggagcacaggggcctgggcatgggc-3′, T175A-Fwd, 5′-cccacgctcgggtgcacccaggaaaga-3′, T175A-Rev, 5′-tctttcctgggtgcacccgagcgtggg-3′. HEK293 cells were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysis buffer was supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) and β-glycerophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). Where indicated, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) and the CDK2 inhibitor roscovitine (Sigma-Aldrich). Affinity-purified p+Ser-19-Foxp3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (YenZym) was used to detect phosphorylated species of Foxp3. Lyophilized Foxp3 peptide (aa 12–24), either unmodified or phosphorylated at serine 19, was resuspended at 10 mg/ml and serially diluted with PBS. Amounts of peptide from 500 μg to 0.05 ng were placed on nitrocellulose in log10 dilutions. Western blot was then performed using p+Ser-19-Foxp3 (YenZym). Murine Foxp3 cDNA was amplified from wild type C57BL/6 thymus and cloned into the murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector (6.Chen C. Rowell E.A. Thomas R.M. Hancock W.W. Wells A.D. Transcriptional regulation by Foxp3 is associated with direct promoter occupancy and modulation of histone acetylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36828-36834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) expressing the reporter gene GFP (MIGR) or human NGFR (MINR1) and containing an in-frame, N-terminal FLAG epitope. For generation of retrovirus, constructs were cotransfected (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen) with the pCLeco (Invitrogen) helper plasmid into the 293T-based Phoenix ecotropic packaging cell line (provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University). Wild type C57BL/6 CD4+CD25− naive T cells were activated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (3 ng/ml, Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (1 μm, Sigma-Aldrich), and IL-2 (10 units/ml, Roche Applied Science) for 24 h, washed, and transduced by spinfection (15.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Production of high-titer helper-free retroviruses by transient transfection.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) with supernatants from 48 h transfected Phoenix cells. Transduced cells were expanded in IL-2 for 3–4 days. CD4+ T cell transduction efficiencies were ≥90%. Where necessary, transduced T cells were purified to near 100% purity using vector reporter markers. Before analysis, transduced cells were restimulated 4–6 h with 1 μg/ml CD3 (2C11, Bio X Cell), 1 μg/ml CD28 (37.51, Bio X Cell), and IL-2 (10 units/ml, Roche Applied Science). FACS analysis was performed on a Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP. Cells were stained for FACS analysis with conjugated mouse anti-Foxp3-APC (FJK-16s, eBioscience), mouse anti-CD25-APCcy7 (PC61, BioLegend), anti-NGFR-PE (CD271, BD Pharmingen), and anti-CD4-PacificBlue (GK1.5, BioLegend). Supernatants from restimulated cells were harvested and probed for levels of IL-2 protein by ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol (eBioscience kit). Manufacturers' protocols were followed for kits to extract RNA from transduced cells (Qiagen) and convert it into cDNA (Bio-Rad). Relative Foxp3 and IL-2 message levels were determined following quantitative PCR according to the 2ΔΔCt method after normalization to actin. Whole cell extracts were generated using the radioimmune precipitation buffer lysis kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and run on precast 10% SDS-PAGE Criterion gels (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed using mouse/rat anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16s, eBioscience) and rabbit anti-p+Ser-19-Foxp3 (YenZym). Following restimulation of transduced cells with CD3, CD28, and IL-2, cells were harvested, washed, and replated in the presence of cycloheximide (25 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, and whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed for expression of Foxp3 by Western blot as described above. CD4+CD25− (Tconv) and CD90-negative APC were isolated from splenocytes of wild type C57BL/6 mice using magnetic bead-conjugated mAbs (Miltenyi). APC (1 × 105) were irradiated (1000 radians, 3 min) and plated onto 96-well round-bottomed plates along with Tconv effector cells (5 × 104/well) labeled with CellTrace (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, violet carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester equivalent) and 4 μg/ml soluble anti-CD3 mAb. T cells transduced with empty vector control, wild type Foxp3, or Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3 (serving as suppressor Treg) cells were added to each well in varying ratios to Tconv cells and cultured for 72 h. After 3 days, suppression of responder cell proliferation was measured by flow cytometry to assess the degree of inhibition of CellTrace (Invitrogen, violet carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester equivalent) dilution as previously published (16.Wells A.D. Gudmundsdottir H. Turka L.A. Following the fate of individual T cells throughout activation and clonal expansion. Signals from T cell receptor and CD28 differentially regulate the induction and duration of a proliferative response.J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To induce experimental colitis, conventional CD4+25− T cells were purified from naive, wild type C57BL/6 mice and adoptively transferred (1 × 106, intravenously) into Rag1−/− B6 recipients (17.Powrie F. Leach M.W. Mauze S. Caddle L.B. Coffman R.L. Phenotypically distinct subsets of CD4+ T cells induce or protect from chronic intestinal inflammation in C. B-17 scid mice.Int.

Inhibition of Th1 responses prevents inflammatory bowel disease in scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi CD4+ T cells.Immunity. 1994; 1: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). 21 days from the initial transfer, groups of 3–7 mice then received either PBS or T cells transduced with empty vector control, wild type Foxp3, or Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3 mutant (2 × 106, intraperitoneally). Recipients were weighed and observed for symptoms of diarrhea approximately every 2 days. At the end of the experiment, spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes, and intestines were harvested for examination of gross pathology, and histology. Colitis-induced animals were sacrificed and analyzed for signs of gross pathology using a modified version of established methods (19.Conner E.M. Brand S. Davis J.M. Laroux F.S. Palombella V.J. Fuseler J.W. Kang D.Y. Wolf R.E. Grisham M.B. Proteasome inhibition attenuates nitric oxide synthase expression, VCAM-1 transcription, and the development of chronic colitis.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 1615-1622PubMed Google Scholar). Scores of 0 (no colitis) to 4 (worst disease) were assigned according to colon rigidity, visible inflammation, and presence of blood in intestines, as well as diarrhea and presence of fat tissue. Intestines from colitis-induced animals were fixed in formaldehyde, imbedded in paraffin, sliced, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted onto glass slides for histological analysis. Blinded evaluation of H&E-stained paraffin sections was performed by a pathologist and scored using established criteria (20.Aranda R. Sydora B.C. McAllister P.L. Binder S.W. Yang H.Y. Targan S.R. Kronenberg M. Analysis of intestinal lymphocytes in mouse colitis mediated by transfer of CD4+, CD45RBhigh T cells to SCID recipients.J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3464-3473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to reach a maximum colitis score of 23. The criteria and scores were: inflammation, 0–3; mucin depletion, 0–2; reactive epithelial changes, 0–3; number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, 0–3; crypt architectural distortion, 0–3; number of inflammatory foci per 10 high power field, 1–3; inflammatory activity, 0–2; transmural inflammation, 0–2; mucosal ulceration, 0–2. All p values were calculated by Student's paired t test using Prism software (GraphPad). We analyzed the Foxp3 amino acid sequence as a primary approach to identify potential sites of post-translational modification. We found many putative kinase binding elements, including a cluster of four cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) motifs, Ser/Thr-Pro (Fig. 1). We recently demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is a negative regulator of Foxp3+ Treg function, but a biochemical basis was not established (14.Chunder N. Wang L. Chen C. Hancock W.W. Wells A.D. Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 controls peripheral immune tolerance.J. Immunol. 2012; 189: 5659-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple CDK motifs in Foxp3 suggests that CDK2 might control Treg function through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. The Foxp3 CDK motifs are concentrated in the N-terminal half of the protein. This segment of Foxp3 (aa 1–198) is necessary and sufficient for repression of the Il2 gene and is therefore referred to as a repressor domain (21.Bettelli E. Dastrange M. Oukka M. Foxp3 interacts with nuclear factor of activated T cells and NF-κB to repress cytokine gene expression and effector functions of T helper cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5138-5143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 22.Lopes J.E. Torgerson T.R. Schubert L.A. Anover S.D. Ocheltree E.L. Ochs H.D. Ziegler S.F. Analysis of FOXP3 reveals multiple domains required for its function as a transcriptional repressor.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This domain contains no defined structural motifs, so how it contributes to Foxp3 function is not understood. To test whether CDK2 can phosphorylate Foxp3, we purified full-length recombinant Foxp3 (Fig. 2A) and performed standard in vitro kinase assays. Recombinant CDK2 together with its G1/S phase binding partner cyclin E was able to phosphorylate Foxp3, and the reaction could be abrogated by the CDK inhibitor roscovitine (Fig. 2B). To map the residues phosphorylated by CDK2-cyclin E, we performed the kinase reaction with cold ATP and subjected the purified Foxp3 substrate to RP-HPLC mass spectrometry (MS). Product ions b14 and y9 from the peptide PAKPMAPSLALGPSPGVLPSWK (Fig. 2C) contain an 80-dalton increase in their expected mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio, indicative of a phosphate group at the serine followed by the proline (aa 19). Product ions containing only the other serine residues in the peptide do not contain an 80-dalton increase in m/z and are therefore not phosphorylated (Fig. 2C, supplemental Fig. S1a). An 80-dalton increase is also found in the fragment ion b5 from the peptide SGTPRKDSNLLAAPQGSYPLLANGVCK (Fig. 2D, supplemental Fig. S1b). The absence of earlier b-series ions or later y-series ions for this peptide precludes specific assignment of the phosphate group to the first serine (aa 173) or threonine (aa 175) residue in the peptide. However, CDK2 is an obligate proline-directed kinase, and therefore must be acting on threonine 175. The phosphorylation of the other two CDK target residues, serine 88 and threonine 114, was not determined as peptides containing these residues could not be isolated during enzymatic digestion preceding RP-HPLC. None of the other serine or threonine residues in Foxp3 outside these motifs were phosphorylated by CDK2 (data not shown). These data suggest that Foxp3 is phosphorylated by CDK2 on at least two of its CDK motifs, Ser-19 and Thr-175. We next generated an antibody that recognizes an N-terminal Foxp3 peptide, aa 12–24, PSLALGPpSPGVLP, containing phosphorylated serine 19. To confirm that the antibody detects only phosphorylated serine 19, we performed a dot blot using serial dilutions of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3A). Our results demonstrate that our antibody recognizes only p+Ser-19, with the limit of detection in the nanogram range. To determine whether Foxp3 can be phosphorylated on Ser-19 in an in vivo, cellular environment, we transfected HEK293 cells with a control FLAG-tagged vector, wild type Foxp3, or a mutant of Foxp3 in which the serine or threonine of all four CDK motifs was mutated to alanine (Ser/Thr→Ala). After 48 h, transfected cells were harvested and lysed in the presence of both phosphatase and proteasome inhibitors. FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed on all lysates. Whole cell extracts and FLAG immunoprecipitation eluate were analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylated and total Foxp3 (Fig. 3B). Wild type Foxp3 transfected cell lysates and FLAG immunoprecipitation eluates contain a species of Foxp3 phosphorylated on Ser-19, as detected using the p+Ser-19-Foxp3 antibody. No phosphorylated Foxp3 was detected in extracts from Ser/Thr→Ala mutant Foxp3. These data demonstrate that Foxp3 is phosphorylated at Ser-19 CDK motif by endogenous cellular machinery. Kinase activity and phosphorylation can be coupled to protein stability (23.Hunter T. The age of crosstalk: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and beyond.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 730-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). To test whether Foxp3 N-terminal CDK motifs contribute to protein stability, conventional CD4+CD25− T lymphocytes were transduced with murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vectors encoding wild type Foxp3 or the Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3 mutant (Fig. 4A). We treated empty vector-, wild type Foxp3-, or Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3-transduced CD4+ T cells with cycloheximide (CHX) and measured Foxp3 protein levels over time (Fig. 4B). Wild type Foxp3 was expressed at high levels following transduction; however, inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX revealed rapid turnover of Foxp3 within 5 h with a half-life of 2 h. Ser/Thr→Ala-Foxp3 exhibited increased protein stability; following treatment with CHX, the S/T→A(ble)-Foxp3 mutant showed a significantly increased half-life of 7–9 h as compared with wild type Foxp3 (Fig. 4C). Importantly, the transcription of S/T→A(ble)-Foxp3 is not elevated over that of wild type Foxp3 (Fig. 4D). These data indicate that CDK phosphorylation motifs are involved in the regulation of Foxp3 protein stability. Foxp3 drives a specific transcriptional program including the induction of genes such as the α chain of the IL-2 receptor, CD25, and the repression of cytokine genes such as Il2. To determine whether these CDK motifs affect the transcriptional activity of Foxp3, we compared CD4+25− naive T cells transduced with either wild type or S/T→A(ble)-Foxp3 mutant. Wild type Foxp3 induced an expected Treg-like signature (1.Hori S. Nomura T. Sakaguchi S. Control of regulatory T cell development by the transcription factor Foxp3.Science. 2003; 299: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) including high Foxp3 expression, elevated CD25 levels, and decreased IL-2 production as compared with cells transduced with empty vector. Mutation of all four CDK motifs resulted in significant elevation of Foxp3 and CD25 protein levels (Fig. 5A), as well as enhanced repression of IL-2 message (Fig. 5B) and protein (Fig. 5C) as compared with wild type. These data suggest that the CDK motifs negatively regulate Foxp3 function. Mutation of the N-terminal CDK motifs in Foxp3 resulted in elevated protein stability and increased Foxp3 transcriptional activity. Therefore, we next asked whether T cells expressing the S/T→A(ble) mutant of Foxp3 exhibited a gain of suppressive function. To test this, we used a standard, anti-CD3-driven in vitro Treg suppression assay (24.Thornton A.M. Donovan E.E. Piccirillo C.A. Shevach E.M. Cutting edge: IL-2 is critically required for the in vitro activation of CD4+CD25+ T cell suppressor function.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6519-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells expressing wild type Foxp3 were able to suppress the proliferation of conventional T cells as compared with empty vector-transduced control cells. However, cells expressing the S/T→A(ble) mutant showed significantly elevated suppressive capacity as compared with cells expressing wild type (Fig. 6). From these results, we conclude that the N-terminal CDK motifs restrain Foxp3 activity and suppressive function. To test whether the N-terminal CDK motifs contribute to the anti-inflammatory capacity of Foxp3-expressing cells in vivo, we used an adoptive transfer model of inflammatory bowel disease (17.Powrie F.

Here we investigated HDAC-dependent inflammatory responses in mouse macrophages. Of the classical Hdacs, Hdac7 was expressed at elevated levels in inflammatory macrophages (thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages) as compared with bone marrow-derived macrophages and the RAW264 cell line. Overexpression of a specific, alternatively spliced isoform of Hdac7 lacking the N-terminal 22 amino acids (Hdac7-u), but not the Refseq Hdac7 (Hdac7-s), promoted LPS-inducible expression of Hdac-dependent genes (Edn1, Il-12p40, and Il-6) in RAW264 cells. A novel class IIa-selective HDAC inhibitor reduced recombinant human HDAC7 enzyme activity as well as TLR-induced production of inflammatory mediators in thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. Both LPS and Hdac7-u up-regulated the activity of the Edn1 promoter in an HDAC-dependent fashion in RAW264 cells. A hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1 binding site in this promoter was required for HDAC-dependent TLR-inducible promoter activity and for Hdac7- and HIF-1α-mediated trans-activation. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that both Hdac7-u and Hdac7-s interacted with HIF-1α, whereas only Hdac7-s interacted with the transcriptional repressor CtBP1. Thus, Hdac7-u positively regulates HIF-1α-dependent TLR signaling in macrophages, whereas an interaction with CtBP1 likely prevents Hdac7-s from exerting this effect. Hdac7 may represent a potential inflammatory disease target."

It occurs via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), whose formation is initiated by adaptor proteins that capture cargo molecules and trigger clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane. Subsequent recruitment of endocytic accessory proteins (EAPs) drives the maturation of a deeply invaginated coated pit (1.Schmid E.M. McMahon H.T.

At later stages, dynamin self-assembles into collar-like structures at the constricted neck of a pit and catalyzes membrane fission leading to clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) release (5.Schmid S.L.

Using these assays, we demonstrated that dynamin-1 (Dyn1), the neuron-specific isoform, alone was sufficient to generate membrane curvature (i.e. tubulation) in the absence of GTP and to release vesicles from SUPER templates in a GTPase-dependent manner (7.Pucadyil T.J.

Although dynamin-2 (Dyn2), the ubiquitously-expressed isoform, can assemble onto curved templates and catalyze fission, it is much less efficient than Dyn1 in generating membrane curvature and thus catalyzing vesicle release from planar membranes (9.Liu Y.-W.

Several BAR domain-containing proteins, including endophilin, amphiphysin, and SNX9 also encode SH3 domains and interact directly with dynamin through its C-terminal proline/arginine-rich domain (PRD).

Real-time detection reveals that effectors couple dynamin's GTP-dependent conformational changes to the membrane.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, these proteins are good candidates for EAPs that could function, together with Dyn2, to enhance fission. However, recent studies have suggested that BAR domain protein scaffolds antagonize membrane fission by stabilizing curved membranes (32.Boucrot E. Pick A. Çamdere G. Liska N. Evergren E.

Membrane fission is promoted by insertion of amphipathic helices and is restricted by crescent BAR domains.Cell. 2012; 149: 124-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), whereas hydrophobic insertions by ENTH domains, in the absence of scaffolding activity, create sufficient membrane defects to facilitate the reorganization of lipids required to enable membrane fission. Indeed, this report showed that, when expressed at high concentrations, epsin can support CME in cells depleted of dynamin by siRNA. Here, we have systematically studied the effects of BAR domain-containing dynamin binding partners, amphiphysin, endophilin, and SNX9, as well as epsin, on dynamin-catalyzed vesicle release from planar SUPER templates. Our results reveal complexity in the functional interplay between dynamin and its SH3 and BAR-domain containing partners that may reflect a hierarchy of interactions that combine to regulate curvature generation and dynamin activity in CME. Dyn1, Dyn2, and various mutants were expressed from pIEX-6. Constructs were transiently transfected in Sf9 cells as previously described (33.Ramachandran R. Pucadyil T.J. Liu Y.-W. Acharya S. Leonard M. Lukiyanchuk V. Schmid S.L. Membrane insertion of the pleckstrin homology domain variable loop 1 is critical for dynamin-catalyzed vesicle scission.Mol. Biol.

Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in dynamin: evidence for a mechanochemical molecular spring.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Purified dynamin was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The endophilin N-BAR domain and mutant was a kind gift from Naoki Muchizuki (RIKEN Harima Institute, Japan, (14.Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). Full-length effector proteins (amphiphysin I, endophilin I, and SNX9) and endophilin N-BAR domain and Epsin 1 ENTH domain were expressed from pGEX6P. The SH3-domain from amphiphysin, endophilin, and SNX9 as well as the PRD of Dyn1 and Dyn2 were expressed from pGEX2T. Constructs were transformed into BL21. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG at OD600 ∼0.7 for 3 h at 30 °C. Proteins were purified following the manufacturer's instructions, and the GST tag was removed with Prescission Protease (GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) from constructs expressed from pGEX6P. Proteins were stored in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT and 10% glycerol at −80 °C. For liposomes, lipid mixtures (DOPC:DOPS:PIP2 80:15:5) were dried and rehydrated in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 150 mm KCl) to a final concentration of 1 mm, and subjected to a series of freeze-thaw cycles before extrusion through polycarbonate membranes (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) with a pore size of 1 μm using an Avanti Mini-Extruder. SUPER templates were generated as previously reported (7.Pucadyil T.J. Schmid S.L.

Protoc. 2013; 8: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), all solutions for their preparation were filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and incubations were performed in low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes (USA Scientific). Briefly, silica beads (5 × 106 silicon oxide microspheres d = 4.97 μm, or 15 × 106 silicon oxide microspheres d = 2.5 μm Corpuscular, Cold Spring, NY) were incubated with 20 nmol of 100 nm extruded liposomes (DOPC:DOPS:PIP2:RhoPE 79:15:5:1) in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5 and 1 m NaCl for 5 μm silica beads or 200 mm NaCl for 2.5 μm silica beads in a final volume of 100 μl. The mix was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To wash the templates 1 ml of water was added, and tubes were centrifuged in a swing-out centrifuge rotor (AllegraTM 6R Centrifuge, Beckman). 1 ml of supernatant was removed by pipetting, and the residual 100 μl reaction was mixed with 1 ml of water by gentle vortexing (medium speed), and washing was repeated four times. All experiments were performed in low adhesion microcentrifuge tubes (USA Scientific). To measure vesicle release 5 × 105 of 5 μm templates or 20 × 105 of 2.5 μm templates were added to buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP at a final volume of 100 μl and indicated concentrations of dynamin and effector proteins for 30 min at room temperature. During this incubation, templates were allowed to settle without further mixing. Templates were pelleted at 260 × g in a swing-out centrifuge rotor (AllegraTM 6R Centrifuge, Beckman), and 75 μl of the supernatants were mixed with 25 μl of 0.4% Triton X-100 to dissolve vesicles. Total fluorescence of templates was determined in a separate reaction containing the same amount of SUPER templates in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence was measured in a 96 well fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) and vesicle release is expressed as RhPE released into the supernatant as percentage of total RhPE fluorescence of SUPER templates (35.Neumann S. Pucadyil T.J. Schmid S.L. Analyzing membrane remodeling and fission using supported bilayers with excess membrane reservoir.Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fluorescence released in the absence of GTP is subtracted as background. Assays for fission activity on membrane tethers were performed in Lab-Tek chambers (Nunc) that had been pre-incubated for 20 min with 2 mg/ml BSA. These were washed and 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP with an oxygen scavenger system, which was essential to prevent photo-damage of proteins, that consisted of 50 μg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), 10 μg/ml catalase (Roche), 2.5 mm glucose (Sigma), and 1 mm DTT was added. To this, we added 5 × 105 SUPER templates and allowed them to settle onto the coverslip. Tethers were generated by the addition of 20 μm naked silica beads, which were gently rolled over the surface of the SUPER templates through gentle agitation of the Lab-Tek chamber. Fluorescence imaging was carried out at room temperature on an inverted Olympus IX-70 microscope with a 100×, 1.35 NA oil-immersion objective, and equipped with an ORCA ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu) and 617/73 nm emission filters for RhPE-labeled membranes. Dynamin or ENTH domain was added at the indicated concentration to the corner and allowed to diffuse across the chamber. Curvature generation experiments were executed as above except that SUPER templates were allowed to settle in a buffer containing 0.5 μm dynamin or effector proteins without GTP. Pictures were taken after an incubation of 10 min at room temperature. GTP hydrolysis by dynamin was measured as a function of time using a colorimetric malachite green assay that detects the release of inorganic phosphate (36.Leonard M. Song B.D. Ramachandran R. Schmid S.L. Robust colorimetric assays for dynamin's basal and stimulated GTPase activities.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 404: 490-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 μm dynamin with or without 0.5 μm effector protein were added to 150 μm 1 μm liposomes in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm GTP, and 2 mm MgCl2. Aliquots were taken at several time points. Free phosphate was determined using malachite green and rates of hydrolysis were calculated. We previously showed that Dyn2 was less effective than Dyn1 at catalyzing vesicle release from SUPER templates because it was less effective at generating curvature on planar lipid templates (9.Liu Y.-W. Neumann S. Ramachandran R. Ferguson S.M. Pucadyil T.J. Schmid S.L. Differential curvature sensing and generating activities of dynamin isoforms provide opportunities for tissue-specific regulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2011; 108: E234-E242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether curvature-generating N-BAR domains might be able to function synergistically with Dyn2 to catalyze membrane fission. We first studied the well-characterized N-BAR domain of endophilin. Addition of 0.5 μm endophilin N-BAR domain to SUPER templates resulted in the formation of long membrane tubules. These concentrations are significantly lower than those used in most liposome tubulation assays (typically 5–10 μm), attesting to the efficient ability of endophilin N-BAR to generate curvature and self-assemble into a protein scaffold on these fluid membrane templates (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the N-BAR-a4 mutant, which bears a flexible insert that disrupts the rigid BAR domain dimer failed to tubulate SUPER templates. Masuda et al. (14.Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. Endophilin BAR domain drives membrane curvature by two newly identified structure-based mechanisms.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) have shown that this mutant retains its ability to bind to liposomes, but is unable to generate curvature on these templates. In the absence of dynamin, even at high concentrations, the wild-type endophilin N-BAR domain alone was unable to mediate fission of these tubules or to release vesicles from SUPER templates (results not shown). Likewise, when assayed at low concentrations, Dyn2-alone is inefficient at catalyzing vesicle release (Fig. 1B and Ref. 9.Liu Y.-W. Neumann S. Ramachandran R. Ferguson S.M. Pucadyil T.J. Schmid S.L. Differential curvature sensing and generating activities of dynamin isoforms provide opportunities for tissue-specific regulation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2011; 108: E234-E242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, together the two functioned synergistically to efficiently release vesicles when incubated with SUPER templates (Fig. 1B). The ability of N-BAR to enhance Dyn2 activity plateaued at ∼equimolar concentrations. N-BAR-a4 did not facilitate dynamin-catalyzed vesicle release, indicating that curvature generation by the N-BAR domain was essential for this activity. Vesicle release absolutely required the GTPase activity of Dyn2: the fluorescence released in the absence of GTP was equal to that released in the absence of dynamin and was subtracted as background in all experiments. The endophilin N-BAR, but not N-BAR-a4, also functioned synergistically with subsaturating concentrations (0.2 μm) of Dyn1 (Fig. 1D). Again, the ability to support Dyn1 activity reached a plateau at ∼equimolar N-BAR, without evidence of inhibition at higher concentrations of N-BAR (results not shown). Vesicle release by Dyn1 can be visualized in real-time by fluorescence microscopy (7.Pucadyil T.J. Schmid S.L.

Although Dyn2 alone had very low activity in this assay, in the presence of wild type N-BAR domain we observed the release of both small vesicles and short tubules, which adsorbed onto the coverslip and were presumably coated with N-BAR and/or Dyn2 (supplemental movie S1). In summary, these experiments show that the curvature generating properties of the N-BAR domain work synergistically with Dyn2 to catalyze vesicle release. We have previously shown that efficient vesicle release by Dyn1 requires both insertion of hydrophobic residues located within the variable loops 1 and 3 (VL1 and VL3) of its PH domain (9.Liu Y.-W.

Morphologically it resembles the sheathed tail of bacteriophages such as T4, including a baseplate at one end. It also shares features with the type VI secretion systems. Cryo-electron micrographs of tilted Afp specimens (up to 60 degrees) were analyzed to determine the correct cyclic symmetry to overcome the limitation imposed by exclusively side views in nominally untilted specimens. An asymmetric reconstruction shows clear 6-fold cyclic symmetry contrary to a previous conclusion of 4-fold symmetry based on analysis of only the preferred side views (Sen, A., Rybakova, D., Hurst, M. R., and Mitra, A. K. (2010) J. Bacteriol. 192, 4522-4525). Electron tomography of negatively stained Afp revealed right-handed helical striations in many of the particles, establishing the correct hand. Higher quality micrographs of untilted specimens were processed to produce a reconstruction at 2.0-nm resolution with imposed 6-fold symmetry. The helical parameters of the sheath were determined to be 8.14 nm for the subunit rise along and 40.5° for the rotation angle around the helix. The sheath is similar to that of the T4 phage tail but with a different arrangement of the subdomain of the polymerizing sheath protein(s). The central tube is similar to the diameter and axial width of the Hcp1 hexamer of P. aeruginosa type VI secretion system. The tube extends through the baseplate into a needle resembling the ""puncture device"" of the T4 tail. The tube contains density that may be the toxin and/or a length-determining protein."
https://openalex.org/W2087694422,"The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi lacks endogenous, surface-exposed proteases. In order to efficiently disseminate throughout the host and penetrate tissue barriers, borreliae rely on recruitment of host proteases, such as plasmin(ogen). Here we report the identification of a novel plasminogen-binding protein, BBA70. Binding of plasminogen is dose-dependent and is affected by ionic strength. The BBA70-plasminogen interaction is mediated by lysine residues, primarily located in a putative C-terminal α-helix of BBA70. These lysine residues appear to interact with the lysine-binding sites in plasminogen kringle domain 4 because a deletion mutant of plasminogen lacking that domain was unable to bind to BBA70. Bound to BBA70, plasminogen activated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator was able to degrade both a synthetic chromogenic substrate and the natural substrate fibrinogen. Furthermore, BBA70-bound plasmin was able to degrade the central complement proteins C3b and C5 and inhibited the bacteriolytic effects of complement. Consistent with these functional activities, BBA70 is located on the borrelial outer surface. Additionally, serological evidence demonstrated that BBA70 is produced during mammalian infection. Taken together, recruitment and activation of plasminogen could play a beneficial role in dissemination of B. burgdorferi in the human host and may possibly aid the spirochete in escaping the defense mechanisms of innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1973262826,"Imbalance in metal ion homeostasis is a hallmark in neurodegenerative conditions involving protein deposition, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is no exception. In particular, Ca(2+) dysregulation has been shown to correlate with superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) aggregation in a cellular model of ALS. Here we present evidence that SOD1 aggregation is enhanced and modulated by Ca(2+). We show that at physiological pH, Ca(2+) induces conformational changes that increase SOD1 β-sheet content, as probed by far UV CD and attenuated total reflectance-FTIR, and enhances SOD1 hydrophobicity, as probed by ANS fluorescence emission. Moreover, dynamic light scattering analysis showed that Ca(2+) boosts the onset of SOD1 aggregation. In agreement, Ca(2+) decreases SOD1 critical concentration and nucleation time during aggregation kinetics, as evidenced by thioflavin T fluorescence emission. Attenuated total reflectance FTIR analysis showed that Ca(2+) induced aggregates consisting preferentially of antiparallel β-sheets, thus suggesting a modulation effect on the aggregation pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and analysis with conformational anti-fibril and anti-oligomer antibodies showed that oligomers and amyloidogenic aggregates constitute the prevalent morphology of Ca(2+)-induced aggregates, thus indicating that Ca(2+) diverts SOD1 aggregation from fibrils toward amorphous aggregates. Interestingly, the same heterogeneity of conformations is found in ALS-derived protein inclusions. We thus hypothesize that transient variations and dysregulation of cellular Ca(2+) levels contribute to the formation of SOD1 aggregates in ALS patients. In this scenario, Ca(2+) may be considered as a pathogenic effector in the formation of ALS proteinaceous inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2023588672,"Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins play essential roles in the regulation of signaling via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). With hundreds of GPCRs and dozens of G proteins, it is important to understand how RGS regulates selective GPCR-G protein signaling. In neurons of the striatum, two RGS proteins, RGS7 and RGS9-2, regulate signaling by μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and are implicated in drug addiction, movement disorders, and nociception. Both proteins form trimeric complexes with the atypical G protein β subunit Gβ5 and a membrane anchor, R7BP. In this study, we examined GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) activity as well as Gα and GPCR selectivity of RGS7 and RGS9-2 complexes in live cells using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay that monitors dissociation of G protein subunits. We showed that RGS9-2/Gβ5 regulated both Gi and Go with a bias toward Go, but RGS7/Gβ5 could serve as a GAP only for Go. Interestingly, R7BP enhanced GAP activity of RGS7 and RGS9-2 toward Go and Gi and enabled RGS7 to regulate Gi signaling. Neither RGS7 nor RGS9-2 had any activity toward Gz, Gs, or Gq in the absence or presence of R7BP. We also observed no effect of GPCRs (MOR and D2R) on the G protein bias of R7 RGS proteins. However, the GAP activity of RGS9-2 showed a strong receptor preference for D2R over MOR. Finally, RGS7 displayed an four times greater GAP activity relative to RGS9-2. These findings illustrate the principles involved in establishing G protein and GPCR selectivity of striatal RGS proteins."

Partial 3-hydroxylation of the A3 site (Pro-707) was present in tendon and bone, but absent in skin in both α-chains of the wild type animals. Type I collagen extracted from bone of P3H1 null mice shows a large reduction in 3-hydroxylation of the A3 site in both α-chains, whereas type I collagen extracted from tendon of P3H1 null mice shows little difference as compared with wild type. These results demonstrate that the A1 site in type I collagen is exclusively 3-hydroxylated by P3H1, and presumably, this enzyme is required for the 3-hydroxylation of the A3 site of both α-chains in bone but not in tendon. The increase in glycosylation of hydroxylysine in P3H1 null mice in bone was found to be due to an increased occupancy of normally glycosylated sites. Despite the severe disorganization of collagen fibrils in adult tissues, the D-period of the fibrils is unchanged. Tendon fibrils of newborn P3H1 null mice are well organized with only a slight increase in diameter.

https://openalex.org/W2083604548,"In this paper, Hunt and colleagues provide the first demonstration of bidirectional plasticity of NMDA receptor–mediated synaptic transmission at the hippocampal mossy fiber to CA3 synapse in rats. They also show that this form of long-term plasticity can influence CA3 burst firing and spike temporal fidelity, and exert bidirectional metaplastic control over plasticity at associational-commissural synapses. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are classically known as coincidence detectors for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity and have been implicated in hippocampal CA3 cell–dependent spatial memory functions that likely rely on dynamic cellular ensemble encoding of space. The unique functional properties of both NMDARs and mossy fiber projections to CA3 pyramidal cells place mossy fiber NMDARs in a prime position to influence CA3 ensemble dynamics. By mimicking presynaptic and postsynaptic activity patterns observed in vivo, we found a burst timing–dependent pattern of activity that triggered bidirectional long-term NMDAR plasticity at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses in rat hippocampal slices. This form of plasticity imparts bimodal control of mossy fiber–driven CA3 burst firing and spike temporal fidelity. Moreover, we found that mossy fiber NMDARs mediate heterosynaptic metaplasticity between mossy fiber and associational-commissural synapses. Thus, bidirectional NMDAR plasticity at mossy fiber–CA3 synapses could substantially contribute to the formation, storage and recall of CA3 cell assembly patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2096604171,"Activation of the FcγR via antigen containing immune complexes can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which are potent signal transducing molecules. However, whether ROS contribute to FcγR signaling has not been studied extensively. We set out to elucidate the role of NADPH oxidase-generated ROS in macrophage activation following FcγR engagement using antigen-containing immune complexes. We hypothesized that NOX2 generated ROS is necessary for propagation of downstream FcγR signaling and initiation of the innate immune response. Following exposure of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to inactivated Francisella tularensis (iFt)-containing immune complexes, we observed a significant increase in the innate inflammatory cytokine IL-6 at 24 h compared with macrophages treated with Ft LVS-containing immune complexes. Ligation of the FcγR by opsonized Ft also results in significant ROS production. Macrophages lacking the gp91(phox) subunit of NOX2 fail to produce ROS upon FcγR ligation, resulting in decreased Akt phosphorylation and a reduction in the levels of IL-6 compared with wild type macrophages. Similar results were seen following infection of BMDMs with catalase deficient Ft that fail to scavenge hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that ROS participate in elicitation of an effective innate immune in response to antigen-containing immune complexes through FcγR."
https://openalex.org/W2033126852,"Previous work has identified distinct functions for E2F proteins during a cellular proliferative response including a role for E2F1-3 in the activation of transcription at G1/S and a role for E2F4-8 in repressing the same group of E2F1-3 target genes as cells progress through S phase. We now find that E2F7 and E2F8, which are induced by E2F1-3 at G1/S, can form a heterodimer with E2F1 through interactions involving the DNA-binding domains of the two proteins. In vitro DNA interaction assays demonstrate the formation of an E2F1-E2F7 complex, as well as an E2F7-E2F7 complex on adjacent E2F-binding sites. We also show that E2F7 recruits the co-repressor C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) and that CtBP2 is essential for E2F7 to repress E2F1 transcription. Taken together, these findings suggest a mechanism for the repression of transcription by E2F7."

https://openalex.org/W2051196345,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in the activation of numerous stress responses including oxidative stress, with the potential to induce an apoptotic state. Previously we have shown that HCV attenuates the stress-induced, p38MAPK-mediated up-regulation of the K+ channel Kv2.1, to maintain the survival of infected cells in the face of cellular stress. We demonstrated that this effect was mediated by HCV non-structural 5A (NS5A) protein, which impaired p38MAPK activity through a polyproline motif-dependent interaction, resulting in reduction of phosphorylation activation of Kv2.1. In this study, we investigated the host cell proteins targeted by NS5A to mediate Kv2.1 inhibition. We screened a phage-display library expressing the entire complement of human SH3 domains for novel NS5A-host cell interactions. This analysis identified mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) as a putative NS5A interacting partner. MLK3 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a member of the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family and activates p38MAPK. An NS5A-MLK3 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. We further demonstrate a novel role of MLK3 in the modulation of Kv2.1 activity, whereby MLK3 overexpression leads to the up-regulation of channel activity. Accordingly, coexpression of NS5A suppressed this stimulation. Additionally we demonstrate that overexpression of MLK3 induced apoptosis, which was also counteracted by NS5A.

https://openalex.org/W2004251343,"The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) is a nucleic acid-binding protein that acts as a docking platform integrating signal transduction pathways to nucleic acid-related processes. Given that hnRNPK could be involved in other steps that compose gene expression the definition of its genome-wide occupancy is important to better understand its role in transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to analyze the genome-wide hnRNPK-DNA interaction in colon cancer cell line HCT116. 9.1/3.6 and 7.0/3.4 million tags were sequenced/mapped, then 1809 and 642 hnRNPK binding sites were detected in quiescent and 30-min serum-stimulated cells, respectively. The inspection of sequencing tracks revealed inducible hnRNPK recruitment along a number of immediate early gene loci, including EGR1 and ZFP36, with the highest densities present at the transcription termination sites. Strikingly, hnRNPK knockdown with siRNA resulted in increased pre-RNA levels transcribed downstream of the EGR1 polyadenylation (A) site suggesting altered 3'-end pre-RNA degradation. Further ChIP survey of hnRNPK knockdown uncovered decreased recruitment of the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN2 along EGR1 and downstream of the poly(A) signal without altering RNA polymerase II density at these sites. Immunoprecipitation of hnRNPK and XRN2 from intact and RNase A-treated nuclear extracts followed by shotgun mass spectrometry revealed the presence of hnRNPK and XRN2 in the same complexes along with other spliceosome-related proteins. Our data suggest that hnRNPK may play a role in recruitment of XRN2 to gene loci thus regulating coupling 3'-end pre-mRNA processing to transcription termination."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which extranuclear ER exerts its function are still poorly understood. Here, we report that mediator of ERBB2-driven cell motility (MEMO) regulates extranuclear functions of ER. MEMO physically and functionally interacted with ER. Through its interaction with the growth factor receptors IGF1R and ERBB2, MEMO mediated extranuclear functions of ER, including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B/AKT, two important growth regulatory protein kinases, and integration of function with nuclear ER. Activation of MAPK and AKT was responsible for MEMO modulation of ER phosphorylation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Moreover, MEMO increased anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and was required for estrogen-induced breast tumor growth in nude mice. Together, our studies identified MEMO as a new component of extranuclear ER signalosome and suggest an essential role for MEMO in the regulation of ER-positive breast cancer cell growth."

The Min system is a widely conserved mechanism in bacteria that ensures the correct placement of the division machinery at midcell. MinC is the component of this system that effectively interacts with FtsZ and inhibits the formation of the Z-ring. Here we report that MinC produces a concentration-dependent reduction in the size of GTP-induced FtsZ protofilaments (FtsZ-GTP) as demonstrated by analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Our experiments show that, despite being shorter, FtsZ protofilaments maintain their narrow distribution in size in the presence of MinC. The protein had the same effect regardless of its addition prior to or after FtsZ polymerization.

Using the GTP-regenerating system approach, we have recently shown that under close to physiological conditions, that is nearly neutral pH and 500 mm KCl, FtsZ assembles into a narrow size distribution of protofilaments comprising around 100 subunits in solutions containing 0.3–5 mm Mg2+(16.Monterroso B.

The concerted formation of a narrow distribution of polymers was also observed under these conditions when polymerization was triggered by GMPCPP (16.Monterroso B. Ahijado-Guzmán R. Reija B.

Protofilaments are considered the basic structural unit of the Z-ring, but they are too short to encompass the whole bacterial circumference at midcell. Therefore, protofilaments must assemble into a larger structure to form the Z-ring observed in vivo (17.Fu G. Huang T. Buss J. Coltharp C. Hensel Z. Xiao J.

The mechanism by which this is achieved is not known, although in vitro assembly of protofilaments into several higher order structures has been observed upon addition of crowding agents (12.González J.M.

Experiments with MinC tagged with MalE protein revealed that it inhibits FtsZ-GTP polymer sedimentation, although it does not affect FtsZ GTPase activity (2.Hu Z. Mukherjee A. Pichoff S. Lutkenhaus J. The MinC component of the division site selection system in Escherichia coli interacts with FtsZ to prevent polymerization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Strikingly, GTPase activity was required for MinC inhibition as FtsZ polymerized with slowly or non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs like GMPCPP and GDP/AlF3 was unaffected by this inhibitor (6.Dajkovic A.

Biol. 2008; 18: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MinC from Thermotoga maritima reveals that it is formed by two structural domains connected by a short flexible linker (22.Cordell S.C. Anderson R.E. Löwe J. Crystal structure of the bacterial cell division inhibitor MinC.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2454-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Studies with deletion mutants have revealed that both isolated domains are able to interact with FtsZ and inhibit polymer sedimentation, although the C-terminal domain (MinCC) requires the presence of MinD (23.Shiomi D. Margolin W. The C-terminal domain of MinC inhibits assembly of the Z ring in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MinCC is responsible for MinC oligomerization (probably dimerization) and contains the binding site for MinD as indicated by structural and mutational studies (22.Cordell S.C. Anderson R.E. Löwe J. Crystal structure of the bacterial cell division inhibitor MinC.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2454-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Wu W. Park K.T. Holyoak T. Lutkenhaus J.

Microbiol. 2011; 79: 1515-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vivo and in vitro assays with MinC and FtsZ mutants indicate that MinCC interacts with FtsZ through the last 15 C-terminal amino acids of FtsZ in the presence of MinD (25.Shen B. Lutkenhaus J. The conserved C-terminal tail of FtsZ is required for the septal localization and division inhibitory activity of MinC(C)/MinD.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 410-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study described several mutations in E. coli FtsZ clustering to the H10 α-helix at the interface between two FtsZ molecules that render it resistant to MinCN (26.Shen B. Lutkenhaus J. Examination of the interaction between FtsZ and MinCN in E. coli suggests how MinC disrupts Z rings.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study, it was proposed that MinC severs FtsZ polymers by specifically breaking the interaction between FtsZ and GDP present in polymers and the adjacent FtsZ molecule through this α-helix. A more recent mutational study on Bacillus subtilis FtsZ found mutations that conferred resistance to MinC in a different, more lateral region of FtsZ than in E. coli, suggesting that the MinC inhibition mechanism may be different in this organism (27.Blasios V.

Genetic and biochemical characterization of the MinC-FtsZ interaction in Bacillus subtilis.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60690Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With the aim of obtaining further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of MinC on E. coli FtsZ polymerization, we applied a biophysical approach entailing a combination of methods such as SV, DLS, and FCS that has proven very useful to thoroughly characterize FtsZ polymers (11.Monterroso B.

Previous studies dealing with the effects of MinC on FtsZ polymerization were carried out principally under conditions favoring FtsZ bundling (6.Dajkovic A. Lan G. Sun S.X. Wirtz D. Lutkenhaus J.

Biol. 2008; 18: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26.Shen B. Lutkenhaus J. Examination of the interaction between FtsZ and MinCN in E. coli suggests how MinC disrupts Z rings.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, our study was conducted at nearly neutral pH and moderate ionic strength and Mg2+ concentration, conditions under which single-stranded FtsZ protofilaments are observed. In this way, the effect of MinC on protofilament formation was specifically addressed in a quantitative manner and related with the interaction between the inhibitor and the GDP-bound form of FtsZ, providing crucial details on the molecular basis of MinC function. pWM2688 containing His6-tagged MinC was obtained by amplifying the minC gene with primers 890 (GCGAGCTCTCAAACACGCCAATCGAGC) and 803 (CGGGATCCTCAATTTAACGGTTGAACGG) and cloning it as a SacI-BamHI fragment (sites underlined) into pWM2619 (23.Shiomi D. Margolin W. The C-terminal domain of MinC inhibits assembly of the Z ring in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to render pWM2622 and then into NcoI-BamHI-cleaved pET28a. E. coli FtsZ was purified by the calcium-induced precipitation method (28.Rivas G. López A. Mingorance J. Ferrándiz M.J. Zorrilla S. Minton A.P. Vicente M. Andreu J.M. Magnesium-induced linear self-association of the FtsZ bacterial cell division protein monomer. The primary steps for FtsZ assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11740-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). MinC was produced in an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain harboring pLys and pWM2688 plasmids. Expression was carried out at 30 °C for 3 h in LB medium in the presence of kanamycin and chloramphenicol after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A600 ∼0.6. After cell pelleting, cells were resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, 25 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol and sonicated on ice. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, MinC was purified from the soluble fraction using a protocol adapted from Ref. 29.Okuno T. Ogoh M. Tanina H. Funasaki N. Kogure K. Direct monitoring of interaction between Escherichia coli proteins, MinC and monomeric FtsZ, in solution.Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2009; 32: 1473-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar that includes two chromatographic steps, anion exchange chromatography and immobilized metal affinity chromatography. MinC was eluted from the affinity column using 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol. Fractions were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were desalted in a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol; frozen; and stored at −80 °C. Before each experiment, MinC fractions were thawed and dialyzed against the desired buffer. FtsZ was covalently labeled in the amine groups with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester dye (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) as described elsewhere (30.Reija B. Monterroso B. Jiménez M. Vicente M. Rivas G. Zorrilla S. Development of a homogeneous fluorescence anisotropy assay to monitor and measure FtsZ assembly in solution.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 418: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The degree of labeling, estimated from the molar absorption coefficients of the protein and the dye, was typically 30–50%. MinC was covalently labeled in the amine groups with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester dyes (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 min at room temperature at pH 7.5 with a 2-fold molar excess of dye with respect to the protein. The degree of labeling, calculated using the molar absorption coefficients of the protein and the dyes, was 30–40%. To analyze the effect of MinC on FtsZ protofilaments, samples were equilibrated in T500 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5 mm MgCl2) or T100 buffer (the same as T500 but with 100 mm KCl instead). 1 mm GTP or 0.4–1 mm GMPCPP was added to trigger polymerization. Unless otherwise stated, FtsZ-GTP polymers were kept in solution for at least 1 h by using an enzymatic GTP-regenerating system (RS; 15 mm acetyl phosphate, 2 units/ml acetate kinase) (12.González J.M. Jiménez M. Vélez M. Mingorance J. Andreu J.M. Vicente M. Rivas G. Essential cell division protein FtsZ assembles into one monomer-thick ribbons under conditions resembling the crowded intracellular environment.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This technique was used to assess MinC homogeneity and oligomerization in the absence of FtsZ, to measure the effect of MinC on FtsZ polymer size, and to monitor the binding of MinC to the polymers. Samples were equilibrated in T500 or T100 buffer. In experiments where FtsZ polymers were present, MinC and FtsZ were mixed prior to starting polymerization, which was then promoted with the addition of GTP + RS or with GMPCPP. SV experiments were carried out at 48,000 rpm in an XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.) equipped with UV-visible and interference detection systems. Sedimentation profiles were registered by interference or, when labeled MinC was present, by absorbance at the adequate wavelength. The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by least square boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the c(s) method as implemented in SEDFIT (31.Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). To be able to compare the effect of MinC on the sedimentation properties of FtsZ protofilaments in different conditions, s values of protofilaments were normalized as follows, snorm=1−s0−sls0−su(Eq.1) where si and s0 represent the experimental s value of the polymer peak in the presence and absence of MinC, respectively, and su corresponds to the s value of fully unassembled FtsZ in the corresponding buffer conditions: 2.7 S for T500 buffer and 2.8 S for T100 buffer. An snorm value of 1.0 corresponds to an s value equal to that of the protofilament peak in the absence of MinC, whereas an snorm value of 0 represents an s value equal to that of the FtsZ monomer peak. MinC concentration values at which half of the maximum change in the s value is achieved (C½) were calculated using the empirical Hill equation described below for FCS data (Equation 4). Sedimentation equilibrium (SE) was used to assess the MinC association state in the absence of FtsZ and to study the binding of labeled MinC to FtsZ-GDP. Buffer and sample conditions were similar to those used for sedimentation velocity. Short column (85 μl) SE was carried out at multiple speeds (from 9000 to 14,000 rpm), and the corresponding scans were recorded at 230 and 280 nm for unlabeled MinC, 450–500 nm for MinC labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (MinC-Alexa 488), and 600–650 nm for MinC labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (MinC-Alexa 647). After the equilibrium scans, a high speed centrifugation run (48,000 rpm) was done to estimate the corresponding base-line offsets. Whole-cell apparent weight average buoyant molecular weight for each sample (FtsZ, MinC, and mixtures) was determined by fitting a single species model to the experimental data using the HeteroAnalysis program (32.Cole J.L. Analysis of heterogeneous interactions.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein molecular weights were calculated from the experimental buoyant mass using theoretical partial specific volumes and buffer densities calculated with SEDNTERP software (33.Laue T. Shah B. Ridgeway T. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). This technique was used to monitor the binding of FtsZ labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (FtsZ-Alexa 488) to MinC. Measurements were performed on a PC1 photon counting steady-state spectrofluorometer (ISS, Inc.) regulated at 20 °C using 3 × 3-mm quartz cuvettes (Hellma Hispania or Starna Scientific). The anisotropy was repeatedly measured for each sample, and the average of at least 8–10 values, obtained after reaching equilibration, was calculated. Binding isotherms were built by titration of MinC into solutions containing a fixed 0.69 μm concentration of FtsZ-Alexa 488. Results presented correspond to the average of at least three independent measurements. Analysis of the binding isotherm was conducted using BIOEQS software (34.Rosales T. Royer C.A. A graphical user interface for BIOEQS: a program for simulating and analyzing complex biomolecular interactions.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 381: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which allows calculation of the free energy of formation of complexes from their free elements by using a numerical solver engine. Errors in the fitting parameters were calculated by rigorous confidence limit testing at the 67% confidence level using this software. FCS was used to monitor titrations of FtsZ-GTP polymers with MinC to obtain a C½ value and to study the binding of fluorescently labeled MinC to FtsZ polymers. FCS measurements were performed under two-photon excitation using a Microtime 200 system (PicoQuant) essentially as described elsewhere (30.Reija B. Monterroso B. Jiménez M. Vicente M. Rivas G. Zor"
https://openalex.org/W1980812314,"Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2) facilitates the movement of the peptidyl tRNA-mRNA complex from the A site of the ribosome to the P site during protein synthesis. ADP-ribosylation (ADP(R)) of eEF2 by bacterial toxins on a unique diphthamide residue inhibits its translocation activity, but the mechanism is unclear. We have employed a hormone-inducible diphtheria toxin (DT) expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which allows for the rapid induction of ADP(R)-eEF2 to examine the effects of DT in vivo. ADP(R) of eEF2 resulted in a decrease in total protein synthesis consistent with a defect in translation elongation. Association of eEF2 with polyribosomes, however, was unchanged upon expression of DT. Upon prolonged exposure to DT, cells with an abnormal morphology and increased DNA content accumulated. This observation was specific to DT expression and was not observed when translation elongation was inhibited by other methods. Examination of these cells by electron microscopy indicated a defect in cell separation following mitosis. These results suggest that expression of proteins late in the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to inhibition by ADP(R)-eEF2."

https://openalex.org/W1998356414,"In order to establish long-lasting infections in their mammalian host, filarial nematodes have developed sophisticated strategies to dampen their host's immune response. Proteins that are actively secreted by the parasites have been shown to induce the expansion of regulatory T cells and to directly interfere with effector T cell function. Here, we analyze the suppressive capacity of Onchocercavolvulus-derived excreted/secreted proteins. Addition of two recombinant O. volvulus proteins, abundant larval transcript-2 (OvALT-2) and novel larval transcript-1 (OvNLT-1) to cell cultures of T cell receptor transgenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells suppressed antigen-specific stimulation in vitro. Ovalbumin-specific CD4(+) DO11.10 and OT-II T cells that had been stimulated with their cognate antigen in the presence of OvALT-2 or OvNLT-1 displayed reduced DNA synthesis quantified by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and reduced cell division quantified by CFSE dilution. Furthermore, the IL-2 and IFN-γ response of ovalbumin-specific CD8(+) OT-I T cells was suppressed by OvALT-2 and OvNLT-1. In contrast, another recombinant O. volvulus protein, microfilariae surface-associated antigen (Ov103), did not modulate T cell activation, thus serving as internal control for non-ESP-mediated artifacts. Suppressive capacity of the identified ESP was associated with induction of apoptosis in T cells demonstrated by increased exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. Of note, the digestion of recombinant proteins with proteinase K did not abolish the suppression of antigen-specific proliferation although the suppressive capacity of the identified excreted/secreted products was not mediated by low molecular weight contaminants in the undigested preparations. In summary, we identified two suppressive excreted/secreted products from O. volvulus, which interfere with the function of antigen-specific T cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2052632576,"In pancreatic β-cells, glucose induces the binding of the transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) to the insulin gene promoter to activate insulin gene transcription. At low glucose levels, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is known to phosphorylate PDX-1 on C-terminal serine residues, which triggers PDX-1 proteasomal degradation. We previously showed that the serine/threonine Per-Arnt-Sim domain-containing kinase (PASK) regulates insulin gene transcription via PDX-1. However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation are unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the role of PASK in the regulation of PDX-1 phosphorylation, protein expression, and stability in insulin-secreting cells and isolated rodent islets of Langerhans. We observed that glucose induces a decrease in overall PDX-1 serine phosphorylation and that overexpression of WT PASK mimics this effect. In vitro, PASK directly phosphorylates GSK3β on its inactivating phosphorylation site Ser(9). Overexpression of a kinase-dead (KD), dominant negative version of PASK blocks glucose-induced Ser(9) phosphorylation of GSK3β. Accordingly, GSK3β Ser(9) phosphorylation is reduced in islets from pask-null mice. Overexpression of WT PASK or KD GSK3β protects PDX-1 from degradation and results in increased PDX-1 protein abundance. Conversely, overexpression of KD PASK blocks glucose-induction of PDX-1 protein. We conclude that PASK phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β, thereby preventing PDX-1 serine phosphorylation and alleviating GSK3β-mediated PDX-1 protein degradation in pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077002813,"In acute and chronic neurodegeneration, Ca(2+) mishandling and disruption of the cytoskeleton compromise neuronal integrity, yet abnormalities in the signaling roles of cytoskeletal proteins remain largely unexplored. We now report that the microtubule-associated protein p600 (also known as UBR4) promotes neuronal survival. Following depletion of p600, glutamate-induced Ca(2+) influx through NMDA receptors, but not AMPA receptors, initiates a degenerative process characterized by endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Downstream of NMDA receptors, p600 associates with the calmodulin·calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα complex. A direct and atypical p600/calmodulin interaction is required for neuronal survival. Thus, p600 counteracts specific Ca(2+)-induced death pathways through regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis and signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1992179372,"Most conditions detected by expanded newborn screening result from deficiency of one of the enzymes that degrade acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters in mitochondria. The role of acyl-CoAs in the pathophysiology of these disorders is poorly understood, in part because CoA esters are intracellular and samples are not generally available from human patients. We created a mouse model of one such condition, deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL), in liver (HLLKO mice). HL catalyses a reaction of ketone body synthesis and of leucine degradation. Chronic HL deficiency and acute crises each produced distinct abnormal liver acyl-CoA patterns, which would not be predictable from levels of urine organic acids and plasma acylcarnitines. In HLLKO hepatocytes, ketogenesis was undetectable. Carboxylation of [2-(14)C] pyruvate diminished following incubation of HLLKO hepatocytes with the leucine metabolite 2-ketoisocaproate (KIC). HLLKO mice also had suppression of the normal hyperglycemic response to a systemic pyruvate load, a measure of gluconeogenesis. Hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia, cardinal features of many inborn errors of acyl-CoA metabolism, occurred spontaneously in some HLLKO mice and were inducible by administering KIC. KIC loading also increased levels of several leucine-related acyl-CoAs and reduced acetyl-CoA levels. Ultrastructurally, hepatocyte mitochondria of KIC-treated HLLKO mice show marked swelling. KIC-induced hyperammonemia improved following administration of carglumate (N-carbamyl-L-glutamic acid), which substitutes for the product of an acetyl-CoA-dependent reaction essential for urea cycle function, demonstrating an acyl-CoA-related mechanism for this complication."

In the present study, Humanin increased the mRNA and protein expression of SH3 domain-binding protein 5 (SH3BP5), which has been known to be a JNK interactor, in neuronal cells. Similar to Humanin treatment, overexpression of SH3BP5 inhibited AD-related neuronal death, while siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous SH3BP5 expression attenuated the neuroprotective effect of Humanin. These results indicate that SH3BP5 is a downstream effector of Humanin. Furthermore, biochemical analysis has revealed that SH3BP5 binds to JNK and directly inhibits JNK through its two putative mitogen-activated protein kinase interaction motifs (KIMs)."
https://openalex.org/W1979914953,"RUNX3, a runt-related transcription factor, has a crucial role in dorsal root ganglion neurogenesis. Recent studies have suggested that RUNX3 acts as a tumor suppressor in stomach, colon and breast cancer. However, the biological role of RUNX3 in neuroblastoma remains elusive. Here we report that high levels of RUNX3 expression contribute to the favorable outcome in patients with neuroblastoma, whereas low levels of RUNX3 expression result in poor outcome. Array-based analysis suggested that the allelic loss at chromosome 1p36 is one of the reasons why expression of RUNX3 is downregulated in advanced neuroblastomas. Interestingly, the several patients survived from neuroblastoma with both high mRNA expressions of MYCN and RUNX3, suggesting that RUNX3 high expression might overcome the aggressive behavior of MYCN. Exogenous expression of RUNX3 strongly inhibits cell proliferation and migration in neuroblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, RUNX3 reduces the stability of MYCN protein in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, and this RUNX3-mediated MYCN degradation may depend on the physical interaction between RUNX3 and MYCN. Thus, our findings provide a tumor-suppressing mechanism by which RUNX3 inhibits the MYCN activity in neuroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2008328260,"Ricin belongs to the type II ribosome-inactivating proteins that depurinate the universally conserved α-sarcin loop of rRNA. The RNA N-glycosidase activity of ricin also largely depends on the ribosomal proteins that play an important role during the process of rRNA depurination. Therefore, the study of the interaction between ricin and the ribosomal elements will be better to understand the catalysis mechanism of ricin. The antibody 6C2 is a mouse monoclonal antibody exhibiting unusually potent neutralizing ability against ricin, but the neutralization mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report the 2.8 Å crystal structure of 6C2 Fab in complex with the A-chain of ricin (RTA), which reveals an extensive antigen-antibody interface that contains both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. The complementarity-determining region loops H1, H2, H3, and L3 form a pocket to accommodate the epitope on the RTA (residues Asp96–Thr116). ELISA results show that Gln98, Glu99, Glu102, and Thr105 (RTA) are the key residues that play an important role in recognizing 6C2. With the perturbation of the 6C2 Fab-RTA interface, 6C2 loses its neutralization ability, measured based on the inhibition of protein synthesis in a cell-free system. Finally, we propose that the neutralization mechanism of 6C2 against ricin is that the binding of 6C2 hinders the interaction between RTA and the ribosome and the surface plasmon resonance and pulldown results confirm our hypothesis. In short, our data explain the neutralization mechanism of mAb 6C2 against ricin and provide a structural basis for the development of improved antibody drugs with better specificity and higher affinity.Background: The antibody 6C2 exhibited an unusually potent neutralizing ability against ricin.Results: We determined the crystal structure of 6C2 Fab in complex with RTA and mapped the epitope on RTA.Conclusion: The binding of 6C2 hinders the interaction between RTA and the ribosome, thus inhibiting the activities of RTA.Significance: Our findings further confirm the role of ribosomal elements in ricin activity and specificity.

https://openalex.org/W2101155550,"Corneal dystrophies are genetic disorders resulting in progressive corneal clouding due to the deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from keratoepithelin, also called transforming growth factor β-induced protein (TGFBI). The formation of amyloid fibrils is often accelerated by surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Most eye drops contain benzalkonium chloride (BAC), a cationic surfactant, as a preservative substance. In the present study, we aimed to reveal the role of BAC in the amyloid fibrillation of keratoepithelin-derived peptides in vitro. We used three types of 22-residue synthetic peptides covering Leu110-Glu131 of the keratoepithelin sequence: an R-type peptide with wild-type R124, a C-type peptide with C124 associated with lattice corneal dystrophy type I, and a H-type peptide with H124 associated with granular corneal dystrophy type II. The time courses of spontaneous amyloid fibrillation and seed-dependent fibril elongation were monitored in the presence of various concentrations of BAC or SDS using thioflavin T fluorescence. BAC and SDS accelerated the fibrillation of all synthetic peptides in the absence and presence of seeds. Optimal acceleration occurred near the CMC, which suggests that the unstable and dynamic interactions of keratoepithelin peptides with amphipathic surfactants led to the formation of fibrils. These results suggest that eye drops containing BAC may deteriorate corneal dystrophies and that those without BAC are preferred especially for patients with corneal dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W2048825451,"Kainate receptors (KARs) are one of the ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) with characteristically slow kinetics. Although mechanisms for the slow kinetics of KAR-EPSCs are not totally understood, recent evidence has implicated a regulatory role of KAR-associated proteins. Here, we report that decay kinetics of GluK2a-containing receptors is modulated by closely associated 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 binding requires PKC-dependent phosphorylation of serine residues localized in the carboxyl tail of the GluK2a subunit. In transfected cells, 14-3-3 binding to GluK2a slows desensitization kinetics of both homomeric GluK2a and heteromeric GluK2a/GluK5 receptors. Moreover, KAR-EPSCs at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses decay significantly faster in the 14-3-3 functional knock-out mice. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins are an important regulator of GluK2a-containing KARs and may contribute to the slow decay kinetics of native KAR-EPSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2074087098,"Estrogen receptor (ER) β1 and ERα have overlapping and distinct functions despite their common use of estradiol as the physiological ligand. These attributes are explained in part by their differential utilization of coregulators and ligands. Although Tip60 has been shown to interact with both receptors, its regulatory role in ERβ1 transactivation has not been defined. In this study, we found that Tip60 enhances transactivation of ERβ1 at the AP-1 site but suppresses its transcriptional activity at the estrogen-response element (ERE) site in an estradiol-independent manner. However, different estrogenic compounds can modify the Tip60 action. The corepressor activity of Tip60 at the ERE site is abolished by diarylpropionitrile, genistein, equol, and bisphenol A, whereas its coactivation at the AP-1 site is augmented by fulvestrant (ICI 182,780). GRIP1 is an important tethering mediator for ERs at the AP-1 site. We found that coexpression of GRIP1 synergizes the action of Tip60. Although Tip60 is a known acetyltransferase, it is unable to acetylate ERβ1, and its coregulatory functions are independent of its acetylation activity. In addition, we showed the co-occupancy of ERβ1 and Tip60 at ERE and AP-1 sites of ERβ1 target genes. Tip60 differentially regulates the endogenous expression of the target genes by modulating the binding of ERβ1 to the cis-regulatory regions. Thus, we have identified Tip60 as the first dual-function coregulator of ERβ1."
https://openalex.org/W1966620997,"Cytokine modulation of the endothelium is considered an important contributor to the inflammation response. TNFα is an early response gene during the initiation of inflammation. However, the detailed mechanism by which TNFα induces proinflammatory gene expression is not completely understood. In this report, we demonstrate that silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) represses the expression of a subset of TNFα target genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Upon TNFα stimulation, we observed an increase in the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP1 and a decrease in SMRT protein levels. We show that β-TrCP1 interacts with SMRT in a phosphorylation-independent manner and cooperates with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D2 to promote ubiquitination-dependent SMRT degradation. Knockdown of β-TrCP1 increases SMRT protein accumulation, increases SMRT association with its targeted promoters, and decreases SMRT target gene expression. Taken together, our results support a model in which TNFα-induced β-TrCP1 accumulation promotes SMRT degradation and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory gene expression."
