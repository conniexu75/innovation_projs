https://openalex.org/W2037393136,"Apoptotic cells expose phosphatidylserine and are swiftly engulfed by macrophages. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (EGF) factor 8 (MFG-E8) is a protein that binds to apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine and that enhances the engulfment of apoptotic cells by macrophages. We report that tingible body macrophages in the germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes strongly express MFG-E8. Many apoptotic lymphocytes were found on the MFG-E8 –/– tingible body macrophages, but they were not efficiently engulfed. The MFG-E8 –/– mice developed splenomegaly, with the formation of numerous germinal centers, and suffered from glomerulonephritis as a result of autoantibody production. These data demonstrate that MFG-E8 has a critical role in removing apoptotic B cells in the germinal centers and that its failure can lead to autoimmune diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1977825177,"Little is known of the molecular mechanisms whereby spermatogonia, mitotic germ cells of the testis, self-renew and differentiate into sperm. Here we show that Zfp145, encoding the transcriptional repressor Plzf, has a crucial role in spermatogenesis. Zfp145 expression was restricted to gonocytes and undifferentiated spermatogonia and was absent in tubules of W/W(v) mutants that lack these cells. Mice lacking Zfp145 underwent a progressive loss of spermatogonia with age, associated with increases in apoptosis and subsequent loss of tubule structure but without overt differentiation defects or loss of the supporting Sertoli cells. Spermatogonial transplantation experiments revealed a depletion of spermatogonial stem cells in the adult. Microarray analysis of isolated spermatogonia from Zfp145-null mice before testis degeneration showed alterations in the expression profile of genes associated with spermatogenesis. These results identify Plzf as a spermatogonia-specific transcription factor in the testis that is required to regulate self-renewal and maintenance of the stem cell pool."
https://openalex.org/W2073738799,"Adult germline stem cells are capable of self-renewal, tissue regeneration and production of large numbers of differentiated progeny. We show here that the classical mouse mutant luxoid affects adult germline stem cell self-renewal. Young homozygous luxoid mutant mice produce limited numbers of normal spermatozoa and then progressively lose their germ line after birth. Transplantation studies showed that germ cells from mutant mice did not colonize recipient testes, suggesting that the defect is intrinsic to the stem cells. We determined that the luxoid mutant contains a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding Plzf, a transcriptional repressor that regulates the epigenetic state of undifferentiated cells, and showed that Plzf is coexpressed with Oct4 in undifferentiated spermatogonia. This is the first gene shown to be required in germ cells for stem cell self-renewal in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2146655366,"The thin basal and oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons receive most of the synaptic inputs from other cells, but their integrative properties remain uncertain. Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration. Our findings could have important implications for the computing and memory-related functions of cortical tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2140960450,"We used molecular markers to study genetic relationships in a diverse collection of 85 domestic dog breeds. Differences among breeds accounted for ∼30% of genetic variation. Microsatellite genotypes were used to correctly assign 99% of individual dogs to breeds. Phylogenetic analysis separated several breeds with ancient origins from the remaining breeds with modern European origins. We identified four genetic clusters, which predominantly contained breeds with similar geographic origin, morphology, or role in human activities. These results provide a genetic classification of dog breeds and will aid studies of the genetics of phenotypic breed differences."
https://openalex.org/W2037444091,"Facing the consequence of a decision we made can trigger emotions like satisfaction, relief, or regret, which reflect our assessment of what was gained as compared to what would have been gained by making a different decision. These emotions are mediated by a cognitive process known as counterfactual thinking. By manipulating a simple gambling task, we characterized a subject's choices in terms of their anticipated and actual emotional impact. Normal subjects reported emotional responses consistent with counterfactual thinking; they chose to minimize future regret and learned from their emotional experience. Patients with orbitofrontal cortical lesions, however, did not report regret or anticipate negative consequences of their choices. The orbitofrontal cortex has a fundamental role in mediating the experience of regret."
https://openalex.org/W2062173234,"Pathogenic mycobacteria resist lysosomal delivery after uptake into macrophages, allowing them to survive intracellularly. We found that the eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase G from pathogenic mycobacteria was secreted within macrophage phagosomes, inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion and mediating intracellular survival of mycobacteria. Inactivation of protein kinase G by gene disruption or chemical inhibition resulted in lysosomal localization and mycobacterial cell death in infected macrophages. Besides identifying a target for the control of mycobacterial infections, these findings suggest that pathogenic mycobacteria have evolved eukaryotic-like signal transduction mechanisms capable of modulating host cell trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2015052870,"Histone acetylation is a diagnostic feature of transcriptionally active genes. The proper recruitment and function of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), is a key regulatory step for gene expression and cell cycle. Functional defects of either of these enzymes may lead to several diseases, including cancer. HATs and HDACs thus are potential therapeutic targets. Here we report that garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone derivative from Garcinia indica fruit rind, is a potent inhibitor of histone acetyltransferases p300 (IC$_{50}$~7\mu M) and PCAF (IC$_{50}$~5\mu M) both in vitro and in vivo. The kinetic analysis shows that it is a mixed type of inhibitor with an increased affinity for PCAF as compared to p300. HAT activity dependent chromatin transcription was strongly inhibited by garcinol, whereas transcription from DNA template was not affected. Furthermore, it was found to be a potent inducer of apoptosis, and it alters(predominantly down regulates) the global gene expression in HeLa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2099224719,"Tyrosine phosphorylation, regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and kinases (PTKs), is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. A mutational analysis of the tyrosine phosphatase gene superfamily in human cancers identified 83 somatic mutations in six PTPs ( PTPRF, PTPRG, PTPRT, PTPN3, PTPN13, PTPN14 ), affecting 26% of colorectal cancers and a smaller fraction of lung, breast, and gastric cancers. Fifteen mutations were nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site alterations predicted to result in truncated proteins lacking phosphatase activity. Five missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTP ( PTPRT ) were biochemically examined and found to reduce phosphatase activity. Expression of wild-type but not a mutant PTPRT in human cancer cells inhibited cell growth. These observations suggest that the mutated tyrosine phosphatases are tumor suppressor genes, regulating cellular pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W1979949363,"Anisotropic (direction-dependent) long-distance dispersal (LDD) by wind has been invoked to explain the strong floristic affinities shared among landmasses in the Southern Hemisphere. Its contribution has not yet been systematically tested because of the previous lack of global data on winds. We used global winds coverage from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration SeaWinds scatterometer to test whether floristic similarities of Southern Hemisphere moss, liverwort, lichen, and pteridophyte floras conform better with (i) the anisotropic LDD hypothesis, which predicts that connection by “wind highways” increases floristic similarities, or (ii) a direction-independent LDD hypothesis, which predicts that floristic similarities among sites increase with geographic proximity. We found a stronger correlation of floristic similarities with wind connectivity than with geographic proximities, which supports the idea that wind is a dispersal vehicle for many organisms in the Southern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2013112316,"The protein-remodeling factor Hsp104 governs inheritance of [ PSI + ], a yeast prion formed by self-perpetuating amyloid conformers of the translation termination factor Sup35. Perplexingly, either excess or insufficient Hsp104 eliminates [ PSI + ]. In vitro, at low concentrations, Hsp104 catalyzed the formation of oligomeric intermediates that proved critical for the nucleation of Sup 35 fibrillization de novo and displayed a conformation common among amyloidogenic polypeptides. At higher Hsp104 concentrations, amyloidogenic oligomerization and contingent fibrillization were abolished. Hsp104 also disassembled mature fibers in a manner that initially exposed new surfaces for conformational replication but eventually exterminated prion conformers. These Hsp104 activities differed in their reaction mechanism and can explain [ PSI + ] inheritance patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2028705859,"We have previously shown that two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors (TNFR) exhibit antagonistic functions during neurodegenerative processes in vivo with TNFR1 aggravating and TNFR2 reducing neuronal cell loss, respectively. To elucidate the neuroprotective signaling pathways of TNFR2, we investigated glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. TNF-expressing neurons from TNF-transgenic mice were found to be strongly protected from glutamate-induced apoptosis. Neurons from wild type and TNFR1-/- mice prestimulated with TNF or agonistic TNFR2-specific antibodies were also resistant to excitotoxicity, whereas TNFR2-/- neurons died upon glutamate and/or TNF exposures. Both protein kinase B/Akt and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation were apparent upon TNF treatment. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 induced the NF-κB pathway, yet with distinguishable kinetics and upstream activating components, TNFR1 only induced transient NF-κB activation, whereas TNFR2 facilitated long term phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent NF-κB activation strictly. Glutamate-induced triggering of the ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor was required for the enhanced and persistent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent NF-κB activation by TNFR2, indicating a positive cooperation of TNF and neurotransmitter-induced signal pathways. TNFR2-induced persistent NF-κB activity was essential for neuronal survival. Thus, the duration of NF-κB activation is a critical determinant for sensitivity toward excitotoxic stress and is dependent on a differential upstream signal pathway usage of the two TNFRs.

Up-regulated TNF expression has also been found in various neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral malaria, AIDS dementia, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, suggesting a potential pathogenic role of TNF in these diseases as well (3Lou J. Lucas R. Grau G.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 810-820Google Scholar, 4Tyor W.R. Wesselingh S.L. Griffin J.W. McArthur J.C. Griffin D.E. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum.

The membrane-expressed form of TNF signals through both TNF receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2), whereas soluble TNF proteolytically cleaved from the membrane form acts mainly via TNFR1 (8Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Google Scholar). Signal pathways initiated from the death domain-containing TNFR1, leading to both proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic cellular responses, have been studied in great detail (9Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Google Scholar). In contrast, there is less information regarding the molecular mechanisms surrounding signal pathways and cellular responses solely initiated via TNFR2 because of concomitant TNFR1 signals in normal situations. The evaluation of the physiological role of TNFR2 by large depends on data obtained from TNFR1-/- mice. We have recently investigated the role of TNF and its receptors in retinal ischemia and unraveled an antagonistic function of TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR2 exerts neuroprotection in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent manner, which is counterbalanced by the neurodegenerative action of TNFR1 (10Fontaine V. Mohand-Said S. Hanoteau N. Fuchs C. Pfizenmaier K. Eisel U. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1-7Google Scholar). TNFR1 has also been associated with the cell death of hippocampal neurons responding to TNF (11Yang L. Lindholm K. Konishi Y. Li R. Shen Y. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3025-3032Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of TNFR2 expression by the use of antisense oligonucleotides sensitized neuronal-like cells toward apoptosis (12Shen Y. Li R. Shiosaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3550-3553Google Scholar). To elucidate the neuroprotective signal pathways emanating from TNFR2, we have established an in vitro model of apoptosis induction of primary cortical neurons by glutamate-triggered excitotoxicity to study mechanisms controlling apoptosis sensitivity of neurons within wild type (C57BL/6) and TNF transgenic TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- mice. Our data reveal, for the first time, differential activation kinetics of NF-κB and differential usage of upstream signaling components by TNFR1 and TNFR2. TNFR2, but not TNFR1, induces persistent NF-κB activation via a signaling pathway involving PI3K and PKB/Akt, which is strongly enhanced by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor co-stimulation. Generation of Transgenic Mice with Brain-specific TNF Expression—Transgenic mice were developed by pronuclear injection in general as previously described (13Eisel U. Reynolds K. Riddick M. Zimmer A. Niemann H. Zimmer A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3365-3372Google Scholar). A construct consisting of the murine NMDAR subunit 2B (NR2B) promoter and the first three exons of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the NR2B gene was fused with the NarI site of the first exon of the murine TNF gene with the replaced 3′-UTR (3′ part of exon 4 of the TNF gene) by the 3′-UTR of the human β-globin gene (14Keffer J. Probert L. Cazlaris H. Georgopoulos S. Kaslaris E. Kioussis D. Kollias G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4025-4031Google Scholar). Four mouse lines were investigated and showed similar TNF expression patterns differing only in the level of and duration of expression. The expression pattern was verified by in situ hybridization as described previously (15Klein M. Pieri I. Uhlmann F. Pfizenmaier K. Eisel U. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 259-269Google Scholar). The pBSII-SK plasmid containing a cDNA of the murine TNF gene was digested either with PstI or EcoRI for synthesis of a 35S-labeled sense or antisense probe using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. Primary Cortical Cell Culture—Cortical cultures were prepared as follows. Embryonic brains were extracted (embryonic day 14), the meninges were removed, and the cortices were dissected immediately. Neurons were recovered by mechanical dissociation. Cells were plated at a density of ∼1 × 105 cells/cm2 (96- or 6-well plates) or 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 (24-well plates) on poly-l-lysine (Sigma) coated plates. Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mm glutamine with a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma) was used as culture medium. On the second day in vitro, cells were treated with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside for 48 h to inhibit non-neuronal cell growth. Subsequently, the medium was completely exchanged, and every third day afterward, fresh medium was added. Cells were either stimulated with increasing concentrations of glutamate for 1 h (Figs. 2B, 3, A and C, and 8C) or for 24 h with the indicated concentrations of TNF (Figs. 3B and 8, A and B) or TNFR agonistic antibodies (Fig. 4, A-C) followed by a 1-h stimulation of 250 μm glutamate (Sigma) and the determination of the cell viability 24 h later. When indicated, cells were incubated prior to the glutamate stimulus with an inhibitor of PI3K (LY294002 (25 μm), Calbiochem, or wortmannin (100 nm), Sigma), NMDAR (MK801 (10 μm), Tocris), caspases (Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm), BACHEM), or NF-κB (MG-132 (20 μm), Calbiochem; geldanamycin (0.5 μm), Calbiochem; or BAY11-7082 (20 μm), Alexis Biochemicals). To determine the kinetics of cell death induction, primary cortical neurons were incubated for 1 h with 250 and 500 μm glutamate and cell viability was assessed directly after the stimulus (=1-h) or 1 (=2-h), 3 (=4-h), 5 (=6-h), and 23 (=24-h total incubation time) h later (Fig. 2A). Agonistic antibodies (2 μg/μl; HyCult Biotechnology) were cross-linked by a mouse anti-rat antibody (2 μg/μl; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) to obtain optimum triggering of the TNFRs.Fig. 3TNF mediates anti-apoptotic signals via TNFR2.A, differences in sensitivity for glutamate-induced excitotoxicity of primary cortical neurons from different mouse lines in the absence (open symbols) or presence (filled symbols) of the NMDAR blocker MK801 (□ and ▪, wild type (WT); ▵ and ▴, NR2B/TNF; ○ and •, TNFR1-/- (R1-/-); ⋄ and ♦, TNFR2-/- (R2-/-)).

J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Google Scholar). Primary cortical neurons were grown in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well and stimulated as indicated. 10 μl of an MTT solution (1.25 mg/ml) was added to each well. After a 1-h incubation, cells were lysed by adding 150 μl of isopropyl-HCl solution (600 μl of HCl/100 ml isopropyl alcohol) for 15 min. The absorbance of each well was determined with an automated ELISA reader (Bio-Rad) at 590 nm with a background correction at 620 nm. Western Blot—Cytosolic extracts from primary cortical neurons (2 × 106) were prepared by washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by the addition of 0.4 ml of the cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min. 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added for 2 min, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer (2% SDS, 5% DTT), and 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences), proteins were detected with a specific primary and a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (LuminGlo, New England Biolabs). Primary antibodies included were a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for the phospho-PKB/Akt serine 473 residue (1:1000; Cell Signaling), total PKB/Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling), IκB (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-IκB (1:1000; Cell Signaling), TNF (1:1000; BIOSOURCE), and glutamate receptor 1 (1:300; Chemicon). Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS. Overnight incubation with a polyclonal rabbit anti-p65 antibody (1:500; Oncogene) or rabbit anti-TNF antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C was followed by a 1-h incubation with a fluorescent-labeled Alexa 546 or 488 anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes) at room temperature. Neurons were labeled with a monoclonal neuronal-specific mouse anti-unique-β-tubulin antibody (1:2000; Babco) for 1.5 h at room temperature and a Alexa 488 or 546 anti-mouse antibody (1:1000). Glia cells were detected using a monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein antibody (1:2000; Sigma) and a secondary Alexa 546-labeled anti-mouse antibody (1:1000). The glia cell content resulted in <0.5%. Determination of apoptosis induction was assessed after fixation of stimulated (1 h 250 μm glutamate) and unstimulated cells by incubation with an annexin V-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (1:20; BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature followed by a 1-h incubation with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml) for nuclear staining, For immunohistochemical staining, paraffin-embedded sections were permeabilized with 0.02% H2O2-methanol for 30 min and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum for 20 min. Sections then were incubated with specific antibodies (rabbit-anti-TNF (Genzyme) at 1:1000; rat-antimac3 (BD Biosciences) at 1:200; and rat-anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences) at 1:100 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline) at 4 °C overnight, washed, incubated with a biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or anti-rat-IgG (Vector Laboratories at 1:200 in 2.5% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline), and stained with avidin-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For preparation of nuclear extracts, 2 × 106 primary cortical neurons were washed once with cold PBS, resuspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then incubated on ice for 20 min. Subsequently, 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added for 2 min, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, shaken for 20 min, and then centrifuged. The supernatant containing nuclear proteins was used for EMSA. The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Binding reaction was performed by incubating 10 μg of nuclear protein extracts with 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 5 mm MgCl2,50mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm/μl) was added for 20 min at room temperature. Binding specificity was determined by competition with excess (100 ng) unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. DNA/protein complexes were analyzed on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by PhosphorImaging. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with p65, p50, or cRel antibodies (1 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. Generation and Analyses of NR2B/TNF Transgenic Mice—Previous transgenic mouse models resolving the role of TNF in the brain were designed to cause a widespread and often high level of TNF expression, which was typically associated with various pathologies (17Probert L.

Bauer J. Akassoglou K. Lassmann H. Kollias G. Probert L. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 912-917Google Scholar). To avoid unconditional TNF expression, we have employed the promoter of the murine NMDA receptor subunit NR2B gene to generate mice with a strictly regional and rather moderate neuronal TNF expression. The endogenous expression of NR2B subunit is restricted to forebrain regions and mainly expressed in cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain (21Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. J. Comp. Neurol. 1993; 338: 377-390Google Scholar, 22Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Google Scholar). To enforce this restricted expression pattern of TNF in transgenic mice, the 5′-UTR of the NR2B gene, which was shown to influence the expression pattern, was also included in the construct (Fig. 1A) (20Kassiotis G. Bauer J. Akassoglou K. Lassmann H. Kollias G. Probert L. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 912-917Google Scholar, 23Sasner M. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21316-21322Google Scholar). NR2B-directed TNF transgene expression was verified by in situ hybridization (Fig. 1B), Western blot analyses in embryonic day 14 and postnatal day 14 tissues (Fig. 1C), immunolabeling of primary neuronal cells (Fig. 1, D and E), and immunostaining in paraffin sections (Fig. 1F, upper panel). Interestingly, among the four generated mouse lines, no inflammatory responses such as infiltration or spontaneous demyelinating lesions were observed as reported from other mouse models with ubiquitous and high level of TNF expression (17Probert L.

Bauer J. Akassoglou K. Lassmann H. Kollias G. Probert L. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 912-917Google Scholar). Only in areas of strongest TNF expression (i.e. hippocampus and cortex), ramified microglial cells positive for CD45 or mac3, considered as activation markers, could be detected (Fig. 1E, middle and lower panels). The data show that TNF transgene expression is in concordance with the expected pattern of the NR2B gene (22Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Google Scholar, 23Sasner M. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21316-21322Google Scholar). Moreover, immunohistochemical detection of TNF protein and microglial activation in tissue sections of transgenic but not of non-transgenic littermates indicates functional in vivo expression of the transgene. In addition, bioactive TNF could be detected on the cell membrane (Fig. 1, D and E) and in the supernatant of cultivated NR2B/TNF transgenic neurons (6 × 106 cells release 1 ng of soluble TNF in 24 h) but not in that of neurons from control littermates as determined by a standard bioassay (data not shown) (24Eskandari M.K. Nguyen D.T. Kunkel S.L. Remick D.G. Immunol. Investig. 1990; 19: 69-79Google Scholar, 25Green S. Dobrjansky A. Chiasson M.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1982; 68: 997-1003Google Scholar). Glutamate treatment had no effect on the NR2B promoter activity as determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of NR2B mRNA levels in wild type neurons (data not shown). TNF/TNFR2-mediated Signaling Protects Primary Cortical Neurons from Glutamate-induced Cell Death—Exposure of wild type murine primary cortical neurons to neurotoxic doses of glutamate lead to a time- and dose-dependent induction of cell death (Fig. 2, A and B), which was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, nuclear fragmentation, annexin V staining (Fig. 2C), and inhibition of neuronal cell death by MK801 (Fig. 3A), an inhibitor of the NMDA receptor, is indicative of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxic induction of apoptosis, which is in accordance with previous studies (26Lee J.M. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. Nature. 1999; 399: A7-A14Google Scholar). Primary cortical neurons from NR2B/TNF transgenic animals, in contrast to wild type and TNFR1- (TNFR1-/-) and TNFR2-deficient (TNFR2-/-) cells, were found to be almost completely resistant to glutamate-triggered excitotoxicity (Fig. 3A). To mimic the conditions of continuous TNF expression of TNF transgenic animals, wild type and TNFR-/- neuronal cells were pretreated for 24 h with TNF. Under these conditions, resistance toward glutamate-induced apoptosis could be induced in wild type and, to an even greater extent, in TNFR1-/- neuronal cells (Fig. 3B). By contrast, TNFR2-/- neurons were not only more susceptible to glutamate-induced cell death but also died upon TNF exposure (Fig. 3B). TNF stimulation of neuronal cultures simultaneously or subsequent to glutamate addition was found to be non-protective (data not shown). These data indicate that the resistance of primary cortical neurons toward an excitotoxic stimulus requires a preceding TNF signal via TNFR2. Studying ischemia reperfusion-induced damage of the retina of TNFR1-/- mice, we have recently shown that the locally applied PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, aggravated neuronal degeneration (10Fontaine V. Mohand-Said S. Hanoteau N. Fuchs C. Pfizenmaier K. Eisel U. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1-7Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated the role of PI3K in the glutamate-induced in vitro excitotoxicity model. The glutamate resistance of NR2B/TNF transgenic cortical neurons (Fig. 3C) and TNF-pretreated neurons of wild type or TNFR1-/- mice (Fig. 3B) was completely abolished by LY294002. Of note, although we found that protection of wild type and TNFR1-/- neurons required in vitro preincubation with TNF, the addition of the PI3K inhibitor as little as 30 min before the excitotoxic stimulus fully prevented the TNF-dependent survival of neurons (Fig. 3B). This finding indicates that in order to accumulate a protective TNF response, the TNFR2-mediated activation of a PI3K pathway has to occur within a narrow time span before the excitotoxic insult. Further evidence for distinct proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways emanating from TNFR1 and TNFR2, respectively, was obtained by the use of TNFR subtype-specific agonistic antibodies (27Tacchini-Cottier F. Vesin C. Redard M. Buurman W. Piguet P.F. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 6182-6186Google Scholar), allowing selective stimulation of either receptor in wild type neurons. TNFR specificity of the antibodies was verified by analyzing reactivity on TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- neurons (data not shown). The TNFR1-specific agonist alone elicited neuronal cell death in wild type neurons in a dose-dependent manner and did not protect from glutamate-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Conversely, selective stimulation of TNFR2 had no cytotoxic effect but instead led to an inhibition of neurotransmitter-triggered excitotoxicity (Fig. 4B). Again, the blocking of PI3K by LY294002 reverted the TNFR2-mediated protection (Fig. 4B), whereas the TNFR1-mediated cell death was not affected by the PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 4A). The critical involvement of PI3K signaling was confirmed by usage of wortmannin after selective TNFR2 stimulation (Fig. 4C) or TNF preincubation (data not shown). NMDAR Signaling Enhances TNFR2-induced PKB/Akt Activation—PKB/Akt is considered to be a prominent and ubiquitous downstream target protein of PI3K (28Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Google Scholar). Because of the TNF- and PI3K-dependent protection of cortical neurons from glutamate-induced apoptosis, we investigated PKB/Akt activity during excitotoxic stimulation of untreated and TNF-pretreated wild type, TNFR1-/-, and TNFR2-/- mice as well as that of NR2B/TNF transgenic mice. Western blot analyses were performed with protein lysates from cortical neurons treated with TNF and/or glutamate in the presence or absence of a specific NMDAR blocker (MK801) or a selective PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). Intense and persistent PKB/Akt phosphorylation was detected in both TNFR1-/- and wild type neurons after TNF and glutamate co-stimulation (Fig. 5A, lanes 4, 8, and 12). This was partially inhibited by LY294002 in wild type cells and completely abolished in TNFR1-/- cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 6, 10, and 14). In TNFR2-/- neurons, only a weak transient PKB/Akt activation was detected upon glutamate and TNF treatment (Fig. 5A, lanes 4, 8, and 12). These data show that the TNF-induced persistent PKB/Akt phosphorylation is TNFR2-mediated and PI3K-dependent. Moreover, we reveal to date an unrecognized strong enhancement of this signal pathway by the glutamate-activated NMDAR. In contrast to wild type, TNFR1-/-, and TNFR2-/- neurons, substantial levels of phospho-PKB/Akt were detected in NR2B/TNF transgenic neurons without in vitro TNF treatment (Fig. 5B, lane 1), which is in accordance with endogenous TNF expression in these neurons. As expected from the above experiments, PKB/Akt phosphorylation was PI3K-dependent at all of the time points analyzed (Fig. 5B, lanes 4, 7, 10, and 12). NMDAR Signaling Increases TNFR2-induced NF-κB Activation—NF-κB activation in primary cortical neurons was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy of nuclear translocated p65 (Fig. 6A) as well as by the EMSA (Fig. 6, E and F). The lone TNF treatment of TNFR1-/- or TNFR2-/- neurons revealed characteristic differences in NF-κB activation (Fig. 6B). Nuclear NF-κB translocation after stimulation of TNFR1 reached a maximum between 20 and 40 min (Fig. 6B, white bars), whereas TNFR2-mediated NF-κB translocation increased gradually, peaked after 4 h of stimulation, and was still discernable after 24 h (Fig. 6B, black bars).

https://openalex.org/W2162188338,"Resistin, founding member of the resistin-like molecule (RELM) hormone family, is secreted selectively from adipocytes and induces liver-specific antagonism of insulin action, thus providing a potential molecular link between obesity and diabetes. Crystal structures of resistin and RELMβ reveal an unusual multimeric structure. Each protomer comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich β-sandwich “head” domain and an amino-terminal α-helical “tail” segment. The α-helical segments associate to form three-stranded coiled coils, and surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of tail-to-tail hexamers. Analysis of serum samples shows that resistin circulates in two distinct assembly states, likely corresponding to hexamers and trimers. Infusion of a resistin mutant, lacking the intertrimer disulfide bonds, in pancreatic-insulin clamp studies reveals substantially more potent effects on hepatic insulin sensitivity than those observed with wild-type resistin. This result suggests that processing of the intertrimer disulfide bonds may reflect an obligatory step toward activation."

Our findings provide evidence for a predominant role of the intestinal peptide transporter for the delivery of bulk quantities of amino acids for growth and development, which consequently affects signaling pathways that regulate metabolism and aging. In all organisms the uptake of amino acids is mediated by a multitude of integral cell membrane carriers that transport amino acids either in free or in peptide-bound form. The two mammalian peptide transporters PEPT1 and PEPT2 are proton-dependent rheogenic carriers and have been grouped into the POT (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter) superfamily, which is also called peptide transporter family (1Steiner H.Y. Naider F. Becker J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). They transport short-chain peptides but also a variety of pharmacologically important compounds including selected β-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as antiviral and antineoplastic drugs (2Rubio-Aliaga I. Boll M. Daniel H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 734-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Bai J.P. Amidon G.L. Pharm. Res. 1992; 9: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, these transporters cannot transport larger peptides or free amino acids (4Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). PEPT1 is localized to apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells where it mediates the uptake of di- and tripeptides following the digestion of dietary proteins. In kidney, PEPT1 is also found in epithelial cells of the proximal tubule where it may contribute to the reabsorption of peptides after glomerular filtration (5Ganapathy M.E. Brandsch M. Prasad P.D. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25672-25677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The Caenorhabditis elegans genome contains two homologues of the human pept1 and pept2 genes, designated pep-2 and pep-1 (aka opt-2 and opt-1, encoding CPTB and CPTA, respectively) (6Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the deduced transporter proteins reveal only modest amino acid similarities with the mammalian proteins, the in vitro transport characteristics of the C. elegans and mammalian orthologues in Xenopus laevis oocytes are very similar (6Fei Y.J. Fujita T. Lapp D.F. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The C. elegans pep-2 gene encodes a protein with 36.9% amino acid sequence identity compared with the human PEPT1 and represents the low affinity/high capacity isoform of proton-coupled peptide transporters. Based on its role in intestinal absorption of peptide-bound amino acids, the PEP-2 protein may be important for overall protein nutrition of the organism. Whole body protein nutrition is linked to the available amino acid pool that regulates metabolic and reproductive adaptations through the partially interconnected insulin/IGF 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; TOR, target of rapamycin; AMCA, N(ϵ)-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid; S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference.1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; TOR, target of rapamycin; AMCA, N(ϵ)-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid; S6K, ribosomal protein S6 kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RNAi, RNA interference. and TOR/S6K signaling pathways. TOR senses the cellular amino acid pool and contributes to a signaling cascade that regulates transcription, translation, and protein degradation (7Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A partial loss of TOR function in Drosophila reduces growth, and flies deficient in the p70S6K gene (DS6K, a downstream target of TOR) are extremely delayed in development and are smaller in size (8Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). More recently, let-363, a C. elegans homologue of TOR, was identified and characterized (9Long X. Spycher C. Han Z.S. Rose A.M. Muller F. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1448-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). let-363 loss-of-function mutants exhibit a developmental arrest and death at the L3 larval stage (9Long X. Spycher C. Han Z.S. Rose A.M. Muller F. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1448-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that TOR function affects the life span and may interact with the DAF-2/insulin-signaling pathway in C. elegans (10Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Muller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). TOR has been implicated in the insulin/IGF network based on cell culture experiments (11Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D.

Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In both Drosophila and mammals, the levels of dietary protein or amino acid availability also affect the insulin-signaling pathway to control metabolism and growth (14Takenaka A. Oki N.

Here we describe the phenotypic alterations in C. elegans caused by the deletion of the intestinal peptide transporter pep-2. Our analysis clearly identifies intestinal peptide absorption as a key process in body protein homeostasis that affects both the TOR and the insulin-signaling pathways.

The mutant allele lg601 was back-crossed with N2 wild type animals seven times before analysis. pep-2(lg601) is recessive and represent a strong loss-of-function allele that could be rescued by a wild type transgene. In the pep-1 mutant allele lg501, a 2.5-kb deletion removes 1269 bp of the promoter sequence, the translational start codon, and the first six exons of the gene (bp 18289–20838 on cosmid C06G8). β-Ala-Lys-AMCA Staining—Mixed staged animals were washed off of agar plates with M9 buffer. Equal amounts of worms were incubated in a 1 mm β-Ala-Lys-AMCA solution (in M9) for 2–3 h followed by at least four additional washing steps with M9. As a control, worms were incubated in M9 buffer for the same time period. Pictures were taken with an AxioPlan 2 (Zeiss) using AxioVision 3.0 software. Body Length Measurements—Synchronized wild type and pep-2(lg601) animals were collected 0–5 days after L4 moult. Pictures of 20 individual worms were taken with Axioplan 2, and the precise body length was measured with AxioVision 3.0 software. Postembryonic Development—5–15 adult hermaphrodites were placed on fresh plates for egg laying. After 2–3 h they were removed, and at least 16 worms of the progeny were singled onto individual plates. The F1 animals were monitored every 2 h until they laid the first egg. Yolk Protein Distribution—Yolk protein distribution was analyzed by visual inspection of GFP expression in DH1033 bIs1[vit-2::gfp,-pFR4,sqt-1(sc103)] (24Grant B. Hirsh D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4311-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) BR2746 bIs1[vit-2::GFP,pFR4,sqt-1(sc103)]; pep-2(lg601). Life Span—Life span assays were performed as described (25Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), except that adult hermaphrodites were allowed to lay eggs for 8–10 h. Animals were grown at 20 °C. For assays at 25 °C, the animals were grown at 15 °C until the L4 moult and then shifted to 25 °C. We used the L4 moult as t = 0 for life span analysis. Stress Resistance and Other Assays—The assays for heat stress (35 °C) and oxidative stress (paraquat) resistance were performed as described previously (20Hertweck M. Gobel C. Baumeister R. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), except that on plates containing 150 mm paraquat animals were scored once a day. Self-brood size, embryonic development, defecation, and pharyngeal pumping assays were performed as described previously (26Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All analyses used animals fed with Escherichia coli OP50. For amino acid supplementation, 300 μl of amino acids (mixture 1:1 of minimum Eagle's medium (100×) nonessential amino acids and minimum Eagle's medium amino acids (50×) without l-glutamine (Invitrogen)) were added on top of the agar (35-mm plates) seeded with E. coli. Fresh plates were prepared each day during the experiment. RNAi through-feeding experiments were performed as described previously (27Kamath R.S. Martinez-Campos M. Zipperlen P. Fraser A.G. Ahringer J. Genome. Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0002)PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent sources of TOR(RNAi) vectors were used. The partial cDNA from yk18c10 was cloned into vector pPD129.36, resulting in a plasmid (gift of A. Gartner, Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Munich) that induced only a weak let-363 phenotype. A plasmid inducing a strong let-363/TOR phenotype had already been described previously (9Long X. Spycher C. Han Z.S. Rose A.M. Muller F. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1448-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Muller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). For developmental and intestinal phenotypes, animals at the L4 stage were placed on RNAi-inducing plates and allowed to lay progeny. Adults were removed or transferred to new RNAi-producing plates. First and third generation progeny grown on RNAi plates were scored for a TOR phenotype and yielded identical results. Life span experiments were performed according to Vellai et al. (10Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Muller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Hermaphrodites of wild type and mutants were grown on NGM agar plates seeded with E. coli OP50. Eggs were collected by sodium hypochlorite treatment and allowed to hatch by being incubated overnight at 20 °C in M9 buffer. Newly hatched L1 larvae were cultured on 150-mm agar plates. To prevent progeny production, 5-fluoro-2′deoxyuridine (dFUR, Sigma) was added to the agar at a final concentration of 40 μm after the animals had reached adulthood. Worms were washed off of the agar plates with M9 buffer. Living animals were collected because they floated on sucrose, washed several times with M9 buffer, resuspended with 5 mm EDTA, and frozen at –80 °C until use. Protein extracts were made by pounding and sonification. Their protein carbonyl content was measured as previously described (28Yasuda K. Adachi H. Fujiwara Y. Ishii N. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1999; 54: B47-B51Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Three to nine separate determinations were used to calculate the mean ± S.E. for each different age group. PEP-2 Functions as the Peptide Transporter in Intestinal Cells—We characterized a 1.7-kb deletion mutant, pep-2(lg601), which lacks 257 bp of the promoter, the translational start codon, and the first six exons of the pep-2 gene (Fig. 1A). Even if PEP-2 were expressed from this mutant allele, it would lack the N-terminal six transmembrane domains required for substrate binding and transport (29Doring F. Martini C. Walter J. Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 186: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and therefore pep-2(lg601) most likely represents a strong loss-of-function or null allele. To demonstrate that the pep-2(lg601) mutant strain has lost its capability for transport of di- and tripeptides, animals were exposed to the fluorescent dipeptide conjugate β-Ala-Lys-AMCA that was previously shown to be a representative substrate of PEPT1 (30Groneberg D.A. Doring F. Eynott P.R. Fischer A. Daniel H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G697-G704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient uptake of the reporter molecule into intestinal epithelial cells of wild type animals was indicated by a strong fluorescence of all intestinal cells, whereas the gut lumen lacked staining suggesting complete and rapid intestinal peptide absorption (Fig. 1B). When pep-2(lg601) animals were exposed to β-Ala-Lys-AMCA, the fluorescence was detectable only in the gut lumen, indicative of a normal ingestion but lack of absorption; we never observed fluorescence (other than the normal gut epifluorescence) inside of the epithelial cells (Fig. 1B). We conclude that PEP-2 is the only functional transporter in the intestine of C. elegans that is capable of transporting the dipeptide-conjugate β-Ala-Lys-AMCA representative for di-/tripeptides (30Groneberg D.A. Doring F. Eynott P.R. Fischer A. Daniel H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G697-G704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) across the apical membrane into the intestinal cells. Loss of PEP-2 Function Affects Growth and Development— Deletion of the pep-2 gene results in a decreased body size and a markedly reduced brood size (Fig. 2, A and D, and Table I), a similar phenotype to that reported for animals treated with opt-2 RNAi (31Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44657-44666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, the postembryonic development, in which the animals depend on external food supply, is delayed 1.8-fold in pep-2 mutants at 15 and 20 °C (Fig. 2B and Table I), whereas embryonic development that takes place in a protective eggshell is not significantly affected (Fig. 2C). In addition, the reproductive life span is extended from 5 days (wild type) to 9 days (Fig. 2E). Unlike in Egl (egg-laying-defective) animals, the eggs are laid at approximately the same developmental stage as in wild type animals (28–56 cell stage). This suggests that the production, rather than the retention, of eggs in the uterus appears to be the limiting factor in pep-2 animals. Fertilized eggs in the uterus of pep-2(lg601) displayed the same level of vitellogenin::gfp (vit-2::gfp) fluorescence as those of wild type animals (Fig. 2F), indicating a similar yolk concentration in mature eggs. These data indicate that receptor-mediated endocytosis of yolk is not affected in pep-2 mutant animals. However, because the production of individual eggs is severely retarded, the reduced availability of amino acid nitrogen most likely results in a delay of de novo protein synthesis. Deletion of pep-2, however, does not cause lethality, and the additional deletion of pep-1 (orthologue of hPepT2) did not enhance the pep-2 phenotype (Fig. 2G). Transgenic expression of pep-2 rescued both β-Ala-Lys-AMCA uptake (Fig. 1B) and the developmental defects (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the expression of the pep-2 genomic region in mutant animals is sufficient to restore the function of the transporter. This data provide further support for PEP-2 being the only uptake system for di-/tripeptides in the intestine.Table IDevelopmental phenotypes in pep-2 and daf-2 mutantsGenotypePostembryonic developmentaValues are means ± S.E. with number of animals shown in parentheses.N2No. of progenyaValues are means ± S.E. with number of animals shown in parentheses.N2hours%%Wild type67.1 ± 1.6 (48)100316.6 ± 4.1 (54)100daf-16(m26)74.1 ± 0.8 (37)110292.6 ± 7.3 (28)92pep-2(lg601)117.5 ± 2.6 (64)175109.3 ± 1.9 (79)35daf-16(m26);pep-2(lg601)114.0 ± 2.1 (16)17070.9 ± 4.6 (10)22daf-2(e1370)108.8 ± 4.9 (20)162210.0 ± 5.4 (30)66daf-16(m26);daf-2(e1370)78.7 ± 1.4 (37)117260.8 ± 4.2 (18)82daf-2(e1370);pep-2(lg601)148.7 ± 6.1 (21)22251.6 ± 1.1 (32)16daf-16(m26);daf-2(e1370); pep-2(lg601)125.1 ± 2.2 (24)186113.6 ± 2.6 (20)36a Values are means ± S.E. with number of animals shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Loss of PEP-2 Cannot Be Compensated by Amino Acid Supplementation of the Food Source—The developmental defects observed in pep-2 mutants could be caused by impaired food intake, a limited availability of amino acids as energy substrates resulting in caloric restriction, or a more specific effect by an insufficient supply of amino acids for maintaining protein homeostasis. We have measured pharyngeal pumping and defecation as two of the behavioral parameters recognized as valid indicators of sufficient food consumption (32Avery L. Thomas J.H. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.I. Priess J. Feeding and Defecation, C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Both parameters are indistinguishable in pep-2 and wild type animals (data not shown; Ref. 31Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44657-44666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, malabsorption of dipeptides and the associated lower intake of amino acids appear to be the sole determinants of the developmental defects. To assess whether amino acid deprivation in the pep-2 mutants can be overcome by the supplementation of free amino acids in the food, an amino acid mixture was added to the standard E. coli food source. In wild type animals, this amino acid supplementation did not affect brood size (Fig. 2D). In contrast, in pep-2(lg601) animals, it resulted in a partial but significant suppression of the brood size defect (Fig. 2D) and only a modest reduction of generation time (data not shown). These data suggest that amino acids from the supplement delivered via the amino acid transporters cannot compensate for the loss of PEP-2 mediated peptide transport under normal feeding conditions. Therefore, PEP-2 activity is critical for amino acid availability and homeostasis in the organism. pep-2(lg601) Interacts with the DAF-2 Insulin-signaling Pathway—C. elegans animals with reduced activity of the insulin/IGF receptor (DAF-2) also display developmental and reproductive defects (33Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M.L. Larsen P.L. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, both daf-2(e1370) and pep-2(lg601) mutants show a similarly delayed postembryonic development and reduced brood sizes (Table I). In daf-2;pep-2 double mutants, these phenotypic aspects are even more pronounced than in either of the single mutants (Table I). Only the phenotype caused by daf-2(e1370) was suppressed by daf-16(m26). In the daf-16;pep-2 double and daf-16;daf-2;pep-2 triple mutants, the phenotype of pep-2(lg601) was not affected by daf-16(m26). Thus, neither growth retardation nor reduced brood size of the pep-2 animals can be suppressed by daf-16 (Table I). These results suggest that pep-2 acts in parallel to daf-2 in a pathway that does not depend on DAF-16 function. The consequences of a restricted amino acid intake in adult worms have not been addressed previously, but it is known that a reduced caloric intake, or the perturbation of the underlying signaling pathways that sense energy availability, prolongs life span (34Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The reduced dietary availability of amino acids in pep-2 mutants may be interpreted as a reduced intake of calories, and therefore we tested whether the adult life span is altered in this mutant. As a control we used eat-2(ad453) (35Raizen D.M. Lee R.Y. Avery L. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1365-1382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a calorically restricted mutant that exhibits an extended life span as compared with the wild type (25Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). eat-2 was shown to also act in parallel to the insulin-like signaling pathway, a major contributor to the regulation of life span in C. elegans. Whereas we observed that both eat-2(ad453) and daf-2(e1370) animals showed a longevity phenotype at 20 or 25 °C as reported previously (25Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudner A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar), the life span of pep-2(lg601) animals was not altered at 20 °C and was even slightly shorter at 25 °C (Table II, Fig. 3A). Similar results have been reported recently after RNAi treatment of pep-2 (31Nehrke K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44657-44666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduced amino acid availability does not account for a caloric restriction that is severe enough to alter the adult life span substantially. In addition, unlike food deprivation, which can induce a dauer phenotype, pep-2(lg601) at 25 °C did not show an increase in dauer formation in the presence of food as compared with wild type.Table IIAdult life spanGenotypeMean life spanaValues are means ± S.E.Maximum life spanNbTotal number of animals.daysdays20 °CWild type13.6 ± 0.225500eat-2(ad453)18.3 ± 0.93650pep-2(lg601)14.2 ± 0.226250daf-2(e1370)21.8 ± 1.052150daf-16(m26)10.4 ± 0.220300daf-2(e1370);pep-2(lg601)31.9 ± 1.371150daf-16(m26);pep-2(lg601)9.3 ± 0.220300let-363(RNAi_weak)18.3 ± 0.630100let-363(RNAi_weak); pep-2(lg601)22.2 ± 0.43410025 °CWild type11.0 ± 0.321200pep-2(lg601)9.0 ± 0.318200daf-2(e1370)24.3 ± 0.746197daf-16(m26)8.9 ± 0.317100daf-16(m26);daf-2(e1370)10.9 ± 0.523100daf-16(m26);pep-2(lg601)7.4 ± 0.317100daf-2(e1370);pep-2(lg601)38.3 ± 0.977187daf-16(m26);daf-2(e1370);pep-2(lg601)9.8 ± 0.526100let-363(RNAi_strong)15.4 ± 0.422100let-363(RNAi_strong); pep-2(lg601)15.8 ± 0.323100a Values are means ± S.E.b Total number of animals. Open table in a new tab To assess whether there exists a cross-talk between the dietary intake of amino acids and daf-2-controlled longevity, we analyzed life span alterations in the daf-2(e1370);pep-2(lg601) double mutant strains, in which both pathways are perturbed. Surprisingly, the life span of daf-2(e1370) can be extended drastically in a pep-2 mutant background by around 60% when compared with the daf-2 single mutant (Fig. 3A, Table II). In addition, this longevity effect of pep-2(lg601) was completely suppressed in a daf-16;daf-2;pep-2 triple mutant (Fig. 3B, Table II). Thus, pep-2 deletion affects both daf-16-dependent and -independent outputs. Stress Resistance Is Enhanced in pep-2(lg601)—All long lived mutants in the daf-2 signaling pathway are hyperresistant to oxidative stress, heat, or UV stress (38Lithgow G.J. White T.M. Hinerfeld D.A. Johnson T.E. J. Gerontol. 1994; 49: B270-B276Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 39Lithgow G.J. White T.M. Melov S. Johnson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To assess whether there is an increased stress resistance in the pep-2(lg601) mutant background, we tested the animals for heat tolerance (35 °C) and resistance to oxidative stress (paraquat) (Fig. 3, C and D). Both assays showed an increased stress resistance of pep-2(lg601) mutant animals, which cannot be suppressed by daf-16(m26). In addition, the stress resistance of daf-2(e1370) mutant animals was significantly increased in the pep-2 mutant background. Most strikingly, under conditions (150 mm paraquat) that kill 100% of the pep-2(lg601) animals within 7 days and 90% of the daf-2(e1370) mutants within 10 days, no lethality was observed among daf-2;pep-2 mutants (Fig. 3D). Oxidative stress is known to damage proteins by the introduction of carbonyl groups, and the age-dependent accumulation of protein carbonyl appears to mirror the life span as shown in a variety of C. elegans mutants (28Yasuda K. Adachi H. Fujiwara Y. Ishii N. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1999; 54: B47-B51Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2081297467,"Abstract Macrophage activation is one of the hallmarks observed in trypanosomiasis, and the parasites must cope with the resulting oxidative burden, which includes the production of peroxynitrite, an unusual peroxo-acid that acts as a strong oxidant and trypanocidal molecule. Cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase (cTXNPx) has been recently identified as essential for oxidative defense in trypanosomatids. This peroxiredoxin decomposes peroxides using tryparedoxin (TXN) as electron donor, which in turn is reduced by dihydrotrypanothione. In this work, we studied the kinetics of the reaction of peroxynitrite with the different thiol-containing components of the cytosolic tryparedoxin peroxidase system in T. brucei (Tb) and T. cruzi (Tc), namely trypanothione, TXN, and cTXNPx. We found that whereas peroxynitrite reacted with dihydrotrypanothione and TbTXN at moderate rates (7200 and 3500 m– 1 s–1, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C) and within the range of typical thiols, the second order rate constants for the reaction of peroxynitrite with reduced TbcTXNPx and TccTXNPx were 9 × 105 and 7.2 × 105 m–1 s–1 at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, respectively. This reactivity was dependent on a highly reactive cTXNPx thiol group identified as cysteine 52. Competition experiments showed that TbcTXNPx inhibited other fast peroxynitrite-mediated processes, such as the oxidation of Mn3+-porphyrins. Moreover, steady-state kinetic studies indicate that peroxynitrite-dependent TbcTXNPx and TccTXNPx oxidation is readily reverted by TXN, supporting that these peroxiredoxins would be not only a preferential target for peroxynitrite reactivity but also be able to act catalytically in peroxynitrite decomposition in vivo."

KSHV, in the same γ-herpesvirus subfamily as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus saimiri, is capable of establishing both lytic and latent replication cycles (reviewed in Refs. 4Dourmishev L.A. Dourmishev A.L. Palmeri D. Schwartz R.A. Lukac D.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 175-212Google Scholar and 5Sarid R. Olsen S.J. Moore P.S. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 139-232Google Scholar). In KS, the virus localizes to tumor progenitor endothelial cells (6Boshoff C. Schulz T.F. Kennedy M.M. Graham A.K. Fisher C. Thomas A. McGee J.O. Weiss R.A. O'Leary J.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1274-1278Google Scholar), most of which are latently infected (7Staskus K.A. Zhong W. Gebhard K. Herndier B. Wang H. Renne R. Beneke J. Pudney J. Anderson D.J. Ganem D. Haase A.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 715-719Google Scholar). In cell culture, KSHV replication is generally studied using B-cell lines, such as BCBL-1, generated from primary effusion lymphoma material (8Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. McGrath M. Abbey N. Kedes D. Ganem D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 342-346Google Scholar). Most BCBL-1 cells are latently infected, although there is some spontaneous virus reactivation. Addition of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to these cells efficiently induces the lytic cycle and produces virions (8Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. McGrath M. Abbey N. Kedes D. Ganem D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 342-346Google Scholar). ORF50 (also known as RTA) and ORF57 (also known as MTA) proteins are the earliest KSHV regulatory genes to be expressed in the lytic cycle (9Paulose-Murphy M. Ha N.K. Xiang C. Chen Y. Gillim L. Yarchoan R. Meltzer P. Bittner M. Trent J. Zeichner S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4843-4853Google Scholar, 10Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Google Scholar) and essential for this phase of virus replication (11Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Google Scholar). A counterpart to ORF57 is present in every herpesvirus sequenced, indicating the importance of this signature viral protein. These protein homologues act post-transcriptionally affecting RNA splicing and transport, and they include EBV MTA (12Buisson M. Manet E. Trescol-Biemont M.C. Gruffat H. Durand B. Sergeant A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5276-5284Google Scholar, 13Lieberman P.M. O'Hare P. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 140-148Google Scholar), herpesvirus saimiri ORF57 (14Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 857-861Google Scholar), and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ICP27 (15Sandri-Goldin R.M. Mendoza G.E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 848-863Google Scholar). ICP27 protein, studied in some detail, acts at transcriptional (16Jean S. LeVan K.M. Song B. Levine M. Knipe D.M. Virology. 2001; 283: 273-284Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional levels, influencing pre-mRNA processing (17McLauchlan J. Phelan A. Loney C. Sandri-Goldin R.M. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6939-6945Google Scholar) and promoting nuclear export of viral RNAs (18Chen I.H. Sciabica K.S. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12877-12889Google Scholar, 19Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Google Scholar). ICP27 has been shown to bind RNA targets that are widely distributed throughout the HSV-1 genome (20Sokolowski M. Scott J.E. Heaney R.P. Patel A.H. Clements J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33540-33549Google Scholar). Like ICP27, KSHV ORF57 protein predominantly localizes to the nucleus (21Kirshner J.R. Lukac D.M. Chang J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3586-3597Google Scholar, 22Gupta A.K. Ruvolo V. Patterson C. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1038-1044Google Scholar, 23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar) and can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar). A post-transcriptional mode of ORF57 action was suggested as its expression increased the accumulation of cytoplasmic mRNA (21Kirshner J.R. Lukac D.M. Chang J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3586-3597Google Scholar, 22Gupta A.K. Ruvolo V. Patterson C. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1038-1044Google Scholar). The vast majority of HSV-1 genes are unspliced and ICP27 protein inhibits pre-mRNA splicing (24Sciabica K.S. Dai Q.J. Sandri-Goldin R.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1608-1619Google Scholar, 25Hardwicke M.A. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4797-4810Google Scholar, 26Bryant H.E. Wadd S.E. Lamond A.I. Silverstein S.J. Clements J.B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4376-4385Google Scholar). By contrast, although transcript mapping is not yet complete, the KSHV genome contains several spliced genes (reviewed in Refs. 4Dourmishev L.A. Dourmishev A.L. Palmeri D. Schwartz R.A. Lukac D.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 175-212Google Scholar and 27Zheng Z.M. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 173-184Google Scholar), including the ORF57 gene itself (23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar). Furthermore, because expression of ORF57 gave only a slight decrease in reporter gene activity from intron-containing reporter constructs (21Kirshner J.R. Lukac D.M. Chang J. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3586-3597Google Scholar, 22Gupta A.K. Ruvolo V. Patterson C. Swaminathan S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1038-1044Google Scholar), in virus-infected cells ORF57 may not profoundly inhibit pre-mRNA splicing. It appears that the ORF57 herpesvirus homologues may have shared and separate features; for example, EBV MTA protein only partially complemented ICP27 when inserted into an ICP27-null virus (28Boyer J.L. Swaminathan S. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9420-9433Google Scholar). Several nuclear replicating viruses, including herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), encode proteins that promote nuclear export of viral mRNAs and that also may inhibit export of cellular RNAs (reviewed in Ref. 29Cullen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 419-424Google Scholar). ICP27 protein stimulates the export of intronless HSV-1 mRNAs in Xenopus laevis oocytes via REF (also known as Aly) and TAP (also known as NXF1) proteins that are involved in cellular mRNA export (19Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Google Scholar). In HSV-1-infected cells, ICP27 protein interacts directly with REF and is present in a complex with TAP (18Chen I.H. Sciabica K.S. Sandri-Goldin R.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12877-12889Google Scholar, 19Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Google Scholar). HIV-1 Rev protein promotes the nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNAs (30Malim M.H. Hauber J. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Nature. 1989; 338: 254-257Google Scholar, 31Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Google Scholar, 32Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Google Scholar) via CRM1, a member of the karyopherin (or importin/exportin) family (33Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Google Scholar). A Rev region containing a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) directly interacts with CRM1 that, in turn, interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to promote RNA export with Ran GTPase as a cofactor (reviewed in Ref. 34Cullen B.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 587-597Google Scholar). CRM1 function is specifically inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB) that also inhibits Rev-mediated HIV-1 RNA export (33Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Google Scholar, 35Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Google Scholar). Export of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes containing cellular mRNAs is mediated by nuclear transport receptors that bind their cargoes and interact directly with components of the NPC (NPC reviewed in Ref. 36Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Google Scholar). REF belongs to a conserved superfamily of RNA-binding proteins that mediate the association between mRNPs and nuclear transport receptors (37Zhou Z. Luo M.J. Straesser K. Katahira J. Hurt E. Reed R. Nature. 2000; 407: 401-405Google Scholar, 38Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Google Scholar). Members of this superfamily are distinguished by conserved motifs at their N and C termini (Fig. 2A), between which a RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD) (39Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Google Scholar) and variable regions are located (39Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Google Scholar, 40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar). In the mouse, REF is encoded by at least three different genes (39Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Google Scholar, 40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar, 41Portman D.S. O'Connor J.P. Dreyfuss G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 527-537Google Scholar) that differ at multiple positions in the variable regions and there are multiple spliced variants (40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar). Murine REF1-II is generated by alternative splicing of REF1-I (42Bruhn L. Munnerlyn A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 640-653Google Scholar) and lacks the N-terminal variable region present in REF1-I and REF2-I (Fig. 2A), whereas murine REF2-I and REF2-II differ by a single amino acid insertion in REF2-I (40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar). REF1-II and REF2-I proteins exhibit 95% identity in their RBD (40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar) but differ at multiple positions within the C-vr region. REF recruits the export receptor TAP protein to cellular mRNPs (38Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Google Scholar, 40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar) forming part of the exon junction complex recruited to mRNAs during splicing (37Zhou Z. Luo M.J. Straesser K. Katahira J. Hurt E. Reed R. Nature. 2000; 407: 401-405Google Scholar, 43Le Hir H. Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. Moore M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4987-4997Google Scholar). Independent of splicing, REF can also associate with intronless mRNAs, influenced by both mRNA sequence and length (44Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1030-1035Google Scholar). In metazoan cells, the mRNP nuclear transport receptor consists of a large subunit (TAP) and a small subunit (p15). TAP, which itself facilitates the nuclear export of cellular mRNA (45Herold A. Klymenko T. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2001; 7: 1768-1780Google Scholar, 46Tan W. Zolotukhin A.S. Bear J. Patenaude D.J. Felber B.K. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1762-1772Google Scholar), heterodimerizes with p15 that further stimulates mRNP export (47Guzik B.W. Levesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Google Scholar, 48Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Google Scholar). TAP proteins represent a class of nuclear transport receptors that, via an essential C-terminal domain, directly interact with nucleoporin components of the NPC (49Strasser K. Bassler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Google Scholar, 50Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 136-158Google Scholar, 51Wiegand H.L. Coburn G.A. Zeng Y. Kang Y. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 245-256Google Scholar). The interaction of TAP with cellular RNAs is likely mediated by adaptor proteins such as REF, through protein-protein interactions (38Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Google Scholar, 40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B. Wilm M. Bork P. Izaurralde E. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 638-650Google Scholar, 44Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1030-1035Google Scholar). However, recent studies of Drosophila melanogaster cells and Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that while REF and other exon junction complex components contribute to mRNA export (52Longman D. Johnstone I.L. Caceres J.F. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 881-891Google Scholar, 53Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 579-588Google Scholar), they appear to be dispensable, with additional adaptors bridging the interaction between TAP and cellular mRNAs (53Gatfield D. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 579-588Google Scholar). TAP is also required for the export of unspliced simian type D retroviral RNAs, and binds directly to the constitutive transport element RNA sequence (54Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Google Scholar, 55Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Google Scholar). TAP-mediated cellular mRNA export and constitutive transport element-mediated RNA export do not require any karyopherin or Ran GTPase and are not inhibited by LMB (54Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Google Scholar, 56Saavedra C. Felber B. Izaurralde E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 619-628Google Scholar). We show that in KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cells, ORF57 protein was present in a complex with both REF and TAP proteins. The N-terminal region of ORF57 interacts with REF, whereas the N- and C-terminal domains of REF interact with ORF57. The interaction of ORF57 and REF was direct, with TAP being recruited via REF. In somatic cells, ORF57 was shown directly to function as a nuclear mRNA export factor using an assay that allows quantification of ORF57-mediated stimulation of RNA nuclear export in cultured cells. We show that overexpression of ORF57 bypasses nuclear retention and stimulates the nuclear export of unspliced reporter mRNAs that are otherwise exported inefficiently. The ORF57-mediated RNA export was CRM1-independent. These data extend what is known of this herpesvirus family of mRNA export factors, and we suggest that ORF57 protein utilizes more than one nuclear export route, perhaps in different cell types and at different stages of lytic viral infection. Plasmids—Plasmid pGST-ORF57 expressing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of ORF57 amino acids (aa) 1-455 full-length (FL) protein driven by a tac promoter was constructed by cloning ORF57 cDNA into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences). ORF57 sequences were excised from pKS4 (kind gift of Dr. L. Bello) containing ORF57 FL cDNA cloned into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Plasmids pGBKT7-ORF57 FL and pGBKT7-ORF57 small (containing the ORF57 gene 2nd exon, aa 181-455) were used for in vitro transcription/translation of the ORF57 protein. ORF57 FL and 2nd exon DNA sequences were excised as XhoI and PstI fragments from pKS4 and pKS1 (23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar), respectively, and cloned into SalI and PstI sites of pGBKT7 (Clontech), resulting in loss of both XhoI and SalI sites from pGBKT7-ORF57 FL and small. Plasmids pcDNA4-gORF57 (FL) and pcDNA4-cORF57 (FL) contain full-length genomic and cDNA sequences, respectively, driven by a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) promoter encoding the ORF57 (aa 1-455) protein. ORF57 genomic and cDNA sequences were PCR amplified with primers containing BamHI and XhoI sites using pKS3 (23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar) and pKS4 as templates, respectively, and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax B (Invitrogen). Deletion mutants of ORF57 FL were generated by PCR from pKS4 using primers with BamHI and XhoI sites and cloned into pcDNA4/HisMax C. They encoded ORF57 aa 17-455, 1-215, 181-328, 329-455, and 387-455; identities were confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. Plasmids GFP-gORF57 FL (pKS3) and GFP-ORF57 small (PKS1) were as described (23Bello L.J. Davison A.J. Glenn M.A. Whitehouse A. Rethmeier N. Schulz T.F. Clements J.B. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3207-3215Google Scholar). Plasmid pCMV-HA-RevM10-ORF57 was generated by cloning ORF57 cDNA into XhoI-SalI sites of pCMV-RevM10 (48Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Google Scholar) to express ORF57 as a C-terminal fusion with the HIV-1 RevM10 mutant. Plasmids pGST-REF2-I and its deletion mutants expressing GST fusions of REF2-I, as described previously (19Koffa M.D. Clements J.B. Izaurralde E. Wadd S. Wilson S.A. Mattaj I.W. Kuersten S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5769-5778Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. S. A. Wilson. Plasmid pCMV128 containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding region within an intron sequence was as described (57McDonald D. Hope T.J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7232-7238Google Scholar, 58Huang X.J. Hope T.J. Bond B.L. McDonald D. Grahl K. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2131-2134Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids pGEXCS-REF1-II, pRSETB-REF1-II (and their mutants) expressing GST, and histidine (His) fusions, respectively, of REF1-II (40Stutz F. Bachi A. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Seraphin B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Izaurralde. Plasmids pCMV-HARev and pCMV-HA-RevM10 (48Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Google Scholar) contain an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag for detection of Rev, RevM10, and RevM10-ORF57 fusion proteins. Plasmids pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) encoding β-galactosidase, pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) were used in transfections. Cell Culture and Antibodies—BCBL-1 cells from a KSHV-positive, EBV-negative primary effusion lymphoma (8Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. McGrath M. Abbey N. Kedes D. Ganem D. Nat.

Virol. 2003; 84: 1471-1483Google Scholar), and the KSHV-negative and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma cell line BJAB was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Human embryonic kidney 293 epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.01% streptomycin. A rabbit antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to KSHV ORF57 aa 182-195 (DGESPRFDDSIIPR), kindly provided by Dr. G.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to murine REF (KJ70, raised against the RBD of recombinant REF1-II) (44Rodrigues J.P. Rode M. Gatfield D. Blencowe B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We identified a large and essentially late H2O2 response of induced and repressed genes that unexpectedly comprise few or no antioxidants but mostly apoptosis and cell cycle control activities. The requirement of the p53 regulator for regulating about a third of this H2O2 stimulon and the lack of an associated enhancement of total cellular H2O2 scavenging activity further suggest that H2O2 elicits a stress antiproliferative/repair response that does not increase antioxidant defenses. We conclude that mammalian antioxidant defenses are constitutive, a finding that contrasts with the oxidant-inducibility of such defenses in microorganisms. This finding might be important in understanding the role of H2O2 as a key signaling molecule in mammals.

This finding might be important in understanding the role of H2O2 as a key signaling molecule in mammals. Oxygen is both essential for aerobic life, because it is the terminal electron acceptor in respiration, and dangerous, because of the potency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; RTQ, real time quantitative; TRR1, thioredoxin reductase 1. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; RTQ, real time quantitative; TRR1, thioredoxin reductase 1. to indiscriminately oxidize biological molecules. ROS include the superoxide anion ( O2.¯) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Antioxidant systems that avert ROS toxicity comprise the scavenging enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, selenothiol- and thiolperoxidase, as well as associated electron donor systems that include the pentose phosphate, thioredoxin, and glutathione pathways (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar, 2Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar, 3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M., C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1999: 105-245Google Scholar). In microorganisms, antioxidant systems are part of so-called oxidative stress-inducible adaptive responses (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Google Scholar, 2Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar, 4Demple B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 315-337Google Scholar). Specialized regulators operate these responses by sensing minimal increases in ROS concentration and setting the transcriptional expression of oxidant scavenger genes in proportion. Such regulation, meant to prevent oxidative stress-induced cellular damage, is essential for the aerobic life of microorganisms and has the hallmarks of a homeostatic control. It is not clearly established, however, whether similar ROS-inducible genetic responses exist in mammals. This question is highly significant because, in addition to their toxic side, ROS have been attributed specific roles in mammalian signal transduction. H2O2, especially, acts as a key signaling molecule in cell growth and differentiation (5Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Google Scholar, 6Sauer H. Wartenberg M. Hescheler J. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 11: 173-186Google Scholar), and many eukaryotic signaling pathways, by being redox-sensitive, could be influenced by ROS (7De Nigris F. Lerman L.O. Condorelli M. Lerman A. Napoli C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 1119-1130Google Scholar, 8Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Google Scholar, 9Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Google Scholar). The identification of mammalian ROS sensors should be an indication of the existence of ROS-inducible responses. However, as of today, no such function has been precisely identified in mammals. The Keap1-Nrf2 system senses electrophiles and controls the expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes through the antioxidant/electrophile response element (10Itoh K. Ishii T. Wakabayashi N. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 319-324Google Scholar, 11Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Google Scholar, 12Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Google Scholar), but it has no demonstrated direct role in ROS sensing per se (13Lee J.M. Calkins M.J. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12029-12038Google Scholar, 14Nakamura Y. Kumagai T. Yoshida C. Naito Y. Miyamoto M. Ohigashi H. Osawa T. Uchida K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4300-4309Google Scholar). Similarly, several stress-responsive regulators, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase stress-activated mitogen activated protein kinase and p53 can be activated by H2O2. However, these pathways are not known for regulating ROS intracellular concentration but rather for helping the cell cope with oxidative stress-induced damage through an appropriate control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA and protein repair systems. Genome-wide protein and mRNA profiling techniques provide another efficient strategy for investigating this question with the additional potential of increasing our understanding of how ROS homeostasis is achieved. In the present study we have analyzed the genomic response to H2O2 in human cell culture models by a DNA microarray analysis by using chips covering about half the human genome. We confirm the existence of a wide H2O2 genomic response in human cells, a large proportion of which is non-cell-type specific. Unexpectedly, the constitution of this response, comprising only a few activities participating in H2O2 metabolism and being dependent for about a third of it on the p53 regulator, resembles more a stress antiproliferative/repair response than the oxidative stress response usually seen in microorganisms. These data raise the question of the mechanism(s) that control H2O2 homeostasis in mammals. Cell Culture—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated. The MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line, gifts from Dr. J. Alam (New Orleans, LA) (subclone a), and the MRC-9 normal lung fibroblast (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and minimum essential medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Minimum essential medium was supplemented with non-essential amino acids (1×). The Boleth lymphoblastoid cell line, a gift from Dr. S. Chevillard (Fontenay Aux Roses, France), was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm Hepes, and 2.5 mm pyruvic acid. The MCF-7 subclone b and its derivative in which p53 was stably knocked down by RNA interference (p53kd MCF-7), a gift from Dr. R. Agami (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (15Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml G418. Treatments—Exponentially growing cells (106) were plated into 75 cm2 flasks; medium was changed the next day, and cells were further incubated for 2 days. The MCF-7b cell line and its p53kd derivative were grown without G418. For treatment, cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) and treated with H2O2 (Sigma) or vehicle (Hanks' balanced salt solution) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were reincubated for the indicated times before RNA or protein extraction in their 2-day-old conditioned medium, which was stored at 37 °C during treatment. This protocol was adapted from Keyse and Tyrrell (16Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Google Scholar). Bovine liver catalase (2000 units/ml; Sigma), dithiothreitol (20 μm; Sigma), β-mercaptoethanol (20 μm; Sigma), or N-acetyl-l-cysteine (10 mm; Sigma) were added to cultures 1 day before RNA extraction as indicated. Normoxic experiments were performed in an atmosphere containing 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2. Doxorubicin (0.35 μm; Sigma) was applied directly in medium for 4 h. mRNA Extraction and Microarray Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA by using the Superscript choice kit (Invitrogen) with a T7-(dT)24 primer incorporating a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. cRNAs were generated and biotin-labeled by T7-dependent in vitro transcription (Enzo Biochemical, New York, NY). Labeled cRNAs were fragmented by incubation at 94 °C for 35 min in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium acetate. Fifteen micrograms of fragmented cRNAs were hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to HG U133a arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The gene chips were washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin in a fluidics station, and scanned at 3-μm resolution in the Affymetrix Genechip System confocal scanner (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France). Microarray Data Analyses—The genomic response to H2O2 was analyzed 5 h after exposure to H2O2 in a duplicate experiment, which differed in that the Boleth cell line was only analyzed once. Each experimental point was established on the comparison of the chip data of the H2O2-treated cell sample with its corresponding vehicle-treated control, which was otherwise grown under the same conditions. Data analyses were performed by single array analysis, which generated probe set detection calls (absent/marginal/present) and associated p values, and by Chip Comparison Analysis, which generated probe set change calls (increased/marginally increased/no change/marginally decreased/decreased), associated change p values, and signal log ratios; both algorithms were provided in the Affymetrix MicroArray Suite software MAS 5.0 (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/whitepapers/sadd_whitepaper.pdf). Data were filtered as follows. Probe sets not detected under both vehicle-treated and H2O2-treated conditions (detection call absent), those not having a statistical change between the two conditions (no change call) in either one or both duplicate experiments, and those with opposite change calls (increased and decreased) in the duplicates were eliminated. As a further filter, we eliminated probe sets that appeared regulated (increased or decreased change calls) in the chip comparison analysis of the two vehicle-treated duplicate samples. The remaining probe sets were considered as being regulated by H2O2, and their signal log ratios, converted to fold changes (fold change = 2 signal log ratio), were used as a quantitative estimate of the changes in gene expression. Validation of the Microarray Data Analysis—To evaluate experimental variations not linked to the H2O2 treatment and reproducibility of the experimental system, we compared signal log ratio distributions of duplicate vehicle-treated samples with their matched experimental samples. Relative frequencies of signal log ratios of each comparison were first calculated from the absolute histogram on the range of –5 to +5 divided into 100 classes. These frequencies were then plotted using the Grace 5.1.12 software (plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace). Data for all genes that were identified as regulated by H2O2 at 5 h in MCF-7a, MRC-9, and p53kd MCF-7 are shown in Fig. S1 (supplemental data, available in the on-line version of this article). Real Time Quantitative (RTQ) PCR—Unique oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed with the Oligo 6.3 program (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO) using sequence data from the NCBI data base and assayed on efficiency (> 80%) and specificity (only one product detected on the fusion curve). One microgram of RNeasy Mini kit-purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen) with random hexanucleotides (Roche Diagnostics). Real time quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate on the Bio-Rad iCycler iQ real time detection system (Bio-Rad) of using the fluorescent SYBR Green method in a 25-μl mixture containing 5 μl of cDNA, 0.4 μm each primer, and 12.5 μl of 2× Platinium® Quantitative PCR Super-Mix-UDG (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. β-actin expression was used as internal control. p53 Western Blot—Cells were lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Lysates were clarified by a 10-min centrifugation at 15,000 rpm. Twenty micrograms (DC protein assay reagent; Bio-Rad) protein extracts were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). The membrane was incubated with the DO-1 anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (1:1000) and then with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) (1:8000). Detection was carried out using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of H2O2 Concentration—Exponentially growing cells (3 × 105) were plated into 25-cm2 flasks, incubated for 48 h, and then treated for 30 min with 100 μm H2O2 or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were re-incubated for 4.5 h in conditioned medium, treated with 400 μm H2O2 for different times, and then loaded for 30 min with 10 μm 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester) (C-DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). They were then harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 515–540 nm). The Genomic Response to H2O2 of Mammalian Cells in Culture—The human genomic response to H2O2 was analyzed by comparative whole genome mRNA profiling between vehicle-treated and H2O2-treated cells from two independent subclones of the breast cancer-derived tumor cell line MCF-7 (a and b) and from the fibroblast primary culture MRC-9. Preliminary experiments indicated that, within a 50–800 μm concentration range, H2O2 had an optimal effect on gene expression at 100 μm, a dose that otherwise slowed down the cell doubling time with no apparent effect on cell viability (not shown). Kinetics measurements also showed that the genomic response was essentially recorded 5 h after treatment with only a negligible response after 30 min (not shown). Accordingly, mRNA profiles were recorded 5 h after a 100 μm H2O2 treatment. Two independent experiments for each point were performed for each cell culture model to evaluate interexperimental variations. Data processing by the Affymetrix MAS 5.0 algorithm (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that, in MCF-7a, 828 genes had mRNA levels significantly changed (429 increased, 399 decreased). Similarly, in MCF-7b, 835 genes appeared regulated (580 increased, 255 decreased). Two hundred ninety-six genes appeared to be commonly regulated in both MCF-7 subclones and were taken as highly representative of the H2O2 genomic response of MCF-7. In MRC-9, 1097 genes appeared regulated by H2O2 (292 increased, 805 decreased). The names and details of all H2O2-regulated genes are given in the supplemental data in the on-line version of this article. Crossing the MCF-7 and MRC-9 H2O2-regulated gene list identified 127 commonly regulated genes. This list was further filtered by applying the arbitrary fold change threshold of ≥ 1.74 for increased and ≤ 0.57 for decreased genes, thereby identifying 42 genes that represent the most highly regulated genes and can be taken as reflecting the non-cell type-specific human response to H2O2. These 42 genes were sorted into functional classes (Table I). We confirmed these results by monitoring via RTQ PCR the change of expression of a random sample of these genes (five up-regulated genes and six down-regulated) (see Table I).Table IThe 42 most highly H2O2-regulated genes common to MCF-7 and MRC-9.

A majority of these genes actually encode activities that are typical of the response to genotoxic stress, such as those controlling the cell cycle, mitosis, apoptosis, cell growth, and differentiation. Importantly, these functional classes reflect those found in the bulk unfiltered gene lists established from individual cell culture model analyses (see supplemental data in the on-line version of this article). Note also that 17 of the genes of Table I have been identified previously as targets of the p53 transcriptional regulator, further reinforcing the impression of a genotoxic stress response. These genes include the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, p21), the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (GADD45-α), the magnesium-dependent protein phosphatase 1D (PPM1D, Wip-1), the Bcl-2 binding component 3 (BBC3/PUMA), and the human homologue of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). The Mammalian H2O2 Genomic Response Does Not Include Antioxidants—Surprisingly, analysis of individual, unfiltered lists of regulated genes from MCF-7 and MRC-9 showed that except for thioredoxin reductase (TRR1), the two subunits of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC and GCLM), and HO-1, no other genes known for their involvement in ROS metabolism were present (see supplemental data in the on-line version of this article). Microarray analysis of a third model, the Boleth lymphoblastoid cell line, showed H2O2-regulated genes very similar in function to those of MCF-7 and MRC-9, with 24 of these genes common to the three cellular models among the most highly regulated genes (Table I and supplemental data). Again in this model, with the exception of HO-1, no other antioxidants were regulated by H2O2. Thus, we systematically verified by RTQ PCR the regulation by H2O2 of typical antioxidants in MCF-7 (Fig. 1, and data not shown). In keeping with the microarray analysis, only TRR1 and HO-1 responded to H2O2, and peroxiredoxin 1, peroxiredoxin 6, thioredoxin 1, and the γ-glutamylcysteine ligase catalytic subunit did not. We also explored four other human cell lines, namely HeLa (uterine cervix carcinoma-derived), HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-derived), Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma-derived), and U937 (histiocytic lymphoma-derived), and also the endothelial primary culture HAAE-1. None of the above-mentioned genes responded to H2O2, with the exception of HO-1 (not shown). Antioxidants could have been pre-induced by the H2O2 present in culture medium (17Halliwell B. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 3-6Google Scholar), thus offsetting the response to exogenous H2O2, but neither the addition to the culture medium of the following reducing or H2O2-scavenging agents, i.e. catalase, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol, nor the lowering of the oxygen concentration to 5% changed the expression pattern of these typical antioxidants in both MCF-7 and MRC-9 (data not shown). p53 Is a Major Transcriptional Regulator of the H2O2 Response—The high number of H2O2-regulated genes known previously to be targets of p53 suggested the involvement of this regulator in the H2O2 response. Consistent with this idea, p53 accumulated in response to H2O2 at the concentration used in the microarray analyses in MCF-7 (Fig. 2A) and MRC-9 and also in the Boleth lymphoblastoid cell line (not shown). We thus determined whether p53 contributed to the H2O2 response by analyzing the H2O2 genomic response in p53kd MCF-7, a derivative of MCF-7b in which p53 expression is inhibited by the stable expression of a p53 short interfering RNA (siRNA) (15Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Microarray data analysis showed that 519 genes had a significant gene expression change after H2O2 treatment (414 increased, 105 decreased) (see supplemental data in the on-line version of this article). Crossing this gene list with the 296 highly representative MCF-7 regulated genes showed that 130 genes were commonly regulated, with the remaining 389 p53kd MCF-7 regulated genes being either uniquely induced in this cell line or common only to one of the two MCF-7 wild type subclones. To identify candidate genes regulated by p53, we analyzed the expression status of the 296 MCF-7 highly representative regulated genes in the p53kd MCF-7 microarray data (Fig. 2C). Based on a correlated change call in both replicates, 121 genes were regulated (40.9%), and 85 (28.7%) had lost their regulation. The remaining 90 genes (30.4%) had duplicates change calls that did not correlate and could not be evaluated. We further extended this analysis by fold change estimation of the 121 still regulated genes in p53kd MCF-7 by using signal log ratios as parameter, revealing that 15 genes had their expressions minored by ≥ 2-fold as compared with their fold changes in MCF-7 (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results suggest an important contribution of p53 in the MCF-7 H2O2 response. They also show that a large fraction of the p53kd MCF-7 H2O2 response is unique to this cell line, suggesting further differences between these cell lines in addition to the defects of p53-driven transcription, which could relate to a compensating response to this defect. We verified by RTQ PCR the p53 dependence in the change of expression of the three H2O2-regulated genes known as p53 targets that were scored in p53kd MCF-7 with a complete for PA26 or a partial for p21 (p21 fold change MCF-7 versus p53kd MCF-7 = 8.88 versus 2.38) loss of regulation or with a duplicate change call that did not correlate (PPM1D) (see Table I). Here again, loss of regulation was complete for PA26 and partial for p21 (Fig. 2D). This assay also showed a complete loss of regulation for PPM1D, thus validating the no change call seen in one of the duplicate. The Cellular Antioxidant Capacity Does Not Increase in Response to Exogenous H2O2—Despite the lack of a coordinated induction of antioxidants in response to H2O2, we verified whether mammalian cells could still enhance their antioxidant capacity under the same conditions that triggered the H2O2 genomic response by using dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence as an indirect measure of H2O2 concentration. When cells were exposed to a subtoxic H2O2 concentration (400 μm), dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence increased as compared with that of the vehicle-treated control and then decreased within 30 min after treatment back to the fluorescence levels of the control cells (Fig. 3). This 30-min period, which corresponds to the time needed for cells to correct the intracellular H2O2 concentration, was not altered when cells were pretreated either 1 (not shown) or 5 h earlier with H2O2 at the non-toxic concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3). These experiments thus indicate that mammalian cells have a constitutive but not an adaptive H2O2-inducible antioxidant capacity. The mechanism(s) regulating H2O2 intracellular concentration represents an important question in mammalian biology that should provide some clues as to how mammalian cells reconcile the paradox of the potential toxic effect of this oxidant and its purported important role in cell signaling. To approach this question, we monitored the changes of mRNA profiles in response to a non-toxic concentration of H2O2 in human cell cultures. We show that the genes that respond to H2O2 comprise mostly apoptosis and cell cycle control activities and no or very few antioxidants. Using a p53 knock-down cell line model, we also demonstrate a large contribution of the p53 anti-oncogene in regulating this response. Finally, indirect measures of H2O2 intracellular concentration using the fluorescent dye dichlorofl"

This motif is conserved throughout eukaryotes and is present in numerous proteins involved in a wide variety of cellular processes including endocytosis, protein trafficking, and signal transduction. We previously reported that the UIMs of epsin were both necessary and sufficient for its ubiquitylation. In this study, we found that many, but not all, UIM-containing proteins were ubiquitylated. When expressed as chimeric fusion proteins, most UIMs promoted ubiquitylation of the chimera. In contrast to previous studies, we found that UIMs do not exclusively promote monoubiquitylation but rather a mixture of mono-, multi-, and polyubiquitylation. However, UIM-dependent polyubiquitylation does not lead to degradation of the modified protein. UIMs also bind polyubiquitin chains of varying lengths and to different degrees, and this activity is required for UIM-dependent ubiquitylation. Mutational analysis of the UIM revealed specific amino acids that are important for both polyubiquitin binding and ubiquitin conjugation. Finally we provide evidence that UIM-dependent ubiquitylation inhibits the interaction of UIM-containing proteins with other ubiquitylated cellular proteins.

The presence of UIMs in numerous proteins ranging from the Machado-Joseph disease protein (MJD1/ataxin3) to USP25, a member of the deubiquitylating enzyme family, suggests that this region is involved in regulating protein function.

Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification resulting in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin through its COOH-terminal Gly to the ϵ-NH2 group of a Lys residue in a target protein. This process involves a multienzyme cascade that begins with the activation of ubiquitin in the presence of ATP and an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme. Subsequently the ubiquitin is transferred through a thiol-ester bond to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and through the action of an E3 ubiquitin ligase is attached to the substrate by an isopeptide bond. Polyubiquitylation, the attachment of multimeric chains of ubiquitin, leads to the proteolytic destruction of proteins when Lys48 of ubiquitin is the site of chain formation. However, ubiquitin chains formed through Lys63 are not involved in protein degradation but rather a variety of processes including DNA repair, translation, IκB kinase activation, endocytosis, and protein transport (for a review, see Ref. 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). In contrast to polyubiquitylation, some proteins are modified by the attachment of a single ubiquitin, termed monoubiquitylation (13Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). A variation on this process is the attachment of single ubiquitin molecules to multiple lysines within a protein, hereafter referred to as multiubiquitylation. Although the precise function of mono- and multiubiquitylation is still unclear, studies indicate that these modifications are important for endocytosis, transcriptional regulation, and trafficking of receptors to the lysosome (for a review, see Ref. 12Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Thus, the ubiquitylation pathway controls protein function and cell fate in a number of ways. Although the precise function of UIM-directed ubiquitylation is still unclear, a number of studies suggest that this modification is physiologically important. Genetic studies of photoreceptor development in Drosophila have identified an epsin ortholog, termed Liquid facets (Lqf), as an important mediator of photoreceptor cell fate (14Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also uncovered a role for a deubiquitylating enzyme, Fat facets (Faf), in regulating Lqf function. Loss-of-function mutations in Faf result in a phenotype similar to loss-of-function mutations in Lqf (14Cadavid A.L. Ginzel A. Fischer J.A. Development. 2000; 127: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and biochemically result in Lqf polyubiquitylation and degradation (15Chen X. Zhang B. Fischer J.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, in mammalian cells, epsin is not targeted for polyubiquitylation and degradation but rather is monoubiquitylated (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). A recent study from DeCamilli and colleagues (16Chen H. Polo S. Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14908-14913Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) provides compelling evidence for a rapid Ca+2-dependent deubiquitylation of epsin mediated by the mammalian counterpart of Faf. This deubiquitylation restores the ability of epsin to interact with phospholipid vesicles as well as components of the clathrin coat thereby providing the first direct evidence for a physiological role for UIM-dependent ubiquitylation. Although less direct, genetic studies in yeast have demonstrated that mutations in UIMs of proteins also lead to defects in protein trafficking (10Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Gillooly D.J. Madshus I.H. Stang E. Stenmark H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 11Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Although the phenotypes of these mutations were ascribed to loss of ubiquitin binding by the UIMs, these mutations would also block ubiquitylation of the UIM proteins. Thus, the contribution of these two activities of the UIMs, i.e. ubiquitylation and ubiquitin binding, cannot be discerned from these experiments. Given previous findings and the observation that UIMs are present in a wide variety of proteins, we initiated studies of the UIMs from numerous proteins to evaluate whether these motifs play a general role in ubiquitylation. In addition, we performed a structure-function analysis to gain insight into the mechanism of UIM-dependent ubiquitylation. The results presented here demonstrate that UIMs, in general, bind polyubiquitin chains and promote ubiquitylation. Additionally ubiquitylation of UIM proteins appears to inhibit their interaction with ubiquitylated targets. Finally our data suggest a new mechanism for UIM-directed ubiquitylation.

The following UIM constructs were constructed by PCR amplification of A431 cDNA: Hrs UIM (aa 252-288) with 5′HRS_UIM (GACGGATCCAAGAGGGACGAGACGGCCCTG) and 3′HRS_UIM (GACGATATCAGTGTACGTGGACTTCTGTCT), USP25 UIM (aa 88-117) with 5′USP_UIM (GACGGATCCGATACAAATGTGATTGATCTCA) and 3′USP25_UIM (GACGATATCAATGGCTTGTTCCTCATCAGTT), MJD1 UIM (aa 216-356) with 5′MJDcorrect (GACGGATCCAATGATGGCTCAGGAATGTT) and 3′MJD_UIM (GACGATATCTGTTTTCAAATCATTTCTGACA), RPN10 UIM (aa 203-329) with 5′HS5_UIM (GACGGATCCGACTTTGAATTTGGAGTAGAT) and 3′HS5_UIM (GACGATATCGGCATCAATGTCTGTGATT), KIAA1386 UIM (aa 974-1010) with 5′K1386_UIM (GACGGATCCTTGGATGAAGACGATCCCAATATA) and 3′K1386_UIM (GACGATATCTAAGGATGCTTCATTACTGAGGAA), HSJ UIM (aa 235-294) with 5′HSJ_UIM (GACGGATCCCAGGTCCAGCAGACCCCTGCCT) and 3′HSJ_UIM (GACGATATCCTGGATCTTGGTGCTGGGCCTT), KIAA1594 UIM (aa 646-799) with 5′K1594_UIM (GACAGATCTGAATTGGAAAACTCAGGATTT) and 3′-K1594_UIM (GACGATATCGGAGTTGTTAAACTCTTGAAGA), and MEKK1 UIM (aa 1162-1186) with 5′MEKK1_UIM (GACGGATCCATGGAGGCTGAGGAAGAGGAGGCGCT) and 3′MEKK1_UIM (GACGATATCTATGGGGAGGGCGTCCTGAGAAGCCGA). Each resulting product except KIAA1594 was digested with BamHI and EcoRV. The KIAA1594 product was digested with BglII and EcoRV. The fragments were then subcloned into pEFG (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P.

GST-epsin (UIM1-3) and GST-Eps15 (UIMwt) were described previously (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). pGEX epsin, pGEX eps15, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-epsin, and YFP-eps15 were made by digesting GST-epsin and GST-eps15 with BamHI and SmaI and subcloning into pEYFP digested with BglII and SmaI and pGEX digested with BamHI and EcoRV. Mutant versions of Hrs and USP25 UIMs were created using Qiagen multisite-directed mutagenesis kits with the following primers: HrsL265R with HRSmutL-R (GAGGAGGAGCTGCAGCGGGCCCTGGCGCTGTC), USP25R104L with USPmutR-L (GATGATCTTCAGCTAGCAATTGCCTTG), USP25L110Q/A111S with USPmutLA-QS (AATTGCCTTGAGTCAGGCCGAATCAAACA), and Hrs Q271L/S272A with HRSmutQS-LA (GCCCTGGCGCTGTCATTGGCAGAGGCGGAGGA). Hrs triple mutant and USP25 triple mutant were created using both corresponding primers. The pGEX versions of these constructs were created by PCR amplifying the UIMs from the YFP mutated versions using 5′HRS_UIM, 3′HRS_UIM, 5′USP_UIM, and 3′USP_UIM. Fragments were then digested with BamHI and EcoRV and subcloned into pGEX digested with BamHI and EcoRV. The UIMs of Hrs, MJD, and RPN10 were PCR-amplified from the YFP-UIM DNA using the 3′ UIM primers from above and the following 5′ primers: RPN10-YFP with 5S5a-YFP (GACAAGCTTACCACCATGGACTTTGAATTTGGAGTAGAT), Hrs-YFP with 5HRS-YFP (GACAAGCTTACCACCATGGACGAGACGGCCCTGCAGGA), and MJD-YFP with 5MJD-YFP (GACAAGCTTACCACCATGGCAAATGATGGCTCAGGAAT). Each primer included the addition of a start site at the beginning of the sequence. The resulting products were digested with BamHI and EcoRV and subsequently subcloned into the pEFYP-N1 vector (Clontech) digested with BglII and SmaI. The HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin expression construct pMT123 used in the GST fusion protein experiments has been described previously (19Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann. For determining the type of ubiquitylation and YFP fusion protein experiments, FLAG-tagged ubiquitin was created by digesting the pcDNA3 HA-ubiquitin construct kindly provided by Dr. Cam Patterson with BamHI and EcoRI. The fragment was then subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector digested with SmaI and XbaI (Sigma). The UbΔK construct was created by first mutating lysines 6, 11, 27, and 33 of the pCDNA3 HA-UbK29R/K48R/K63R mutant construct kindly provided by Dr. Cam Patterson using the Qiagen multisite-directed mutagenesis kit and the following 5′ phosphorylated primers: Lysine 6, CAGATCTTCGTGAGGACCCTTACCGGC; Lysine 11, ACCCCTTACCGGCAGGACCATCACCCTT; Lysine 27, CATCGAAAATGTGAGGGCCAGGATCCAGG, and Lysine 33, CAAGATCCAGGATAGAGAAGGCATCCCTC. The construct was then digested with NheI and EcoRV and subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector digested with SmaI and XbaI. FLAG-UbI44A was created by mutating isoleucine 44 to alanine of the pFLAG-CMV-2 Ub construct using the Qiagen multisite-directed mutagenesis kit and the following primer: UB I44A, CAGCAGAGGCTCGCGTTTGCAGGCAAG. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Ubiquitylation Assays—Assays were performed essentially as described previously (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged epsin, MJD1, HSJ1, Hrs, KIAA1386, or MEKK1 and 4 μg of FLAG-tagged UbWT, UbΔK, or UbI44A. Fusion proteins were purified from lysates (1 mg of protein) using HA affinity beads (Affiniti). Precipitates were washed five times with PLC-LB as described previously (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Membranes were probed with either anti-HA to detect expression of the full-length proteins or anti-FLAG to detect ubiquitylation. Western blot analysis of 30-40 μg of lysates verified equal expression of the UbWT, UbΔK, and UbI44A. Similarly HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of various YFP constructs along with 4 μg of FLAG-tagged UbWT, UbΔK, or UbI44A. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the full-length A.V. polyclonal antibody (Clontech), fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody to detect ubiquitylation. Expression of the YFP-UIM or UIM-YFP proteins was detected by immunoblotting with Living Colors peptide antibody (Clontech). The GST pull-down experiments were done as described previously (8Oldham C.E. Mohney R.P. Miller S.L. Hanes R.N. O'Bryan J.P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Treatment with harsher lysis conditions was done by adding 1/10 volume of 10% sodium deoxycholate and 1/100 volume of 10% SDS to the lysate prior to immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with PLC-LB supplemented with 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS and twice with PLC-LB containing no sodium deoxycholate or SDS. Ubiquitin Binding Assays—The wild type or mutant GST-UIM constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using GSH beads. The GST fusion proteins were diluted to 200 pmol/50 μl of a 50% slurry of the following lysis buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors (as described in Ref. 8Oldham C.E.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1112-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 50 μl of the GST proteins in 450 μl of lysis buffer were mixed with 1 μl of ubiquitin or polyubiquitin ranging from two to seven ubiquitins (Affiniti) at a concentration of 0.25 μg/μl. Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were pelleted and washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer without bovine serum albumin. Samples were fractionated on a gel and detected via Gel Code© blue stain. Alternatively gels were transferred to an Immobilon P filter and preincubated with denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described in Ref. 20Avantaggiati M.L.

After washing extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, the filter was immersed in 100% methanol for 5 min, placed on filter paper, dried for 15 min, and then probed with α-ubiquitin. Ubiquitylation of UIM-containing Proteins—To gain understanding into the function of UIMs in ubiquitylation and ubiquitin binding, we evaluated the biochemical properties of UIMs from a variety of proteins (Fig. 1). These proteins were chosen based on their involvement in endocytosis, signal transduction pathways, and various human diseases. RPN10 is a subunit of the 26 S proteasome that specifically binds polyubiquitin chains and was the founding member of the UIM family of proteins (2Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M.

Hrs is a tyrosine kinase receptor substrate that has been implicated in the endocytosis of growth factor-receptor complexes (21Raiborg C. Stenmark H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), while USP25 is thought to be a deubiquitylating enzyme linked to Down syndrome (22Valero R. Marfany G. Gonzalez-Angulo O. Gonzalez-Gonzalez G. Puelles L. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Genomics. 1999; 62: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). KIAA1386 and KIAA1594 are uncharacterized proteins (23Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Similar to USP25, KIAA1594 contains two bipartite ubiquitin protease catalytic domains suggesting it may function as a deubiquitylating enzyme. KIAA1386 contains three parkin-type complex zinc finger domains and one parkin COOH-terminal domain suggesting a link to Parkinson's disease. HSJ1 is a neuron-specific protein involved in clathrin uncoating (24Cheetham M.E. Anderton B.H. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), while MJD1 is a polyglutamine tract protein that undergoes expansion of its polyglutamine region leading to the neuro-degenerative disorder Machado-Joseph disease (25Kawaguchi Y. Okamoto T. Taniwaki M. Aizawa M. Inoue M. Katayama S. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. Nishimura M. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). MEKK1 is a Ser/Thr kinase involved in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and also contains a plant homeodomain domain that functions as a non-canonical RING finger E3 ligase (26Lu Z.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that epsin, Eps15/Eps15R, and Hrs are monoubiquitylated in a UIM-dependent manner (6Katz M. Shtiegman K. Tal-Or P. Yakir L. Mosesson Y. Harari D. Machluf Y. Asao H.

Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We tested the possibility that UIM-containing proteins in general might undergo a similar post-translational modification. HA epitope-tagged MJD1, Hrs, HSJ1, epsin, KIAA1386, or MEKK1 were transiently co-expressed in 293T HEK cells along with FLAG epitope-tagged ubiquitin (UbWT). Western blot analysis of HA immunoprecipitates revealed that all the full-length proteins were expressed at similar but not identical levels (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). In addition, there were slower migrating HA-reactive bands in the Hrs and MJD1 samples that were shifted by 13-kDa increments consistent with the attachment of FLAG ubiquitin. Indeed these shifted forms reacted with antibodies to tagged ubiquitin (Fig. 2A, top panel). In the case of MJD1, the first shifted band in the HA Western blot did not react with antibodies to FLAG ubiquitin indicating that the altered mobility was not due to ubiquitylation. Although MEKK1 did react with α-FLAG antibody indicating it was ubiquitylated, it was not possible to resolve a molecular weight shift due to the size of MEKK1. In contrast, KIAA1386 was not ubiquitylated. Multiple shifted forms of MJD1, Hrs, epsin, HSJ1, and MEKK1 were detected with antibodies to FLAG-ubiquitin suggesting that these UIMs promoted polyubiquitylation. To determine whether these higher molecular weight forms represented polyubiquitylation, multiubiquitylation, or a combination of these two possibilities, the HA-tagged full-length proteins were transiently co-expressed with FLAG epitope-tagged ubiquitin devoid of Lys (UbΔΚ) and thus no longer capable of forming chains. Ubiquitylation of the full-length proteins was decreased in cells expressing UbΔK indicating that epsin and Hrs as well as MJD1, MEKK1, and HSJ1 were at least partially polyubiquitylated. Longer exposures uncovered shifted bands with the expression of UbΔK suggesting that these proteins may also be modified by the attachment of multiple monoubiquitins (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Furthermore a decrease in the level of monoubiquitylation of several of these proteins was observed with the UbΔΚ as compared with UbWT suggesting that polyubiquitin chains are required for monoubiquitylation. These differences in ubiquitylation were not due to differences in the steady state levels of the mono-UbWT and mono-UbΔK as both were expressed equally (Fig. 2C). Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor (MG132) did not alter the levels of the ubiquitylated or non-ubiquitylated UIM-containing proteins (data not shown) consistent with previous studies (6Katz M.

Following immunoprecipitation with HA affinity beads in the presence of SDS and deoxycholate, proteins were fractionated on gels, transferred to Immobilon P filters, and probed with either α-FLAG (top) or α-HA (bottom). *, longer exposures (B) revealed ubiquitylation of epsin and HSJ1 in both lanes, although the levels were lower in the UbΔK samples. Although the levels of UbWT and UbΔK expression were equivalent with a given protein, the expression of these two vary between the different UIM proteins. C, to verify equal expression and lack of ubiquitin chain formation by the mutant ubiquitin, FLAG-UbWT and -UbΔK were expressed in 293T cells, and equivalent amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot using the FLAG antibody.View Large"

Two families of these proteins have been described and are delineated by the cofactor that each employs in catalysis. These are the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent deaminases and the deaminases that are activated in vitro by iron and dithiothreitol. In contrast to the enzymes that employ pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, detailed physical and mechanistic characterization of the iron-dependent deaminases is limited, primarily because of their extreme instability. We report here the characterization of l-serine deaminase from Escherichia coli, which is the product of the sdaA gene. When purified anaerobically, the isolated protein contains 1.86 ± 0.46 eq of iron and 0.670 ± 0.019 eq of sulfide per polypeptide and displays a UV-visible spectrum that is consistent with a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Reconstitution of the protein with iron and sulfide generates considerably more of the cluster, and treatment of the reconstituted protein with dithionite gives rise to an axial EPR spectrum, displaying g∥ = 2.03 and g⊥ = 1.93. Mössbauer spectra of the 57Fe-reconstituted protein reveal that the majority of the iron is in the form of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters, as evidenced by the typical Mössbauer parameters-isomer shift, δ = 0.47 mm/s, quadrupole splitting of ΔEQ = 1.14 mm/s, and a diamagnetic (S = 0) ground state. Treatment of the dithionite-reduced protein with l-serine results in a slight broadening of the feature at g = 2.03 in the EPR spectrum of the protein, and a dramatic loss in signal intensity, suggesting that the amino acid interacts directly with the cluster. l-Serine deaminases catalyze the deamination of l-serine, producing pyruvate and ammonia.

As described in the Swiss-Prot data base, these enzymes fall into two families, the serine/threonine deaminases (EC 4.3.1.19) and the bacterial l-serine deaminases (EC 4.3.1.17). The first of these, the serine/threonine deaminases, require pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a cofactor in catalysis. Enzymes within this family that have been characterized to any significant extent include the mammalian liver l-serine deaminase, which serves a gluconeogenic function (1Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D. Irreverre F. Laster L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 19: 665-670Google Scholar, 2Ogawa H. Gomi T. Konishi K. Date T. Nakashima H. Nose K. Matsuda Y. Peraino C. Pitot H.C. Fujioka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15818-15823Google Scholar), and the biosynthetic threonine deaminase (EC 4.3.1.19), which is encoded by the ilvA gene of Escherichia coli. This enzyme deaminates either serine or threonine (3Umbarger H.E. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1973; 37: 349-395Google Scholar) and is essential for isoleucine biosynthesis. A second threonine deaminase, the biodegradative enzyme, which is encoded by the tdcB gene of E. coli, uses the same cofactor, as does d-serine deaminase of E. coli (4.3.1.18) (4Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4629-4635Google Scholar, 5Dowhan Jr., W. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4618-4628Google Scholar, 6Marceau M. McFall E. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16926-16933Google Scholar). Moreover, serine is deaminated by enzymes of varying physiological function, including cystathionine γ-synthase (7Brown E.A. D'Ari R. Newman E.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1017-1023Google Scholar) and the β subunit of tryptophan synthase (8Yanofsky C. Crawford I.P. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 1-31Google Scholar). The mechanism of all these enzymes is well understood. The role of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor is to facilitate removal of the α-proton of the bound amino acid, allowing for a β-elimination of the hydroxyl group as water. Tautomerization of the resulting α-aminoacrylate results in 2-iminopropionic acid, which is hydrolyzed to ammonia and pyruvate (9Davis L. Metzler D.E. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 33-74Google Scholar). By contrast, the bacterial l-serine deaminases (LSDs) 1The abbreviations used are: LSD, l-serine deaminase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; EPPS, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonate; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; Fe/S, iron-sulfur; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; SAM, s-adenosyl-l-methionine; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. are activated by iron and are not as well characterized (10Grabowski R.

This family of enzymes is exclusively prokaryotic and wide-spread in bacteria, although not omnipresent. In fact, many bacteria elaborate one to three LSDs. In E. coli these proteins are encoded by the sdaA, sdaB, and tdcG genes (12Hesslinger C. Fairhurst S.A. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 477-492Google Scholar, 13Su H.S. Lang B.F. Newman E.B. J.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 777-784Google Scholar); the corresponding protein products are designated as LSD1, LSD2, and TdcG, respectively. All three proteins are very similar in primary structure; LSD2 and TdcG exhibit 77 and 78% identity with LSD1. In contrast to LSD1 and LSD2, TdcG is synthesized only during anaerobic growth (12Hesslinger C. Fairhurst S.A. Sawers G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 477-492Google Scholar). The manner in which expression and/or function of these enzymes is regulated is known in some detail, but the mechanism of catalysis is not. LSD1 has been moderately characterized (13Su H.S. Lang B.F. Newman E.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5095-5102Google Scholar, 15Su H. Moniakis J. Newman E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 521-527Google Scholar, 16Newman E.B. Walker C. Ziegler-Skylakakis K. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 723-728Google Scholar). It contains 454 amino acids, including 9 cysteines (13Su H.S. Lang B.F. Newman E.B. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5095-5102Google Scholar). When purified aerobically, the enzyme is inactive until incubated with iron and DTT under aerobic conditions. These characteristics make it very similar to the LSDs from Clostridium acidiurici (17Carter J.E. Sagers R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 757-763Google Scholar), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (18Grabowski R. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 89-94Google Scholar), and Clostridium propionicum (19Hofmeister A.E.M. Grabowski R. Linder D. Buckel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 341-349Google Scholar), which are all activated in the same manner. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies on the P. asaccharolyticus enzyme indicate the presence of [3Fe-4S]+ clusters (20Hofmeister A.E.M. Albracht S.P. Buckel W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 416-418Google Scholar). It is believed, however, that the catalytically active form of the enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster, in light of the striking similarities between the proposed reaction mechanism of the iron-dependent LSDs and aconitase, which has been studied in detail using a variety of spectroscopic techniques (10Grabowski R. Hofmeister A.E. Buckel W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 297-300Google Scholar, 21Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Google Scholar). Herein, we use a variety of spectroscopic methods to show that treatment of LSD1 with iron and sulfide results in formation of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on the protein and that this state of the protein is essential for catalysis. Reconstituted LSD1 catalyzes the deamination of l-serine with a first-order rate constant (kcat) of 436 s–1, and a Km value of 2.67 ± 0.25 mm. It will also deaminate l-threonine and l-allo-threonine, albeit with greatly reduced efficiency; however, d-serine and l-cysteine are not substrates but serve as competitive inhibitors. Additionally, analyses of EPR spectra recorded on the dithionite-reduced protein in the presence of various substrates and inhibitors are consistent with a direct role in catalysis for the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster as opposed to a simple structural element. Materials—l-Serine and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from ICN Biomedicals Inc. l-Threonine, l-cysteine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium sulfide (nonahydrate), molecular weight standards for gel filtration, and ferric chloride were obtained from Sigma. Sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite), potassium ferricyanide, and l-allo-threonine were obtained from Aldrich. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard and the Bradford reagent for protein quantification were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Tryptone and yeast extract were obtained from Marcor Development (Carlstadt, NJ) and Biospringer USA (Milwaukee, WI), respectively. 57Fe metal (97–98%) was obtained from Pennwood Chemicals (Great Neck, NY). It was washed with CHCl3 and dissolved with heating in an anaerobic solution of 1 m H2SO4 (1.5 mol of H2SO4 per mol of 57Fe). Upon dissolution, the pH of the solution was raised to ∼4.5 by the addition of solid sodium bicarbonate immediately before the reconstitution procedure. Spectroscopic Methods—UV-visible spectra were recorded on Cary 50 or Cary 300 spectrometers (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA), employing the associated WinUV software package. The Cary 300 was equipped with a 6 × 6 Peltier-thermostattable multicell holder and an associated temperature controller. Low temperature X-band EPR spectra were recorded in perpendicular mode on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) ESP300 spectrometer equipped with an ER 041 MR microwave bridge and a 4102ST resonator. Sample temperature was maintained with an ITC503S temperature controller and an ESR900 liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instruments, Concord, MA). Spin concentration was determined by double integration of the sample spectrum obtained under non-saturating conditions and comparing the resulting intensity to that of a standard (1 mm CuSO4, 10 mm EDTA) obtained under identical conditions. General spectral manipulations were performed on personal computers using the WinEPR software package (Bruker) or the IGOR Pro software package (Wavemetrics). Mössbauer spectra were recorded on spectrometers from WEB research (Edina, MN) operating in the constant acceleration mode in a transmission geometry. Spectra were recorded with the temperature of the sample maintained at 4.2 K. For low field spectra, the sample was kept inside an SVT-400 Dewar from Janis (Wilmington, MA), and a magnetic field of 40 millitesla was applied parallel to the γ-beam. For high field spectra, the sample was kept inside a 12SVT Dewar (Janis), which houses a superconducting magnet that allows for application of variable magnetic fields between 0 and 8 tesla parallel to the γ-beam. The quoted isomer shifts are relative to the centroid of the spectrum of a metallic foil of α-Fe at room temperature. Data analysis was performed using the program WMOSS from WEB research. Analytical Procedures and Assays—Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye-staining procedure with BSA as the standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). As determined in this work, this method overestimates the true concentration of LSD1 by a factor of 1.35. Routine chemical analyses of iron and sulfide were carried out by the methods of Beinert (23Kennedy M.C. Kent T.A. Emptage M. Merkle H. Beinert H. Münck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14463-14471Google Scholar, 24Beinert H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 435-445Google Scholar, 25Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Google Scholar). The method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar) was used to establish an extinction coefficient for apo-LSD1, which in turn was used to correct the Bradford dye-staining protein assay. Routine gel-filtration of LSD1 was carried out in a Coy Laboratory Products (Grass Lake, MI) anaerobic chamber using Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Biosciences). When it was necessary to concentrate the protein, it was carried out using an Amicon stirred-cell ultrafiltration device (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in combination with a YM-10 membrane, which has a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. Ultrafiltration was carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber by threading the tubing from the nitrogen source through one of the chamber's ports. Overexpression and Purification of LSD1—A 200-ml overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) containing plasmid psdaAH6 in terrific broth (100 μg ml–1 ampicillin) was used to inoculate 16 liters of the same media, which was divided evenly among four 6-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. Plasmid psdaAH6 contains the sdaA gene cloned as a fusion construct with a carboxyl-terminal 6× histidine tag that is separated from the last amino acid of the protein by a linker of 2 amino acid residues. The cultures were grown at 37 °C with gentle shaking (200 rpm) and induced at an A600 of 0.5 by addition of solid isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 400 μm. At induction, solid FeCl3 was also added to each flask to a final concentration of 50 μm. Expression of the sdaA gene was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C, after which, the cultures were placed in an ice-water bath for 30 min. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g and 4 °C, yielding ∼30 g of cells from 16 liters of cell culture after freezing in liquid nitrogen. LSD1 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All steps were carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of N2 and H2 (95%/5%), wherein the O2 concentration was maintained below 1 ppm via the use of palladium catalysts. Steps involving centrifugation were carried out outside of the anaerobic chamber; however, samples were loaded into appropriate centrifuge bottles and tightly sealed before removing them. In a typical purification, 30 g of cells was thawed in 60 ml of Buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm imidazole) and allowed to incubate with lysozyme (1 mg ml–1) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequent to chilling on ice, the cells were lysed by sonic disruption in 4 × 1-min bursts, and the lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (2.5 × 7 cm) that was equilibrated in Buffer A, and the column was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A containing 10% glycerol and 40 mm imidazole. Finally, the protein was eluted with Buffer A containing 10% glycerol and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions that displayed a brown color were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon stirred-cell and exchanged into Buffer B (50 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) by anaerobic gel filtration. The protein was routinely frozen in small aliquots and stored in liquid N2 until ready for use. Reconstitution of Serine Deaminase—Reconstitution of LSD1 with iron and sulfide was carried out inside of the anaerobic chamber with buffers and solutions that were prepared with deoxygenated water. A typical reconstitution reaction contained 100 μm LSD1, and 8-fold molar excesses of FeCl3 and Na2S in a final volume of 2 ml. The protein was initially treated with a 50-fold molar excess of DTT for 10 min on ice. The FeCl3 was added, and then a solution of Na2S was added dropwise over 10 min. The mixture was allowed to stir gently on ice for 4 h in the anaerobic chamber. It was then placed in centrifuge tubes, capped, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. It was brought back into the anaerobic chamber, and the supernatant was removed and exchanged into Buffer B by anaerobic gel filtration. Activity Determination for Serine Deaminase—LSD1 was first diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm in Buffer B containing 50% glycerol. A typical reaction contained in a final volume of 1 ml: 0.2 mm NADH, 10 units of LDH, 0–20 mm l-serine, 100 mm EPPS, pH 8.0, and 55 nm LSD1. The reaction mixture was prepared inside the anaerobic chamber; all of its components were anaerobic except for LDH. However, the volume of LDH added to the reaction mixture was 1% of the total volume. The reaction mixture, excluding LSD1, was incubated for 3–5 min at 37 °C in a septum-sealed anaerobic cuvette (Starna, Atascadero, CA), and the reaction was initiated by injection of LSD1 via a gas-tight syringe. Enzyme turnover was monitored by a time-dependent decrease in absorption at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6.22 × 103m–1 cm–1), which is due to NADH oxidation. One unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of NAD+ produced per minute. When turnover with l-threonine, l-cysteine, l-allo-threonine, or d-serine was monitored, the concentration of LSD1 in the assay was increased to 5.5 μm. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax were obtained from fits of initial rate data as a function of serine concentration according to Equation 1. In some instances, data were fitted to Equation 2, which accounts for substrate cooperativity. When assays were carried out in the presence of inhibitors, the data were fitted to Equation 3 by multiple non-linear regression using the GraFit software program (27Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit Version 5. Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK2001Google Scholar). This equation describes competitive inhibition. v=Vmax·[S]/(Km+[S]) (Eq. 1) v=Vmax·[S]n/(K+[S]n) (Eq. 2) v=Vmax·[S]/(Km+(1+(I/KI))·[S])) (Eq. 3) Molecular Sieve Chromatography of LSD1—Molecular sieve chromatography of LSD1 was performed under anaerobic conditions with an ΔKTA (Amersham Biosciences) fast-performance liquid chromatography system, which was maintained inside a Coy anaerobic chamber. The fast-performance liquid chromatography system was equipped with a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) and was controlled with the associated software program UNICORN, which was also used for data collection and analysis. The column was equilibrated in an anaerobic solution of Buffer B, and samples (250 μm) and standards (2–10 mg ml–1) were chromatographed at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 over a time span of 120 min. The proteins, cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa), were used to generate a standard curve of known molecular masses, and the void volume (V0) of the column was determined using blue dextran (2000 kDa). The elution volumes (Ve) of the standards were obtained, and the ratios of VeV0–1 were plotted against the log of their respective molecular masses. The standard curve was then used to extrapolate the apparent molecular weight of reconstituted LSD1 from its elution volume. Preparation of Samples for EPR and Mössbauer Spectroscopy—Samples of LSD1 suitable for EPR or Mössbauer spectroscopy were prepared inside of the anaerobic chamber. EPR samples contained 200–300 μm enzyme in Buffer B, were treated with 2 mm (final concentration) sodium dithionite, and frozen immediately in cold isopentane (–150 °C) sitting in a Dewar of liquid nitrogen. In some samples, l-serine, l-threonine, or l-cysteine (20 mm each) was added to the reduced protein before freezing. In all cases, the amount of time that elapsed between the addition of dithionite (and the substrate when appropriate) and the freezing of the sample was less than 30 s. Mössbauer spectra were recorded on proteins that contained 57Fe in place of natural-abundance iron. In all samples, the 57Fe was incorporated into the protein via reconstitution, as described above, and samples contained 250–350 μm protein, and 20 mm l-threonine when appropriate. Samples were frozen within 30 s after adding the substrate to the enzyme. Purification and Characterization of Serine Deaminase—The iron-dependent serine deaminases have been reported to be unstable, losing activity quickly during purification, and to some extent, even in the cell (28Hofmeister A.E.M. Textor S. Buckel W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4937-4941Google Scholar, 29Newman E.B. Kapoor V. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1292-1297Google Scholar, 30Newman E.B. Dumont D. Walker C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1270-1275Google Scholar). To maximize purification of active enzyme, the protein was expressed as a fusion construct with a carboxyl-terminal 6× histidine appendage and purified under anaerobic conditions inside an anaerobic chamber. The eluted protein was light brown in color, and its UV-visible spectrum displayed features, although not prominent, that are consistent with the presence of an Fe/S cluster (Fig. 1, solid line). Among these features, the shoulder at 320 nm and the hump at 416 nm are the most defining, as is the broad tailing that extends beyond 700 nm. An extinction coefficient was determined using apo-LSD1 and the procedure of Gill and von Hippel and was used to correct the Bradford dye-binding protein assay. It was found that the Bradford assay, using BSA as a standard, overestimates the concentration of LSD1 by a factor of 1.35. Analysis of subsequent aliquots of the as-isolated protein indicated the presence of 1.86 ± 0.46 eq of iron and 0.670 ± 0.019 eq of sulfide per polypeptide using the Bradford correction factor. Reconstitution of Serine Deaminase—Treatment of as-isolated LSD1 with 5 mm DTT and 8 eq each of FeCl3 and Na2S resulted in a pronounced change in its color after anaerobic gel filtration, affording a protein that was intensely brown. Analytical methods revealed that the reconstituted protein contained (8.07 ± 0.03) iron and (7.44 ± 0.46) S2– per monomer. The quoted uncertainties are the standard deviation of three independent analyses, and they reflect the individual uncertainties of the protein concentration and the iron and sulfide concentration. The UV-visible spectrum of the reconstituted protein is also shown in Fig. 1 (dashed line). It displays prominent features at 316 and 407 nm. Importantly, the ratio of the feature at 278 nm to that at 407 nm (2.56) decreased significantly from its value in the as-isolated protein (8.33). These features, in combination with the overall spectral envelope of the protein, are most consistent with the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters upon reconstitution, although it must be emphasized that the types and relative amounts of different Fe/S cluster species cannot be determined with great accuracy from UV-visible spectra. To quantitatively determine the composition of the Fe/S cluster(s) in reconstituted LSD1, Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopic experiments were carried out as described below. Spectroscopic Characterization of Reconstituted Serine Deaminase—Shown in Fig. 2A is the Mössbauer spectrum of 57Fe-reconstituted LSD1 recorded at 4.2 K in an externally applied magnetic field of 40 millitesla oriented parallel to the γ-beam. The prominent features of this spectrum are two sharp lines of similar intensity at –0.13 and +1 mm/s, and a broad peak at 2.7 mm/s. In addition, there is a featureless component extending from –6 to +6 mm/s, and a pronounced shoulder at 0.55 mm/s, which is denoted by an arrow. The two lines at –0.13 and +1 mm/s belong to a quadrupole doublet of isomer shift, δ = 0.47 mm/s, and quadrupole splitting, ΔEQ = 1.14 mm/s. These parameters are consistent with the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters associated with the protein. The shoulder at +0.55 mm/s is at a position that is typical of the high energy line of a quadrupole doublet originating from [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters, thus raising the possibility that this cluster form is also present in the sample. The broad component ranging from –6 to +6 mm/s, and the peak at 2.7 mm/s, are often caused by adventitiously bound iron species in samples of reconstituted Fe/S proteins. Alternatively, these features could arise from paramagnetic Fe/S cluster species, such as [2Fe-2S]+, [3Fe-4S]+, and [4Fe-4S]+ clusters. It is not possible to distinguish and quantify small amounts of these Fe/S cluster forms using Mössbauer spectroscopy alone if they are present. However, the [2Fe-2S]+, [3Fe-4S]+, and [4Fe-4S]+ clusters all have an S = 1/2 electronic ground state and exhibit characteristic EPR spectra. Consequently, we recorded the EPR spectrum of reconstituted LSD1 in the absence of dithionite. The spectrum reveals the presence of a small fraction of [3Fe-4S]+ clusters, which amounts to 0.02 eq of spin per polypeptide, corresponding to 0.7% of the total iron in the sample (Fig. 3, inset). Such small quantities are beyond the detection limit of Mössbauer spectroscopy and can be neglected for the data analysis. The characteristic features of [2Fe-2S]+ and [4Fe-4S]+ clusters are not observed in the EPR spectrum of reconstituted LSD1 in the absence of dithionite. Therefore, the broad absorption in the Mössbauer spectrum is attributed to adventitiously bound Fe.Fig. 3X-band EPR spectra of reconstituted LSD1 reduced with 2 mm dithionite. Conditions of measurement were: microwave power, 5 milliwatts; receiver gain, 2 × 104; modulation amplitude, 10 G; temperature, 13 K; microwave frequency, 9.65 GHz. Inset: reconstituted LSD1 before reduction with dithionite, obtained under identical conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the parameters and relative amount of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, and to assess the presence of the [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters more rigorously, the spectral envelope was analyzed by fitting the region from –1 to +2 mm/s. Initially, we fitted the data to only one quadrupole doublet; however, the fit becomes poor at ∼0.5 mm/s, which corresponds to the location of the shoulder. Inclusion of a second quadrupole doublet significantly improves the quality of the fit. The more intense quadrupole doublet accounts for 50 ± 5% of the total absorption and has parameters, δ = 0.47 mm/s and ΔEQ = 1.14 mm/s, that are indicative of the configuration [4Fe-4S]2+. The less intense quadrupole doublet (10 ± 5% of the total absorption) has parameters, δ = 0.28 mm/s and ΔEQ = 0.59 mm/s, that are indicative of the configuration [2Fe-2S]2+. We emphasize that the parameters for the latter component have a greater uncertainty, because its spectral features are overshadowed by the absorption features emanating from the [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters as well as the adventitiously bound Fe, of which the exact shape is not known. Shown as a solid line overlaid with the experimental data in Fig. 2A is the result of the least squares fit; the individual spectral components of the [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters are plotted above the data as dashed and dotted lines, respectively. To substantiate the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters in reconstituted LSD1, we recorded a Mössbauer spectrum in an externally applied field of 8 tesla oriented parallel to the γ-beam (Fig. 2B). [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters have diamagnetic (S = 0) ground states, resulting in no internal magnetic fields at 4.2 K. Therefore, it is expected that the effective magnetic field at the 57Fe nuclei would equal the externally applied field. The solid line overlaid with the experimental data in Fig. 2B is a simulation using the parameters described above and assuming diamagnetism (S = 0). The individual components are shown as dashed ([4Fe-4S]2+) and dotted lines ([2Fe-2S]2+) above the data. The quality of the simulation is excellent, and it corroborates the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ and [2Fe-2S]2+ clusters. EPR spectra of the reconstituted enzyme are consistent with the configurations and stoichiometries of Fe/S species determined by Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the absence of dithionite, the enzyme displays a weak and fairly isotropic signal centered at g = 2.019, which accounts for 0.02 eq of spin and which is not observed at temperatures above 50 K at 5-milliwatt power (Fig. 3, inset), suggesting that the signal emanates from [3Fe-4S]+ clusters. Other Fe/S cluster species are not detected. From the analyses of the Mössbauer and EPR spectra, it is possible to determine the stoichiometries of the Fe/S clusters present in recon"

Delineation of themes for agonist binding and activation of these receptors will facilitate the rational design of receptor-active drugs. We reported previously that a photolabile residue within the carboxyl-terminal half (residue 26) and mid-region (residue 16) of calcitonin covalently label the extracellular amino-terminal domain of this receptor (Dong, M., Pinon, D.

Chimeric receptor studies support the importance of this region and suggest important contributions of extracellular loop domains. To examine whether other parts of the ligand may contact those loops, we developed another probe that has its photolabile site of labeling within the amino-terminal half in position 8 of the ligand.

It bound specifically and saturably (Ki = 14.3 ± 1.9 nm) and was able to efficiently label the calcitonin receptor. By purification, specific cleavage, and sequencing of labeled wild-type and mutant calcitonin receptors, the site of attachment was identified as residue Leu368 within the third extracellular loop of the receptor, a domain distinct from that labeled by previous probes.

CT acts on bone and kidney to maintain calcium homeostasis and is also present in the central nervous system, where it has anorectic and analgesic effects (3Sexton P.M. Mol.

It has been used therapeutically for the treatment of Paget's disease, the hypercalcemia associated with certain types of tumors, and osteoporosis (1Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med.

Although residues throughout the entire length have been demonstrated to be critical for its biological activity, the amino-terminal residues of CT contain key determinants for its receptor agonist selectivity (1Sexton P.M.

Although they have topology similar to that of class A receptors, members of class B family share less than 12% amino acid identity with the more extensively studied receptors in the class A family. Class B receptors have distinct signature sequences, including a long complex amino-terminal domain with six conserved cysteine residues that are believed to be involved in intradomain disulfide bonds critical for establishing functional receptor conformation (6Qi L.J.

Members included in this family are receptors for moderately large peptides having diffuse pharmacophoric domains, such as secretin, calcitonin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and parathyroid hormone, sharing 30 to 50% homology with each other.The unique amino-terminal domain of the CT receptor has been shown to be critical for agonist binding and receptor activation using chimeric receptor studies (11Bergwitz C. Gardella T.J. Flannery M.R. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Goldring S.R. Juppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Google Scholar, 12Stroop S.D. Kuestner R.E. Serwold T.F. Chen L. Moore E.E.

This represents a consistent theme for other class B family members (14Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14394-14398Google Scholar, 15Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M.

Journot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22146-22151Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling is a more direct approach for exploration of spatial approximations between residues within a ligand and within its receptor. Using this approach, we have recently demonstrated that probes incorporated a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) residue in the carboxyl-terminal half and mid-region of the human CT peptide ligand, in positions 16 and 26, covalently label receptor residues Phe137 and Thr30, respectively. Both are within the extracellular amino terminus of the CT receptor, with the former adjacent to the first transmembrane segment and the latter within the distal amino-terminal tail of the receptor (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar). Pham et al. (21Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Google Scholar) recently reported that the ligand binding domain for a photolabile probe incorporating a Bpa in position 19 was localized to a segment (Cys134-Lys141) within the receptor amino terminus that included residue Phe137, a site labeled by our position 16 probe (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar). All these data consistently support a critical role of the amino terminus of the CT receptor in ligand binding.However, chimeric receptor studies have also suggested that the extracellular loop domains of the CT receptor play a role complementary to the amino terminus in agonist binding and receptor activation (13Stroop S.D. Nakamuta H. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. Epand R.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4752-4756Google Scholar), but no such regions of the CT receptor have yet been shown to be spatially approximated with the ligand using photoaffinity labeling. To determine whether other portions of CT might contact these loop domains, we developed another probe in which its photolabile residue is closer to the amino terminus of the ligand, in position 8. This probe, (Bpa8)human calcitonin-32 (Bpa8 probe), was developed and characterized as a fully efficacious agonist that bound to its receptor saturably and specifically and that efficiently covalently labeled the CT receptor in a single distinct domain. This domain was identified as the third extracellular loop of the CT receptor by chemical cleavage of labeled wild-type and mutant receptors, and the labeled residue was identified as Leu368 using radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing. This site is distinct from sites of labeling with all previous probes (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar, 21Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Google Scholar). This new pair of residue-residue approximation should contribute substantially to our understanding of the natural ligand-binding region of the CT receptor. Analogous observations with the structurally related secretin (22Dong M. Li Z. Pinon D.I. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2894-2903Google Scholar) and parathyroid hormone (23Bisello A. Adams A.E. Mierke D.F. Pellegrini M. Rosenblatt M. Suva L.J. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22498-22505Google Scholar, 24Behar V. Bisello A. Bitan G. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9-17Google Scholar) receptors may suggest a common mechanism for ligand binding and activation of the class B family of G protein-coupled receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human CT, human parathyroid hormone, and human glucagon-like peptide-1 were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), solid phase oxidant N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide and m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester were purchased from Pierce. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads were from Sigma. Rat secretin and endoglycosidase F were prepared in our laboratory (25Pearson R.K. Miller L.J. Hadac E.M. Powers S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Google Scholar, 26Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Google Scholar). All other reagents were analytical grade.Peptides—The Bpa8 probe was designed to incorporate a photolabile Bpa into position 8 for covalent labeling of its receptor. This position has been demonstrated to be well tolerated for replacement by an Ile residue (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar). The Bpa8 probe contained a naturally occurring Tyr at position 12, acting as a site of radioiodination. This probe was synthesized by manual solid-phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously, with their chemical identities being established by mass spectrometry. The photolabile Bpa8 probe and natural human CT that was used as the radioligand for receptor binding studies were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na125I upon exposure to N-chloro-benzenesulfonamide for 15 s and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography to yield specific radioactivity of 2,000 Ci/mmol (27Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Google Scholar).Receptor Sources—The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line stably expressing the human CT receptor isoform II (HEK-CTR) that we used previously (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar) were again used as the source of receptors for the current study. Cells were cultured at 37 °Cina5%CO2 environment on Falcon tissue culture plasticware in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal clone-2 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). They were passaged twice a week and lifted mechanically before use. In this work, it was necessary to develop a new CT receptor mutant that eliminated a naturally occurring site for CNBr cleavage in the third extracellular loop of the receptor. This represented Met376 to Leu (M376L) receptor construct. In addition, another CT receptor construct was generated in which Leu368 was mutated to Ala (L368A), representing mutation of the site of labeling by the Bpa8 probe. Both mutants were prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, with the products verified by direct DNA sequencing (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Both were expressed transiently on COS cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (15Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Google Scholar). Cells were harvested mechanically 72 h after transfection. Plasma membranes were prepared from the above receptor-expressing cells using methods reported previously (29Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Google Scholar).Biological Activity Assay—This was performed by measuring the intracellular cAMP accumulation in HEK-CTR cells in response to stimulation by CT or the Bpa8 probe, using a competitive-binding assay (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). In brief, cells grown in 24-well plates were stimulated by increasing concentrations (0–1 μm) of CT or the Bpa8 probe for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm CaCl2) containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The incubation was stopped by adding ice-cold 6% perchloric acid. After adjusting the pH to 6 with KHCO3, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were used in the assay, as described previously (30Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a Beckman Coulter LS6000 liquid scintillation counter. Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. This assay was also used to functionally characterize the new receptor mutants expressed transiently on COS cells.Ligand Binding—Binding of the Bpa8 probe to the CT receptor was characterized in a standard assay using HEK-CTR cells. In brief, approximately 50,000–100,000 cells were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand, 125I-human CT-32 (5 pm), in the presence of increasing concentrations (0–1 μm) of the Bpa8 probe, CT, or other peptide ligands, for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES medium containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Bound and free radioligand were separated by centrifugation and washing, with bound radioactivity quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm CT and represented <20% of total binding. The same assay was also used to characterize the binding activity of the new receptor mutants transiently expressed on COS cells. Binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the nonlinear regression analysis routine for radioligand binding in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding kinetics was determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (31Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar).Photoaffinity Labeling—Covalent labeling of the CT receptor was achieved as described previously (20Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of enriched receptor-bearing membranes from HEK-CTR cells were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-(Bpa8)human calcitonin-32 in the presence of increasing concentrations of CT (from 0 to 1 μm) or other peptide ligands, in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. This was then photolyzed for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps. Membranes were then washed, solubilized in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To prepare labeled receptor in larger scale for further peptide mapping, larger amount of receptor-bearing membranes (200 μg) and 125I-(Bpa8)human calcitonin-32 (0.5 nm) were incubated in the absence of competing CT before photolysis.Peptide Mapping to Identify the Domain of Labeling—Affinity-labeled receptor was purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by elution, lyophilization, and ethanol precipitation. For selected experiments, the affinity-labeled receptor was deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F, as we reported previously (33Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Google Scholar). Purified, affinity-labeled native and deglycosylated receptors were subject to CNBr cleavage using methods that we have described previously (33Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12988-12993Google Scholar). The products of cleavage were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES buffer system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and labeled bands are visualized by autoradiography. The apparent molecular masses of labeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of Multimark protein standards (Invitrogen) versus the log of their apparent masses.Radiochemical Sequencing to Identify the Site of Labeling—The radiochemically pure fragment resulting from CNBr cleavage of the labeled M376L mutant CT receptor was immobilized through thiol groups of its Cys residues using the bifunctional cross-linker m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester and N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads. Cycles of Edman degradation were repeated manually up to seven cycles, in a manner that has been previously reported in detail (34Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Google Scholar), and the radioactivity released in each cycle was quantified in a γ-spectrometer.RESULTSProbe Characterization—The Bpa8 probe was designed to incorporate a photolabile Bpa within its amino-terminal half, in the position of Met8 (Fig. 1). It was synthesized by manual solid phase techniques and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. It was characterized to demonstrate the expected molecular mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2, this probe bound saturably and specifically to CT receptor-bearing HEK-CTR cells, although it had affinity lower than natural CT (Ki values: Bpa8 probe, 14.3 ± 1.9 nm; CT, 1.1 ± 0.1 nm; Bmax, 103,000 ± 10,000 binding sites/cell). As expected, other distinct peptides in the calcitonin family had not competed for binding using concentrations as high as 1 μm (Fig. 2). The Bpa8 probe was a full agonist, stimulating intracellular cAMP accumulation in HEK-CTR cells in a concentration-dependent manner (basal, 27 ± 5 pmol/million cells; maximal, 235 ± 5 pmol/million cells), although with lower efficacy than natural CT (Bpa8 probe, EC50 = 563 ± 67 pm; CT, EC50 = 26 ± 6 pm; Fig. 2).Fig. 2Characterization of the Bpa8 probe. Left, abilities of increasing concentrations of natural CT or the Bpa8 probe or other related peptides, human parathyroid hormone (PTH), secretin (Sec) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), to compete for binding of the radioligand, 125I-human CT-32, to HEK-CTR cells. Values are calculated as percentages of maximal saturable binding observed in the absence of competitor. They are expressed as means ± S.E. of duplicate data from three independent experiments. Right, both natural CT and the Bpa8 probe stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulations in HEK-CTR cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Photoaffinity Labeling of the CT Receptor—The Bpa8 probe was next used to explore its ability to covalently label the CT receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, this probe covalently labeled the CT receptor saturably and specifically, and the labeling was inhibited by increasing concentrations of natural CT (IC50 = 2.1 ± 0.4 nm) but not by other related peptides, such as parathyroid hormone, secretin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 at concentrations as high as 1 μm (Fig. 3). Consistent with our previous work on labeling of this receptor with the Bpa16 and Bpa26 probes, the labeled receptor migrated at approximate Mr 97,000 and shifted to Mr 52,000 after deglycosylation. This band was not present in samples prepared from non-receptor-bearing parental HEK cell membranes. The high efficiency for covalent labeling of the CT receptor with this probe provided the opportunity for the identification of the specific site of receptor labeling by this probe.Fig. 3Photoaffinity labeling of the CT receptor. Shown are typical autoradiographs of SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels used to separate products of affinity labeling of HEK-CTR cell membranes in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of competing unlabeled CT (top) or other related peptides (human parathyroid hormone (PTH), secretin (Sec), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)) (middle). The affinity-labeled CT receptor migrated at approximate Mr 97,000 and shifted to Mr 52,000 after deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F (EF) (upper). No radioactive bands were observed in affinity-labeled non-receptor bearing HEK cell membranes (top). Bottom, densitometric analyses of such receptor competition labeling performed in three similar experiments (means ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Active Site Identification—To gain an initial indication of receptor domains of labeling with the Bpa8 probe, we first chose to cleave the labeled receptor by CNBr that we have used successfully for the secretin (22Dong M.

CNBr cleaves at the carboxyl side of Met residues within a protein, and its cleavage of the CT receptor would theoretically yield 15 fragments ranging from 0.1 to 11 kDa, two of which contain potential glycosylation sites. As shown in Fig. 4, CNBr cleavage of the CT receptor labeled with the Bpa8 probe resulted in a single band migrating at approximate Mr 4,500 that migrated distinctly from the radioiodinated free probe (Mr 3,500). Furthermore, deglycosylation using endoglycosidase F did not change the migration of the fragment, indicating the labeled fragment was not glycosylated. Considering the molecular mass of the attached probe (3,538 Da), the fragments Asp49-Met59 at the amino terminus and Leu368-Met376 within the third extracellular loop domain of the receptor (Fig. 4, highlighted in black circles) were felt to represent the best candidates for the domain of labeling with the Bpa8 probe.Fig. 4CNBr cleavage of the affinity-labeled CT receptor. Left, theoretical sites of CNBr cleavage within the CT receptor, with the masses of the predicted fragments. Right, representative autoradiograph of a 10% NuPAGE gel used to separate the products of CNBr cleavage of the native and deglycosylated CT receptor that had been labeled with the Bpa8 probe. As shown, such cleavage yielded a band migrating at approximate Mr 4,500 that was not affected by treatment with endoglycosidase F (EF). This band migrated slightly slower than the free Bpa8 probe (Mr 3,500). Highlighted in bold circles in the diagram at left are two candidate fragments that best represent the receptor domain of labeling for the Bpa8 probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine which of these domains included the site of covalent attachment, a construct was generated in which Met376 was changed to Leu (M376L) to eliminate a site for CNBr cleavage. This receptor construct was expressed transiently on COS cells and functionally characterized in binding and cAMP assays. Data in Fig. 5 demonstrate that specific and high affinity binding (Ki = 0.96 ± 0.08 nm; 43,000 ± 8,000 binding sites/cell) as well as stimulation of cAMP accumulation (EC50 = 37 ± 5.1 pm) in response to CT in these cells were not significantly different from that in control cells expressing the wild-type receptor (binding, Ki = 1.1 ± 0.06 nm; 64,000 ± 6,000 binding sites/cell. cAMP stimulation, EC50 = 26 ± 3.3 pm). This construct was also affinity-labeled saturably and specifically with the Bpa8 probe, with the labeled band migrating on an SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel at approximate Mr 97,000 and shifting to Mr 52,000 after deglycosylation (Fig. 6). CNBr cleavage of the labeled intact receptor yielded a fragment migrating at approximate Mr 16,000 that did not further shift after treatment with endoglycosidase F (Fig. 6). This established definitively that the Leu368-Met376 segment within the third extracellular loop domain of the CT receptor included the site of covalent attachment of the Bpa8 probe.Fig. 5Characterization of the mutant CT receptor. The M376L CT receptor mutant was transiently expressed on COS cells and characterized for CT binding and CT-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells following the methods described in Fig. 2.

The R3 core biosynthesis (waa) genetic locus contains two genes, waaD and waaJ, that are predicted to encode glycosyltransferases involved in completion of the outer core. Through determination of the structures of the lipopolysaccharide core in precise mutants and biochemical analyses of enzyme activities, WaaJ was shown to be a UDP-glucose:(galactosyl) lipopolysaccharide α-1,2-glucosyltransferase, and WaaD was shown to be a UDP-glucose:(glucosyl)lipopolysaccharide α-1,2-glucosyltransferase. The residue added by WaaJ was identified as the ligation site for O polysaccharide, and this was confirmed by determination of the structure of the linkage region in serotype O157 lipopolysaccharide.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; core OS, core oligosaccharide; O-PS, O-antigenic polysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; Hep, l-glycero-d-manno-heptose; P, phosphoryl; Hex, hexose; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy; ESI-MS, electrospray mass spectroscopy; GalN, galactosamine; GlcN, glucosamine; HF, hydrofluoric acid; HPAEC, high performance anion-exchange chromatography; MS, mass spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; CE-MS, capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. is an essential component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and plays an important role in the interaction between the bacterium and its surrounding environment. In the LPS molecule of Enterobacteriaceae, the core oligosaccharide (core OS) links a hydrophobic and endotoxic lipid A molecule to the long chain O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS) (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the extent of conservation in the LPS molecule varies. At the two extremes are the highly conserved lipid A and the hypervariable O-PS. Structural variations within O-PS give rise to >170 recognized O antigens (2Hull S. Sussman M. Escherichia coli Lipopolysaccharide in Pathogenesis and Virulence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1997: 145-167Google Scholar). The core OS has limited variation with only five known core structures in E. coli (designated K-12, R1, R2, R3, and R4) but there are conserved structural themes in these core OSs (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar). The E. coli core OS is conceptually divided into two structural regions, the inner core region and the outer core region. The inner core consists of the sugars 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Hep). Phosphorylethanolamine residues can be attached nonstoichiometrically to KdoII, and the HepI and HepII residues are decorated with phosphoryl (P) and/or PPEtN residues (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylated inner core OS plays a crucial role in outer membrane stability (4Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Google Scholar, 5Yethon J.A. Vinogradov E. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5620-5623Google Scholar, 6Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5498-5504Google Scholar), and these essential functions may place structural constraints on the inner core OS, accounting for conservation of its base structure. Some additional type-specific modifications occur at KdoII or HepIII (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar, 7Holst O. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Ryan J. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 136-142Google Scholar, 8Frirdich E. Lindner B. Holst O. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1659-1671Google Scholar) and these include an α-1,7-linked GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) residue on HepIII in the E. coli R3 inner core (Fig. 1A). The outer core consists of a tri-hexose (HexI-HexII-HexIII) backbone where the sequence of glucose or galactose residues at the HexII and HexIII positions varies according to core type. The HexI residue represents the first sugar and is always Glc (Fig. 1A, GlcI). The trisaccharide backbone is modified with side branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues that vary according to core type. Variations in outer core structure give rise to altered sites for the attachment of O-PS in some core types, as well as altered antigenic epitopes and bacteriophage receptors (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar, 9Inagaki M. Kawaura T. Wakashima H. Kato M. Nishikawa S. Kashimura N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 226: 221-227Google Scholar). The five E. coli core types can be differentiated by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (10Appelmelk B.J. An Y.-Q. Hekker T.A.M. Thijs L.G. MacLaren D.M. de Graaf J. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1119-1124Google Scholar, 11Gibb A.P. Barclay G.R. Poxton I.R. Di Padova F. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1051-1057Google Scholar) and by PCR tests that are based on unique sequences in the waa gene clusters encoding enzymes involved in core OS biosynthesis (12Amor K. Heinrichs D.E. Frirdich E. Ziebell K. Johnson R.P. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Google Scholar). From such analyses it is evident that the R1 core type predominates in E. coli isolates most frequently associated with extraintestinal infections, whereas the R3 core type is detected in most enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) isolates, including O157:H7. The core OS is thought to be assembled by a coordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases that sequentially extend the core OS on a lipid A acceptor molecule, by transfer of glycosyl residues from nucleotide sugar precursors (1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Google Scholar). These reactions occur at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. The majority of the enzymes required for core OS assembly are encoded by genes within the chromosomal waa locus. The E. coli and Salmonella waa loci show conserved organizational features, and all consist of three operons (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar). The long central operon contains genes whose products are required for modification of the inner core OS (e.g. addition of phosphoryl residues and HepIII), as well as genes encoding the glycosyltransferases necessary for outer core OS biosynthesis. In the case of the R1 and R4 core OS types, this operon also contains the waaL gene whose product is required for ligation of O-PS to the lipid A core acceptor. The R3 core type is of biomedical interest because it is found in verotoxigenic isolates belonging to the common enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serogroups O157, O111, and O26 (12Amor K. Heinrichs D.E. Frirdich E. Ziebell K. Johnson R.P. Whitfield C. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 1116-1124Google Scholar, 13Currie C.G. Poxton I.R. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 24: 57-62Google Scholar) and in Shigella flexneri serotype 2a (14Jin Q. Yuan Z. Xu J. Wang Y. Shen Y. Lu W. Wang J. Liu H. Yang J. Yang F. Zhang X. Zhang J. Yang G. Wu H. Qu D. Dong J. Sun L. Xue Y. Zhao A. Gao Y. Zhu J. Kan B. Ding K. Chen S. Cheng H. Yao Z. He B. Chen R. Ma D. Qiang B. Wen Y. Hou Y. Yu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4432-4441Google Scholar), a strain most commonly associated with bacillary dysentery or shigellosis. The R3 core type is also found in E. coli J5, a mutant with rough LPS (i.e. devoid of O-PS) originally isolated from E. coli O111:B4 (15Appelmelk B.J. Maaskant J.J. Verweij-van Vught A.M. van der Meer N.M. Thijs B.G. MacLaren D.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2641-2647Google Scholar). The J5 LPS has been widely used in immunochemical studies, in analyses of endotoxicity, and in attempts to develop antibodies against core OS-lipid A that would be broadly cross-reactive and protective in applications such as treatment of sepsis (15Appelmelk B.J. Maaskant J.J. Verweij-van Vught A.M. van der Meer N.M. Thijs B.G. MacLaren D.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2641-2647Google Scholar, 16Appelmelk B. Gruteke P. Verweij-van Vught M. Maaskant J.

Immun. 1993; 61: 3863-3872Google Scholar). Antibodies cross-reacting with R3 core OS epitopes were detected in 6 of 10 patients infected with different EHEC strains (20Chart H. Cheasty T. Willshaw G.A. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 51: 1050-1054Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that IgG and IgA responses to the R3 core OS may be protective against E. coli and Shigella spp. (21Currie C.G. McCallum K. Poxton I.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 50: 345-354Google Scholar). The structure of the R3 core OS has been determined (Fig. 1A) (22Muller-Loennies S. Lindner B. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5982-5991Google Scholar), and the sequence of the waa loci have been reported for an R3 prototype (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar), for two isolates of E. coli O157 (23Perna N.T. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Mau B. Glasner J.D. Rose D.J. Mayhew G.F. Evans P.S. Gregor J. Kirkpatrick H.A.

The sequences of the waa genes from S. flexneri 2a and E. coli O157:H7 share >99% identity (14Jin Q. Yuan Z. Xu J. Wang Y. Shen Y. Lu W. Wang J. Liu H. Yang J. Yang F. Zhang X. Zhang J. Yang G. Wu H. Qu D. Dong J. Sun L. Xue Y. Zhao A. Gao Y. Zhu J. Kan B. Ding K. Chen S. Cheng H. Yao Z. He B. Chen R. Ma D. Qiang B. Wen Y. Hou Y. Yu J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4432-4441Google Scholar). The functions of some waa gene products have been deduced by high levels of sequence identity shared with known enzymes, but others could not have been assigned based on sequence data alone. Also, unlike the other E. coli core types, the R3 waa locus itself does not contain enough open reading frames to account for the observed core OS structure (3Heinrichs D.E. Yethon J.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 221-232Google Scholar). The objective of this work was to resolve ambiguities in the assignment of enzymatic activities to genes involved in the biosynthesis of the R3 core OS structure and establish the molecular architecture of the linkage region between core OS and O-PS in the LPS of E. coli serotype O157:H7. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The R3 prototype strain isolate in this study, F653, is an O antigen-deficient derivative of E. coli O111:K58 (26Schmidt G. Fromme I. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 14: 357-366Google Scholar) and contains a complete core OS. Also used in this study was a verotoxigenic-negative strain (EC960264) of E. coli O157:H7 obtained from Health Canada. Bacterial strains were all grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), gentamicin (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (30 μg/ml), tetracycline (10 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For growth and induction of strains containing pBAD24 derivatives, l-arabinose was used at a final concentration of 0.02%.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant propertiesSource or Ref.E. coliDH5αK-12 F- ϕ80d supE44 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U196 endA1 hsdR17(rK-12-mK-12) recA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA127Sambrook J.

PCR amplifications were carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermocycler or a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research), using conditions optimal for each primer pair. Chromosomal DNA template was prepared using the Bio-Rad Instagene matrix, and PwoI polymerase from Roche Diagnostics was used for PCR. PCR amplification products were separated by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels and stained using ethidium bromide. Purification of PCR and plasmid DNA fragments was carried out using Ultra-Clean DNA purification kit (MOBIO Laboratories). Qiagen plasmid spin kit or GenElute plasmid minipreps (Sigma) were used to purify recombinant plasmids. Large endogenous virulence plasmid DNA was prepared using the large plasmid QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). Ligation reactions were carried out using methods described elsewhere (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and restriction endonuclease enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Invitrogen and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad was used for electroporation of plasmids (28Binotto J. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson P.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1991; 37: 474-477Google Scholar), and the plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α. For Southern blots, restriction digests of ∼5 μg of plasmid DNA were separated on an agarose gel. The gel was treated with denaturing buffer, and the DNA was then transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics), by downward alkaline transfer for 3 h (29Meng A. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 72-73Google Scholar). The DNA was then cross-linked to the membrane using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). After low stringency prehybridization at 37 °C for 3 h, the membrane was probed with a digoxigenin-dUTP-labeled DNA probe at 37 °C overnight. The probe was made by PCR amplification of a 600-bp internal fragment of wabB gene and digoxigenin-labeled according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics). The blot was washed under low stringency conditions (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) three times at 25 °C, and the hybridized probe was detected colorimetrically by using an anti-digoxigenin antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The sequences of the waaQ operon from E. coli F653 (GenBank™ accession number AF019745) and O157:H7 (accession number AE005590) and the wabB gene from O157:H7 (deposited as “rfbU” accession number AAC70095) are available in GenBank™. Chromosomal Insertion Mutations—The waaJ and waaD genes of the R3 core OS biosynthesis region in E. coli F653 were independently mutated by insertion of a nonpolar gentamicin resistance cassette, aacC1, from plasmid pUCGm (30Schweizer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-833Google Scholar), giving strains CWG351 (waaD:: aacC1) and CWG350 (waaJ::aacC1). To construct the waaJ mutant, a PCR-amplified DNA fragment from F653 containing waaI-Y-J-D was cloned in pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) using the enzymes XhoI and SacII and sequenced to ensure error-free amplification. The primers used were 5′-AAGGAGATGACCGCGGAGCT-3′ (SacII, site underlined) and 5′-TGATGCTCGAGTTTATAC-3′ (XhoI). A 450-bp fragment of waaJ was removed by digesting the plasmid with EcoRV and PstI, and the ends were blunted using T4 polymerase (New England Biolabs). The SmaI-digested aacC1 gentamicin resistance cassette was ligated into the waaJ gene. The resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI and PstI to isolate a fragment containing the gentamicin resistance cassette flanked by waaJ sequences; this fragment was then cloned into the temperature-sensitive suicide vector, pMAK705 (31Hamilton C.A. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babtizke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Google Scholar), giving plasmid pWQ316. The waaD gene from F653 was PCR-amplified and cloned into pBAD24 using the primers 5′-GGTTAGAATTGAGATGGTTGATAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTTATCCATGGAAACGTA-3′, exploiting the EcoRI and NcoI sites (underlined) built into the primers. The resulting plasmid (pWQ157) was digested with NdeI, which cuts in the middle of the waaD gene, and the ends were filled in using the large Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). The plasmid was then ligated to the SmaI-digested aacC1 cassette. A fragment containing the aacC1 gene flanked by waaD sequences was removed as an EcoRI and XbaI fragment and ligated into pMAK705, as pWQ317. pMAK705 constructs were separately transformed into F653, and allelic exchange was performed as described elsewhere (4Yethon J.A. Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26310-26316Google Scholar). Each mutation was confirmed by PCR across the region, followed by sequencing of the mutation junction. To verify phenotypes and the nonpolar nature of each mutation, each derivative of F653 was complemented with a recombinant pBAD24 plasmid carrying the corresponding PCR-amplified individual open reading frame. Plasmid pWQ157 carrying waaD is described above. The waaJ gene was cloned into pBAD24 using the primers 5′-GATTAGAATTCAGGGTAATGAAATTG-3′ and 5′-TTTATCAACCATGTCGACTATTAACC-3′, exploiting the EcoRI and SalI sites (underlined) to give plasmid pWQ156. The wzy gene was also mutated in strain E. coli EC960264, to give CWG653 (wzy::aacC1). The wzy gene was amplified and cloned into the pBAD24 expression vector by using the primers 5′-GAGAAAGGAGAATTCAAAATGAAGTCAG-3′ and 5′-GTTTTTTCTAACTCTAGAGCATTATTATAAG-3′, and the resulting plasmid was used subsequently to complement the wzy mutation and verify that the phenotype represented a single genetic defect. A SmaI fragment carrying the aacC1gene was then inserted into the HpaI site in the middle of the wzy gene in pWQ60. An XbaI and SmaI fragment carrying the mutated wzy gene was then cloned into the sucrose-sensitive suicide plasmid, pRE-112 (32Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 149-157Google Scholar), giving pWQ318. The resulting plasmid was then transformed into E. coli SM10λpir and transferred by conjugation to a streptomycin-resistant mutant of E. coli O157:H7 (EC960264). A double crossover event was selected for by plating on 10% sucrose, streptomycin, and gentamicin. The same method was used to mutate the wabB mutation in CWG653 giving CWG654. Briefly, the wabB gene was amplified from E. coli O157:H7 using the primers 5′-GGGCCAAGGGTACCAGATAATTAATGA-3′ (KpnI site underlined) and 5′-GCTGTCTAGAGGATCCGCCGTTA-3′ (XbaI) and cloned into pBAD24, resulting in pWQ159. A SmaI fragment carrying the aacC1 gentamicin resistance cassette was cloned into the PvuII site the middle of the wabB gene. The mutated gene was digested with EcoRI, and the end was blunted using the Klenow fragment. After additional digestion with XbaI, this DNA fragment containing wabB::aacC1 was cloned into SmaI/XbaI-digested pRE112, and the resulting plasmid, pWQ319, was transformed into SM10λpir. The plasmid was transferred to CWG653 by conjugation, and a single crossover event was selected by plating on chloramphenicol and streptomycin. The isolate was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6, and a double crossover event was then selected for 10% sucrose and gentamicin. Both the wzy and the wzy/wabB mutants were verified by PCR and sequencing across the mutant junctions. Lipopolysaccharide Analysis by PAGE—Small scale LPS preparations were made from SDS-proteinase K whole-cell lysates by the method of Hitchcock and Brown (33Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Google Scholar). LPS was separated on either 10–20% gradient SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gels or 4–12% NuPAGE gels (obtained from NOVEX, San Diego, CA). SDS-PAGE and silver-staining conditions are reported elsewhere (34Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Google Scholar). In order to visualize the presence of d-galactan I O-PS in bacteria harboring pWQ3 (35Clarke B.R. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4614-4621Google Scholar), whole-cell lysates were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting using procedures described elsewhere (36Amor P.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 145-161Google Scholar) and polyclonal rabbit anti-d-galactan I serum (37Clarke B.R. Bronner D. Keenleyside W.J. Severn W.B. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5411-5418Google Scholar). Isolation of LPS and Purification of Oligosaccharides—Large scale LPS preparations were made using the phenol, chloroform, and petroleum ether method as outlined elsewhere (38Galanos C. Luderitz O.

Lipid A was removed as a precipitate by centrifugation, and soluble products were separated on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 95 cm) eluted in pyridinium/acetate buffer, pH 4.5 (4 ml of pyridine and 10 ml of AcOH in 1 liter of water). The eluate was monitored using a refractive index detector. For O-deacylation, 100 mg of LPS was dissolved in 3 ml of anhydrous hydrazine and incubated for 1 h at 40 °C. The mixture was then poured into cold acetone, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with acetone, and lyophilized. The LPS backbone oligosaccharides were isolated by O,N-deacylation of 120 mg of LPS in 4 ml of 4 m KOH at 120 °C for 16 h (39Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Google Scholar). The mixture was cooled and neutralized with 2 m HCl, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was desalted by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Individual compounds from the O,N-deacylated LPS were isolated by high performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a column (250 × 9 mm) of Carbopac PA1 that was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–80% 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 60 min. After desalting, oligosaccharides were isolated as single compounds in yields of 2–10 mg. LPS was dephosphorylated by dissolving 10 mg in 1 ml of 48% aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF), and the treatment was performed for 48 h at 4 °C (40Dasgupta T. de Kievit T.R. Masoud H. Altman E. Richards J.C. Sadovskaya I. Speert D.P. Lam J.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 809-817Google Scholar). The HF was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the LPS was resuspended in 10 ml of distilled water and lyophilized. After another round of dissolving in water and lyophilization, the final products were dissolved in 1 ml of water and used to provide acceptor LPS in the in vitro glycosyltransferase assays. Compositional and Methylation Analysis—For compositional analysis, LPS was hydrolyzed in 4 m CF3CO2H (110 °C, 3 h), and monosaccharides were converted into the alditol acetate derivatives. The products were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (GC) on an Agilent 6850 chromatograph equipped with DB-17 (30 m × 0.25 mm) fused silica column using a temperature gradient of 180 °C (2 min) → 240 °C at 2 °C/min. Methylation analysis was performed using Ciucanu-Kerek procedure (41Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Google Scholar). Methylated products were hydrolyzed, and the monosaccharides were converted to 1d-alditol acetates by conventional methods and analyzed by GC-MS.

https://openalex.org/W2049032587,"Like other nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes, neuronal NOS (nNOS) turnover and activity are regulated by the ubiquitous protein chaperone hsp90. We have shown previously that nNOS expressed in Sf9 cells where endogenous heme levels are low is activated from the apo- to the holo-enzyme by addition of exogenous heme to the culture medium, and this activation is inhibited by radicicol, a specific inhibitor of hsp90 (Billecke, S. S., Bender, A. T., Kanelakis, K. C., Murphy, P. J. M., Lowe, E. R., Kamada, Y., Pratt, W. B., and Osawa, Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 15465–15468). In this work, we examine heme binding by apo-nNOS to form the active enzyme in a cell-free system. We show that cytosol from Sf9 cells facilitates heme-dependent apo-nNOS activation by promoting functional heme insertion into the enzyme. Sf9 cytosol also converts the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to a state where the hydrophobic ligand binding cleft is open to access by steroid. Both cell-free heme activation of purified nNOS and activation of steroid binding activity of the immunopurified GR are inhibited by radicicol treatment of Sf9 cells prior to cytosol preparation, and addition of purified hsp90 to cytosol partially overcomes this inhibition. Although there is an hsp90-dependent machinery in Sf9 cytosol that facilitates heme binding by apo-nNOS, it is clearly different from the machinery that facilitates steroid binding by the GR. hsp90 regulation of apo-nNOS heme activation is very dynamic and requires higher concentrations of radicicol for its inhibition, whereas GR steroid binding is determined by assembly of stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes that are formed by a purified five-chaperone machinery that does not activate apo-nNOS.

Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The regulation is achieved through the ATP-dependent assembly of signaling protein·hsp90 heterocomplexes by the multi-protein hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The association of hsp90 with its “client proteins” is not determined by specific amino acid motifs or secondary modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, acetylation, etc.) in the client protein, and it has not been clear how hsp90 could associate with and regulate such a wide variety of proteins regardless of their structure or sequence. How the chaperone machinery recognizes and interacts with its signaling protein clients is a fundamental mechanistic problem. In cell-free assays, the two essential components of the machinery, hsp90 and hsp70, have been shown to function individually as chaperones that bind to exposed hydrophobic amino acids in denatured proteins and through rounds of binding and release to facilitate protein refolding (2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). However, studies with steroid receptors suggest that this is not the way hsp90 and hsp70 function when they act together as part of an integrated chaperone machinery. hsp90 binds to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of steroid receptors, and the ligand binding activity of some steroid receptors and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is absolutely hsp90-dependent (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Thus, when the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is stripped of its associated hsp90, it immediately loses its ability to bind steroid, and steroid binding activity is regenerated when GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes are reformed by the hsp90/hsp70-based multichaperone machinery (3Morishima Y.

Steroid ligands bind deep in a hydrophobic cleft that appears to be collapsed in the absence of ligand, such that the receptor must change its conformation to allow entry of the ligand (5Gee A.C. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The chaperone machinery carries out the ATP-dependent opening of the steroid binding cleft in the GR LBD such that it can be accessed by steroid, and it promotes conformational changes that increase the sensitivity of the GR LBD to attack by thiolderivatizing agents and trypsin (6Stancato L.F.

In contrast to the chaperoning action of hsp90 and hsp70 on denatured proteins, there is no evidence that the chaperone machinery acts on a GR that is in any way denatured or in a so-called “nearly native” state. Rather, the machinery acts on a GR where the hydrophobic steroid binding cleft appears to be collapsed such that the LBD is in a native, minimal energy conformation. The initial step in GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly is the ATP- and hsp40-dependent priming of the GR by hsp70 to form a GR·hsp70 complex that can then bind Hop and hsp90 and undergo a second ATP-dependent step in which the steroid binding cleft is opened (3Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H.

It is the ATP-dependent conformation of hsp70 that initially binds to the GR LBD, rather than the ADP-dependent conformation that favors interaction of hsp70 with hydrophobic peptides (10Kanelakis K.C. Shewach D.S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33698-33703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A short segment of the GR that lies at the extreme amino terminus of the LBD is required for LBD·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and steroid binding activity (11Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This segment lies at the rim of the ligand binding cleft of the receptor (12Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and mutational analysis reveals that hsp90 binding requires the presence of the segment but no defined amino acid composition (13Kaul S. Murphy P.J.M. Chen J. Brown L. Pratt W.B. Simons S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36223-36232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The work on the mechanism of GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly led to the notion that the chaperone machinery interacts with the region where the hydrophobic cleft merges with the surface of the receptor. Such regions are a general topologic feature of virtually all proteins in native conformation, and this cleft recognition hypothesis could account for the ability of the chaperone machinery to interact with a variety of proteins in native conformation regardless of sequence or structure (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The ability of the chaperone machinery to recognize hydrophobic clefts and to open and stabilize them in the open state, even transiently, could facilitate the entry of a number of hydrophobic ligands and prosthetic groups to catalytic centers in the interior of many enzymes. As a start to testing this general proposal, we have examined the role of hsp90 in facilitating the binding of heme by apo-neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (apo-nNOS). The NOS enzymes are important signaling proteins that function as cytochrome P450-type hemoproteins to catalyze the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline from l-arginine, O2, and NADPH (14Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1141: 217-230Crossref Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The NOS enzymes are active as homodimers, with each monomer binding tightly 1 eq each of FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin, and heme (14Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The heme-deficient monomer of NOS can be partially reconstituted in vitro in the presence of heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and arginine to form the functional homodimer (20Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S.

We have shown previously that a portion of neuronal NOS (nNOS) is bound to hsp90 in vivo and that treatment of mammalian cells with an hsp90 inhibitor to block nNOS·hsp90 assembly leads to nNOS degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (23Bender A.T.

We have also shown that treatment of nNOS-expressing Sf9 cells with the hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol inhibits activation of apo-nNOS activity by exogenous heme (23Bender A.T.

Sf9 cells have very low levels of endogenous heme, and addition of exogenous heme to the culture medium increases nNOS activity in transfected cells. Inhibition of hsp90 is accompanied by a marked inhibition in heme binding and by an inability to form the dimeric state of nNOS, implying a role for hsp90 in heme-mediated assembly of the holo-enzyme (24Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Lowe E.R. Kamada Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20504-20509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ferrous·carbonyl complex of nNOS is not formed when hsp90 is inhibited, indicating that functional heme insertion is prevented (24Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Lowe E.R.

To date, we have not been able to demonstrate a role for hsp90 in heme binding and nNOS activation in a cell-free system. Here, we show that cytosol prepared from Sf9 cells facilitates cell-free heme insertion into apo-nNOS and conversion to the active holo-nNOS enzyme. Cytosol from radicicoltreated Sf9 cells is not active in permitting heme activation of apo-nNOS or in converting the GR to the steroid binding state, and in both cases the inhibition is partially reversed by the addition of purified hsp90. However, the hsp90 machinery that dynamically facilitates heme access to its binding cleft in apo-nNOS is different from the hsp90 machinery that assembles stable hsp90 complexes with the GR to facilitate steroid binding access to its hydrophobic ligand binding cleft.

Sf9 cells were grown in SFM 900 II serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). To express holo-nNOS, oxyhemoglobin (25 μm) was added as a source of heme during the last 24 h of expression. Cultures (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0.

In the experiment of Fig. 4A, Sf9 cells (50 ml, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant nNOS baculovirus for 36 h and then treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or 20 μm radicicol for 20 min. A 5-ml aliquot was treated with 25 μm heme, added as an albumin conjugate (25Asseffa A. Smith S.J. Nagata K. Gillette J. Gelboin H.V. Gonzalez F.J. Arch. Biochem.

Cells were ruptured, and nNOS activity was measured as described below. The remainder of the cell suspension (45 ml) was washed twice with 25 ml of SFM 900 II medium, the cells were resuspended in 45 ml of medium, and the incubation was continued without heme.

Cell-free Activation of Apo-nNOS with Heme—Aliquots (25 μl) of cytosol from nNOS-expressing Sf9 cells that were grown in heme-free medium were preincubated at 27 °C with 3 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 250 mm creatine phosphate in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 30 μl.

Aliquots of 3.5 μl were removed at various times for assay of nNOS activity. In some experiments, purified apo-nNOS (10 μg) was substituted for cytosol from nNOS-expressing Sf9 cells in the reconstitution mixture. Where indicated, 20 μl of cytosol prepared from uninfected Sf9 cells pretreated with radicicol or vehicle was added to the reconstitution mixture containing purified apo-nNOS. DE52 Chromatography of Sf9 Cytosol—Non-infected Sf9 cytosol (12 ml) was adsorbed to a 1.5 × 20-cm column of DE52 equilibrated with HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4); the column was washed with 100 ml of HE buffer, producing a “drop-through” fraction, followed by elution of bound proteins with 100 ml of HEK buffer (HE buffer containing 500 mm KCl) to produce a “retained” fraction. Each fraction was concentrated to 2 ml, and then a portion (6 μl) was used in place of cytosol for heme-mediated reconstitution of purified apo-nNOS. For the preparation of DE52-retained fractions A, B, and C, 30 ml of Sf9 cytosol was adsorbed to a 2.5 × 18-cm column of DE52 equilibrated with HE buffer; the column was washed with 250 ml of HE buffer, and proteins were eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 0–0.5 m KCl. hsp90 and hsp70 were assayed by Western blotting an aliquot of every other fraction using rabbit antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of hsp90 that also detects hsp70. Fractions were combined in three pools designated A–C as described by Dittmar et al. (27Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Assay of nNOS Activity—NO formation was assayed by the NO-mediated conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. nNOS-containing samples were added to an assay solution containing 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μml-arginine, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 units/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 25 μm oxyhemoglobin, and an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of 400 μm NADP+, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, expressed as final concentrations, in a total volume of 180 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the rate of oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored with a microtiter plate reader as described previously (28Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J.

P450 Assay—The heme present in nNOS was assessed by measuring the ferrous·CO complex. Because the cell cytosols contained compounds that absorbed in the 420-nm region, we partially purified nNOS from the cytosols. Cytosols (8-mg total) were loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (2.0 cm × 0.8 cm) and eluted with 2′-AMP as described above, except that the gel filtration step was omitted. The ferrous carbonyl complex was measured as a difference spectrum and quantified with an extinction coefficient of 91 mm–1, as previously described (29McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Expression of Glucocorticoid Receptor in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cultures infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus containing the mouse GR cDNA at a multiplicity of infection of 3.0 were supplemented with 0.1% glucose at infection and 24 h post-infection as described by Srinivasan et al. (30Srinivasan G. Post J.F. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 4, at 48 h post-infection, cells were treated with Me2SO or 20 μm radicicol (or geldanamycin) for 20 min followed by washing and resuspension as described for nNOS-infected cells. At various times after washing, cells were harvested, resuspended in 1.5 volume of HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm molybdate) with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture per 3 ml of buffer (Roche Applied Science), and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected, aliquoted, flash-frozen, and stored at –70 °C. Immunoadsorption of GR—Receptors were immunoadsorbed from 50-μl aliquots of Sf9 cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 18 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 9 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Prior to incubation with Sf9 lysate, or the DE52-retained fractions of Sf9 lysate, or the purified proteins of the chaperone machinery, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μlof0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). GR·hsp90 Heterocomplex Reconstitution—FiGR immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with unfractionated rabbit reticulocyte lysate or with the five-protein assembly system (20 μg of purified hsp90, 15 μg of purified hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified p23, 0.125 μg of purified YDJ-1 (see Ref. 31Kanelakis K.C. Pratt W.B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar for details)) adjusted to 55 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for receptor-associated proteins. Assay of Steroid Binding Capacity—Immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding were incubated overnight at 4 °Cin50 μl of HEM buffer plus 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 50 μl of cell cytosol. For supernatants to be assayed for steroid binding, a 50-μl aliquot of supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °Cin50 μl HEM buffer with 100 nm [3H]dexamethasone in the absence or presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone. Samples were mixed with dextrancoated charcoal and, after centrifugation, counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/50 μl of cell cytosol. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Samples (immune pellets, aliquots of cytosol, and aliquots of DE52 fractions) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR for GR or 0.01% rabbit antiserum to the carboxyl terminus of hsp90 for insect hsp90 (this antibody also weakly detects insect hsp70), or 1 μg/ml AC88 for rabbit hsp90. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated counterantibody to visualize immunoreactive bands. Immunoblots for nNOS were run on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with 0.1% anti-nNOS polyclonal antibody as described (24Billecke S.S. Bender A.T. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Lowe E.R. Kamada Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20504-20509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In studies where the SDS-resistant dimer was measured, the reaction mixture was quenched with sample buffer supplemented with 100 μm BH4 and 100 μml-arginine. The samples were kept on ice prior to loading for analysis by SDS-PAGE as described above. This method has previously been described by Klatt et al. (32Klatt P. Schmidt K. Lehner D. Glatter O. Bachinger H.P. Mayer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) to prevent the dissociation of nNOS dimers prior to and during electrophoresis. Radicicol Treatment of Sf9 Cells Inhibits Subsequent Cell-free nNOS Activation—The major cell-free system used to study hsp90 action on signaling proteins is rabbit reticulocyte lysate (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar), but reticulocyte lysate contains very high levels of heme in addition to the necessary machinery for hsp90 heterocomplex assembly. Thus, although we have been able to activate apo-nNOS with reticulocyte lysate, we have not been able to show that the activation is both heme-dependent and hsp90-dependent (23Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because Sf9 cells grown in heme-free medium have low levels of endogenous heme, we asked whether concentrated lysate from cells grown in the absence of exogenous heme would support heme-dependent activation of apo-nNOS in vitro. In the experiment of Fig. 1,"
https://openalex.org/W2137672496,"The process by which agriculture diffused from the Fertile Crescent within the past 10,000 years has been widely discussed, but as yet there is no consensus: Was it mostly a demic diffusion (with massive spread of people) or rather a cultural diffusion (without substantial migration of people)? The demic diffusion model ([ 1 ][1]) predicts a substantial genetic input from migrating agriculturalists, whereas the cultural diffusion model ([ 2 ][2]) predicts no major changes at the genetic level. Hence, a way to test these competing hypotheses would be to compare genetic variation in traditional agriculturalists, traditional hunter-gatherers, and recent agriculturalists (i.e., former hunter-gatherers who recently shifted to agriculture). Under the demic diffusion model, recent agriculturalists are expected to show closer genetic affinities to traditional agriculturalists than do hunter-gatherers; whereas under the cultural diffusion model, recent agriculturalists should resemble hunter-gatherers genetically.

Genetic studies of Europeans have led to conflicting conclusions, partly because the genetic composition of pre-agricultural European populations is unknown. However, there still exist in India both nonagricultural groups and groups that recently adopted agriculture ([ 3 ][3], [ 4 ][4]), allowing a formal test of the demic versus cultural diffusion models of the spread of agriculture. Caste groups can be considered as traditional agriculturalists in this context, because they introduced key innovations (such as iron technology) that facilitated the expansion of agriculture toward south India ([ 4 ][4]). There are also tribal groups in south India who are generally considered to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the region and who have traditionally been hunter-gatherers ([ 3 ][3], [ 4 ][4]). Some of them still survive through hunting and gathering or unskilled labor, whereas others have shifted to an agriculturalist subsistence strategy within the past 3000 years ([ 4 ][4]).

Genetic affinities were deduced from the frequencies of 14 Y-chromosome haplogroups analyzed in 583 males, including 71 tribal south Indian hunter-gatherers, 60 tribal south Indian recent agriculturalists, and 283 south Indian and 169 north Indian traditional agriculturalists ([ 5 ][5]). Pairwise genetic (Fst) distances separating the different categories of individuals indicate that south Indian recent agriculturalists are significantly more closely related to traditional agriculturalists than are traditional hunter-gatherers ([Fig. 1A][6]) ( t test on jackknifed Fst values, P < 0.01). This conclusion is supported by a multidimensional scaling analysis that simultaneously compared all four categories; it also reveals that recent south Indian agriculturalists are overall genetically more similar to traditional agriculturalists than to traditional hunter-gatherers ([Fig. 1B][6]).

![ Fig. 1. ][7] Fig. 1. 
Genetic affinities between southern traditional hunter-gatherers (Trad. HG south), southern recent agriculturalists (Recent AG south), southern traditional agriculturalists (Trad. AG south), and northern traditional agriculturalists (Trad. AG north). ( A ) Fst distances were deduced from Y chromosome (below diagonal) and mtDNA (above diagonal) data. ( B and C ) Multidimensional scaling plots were based on (B) Y chromosome and (C) mtDNA Fst distances. SV, stress value.



Genetic affinities were also deduced from sequences of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region analyzed in 632 individuals, including 229 tribal south Indian hunter-gatherers, 201 tribal south Indian recent agriculturalists, and 140 south Indian and 62 north Indian traditional agriculturalists ([ 5 ][5]). Pairwise Fst distances separating the different categories of individuals indicate that south Indian recent agriculturalists are significantly more closely related to traditional agriculturalists than are traditional hunter-gatherers ([Fig. 1A][6]) ( t test on jackknifed Fst values, P < 0.001). This conclusion is also supported by a multidimensional scaling analysis ([Fig. 1C][6]); the latter also shows that recent south Indian agriculturalists are overall genetically more similar to traditional agriculturalists than to traditional hunter-gatherers. Thus, mtDNA variation shows trends that markedly parallel those deduced from Y-chromosome variation. This is also reflected in the fact that mtDNA and Y-chromosome genetic distances among traditional and recent agriculturalists and traditional hunter-gatherers are highly and significantly correlated (Mantel test, r2 = 0.805, P < 0.05).

The patterns of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in south India indicate that groups that have changed recently from a hunting-gathering subsistence strategy to agriculture have concomitantly received genes from traditional agriculturalists. This demonstrates the validity of the demic diffusion model for the spread of agriculture to India. It also underscores the importance of cultural processes such as the diffusion of agriculture in shaping human genetic variation.

The segments code for seven capsid and viral core proteins (VP1–VP7). The remaining three segments encode non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2, and NS3/NS3A) that are produced in the host cell at different stages of the infectious cycle and are presumed to be involved in the various steps of virus morphogenesis.Bluetongue virus RNA segment 8 encodes non-structural protein 2 (molecular mass ∼41 kDa), which is phosphorylated (1Devaney M.A. Kendall J. Grubman M.J. Virus Res. 1988; 11: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and able to self-associate to form multimeric assemblies in complex with single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (2Taraporewala Z.F. Chen D. Patton J.T. Virology. 2001; 280: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The protein is synthesized in large amounts throughout the replication cycle of Bluetongue virus and is associated with large dense perinuclear structures called viral inclusion bodies in BTV-infected mammalian cells (3Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Eaton B.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 4Eaton B.T. Hyatt A.D. Brookes S.M. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 162: 89-118PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that BTV assembly occurs at the perimeter of these viral inclusion bodies (3Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Eaton B.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In insect cells, recombinant baculovirus-expressed NS2 has been shown to accumulate as multimers forming inclusion bodies, not unlike those observed in BTV-infected mammalian cells, even when synthesized independently of any other BTV-encoded proteins or viral RNA (5Thomas C.P. Booth T.F. Roy P. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Deletions at the C terminus of up to 130 amino acids do not affect the protein oligomerization (6Zhao Y. Thomas C. Bremer C. Roy P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the other BTV proteins, NS2 appears unique by virtue of its ability to bind ssRNA (but not dsRNA). The protein is of particular interest because of its possible involvement in genome recognition (preference for viral ssRNA versus cellular ssRNA), which generally is known to be an early crucial step in the assembly process of the viruses. Two deletion mutagenesis studies (6Zhao Y. Thomas C. Bremer C. Roy P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fillmore G.C. Lin H. Li J.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have indicated that the N-terminal half of the protein, which bears most of the homology within the NS2 family, is an RNA binding domain. Although the isolated N-terminal half of the protein can be functional, other RNA binding sites are required for the high affinity RNA binding (7Fillmore G.C. Lin H. Li J.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An analysis of the primary structure of NS2 does not reveal any sequence similarity to well known RNA binding motifs such as the ribonucleotide motif (8Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the K homology (KH) domain originally described in the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K protein (8Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the arginine-rich motif (9Puglisi J.D. Tan R. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Williamson J.R. Science. 1992; 257: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), or the RGG and RS motifs (10Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar).NS2 shares a number of features with other non-structural proteins; for example, NSP2 of rotavirus (11Taraporewala Z. Chen D. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9934-9943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and σNS of reovirus (12Gillian A.L. Schmechel S.C. Livny J. Schiff L.A. Nibert M.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5939-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the functions of which have been implicated in genome packaging. It has been shown that cells infected with temperature-sensitive mutants of NSP2 contain few replication assembly factories (viroplasms) and produce virus particles that are mostly empty (13Taraporewala Z.F. Schuck P. Ramig R.F. Silvestri L. Patton J.T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7082-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).To obtain insight into how NS2 and ssRNA interact and function, we have determined the crystal structure of the RNA binding domain of NS2 and examined it for potential binding surfaces as well as defined flexible protein regions that might become ordered upon RNA binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression Studies of the N-terminal Domain Using Recombinant Baculovirus-infected Insect Cells and Escherichia coli—The S8 gene from BTV serotype 10 (encoding full-length NS2) contained in the recombinant plasmid pAcBTV-10.8 (5Thomas C.P. Booth T.F. Roy P. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was used to generate the NS21–177 construct. DNA coding for residues 1–177 was produced by PCR amplification on the NS21–354 sequence with the primers A (5′-CGCGGATCCCATATGGAGCAAAAGCAACGTAG-3′) and B (5′-TGCGCTCGAGCGGCCGCTTACGGCCGCGCCACGCTATGAACTTGAAG-3′) inserting BamHI and EagI sites before cloning the PCR product into a modified pVL1393 plasmid (Invitrogen) with a C-terminal His6 tag. The plasmid for the untagged NS21–177 protein was produced using the BamHI and NotI sites.To produce C-terminal glutathione S-transferase-tagged protein, the primers C (5′-ATATACGGCCGGGATCTGAAAACCTGTACTTCCAGGGCCATGGACATATGCATCACCATCACCAC-3′) and the reverse strand D (5′-CCGCTCGAGAGATCTTTATCCATGGGATCCGCCCTGAAAATAAAGATTCTC-3′) were used with a modified pVL1393 plasmid (Invitrogen) with a His6 glutathione S-transferase tag and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) site (plasmid and sequence available upon request) as a PCR template. The product was cut with EagI and ligated with the C-terminal His6-tagged pVL1393NS21–177 vector also cut with EagI. The constructs were checked by sequencing.The NS21–177 constructs were expressed at 28 °C in High 5 insect cells (Invitrogen) by means of infection with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. The recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of the desired protein were produced in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 cells. 65 h postinfection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the protein samples were prepared to test for the solubility of NS21–177. The expressed protein was found mainly in the pellet at 30 μg/5 × 107 cells.The coding region for the 177-residue domain was excised from the pVL1393 vector using the BamHI and XhoI sites and ligated into the same sites of the N-terminal His6-tagged pBAT4 cloning vector (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany). The same 177-residue coding region was excised using the restriction enzymes NdeI and EagI to produce the appropriate restriction sites and was inserted into the C-terminal His6-tagged pET-21a vector (Novagen). The expression vectors were transformed into the BL21(DE3)pLys strain of E. coli. The expression levels of the NS21–177 construct were low (less than 1 mg/liter of culture), and the protein was found only in the pellet after the first centrifugation step, indicating that it was insoluble. Lowering the temperature during expression, using other salts during extraction, or adding up to 10% glycerol did not improve the solubility.Expression and Purification of the TEV Insert Construct—The full-length NS2 from Bluetongue virus serotype 10 was engineered with a TEV protease cleavage site between residues 182 and 183. The insert resulted in the sequence NS21–182-Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly-NS2183–354 with the TEV cleavage occurring between Gln and Gly. The PCR amplification was performed in two steps. In the first step, fragments were generated using primers A and E (5′-GCCCTGAAAATAAAGATTCTCCGACTCCTCCCTTGGCGC-3′) for the first fragment and F (5′-GAGAATCTTTATTTTCAGGGCCGCTGGATGGATGATGATGAG-3′) and G (5′-TGCGCTCGAGCGGCCGCTTACGGCCGAACGCCGACCGGCAATATG-3′) for the second fragment. The second PCR step used the two generated fragments together with primers A and G. The PCR product was ligated into expression vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen) at the NdeI and EagI sites. The plasmid for untagged NS21–354 protein was produced using the NdeI and XhoI sites. The resulting C-terminal His6-tagged plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen), and 1-liter expression cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin at a concentration of 50 μg/ml and chloramphenicol at 34 μg/ml. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6, and expression was induced at 25 °C with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 5–6 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 m sodium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After the sonication step, the supernatant was clarified by ultracentrifugation (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 20,000 rpm, 4 °C, 1 h), filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane, and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium chloride in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. The protein eluted at a concentration of ∼400 mm sodium chloride. Purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The protein fractions at the absorption peak were pooled and diluted by a factor of two prior to loading onto a HiTrap Heparin column (5 ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with 200 mm sodium chloride in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0. After a 4-column volume wash, a two step elution of 300 mm and of 600 mm sodium chloride was developed. The C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein eluted at a concentration of 600 mm sodium chloride. To decrease the salt concentration, the eluted protein solution was dialysed against the storage buffer consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 500 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was expressed in a methionine-auxotroph cell host, the E. coli B834(DE3)pLys strain (Novagen), and purified in the same manner as the native protein. To avoid oxidation of selenomethionine, all buffers were flushed with nitrogen and supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol.Crystallization and Data Collection—Diffraction-quality crystals of the N-terminal domain of NS2 protein were obtained at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The crystallization drops consisted of 1 μl of mixed protein solution (8–15 mg/ml) with TEV protease (50 μg/ml) and 1 μl of reservoir solution. Each drop was equilibrated against 1 ml of the reservoir solution, and conditions of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.35–0.65 m sodium chloride at pH 7.5 and 10–25% (v/v) Jeffamine M-600 gave the best results. Selenomethionine derivative crystals could be grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C from 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, sodium chloride between 0.4 m and 1.2 m, 20–25% Jeffamine M-600 (v/v), plus 10 mm dithiothreitol. Needle-like crystals with dimensions of 0.7 × 0.01 × 0.01 mm3 were observed for the native protein. The crystals belonging to space group P65 diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution with cell dimensions of a = b = 102.29 Å and c = 77.91 Å, and the value of the Matthews coefficient (14Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar) suggests that there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit (VM = 2.8 A3/Da with a solvent content of 54%). The morphology and the size of selenomethionine derivative crystals were similar to those of the native crystals, and they diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.9 Å. The native data set was collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory beamline X13 (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany), and selenomethionine derivative data sets were collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory beamlines BW7A and X11 as well as at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline BM14 (Grenoble, France). A selenomethionine-containing crystal soaked with ssRNA, as described under “ssRNA Soaking Experiments,” was used for data collection on the European Molecular Biology Laboratory X11 beamline. Data were reduced, merged, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALE-PACK, respectively (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab ssRNA Soaking Experiments—A synthetic oligonucleotide having the rotavirus 5′ consensus sequence 5′-GGCUUUAAAAG-3′ was cleaved from a solid support, and all of the protecting groups were removed according to the supplier's protocol (CRUACHEM, UK). The concentration of the RNA solution was 42 μm. Previous binding experiments showed that a suitable RNA binding buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 40 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. 2C. Butan, H. van der Zandt, and P. A. Tucker, unpublished results. Crystals of selenomethionine-containing protein were grown from 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7–8, 0.7–0.9 m potassium chloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20–25% (v/v) Jeffamine M-600, and soaking experiments were performed by adding between 2 and 4 μl of ssRNA solution to the crystal-containing drops.Structure Determination and Refinement—The crystal structure of the RNA binding domain of NS2 (Fig. 1) was solved by the SIRAS method using the 4.0 Å data set collected at the selenium absorption edge (0.973 Å). Fourteen of sixteen possible selenium sites were located. Eleven sites were identified using the program SnB (16Weeks C.M. Miller R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and three other selenium positions were found after analyzing the residual maps produced by SHARP (17de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Positions and occupancies were initially refined with the program MLPHARE (18Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and further in the program SHARP, which was also used to generate SIRAS phases. The final SIRAS phases had a figure of merit of 0.51 for the entire resolution range (18–4.0 Å). Density modification procedures, including solvent flattening and two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging of the experimental map were used to extend the phases to 2.4 Å in the program RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). The non-crystallographic symmetry operator was determined with RESOLVE from the identified selenium atom positions.To obtain experimental phases to a higher resolution than 4.0 Å (thus improving the initial basis of the phase extension procedure and consequently obtaining a superior map) a three-wavelength anomalous dispersion data set was collected to a 2.9 Å resolution, and phases were determined using SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The initial phases had a figure of merit of 0.65 in the resolution range from 20.0 to 3.0 Å. Further phase improvement and extension to 2.4 Å using solvent flattening and two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging were carried out in the program RESOLVE. Two molecules in the asymmetric unit were built in the electron density map obtained from the three-wavelength anomalous dispersion data using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). Restrained refinement of coordinates and temperature factors was carried out using the program REFMAC5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar). Bulk solvent correction, different types of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints between parts of the two monomers, as well as translation, libration, and screw-rotation refinement were used during the refinement calculations with REFMAC5. Waters were added to the model in an automated manner using the protocol implemented in the ARP/wARP software (23Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar) and manually verified in O. The quality of the model was checked using the program PRO-CHECK (24Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The figures were generated using the programs MolScript (25Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), ALSCRIPT (26Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), and PyMOL (pymol.sf.net).RESULTSDomain Identification—The full-length protein has been initially expressed using recombinant baculovirus according to the procedures described by Thomas et al. (5Thomas C.P. Booth T.F. Roy P. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the presence of protease inhibitors, crystallization trials failed either because the domain structure of the protein introduced conformational heterogeneity or more probably because the protein was heterogeneously aggregated. When protease inhibitors were not used, needle-like or chunky crystals were obtained and diffracted to a 3.7 Å maximum resolution. Data (not shown) were collected to low resolution and analyzed, and they revealed a hexagonal space group with unit cell dimensions a = b = 104 Å and c = 81.7 Å. SDS-PAGE showed that different crystals contained varying amounts of full-length protein and proteolytic products, but that despite this, the diffraction pattern was the same. This suggested that only the major proteolytic product was ordered in the crystals. We also observed that proteolysis could be accelerated by adding trypsin. Mass spectroscopy analysis of the crystals indicated that the first 177 residues formed the major proteolytic product, which was also necessary and sufficient for RNA binding. Constructs of residues 1–177 were expressed with His6 or glutathione S-transferase tags at the C terminus using recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells or expressed in E. coli with a His6 tag at the N and C termini for the purpose of crystallization. Although expression of the 178–354-residue domain resulted in soluble material,2 we could not obtain soluble protein for the 1–177-residue domain. NS2 is a phosphoprotein, and we have shown by ion exchange chromatography the presence of two species, possibly in different phosphorylation states when expressed using recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells.Separation and crystallization of the individual species did not improve the crystal quality.As it was not possible to obtain soluble protein for the 1–177-residue construct, we decided that crystallization under proteolytic conditions would be the method of choice. Crystals of the N-terminal domain (NS2N) diffracting to higher resolution were obtained after engineering a TEV protease cleavage site between residues 182 and 183 of the full-length protein (Fig. 2A). Because the polypeptide region beyond residue 177 was predicted to be unstructured, we decided to use the next five residues of the sequence as a linker to the engineered TEV cleavage site. The insertion of this cleavage site resulted in a better control of the proteolytic cleavage process during crystallization, perhaps because TEV is a highly specific and only moderately active protease. The construct was expressed in E. coli to avoid previously identified heterogeneities due to variable phosphorylation. It was shown that TEV protease cleaves this construct and that small crystals could be obtained when this was done.Fig. 2Sequence alignment of the BTV10 NS2N domain with those in other orbiviruses.A, domain organization of the construct used for protein expression. B, alignment of representative sequences of NS2 N-terminal regions from different BTV serotypes and two other orbiviruses. Completely conserved residues are shown within a box, identical residues in BTV strains are colored light gray, and similar residues are dark gray. The first three sequences correspond to proteins from different Bluetongue virus serotypes, and the last two correspond to other orbiviruses namely, Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease virus 2 (EHDV2) and African Horsesickness virus 9 (AHSV9). The secondary structure elements shown above the alignment are obtained from the x-ray structure. Residues that are likely to be involved in RNA binding are highlighted with an asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Overall Structure—The structure of NS2N was determined by anomalous scattering methods using crystals of selenomethionine-containing protein. The model presented here was refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å with an R-factor of 21.1% and a free R value of 26.7%. The domain crystallized with a dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The refined model contained residues 8–160 of both molecules and 103 water molecules. Residues 161–182, the six additional residues of the TEV cleavage site insertion, and residues 1–7 at the N terminus were not seen in the electron density map and were presumed to be disordered in the crystal. The refinement statistics as well as an evaluation of the quality of the current model are shown in Table I.Each monomer exhibits a mixed β sandwich structure (Fig. 1A). One layer consists of β1, β2, β3, β4, β8, and β9. A short helical region (310 and α1) connects β1 with β2. Almost matching the length of one dimension of the monomer, the β8 strand intertwines with the β9 strand, and both are twisted. β8 forms a small antiparallel β sheet with β10 from the C terminus. The other layer consists of β5, β6, and β7. The β4 strand links the two β sheets forming a highly stable structural core (Fig. 1A). The C terminus of the construct (Met134-Arg160) extends out ∼22 Å from the body of the monomer making contacts with an adjacent subunit in the crystal. In this respect, NS2N is similar to another RNA-binding protein, the ribosomal protein S15 from Bacillus stearothermophilus (28Clemons Jr., W.M. Davies C. White S.W. Ramakrishnan V. Structure. 1998; 6: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which consists of a core and an N-terminal segment that protrudes 36 Å from the core of the protein and interacts with a neighboring monomer. No other proteins were found to exhibit a similar topology (Fig. 1B) when searching for structural similarity in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar).Structure of the Dimers and Dimer Interfaces—The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic two-fold axis and are superimposable with a root mean square deviation of 0.41 Å over all Cα atoms of residues 8–160. There are two possible descriptions for the homodimeric configuration: monomers interact 1) through their C termini giving rise to an interface, which buries almost 20% of the total monomer surface (1831 Å2) (Fig. 3A), and 2) through a continuation of β sheet structure (Fig. 3B), which results in a buried surface area of 1075 Å2 per monomer.Fig. 3Ribbon representation of the NS2N homodimeric configurations and overview of the crystal packing.A, the largest interface between monomers buries 1831 Å2 of the surface area of each monomer.

Here we investigated molecular interactions of three classes of nonpeptide antagonists with human, rat, and macaque GnRH receptors. Although all are high affinity ligands of the human receptor (Ki <5 nm), these compounds show reduced affinity for the macaque receptor and bind only weakly (Ki >1 μm) to the rat receptor. To identify residues responsible for this selectivity, a series of chimeric receptors and mutant receptors was constructed and evaluated for nonpeptide binding. Surprisingly, 4 key residues located in the amino terminus (Met-24) and extracellular loops II (Ser-203, Gln-208) and III (Leu-300) of the GnRH receptor appear to be primarily responsible for species-selective binding. Comparisons of reciprocal mutations suggest that these may not be direct contacts but rather may be involved in organizing extracellular portions of the receptor. These data are novel because most previous reports of residues involved in binding of nonpeptide ligands to peptide-activated G protein-coupled receptors, including the GnRH receptor as well as mono-amine receptors, have identified binding sites in the transmembrane regions.

The GnRH receptor (Gn-RHR) is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Its activation stimulates phospholipase C and phosphatidyl inositol turnover by coupling to the GTP-binding proteins Gq and G11 (4Hsieh K.P. Martin T.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1673-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of pituitary GnRH receptors by hypothalamic GnRH released into the pituitary portal circulation results in secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone into the peripheral circulation. The gonadotropins in turn regulate the production of steroids and gametes by the gonads. Receptors for GnRH have been cloned from a wide range of species (5Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and numerous studies have been reported elucidating key residues in the receptor responsible for peptide binding and signal transduction (5Sealfon S.C. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 180-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Peptide drugs that inhibit the action of GnRH have proven useful in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and are now routinely used for ablation of gonadal steroids. This approach has proven effective in the management of endometriosis, prostate cancer, uterine fibroids, breast cancer, and other conditions, including infertility (6Lunenfeld B. Lunenfeld B. GnRH Analogues: The State of the Art at the Millennium. The Parthenon Publishing Group, New York1999Google Scholar). However, the requirement for daily injection or implantation of long acting depots has prompted a number of groups to attempt to develop orally active, nonpeptide antagonists (for a review, see Ref. 7Millar R.P. Zhu Y.F. Chen C. Struthers R.S. Br. Med. Bull. 2000; 56: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These efforts have been hindered in part by the species selectivity that is observed for most nonpeptide GnRH antagonists. Cho et al. (8Cho N. Harada M. Imaeda T. Imada T. Matsumoto H. Hayase Y. Sasaki S. Furuya S. Suzuki N. Okubo S. Ogi K. Endo S. Onda H. Fujino M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4190-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported synthesis of T-98475, a nonpeptide GnRH antagonist with high affinity to the human GnRH receptor. However, this compound was 20-fold less potent against the receptor from the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and 300-fold less potent against the rat receptor. Similarly, an unrelated nonpeptide GnRH antagonist (9Cui J. Smith R.G. Mount G.R. Lo J.L. Yu J. Walsh T.F. Singh S.B. DeVita R.J. Goulet M.T. Schaeffer J.M. Cheng K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was found to be highly potent against the human but 50- to 300-fold less potent at the dog receptor. We have reported several nonpeptide antagonist series with remarkable selectivity for the human receptor compared with the rat receptor (10Wilcoxen K.M. Zhu Y.F. Connors P.J. Saunders J. Gross T.D.

These observations are somewhat surprising given that, with one or two exceptions (14Limonta P. Bardin C.W. Ladishenskaya A. Pavlou S. Sundaram K. Thau R.B. Contraception. 1985; 32: 75-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 15Thau R.B. Limonta P. Schmidt F. Sundaram K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1985; 23: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), similar degrees of species selectivity have not been reported for the thousands of peptide GnRH analogs that have been synthesized by numerous groups (16Karten M.J. Rivier J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 44-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The rat GnRH receptor is highly homologous (87%) to the human receptor, whereas the receptor cloned from the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) contains only 8 substitutions of the 328 amino acids in the human sequence. Therefore, to identify the molecular basis of this species selectivity and identify residues involved in nonpeptide ligand binding to the GnRH receptor, we have investigated residues responsible for the selectivity of several nonpeptide GnRH antagonists for the human receptor over receptors from rat and macaque. Systematic mutagenesis of extracellular and transmembrane residues was used to identify critical nonpeptide contacts responsible for human/macaque selectivity. Chimeric rat/human receptors were employed to localize regions responsible for selectivity, and individual residues were then identified by systematic mutagenesis. Here we report that species selectivity for three families of nonpeptide GnRH antagonists is determined by residues in the amino terminus and extracellular loops II and III. Materials—Rhesus pituitary tissue was a generous gift from Sierra Biomedical. [d-Leu6,NMeLeu7,Pro9-NEt]GnRH was synthesized by solid phase methods.

Preparation of GnRH Radioligand—The GnRH analog [d-Leu6,NMeLeu7,Pro9-NEt]GnRH was labeled by the chloramine-T method. 1 mCi of Na125I was added to 10 μg of peptide in 20 μl of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, followed by 22.5 μg of chloramine-T in 15 μl of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer. The mixture was vortexed for 20 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 60 μg of sodium metabisulfite in 30 μl of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer. The free iodine was removed by passing the reaction mixture through a C-8 Sep-Pak cartridge (Millipore Corp., Milford, MA). The peptide was eluted with a small volume of 80% acetonitrile/water. The recovered labeled peptide was further purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a Vydac C-18 analytical column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) on a Beckman 334 gradient HPLC system using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purified radioactive peptide was stored in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/20% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at –80 °C and can be used for up to 4 weeks. Cloning Rhesus Macaque Receptor—Total RNA was isolated from rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) pituitary tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and first strand cDNA made with the cDNA synthesis kit from Invitrogen. The full coding sequence of the GnRHR was amplified with PCR primers corresponding to the human GnRHR cDNA sequence. The 5′-primer (5′-catgatctcgagaagctctgtcctgggaaaatatg-3′) contained a XhoI restriction site followed by 17 bases of human 5′-untranslated sequence ending with the start codon. The 3′-primer (5′-gacgaattcatatgacttcttgtgtagtctatcaa-3′) corresponded to 29 bp of human 3′-untranslated sequence immediately following the stop codon of the human receptor, followed by an EcoRI I restriction site. A band of ∼1kb was amplified, isolated, and cloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen). Six independent clones were isolated and sequenced on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Construction of Chimeric and Point Mutant Receptors—cDNAs of human, monkey, and rat GnRH receptors were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+). The Tth111I unique recognition site was identified at the amino terminus/TMI junction of the human GnRH receptor. ScaI, BsGI, and StuI sites were introduced through silent mutations, as described previously, into the human and rat GnRH receptors (19Ott T.R. Troskie B.E. Roeske R.W. Illing N. Flanagan C.A. Millar R.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Through a series of restriction digests and or PCR amplifications using primers flanked with the appropriate restriction enzyme recognition sequences, DNA portions of both receptors were generated and gel-purified. Upon digestion of the PCR-amplified products, the receptor DNA fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase to assemble the rat/human chimeras. Point mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutants are named as species receptor background, wild-type residue, residue number, and mutant residue using single letter abbreviations for the amino acids. The entire coding regions of all point mutants and chimeras were verified by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Transfection—24-well tissue culture plates were seeded with the CHO-K1 cell line at a density of 150,000 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes buffer, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and incubated overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 24 h of incubation, cells were washed once with OPTI-MEM I reduced serum medium and then transfected using 3 μg of plasmid DNA to 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well. After 2 h, regular growth medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum was added directly to the transfectants. Cells were incubated an additional 35–40 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, before a radioligand competition binding assay was performed. Binding Assay—The affinity of nonpeptide GnRH antagonists to the mutant/chimeric receptors was determined by a competitive ligand binding assay. Transfected cells were washed once with binding assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl). The assay was initiated by adding ∼0.1 nm labeled [125I-Tyr5,d-Leu6,NMeLeu7,Pro9-Net]GnRH agonist and varying concentrations of competitor to the cells at 400 μl of final volume. After 1 h of incubation at 23 °C, cells were washed 4 times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in a buffer containing 0.2 N NaOH and 1% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were transferred to polystyrene tubes, and bound radioligand was measured by direct γ counting. Ki values were calculated from competition binding curves for each independent experiment using non-linear least square regression and corrected for radioligand concentration using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (20Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) (Prism, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) assuming a KD of 0.2 nm for all mutants. Mean Ki values are calculated from the antilog of the mean of the pKi values for each receptor ligand pair. Nonpeptide Binding To Wild-type Receptors—The affinity of three nonpeptide GnRH antagonists representing three distinct chemical families (Fig. 1) was evaluated for GnRH binding potency using a competitive radioligand binding assay. The results are shown in Table I and Fig. 2. All three compounds show high affinity binding to the human receptor (Ki = 3.4, 2.9, and 1.2 nm for compounds I, II, and III, respectively. When compounds were tested for the macaque receptor, a 25- to 40-fold decrease in affinity was observed. Even greater selectivity was seen against the rat receptor, where compound III bound with an apparent Ki of 2.4 μm and both compounds I and II bound with very low affinities (Ki >10 μm). The binding affinity of the peptide used to prepare the radioligand, [d-Leu6,NMeLeu7,Pro9-Net]GnRH, was nearly equivalent between species. Affinity of this peptide was tested for most of the mutations or chimeras discussed below, and no substantial effects on peptide affinity were observed (data not shown).Table ISpecies-selective binding of nonpeptide antagonists to GnRH receptorsCompoundBinding affinityHumanMacaqueRatKi(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)nmnmI3.4(8.5 ± 0.0)87(7.1 ± 0.1)>10 μmII2.9(8.5 ± 0.1)120(6.9 ± 0.1)>10 μmIII1.2(8.9 ± 0.1)32(7.5 ± 0.1)2400 nm(5.6 ± 0.1)[dLeu6,NMeLeu7,Pro9-NEt]GnRH0.6(9.2 ± 0.1)0.4(9.4 ± 0.1)0.2 nm(9.6 ± 0.1) Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Species-selective binding profile of nonpeptide antagonists to GnRH receptors.

To simplify the discussion, the corresponding human residue numbers are used to refer to amino acid positions in the rat sequence. Thus, residues 191–327 in the actual rat sequences are referred to as 192–328 to account for the deletion of Lys-191. To explore which residues might be responsible for the observed difference in nonpeptide binding affinity, we sequentially replaced each of these 5 residues in the human receptor with the macaque counterpart. As shown in Table II, mutant receptors containing point mutations at residues Ser-203 in extracellular loop II or Leu-300 in extracellular loop III showed a ∼5- to 15-fold loss in nonpeptide binding affinity when replaced with the corresponding macaque residues Pro-203 or Val-300. Simultaneous introduction of both S203P and L300V mutations into the human receptor resulted in somewhat lower nonpeptide affinity than the wild-type macaque receptor for compounds I and II (240 nm compared with 87 nm for compound I and 340 compared with 120 nm for compound II). This was even more pronounced for compound III (310 nm compared with 32 nm for the macaque GnRHR). Therefore, although substitutions S203P and L300V are sufficient to account for the loss of binding affinity observed in the macaque receptor, it appears that other residues may also somewhat mitigate this loss. Conversely, replacing both residues in the macaque receptor with the corresponding human residues, macaque GnRHR(P203S,V300L), restored nearly full nonpeptide binding affinity, suggesting that these residues alone account for the observed human/macaque affinity differences.Table IIResidues 203 in ECL2 and 300 in ECL3 determine human/macaque selectivity for nonpeptide bindingReceptorBinding affinityCompound ICompound IICompound IIIKi(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)nmnmnmhGnRHR3.4(8.5 ± 0.0)2.9(8.5 ± 0.1)1.2(8.9 ± 0.1)macGnRHR87(7.1 ± 0.1)120(6.9 ± 0.1)32(7.5 ± 0.1)hGnRHR(A16V)6.7(8.2 ± 0.2)2.9(8.5 ± 0.1)0.9(9.0 ± 0.1)hGnRHR(L112F)3.6(8.4 ± 0.1)4.5(8.4 ± 0.1)1.2(8.9 ± 0.0)hGnRHR(S203P)38(7.4 ± 0.1)21(7.7 ± 0.2)aMean ± S.E. from two independent experiments.5.6(8.2 ± 0.1)hGnRHR(F225L)3.5(8.5 ± 0.2)aMean ± S.E. from two independent experiments.2.5(8.6 ± 0.2)1.3(8.9 ± 0.2)hGnRHR(L300V)39(7.4 ± 0.2)42(7.4 ± 0.1)11(8.0 ± 0.2)hGnRHR(S203P, L300V)240(6.6 ± 0.2)340(6.5 ± 0.1)310(6.5 ± 0.1)macGnRHR(P203S, V300L)6.7(8.2 ± 0.1)3.3(8.5 ± 0.1)1.7(8.8 ± 0.0)a Mean ± S.E. from two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Residues Conferring Human/Rat Selectivity—The high degree of selectivity observed between the human and rat GnRH receptors was somewhat surprising because of the high homology (87%) of these two proteins. In all, 40 residues differ between the rat and human sequences, with ∼25 possibly accessible to extracellular ligands (Fig. 3).3 A chimeric approach was devised to elucidate which regions contributed to the species selectivity of nonpeptide ligands. As shown in chimeras rGnRH(h1–33), rGnRH(h1–175), and rGnRH(h1–208), nonpeptide affinity increased as the amount of human amino terminus contribution increased (Table III). For example, compound II shows no measurable binding in the rat receptor, 470 nm affinity to the rGnRH(h1–33) chimera, 270 nm affinity to the rGnRH(h1–175) chimera, and 14 nm affinity to the rGnRH(h1–208) chimera (Table III). This increase can be attributed to two specific regions. As can be seen in the rGnRH(h1–33) chimera, a greater than 10-fold increase in nonpeptide affinity is gained relative to the rGnRH wild-type by just replacing the amino-terminal domain with the corresponding human sequence. Although little or no further improvement in affinity is observed by the addition of the human 34–175 region (comparing the rGnRH(h1–33) and rGnRH(h1–175) chimeras), a 30- to 40-fold increase in affinity, depending on compound, is gained in the rGnRH(h1–208) relative to the rGnRHh(h1–33) chimera, indicating that additional residues in extracellular loop II are contributing substantially to species selectivity. This was confirmed in the rGnRH(h1–33, 176–208) chimera where nonpeptide affinity for compound I is 80 nm, compound II is 42 nm, and compound III is 23 nm (Table III). Although these two regions restore most of the affinity when present in combination, it should be noted that the chimera containing extracellular loop II by itself failed to gain sufficient affinity to allow measurement of binding affinity.Table IIIRat/human chimeras localize nonpeptide selectivity determinants to the amino terminus and ECL2 Open table in a new tab To further map residues responsible for selectivity in the amino terminus and extracellular loop II regions, two point mutation studies were carried out. As shown in Table IV, 5 residues within the rat amino terminus, Asn-4, Leu-7, Asp-10, Thr-24, and Lys-27, were systematically mutated to the human counterpart. Of the five point mutants, only the T24M receptor showed a measurable gain in affinity. Compound I bound to the rGnRHR(T24M) point mutant with an apparent Ki of 4.3 μm, compound II bound with an apparent Ki of 3.5 μm, and compound III bound with an apparent Ki of 500 nm (Table IV). The reciprocal mutation, hGnRHR(M24T), resulted in reduction of nonpeptide affinity for the human receptor by approximately three orders of magnitude, suggesting that Met-24 is critical for high affinity binding to the human receptor. However, although this point mutation reduced affinity of the human receptor for compound III to that of the rat receptor, compounds I and II still bound with higher affinity than the rat receptor, suggesting that the binding mode of compound III is somehow different from I and II. Simply removing the threonine hydroxyl by replacing Thr-24 with alanine in the rat receptor did not improve binding, suggesting that reduced affinity is not a disrupting effect of the threonine residue. Although emphasis can be placed on the 24th position, it is evident that no single point mutant restores binding affinity to the same degree as seen in the rGnRH(h1–33) chimera, indicating that combinations of more subtle interactions between Met-24 and other residues in the region may also contribute to nonpeptide affinity, albeit to a lesser degree. Further, if one compares the nearly 5-fold improvement in binding of compound III achieved by the rGnRHR(T24M) mutant relative to the native rat receptor with the nearly 2000-fold loss in affinity caused by the reciprocal hGnRHR(M24T) mutation in the human receptor, it appears likely that Met-24 is involved in organizing an extracellular region of the receptor for high affinity nonpeptide binding, rather than simply contributing a direct interaction with the ligand.Table IVAmino-terminal residue Met-24 is required for high affinity binding of nonpeptides to the human GnRH receptorReceptorBinding affinityCompound ICompound IICompound IIIKi(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)nmhGnRHR3.4 nm(8.5 ± 0.0)2.9 nm(8.5 ± 0.1)1.2(8.9 ± 0.1)rGnRHR>10 μm>10 μm2400(5.6 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33)870 nm(6.1 ± 0.1)470 nm(6.3 ± 0.1)150(6.8 ± 0.0)rGnRHR(N4S)9600 nm(5.0 ± 0.1)>10 μm3100(5.5 ± 0.2)rGnRHR(L7P)>10 μm>10 μm3900(5.4 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(D10N)>10 μm>10 μm5600(5.3 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(T24M)4300 nm(5.4 ± 0.0)3500 nm(5.5 ± 0.1)500(6.3 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(K27N)>10 μm>10 μm5400(5.3 ± 0.0)rGnRHR(T24A)>10 μm>10 μm7200(5.1 ± 0.1)hGnRHR(M24T)2500 nm(5.6 ± 0.2)2800 nm(5.6 ± 0.1)2300(5.6 ± 0.2) Open table in a new tab To localize residues in extracellular loop II that confer the binding activity of the 176–208 region of the human receptor, the 7 residues that differ between rat and human in this region (Tyr-182, Gly-186, Pro-189, Ala-190, Δ-191, Pro-203, and Glu-208) were systematically mutated to the human counterpart. To obtain measurable changes in binding affinity, these point mutants were constructed within the context of the r-GnRH(h1–33) chimera. As shown in Table V, the rGnRHR(h1–33,E208Q) mutation showed the largest improvement in affinity for all three compounds and E208Q could account for the bulk of binding energy provided for by the human 176–208 region. Compound I bound to the E208Q mutant with an apparent Ki of 110 nm, compound II bound with an apparent Ki of 83 nm, and compound III bound with an apparent Ki of 52 nm, as compared with 80, 42, and 23 nm, respectively, for the complete human ECL2 region. Replacement of this residue alone, without the human 1–33 sequence (rGnRHR(E208Q)), did not observably improve binding. However, changing this residue alone in the human sequence to the rat side chain (hGnRHR(Q208E)) resulted in a 10- to 25-fold loss in potency. It therefore appears that although Gln-208 is necessary for high affinity nonpeptide binding, like Met-24 this residue is required for organizing an extracellular region but cannot alone substantially interact with nonpeptide ligands. A smaller contribution of the P203S to nonpeptide binding was also observed, consistent with the observations in the macaque receptor.Table VGln-208 at the ECL2/TM5 interface is required for high affinity binding of nonpeptides to the human GnRH receptorReceptorBinding affinityCompound ICompound IICompound IIIKi(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)nmhGnRHR3.4 nm(8.5 ± 0.0)2.9 nm(8.5 ± 0.1)1.2(8.9 ± 0.1)rGnRHR>10 μm>10 μm2400(5.6 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33)870 nm(6.1 ± 0.1)470 nm(6.3 ± 0.1)150(6.8 ± 0.0)rGnRHR(h1-33, 176-208)80 nm(7.1 ± 0.1)42 nm(7.4 ± 0.1)23(7.6 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,Y182H)750 nm(6.1 ± 0.1)200 nm(6.7 ± 0.1)91(7.0 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,G186S)770 nm(6.1 ± 0.1)330 nm(6.5 ± 0.2)140(6.8 ± 0.0)rGnRHR(h1-33,P189Q)1700 nm(5.8 ± 0.1)750 nm(6.1 ± 0.0)260(6.6 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,A190T)890 nm(6.1 ± 0.1)280 nm(6.6 ± 0.1)150(6.8 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,191K)850 nm(6.1 ± 0.0)290 nm(6.5 ± 0.1)95(7.0 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,P203S)410 nm(6.4 ± 0.1)170 nm(6.8 ± 0.2)76(7.1 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(h1-33,E208Q)110 nm(7.0 ± 0.1)83 nm(7.1 ± 0.1)52(7.3 ± 0.1)rGnRHR(E208Q)>10 μm>10 μm4200(5.4 ± 0.3)hGnRHR(Q208E)91 nm(7.0 ± 0.1)28 nm(7.6 ± 0.0)7.8(8.1 ± 0.1) Open table in a new tab Although replacement of the amino terminus and ECL2 in the rat receptor by the corresponding human sequences in the rGnRH(h1–33, 176–208) chimera resulted in substantial improvement in nonpeptide binding affinity, the full affinity of the human receptor was not fully restored, indicating that additional residues are required. Both rat and macaque GnRH receptors differ from the human receptor by the presence of Val-300 (Leu-300 in the human). As was discussed above, the hGnRH(L300V) point mutant decreases nonpeptide affinity by 9- to 14-fold. When the reciprocal mutation (rGnRHR(V300L)) was introduced into the rat receptor, a measurable affinity was regained for nonpeptides I and II relative to the wild-type rGnRHR (Table VI); however, no effect on binding of compound III was observed, again suggesting a somewhat different mode of binding for compound III. To determine whether the effect of this residue was additive or cooperative with other regions, the V300L substitution was introduced into the rGnRH(h1–33, 176–208) chimera. The resulting chimera, rGnRH(h1–33, 176–208,V300L), binds compound I with an apparent Ki of 7.3 nm, compound II binds with an apparent Ki of 2.7 nm, and compound III binds with an apparent Ki of 1.4 nm, corresponding to an 11- to 16-fold improvement in affinity and essentially restoring full human receptor affinity. However, when the V300L substitution is introduced with T24M alone, or in the rGnRH(h176–208/T24M) construct, only a 5- to 8-fold increase in affinities of all three nonpeptides is observed, suggesting that the full contribution of Leu-300 requires amino-terminal residues in addition to Met-24. Further evidence for cooperative action with other residues in the amino terminus and ECL2 comes from introduction of all four major humanizing mutations into the rat receptor (rGnRH(T24M,P203S,E208Q,V300L)), which still has 70-, 50-, and 20-fold reduced affinity for compounds I, II and III, respectively, compared with the native human receptor.Table VIAbility of extracellular residues and regions to restore high affinity nonpeptide binding to the rat GnRH receptorReceptorBinding affinityCompound ICompound IICompound IIIKi(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)Ki(-pKi)nmhGnRHR3.4 nm(8.5 ± 0.0)2.9 nm(8.5 ± 0.1)1.2(8.9 ± 0.1)rGnRHR>10 μm>10 μm2400(5.6 ± 0.1)hGnRHR(L30"
https://openalex.org/W2043296093,"We previously reported, both in transfected cells and in human T-cell leukemia virus type-2 subtype B infected cells, that the viral transactivator Tax-2B protein could inhibit p53 functions. We have now investigated the mechanism through which Tax-2B represses p53 using GFPTax-2B fusion proteins. We present evidence that Tax-2B inhibition of p53 function is not linked to CREB/ATF activation, but is uniquely correlated with the interaction of CREB binding protein (CBP), but not p300, with the C-terminus of Tax-2B. Wild type, but not a Tax-2B-M47 mutant, inhibits p53 function in adherent cells. We demonstrate that both Tax-2B and Tax-2B-M47 can bind p300, while Tax-2B-M47 is impaired for CBP binding. Importantly, transfection of increasing amounts of CBP but not p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) could rescue p53 transcriptional activity in the presence of Tax-2B in nonlymphocytic cells. In lymphoid cells, Tax-2B mediated inhibition of p53 is correlated with the NF-κB pathway activation and could be prevented by the overexpression of an IκBα mutant. Given the similarities between the functional domains of CBP and p300, these results are intriguing and suggest that Tax-2B must bind the CR2 domain of CBP, but not that of p300 in order to repress p53."

In purple non-sulfur bacteria, electron transfer reactions involved in the conversion of light energy into biochemically amenable energy are performed by the photosynthetic apparatus. This complex system includes the photosynthetic reaction center (RC), 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; HiPIP, high potential iron-sulfur protein; HP, high potential; LP, low potential; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; indel, inserted and deleted region; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. 1The abbreviations used are: RC, reaction center; HiPIP, high potential iron-sulfur protein; HP, high potential; LP, low potential; WT, wild type; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; indel, inserted and deleted region; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. the cytochrome bc1 complex, and water-soluble electron carrier proteins in the periplasmic space and quinone molecules in the membrane. The primary process of photosynthetic electron transfer involves the RC in promoting the light-induced charge separation and stabilization, which results in oxidation of the primary electron donor P, the bacteriochlorophyll special pair, and reduction of a quinone to a semiquinone. Soluble electron carrier proteins transport electrons to the RC where the photo-oxidized special pair is rereduced. These soluble electron carriers are rereduced in turn by a quinol molecule via the cytochrome bc1 complex. This so-called cyclic electron transfer occurring between these different electron carriers is coupled to proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane, creating a protonmotive force that drives ATP synthesis.The RC is a transmembrane protein complex consisting of at least three polypeptides, namely the L, M, and H subunits. Apart from the three subunits, a fourth polypeptide, the C (cytochrome) subunit, is found on the periplasmic side of the RC in most purple bacteria. The fourth subunit, also known as the RC-bound cytochrome or tetraheme cytochrome, is a c-type cytochrome that accepts electrons from soluble electron carriers. In general, this RC-bound cytochrome contains four hemes differentiated by their redox properties: two hemes are high potential (HP), and two others are low potential (LP) (1Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3161-3168Google Scholar, 2Nitschke W. Agalidis I. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 49-57Google Scholar).

(1Nitschke W. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3161-3168Google Scholar, 8Verméglio A. Richaud P. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 259-263Google Scholar, 9Alegria G. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 258-272Google Scholar).Two types of soluble electron carrier proteins have been shown to act as the electron donors to the RC-bound cytochrome. One is a c-type cytochrome. Several crystal structures of c-type cytochromes have been determined (10Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK2001: 33-43Google Scholar), including cytochrome c complexed with the cytochrome bc1 (Protein Data Bank code 1KYO (11Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Google Scholar)). The other type of soluble electron carrier is an iron-sulfur protein (12Kerfeld C. Chan C. Hirasawa M. Kleis-SanFrancisco S. Yeates T. Knaff D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7812-7818Google Scholar, 13Hochkoeppler A. Zannoni D. Ciurli S. Meyer T. Cusanovich M. Tollin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6998-7002Google Scholar) that contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Due to the high redox midpoint potential compared with ferredoxins, this electron carrier was designated as “high potential” iron-sulfur protein or HiPIP. Several crystal structures for HiPIPs have been determined (10Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK2001: 33-43Google Scholar, 14Nogi T. Miki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 319-329Google Scholar). In species like B. viridis and Rhodoblastus acidophilus, only c-type cytochromes are found, e.g. either cytochrome c2 or cytochrome c8. Rubrivivax gelatinosus, Ectothiorhodospira shaposhnikovi, Rhodoferax fermentans, Rhodocyclus tenuis, Allochromatium vinosum, and Marichromatium purpuratum utilize both types of electron transfer mediators, i.e. the HiPIP and the high potential c-type cytochrome. In R. gelatinosus, the HiPIP is the major electron donor to the RC under phototrophic anoxygenic growth conditions (15Schoepp B. Parot P. Menin L. Gaillard J. Richaud P. Vermeglio A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11736-11742Google Scholar, 16Nagashima K.V. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Vermeglio A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14028-14032Google Scholar), while the HP cytochrome c8 becomes dominant when cells have been grown under dark aerobic conditions (17Menin L. Yoshida M. Jaquinod M. Nagashima K.V. Matsuura K. Parot P. Vermeglio A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15238-15244Google Scholar). Such adaptability in bioenergetic processes has also been found in A. vinosum (18Verméglio A. Li J. Schoepp-Cothenet B. Pratt N. Knaff D.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8868-8875Google Scholar).Studies on in vitro electron transfer to the bound cytochromes modified by site-directed mutagenesis in R. gelatinosus have suggested that different amino acids of the RC-bound cytochrome are implicated in specific binding for the c-type cytochrome or HiPIP (19Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Google Scholar, 20Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15779-15790Google Scholar, 21Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2861-2865Google Scholar). These binding sites are located on the subunit surface close to the most distant accessible heme, the LP heme 4(I) (see also Ref. 22Knaff D. Willie A. Long J. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Google Scholar). A mutant strain, C244, lacking the RC-bound cytochrome was derived from the R. gelatinosus IL144 strain by inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette to inactivate the pufC gene (23Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Google Scholar). Although this mutant is able to grow under phototrophic condition, its growth rate is 4–5-fold decreased compared with the wild type. A spontaneous revertant strain, C244-P1, which presents a normal growth rate, was obtained from C244. The amino acid sequence of the C244-P1 RC-bound cytochrome shows that an insertion of 77 residues, originally from the kanamycin cassette, is located between residues 164 and 165 (in WT amino acid sequence) (24Yoshida M. Masuda S. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 897-900Google Scholar).In the present work, we performed spectral, structural, and functional analysis on the RC-bound cytochromes from the WT and C244-P1 strains. The spatial arrangement of the four hemes in the RC-bound cytochrome was determined by EPR. The electron transfer mechanisms of the WT and C244-P1 strains were obtained by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Our results showed that the spatial arrangement of the four hemes of the RC-bound cytochrome is not affected by the insertion of the 77 amino acids. On the other hand, this additional 77-residue segment in C244-P1 interferes with the binding of cytochrome c8 but not HiPIP to the RC-bound cytochrome likely by spatially hindering the approach of cytochrome c8 to its binding site. This led us to propose a comprehensive docking structure for identifying the binding sites for soluble electron carriers as well as the critical residues involved in binding and to construct the three-dimensional structure of the RC-bound cytochrome for the WT strain by comparative modeling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESC244-P1 Isolation and Growth—Cells of R. gelatinosus C244 strain, which was derived from the wild type strain IL144 and in which the gene coding the RC-bound cytochrome is disrupted by an insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette (23Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Google Scholar), were photosynthetically grown in a PA medium containing 0.5% (w/v) sodium pyruvate, 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1% (v/v) basal salt solution, 0.1% (v/v) vitamin solution (25Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Wakao N. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1249-1258Google Scholar), and 0.1% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The photosynthetic growth rate of C244 cells was 4–5 times slower than that of the wild type cells. Continuous transfer of the growing cultures of C244 to the new medium containing no antibiotics resulted in appearance of revertant cultures showing nearly the same growth rates as that of the wild type culture. The revertant cells were isolated on solid medium containing 1.5% agar. One clone of the revertant cultures was named strain C244-P1.Sample Preparations—Cells of R. gelatinosus WT IL144 and C244-P1 strains were grown under either dark aerobic or phototrophic anaerobic conditions in Hutner medium for 24 h. The altered pufC gene in the C244-P1 strain was sequenced and confirmed, through PCR amplification, by DNA sequence analysis using a 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) (26Nagashima K.V. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Google Scholar). To obtain the membrane fraction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8, and disrupted by French press at 50 megapascals. The remaining intact cells were separated from the membrane supernatant by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The membrane fraction was then sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g for 90 min and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7. HP cytochrome c8 was purified as described previously (17Menin L. Yoshida M. Jaquinod M. Nagashima K.V. Matsuura K. Parot P. Vermeglio A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15238-15244Google Scholar) except for the use of a R. gelatinosus strain depleted for both HiPIP and the LP cytochrome c8. Cytochrome c8 purity was checked by gel chromatography and monitoring the ratio between the absorption in the Soret band and at 280 nm.EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were taken at 15 K using a Bruker ER 300 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments helium cryostat and a temperature control system. Instrumental conditions were set at 6.7-milliwatt microwave power, the microwave frequency was 9.43 GHz, and the modulation amplitude was 2.5 milliteslas. For EPR spectroscopy, membranes were diluted in a mixture of 20 mm MOPS and 2 mm ferricyanide at pH 7 to oxidize the heme groups, and the solution was pelleted and resuspended in 20 mm EDTA at pH 7 to remove manganese and ferricyanide. Finally the resulting membrane mixture was washed once more by centrifugation and resuspension in 20 mm MOPS at pH 7. Angular dependence of EPR signals was investigated on oriented membrane multilayer obtained by drying the membrane fragments onto Mylar sheets.Time-resolved Spectroscopy—Time-resolved optical spectra were measured by a laboratory-built pulsed laser spectrophotometer with high sensitivity (27Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1999; 70: 202-207Google Scholar). The tunable laser source is a Surelite optical parametric oscillator (Continuum). The sample was photoexcited by a laboratory-made broadband dye laser pumped by a neodynium-yttrium aluminum garnet laser (LDS 821) with a wavelength range from 780 to 850 nm. The absorbance change in the cytochrome α-band was recorded in the time scale of ∼100 ns to ∼s.Construction of Molecular Three-dimensional Structures—We applied a comparative modeling strategy to build the framework of molecules. Alteration of backbone atomic positions was permitted only within inserted and deleted regions (indels). Side chains were replaced according to the corresponding protein sequence, and their atomic coordinates were minimized using our in-house program (28Chen S.W. Pellequer J.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 595-605Google Scholar). Indels were built with computational graphics using the programs Turbo-Frodo (29Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar) and Xfit (30McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-47Google Scholar). By this way, gaps of the backbone trace created by indels were filled by adjusting neighboring ϕ,ψ dihedral angles until the optimal bond length of the gap was reached. The atomic coordinates of final models were energy-minimized using X-PLOR 3.8 (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) with the Charmm22 all-atom force field parameters (32MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fisher S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher III, W.E. Roux B. Schlenkrich M. Smith J.C. Stote R. Straub J. Watanabe M. Wiorkiewicz-Kuczera J. Yin D. Karplus M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 3586-3616Google Scholar). Each comparative model was built in the presence of its native ligand, i.e. a c-type heme group for cytochrome c8 and a [4Fe-4S] cluster for HiPIP. Appropriate patches were included when running X-PLOR to take into account thioester linkages in the c-type hemes. In this work, we built three comparative models from the species R. gelatinosus: the RC-bound cytochrome, cytochrome c8, and HiPIP.We selected the RC-bound cytochrome of T. tepidum (Protein Data Bank code 1EYS (7Nogi T. Fathir I. Kobayashi M. Nozawa T. Miki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13561-13566Google Scholar)) as the template for our RC-bound cytochrome based on the global sequence alignment. It has fewer indels (four regions) and higher sequence identity (53%) to our molecular construction than B. viridis (Protein Data Bank code 1PRC (33Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Google Scholar)), which introduces eight indels and has lower sequence identity (49%). We used our superposition program, Sup3D, to perform superposition of 3D structures (28Chen S.W. Pellequer J.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 595-605Google Scholar).We used cytochrome c551 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the template for cytochrome c8. The two proteins share about 49% sequence identity. We selected the reduced form of c551 (Protein Data Bank code 451C (34Matsuura Y. Takano T. Dickerson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 389-409Google Scholar)) to build the structural framework because it possesses the highest resolution (1.6 Å) and best R-factor (0.187) among all the c551 crystal structures in Protein Data Bank. According to multiple sequence alignments, residue Gly39 in the template (451C) was deleted, and three residues were inserted at position 63 for cytochrome c8. Since the insertion region is near the heme and a conserved helix, we tilted the C-terminal helix to shift its N terminus away from the heme by about 2.6 Å such that there is enough space to accommodate the three inserted residues. We chose the crystal structure of HiPIP from R. fermentans (A chain in the Protein Data Bank code 1HLQ (35Gonzalez A. Benini S. Ciurli S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1582-1588Google Scholar)) to build the model of the R. gelatinosus HiPIP. They share 60% sequence identity. The multiple sequence alignment indicates that only one residue inserted at position 47 is needed to accomplish the modeling.Molecular Docking Simulations—Several interesting functional and structural features are shared by the cytochrome bc1 complex and the RC-bound cytochrome complexed with soluble electron carriers. First, both bind with the same soluble cytochrome in the photosynthetic pathway. Second, both have a heme group partially exposed to solvent. Therefore, we assumed that the complex structure of the RC-bound cytochrome associated with cytochrome c8 is similar in space to that of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex with its soluble cytochrome partner (Protein Data Bank code 1KYO (11Lange C. Hunte C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2800-2805Google Scholar)). Consequently docking of cytochrome c8 to the RC-bound cytochrome was simulated based on the following. First, we superimposed atoms named FE, ND, NB, NC, and NA of the bc1 heme group one-to-one onto FE, NA, NC, NB, and ND of heme 4(I) (see Fig. 7A below). This superposition placed the bc1 cytochrome in a configuration similar to the RC-associated cytochrome, i.e. the His and Met axial ligands coincide in the two structures. Note that the sequence ordering of amino acids coordinated with the heme groups of the cytochrome bc1 complex and the RC-bound cytochrome are reverse. Second, we superimposed cytochrome c8 onto cytochrome c of 1KYO by mapping atoms FE, NA, NB, NC, and ND in the heme groups of both soluble cytochromes. The procedure put cytochrome c8 at a plausible docking site on the surface of the RC-associated cytochrome. Third, armed with mutagenesis data (19Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Google Scholar), we developed a set of restrained distances between the side chain atoms of cytochrome c8 and the RC-bound cytochrome. More explicitly, the distance restraint for atom CBC of heme 4(I) and that of the cytochrome c8 heme is 5 Å. Similarly distances for atomic pairs Glu79-Oϵ1, Lys21-Nζ, and Glu93-Oϵ1, Lys8-Nζ are 3 and 5 Å, respectively. 3There is a discrepancy in the literature about the residue numbering in R. gelatinosus. In Refs. 19Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Google Scholar, 20Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15779-15790Google Scholar, 21Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2861-2865Google Scholar, experiments were performed on R. gelatinosus, while the numbering was borrowed from B. viridis. Thus, published mutants Val67, Glu79, Glu93, and Leu96 correspond to R. gelatinosus residues Val65, Glu77, Glu91, and Leu94, respectively. A rigid body energy minimization was performed by using the X-PLOR nuclear Overhauser effect statement to incorporate the distance restraints. We assigned the averaged interatomic distance to the center of a square-well potential function used in minimization. The ceiling of the potential was set to 1000 with a scaling factor of 10. Other running variables were by default.Docking HiPIP was performed with computational graphics using InsightII (MSI Inc., San Diego, CA). We identified a large hydrophobic patch on the HiPIP surface formed by residues Leu15, Leu43, Pro56, Leu57, Ala71, and Ala73. We tested multiple orientations between the hydrophobic patch and two critical residues, Val65 and Leu94, of the RC-bound cytochrome (20Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Sogabe S. Miki K. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15779-15790Google Scholar, 21Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2861-2865Google Scholar). We also carried out a rigid body energy minimization to refine the complex structure with various sets of distance restraints until the total potential energy was converged and shape complementarity was visually satisfactory. An additional set of distance restraints required for HiPIP docking includes 10 Å for Fe-3 of HiPIP and iron of the RC-bound cytochrome heme 4(I) group, 4 and 5 Å for atomic pairs Gln55-Cδ, Leu43-Cγ and Ser46-Cβ, Leu15-Cγ in the paired complex, respectively. We used the program BURIED, a variant of the MSMS software (36Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.-C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Google Scholar), for calculating the solvent-excluded surface. The value of the parameter density was set to 15. The atomic radii were taken from the CHARMM22 all-atom force field parameters. To obtain the non-polar and polar contributions, we separated the surfaces of carbon and sulfur atoms from that of oxygen and nitrogen atoms.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGrowth Rate and Genetic Analysis of C244-P1—The photosynthetic growth rate of R. gelatinosus strain C244 in which the gene coding for the RC-bound cytochrome, pufC gene, is disrupted by an insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette was 4–5 times slower than that of the wild type in the growth medium used in this study. A revertant strain named C244-P1, obtained from the C244 cultures grown in the medium without kanamycin, restored the photosynthetic growth near to the level of that in the WT strain (Fig. 1A). Sequencing the pufC gene locus in C244-P1 showed that the kanamycin resistance cassette was lost except for 110 bases from the 5′-end and 121 bases from the 3′-end (Fig. 1, B and C). This means that 231 bases derived from the non-coding region of the cassette are included in the C244-P1 pufC gene. This insertion sequence does not contain any stop codons in the reading frame, meaning that the RC-bound cytochrome of C244-P1 has an external 77-amino acid insertion at the region between the HP heme 3(II) and LP heme 1(III) (Fig. 1C). We ascribed the reversion of the photosynthetic growth in C244-P1 to the recovery of synthesis of the RC-bound cytochrome, although the sequence was altered from WT.Fig. 1Characteristics of R. gelatinosus strain C244-P1.A, photosynthetic growth of R. gelatinosus IL144, C244, and C244-P1. The growth of the bacteria was measured by optical density at 660 nm. Doubling times were calculated to be 5.9 h for WT (○), 28.5 h for C244 (•), and 8.1 h for C244-P1 (▴).

Anaerobic dark adaptation of the sample allows the reduction of all four hemes prior to excitation. Under these conditions, excitation by a saturating flash induces the photooxidation of the LP hemes. A continuous illumination of low intensity photo-oxidizes the two LP hemes but leaves the two HP hemes reduced. A superimposed excitation by a saturating flash under these conditions induces the photo-oxidation of the HP hemes. The time-resolved flash-induced absorbance changes for the dark-adapted IL144 and C244-P1 samples are presented in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. For an anaerobic dark-adapted sample, the decrease in absorbance peaking at 552 nm is indicative of photo-oxidation of the LP hemes of RC-bound cytochrome concomitant with the reduction of the photo-oxidized primary donor. When the sample was exposed to far red light (λ > 700 nm) of 50 milliwatts·cm–2 (Fig. 2, D and E), photo-oxidation of a cytochrome peaking at 555 nm was observed. This is indicative of the photo-oxidation of the HP hemes. Fig. 2, C and F, shows that the interheme electron transfer involving either the LP or the HP hemes is identical for the WT and the C244-P1 strains.Fig. 2Difference absorption spectra in the α-band of cytochromes. Spectra recorded at various times after light excitation for the WT IL144 (A and D) or C244-P1 (B and E) whole cells placed either under dark-adapted anaerobic conditions (A and B, LP hemes reduced before the flash) or in the presence of a continuous near infrared light of 50 milliwatts·cm–2 (D and E, only HP hemes reduced before the flash). The kinetics of cytochrome oxidation under HP or LP (C and F) are plotted for better comparison. r.u., renormalized units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The spatial arrangement of the hemes in the WT and C244-P1 RC-bound cytochromes was determined by EPR spectroscopy.
