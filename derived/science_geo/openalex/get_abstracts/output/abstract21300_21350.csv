https://openalex.org/W1989187665,The sequence of a Pst I restriction fragment was determined that demonstrate instability in fragile X syndrome pedigrees. The region of instability was localized to a trinucleotide repeat p(CCG)n. The sequence flanking this repeat were identical in normal and affected individuals. The breakpoints in two somatic cell hybrids constructed to break at the fragile site also mapped to this repeat sequence. The repeat exhibits instability both when cloned in a nonhomologous host and after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. These results suggest variation in the trinucleotide repeat copy number as the molecular basis for the instability and possibly the fragile site. This would account for the observed properties of this region in vivo and in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2093830420,"Both the integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1 bind to ICAM-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily member. Previously, we localized the binding sites of LFA-1 and the major group of human rhinoviruses to the first NH2-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of ICAM-1. Here, we show that the binding site on ICAM-1 for Mac-1 is unexpectedly distinct from that for LFA-1 and maps to the third NH2-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain. These findings provide a function for the tandem duplication of immunoglobulin-like domains in ICAM-1 and have implications for other immunoglobulin superfamily members. Mutations at two sites in the third domain that destroy consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation enhance binding to purified Mac-1. Agents that interfere with carbohydrate processing provide evidence that the size of the N-linked oligosaccharide side chains on ICAM-1 affects binding to Mac-1 but not to LFA-1. Thus, we suggest that the extent of glycosylation on ICAM-1 may regulate adhesion to LFA-1 or Mac-1 in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2110614029,"The natriuretic peptides are hormones that can stimulate natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant activity in vivo, presumably through the activation of two known cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclases (ANPR-A and ANPR-B). Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and, to a lesser extent, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are efficient activators of the ANPR-A guanylyl cyclase, neither hormone can significantly stimulate ANPR-B. A member of this hormone family, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), potently and selectively activated the human ANPR-B guanylyl cyclase. CNP does not increase guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing human ANPR-A. The affinity of CNP for ANPR-B is 50- or 500-fold higher than ANP or BNP, respectively. This ligand-receptor pair may be involved in the regulation of fluid homeostasis by the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2018186094,"We characterized the distribution of AGAMOUS (AG) RNA during early flower development in Arabidopsis. Mutations in this homeotic gene cause the transformation of stamens to petals in floral whorl 3 and of carpels to another ag flower in floral whorl 4. We found that AG RNA is present in the stamen and carpel primordia but is undetectable in sepal and petal primordia throughout early wild-type flower development, consistent with the mutant phenotype. We also analyzed the distribution of AG RNA in apetela2 (ap2) mutant flowers. AP2 is a floral homeotic gene that is necessary for the normal development of sepals and petals in floral whorls 1 and 2. In ap2 mutant flowers, AG RNA is present in the organ primordia of all floral whorls. These observations show that the expression patterns of the Arabidopsis floral homeotic genes are in part established by regulatory interactions between these genes."
https://openalex.org/W1980642537,"The expression of two alternative splice variants, Flip and Flop, in mRNAs encoding the four AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (GluR-A, -B, -C, and -D) was studied in the developing brain by in situ hybridization. These receptors are expressed prominently before birth, and patterns of distribution for Flip versions remain largely invariant during postnatal brain development. In contrast, the Flop versions are expressed at low levels prior to postnatal day 8. Around this time, the expression of Flop mRNAs increases throughout the brain, reaching adult levels by postnatal day 14. Thus, receptors carrying the Flop module appear to participate in mature receptor forms."
https://openalex.org/W2008299115,"A mutant mouse strain without CD8 (Lyt-2 and Lyt-3) expression on the cell surface has been generated by disrupting the Lyt-2 gene using embryonic stem cell technology. In these mice, CD8+ T lymphocytes are not present in peripheral lymphoid organs, but the CD4+ T lymphocyte population seems to be unaltered. Cytotoxic response of T lymphocytes from these mice against alloantigens and viral antigens is dramatically decreased. Proliferative response against alloantigens and in vivo help to B lymphocytes, however, are not affected. These data suggest that CD8 is necessary for the maturation and positive selection of class I MHC restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes but is not required on any of the intermediate thymocyte populations (CD8+CD4-TcR- or CD4+CD8+TcRlow) during the development of functional class II MHC restricted helper T cells."
https://openalex.org/W1999000941,"Genetic factors contribute to heart disease. In this study, linkage analyses have been performed in a family that is predisposed to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, the long QT syndrome (LQT). A DNA marker at the Harvey ras-1 locus (H-ras-1) was linked to LQT with a logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage (lod score) of 16.44 at theta = 0, which confirms the genetic basis of this trait and localizes this gene to the short arm of chromosome 11. As no recombination was observed between LQT and H-ras-1, and there is a physiological rationale for its involvement in this disease, ras becomes a candidate for the disease locus."

https://openalex.org/W2064025268,"The molecular mechanisms used to generate neuronal diversity are largely unknown. To identify genes controlling cell fate in the Drosophila central nervous system, we screened for mutations that alter expression of homeobox genes in the developing central nervous system (indicating changes in cell fates). We also screened ""enhancer trap"" lines to identify genes expressed in neuronal stem cells (neuroblasts). The prospero gene was discovered in both screens. prospero is expressed in a subset of neuroblasts, sensory neuron precursors, and identified glial precursors. It is not expressed in neurons. Neuroblasts lacking prospero function generate abnormal cell lineages, producing incorrectly specified progeny that differentiate into neurons showing axon pathfinding defects. prospero is therefore a novel type of gene expressed in neuroblasts and known to specify neuronal fate."

https://openalex.org/W2074210550,"The homeobox gene en, homologous to the gene engrailed of Drosophila, is expressed in the metencephalic-mesencephalic segment of the vertebrate neural tube. Using quail-chick chimeras, an antibody against en proteins, and cytoarchitectonic techniques, we demonstrate that metencephalon transplanted to prosencephalon, at E2, maintains a high level of en proteins and its presumptive cerebellar fate. The ectopic metencephalon induces in the contiguous host prosencephalon the expression of en and, subsequently, a mesencephalic phenotype. These related genetic and phenotypic expressions indicate that the transcriptional regulatory en gene is involved in cerebellar and mesencephalic cytodifferentiation. The expression of en can also be induced in chick prosencephalon by a mammalian metencephalic graft, indicating that the factors regulating the transcription of en are phylogenetically well conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2041864652,"Long-term potentiation (LTP), an in vitro model of learning, was induced in hippocampal slices by 5-hertz stimulation. During induction, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) inhibition decreased, causing the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated excitation to increase. 2-OH Saclofen, a GABAB receptor antagonist, prevented the reduction of inhibition, the increase of excitation, and the induction of LTP. Therefore, disinhibition caused by GABAB receptors is required for induction of LTP by 5-hertz stimulation. GABAB receptor modulation of synaptic plasticity occurs at frequencies in the range of the endogenous hippocampal theta rhythm, which has been shown to modulate LTP in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2015096068,"Interactions between cytotoxic lymphocytes and their targets require the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and the integrin lymphocyte function-associated molecule-1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18). LFA-1 is not constitutively avid for its counterreceptors, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs)-1 and -2. Cross-linking of the TCR transiently converts LFA-1 to a high avidity state and thus provides a mechanism for regulating cellular adhesion and de-adhesion in an antigen-specific manner. Truncation of the cytoplasmic domain of the β, but not the α, subunit of LFA-1 eliminated binding to ICAM-1 and sensitivity to phorbol esters. Thus, LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1 was found to be regulated by the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit of LFA-1."
https://openalex.org/W2047488088,"We have used a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect MyoD mRNA during early embryonic development of Xenopus laevis. We find that during a short period of time following the midblastula transition MyoD becomes transcriptionally activated at a low level ubiquitously throughout the embryo. Restriction of MyoD expression to muscle precursor cells appears as a subsequent event, in which the process of mesoderm induction stabilizes transcription only in the marginal zone of the embryo, the presumptive mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2010383806,"AMPA but not kainate produces a rapidly desensitizing response in mouse hippocampal neurons. The characteristic action of these agonists appears to arise from activation of a single receptor with active and desensitized states, for which AMPA and kainate have different relative affinity. The equilibrium potency of a series of five agonists that produce rapidly desensitizing responses at non-NMDA receptors (EC50 1 μM to 4 mM) was similar to their equilibrium potency for block of kainate responses. Increasing the concentration of kainate overcame such block, but in the presence of AMPA the rate of activation of responses to kainate was slowed. Conversely, in the presence of kainate the amplitude of rapidly desensitizing responses evoked by AMPA was reduced, and the rate of onset of desensitization was slowed."
https://openalex.org/W2089398626,"Somatic sex determination in Drosophila involves a hierarchy of regulated alternative pre-mRNA processing. Female-specific splicing and/or polyadenylation of doublesex (dsx) pre-mRNA, the final gene in this pathway, requires transformer (tra) and transformer-2 (tra-2) proteins. The mechanisms by which these proteins regulate RNA processing has not been characterized. In this paper we show that tra-2 produced in Escherichia coli binds specifically to a site within the female-specific exon of dsx pre-mRNA. This site, which contains six copies of a 13 nucleotide repeat, is required not only for female-specific splicing, but also for female-specific polyadenylation. These observations suggest that tra-2 is a positive regulator of dsx pre-mRNA processing."
https://openalex.org/W1514044463,"Photoreceptor guanylate cyclase was solubilized and purified from bovine rod outer segments with 50-150-fold increase in specific activity using the nonionic detergent n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside. Guanylate cyclase activities correlated with the enrichment of a protein with an apparent Mr = 112,000. The purified enzyme showed specific activities of 100-700 nmol of cGMP produced/min/mg protein and exhibited positive cooperativity with respect to MnGTP (Hill coefficient n = 1.6 +/- 0.1). The apparent Km was 274 +/- 67 microM, and the turnover number was determined to be 0.2-1.3 cGMP produced/s. The molar ratio of the 112-kDa protein to rhodopsin corresponds to 1:104. This indicates that the amount of guanylate cyclase in rod photoreceptors is nearly equimolar to the amount of the phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1521786414,"DNA polymerase alpha, delta and epsilon can be isolated simultaneously from calf thymus. DNA polymerase delta was purified to apparent homogeneity by a four-column procedure including DEAE-Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and hydroxylapatite, yielding two polypeptides of 125 and 48 kDa, respectively. On hydroxylapatite DNA polymerase delta can completely be separated from DNA polymerase epsilon. By KCl DNA polymerase delta is eluted first, while addition of potassium phosphate elutes DNA polymerase epsilon. DNA polymerases delta and epsilon could be distinguished from DNA polymerase alpha by their (i) resistance to the monoclonal antibody SJK 132-20, (ii) relative resistance to N2-[p-(n-butyl)phenyl]-2-deoxyguanosine triphosphate and 2-[p-(n-butyl)anilino]-2-deoxyadenosine triphosphate, (iii) presence of a 3'—-5' exonuclease, (iv) polypeptide composition, (v) template requirements, (vi) processivities on the homopolymer poly(dA)/oligo(dT12-18), and (vii) lack of primase. The following differences of DNA polymerase delta to DNA polymerase epsilon were evident: (i) the independence of DNA polymerase epsilon to proliferating cell nuclear antigen for processivity, (ii) utilization of deoxy- and ribonucleotide primers, (iii) template requirements in the absence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, (iv) mode of elution from hydroxylapatite, and (v) sensitivity to d2TTP and to dimethyl sulfoxide. Both enzymes contain a 3'—-5' exonuclease, but are devoid of endonuclease, RNase H, DNA helicase, DNA dependent ATPase, DNA primase, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. DNA polymerase delta is 100-150 fold dependent on proliferating cell nuclear antigen for activity and processivity on poly(dA)/oligo(dT12-18) at base ratios between 1:1 to 100:1. The activity of DNA polymerase delta requires an acidic pH of 6.5 and is also found on poly(dT)/oligo(dA12-18) and on poly(dT)/oligo(A12-18) but not on 10 other templates tested. All three DNA polymerases can be classified according to the revised nomenclature for eukaryotic DNA polymerases (Burgers, P.M. J., Bambara, R. A., Campbell, J. L., Chang, L. M. S., Downey, K. M., Hubscher, U., Lee, M. Y. W. T., Linn, S. M., So, A. G., and Spadari, S. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 191, 617-618)."
https://openalex.org/W2077343981,"Norepinephrine is an endogenous neurotransmitter that reduces synaptic inhibition onto pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus by an action at an alpha-adrenergic receptor. The physiological mechanism of this disinhibition was previously not known, except that it occurred at a site presynaptic to the inhibited pyramidal cell. In this paper we present evidence that adrenergic disinhibition is restricted to the early phase of the evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potential in area CA1 of the hippocampus. The locus of disinhibition does not appear to reside in the interneuronal terminal, axon, or cell body. Instead, adrenergic agonists appear to reduce evoked synaptic inhibition by depressing excitatory synapses that activate the interneuron."
https://openalex.org/W119567604,"Several structural features of the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 including phosphorylation of Ser-408 have been shown to be important in its endocytosis (Shin, J., Doyle, C., Yang, Z., Kappes, D., and Strominger, J.L. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 425-434). A series of cytoplasmic domain truncations have now indicated that the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain from Arg-396 to Lys-417 is sufficient for phorbol ester-induced internalization; this segment is predicted to be an alpha-helix. The severe impairment of endocytosis resulting from the mutation Ser-408 to Ala-408 is largely restored by a compensating mutation Ala-404 to Ser-404; phosphorylation of Ser-404 has been directly demonstrated. Furthermore, mutation of Met-407, Ile-410, Leu-413, or Leu-414 to a hydrophilic residue eliminated CD4 endocytosis as did domain truncation at Arg-412. Ser-408 was normally phosphorylated in all of these mutants, suggesting that other residues in this region, including the four hydrophobic amino acids, are also required for CD4 endocytosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy following staining of intact and permeabilized cells showed that all endocytosis defective mutants indeed remained on the cell surface even after phorbol ester treatment, while wild type CD4 was endocytosed and degraded in lysosomes. These data indicate that endocytosis requiring residues 397-417 and binding of lymphocyte tyrosine kinase at residues 417-429 are functions of independent segments of the cytoplasmic region and lead to a hypothesis regarding some features of the endocytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1974990705,"DNA sequences associated with the mouse pink-eyed unstable mutation were identified in the absence of closely linked molecular markers and without prior knowledge of the encoded gene product. This was accomplished by ""genome scanning,"" a technique in which high-resolution Southern blots of genomic DNAs were hybridized to a dispersed and moderately repetitive DNA sequence. In this assay, pink-eyed unstable DNA was distinguished from the DNA of wild-type and revertant mice by enhanced hybridization to one of several hundred resolved fragments. The fragment showing enhanced hybridization in pink-eyed unstable DNA was cloned and found to lie within a DNA duplication that is located close to, or within, the pink-eyed dilution locus. The duplication associated with the mouse pink-eyed unstable mutation may mediate the high reversion frequency characteristic of this mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2142039118,"Transgenic mice carrying multiple copies of the human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene have been produced. The transgenes were transcribed correctly and expressed specifically in brain and adrenal gland. The level of human TH mRNA in brain was about 50-fold higher than that of endogenous mouse TH mRNA. In situ hybridization demonstrated an enormous region-specific expression of the transgene in substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. TH immunoreactivity in these regions, though not comparable to the increment of the mRNA, was definitely increased in transgenic mice. This observation was also supported by Western blot analysis and TH activity measurements. However, catecholamine levels in transgenics were not significantly different from those in nontransgenics. These results suggest unknown regulatory mechanisms for human TH gene expression and for the catecholamine levels in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1563961309,"Aminopeptidase N is a membrane-bound metalloprotease expressed on the surface of normal and malignant human myeloid cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and the epithelial cells that form brush borders of the small intestine and kidney. Northern blot analysis of RNA extracted from these tissues revealed two distinct aminopeptidase N transcripts: a 3.7-kilobase (kb) transcript expressed by normal monocytes, myeloid leukemia cells, and fibroblasts and a 3.4-kb transcript expressed by intestinal epithelium and kidney cells. In intestinal epithelial cells, transcripts originated 47 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon and 22 base pairs downstream from a TATA box. By contrast, the longer transcripts found in myeloid cells and fibroblasts originated from several sites clustered in an upstream exon located 8 kb from the exon containing the initiation codon. Functional promoter activity was demonstrated by fusing sequences approximately 1 kb upstream from each transcription origin to bacterial reporter genes and transfecting the resultant constructs into murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. A novel feature of this system is that regulatory elements of the epithelial cell promoter, including the TATA box and transcription origin, are included within the 5'-untranslated region of the longer myeloid cell transcript. Both aminopeptidase N transcripts encode the same polypeptide, indicating that the physically distinct promoters must have evolved to regulate expression of this cell-surface peptidase by cells of different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1600740368,"Abstract The human gene for the recently identified 5-lipoxy-genase-activating protein (FLAP) has been cloned. The gene was isolated from two different genomic libraries and is contained within four overlapping bacteriophage clones. The gene spans greater than 31 kilobases and consists of five small exons and four large introns. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggests the presence of a single FLAP gene per haploid genome. A restriction site polymorphism was identified in intron II of the gene. This restriction fragment length polymorphism appears to be present in the normal population at a fairly high frequency. The transcription initiation site was located, at an adenine residue, 74 base pairs upstream of the ATG initiation codon. Examination of the sequence of the gene 5' to the mRNA start site revealed the presence of a possible TATA box (TGTAAT) 22 base pairs upstream and potential AP-2 and glucocorticoid receptor binding sites. Functional analysis of the FLAP gene promoter was assayed by transient transfection of mouse P388D1 cells (macrophage) and human HepG2 cells (hepatoma) with 5'-flanking sequences of the FLAP gene fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Expression in the mouse macrophage cell line of the various FLAP gene promoter constructs revealed both tissue specificity and enhancer-like activities whereas in the hepatoma cell line only a minimum level of activity was obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2048040506,"The anteroposterior character of mesoderm induced by a peptide growth factor (XTC-MIF) was tested by transplantation into host Xenopus gastrulae. Both retinoic acid and a homeodomain protein were able to override the anteriorizing effect of the growth factor. Microinjection of a posteriorly expressed homeobox mRNA can respecify anteroposterior identity, transforming head mesoderm into tail-inducing mesoderm. Unexpectedly, overexpression of XIHbox 6 protein in the transplanted cells, without addition of growth factors, caused the formation of tail-like structures. The cells overexpressing XIHbox 6 were able to recruit cells from the host into the secondary axis. The results suggest that vertebrate homeodomain proteins are part of the biochemical pathway leading to the generation of the body axis."
https://openalex.org/W2125326104,"c-erbB, encoding the EGF receptor (EGF-R), was originally identified as the cellular homolog of a chicken leukemia oncogene. In humans, EGF-R is distributed widely except in hemopoietic tissues, and its amplification is associated with epidermal and glial malignancies. Here we show that c-erbB is present in normal chicken erythrocytic progenitors and transmits the mitogenic signal induced by TGF alpha. Cells that contain high affinity EGF-R are at approximately the BFU-E stage, and their long-term renewal can be induced by TGF alpha. Upon addition of insulin and erythropoietin, they can be induced to terminally differentiate into red cells. We previously demonstrated that v-erbA blocks differentiation of chicken erythrocytic progenitors but does not abrogate their growth factor dependence for proliferation. These data indicate that proliferation and differentiation are not necessarily coupled in these cells. They also demonstrate a direct role of c-erbB in the control of self-renewal of normal chicken erythrocytic progenitors and could account for the predominant leukemogenic potential of the chicken erbB gene."
https://openalex.org/W1606240307,"Biosynthetic thiolase from Zoogloea ramigera was inactivated with a mechanism-based inactivator, 3-pentynoyl-S-pantetheine-11-pivalate (3-pentynoyl-SPP) where K1 = 1.25 mM and kinact = 0.26 min-1, 2,3-pentadienoyl-SPP obtained from nonenzymatic rearrangement of 3-pentynoyl-SPP where K1 = 1.54 mM and kinact = 1.9 min-1 and an affinity labeling reagent, acryl-SPP. The results obtained with the alkynoyl and allenoyl inactivators are taken as evidence that thiolase from Z. ramigera is able to catalyze proton abstraction uncoupled from carbon-carbon bond formation. The inactivator, 3-pentynoyl-SPP and the affinity labeling reagent, acryl-SPP, trap the same active site cysteine residue, Cys-378. To assess if Cys-378 is the active site residue involved in deprotonation of the second molecule of acetyl-CoA, a Gly-378 mutant enzyme was studied. In the thiolysis direction the Gly-378 mutant was more than 50,000-fold slower than wild type and over 100,000-fold slower in the condensation direction. However, the mutant enzyme was still capable of forming the acetyl-enzyme intermediate and incorporated 0.81 equivalents of 14C-label after incubation with [14C]Ac-CoA for 60 min. The reversible exchange of 32P-label from [32P]CoASH into Ac-CoA, catalyzed by the Gly-378 mutant enzyme, proceeded with a Vmax (exchange) 8,000-fold less than the wild type enzyme but at least 10-fold faster than the overall condensation reaction. These data provide evidence that Cys-378 is the active site base."

https://openalex.org/W1530137778,"Thyroid hormone receptors are cellular homologues (c-erbAs) of the v-erbA oncoprotein of the avian erythroblastosis virus. Exclusive of the viral gag region, v-erbA differs from the chick c-erbA-alpha receptor by two amino acid changes N-terminal of the DNA binding domain, two amino acid changes in the DNA binding domain, nine amino acid changes in the C-terminal region corresponding to the ligand binding domain of c-erbA, and a nine-amino acid deletion near the C terminus. v-erbA does not bind thyroid hormone and when expressed in cells inhibits the activity of wild-type thyroid hormone receptors. We reported previously that mutants of chick c-erbA/thyroid hormone receptor which lack the DNA binding domain (DBD-) inhibit transcriptional activition by wild-type thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors (Forman, B. M., Yang, C.-R., Au, M., Casanova, J., Ghysdael, J., and Samuels, H. H. (1989) Mol. Endocrinol. 3, 1610-1626). This dominant negative activity mapped to a series of hydrophobic heptad motifs which are conserved in the C terminus of these receptors and have been suggested to play a role in receptor dimerization. In this study we show that unlike DBD- c-erbA, DBD- v-erbA does not block receptor activity, suggesting that v-erbA acts by competing for DNA response elements rather than by formation of nonfunctional v-erbA/c-erbA heterodimers. This difference in activity was localized to a single Pro to Ser change in v-erbA just N-terminal of the last heptad motif. Introduction of this Pro to Ser change into DBD- c-erbA resulted in a protein which was inactive both functionally and in blocking receptor dimer formation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1985733387,"FMRFamide evokes both short-term and long-term inhibition of synapses between mechanosensory and motor neurons in Aplysia. We report here, using dissociated cell culture and low-light epifluorescence video microscopy, that depression lasting 24 hr of sensorimotor synapses evoked by four brief applications of FMRFamide is accompanied by a significant loss of sensory cell varicosities and neurites. These structural changes in the sensory cells require the presence of the target motor cell L7. Because the loss of structures known to contain transmitter release sites correlates significantly with the changes in the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential in L7, our results suggest that the structural changes evoked by FMRFamide reflect a loss of synaptic contacts. Thus, long-term depression parallels long-term facilitation of the sensorimotor synapse produced by serotonin in that both forms of heterosynaptic plasticity involve target-dependent modulation of the number of presynaptic varicosities."
https://openalex.org/W1555440776,"The product of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene is the co-factor of DNA polymerase delta, which is required for cellular and viral DNA replication. Its steady-state mRNA levels are growth-regulated in young human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) as well as in many other cell types. In senescent HDF, PCNA mRNA is not detectable. However, the PCNA gene is transcribed in senescent HDF as efficiently as in young cells. Furthermore, PCNA hnRNA is easily detectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in both senescent and young HDF, and the levels are essentially similar. These results indicate that in senescent HDF which are incapable of synthesizing cellular DNA, one of the genes coding for a protein of the DNA-synthesizing apparatus is still transcribed, but the product fails to be processed into mature mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1488243761,"We have identified a unique N-glycosylated Asn substitution for a Ser at position 434 of the A alpha chain of an abnormal fibrinogen designated fibrinogen Caracas II. This dysfibrinogen was characterized by impaired fibrin monomer aggregation. Since there were 4 Thr residues immediately following the mutation, a new Asn-X-Thr/Ser-type consensus sequence, Asn-Thr-Thr arose for N-glycosylation of the Asn. The extra oligosaccharide was found to consist mainly of a disialylated biantennary structure comprising 81.9%, while a neutral and a monosialylated biantennary oligosaccharide represented only 3.6% and 14.5%, respectively. The mutation resides in the carboxyl-terminal region of the A alpha chain, which could fold back to form an extra small globular region located near the central region of the molecule (Erickson, H.P., and Fowler, W.E. (1983) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 408, 146-163; Weisel, H.P., Stauffacher, C.V., Bullitt, E., and Cohen, C. (1985) Science 230, 3124-3133). Therefore, the participation of this region, referred to as an additional central domain or an alpha domain, in fibrin gel formation is strongly implicated."
https://openalex.org/W1519886297,"The neuroparalytic activities of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT A), tetanus toxin (TeTx), or homologous and heterologous combinations of their constituent polypeptides were examined at cholinergic and non-cholinergic synapses of Aplysia californica. When applied extracellularly, BoNT A or a mixture of its heavy (HC) and light (LC) chains were far more potent in blocking transmitter release at cholinergic than non-cholinergic synapses. The reverse was true for TeTx or a mixture its constituent chains. Such selectivity was assigned to differences in neuronal targetting and uptake of the neurotoxins since both exhibited similar potencies when injected directly into the cell body of either cell type. When bath-applied, heterologous combinations of the toxins' HC and LC appeared as effective as the parent neurotoxins from whence each HC was derived. Moreover, targetting/internalization was attributable to the analogous N-terminal moieties, H2 and beta 2, of the HC from BoNT A and TeTx. Thus, it may be postulated that the latter regions possess two functional domains, one being distinct and responsible for the divergent neuronal specificity, whereas the other serves a common role in translocating the LC of either toxin. Also, it was shown that the C-terminal portion of the HC of TeTx is unable to play the intracellular role of its counterpart in BoNT A."
https://openalex.org/W1604773547,"Sterols reduce the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) transcriptionally by inhibiting the synthesis of reductase mRNA and posttranscriptionally by accelerating degradation of the enzyme. We and others have described mutant lines of Chinese hamster fibroblasts that are completely resistant to sterol-mediated repression of transcription of HMG-CoA reductase as well as two other sterol-regulated genes, HMG-CoA synthase and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. In the current studies, we show that one line of sterol-resistant mutant cells (SRD-3 cells) retains the ability to slow the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase by 7-fold in response to treatment with compactin, an inhibitor of reductase that blocks sterol synthesis. The compactin effect is reversed by exogenous sterols. Similar results were obtained with another mutant line of sterol-resistant cells (SRD-2 cells) whose defective transcriptional regulation is attributable to a different gene than that in the SRD-3 cells, as determined by complementation analysis. These data indicate that the gene products that are defective in the SRD-3 and SRD-2 cells are not required for the sterol-mediated regulation of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Thus, mammalian cells possess at least two genetically distinct mechanisms, one transcriptional and the other posttranscriptional, for sensing and responding to the intracellular level of sterols."
https://openalex.org/W1544281217,"Physiological stress induces tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine biosynthesis, via trans-synaptic mechanisms within the adrenal medulla. Previous studies have implicated cAMP as a second messenger capable of inducing tyrosine hydroxylase; however, it is unclear whether any receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase mediates tyrosine hydroxylase induction. Recently, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, whose receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase in many tissues, has been shown to meet many of the criteria for a neuromodulator within the adrenal medulla. We therefore undertook a series of studies to determine whether vasoactive intestinal polypeptide may induce tyrosine hydroxylase in PC12 cells, a cell line derived from rat adrenal medulla. Here we report that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide produces a transient, time- and concentration-dependent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels which is followed by a stable increase in tyrosine hydroxylase protein. The increase in tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA does not occur in a mutant PC12 cell line deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, indicating that the effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is mediated through the cAMP second messenger pathway. This is the first report demonstrating that a neuromodulator which acts on an adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor can induce tyrosine hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1555105226,"The beta-amyloid peptide precursor (beta-APP) exists in brain tissue as a membrane-associated protein extractable with 1% Triton X-100. beta-APP has been purified to near homogeneity by the following procedure: 1) anion exchange chromatography, 2) affinity chromatography on heparin agarose, and 3) immunoaffinity adsorption on matrix-bound antibodies directed to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 24 amino acids of the cDNA derived amino acid sequence of beta-APP. Conditions were chosen to minimize denaturation of the protein. The identity of the protein was confirmed by its immunoreactivity with antisera directed to five subsequences derived from the cDNA sequence. The amino-terminal sequence of beta-APP was found to be Leu-Glu-Val-Pro-Thr-Asp-Gly-Asn-Ala-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ala-Glu-Pro, which commences at residue 18 of the cDNA-derived primary structure. The procedure resulted in a 2000-fold purification of beta-APP. The purified protein migrated on polyacrylamide gels as a doublet of apparent molecular mass 100-120 kDa, although the predicted molecular mass of its constituent amino acids is 76 kDa. beta-APP clearly behaves anomalously in gel electrophoresis. The beta-APP content of rat brain amounted to 46 micrograms/g tissue. The half-life of the protein was calculated to be about 10 h, which is 30 times as long as that observed by others in transfected PC-12 cells. We conclude that transfected cell systems may not be adequate models for beta-APP processing."

https://openalex.org/W1527943903,"Incubation of tobacco and lettuce thylakoids with 2 M LiCl in the presence of MgATP removes the beta subunit from their CF1-ATPase (CF1 beta) together with varying amounts of the CF1 alpha subunit (CF1 alpha). These 2 M LiCl extracts, as with the one obtained from spinach thylakoids (Avital, S., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7067-7072), could form active hybrid ATPases when reconstituted into inactive beta-less Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores. Pure CF1 beta fractions that have been isolated from these extracts could not form such active hybrids by themselves, but could do so when supplemented with trace amounts (less than 5%) of CF1 alpha. A mitochondrial F1-ATPase alpha subunit was recently reported to be a heat-shock protein, having two amino acid sequences that show a highly conserved identity with sequences found in molecular chaperones (Luis, A. M., Alconada, A., and Cuezva, J. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 7713-7716). These sequences are also conserved in CF1 alpha isolated from various plants, but not in F1 beta subunits. The above described reactivation of CF1 beta by trace amounts of CF1 alpha could thus be due to a chaperonin-like function of CF1 alpha, which involves the correct, active folding of isolated pure CF1 beta."
https://openalex.org/W1502720586,"Effects of nitric oxide (NO) on hemodynamic and glycogenolytic responses to platelet-activating factor (PAF) and phenylephrine were investigated in perfused livers derived from fed rats. Infusion of NO (34 microM) into perfused livers inhibited PAF (0.22 nM)-induced increases in hepatic glucose output and portal pressure approximately 90 and 85%, respectively, and abolished effects of PAF on hepatic oxygen consumption. NO attenuated PAF-stimulated increases in glucose output and portal pressure, the latter indicative of hepatic vasoconstriction, with a similar dose dependence with an IC50 of approximately 8 microM. In contrast to its effects on PAF-induced responses in the perfused liver, NO inhibited increases in hepatic portal pressure in response to phenylephrine (10 microM) approximately 75% without altering phenylephrine-stimulated glucose output and oxygen consumption. Similarly, infusion of NO into perfused livers significantly inhibited increases in hepatic portal pressure but not in glucose output in response to a submaximal concentration of phenylephrine (0.4 microM). Like NO, sodium nitroprusside (83 microM) significantly inhibited hemodynamic but not glycogenolytic responses to phenylephrine in perfused livers. However, PAF (0.22 nM)-stimulated alterations in hepatic portal pressure, glucose output, and oxygen consumption were unaffected by infusion of sodium nitroprusside (83 microM) into perfused livers. These results provide the first evidence for regulatory effects of NO in the perfused liver and support the contention that PAF, unlike phenylephrine, stimulates glycogenolysis by mechanisms secondary to hepatic vasoconstriction. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that NO may act in liver to regulate hemodynamic responses to vasoactive mediators."
https://openalex.org/W1502436923,"We recently reported the 5'-flanking nucleotide sequence of a putative glutamine synthetase (GS) gene from 3T3-L1 cells (Bhandari, B., Beckwith, K. D. & Miller, R. E. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 5789-5793). We now find that this gene (GSr) has many, but not all, of the characteristics of a typical retroposon. It lacks introns, it contains a short poly(A) tract at its 3' end; it is flanked by 10-base pair (bp) direct repeats; and it corresponds closely at its 5' end to the transcription start site of the intron-containing GS gene (GSi) (Kuo, C. F. & Darnell, J. E., Jr. (1989) J. Mol. Biol. 208, 45-56). GSr includes a full-length, uninterrupted coding sequence that differs little (less than 5%) from that of the intron-containing gene. By contrast, the 5'-flanking sequence of GSr has no similarity with that of GSi. The first 1,029 bp of the GSr 5'-flanking sequence drives expression of a promoterless bacterial chloramphenical acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in transfected HeLa cells at a level comparable to that of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Analysis of variably deleted GSrCAT fusions genes in both HeLa and 3T3-L1 cells indicates that full promoter activity of the 1,029-bp sequence requires greater than 348 bp. Moreover, nuclear extract from 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as murine liver protects four segments in the GSr 5'-flanking sequence from DNase I digestion. Nevertheless, reverse transcription of RNA from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mouse adipocytes, or mouse liver followed by primer-directed enzymatic amplification of the reverse transcripts reveals the presence of GSi transcripts but the absence of GSr transcripts. Thus, the 5'-flanking sequence of GSr is an active promoter that drives transcription of GSrCAT fusion genes and includes binding domains for proteins that have the potential to regulate transcription. We conclude that the intronless murine GS gene isolated from 3T3-L1 cells arose as a retroposon that was inserted into the genome downstream of a potentially active promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1492113892,"Kainate receptors are present in high concentrations in goldfish brain (Henley and Oswald, 1988a and b; Ziegra et al., 1990), possibly in neuronal and glial cells. In a number of systems, the kainate receptor has been assumed to be an integral ion channel (Watkins and Evans, 1981); but, for some kainate receptors, ion channel activity has not been demonstrated (Wada et al., 1989). This study presents evidence that a portion of the [3H]kainate-binding sites in goldfish brain is sensitive to guanine nucleotides, with a loss of high affinity binding in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs. Pertussis toxin pretreatment of membranes causes a loss of high affinity [3H]kainate binding and of the guanine nucleotide-sensitive binding. Pertussis toxin catalyzes the specific [32P]ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa substrate in a kainate-sensitive manner. In addition, incorporation of [alpha-32P]GTP-gamma-azidoanilide by photoaffinity labeling was enhanced in the presence of kainate. These results indicate that a subpopulation of [3H]kainate-binding sites in goldfish brain may be coupled to G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1653222247,"Turkey ovomucoid third domain with P1 Leu18 at its reactive site is an excellent inhibitor of chymotrypsin and elastase and of many other serine proteinases with related specificities. Semisynthetic replacement of P1 Leu18 by Lys18 causes the expected change into a trypsin inhibitor. Strikingly, semisynthetic replacement P1 Leu18 to Glu18 changes turkey ovomucoid third domain into a powerful inhibitor of Glu-specific Streptomyces griseus proteinase, GluSGP. Of the 131 natural avian ovomucoid third domains we have sequenced none have P1 Glu18, but several avian ovomucoid first domains have P1 Glu24. They are weak to moderate inhibitors of GluSGP."
https://openalex.org/W1503329225,"To investigate the functional role of glutamic acid 350 in the active site of the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium, we have replaced this residue by glutamine or alanine by use of site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complexes were expressed, purified, crystallized, and characterized by spectroscopic and kinetic studies with several substrates. We find large alterations in the substrate and reaction specificity of each mutant form of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Since the two mutant enzymes are virtually inactive in reactions with L-serine but are active in reactions with beta-chloro-L-alanine, glutamic acid 350 may facilitate the beta-elimination of the weak hydroxyl leaving group of L-serine. The mutant alpha 2 beta 2 complexes are more active than the wild type enzyme in the beta-elimination reaction with beta-chloro-L-alanine. These enzymes are irreversibly inactivated by beta-chloro-L-alanine, whereas the wild type enzyme is not. These altered properties may result from a change in the conformation of the active site, from a change in the orientation of the coenzyme relative to active site residues, or from a change in the solvent accessibility of the active site. The alteration in the active site may enhance the release of amino acrylate from the Schiff base intermediate by hydrolysis or by transamination."
https://openalex.org/W1547680358,"Somatostatin (SRIF) is a peptide hormone that is synthesized as part of a larger precursor, prepro-SRIF, consisting of a signal peptide and a proregion of 80-90 amino acids. The mature hormone exists as two different bioactive species. In addition to the most common form, which is a 14-residue peptide, there is also a 14-amino acid NH2-terminally extended form of the tetradecapeptide, SRIF-28. In mammals a single prepro-SRIF molecule undergoes tissue-specific processing to generate the mature hormone, whereas in some species of fish separate genes encode two distinct but homologous precursors, prepro-SRIF-I and -II, that give rise to SRIF-14 and -28, respectively. To investigate the molecular basis for differential processing of the prohormones, we have expressed their cDNAs in heterologous cells. Previously, we demonstrated that prepro-SRIF-I was efficiently and accurately processed in rat pituitary growth hormone (GH3) cells to generate the same hormone as synthesized in pancreatic islet D-cells, namely SRIF-14 (Stoller, T., and Shields, D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6922-6928). We have now compared the proteolytic processing of pro-SRIF-II to that of pro-SRIF-I in these cells. In contrast to pro-SRIF-I, pro-SRIF-II was neither processed nor secreted. Instead, greater than 70% of the precursor was degraded intracellularly in a post-trans Golgi network compartment which was inhibited by weak bases. Brefeldin A treatment prevented degradation, suggesting that turnover of the remaining pro-SRIF-II occurred after exit from the endoplasmic reticulum/intermediate compartment and prior to arrival at the trans Golgi network. The intracellular degradation of the precursor was unexpected, since heterologous cells which do not cleave prohormones generally secrete the unprocessed precursor. We speculate that unique structural domains within each precursor are recognized by the sorting apparatus in GH3 cells, thereby targeting the molecules to different intracellular organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1486006892,"Radiation inactivation has been used to evaluate the molecular size of domains responsible for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-binding and cyclase functions of the ANP receptor/guanylate cyclase. Two types of inactivation curves were observed for cyclase function in both adrenal cortex and aortic smooth muscle cells: 1) biphasic with enhanced guanylate cyclase activity after exposure to low radiation doses and 2) linear after preincubation of membrane proteins with 0.5 microM ANP or solubilization with Triton X-100. The existence of an inhibitory component was the simplest model that best explained the types of radiation curves obtained. Activation of guanylate cyclase by ANP or Triton X-100 could occur via the dissociation of this inhibitory component from the catalytic domain. On the other hand, the loss of ANP-binding activity was linear with increasing radiation exposures under basal, ANP treatment, and Triton X-100 solubilization conditions. Radiation inactivation sizes of about 30 kDa for cyclase function, 20 kDa for ANP-binding function, and 90 kDa for inhibitory function were calculated. These studies suggest that the ANP receptor/guanylate cyclase behaves as a multidomain protein. The results obtained by radiation inactivation of the various biological functions of this receptor are compatible with the hypothesis of an intramolecular inhibitory domain repressing the guanylate cyclase catalytic domain within its membrane environment."
https://openalex.org/W1592691636,"A monoclonal antibody, 188C1, raised against skin tissue from the back of bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) was found to recognize a common antigen in neural and intestinal tissues of chicken (Fujita, S. (1989) in Biological Transduction Mechanisms (Kasai, M., Yoshioka, T., and Suzuki, H., eds) pp. 159-177, Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo Japan). The 188C1 antigen was isolated from chick intestinal tissues and characterized as a novel ganglioside by means of Q-Sepharose and Iatrobeads column chromatography, and chemical, immunochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses. The chemical structure was as follows: Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer Fuc alpha 1-3 NeuAc alpha 2-3 This represents a novel hybrid structure of type 2 Le(x) epitope and GM1 ganglioside core structure, designated as Le(x)-GM1. Monoclonal antibody 188C1 reacted strongly with Le(x)-GM1 on thin layer chromatography, but its reactivity was greatly reduced when sialic acid was removed from the antigen. This indicated that the internal sialic acid residue might participate in antigenicity of the Le(x) determinant. In addition to 188C1, a more specific antibody reacting with Le(x)-GM1 but not with asialo-Le(x)-GM1 was raised by immunizing a rabbit with Le(x)-GM1. TLC/enzyme immunostaining using this specific antibody showed the presence of Le(x)-GM1 in chick intestinal tissue, but not in chick brain."
