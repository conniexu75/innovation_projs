https://openalex.org/W2045101135,"Cationic liposomes complexed with DNA (CL-DNA) are promising synthetically based nonviral carriers of DNA vectors for gene therapy. The solution structure of CL-DNA complexes was probed on length scales from subnanometer to micrometer by synchrotron x-ray diffraction and optical microscopy. The addition of either linear λ-phage or plasmid DNA to CLs resulted in an unexpected topological transition from liposomes to optically birefringent liquid-crystalline condensed globules. X-ray diffraction of the globules revealed a novel multilamellar structure with alternating lipid bilayer and DNA monolayers. The λ-DNA chains form a one-dimensional lattice with distinct interhelical packing regimes. Remarkably, in the isoelectric point regime, the λ-DNA interaxial spacing expands between 24.5 and 57.1 angstroms upon lipid dilution and is indicative of a long-range electrostatic-induced repulsion that is possibly enhanced by chain undulations."

Here, we report that LXRα and LXRβ, two orphan members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, are activated by 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at physiologic concentrations. In addition, we have identified an LXR response element in the promoter region of the rat cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene.

Cholesterol (CH) 1The abbreviations used are: CHcholesterolCYP7Acholesterol 7α-hydroxylaseRXRretinoid X receptorCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseDRdirect repeattkthymidine kinase. is a major structural constituent of cellular membranes and serves as the biosynthetic precursor for bile acids and steroid hormones. Animal cells can obtain CH endogenously through de novo synthesis from acetyl-CoA or exogenously through receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoproteins. Cells must balance the internal and external sources of CH so as to maintain mevalonate biosynthesis while at the same time avoiding the accumulation of excess CH, which can result in diseases such as atherosclerosis, gallstones, and several lipid storage disorders (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). cholesterol cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase retinoid X receptor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase direct repeat thymidine kinase. CH homeostasis is maintained in part through feedback regulation of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene and at least two genes encoding enzymes in the CH biosynthetic pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). Although increases in dietary CH lead to the inhibition of expression of these genes in vivo, it remains unclear whether CH or CH metabolites are responsible for this inhibition (2Lund E. Björkhem I. Acc. Chem. Res. 1995; 28: 241-249Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments performed in vitro using several different cell lines have indicated that derivatives of CH that are oxygenated on the CH side chain are significantly more potent in the suppression of sterol biosynthesis than CH (3Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. Heiniger H.-J. Science. 1978; 201: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). These oxysterols are produced through the actions of P450 enzymes in various metabolic pathways including bile acid synthesis in the liver and sex hormone synthesis in the adrenal glands. The in vitro activities of oxysterols together with their presence in vivo suggests that oxysterols may serve in metabolic feedback loops to regulate CH homeostasis. Although CH and its oxysterol metabolites can repress gene transcription, in at least one instance dietary CH has been shown to stimulate gene expression. Expression of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A) gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the initial and rate-limiting step in the conversion of CH to bile acids (4Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 135-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is up-regulated in rats fed a CH-rich diet (5Jelinek D.E. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J.

This stimulatory effect provides a regulatory mechanism whereby excess dietary CH can be converted to more polar bile acids for subsequent removal from the body. Although the molecular mechanism is unknown, induction of CYP7A expression in the presence of CH occurs at the level of gene transcription (8Pandak W.M. Li Y.C. Chiang J.Y.L. Studer E.J. Gurley E.C.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). A variety of CH derivatives, including steroid hormones and vitamin D, exert effects on gene expression through interactions with members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6088) Google Scholar). Members of this family function as ligand-activated transcription factors by binding to short stretches of DNA, termed hormone response elements, present in the regulatory regions of target genes. In addition to the nuclear receptors with known ligands, this superfamily includes a large number of structurally related members that contain DNA binding domains and putative ligand binding domains but lack identified ligands, the so-called “orphan receptors.” In this report, we have identified a binding site for the orphan nuclear receptor LXRα in the proximal promoter region of the rat CYP7A gene. LXRα and the closely related orphan receptor LXRβ are broadly expressed and bind to DNA as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (11Apfel R. Benbrook D. Lernhardt E. Ortiz M.A. Salbert G.

As part of an effort to identify natural LXR ligands, we have found that the oxysterols 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol activate both LXRα and LXRβ at concentrations consistent with those found in tissue extracts. Our results provide evidence for a novel oxysterol signaling pathway regulating hepatic CH homeostasis that may also be important in mediating other cellular and developmental effects of CH. 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 24(R),25-epoxycholesterol, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol were prepared as described previously (20Nelson J.A.

Chem. 1985; 260: 14571-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 24-Ketocholesterol was synthesized from cholenic acid by conversion to the Weinreb amide and reaction with isopropyl magnesium chloride. All other compounds were obtained through commercial sources (Sigma; Steraloids). To generate the plasmids pSG5-mLXRα, pSG5-hLXRβ, and pSG5-hRXRα, the cDNAs encoding the murine LXRα, human LXRβ, or human RXRα were inserted into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene). The GAL4-LXR constructs contain in the pSG5 expression vector the translation initiation sequence and amino acids 1-76 of the glucocorticoid receptor fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (amino acids 1-147) and the SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (APKKKRKVG). The cDNAs encoding amino acids 164-447 and 157-440 of the human LXRα and LXRβ were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted C-terminal to the nuclear localization sequence to generate the plasmids pSG5GAL4-hLXRα and pSG5GAL4-hLXRβ, respectively. The reporter plasmids (CYP7-LXRE)4-tk-CAT and (DR-4)4-tk-CAT were generated by inserting four copies of the CYP7-LXRE (5′-gatcCCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAAGTG) or the DR-4-LXRE (5′-gatcCCTTAGTTCACTCAAGTTCAAGTG) into the BamHI restriction site of pBLCAT2 (29Luckow B. Schütz G. Nuclei Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well. In general, transfection mixes contained 33 ng of receptor expression vector, 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 200 ng of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and 166 ng of carrier plasmid. Cells were transfected overnight by lipofection using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% delipidated calf serum (Sigma), and compound was added for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (30Husmann M. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Hermann T. Tzukerman M. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4097-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). LXRα, LXRβ, and RXRα were transcribed and translated in vitro using pSG5-mLXRα, pSG5-hLXRβ, and pSG5-hRXRα as templates and the TNT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Gel mobility shift assays (20 μl) contained 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2.5 μl each of in vitro synthesized LXRα or LXRβ, and RXR proteins. The total amount of reticulocyte lysate was maintained constant in each reaction (5 μl) through the addition of unprogrammed lysate. After a 10-min incubation on ice, 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE = 90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70°C. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (31Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schiebler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In experiments performed with liver nuclear extracts, 5 μg of extract was used, the amount of poly(dI-dC) in each reaction was increased to 8 μg, and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The following double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized and used in the gel mobility assay (sense strand shown, mutated nucleotides underlined): CYP7-LXRE, GATCCCTTTGGTCACTCAAGTTCAAGTGGATC; mCYP7-LXRE, GATCCCTTTGGTCACTCAAGAACAAGTGGATC; and DR-4-LXRE, GATCCCTTAGTTCACTCAAGTTCAAGTGGATC. For the antibody supershift assays, a pool of monoclonal antibodies was used. The antibodies were generated by fusing spleenocytes from an SJL mouse (male, 8 weeks old, Jackson, Bar Harbor, ME) immunized with histidine-tagged recombinant human LXRα protein (amino acids 164-447) with mouse myeloma cells as previously described (32Su J.-L. Becherer J.D. Edwards C. Bukhart W. McGeehan G.M. Champion B.R. Hybridoma. 1995; 14: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Previous work had identified a region of the CYP7A promoter that interacts with nuclear proteins and contains a motif that closely resembles known binding sites for members of the nuclear receptor family (15Hoekman M.F.M. Rientjes J.M.J. Twisk J. Planta R.J. Princen H.M.G. Mager W.H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This putative response element is composed of a nearly perfect tandem repeat of the nuclear receptor half-site recognition sequence AG(G/T)TCA separated by four nucleotides, a so-called DR-4 motif (17Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). This type of DR-4 response element has been shown to function as a high affinity binding site for heterodimers between RXR and the orphan nuclear receptors LXRα and LXRβ (11Apfel R. Benbrook D. Lernhardt E. Ortiz M.A. Salbert G. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7025-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

A. 1995; 92: 2096-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the DR-4 motif in the CYP7A promoter could function as an LXR response element, we performed a series of gel retardation assays. First, to verify that the in vitro synthesized receptor proteins were functional, we used an oligonucleotide in which two nucleotides in the 5′ half-site of the CYP7A direct repeat sequence were mutated to obtain an idealized, tandem repeat of the AGTTCA motif (Fig. 1A, DR4-LXRE). Consistent with previous findings (11Apfel R. Benbrook D. Lernhardt E. Ortiz M.A. Salbert G. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7025-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Willy P.J.

A. 1995; 92: 2096-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), a strong complex was formed when either LXRα or LXRβ was added together with RXR, indicating that high affinity DNA binding required the formation of LXR-RXR heterodimers (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Interestingly, a weaker complex migrating slightly faster than the LXR-RXR heterodimer was observed when LXRα was used in the absence of RXR (Fig. 1B, lane 1), suggesting the weak binding of an LXR homodimeric complex. In experiments performed with an oligonucleotide containing the CYP7A DR-4 element (Fig. 1A), strong binding was observed with both the LXRα-RXR and LXRβ-RXR heterodimers (Fig. 1B, lane 6). This binding was sequence-specific because an excess of either the unlabeled CYP7 oligonucleotide or the idealized DR-4-LXRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-10) competed efficiently for binding to the probe, but no competition for binding was seen with an oligonucleotide in which the 3′ half-site had been mutated to a consensus glucocorticoid receptor half-site (mCYP7-LXRE) (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 11 and 12). As observed with the DR-4-LXRE, a weak and slightly faster migrating complex of a potential LXRα homodimer was seen when LXRα was added alone to the CYP7A direct repeat element (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Based on these data, we refer to the DR-4 of the CYP7A promoter as the CYP7-LXRE. LXRα is abundantly expressed in the liver (11Apfel R. Benbrook D. Lernhardt E. Ortiz M.A. Salbert G. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7025-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), the site of CYP7A expression. To determine whether endogenously expressed LXRα bound to the CYP7-LXRE, we prepared nuclear extracts from rat liver for use in gel retardation assays. A strong, shifted complex was observed in assays performed with the CYP7-LXRE and liver extracts (Fig. 2B, lane 3) that migrated at the same position as the one obtained with in vitro synthesized LXR and RXR protein (Fig. 2B, lane 1). A portion of this complex was supershifted (Fig. 2B, lane 4) upon the addition of a pool of monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognizes the LXRα but not the LXRβ ligand binding domain (Fig. 2A). An analogous supershifted complex was seen in experiments performed with these antibodies and in vitro synthesized LXRα and RXR (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These data show that LXRα is one of the components present in liver extracts that binds to the CYP7-LXRE. The presence of a binding site for LXR in the promoter of the CYP7A gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of CH to bile acids, prompted us to test a comprehensive set of CH precursors and metabolites including bile acids, oxysterols, and steroids for their ability to activate LXRα or LXRβ in cotransfection experiments (Fig. 3A). The compounds were initially tested using chimeric receptor proteins containing the ligand binding domains of either LXRα or LXRβ fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (18Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar). The use of chimeric receptors allowed us to avoid complications in the interpretation of the results caused by endogenous nuclear receptors as well as to identify compounds that mediated their effects through the ligand binding domains of these orphan receptors. Expression plasmids encoding the chimeric receptors were cotransfected into CV-1 cells together with a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the GAL4-binding site upstream of the minimal tk promoter driving the expression of CAT. All compounds were tested on the chimeric receptors at a concentration of 10 μM. As shown in Fig. 3A, neither of the LXR chimeras was activated in response to CH or its precursors lanosterol and desmosterol. Interestingly, however, significant activation of both the LXRα and LXRβ chimeras was observed in transfected cells treated with the oxysterols 20(S)-, 22(R)-, and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 3A). 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol had relatively little or no effect on either LXR chimera (Fig. 3A). Notably, activation of the LXRs was more efficient with the naturally occurring 22(R)- and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol enantiomers than with the synthetic 22(S)- and 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol stereoisomers. We note that while this manuscript was in preparation, several of these oxysterols were shown to activate LXRα (19Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Rama Devi T. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). 24-Keto-cholesterol was also an efficacious activator of both LXRs (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no activation of either LXRα or LXRβ was seen in the presence of additional, downstream intermediates in the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway or in the presence of testosterone or progesterone (Fig. 3A). 7α-Hydroxycholesterol, its bile acid derivatives chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, or bile salts also failed to activate the LXR chimeras (data not shown). In addition, steroids with the 3α-hydroxyl configuration were inactive (data not shown). In addition to the various hydroxycholesterol derivatives, we also examined the activity of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (Fig. 3B). 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol is derived from a shunt in the mevalonate pathway in which squalene epoxide, rather than undergoing cyclization to lanosterol, is instead metabolized to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol (20Nelson J.A. Steckbeck S.R. Spencer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1067-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol has been identified in cultured cells (21Saucier S.E. Kandutsch A.A. Taylaor F.R. Spencer T.A. Phirwa S. Gayen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14571-14579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in tissue homogenates prepared from human and rat livers (22Spencer T.A. Gayen A.K. Phirwa S. Nelson J.A. Taylor F.R. Kandutsch A.A. Erickson S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Spencer T.A. Acc. Chem.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15039-15044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol is derived from a biosynthetic pathway different from that of any of the other oxysterols, it has been proposed that this epoxide might serve as a signaling molecule in the feedback regulation of CH biosynthesis (23Spencer T.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 83-90Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol was an efficacious activator of both LXRs (Fig. 3A). Taken together, the results of these transfecton studies indicate that the optimal structural requirement for LXR activation is a 3β-sterol with an oxygen substituent at C-24 capable of forming a hydrogen bond. We next wished to determine whether the potencies of these oxysterols in the activation of the LXRs were consistent with their known abundance in vivo Three of these compounds are particularly abundant in tissue extracts. 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol is present in brain extracts at concentrations of roughly 100 μM. Although its physiological relevance is not known, these high concentrations have led to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol being termed “cerebrosterol.” Although circulating levels of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol are low in adults (∼50 nM), this concentration can be elevated as much as 10-fold in children (24Lütjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Björkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol has been isolated from human or rat livers at concentrations estimated to be 1-5 μM (22Spencer T.A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 15039-15044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol is present in adrenal extracts at micromolar concentrations. Other oxysterols are present in the circulation or in tissue extracts at concentrations that are nanomolar or lower (25Smith L.L. Johnson B.H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1989; 7: 285-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We performed dose response analysis using expression plasmids for full-length LXRα or LXRβ. Reporter constructs were generated that contained four copies of either the CYP7-LXRE or the idealized DR-4-LXRE driving CAT gene expression. In preliminary experiments performed with 10 μM 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, we found that LXRα induced expression of both the CYP7A-LXRE-CAT and DR-4-LXRE-CAT reporter constructs but that LXRβ only efficiently induced expression of the DR-4-LXRE-CAT reporter construct (data not shown). We speculate that LXRβ may not bind to the CYP7A-LXRE with sufficient affinity to activate reporter expression. Subsequent dose response analyses with LXRα and LXRβ were performed with the CYP7A-LXRE-CAT and DR-4-LXRE-CAT reporter constructs, respectively. LXRα and LXRβ responded to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol with EC50 values of 7.5 and 1.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 4A). 24(R),25-Epoxycholesterol, which has not been found to occur naturally, was significantly less active with an EC greater than 10 μM on both LXRs. 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol had an activation profile similar to that of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol on the LXRs, activating LXRα and LXRβ with EC50 values of 7 and 1.5 μM, respectively (Fig. 4B). The synthetic isomer 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol was at least 1 order of magnitude less active. 20(R)-Hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24-ketocholesterol displayed EC50 values for LXR activation that were greater than 10 μM (data not shown). Based upon these data, we suggest that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, which is abundant in liver, and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is abundant in brain, may function as endogenous activators of LXRα and LXRβ. We note that both LXRs are expressed in the liver. Interestingly, Northern analyses have demonstrated that LXRβ is expressed in the brain (14Teboul M. Enmark E. Li Q. Wikström A.C. Pelto-Huikko M. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2096-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). More detailed in situ studies have shown that LXRβ is broadly expressed in fetal brain and that its expression becomes more restricted in postnatal and adult brains (26Kainu T. Kononen J. Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Peltohuikko M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support the suggestion that 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol may serve in the development and function of the brain via interactions with LXRβ (22Spencer T.A. Gayen A.K. Phirwa S. Nelson J.A. Taylor F.R. Kandutsch A.A. Erickson S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, we have demonstrated that the LXRs are activated by the oxysterols 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol at concentrations consistent with those found in tissues. It is well known that oxysterols suppress de novo CH biosynthesis as well as cellular uptake of CH (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). However, oxysterols have a number of other biological effects including marked effects on DNA synthesis and cell growth and proliferation (25Smith L.L. Johnson B.H. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1989; 7: 285-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that some of these effects may be mediated through the LXRs. It is interesting that the nuclear receptor family member most closely related to the LXRs is the insect ecdysone receptor (12Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 13Song C. Kokontis J.M. Hiipakka R.A. Liao S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ecdysone is a sterol hydroxylated at the 22 and 25 positions that functions as a temporal signal to coordinate tissue-specific morphogenetic changes during insect development (27Thummel C.S. Cell. 1995; 83: 871-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The use of nuclear receptor pathways as a means to transduce the effects of oxygenated sterols thus appears to have been conserved throughout a large part of evolution, from insects to man."
https://openalex.org/W2054054760,The unexpected and prolonged persistence of warm conditions over the tropical Pacific during the early 1990s can be attributed to an interdecadal climate fluctuation that involves changes in the properties of the equatorial thermocline arising as a result of an influx of water with anomalous temperatures from higher latitudes. The influx affects equatorial sea-surface temperatures and hence the tropical and extratropical winds that in turn affect the influx. A simple model demonstrates that these processes can give rise to continual interdecadal oscillations.

These small systems can be considered as prototypical representatives of strong and intermediate-strength hydrogen bonds. The shared proton in the strongly hydrogen bonded H5O2+ behaved in an essentially classical manner, whereas in the H3O2- low-barrier hydrogen bond, quantum zero-point motion played a crucial role even at room temperature. This behavior can be traced back to a small difference in the oxygen-oxygen separation and hence to the strength of the hydrogen bond."
https://openalex.org/W2081203523,The average dipole moment of a water molecule in the condensed phase is enhanced by around 40 percent relative to that of an isolated monomer. This enhancement results from the large polarization caused by the electric field induced by surrounding monomers. A quantitative molecular description of this polarization is essential for modeling aqueous solvation phenomena. This combined theoretical and experimental study of dipole moments in small water clusters provides such a description and also gives insights into the structure of liquid water.

Ad GDNF gene therapy reduced loss of DA neurons approximately threefold 6 weeks after 6-OHDA lesion, as compared with no treatment or injection of Ad lacZ or Ad mGDNF (encoding a biologically inactive deletion mutant GDNF).

A “fluorous synthesis” approach is outlined in which organic molecules are rendered soluble in fluorocarbon solvents by attachment of a suitable fluorocarbon group. Fluorocarbon solvents are usually immiscible in organic solutions, and fluorous molecules partition out of an organic phase and into a fluorous phase in a standard liquid-liquid extraction. Simple yet substantive separations of organic reaction mixtures are achieved without resorting to chromatography. Because fluorous synthesis combines in many respects the favorable purification features of solid-phase synthesis with the favorable reaction, identification, and analysis features of traditional organic synthesis, it should prove valuable in the automated synthesis of libraries of individual pure organic compounds."

Chemical (adenosine triphosphate), electrical, and mechanical stimulation of astrocytes initiated increases in the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ that propagated at ∼23 micrometers per second through astrocytes and Müller cells as intercellular waves. The Ca 2+ waves persisted in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ but were largely abolished by thapsigargin and intracellular heparin, indicating that Ca 2+ was released from intracellular stores. The waves did not evoke changes in cell membrane potential but traveled synchronously in astrocytes and Müller cells, suggesting a functional linkage between these two types of glial cells. Such glial Ca 2+ waves may constitute an extraneuronal signaling pathway in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1993053934,"In Drosophila, the store-operated Ca2+ channel, TRP, is required in photoreceptor cells for a sustained response to light. Here, we show that TRP forms a complex with phospholipase C-beta (NORPA), rhodopsin (RH1), calmodulin, and the PDZ domain containing protein INAD. Proteins with PDZ domains have previously been shown to cluster ion channels in vitro. We show that in InaD mutant flies, TRP is no longer spatially restricted to its normal subcellular compartment, the rhabdomere. These results provide evidence that a PDZ domain protein is required, in vivo, for anchoring of an ion channel to a signaling complex. Furthermore, disruption of this interaction results in retinal degeneration. We propose that the TRP channel is linked to NORPA and RH1 to facilitate feedback regulation of these upstream signaling molecules."

Contrary to this notion, the spatially uniform reduction of electrical coupling induced successful conduction in discontinuous cardiac tissue structures exhibiting unidirectional conduction block. This seemingly paradoxical finding can be explained by a nonsymmetric effect of uncoupling on the current source and the current sink in the preparations used. It suggests that partial cellular uncoupling might prevent the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias that are dependent on the presence of unidirectional conduction block."

The first C2 domain of synaptotagmin I (C2A domain) contains a bipartite Ca2+-binding motif and interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with syntaxin, a central component of the membrane fusion complex. Analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis shows that this interaction is mediated by the cooperative action of basic residues surrounding the Ca2+-binding sites of the C2A domain and is driven by a change in the electrostatic potential of the C2A domain induced by Ca2+ binding. A model is proposed whereby synaptotagmin acts as an electrostatic switch in Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis, promoting a structural rearrangement in the fusion machinery that is effected by its interaction with syntaxin."

Strong exocytosis was then seen only at higher [Ca2+]i (half-maximal at 16 microM). Parallel second messengers did not contribute to GnRH-induced exocytosis, because IP3 alone was as effective as GnRH, and because even GnRH failed to trigger rapid exocytosis when the [Ca2+]i rise was blunted by EGTA. When [Ca2+]i was released from stores, exocytosis depended on [Ca2+]i rising rapidly, as if governed by Ca2+ flux into the cytosol. We suggest that IP3 releases Ca2+ selectively from subsurface cisternae, raising [Ca2+] near exocytic sites 5-fold above the cell average."

To identify potential field changes we have used a functional assay which tests the transcriptional competence of human p53 expressed in yeast. To increase the sensitivity and reliability of the technique for samples containing under 20% mutant p53, the 5′ and 3′-ends of the p53 cDNA were examined separately. With this split form of the assay the tissue p53 mRNA acts as its own control for RNA quality. Mutations were detected in 87% (46/53) of tumours, reflecting the high sensitivity of the technique. Multiple biopsies of histologically normal tissue from the upper aero-digestive tract were tested and clonal p53 mutations were identified in 76% (38/50) of biopsies from patients presenting with multiple tumours compared with 32% (38/117) of biopsies from patients presenting with single tumours (P<0.000001). All patients (16/16) presenting with multiple tumours had at least one positive biopsy, compared with only 53% (19/36) of patients presenting with single tumours (P<0.001). This defines expansion of multiple clones of mutant p53-containing cells as an important biological mechanism of field cancerisation, and provides a means to identify patients likely to benefit from intensive screening for the development of new head and neck tumours."

Based on experimental data, we proposed an extended consensus sequence composed of the two decamers of the El-Deiry consensus sequence flanked by two additional ones. A maximum of 3 bp substitutions was accepted for the two decamers of the El-Deiry consensus sequence, as well as for each additional decamer, except when the two decamers of the El-Deiry consensus sequence are contiguous. In this case, each additional decamer is allowed to bear one base insertion or deletion between the median C and G. This set of criteria was validated by identifying within the promoter region of the IGF-BP3 gene the existence of a novel p53-responsive element whose functional significance was verified. By limiting our computer search to Vertebrate genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cellular adhesion or metastatic processes and to gene families most often found in HOVERGEN database, 7785 gene sequences were first analysed.

https://openalex.org/W2327562877,"FGF-2 has been implicated in the neoplastic transformation of glioma cells and in the transition of normal quiescent astrocytes to a proliferating, reactive state. In the present study we have observed that in human glial cells, levels and subcellular localization of FGF-2 are different in quiescent and proliferating cells. FGF-2 was detected in the cytoplasm of non-reactive astrocytes in human brain sections. In contrast FGF-2 was located within the cytoplasm and nuclei of reactive astrocytes in gliotic brain tissue and in neoplastic cells of glioma tumors. In vitro, FGF-2 was found predominantly in the nucleus of subconfluent proliferating astrocytes, but was detected only in the cytoplasm of density arrested quiescent astrocytes. Our results suggest that reduced cell contact stimulates nuclear accumulation of FGF-2, accompanying mitotic activation of reactive human astrocytes. FGF-2 was constitutively localized to the nucleus of continuously proliferating glioma cells independent of cell density. A role for intracellular FGF-2 was further suggested by the observation that glioma cells that are not stimulated to proliferate by extracellular FGF-2 proliferated faster when transfected with FGF-2 expressing vectors. This increased proliferation correlated with nuclear accumulation of FGF-2. Cell proliferation was attenuated by 5′-deoxy-5′-methylthioadenosine, a FGF-2 receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that acts within the cell, but was unaffected by myo-inositol hexakis [dihydrogen phosphate] that disrupts FGF-2 binding to plasma membrane receptors. Our results indicate that FGF-2 serves as a nuclear regulator of proliferation in astrocytic cells. In glioma cells, the constitutive presence of FGF-2 in the nucleus may promote proliferation that is insensitive to cell contact inhibition."

Several ETS proteins bind to DNA as monomers, however it has been shown that the DNA binding activity is enhanced or modulated in the presence of other factors. By differential display and whole genome PCR techniques, we have recently shown that the Erg1 gene is a target for ETS proteins. The Egr1 promoter contains multiple ETS binding sites, three of which exist as parts of two serum response elements (SREI and SREII). The SRE is a cis-element that regulates the expression of many growth factor responsive genes. ELK1 and SAP1a have been shown to form ternary complexes with SRF on the SRE located in the c-fos promoter. Similarly, we examined whether the ELK1, SAP1a, FLI1, EWS-FLI1, ETS1, ETS2, PEA3 and PU.1 proteins can form ternary complexes with SRF on the Egr1 SREI and II. Our results demonstrate that indeed ELK1, SAP1a, FLI1 and EWS-FLI1 are able to form ternary complexes with SRF on Egr1 SREs. In addition, ELK1 and SAP1a can also form quarternary complexes on the Egr1 SREI. However, the proteins ETS1, ETS2, PEA3 and PU.1 were unable to form ternary complexes with SRF on either the Egr1 or c-fos SREs. Our data demonstrate that FLI1 and EWS-FLI1 constitute new members of a subgroup of ETS proteins that can function as ternary complex factors and further implicate a novel function for these ETS transcription factors in the regulation of the Egr1 gene. By amino acid sequence comparison we found that, in fact, 50% of the amino acids present in the B-box of SAP1a and ELK1, which are required for interaction with SRF, are identical to those present in both FLI1 (amino acids 231 – 248) and EWS-FLI1 proteins. This B-box is not present in ETS1, ETS2, PEA3 or PU.1 and these proteins were unable to form ternary complexes with SRF and Egr1-SREs or c-fos SRE. Furthermore, deletion of 194 amino terminal amino acids of FLI1 did not interfere with its ability to interact with SRF, in fact, this truncation increased the stability of the ternary complex. The FLI1 protein has a unique R-domain located next to the DNA binding region. This R-domain may modulate the interaction with SRF, providing a mechanism that would be unique to FLI1 and EWS-FLI1, thus implicating a novel function for these ETS transcription factors in the regulation of the Egr1 gene."

The channel opens to two states that differ by their conductance and, surprisingly, by their selectivity for two permeant monovalent cations, Na+ and Cs+. The two open states are linked to the closed state via a cyclic gating reaction that proceeds preferentially in one direction under biionic conditions, indicating that the gating mechanism is not at equilibrium. The direction and the magnitude of this gating asymmetry can be accounted for by assuming that ions bound to a site in the permeation pathway influence the gating of this mutant channel, and that in the closed state, the channel site is accessible to internal cations."

To what extent are the dynamics of vesicle recycling subject to modulation? We examined the influence of presynaptic GABAB receptors on vesicle dynamics at single synapses using optical imaging of FM1–43 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The kinetics of FM1–43 destaining indicate that synapses from a single neuron have a unimodal distribution of release probabilities, and GABAB-mediated inhibition occurs uniformly at all sites. Electrical and optical recordings from single cells show that the inhibition of excitatory transmission is entirely accounted for by a rapidly reversible reduction of exocytosis. In contrast, GABAB receptors do not alter the rate or extent of endocytosis."

We observed that in these leukemias, the steady state level of the protein truncated at the COOH terminus was remarkably higher than that of the protein truncated at the NH2-terminus or full length wild-type protein. To examine the rate of proteolysis of different forms of Myb in a uniform cellular background, the proteins were constitutively expressed in the myeloblast cell line M1, using the retrovirus vector LXSN. In pulse chase experiments, using metabolically 35S-labeled proteins, it was determined that COOH-terminal truncation of c-Myb by 248 aa (CT-c-Myb) substantially increases protein stability, resulting in a t1/2 of about 140 min, as compared to 50 min for full length c-Myb (FL-c-Myb). In an investigation of the mechanism involved in the in vivo degradation of this short lived transcription factor, inhibitors of the lysosomal (chloroquine), proteasomal (ALLM, ALLN, lactacystin) and calpains (EGTA, E-64d, BAPTA/AM) pathways were utilized. Results of this experiment identified the 26S proteasome as a major pathway responsible for rapid breakdown of the protein in hematopoietic cells. Further experiments carried out in vitro demonstrated that c-Myb can be ubiquitinated, suggesting that this process may be involved in the targeting of wild-type c-Myb to degradation by the 26S proteasome. In addition, it was demonstrated that CT-c-Myb was less efficiently ubiquitinated than wild-type protein indicating that defects in modification account for its escape from rapid turnover. We speculate that the increased half-life of c-Myb resulting from truncation could contribute to its transforming potential."

Nck is a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein whose function has been enigmatic. We performed confocal microscopy to localize Nck in NIH3T3 and A431 cells. Surprisingly, Nck was identified in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm with no visible change in localization due to PDGF or EGF stimulation. Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytosolic fractions confirmed that there was no translocation in response to growth factor and that tyrosine phosphorylation was specific to only cytosolic Nck. Far Western blot analysis with either Nck, the SH2 domain, or the SH3 domains revealed differential binding in nuclear and cytosolic lysates, indicating specific binding partners for each subcellular location. The major target of c-Src during mitosis is SAM68, a RNA-binding protein ordinarily localized to the nucleus. SAM68 was identified as a nuclear specific binding partner of Nck in both nonmitotic and mitotic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2314327139,"Hox proteins control genetic programs that orchestrate development, and a large subset of Hox proteins can bind DNA elements as heterodimers with the Pbx family of homeodomain proteins. A transcriptionally activated version of Pbx1, E2a-Pbx1, is an oncoprotein in human pre-B cell leukemia that strongly suppresses differentiation and retains its ability to heterodimerize with Hox proteins. Because monomeric Hox proteins bind very similar DNA motifs, it is unclear how they activate diverse developmental programs. Here we demonstrate that heterodimers containing different Hox proteins and a common Pbx1 or E2a-Pbx1 partner bind different DNA motifs. Structural models suggest that the specificity of the Hox protein is altered by a conformation change involving residues in the N-terminal arm of the Hox homeodomain. Mutational analysis also supported the hypothesis that unique sequences in the N-terminal arm of the Hox homeodomain are at least partially responsible for mediating this specificity. In vivo, Hox proteins directed E2a-Pbx1-mediated transactivation with moderate specificity to cognate Hox-Pbx motifs. Thus, the development specificity of individual Hox proteins may be mediated, in part, by differential targeting of cellular genes by Pbx1-Hox complexes. Likewise, through its function as a common heterodimer partner, oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 may be able to interfere with multiple programs of development that are induced by the sequential or simultaneous expression of Hox proteins during hematopoiesis."

We provide evidence that this residue, serine 608 of pRB, is an authentic phosphorylation site that can be phosphorylated in vitro by cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin D1-CDK4 kinases but not by cyclin E-CDK2 kinase or the mitogen activated kinase ERK2. Phosphorylation at this residue seems to be cell cycle regulated, occurring prior to entry into the S phase."

https://openalex.org/W2092186656,"Self-splicing group I introns, like other large catalytic RNAs, contain structural domains. Although the crystal structure of one of these domains has been determined by x-ray analysis, its connection to the other major domain that contains the guanosine-binding site has not been known. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of RNA splicing were used to identify a base triple in the conserved core of both a cyanobacterial ( Anabaena ) and a eukaryotic ( Tetrahymena ) group I intron. This long-range interaction connects a sequence adjacent to the guanosine-binding site with the domain implicated in coordinating the 5′ splice site helix, and it thereby contributes to formation of the active site. The resulting five-strand junction, in which a short helix forms base triples with three separate strands in the Tetrahymena intron, reveals exceptionally dense packing of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2039997181,"Interaction between the TATA box-binding protein TBP and TFIIB is critical for transcription in vitro. An altered-specificity TBP-TFIIB interaction was rationally designed and linked in sequence to an altered-specificity TATA box-TBP interaction to study how TBP and TFIIB function together to support transcription in human cells. The activity of this altered-specificity TATA-TBP-TFIIB array demonstrated that many activators use the known TBP-TFIIB interaction to stimulate transcription. One activator, however, derived from a glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1, activated transcription independently of this interaction. These results reveal that selectivity in activator function in vivo can be achieved through differential use of TBP and TFIIB."

https://openalex.org/W2000048828,"A new ribosomal RNA promoter element with a functional role similar to the RNA polymerase II initiator (Inr) was identified. This sequence, which we dub the ribosomal Inr (rInr) is unusually conserved, even in normally divergent RNA polymerase I promoters. It functions in the recruitment of the fundamental, TATA-binding protein (TBP)-containing transcription factor, TIF-IB. All upstream elements of the exceptionally strong <i>Acanthamoeba castellanii</i> ribosomal RNA core promoter, to within 6 base pairs of the transcription initiation site (<i>tis</i>), can be deleted without loss of specific transcription initiation. Thus, the <i>A. castellanii</i> promoter can function in a manner similar to RNA polymerase II TATA-less promoters. Sequence-specific photo-cross-linking localizes a 96-kDa subunit of TIF-IB and the second largest RNA polymerase I subunit (A<sup>133</sup>) to the rInr sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2313485156,"The α platelet derived growth factor receptor (αPDGFR) extracellular Immunoglobulin (Ig) like domains 1 – 3 contain major determinants for ligand interaction. We now report that a deletion of Ig-like loop 3, but not Ig-like loop 1 or 2, of the αPDGFR causes ligand-independent transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Biochemical analyses of αPDGFR mutants lacking Ig-like loop 3 indicate that cellular transformation is mediated by ligand-independent activation of the αPDGFR tyrosine kinase activity as determined by receptor autophosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, cross-linking analysis of αPDGFR mutants expressed ectopically in NIH3T3 cells indicate that deletion within extracellular domain 3 leads to ligand-independent receptor dimerization. All of these findings suggest that the Ig-like loop 3 of the αPDGFR contains the major determinants which inhibit receptor dimerization in the quiescent cells and that the ligand binding induces receptor activation by neutralizing the inhibitory effect of this domain."

Ectopic expression of myo-bHLH regulators transdetermines some fibroblast cell lines into myoblasts, which exit the cell cycle and differentiate into skeletal muscle when cultured in low mitogen medium. While members of the myo-bHLH family have been shown to function as transcriptional activators in differentiating muscle, the molecular basis of their function in proliferating myoblasts has not been elucidated. In this report, we present evidence that MyoD functions as a transcriptional repressor in myoblasts.

The myo-bHLH regulators appear to perform two functions in myogenic cells: conferral and maintenance of the myogenic phenotype in proliferating myoblasts and activation of muscle gene transcription in differentiated muscle cells. Activation of muscle gene transcription by myo-bHLH regulators has been well studied and is contingent on the removal or depletion of mitogenic stimuli and withdrawal from the cell cycle (15Konigsberg I.W.

Inhibition of muscle gene transcription by these mitogens involves redundant mechanisms that include sequestering of E proteins by protein Id (20Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) and binding of certain members of the Jun family (21Bengal E. Ransone L. Scharfmann R. Dwarki V.J.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 676-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Inhibition of myo-bHLH regulators by bFGF also may involve redundant mechanisms. Stimulation of protein kinase C by bFGF may block the activity of some myogenic bHLH regulators through phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in the basic regions of these proteins (23Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Treatment of myoblasts with bFGF also has been shown to stimulate expression of cyclin D1 (24Rao S.S. Kohtz D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4093-4100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-dependent kinase activity inhibits the activity of the myo-bHLH regulators through a mechanism that may involve phosphorylation of sites in the activation domains of these proteins 2C.

Although activation of most muscle-specific genes by the myo-bHLH regulators is blocked in myoblasts, autoactivation of transcription from the myo-bHLH regulator genes is not inhibited. The mechanisms of transcriptional activation of the myo-bHLH genes are not well understood, and the role of MyoD in autoactivation may involve an indirect mechanism. Indeed, recent evidence has suggested that direct binding of myo-bHLH regulators to the upstream regions of these genes is not required for autoactivation (27Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional complexes of the B-type cyclins and p34CDC2/CDK1 are necessary for entry into and progression through mitosis (28Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 29Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). Two B-type cyclins (B1 and B2) have been identified in mammals (31Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) that differ in subcellular distribution (32Jackman M. Firth M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1646-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Accumulation of B-type cyclins and cyclin B-p34CDC2/CDK1 kinase activity during the G2, G2/M, and M phases of the cell cycle is regulated by several mechanisms. Proteolysis of B-type cyclins in late M phase occurs after ubiquitination (33Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar), and the subcellular location of B-type cyclins also changes dramatically during different phases of the cell cycle. In addition, transcription of B-type genes is strongly induced during late S and G2 phases (31Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The structure and sequence of the cyclin B1 promoter has been described (34Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell.

Two consensus binding sites for MyoD and one for products of the E2A gene were identified upstream of a basal promoter (36Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Since the cyclin B1 gene is active in proliferating rather than terminally differentiated cells, this promoter presented an opportunity to study the effects of MyoD on gene transcription in proliferating myoblasts. In this report, we show that the paired MyoD binding sites in the cyclin B1 promoter mediate repression of cyclin B1 gene transcription in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts. Ectopic expression of MyoD in proliferating C3H10T1/2 cells also repressed the cyclin B1 reporter. Evidence that both MyoD binding sites function in concert to mediate repression is presented. These results reveal a novel function for MyoD in proliferating myoblasts as a specific transcriptional repressor. Deletion mutant constructs, pCycB1(−3800)-CAT, pCycB1(−1050)-CAT, pCycB1(−290)-CAT, and pCycB1(−290 USF Mut)-CAT have been described previously (34Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). pCycB1(−318)-CAT and pCycB1(−169)-CAT were made by deleting fragments between StuI sites at −318 or −169 and the polylinker HindIII site of pCycB1(−1050)-CAT. pCycB1(−224)-CAT was generated by deleting the PstI-PstI fragment from pCycB1(−1050)-CAT. pCycB1(−127)-CAT was created by subcloning the XmnI to XbaI fragment of pCycB1(−1050)-CAT into SmaI-XbaI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). Then, the fragment was excised with HindIII and XbaI and cloned into respective sites of pCAT-Basic (Promega). Site mutant construct, pCycB1(−290 MyoD 5′ Mut)-CAT was made by engineering a MluI site at the 5′ MyoD binding sequence. pCycB1(−290 MyoD 3′ Mut)-CAT was also made by engineering an EcoRI site at the 3′ MyoD binding sequence. pCycB1(−290 MyoD [5′+ 3′] Mut)-CAT was generated by engineering both MluI and EcoRI sites at the 5′ and 3′ MyoD binding sites. pRSV-CAT (39Gorman C.M.

C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to 50% confluency and transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitate protocol (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 18 h with the precipitate, new medium was added, and cells were harvested for CAT activity 16 h later. CAT assays were performed as described (42Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Equal protein levels were determined by the Bradford assay. CAT activities were quantitated by phosphorimage analysis of thin layer chromatography plates. Baseline activity of pCAT-Basic was determined from transfections with pCAT-Basic and pEMSV-α2. One hundred percent activity was determined from transfections with either pCycB1(−318)-CAT or pCycB1(−290)-CAT and pEMSV-MyoD. The values were normalized to parallel transient expression assays performed with a Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat expression construct (pRSV-CAT). The cyclin B1 minimal promoter has recently been identified, and analysis of its sequence has revealed consensus binding sites for several transcriptional regulators upstream of the transcription initiation site (34Cogswell J.P.

A series of deletion mutants of the cyclin B1 promoter (−3800, −1050, −318, −224, −169, and −127; Fig. 1B) were assayed for activity as CAT reporter constructs in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts (the promoter displayed only low level activity in differentiated myotubes; data not shown). Of these constructs, pCycB1(−224)-CAT displayed the greatest transcriptional activity. The activity of pCycB1(−169)-CAT and pCycB1(−127)-CAT was significantly less than that of pCycB1(−224)-CAT, due to the loss of an essential USF binding site (Fig. 1B; Refs. 34Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 53Lemaigre F.P. Courtois S.J. Lafontaine D.A. Rousseau G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, retention of the pair of MyoD binding sites in constructs pCycB1(−318)-CAT, pCycB1(−1050)-CAT, and pCycB1(−3800)-CAT resulted in repression of transcription in comparison to pCycB1(−224)-CAT. Since it is expressed at significant levels in C2C12 myoblasts (8Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar), this result suggested to us that MyoD may mediate transcriptional repression of certain genes in proliferating myoblasts. We next asked whether the MyoD binding sites specifically mediate repression of the pCycB1-CAT constructs, and whether both sites or a single site are required for this function. Single-base mutants eliminating the left (pCycB1(−290 5′ MyoDmut)-CAT), right (pCycB1(−290 3′ MyoDmut)-CAT), or both (pCycB1(−290 [5′+ 3′] MyoDmut)-CAT) MyoD binding sites were tested for expression in C2C12 myoblasts. Expression was compared to that of a wild-type construct (pCycB1(−290)-CAT) spanning the same promoter region (this construct contains the paired MyoD binding sites; Fig. 2A). Expression of all three mutant reporter constructs greatly exceeded that of the wild-type construct (Fig. 2B). Thus, mutation of either MyoD binding site abolishes repression of the pCycB1-CAT reporters in proliferating myoblasts. This result strongly suggests that binding to these sites is required for repression. Interestingly, disruption of either site blocked repression, indicating that repression requires binding to both sites. We next asked whether repression of transcription from the pCycB1-CAT reporters is mediated by MyoD expression. The mouse fibroblast cell line C3H10T1/2 was transfected with pCycB1(−127)-CAT, pCycB1(−169)-CAT, pCycB1(−224)-CAT, and pCycB1(−318)-CAT either with or without a MyoD expression construct (pEMSV-MyoD). The transient expression assays were performed with C3H10T1/2 cells under mitogenic conditions (subconfluence in high serum medium). Under these conditions, activation of muscle gene transcription by ectopic MyoD is inhibited as it is in myoblasts cultured similarly. Expression of pCycB1(−127)-CAT, pCycB1(−169)-CAT, and pCycB1(−224)-CAT in proliferating C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts was either unaffected or stimulated by ectopic expression of MyoD (Fig. 3). In contrast, ectopic expression of MyoD inhibited expression of pCycB1(−318)-CAT, consistent with the presence of the paired MyoD binding sites on this construct. This result shows that MyoD can directly mediate repression of the minimal cyclin B1 reporter through interaction with the paired binding sites present in pCycB1(−318)-CAT. Interestingly, repression of pCycB1(−318)-CAT by ectopic expression of MyoD was not observed in CV-1 cells (data not shown), which are resistant to myogenic conversion (58Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The role of the paired MyoD binding site in mediating repression by MyoD was further investigated by transient expression assays of pCycB1(−290)-CAT site mutants in proliferating C3H10T1/2 cells. Ectopic expression of MyoD repressed pCycB1(−290)-CAT in proliferating C3H10T1/2 cells only when both binding sites were intact (Fig. 4). Indeed, disruption of the right (3′) or both binding sites resulted in stimulation of pCycB1(−290)-CAT by ectopic expression of MyoD (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with those obtained using the same mutants in C2C12 myoblasts and emphasize the functional importance of both binding sites in mediating repression by MyoD. Disruption of other E-box sequences (including the USF site) in the pCycB1-CAT constructs does not affect repression (data not shown). The possibility that E-box binding proteins may function as transcriptional repressors has been suggested by studies of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) enhancer. The activity of a bHLH protein (TFE3) that binds a μE3 site in the IgH enhancer is repressed by binding of another factor to an adjacent μE5 site (59Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Displacement of the repressor factor by another μE5-binding protein (ITF-1) has been shown to mediate activation of the IgH enhancer (59Ruezinsky D. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The IgH enhancer contains E-box sequences that can bind MyoD; however, binding of MyoD to these sites does activate transcription (36Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 60Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). Repression of transcriptional activation of the IgH enhancer by MyoD is also dependent on an adjacent μE5 site; removal of this site allows MyoD to activate transcription from the mutant enhancer (61Weintraub H. Genetta T. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2203-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The protein(s) binding μE5 site(s) in the IgH enhancer and repressing transcriptional activation by adjacent E-box binding proteins have not been characterized as yet. Nonetheless, a functional parallel may be drawn to repression of the cyclin B1 promoter by MyoD, which may result from repression of transcriptional activation by USF. In support of this possibility, specific binding of the cyclin B1 promoter by USF has been shown to be required for transcriptional activation (34Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although ectopic expression of MyoD in fibroblasts can induce autoactivation of the endogenous MyoD gene and activate expression of other myo-bHLH regulators, the molecular basis of these events is not clear. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays suggest that MyoD maintains significant sequence-specific DNA binding activity in myoblasts (36Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 38Weintraub H. Dwarki V.J. Verma I. Davis R. Hollenberg S. Snider L. Lassar A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 62Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of muscle gene transcription by all of the myo-bHLH regulators is restricted to mitogenically arrested cells. Repression of the transcriptional activity of the myo-bHLH regulators in proliferating cells has been well studied (63Lassar A.B. Skapek S.X. Novitch B. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and recent studies of autoactivation of the MyoD gene in myoblasts have supported an indirect mechanism (27Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of MyoD to its own promoter is not required for autoactivation in myoblasts, consistent with its lack of transcriptional activity in mitogenically active cells. As shown here, the repressor activity of MyoD is functional in proliferating myoblasts. From this observation, an indirect mechanism of autoactivation can be proposed in which the expression of a repressor of MyoD gene transcription is itself repressed by MyoD. Understanding the role of MyoD in regulating expression of the cyclin B1 gene during the cell cycle will require further investigation. Similar to activation of the IgH enhancer by TFE3 described above, activation of the cyclin B1 gene by USF and/or downstream elements may require displacement of MyoD by another factor. The activity and/or expression of the displacing factor may be restricted to the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle, when expression of the cyclin B1 gene is maximal. Recent studies by Hwang et al. (35Hwang A. Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have suggested that binding of inhibitory protein(s) to a region −90 to +1 of the cyclin B1 promoter represses transcription during late G1. In addition, their studies show that repression of the cyclin B1 promoter during G1 is mediated by a region between −207 and −872, which we show here contains the binding sites that confer repression by MyoD. It is possible that in other cell types functionally analogous repressor proteins are expressed that bind the same E-box sites as MyoD in the cyclin B1 promoter. Experiments are in progress to test this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2326673060,"We have recently demonstrated that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 7q31 is frequent in many kinds of human primary tumors and that introducing a single human chromosome (hchr) 7 into a murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-derived cell line suppresses the malignant phenotype. To investigate whether the putative tumor suppressor gene on hchr 7 is conserved in mice, we studied LOH on mouse chromosome (mchr) 6 in chemically induced SCCs in (C57BL×DBA2) F1 (B6D2F1) females. LOH analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of 17 (CA)n microsatellite repeats in mchr 6 A1-C3. As expected, all the B6D2F1-derived tumors were informative for all the locus assayed. The highest percentage of LOH in the hchr 7q-homologous segment was found at D6Mit50 (60.0%) and the other markers in this segment had LOH incidences normally distributed around the peak. The high incidence of LOH in the tumors studied suggests that a tumor suppressor gene relevant to the development of epithelial cancers is present on mchr 6 A2. As this segment is homologous with hchr 7q31, these data suggest that the putative tumor suppressor gene is conserved in the two species and explains the suppression of tumorigenicity when a single hchr 7 is introduced to a murine SCC cell line."
