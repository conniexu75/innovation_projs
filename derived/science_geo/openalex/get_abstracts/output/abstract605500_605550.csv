https://openalex.org/W2790164653,"Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In recent years, India has reported increased incidences of concurrent infection with multiple serotypes of dengue viruses (DENV). In the present study, we have characterized DENV circulating during a single season of 2016 in Pune, India. A total of 64 serum samples from NS1 ELISA positive dengue patients were used for PCR amplification of CprM region of the viral genome and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis documented circulation of all the four DENV serotypes with predominance of DENV-2 (40.6%). DENV genotyping classified DENV-1 to Genotype V, DENV-2 to Genotype IV, DENV-3 to Genotype III and DENV-4 to Genotype I. Further analysis revealed emergence of a novel clade (D) of genotype I of DENV-4. Subsequent isolation of three DENV-4 viruses in cell culture followed by complete genome sequence analysis confirmed this observation. Additionally, a new genotype within serotype-4 with >6.7% sequence variation from other genotypes was identified. This first report of significant co-circulation of all the four serotypes in a single outbreak in Pune reconfirms need for molecular monitoring of DENV."
https://openalex.org/W2791821920,"Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are assumed to be among the main agents that cause severe mastitis disease with clinical signs in dairy cattle. Rapid detection of this disease is so important in order to prevent transmission to other cows and helps to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics. With the rapid progress in high-throughput technologies, and accumulation of various kinds of '-omics' data in public repositories, there is an opportunity to retrieve, integrate, and reanalyze these resources to improve the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases and to provide mechanistic insights into host resistance in an efficient way. Meta-analysis is a relatively inexpensive option with good potential to increase the statistical power and generalizability of single-study analysis. In the current meta-analysis research, six microarray-based studies that investigate the transcriptome profile of mammary gland tissue after induced mastitis by E. coli infection were used. This meta-analysis not only reinforced the findings in individual studies, but also several novel terms including responses to hypoxia, response to drug, anti-apoptosis and positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter enriched by up-regulated genes. Finally, in order to identify the small sets of genes that are sufficiently informative in E. coli mastitis, the differentially expressed gene introduced by meta-analysis were prioritized by using ten different attribute weighting algorithms. Twelve meta-genes were detected by the majority of attribute weighting algorithms (with weight above 0.7) as most informative genes including CXCL8 (IL8), NFKBIZ, HP, ZC3H12A, PDE4B, CASP4, CXCL2, CCL20, GRO1(CXCL1), CFB, S100A9, and S100A8. Interestingly, the results have been demonstrated that all of these genes are the key genes in the immune response, inflammation or mastitis. The Decision tree models efficiently discovered the best combination of the meta-genes as bio-signature and confirmed that some of the top-ranked genes -ZC3H12A, CXCL2, GRO, CFB- as biomarkers for E. coli mastitis (with the accuracy 83% in average). This research properly indicated that by combination of two novel data mining tools, meta-analysis and machine learning, increased power to detect most informative genes that can help to improve the diagnosis and treatment strategies for E. coli associated with mastitis in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2793314289,"Aging is an important risk factor for most chronic diseases. Patients with COPD develop more comorbidities than non-COPD subjects. We hypothesized that the development of comorbidities characteristically affecting the elderly occur at an earlier age in subjects with the diagnosis of COPD.We included all subjects carrying the diagnosis of COPD (n = 27,617), and a similar number of age and sex matched individuals without the diagnosis, extracted from the 727,241 records of individuals 40 years and older included in the EpiChron Cohort (Aragon, Spain). We compared the cumulative number of comorbidities, their prevalence and the mortality risk between both groups. Using network analysis, we explored the connectivity between comorbidities and the most influential comorbidities in both groups. We divided the groups into 5 incremental age categories and compared their comorbidity networks. We then selected those comorbidities known to affect primarily the elderly and compared their prevalence across the 5 age groups. In addition, we replicated the analysis in the smokers' subgroup to correct for the confounding effect of cigarette smoking. Subjects with COPD had more comorbidities and died at a younger age compared to controls. Comparison of both cohorts across 5 incremental age groups showed that the number of comorbidities, the prevalence of diseases characteristic of aging and network's density for the COPD group aged 56-65 were similar to those of non-COPD 15 to 20 years older. The findings persisted after adjusting for smoking.Multimorbidity increases with age but in patients carrying the diagnosis of COPD, these comorbidities are seen at an earlier age."
https://openalex.org/W2792337949,"The incidence of nosocomial infections from extensively drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDR-PA) has been increasing worldwide. We investigated the prevalence and factors associated with XDR-PA infections, including the factors that predict mortality.We retrospectively studied a cohort of adult, hospitalized patients with P. aeruginosa (PA) infections between April and December 2014.Of the 255 patients with PA infections, 56 (22%) were due to XDR-PA, 32 (12.5%) to multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA), and 167 (65.5%) to non-MDR PA. Receiving total parenteral nutrition (adjusted OR [aOR] 6.21; 95% CI 1.05-36.70), prior carbapenem use (aOR 4.88; 95% CI 2.36-10.08), and prior fluoroquinolone use (aOR 3.38; 95% CI 1.44-7.97) were independently associated with the XDR-PA infections. All XDR-PA remained susceptible to colistin. Factors associated with mortality attributable to the infections were the presence of sepsis/septic shock (aOR 11.60; 95% CI 4.66-28.82), admission to a medical department (aOR 4.67; 95% CI 1.81-12.06), receiving a central venous catheter (aOR 3.78; 95% CI 1.50-9.57), and XDR-PA infection (aOR 2.73; 95% CI 1.05-7.08).The prevalence of XDR-PA infections represented almost a quarter of Pseudomonas aeruginosa hospital-acquired infections and rendered a higher mortality. The prompt administration of an appropriate empirical antibiotic should be considered when an XDR-PA infection is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2790218132,"Suicide is a serious cause of mortality worldwide and is considered as a psychiatric emergency. People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have higher rates of suicidal behavior than the general population. This study assessed the prevalence and verified the syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions on suicidal ideation among PLWHA in China.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from July to August 2016 in Nanjing, China, using a self-report questionnaire. Sociodemographic characteristics, infection status, psychosocial variables and suicide ideation reports of participants were collected. Logistic regressions were used to identify potential factors associated with suicidal ideation and to verify the syndemic effect of psychosocial factors. Additionally, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed.In total, four hundred sixty-five PLWHA participated, 31.6% (n = 147) of whom had suicidal ideation. The results from univariate analysis showed that older age, low education level, being married, having children, and psychosocial variables (high perceived stigma, depression, low self-esteem, social support and resilience) were significantly associated with increased suicidal ideation. Multiple logistic regression models revealed that depression (OR = 2.70, 95%CI = 1.62-4.51), perceived stigma (OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.17-3.32), and low social support (OR = 1.85, 95%CI = 1.08-3.20) and self-esteem (OR = 4.11, 95%CI = 2.06-8.16) were statistically significant. PLWHA with at least two psychosocial health problems were nearly 5 times more likely (OR = 4.72, 95% CI 3.11-7.17) to have had suicidal ideation.Suicidal ideation is frequent among PLWHA in China and is consistent with prevalence estimates from abroad. Psychosocial health problems were the determining factors associated with suicidal ideation, and a syndemic effect of psychosocial health conditions was confirmed in predicting suicidal ideation. Therefore, early screening of high-risk groups for suicidal ideation and more psychosocial health care among PLWHA are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2790479116,"Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving clinical treatment but it can induce or aggravate lung injury. New therapeutic strategies, aimed at reducing the negative effects of mechanical ventilation such as excessive production of reactive oxygen species, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and transmigration as well as activation of neutrophil cells, are needed to improve the clinical outcome of ventilated patients. Though the inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane is known to exert organ-protective effects, little is known about the potential of sevoflurane therapy in ventilator-induced lung injury. This study focused on the effects of delayed sevoflurane application in mechanically ventilated C57BL/6N mice. Lung function, lung injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory parameters were analyzed and compared between non-ventilated and ventilated groups with or without sevoflurane anesthesia. Mechanical ventilation led to a substantial induction of lung injury, reactive oxygen species production, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and neutrophil influx. In contrast, sevoflurane posttreatment time dependently reduced histological signs of lung injury. Most interestingly, increased production of reactive oxygen species was clearly inhibited in all sevoflurane posttreatment groups. Likewise, the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and MIP-1β and neutrophil transmigration were completely prevented by sevoflurane independent of the onset of sevoflurane administration. In conclusion, sevoflurane posttreatment time dependently limits lung injury, and oxidative and pro-inflammatory responses are clearly prevented by sevoflurane irrespective of the onset of posttreatment. These findings underline the therapeutic potential of sevoflurane treatment in ventilator-induced lung injury."
https://openalex.org/W2790643307,"We hypothesized that diabetes during pregnancy (DDP) alters genome-wide DNA methylation in placenta resulting in differentially methylated loci of metabolically relevant genes and downstream changes in RNA and protein expression.We mapped genome-wide DNA methylation with the Infinium 450K Human Methylation Bead Chip in term fetal placentae from Native American and Hispanic women with DDP using a nested case-control design (n = 17 pairs). RNA expression and protein levels were assayed via RNA-Seq and Western Blot.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed 465 CpG sites with significant changes for male offspring, 247 for female offspring, and 277 for offspring of both sexes (p<0.001). Placentae from female offspring were 40% more likely to have significant gains in DNA methylation compared with placentae from male offspring exposed to DDP (p<0.001). Changes in DNA methylation corresponded to changes in RNA and protein levels for 6 genes: PIWIL3, CYBA, GSTM1, GSTM5, KCNE1 and NXN. Differential DNA methylation was detected at loci related to mitochondrial function, DNA repair, inflammation, oxidative stress.These findings begin to explain mechanisms responsible for the increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes in offspring of mothers with DDP."
https://openalex.org/W2792607838,"We present a general strategy for the modeling and simulation-based control of soft robots. Although the presented methodology is completely general, we restrict ourselves to the analysis of a model robot made of hyperelastic materials and actuated by cables or tendons. To comply with the stringent real-time constraints imposed by control algorithms, a reduced-order modeling strategy is proposed that allows to minimize the amount of online CPU cost. Instead, an offline training procedure is proposed that allows to determine a sort of response surface that characterizes the response of the robot. Contrarily to existing strategies, the proposed methodology allows for a fully non-linear modeling of the soft material in a hyperelastic setting as well as a fully non-linear kinematic description of the movement without any restriction nor simplifying assumption. Examples of different configurations of the robot were analyzed that show the appeal of the method."
https://openalex.org/W2792353077,"Introduction The risk of development of active TB in HIV-infected individuals is 20–37 times higher than those that are HIV negative. Poor knowledge of TB amongst people living with HIV has been associated with high transmission. Objectives To determine the effectiveness of a new health education intervention module in improving knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding tuberculosis among HIV patients in General Hospital Minna, Nigeria. Methods A randomized control trial was carried out from July 2015 to June 2017. A random number generating program was used to allocate 226 respondents into 2 groups. The intervention group received health education regarding tuberculosis using the developed module. The control group received the normal services provided for HIV patients. Data were collected from December 2015 to September 2016 at baseline, immediate post intervention, three, six and nine months. The outcome measures were knowledge, attitude, and practice. Results There was no significant difference with respect to socio-demographic characteristics, KAP of the respondents in the intervention and control group at baseline. However, there was significant improvement in knowledge in the intervention group compared to the control group, group main effect (F = (1,218) = 665.889, p = 0.001, partial ἠ2 = 0.753, d = 5.4); time (F = (3.605, 218) = 52.046, p = 0.001, partial ἠ2 = 0.193, d = 1.52) and interaction between group with time (F = (3.605, 218) = 34.028, p = 0.001, partial ἠ2 = 0.135, d = 1.23). Likewise, there was significant improvement in attitude, group main effect (p = 0.001, d = 1.26) and time (p = 0.001, p, d = 0.65). Similarly, there was improvement in practice, group main effect, time, and interaction of group with time (p < 0.05). Conclusion The health education intervention program was effective in improving KAP regarding tuberculosis among HIV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2790706156,"RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 5′/3′ nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2790920739,"Children and adolescents continue to have HIV/AIDS in southern Saharan Africa. Scaling up of HIV services has significantly improved access to ARV and consequently improved on morbidity and mortality related to HIV/AIDS including opportunistic infection. Despite the above efforts, non-communicable conditions including mental disorders such as depression have been observed to contribute to the burden of disabilities about which little is documented. This study, therefore, aimed to determine the magnitude of depressive symptoms and the associated factors among HIV-infected children and adolescents.The study was a matched case-control design involving 300 cases of HIV-infected children matched by age and sex against 600 uninfected controls. Systematic sampling technique was used to select the cases while multistage sampling technique was employed to identify villages/ streets purposive and sampling technique was employed to obtain participants from households.The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms among the cohort of 900 participants was found to be 12.9%, with 27% of HIV-infected and 5.8% of HIV-uninfected children and adolescents screened positive for depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression revealed that being HIV-infected (AOR 1.96(1.11-3.45)), residing in a rural setting (AOR 0.61(0.39-0.96)) and history of childhood deprivation (AOR 4.76 (2.79-8.13)) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms.HIV infected adolescents are more affected by depression compared to non-infected counterparts. Childhood deprivation was significantly associated with presence of depressive symptoms. Integration of mental health evaluation and treatment into the HIV care provided for adolescents can be beneficial. More studies to delineate factors associated with depressed adolescents with HIV may add value to the body of knowledge and overall improvement of care."
https://openalex.org/W2788970060,"Background Suicidal behaviour remains challenging for clinicians to predict, with few established risk factors and warning signs among psychiatric patients. Aim We aimed to describe characteristics and identify risk factors for suicide attempts among patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for clinically important confounders, was employed to determine risk factors for suicide attempts within a psychiatric patient population. Results The case (n = 146) and control groups (n = 104) did not differ significantly with regards to sociodemographic characteristics. The majority of the participants who had attempted suicide did so with high intent to die, and expected to die without medical intervention. The primary method of attempt was pharmaceutical overdose among the case participants (73.3%). Results showed impulsivity (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.30) and borderline personality symptoms (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01–1.13) were significantly associated with attempted suicide. Conclusions Our findings indicate that known sociodemographic risk factors for suicide may not apply within psychiatric populations. Prevention strategies for suicidal behaviour in psychiatric patients may be effective, including limited access to means for suicide attempts (i.e. excess pharmaceutical drugs) and target screening for high-risk personality and impulsivity traits."
https://openalex.org/W2793712647,"Between 2011 and 2014 outbreaks of septicaemia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae subspecies pneumoniae (Kpp) were diagnosed on thirteen English pig farms. The most consistent features were rapid deaths of pigs from ten-days-old to weaning, seasonal occurrence (May to September), affected farms being outdoor breeding herds and the location of all but one of the outbreaks in the East Anglia region in Eastern England. Molecular characterisation of the outbreak Kpp isolates showed that by multilocus sequencing all were sequence type 25 (ST25) of K2 capsular type with a combination of a 4.3kb plasmid (pKPMC25), three phage sequences and the rmpA virulence gene. No archived Kpp isolates of porcine origin pre-dating 2011 were identified as ST25. In 2013 there was the first detection of an outbreak Kpp isolate showing antimicrobial resistance to six antibiotics. Human infection with Kpp ST25 has not been reported in the UK."
https://openalex.org/W2791317284,"Laparoscopy has been used for the diagnosis and treatment for hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating abdominal trauma. This study evaluated whether diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy can be used as effectively in select patients with blunt abdominal trauma. All hemodynamically stable patients undergoing operations for blunt abdominal trauma over a 10-year period (2006-2015) at a tertiary medical center were included. Patients undergoing laparotomy were categorized as group A. Patients who underwent laparoscopy were categorized as group B. The clinical outcomes of the 2 groups were compared. There were 139 patients in group A and 126 patients in group B. Group A patients were more severely injured (mean injury severity score of 23.3 vs. 18.9, P < .001) and had a higher frequency of traumatic brain injuries (25.2% vs. 14.3%, P = .039). The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic laparoscopy for patients in group B was 99.1% and 100.0%, respectively. No non-therapeutic laparotomies were performed in group B, and the success rate of therapeutic laparoscopy was 92.0% (103/112) for patients with significant intra-abdominal injuries. Patients in the 2 groups had similar perioperative and postoperative outcomes in terms of operation times, blood loss, blood transfusion requirements, mortality, and complications (all, P > .05). Laparoscopy is a feasible and safe tool for the diagnosis and treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma who require surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2792713057,"Revertant mosaicism, or “natural gene therapy”, is the phenomenon in which germline mutations are corrected by somatic events. In recent years, revertant mosaicism has been identified in all major types of epidermolysis bullosa, the group of heritable blistering disorders caused by mutations in the genes encoding epidermal adhesion proteins. Moreover, revertant mosaicism appears to be present in all patients with a specific subtype of recessive epidermolysis bullosa. We therefore hypothesized that revertant mosaicism should be expected at least in all patients with recessive forms of epidermolysis bullosa. Naturally corrected, patient-own cells are of extreme interest for their promising therapeutic potential, and their presence in all patients would open exciting, new treatment perspectives to those patients. To test our hypothesis, we determined the probability that single nucleotide reversions occur in patients’ skin using a mathematical developmental model. According to our model, reverse mutations are expected to occur frequently (estimated 216x) in each patient’s skin. Reverse mutations should, however, occur early in embryogenesis to be able to drive the emergence of recognizable revertant patches, which is expected to occur in only one per ~10,000 patients. This underestimate, compared to our clinical observations, can be explained by the “late-but-fitter revertant cell” hypothesis: reverse mutations arise at later stages of development, but provide revertant cells with a selective growth advantage in vivo that drives the development of recognizable healthy skin patches. Our results can be extrapolated to any other organ with stem cell division numbers comparable to skin, which may offer novel future therapeutic options for other genetic conditions if these revertant cells can be identified and isolated."
https://openalex.org/W2794171340,"Objectives To assess the use of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) to verify, and if necessary, optimize the cochlear implant (CI) fitting of adult CI users with postlingual single-sided deafness (SSD). Methods Sound field cortical responses to the speech tokens /m/, /g/, /t/, and /s/ were recorded from input to the CI while the normal hearing ear was masked. Responses were evaluated by visual inspection and classified as presence or absence of the CAEPs components P1, N1, P2. In case of an absence fitting was adjusted accordingly. After fitting, subjects were asked to use their new setting for 2–3 weeks for acclimatization purposes and then return for retesting. At retesting, new CAEP recordings were performed to objectively ensure that the new fitting maps effectively activated the auditory cortex. Results In 14/19 subjects, as per visual inspection, clear CAEPs were recorded by each speech token and were, therefore, not refit. In the other 5 subjects, CAEPs could not be evoked for at least one speech token. The fitting maps in these subjects were adjusted until clear CAEPs were evoked for all 4 speech tokens. Conclusions CAEP can be used to quickly and objectively verify the suitability of CI fitting in experienced adult CI users with SSD. If used in the early post-implantation stage, this method could help CI users derive greater benefit for CI use and, therefore, be more committed to auditory training."
https://openalex.org/W2791030821,"In insect societies, chemical communication plays an important role in colony reproduction and individual social status. Many studies have indicated that cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are the main chemical compounds encoding reproductive status. However, these studies have largely focused on queenless or monogynous species whose workers are capable of egg laying and have mainly explored the mechanisms underlying queen-worker or worker-worker reproductive conflicts. Less is known about what occurs in highly polygynous ant species with permanently sterile workers. Here, we used the Argentine ant as a model to examine the role of CHCs in communicating reproductive information in such insect societies. The Argentine ant is unicolonial, highly polygynous, and polydomous. We identified several CHCs whose presence and levels were correlated with queen age, reproductive status, and fertility. Our results also provide new insights into queen executions in the Argentine ant, a distinctive feature displayed by this species in its introduced range. Each spring, just before new sexuals appear, workers eliminate up to 90% of the mated queens in their colonies. We discovered that queens that survived execution had different CHC profiles from queens present before and during execution. More specifically, levels of some CHCs were higher in the survivors, suggesting that workers could eliminate queens based on their chemical profiles. In addition, queen CHC profiles differed based on season and species range (native vs. introduced). Overall, the results of this study provide new evidence that CHCs serve as queen signals and do more than just regulate worker reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2792700276,"The efficiency of start codon selection during ribosomal scanning in eukaryotic translation initiation is influenced by the context or flanking nucleotides surrounding the AUG codon. The levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factors 1 (eIF1) and 5 (eIF5) play critical roles in controlling the stringency of translation start site selection. The basic leucine zipper and W2 domain-containing proteins 1 and 2 (BZW1 and BZW2), also known as eIF5-mimic proteins, are paralogous human proteins containing C-terminal HEAT domains that resemble the HEAT domain of eIF5. We show that translation of mRNAs encoding BZW1 and BZW2 homologs in fungi, plants and metazoans is initiated by AUG codons in conserved unfavorable initiation contexts. This conservation is reminiscent of the conserved unfavorable initiation context that enables autoregulation of EIF1. We show that overexpression of BZW1 and BZW2 proteins enhances the stringency of start site selection, and that their poor initiation codons confer autoregulation on BZW1 and BZW2 mRNA translation. We also show that overexpression of these two proteins significantly diminishes the effect of overexpressing eIF5 on stringency of start codon selection, suggesting they antagonize this function of eIF5. These results reveal a surprising role for BZW1 and BZW2 in maintaining homeostatic stringency of start codon selection, and taking into account recent biochemical, genetic and structural insights into eukaryotic initiation, suggest a model for BZW1 and BZW2 function."
https://openalex.org/W2794083064,"Background There is growing evidence that the accumulation of protein- bound uremic retention solutes, such as indoxyl sulfate, p-cresyl sulfate and kynurenic acid, play a role in the accelerated cardiovascular disease seen in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Protein-binding, presumably to albumin, renders these solutes poor-dialyzable. We previously observed that the free fraction of indoxyl sulfate was markedly reduced at the end of hemodialysis. We hypothesized that solute binding might be pH-dependent and attributed the changes in free solute concentration to the higher serum pH observed at the end of standard hemodialysis with dialysis buffer bicarbonate concentration greater than 35 mmol/L. We observed that acidification of uremic plasma to pH 6 in vitro greatly increased the proportion of freeIS. Methods We tested our hypothesis by reducing the dialysate bicarbonate buffer concentration to 25 mmol/L for the initial half of the hemodialysis treatment (“isohydric dialysis”). Eight stable hemodialysis patients underwent “isohydric dialysis” for 90 minutes and then were switched to standard buffer (bicarbonate = 37mmol/L). A second dialysis, 2 days later, employed standard buffer throughout. Results We found a clearcut separation of blood pH and bicarbonate concentrations after 90 minutes of “isohydric dialysis” (pH = 7.37, bicarbonate = 22.4 mmol/L) and standard dialysis (pH = 7.49, bicarbonate = 29.0 mmol/L). Binding affinity varied widely among the 10 uremic retention solutes analyzed. Kynurenic acid (0.05 free), p-cresyl sulfate (0.12 free) and indoxyl sulfate (0.13 free) demonstrated the greatest degree of binding. Three solutes (indoxyl glucuronide, p-cresyl glucuronide, and phenyl glucuronide) were virtually unbound. Analysis of free and bound concentrations of uremic retention solutes confirmed our prediction that binding of solute is affected by pH. However, in a mixed models analysis, we found that the reduction in total uremic solute concentration during dialysis accounted for a greater proportion of the variation in free concentration, presumably an effect of saturation binding to albumin, than did the relatively small change in pH produced by isohydric dialysis. The effect of pH on binding appeared to be restricted to those solutes most highly protein-bound. The solutes most tightly bound exhibited the lowest dialyzer clearances. An increase in dialyzer clearance during isohydric and standard dialyses was statistically significant only for kynurenic acid. Conclusion These findings provide evidence that the binding of uremic retention solutes is influenced by pH. The effect of reducing buffer bicarbonate concentration (“isohydric dialysis:”), though significant, was small but may be taken to suggest that further modification of dialysis technique that would expose blood to a greater decrease in pH would lead to a greater increase the free fraction of solute and enhance the efficacy of hemodialysis in the removal of highly protein-bound uremic retention solutes."
https://openalex.org/W2791695264,"The molecular mechanisms of normal cervical squamous epithelium advancing to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and eventually to cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) are largely unknown. This study explored abnormal expression of Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in cervical cancer and its correlation with the expression of E-cadherin and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6. YY1, E-cadherin and HPV16 E6 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry in 90 cervical tissue specimens collected from 30 patients with hysteromyoma, 15 patients with CIN I, 15 patients with CIN II-III, and 30 patients with CSCC. The H-score method was employed to measure the expression of YY1, E-cadherin and HPV16 E6. Increased expression of YY1 and HPV16 E6, and the decreased expression levels of E-cadherin were strongly associated with malignant transformation of the cervical epithelium and the histological progression of CSCC. The expression of YY1 in cervical tissues was inversely correlated with E-cadherin expression, and positively correlated with HPV16 E6 expression. Expression of YY1 in CSCC tissues was not significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, but was significantly correlated with an advanced clinical stage of CSCC. These results suggest that up-regulation of YY1 is closely associated with the progression of CSCC, and YY1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer by modulating the expression of E-cadherin and HPV16 E6."

https://openalex.org/W2794144617,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative syndrome classically depicted by the parenchymal accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta plaques. However, recent findings suggest intraneuronal amyloid beta (iAβ1-42) accumulation precedes extracellular deposition. Furthermore, the pathologic increase in iAβ1-42 has been implicated in dysregulation of cellular mechanisms critically important in axonal transport. Owing to neuronal cell polarity, retrograde and anterograde axonal transport are essential trafficking mechanism necessary to convey membrane bound neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and endosomes between soma and synaptic interfaces. Although iAβ1-42 disruption of axonal transport has been implicated in dysregulation of neuronal synaptic transmission, the role of iAβ1-42 and its influence on signal transduction involving the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and morphogenetic signaling axis are unknown. Our biochemical characterization of intracellular amyloid beta accumulation on MAPK and morphogenetic signaling have revealed increased iAβ1-42 expression leads to significant reduction in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and increased bone morphogenetic protein 2 dependent Smad 1/5/8 phosphorylation. Furthermore, rescue of iAβ1-42 mediated attenuation of MAPK signaling can be accomplished with the small molecule PLX4032 as a downstream enhancer of the MAPK pathway. Consequently, our observations regarding the dysregulation of these gatekeepers of neuronal viability may have important implications in understanding the iAβ1-42 mediated effects observed in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2789540974,"It has been estimated for dengue infection that the global population at risk is 3.5 billion people, which makes dengue an important public health problem. The causative agents of dengue are dengue viruses. For dengue virus replication, the dengue virus NS5 protein is of special importance as it has several enzyme activities important for viral replication. Previous reports of phosphorylation and SUMOylation of dengue NS5 have shown these protein modifications have important consequences for NS5 functions. In this report we identify glutathionylation, another reversible post translation modification that impacts on NS5 enzyme activity. Using dengue virus infected cells we employed specific antibodies and mass spectrometry to identify 3 cysteine residues of NS5 protein as being glutathionylated. Glutathionylation is a post translational protein modification where glutathione is covalently attached to a cysteine residue. We showed glutathionylation occurs on 3 conserved cysteine residues of dengue NS5. Then we generated two flavivirus recombinant full length proteins, dengue NS5 and Zika NS5, to characterize two of the NS5 enzyme activities, namely, guanylyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities. We show glutathionylation of dengue and Zika NS5 affects enzyme activities of the two flavivirus proteins. The data suggests that glutathionylation is a general feature of the flavivirus NS5 protein and the modification has the potential to modulate several of the NS5 enzyme functions."
https://openalex.org/W2792119560,"A need exists to develop bioinformatics for predicting differences in protein function, especially for members of a domain family who share a common fold, yet are found in a diverse array of proteins. Many domain families have been conserved over large evolutionary spans and representative genomic data during these periods are now available. This allows a simple method for grouping domain sequences to reveal common and unique/specific binding residues. As such, we hypothesize that sequence alignment analysis of the yeast SH3 domain family across ancestral species in the fungal kingdom can determine whether each member encodes specific information to bind unique peptide targets. With this approach, we identify important specific residues for a given domain as those that show little conservation within an alignment of yeast domain family members (paralogs) but are conserved in an alignment of its direct relatives (orthologs). We find most of the yeast SH3 domain family members have maintained unique amino acid conservation patterns that suggest they bind peptide targets with high intrinsic specificity through varying degrees of non-canonical recognition. For a minority of domains, we predict a less diverse binding surface, likely requiring additional factors to bind targets specifically. We observe that our predictions are consistent with high throughput binding data, which suggests our approach can probe intrinsic binding specificity in any other interaction domain family that is maintained during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2786668687,"Scale-adjusted metrics (SAMs) are a significant achievement of the urban scaling hypothesis. SAMs remove the inherent biases of per capita measures computed in the absence of isometric allometries. However, this approach is limited to urban areas, while a large portion of the world’s population still lives outside cities and rural areas dominate land use worldwide. Here, we extend the concept of SAMs to population density scale-adjusted metrics (DSAMs) to reveal relationships among different types of crime and property metrics. Our approach allows all human environments to be considered, avoids problems in the definition of urban areas, and accounts for the heterogeneity of population distributions within urban regions. By combining DSAMs, cross-correlation, and complex network analysis, we find that crime and property types have intricate and hierarchically organized relationships leading to some striking conclusions. Drugs and burglary had uncorrelated DSAMs and, to the extent property transaction values are indicators of affluence, twelve out of fourteen crime metrics showed no evidence of specifically targeting affluence. Burglary and robbery were the most connected in our network analysis and the modular structures suggest an alternative to “zero-tolerance” policies by unveiling the crime and/or property types most likely to affect each other."
https://openalex.org/W2792770272,"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is widely used to describe the discriminatory power of a diagnostic test to differentiate between populations having or not having a specific disease, using a dichotomous threshold. In this way, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) can be calculated to be used in Bayes' way of estimating disease probabilities. Similarly, LRs can be calculated for certain ranges of test results. However, since many diagnostic tests are of quantitative nature, it would be desirable to estimate LRs for each quantitative result. These LRs are equal to the slope of the tangent to the ROC curve at the corresponding point. Since the exact distribution of test results in diseased and non-diseased people is often not known, the calculation of such LRs for quantitative test results is not straightforward. Here, a simple distribution-independent method is described to reach this goal using Bézier curves that are defined by tangents to a curve. The use of such a method would help in standardizing quantitative test results, which are not always comparable between different test providers, by reporting them as LRs for a specific diagnosis, in addition to, or instead of, quantities such as mg/L or nmol/L, or even indices or units."
https://openalex.org/W2790539972,"Although sleep duration has been extensively studied in metabolic diseases, few studies have investigated the impact of sleep duration on chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep duration and albuminuria in the general population. Among 24,948 adults who participated in the 2011-2014 KNHANES, a total of 19,994 subjects were included in this analysis. Subjects were categorized into the following five groups according to self-reported sleep duration: less than 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, and more than 9 h. The association between sleep duration and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) was examined cross-sectionally. Subjects with both short and long sleep durations were significantly associated with higher UACR levels and higher proportions of patients with microalbuminuria (30-299 mg/g) and macroalbuminuria (≥300 mg/g) compared to those with a sleep duration of 7 hours. The U-shaped association between sleep duration and UACR remained significant even after adjustment for potential confounders, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, education, income, exercise, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The U-shaped association is more evident in the subgroup aged 65 or older, or in female subjects. Our findings suggest that both short and long sleep durations have a U-shaped association with UACR levels in the general population, independent of potential confounders."
https://openalex.org/W2793555397,"The paucity of studies on permafrost runoff generation processes, especially in mountain permafrost, constrains the understanding of permafrost hydrology and prediction of hydrological responses to permafrost degradation. This study investigated runoff generation processes, in addition to the contribution of summer thaw depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, and precipitation to streamflow in a small upland permafrost basin in the northern Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that the thawing period and the duration of the zero-curtain were longer in permafrost of the northern Tibetan Plateau than in the Arctic. Limited snowmelt delayed the initiation of surface runoff in the peat permafrost in the study area. The runoff displayed intermittent generation, with the duration of most runoff events lasting less than 24 h. Precipitation without runoff generation was generally correlated with lower soil moisture conditions. Combined analysis suggested runoff generation in this region was controlled by soil temperature, thaw depth, precipitation frequency and amount, and antecedent soil moisture. This study serves as an important baseline to evaluate future environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau."
https://openalex.org/W2792339773,"Objective To determine the predictive value of leg and trunk inclination angles at stepping-foot contact for the capacity to recover from a backward balance perturbation with a single step in people after stroke. Methods Twenty-four chronic stroke survivors and 21 healthy controls were included in a cross-sectional study. We studied reactive stepping responses by subjecting participants to multidirectional stance perturbations at different intensities on a translating platform. In this paper we focus on backward perturbations. Participants were instructed to recover from the perturbations with maximally one step. A trial was classified as ‘success’ if balance was restored according to this instruction. We recorded full-body kinematics and computed: 1) body configuration parameters at first stepping-foot contact (leg and trunk inclination angles) and 2) spatiotemporal step parameters (step onset, step length, step duration and step velocity). We identified predictors of balance recovery capacity using a stepwise logistic regression. Perturbation intensity was also included as a predictor. Results The model with spatiotemporal parameters (perturbation intensity, step length and step duration) could correctly classify 85% of the trials as success or fail (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.61). In the body configuration model (Nagelkerke R2 = 0.71), perturbation intensity and leg and trunk angles correctly classified the outcome of 86% of the recovery attempts. The goodness of fit was significantly higher for the body configuration model compared to the model with spatiotemporal variables (p<0.01). Participant group and stepping leg (paretic or non-paretic) did not significantly improve the explained variance of the final body configuration model. Conclusions Body configuration at stepping-foot contact is a valid and clinically feasible indicator of backward fall risk in stroke survivors, given its potential to be derived from a single sagittal screenshot."
https://openalex.org/W2788779464,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide. The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a nuclear receptor regulating several target genes associated with cancer malignancy. We here demonstrated a significant effect of PXR on HNSCC cell growth, as evidenced in PXR knock-down experiments. PXR transcriptional activity is more importantly regulated by the presence of coactivators and corepressors than by PXR protein expression. To date, there is scarce information on the regulation of PXR in HNSCC and on its role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Coactivator and corepressor expression was screened through qRT-PCR in 8 HNSCC cell lines and correlated to PXR activity, determined by using a reporter gene assay. All cell lines considerably expressed all the cofactors assessed. PXR activity negatively correlated with nuclear receptor corepressor 2 (NCoR2) expression, indicating a major role of this corepressor in PXR modulation and suggesting its potential as a surrogate for PXR activity in HNSCC. To test the association of NCoR2 with the malignant phenotype, a subset of three cell lines was transfected with an over-expression plasmid for this corepressor. Subsequently, cell growth and chemoresistance assays were performed. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying NCoR2 effects on cell growth, caspase 3/7 activity and protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP were evaluated. In HNO97 cells, NCoR2 over-expression decreased cell growth, chemoresistance and increased cleaved caspase 3 levels, caspase activity and cleaved PARP levels. On the contrary, in HNO124 and HNO210 cells, NCoR2 over-expression increased cell growth, drug resistance and decreased cleaved caspase 3 levels, caspase activity and cleaved PARP levels. In conclusion, we demonstrated a role of PXR and NCoR2 in the modulation of cell growth in HNSCC. This may contribute to a better understanding of the highly variable HNSCC therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2789137692,"Grunting is pervasive in many athletic contests, and empirical evidence suggests that it may result in one exerting more physical force. It may also distract one's opponent. That grunts can distract was supported by a study showing that it led to an opponent being slower and more error prone when viewing tennis shots. An alternative explanation was that grunting masks the sound of a ball being hit. The present study provides evidence against this alternative explanation by testing the effect of grunting in a sport-mixed martial arts-where distraction, rather than masking, is the most likely mechanism.We first confirmed that kicking force is increased when a grunt is performed (Experiment 1), and then adapted methodology used in the tennis study to mixed martial arts (Experiment 2). Lifting the foot to kick is a silent act, and therefore there is nothing for a grunt to mask, i.e., its effect on an opponent's response time and/or accuracy can likely be attributed to attentional distraction. Participants viewed videos of a trained mixed martial artist kicking that included, or did not include, a simulated grunt. The task was to determine as quickly as possible whether the kick was traveling upward or downward. Overall, and replicating the tennis finding, the present results indicate that a participant's response to a kick was delayed and more error prone when a simulated grunt was present.The present findings indicate that simulated grunting may distract an opponent, leading to slower and more error prone responses. The implications for martial arts in particular, and the broader question of whether grunting should be perceived as 'cheating' in sports, are examined."
https://openalex.org/W2790494654,"Objective The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) involves a disturbed balance of breakdown and buildup of arterial proteins. We envision that individuals with AAA carry generalized arterial protein alterations either because of effects of genetically or environmental AAA risk factors or because of compensatory changes due to signaling molecules released from the affected aneurysmal tissue. Approach Protein extraction and quantitative proteome analysis by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) was done on individual samples from the internal mammary artery from 11 individuals with AAA and 33 sex- and age-matched controls without AAA. Samples were selected from a biobank of leftover internal mammary arterial tissue gathered at coronary by-pass operations. Results We identified and quantitated 877 proteins, of which 44 were differentially expressed between the two groups (nominal p-values without correction for multiple testing). Some proteins related to the extracellular matrix displayed altered concentrations in the AAA group, particularly among elastin-related molecules [elastin, microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4), lysyl oxidase]. In addition, several histones e.g. (e.g. HIST1H1E, HIST1H2BB) and other vascular cell proteins (e.g. versican, type VI collagen) were altered. Conclusions Our results support the notion that generalized alterations occur in the arterial tree in patients with AAA. Elastin-related proteins and histones seem to be part of such changes, however these preliminary results require replication in an independent set of specimens and validation by functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W4245333301,"The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) is an innate neural reflex where parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves work jointly to control inflammation. Activation of CAP by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has paved way for novel therapeutic strategies in treating inflammatory diseases. Recently, we discovered that VNS mediated splenic acetylcholine (ACh) release and subsequent immunosuppression in response to LPS associated inflammation is impaired in mice lacking microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression, a key enzyme responsible for prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Here, we have further investigated the consequences of mPGES-1 deficiency on various molecular/cellular events in the spleen which is critical for the optimal functioning of VNS in endotoxaemic mice. First, VNS induced splenic norepinephrine (NE) release in both mPGES-1 (+/+) and (-/-) mice. Compared to mPGES-1 (+/+), immunomodulatory effects of NE on cytokines were strongly compromised in mPGES-1 (-/-) splenocytes. Interestingly, while LPS increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) protein level in mPGES-1 (+/+) splenocytes, it failed to exert similar effects in mPGES-1 (-/-) splenocytes despite unaltered β2 AR protein expression. In addition, nicotine inhibited TNFα release by LPS activated mPGES-1 (+/+) splenocytes in vitro. However, such immunosuppressive effects of nicotine were reversed both in mPGES-1 (-/-) mouse splenocytes and human PBMC treated with mPGES-1 inhibitor. In summary, our data implicate PGE2 as an important mediator of ACh synthesis and noradrenergic/cholinergic molecular events in the spleen that constitute a crucial part of the CAP immune regulation. Our results suggest a possible link between cholinergic and PG system of CAP that may be of clinical significance in VNS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2787877499,"Human fishing effort is size-selective, preferentially removing the largest individuals from harvested stocks. Intensive, size-specific fishing mortality induces directional shifts in phenotypic frequencies towards the predominance of smaller and earlier-maturing individuals, which are among the primary causes of declining fish biomass. Fish that reproduce at smaller size and younger age produce fewer, smaller, and less viable larvae, severely reducing the reproductive capacity of harvested populations. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are extensively utilized in coral reefs for fisheries management, and are thought to mitigate the impacts of size-selective fishing mortality and supplement fished stocks through larval export. However, empirical evidence of disparities in fitness-relevant phenotypes between MPAs and adjacent fished reefs is necessary to validate this assertion. Here, we compare key life-history traits in three coral-reef fishes (Acanthurus nigrofuscus, Ctenochaetus striatus, and Parupeneus multifasciatus) between MPAs and fished reefs in the Philippines. Results of our analyses support previous hypotheses regarding the impacts of MPAs on phenotypic traits. Asymptotic length (Linf) and growth rates (K) differed between conspecifics in MPAs and fished reefs, with protected populations exhibiting phenotypes that are known to confer higher fecundity. Additionally, populations demonstrated increases in length at 50% maturity (L50) inside MPAs compared to adjacent areas, although age at 50% maturity (A50) did not appear to be impacted by MPA establishment. Shifts toward advantageous phenotypes were most common in the oldest and largest MPAs, but occurred in all of the MPAs examined. These results suggest that MPAs may provide protection against the impacts of size-selective harvest on life-history traits in coral-reef fishes."

From May 2016 to January 2017, we provided 500 HIV urine-testing service packs for display at the drugstores, and a total of 430 (86.0%) urine specimens were mailed back. All of the 430 urine specimens were of good quality and were tested. 70 urine specimens were HIV positive, showing a 16.3% (70/430) positivity rate. A total of 94.3% (66/70) of the HIV-positive participants obtained their test results through the internet, and 69.7% (46/66) of these participants received follow-up care. A total of 40 out of 46 (87.0%) participants agreed to have their results confirmed by a blood test, and 39 out of 40 (97.5%) participants were confirmed as HIV-1 positive, including two individuals that were previously diagnosed. Lastly, 28 out of 37 (75.7%) of the study participants were referred to the hospital and provided free antiviral treatment.

We have recently identified 4-fluoro-3’,4’,5’-trimethoxychalcone or C16 as a potent anti-invasive molecule. In this paper, we report on the development of an optimized vehicle for oral administration of C16. We also explore its pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile in rodents as a prelude to a broad-scope evaluation as a pharmacological tool in animal models of disease. C16 showed suboptimal pharmacokinetics with limited oral bioavailability and whole blood stability. Rapid metabolism with elimination via glutathione conjugation was observed. An oral dosing routine using medicated gels was developed to overcome bioavailability issues and yielded sustained whole blood levels above the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) in a 7-day study. The compound proved well-tolerated in acute and chronic experiments at 300 mg/kg PO dosing. The medicated gel formulation is highly suitable for evaluation of C16 in animal models of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2789941448,"In some insect species, females may base their choice for a suitable mate on male odor. In the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, female choice is based on a male’s odor bouquet as well as its thorax vibrations, and its relatedness to the female, a putative form of optimal outbreeding. Interestingly, O. bicornis can be found as two distinct color morphs in Europe, which are thought to represent subspecies and between which we hypothesize that female discrimination may be particularly marked. Here we investigated (i) if these two colors morphs do indeed represent distinct, reproductively differentiated populations, (ii) how odor bouquets of male O. bicornis vary within and between populations, and (iii) whether variation in male odor correlates with genetic distance, which might represent a cue by which females could optimally outbreed. Using GC and GC-MS analysis of male odors and microsatellite analysis of males and females from 9 populations, we show that, in Denmark, an area of subspecies sympatry, the two color morphs at any one site do not differ, either in odor bouquet or in population genetic differentiation. Yet populations across Europe are distinct in their odor profile as well as being genetically differentiated. Odor differences do not, however, mirror genetic differentiation between populations. We hypothesize that populations from Germany, England and Denmark may be under sexual selection through female choice for local odor profiles, which are not related to color morph though which could ultimately lead to population divergence and speciation."
https://openalex.org/W2791128218,"Background Control of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is an increasingly important issue. Enhancing screening coverage is necessary to discover more HCV infected subjects in community. However, a substantial population is unaware of HCV infection that needs more attention. Aim The aims of this study were to evaluate the status of HCV infected residents in remote villages, to compare characteristics between already known and unaware HCV infection subjects, and to analyze the disease insights. Patients and methods Screening intervention for liver diseases was conducted in remote villages of Tainan City of southern Taiwan from August 2014 to July 2016. Items of screening examinations included questionnaire, blood sampling for liver tests and viral hepatitis markers (hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV antibody), abdominal sonography survey, and liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography. Quantitation of HCV RNA was measured for residents with positive anti-HCV antibody. Results A total of 194 (13.5%) out of 1439 participants showed positive for anti-HCV antibody. HCV viremia was detected in 119 (61.3%) residents. Previously unaware HCV infection by questionnaire record was present in 68 (35.1%) of ant-HCV positive residents. By multivariate logistic analysis, unaware HCV infected residents exhibited significantly mild liver fibrosis (OR 0.876, 95% CI 0.782~0.981, p = 0.022), more prevalent of heart diseases (OR 6.082, 95% CI 1.963~18.839, p = 0.002), and less cluster of family history of liver diseases (OR 0.291, 95% CI 0.113~0.750, p = 0.011) when comparing with already known HCV infected residents. Among the 126 already know HCV infected residents, only 59 (46.8%) received antiviral treatment or regular follow-up. No concept or no willing to receive medical care was observed in 44 (34.9%) residents. Conclusion In HCV endemic villages of Taiwan, residents with unaware HCV infection comprised about one third of HCV infected residents and exhibited obscure characteristics to identify. Less than half of already known HCV infected residents received adequate medical care. To eliminate HCV infection, vigorous efforts on enhancing screening coverage, educating update knowledge of liver diseases, and linking to medical care are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2792166219,"Asthma affects a large number of patients in China, but comprehensive evaluation of risks associated with poor asthma control in asthmatic patients with nasal diseases was still limited. We conducted this study to provide a comprehensive estimate of asthma control in Chinese asthma patients with combined nasal diseases, to explore the effect of kinds of nasal diseases on the asthma control, and to identify risk factors associated with uncontrolled asthmatic patients with combined nasal diseases. 1756 asthma patients concomitant with nasal diseases aged ≥17 years and representing all regions of mainland China were surveyed. Multivariate logistic regression model with all related demographic characteristics and disease characteristics factors entered was used to identify risk factors associated with uncontrolled asthma. 56.4% of asthmatic patients with combined allergic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis or rhinopolyp remained uncontrolled. Concomitant without allergic rhinitis, younger age, better treatment adherence and higher education level might positively impact asthma control among asthmatic patients with combined nasal diseases. Perennial allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.5, P = 0.021), moderate-severe allergic rhinitis (OR = 2.2, P = 0.001) were all found to significantly increase the risk of uncontrolled asthma among asthma patients with combined allergic rhinitis. The high prevalence of uncontrolled asthma indicates that asthma management among adult Chinese asthmatic patients comorbid with nasal disease is still a challenge. Efforts should be made to raise the awareness of asthma management and to provide sufficient treatment will greatly contribute to improved quality of asthma management. It is possible to minimize the influence of allergic rhinitis on asthma control by improving nasal function, especially for more severe allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis."
https://openalex.org/W2788709774,"The airway epithelium in human plays a central role as the first line of defense against environmental contaminants. Most respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and respiratory infections, disturb normal muco-ciliary functions by stimulating the hypersecretion of mucus. Several muco-active agents have been used to treat hypersecretion symptoms in patients. Current muco-active reagents control mucus secretion by modulating either airway inflammation, cholinergic parasympathetic nerve activities or by reducing the viscosity by cleaving crosslinking in mucin and digesting DNAs in mucus. However, none of the current medication regulates mucus secretion by directly targeting airway goblet cells. The major hurdle for screening potential muco-active agents that directly affect the goblet cells, is the unavailability of in vivo model systems suitable for high-throughput screening. In this study, we developed a high-throughput in vivo model system for identifying muco-active reagents using Xenopus laevis embryos. We tested mucus secretion under various conditions and developed a screening strategy to identify potential muco-regulators. Using this novel screening technique, we identified narasin as a potential muco-regulator. Narasin treatment of developing Xenopus embryos significantly reduced mucus secretion. Furthermore, the human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3, responded similarly to narasin treatment, validating our technique for discovering muco-active reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2792238634,"M. tuberculosis oxidation sense Regulator (MosR) is a transcriptional regulator from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It senses the environment oxidation and regulates the expression of a secreted oxidoreductase, thus defending the bacilli against oxidative stress from the phagosome. While most of the members of the Multiple antibiotics resistance Regulator (MarR) family are ligand-responsive, MosR may dissociate from its DNA site upon formation of an intrachain disulphide bond. However, the structure of MosR in its oxidized state is not known, and it is not clear how the formation of this disulphide bond would lead to the conformational changes required for dissociation of the DNA. Nonetheless, MosR presents two crystallographically resolved conformations in its reduced state: bound and unbound to DNA. We managed to simulate MosR unbound to the DNA, both in the presence and in the absence of the disulphide bond. Our results indicate that this disulphide bond precludes the N-terminal residues from adopting a conformation that stands in-between the helix α1 and the DNA binding domain (DBD) from the other chain. Once this conformation is achieved in the reduced state, this DBD detaches from the dimerization domain and becomes more flexible, being able to perform motions with higher amplitude and higher degree of collectivity. Only then, MosR may achieve a conformation where its recognition helices fit into the major grooves of its DNA site. The analysis of the collective motions performed by MosR, during the different situations sampled by the molecular dynamics (MDs), was only possible by the method of filtering harmonic modes with specific frequencies. The frequency of the collective motions performed by the DBD of MosR in the reduced state to achieve a DNA-binding conformation is in the range of 20 to 50 MHz, but it may be associated to more sporadic events since it requires the combination of a suitable conformation of the N-terminal residues."
https://openalex.org/W2950527071,"An accurate quantitative relationship between key characteristics of an insect population, such as season-long and peak abundances, can be very useful in pest management programs. To the best of our knowledge, no such relationship has yet been established. Here we establish a predictive linear relationship between insect catch Mpw during the week of peak abundance, the length of seasonal flight period, F (number of weeks) and season-long cumulative catch (abundance) A = 0.41MpwF. The derivation of the equation is based on several general assumptions and does not involve fitting to experimental data, which implies generality of the result. A quantitative criterion for the validity of the model is presented. The equation was tested using extensive data collected on captures of male gypsy moths Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) in pheromone-baited traps during 15 years. The model was also tested using trap catch data for two species of mosquitoes, Culex pipiens (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), in Gravid and BG-sentinel mosquito traps, respectively. The simple, parameter-free equation approximates experimental data points with relative error of 13% and R2 = 0.997, across all of the species tested. For gypsy moth, we also related season-long and weekly trap catches to the daily trap catches during peak flight. We describe several usage scenarios, in which the derived relationships are employed to help link results of small-scale field studies to the operational pest management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2788613610,"Homologous recombination (HR) is crucial for the error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the restart of stalled replication. However, imprecise HR can lead to genome instability, highlighting the importance of HR quality control. After DSB formation, HR proceeds via DNA end resection and recombinase loading, whereas helicase-catalyzed disruption of a subset of subsequently formed DNA invasions is thought to be essential for maintaining HR accuracy via inhibiting illegitimate (non-allelic) recombination. Here we show that in vitro characterized mechanistic aberrations of E. coli RecBCD (resection and recombinase loading) RecQ (multifunctional DNA-restructuring helicase) mutant enzyme variants, on one hand, cumulatively deteriorate cell survival under certain conditions of genomic stress. On the other hand, we find that RecBCD and RecQ defects functionally compensate each other in terms of HR accuracy. The abnormally long resection and unproductive recombinase loading activities of a mutant RecBCD complex (harboring the D1080A substitution in RecB) cause enhanced illegitimate recombination. However, this compromised HR-accuracy phenotype is suppressed in double mutant strains harboring mutant RecQ variants with abnormally enhanced helicase and inefficient invasion disruptase activities. These results frame an in vivo context for the interplay of biochemical activities leading to illegitimate recombination, and underscore its long-range genome instability effects manifest in higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2788696037,"The duration of reach-to-grasp movements is influenced by the size of the contact surfaces, such that grasping objects with smaller contact surface areas takes longer. But what is the influence of asymmetric contact surfaces? In Experiment 1a, participants reached-to-lift wooden blocks off a table top, with the contact locations for the thumb and index finger varying in surface size. The time taken to lift the block was driven primarily by the thumb contact surface, which showed a larger effect size for the dependent variable of movement duration than the index finger's contact surface. In Experiment 1b participants reached-to-grasp (but not lift) the blocks. The same effect was found with duration being largely driven by contact surface size for the thumb. Experiment 2 tested whether this finding generalised to movements towards conical frusta grasped in a different plane mounted off the table top. Experiment 2 showed that movement duration again was dictated primarily by the size of the thumb's contact surface. The thumb contact surface was the visible surface in experiments 1 and 2 so Experiment 3 explored grasping when the index finger's contact surface was visible (participants grasped the frusta with the index finger at the top). An interaction between thumb and finger surface size was now found to determine movement duration. These findings provide the first empirical report of the impact of asymmetric contact surfaces on prehension, and may have implications for scientists who wish to model reach-to-grasp behaviours."

Although nerve injury may cause CRPS, pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the syndrome are unclear, and local edema, a characteristic of CRPS, has not been evaluated quantitatively for technical reasons. Here, using a rat spinal nerve ligation-induced CRPS model, we show that edematous changes in gastrocnemius muscle can be detected quantitatively by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using the line-scan diffusion spectrum on a 1.5 T clinical MR imager, we demonstrate significant elevation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios in gastrocnemius muscle on the ligated versus the sham-operated rats by one day after surgery, those ratios gradually decreased over time. Meanwhile, T2 ratios in gastrocnemius muscle on the ligated rats increased gradually and significantly, peaking two weeks after surgery, and those ratios remained high and were consistent with edema. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of blood vessel formation and function, was significantly lower in gastrocnemius muscle on the ligated versus non-ligated side, suggesting that nerve ligation promotes edematous changes and perturbs VEGF expression in target muscle."
