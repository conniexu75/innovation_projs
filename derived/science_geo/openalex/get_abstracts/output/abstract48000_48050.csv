https://openalex.org/W2018222414,"Dense, focal injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated-horseradish peroxidase in the locus coeruleus of rats labeled afferent neurons in unexpectedly few brain regions. Major inputs emanate from only two nuclei--the paragigantocellularis and the prepositus hypoglossi, both in the rostral medulla. The dorsal cap of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and the spinal intermediate gray are possible minor afferents to locus coeruleus. Other areas reported to project to locus coeruleus (for example, amygdala, nucleus tractus solitarius, and spinal dorsal horn) did not exhibit consistent retrograde labeling. Anterograde tracing and electrophysiologic experiments confirmed the absence of input to locus coeruleus from these areas, which instead terminate in targets adjacent to locus coeruleus. These findings redefine the anatomic organization of the locus coeruleus, and have implications for hypotheses concerning the functions of this noradrenergic brain nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2081516433,"The protein loop, a novel category of nonregular secondary structure, is a segment of contiguous polypeptide chain that traces a ""loop-shaped"" path in three-dimensional space; the main chain of an idealized loop resembles a Greek omega (omega). A systematic study was made of 67 proteins of known structure revealing 270 omega loops. Although such loops are typically regarded as ""random coil,"" they are, in fact, highly compact substructures and may also be independent folding units. Loops are almost invariably situated at the protein surface where they are poised to assume important roles in molecular function and biological recognition. They are often observed to be modules of evolutionary exchange and are also natural candidates for bioengineering studies."

https://openalex.org/W1659953295,"Bradykinin stimulation of inositol polyphosphate production was followed using [3H]inositol-labeled porcine aortic endothelial cells grown in culture. Bradykinin stimulated a significant increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production within 15 s. This increase reached a maximum value of 5-fold above control at 30 s and returned toward baseline by 90 s. Production of inositol bisphosphate increased with time reaching 4-fold by 60 s. Bradykinin stimulated the production of IP3 and inositol biphosphate in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 9 X 10(-9) M. Labeled pools of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIPP) decreased by 50% within 30 s, corresponding to the rise in IP3, while labeled lysophosphatidylinositol pools increased 3-fold by 60 s. Pertussis toxin, a protein which ribosylates GTP-binding proteins, did not inhibit bradykinin-stimulated inositol polyphosphate production. Incubation of labeled cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ also did not affect bradykinin-stimulated inositol polyphosphate production. Further, A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, failed to stimulate PIPP metabolism. Finally, Ca2+ influx into cell monolayers occurred with a time course which paralleled rather than preceded the increase in IP3 levels. These data suggest that bradykinin stimulates phospholipase C metabolism of PIPP to IP3 by a mechanism which does not contain a pertussis toxin sensitive GTP-binding protein. Also, this receptor-linked phospholipase C activity does not appear to be activated by extracellular Ca2+ influx. The results support the proposal that IP3 production initiates Ca2+ mobilization and suggest that the calcium-dependent step in arachidonate release is distal to IP3 production."

https://openalex.org/W1551180853,"A novel glycosphingolipid-degrading enzyme was found in the cultured supernatant of Rhodococcus sp. G-74-2. It was purified 34.7-fold from the supernatant with 32.2% recovery by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The enzyme was demonstrated capable of cleaving the linkage between the oligosaccharide and ceramide of various acidic and neutral glycosphingolipids, producing intact oligosaccharides and ceramides. However, it was noted to hardly make any attack on linkages between monosaccharides and ceramides (cerebrosides) or between oligosaccharides and diacylglycerol (glycoglycerolipids). The enzyme preparation was completely free from various exoglycosidases and proteases. Furthermore, it was found to degrade neither N-linked nor O-linked glycoproteins. This enzyme, which is tentatively called endoglycoceramidase, should greatly facilitate the study of glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1875021313,"A study of the hinge bending mode in the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase is made by use of empirical energy functions. The enzyme is a dimer, with each monomer composed of a coenzyme binding domain and a catalytic domain with a large cleft between the two. Superposition of the apoenzyme and holoenzyme crystal structures is used to determine a rigid rotation axis for closing of the cleft. It is shown that a rigid body transformation of the apoenzyme to the holoenzyme structure corresponds to a 10 degrees rotation of the catalytic domain about this axis. The rotation is not along the least-motion path for closing of the cleft but instead corresponds to the catalytic domain coming closer to the coenzyme binding domain by a sliding motion. Estimation of the energy associated with the interdomain motion of the apoenzyme over a range of 90 degrees (-40 to 50 degrees, where 0 degrees corresponds to the minimized crystal structure) demonstrates that local structural relaxation makes possible large-scale rotations with relatively small energy increments. A variety of structural rearrangements associated with the domain motion are characterized. They involve the hinge region residues that provide the covalent connections between the two domains and certain loop regions that are brought into contact by the rotation. Differences between the energy minimized and the holoenzyme structures point to the existence of alternative conformations for loops and to the importance of the ligands in the structural rearrangements."
https://openalex.org/W1582147229,"Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase was purified approximately 74,000-fold to apparent homogeneity from calf thymus with a yield of 3.2%. The enzyme was a monomeric protein of Mr = 59,000, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The action of glycohydrolase on poly(ADP-ribose) was exoglycosidic in the direction of adenosine terminus----ribose terminus; radioactive ADP-ribose monomers were immediately produced from evenly labeled poly(ADP-ribose), but not from the polymer labeled selectively at the ribose terminus. The enzymatic degradation of large poly(ADP-ribose) (greater than 20 ADP-ribose residues) proceeded in a biphasic as well as bimodal manner. In the early and rapid phase, the enzyme degraded part of large polymers successively, leaving the remainder completely intact, and accumulated ADP-ribose monomers and small polymers of the size less than half of original polymers, indicating that the enzyme action was processive up to a certain extent. In the late and 20-fold slower phase, by contrast, the enzyme degraded the accumulated small polymers gradually and evenly, i.e. in a nonprocessive manner. The Km for large polymers was approximately 100-fold lower than that for small polymers. Similar rates and processivities were observed with large and small polymers bound to various proteins. These results suggested that the glycohydrolase may regulate differentially the levels of large and small poly(ADP-ribose) in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1651932548,"The three-dimensional structure of trimethylamine dehydrogenase from the methylotrophic bacterium W3A1 has been determined to 2.4-A resolution. The enzyme is composed of two identical 83,000-dalton subunits, each of which is folded into three structural domains. The largest domain, at the NH2 terminus of the molecule, is folded as an eight-stranded parallel alpha/beta barrel. It contains the [4Fe-4S] and covalently bound FMN cofactors separated by about 4 A. The folding topology of the large domain and orientation of the FMN cofactor are very similar to those found in glycolate oxidase. The other two domains contain alpha/beta parallel beta sheet topologies with similar folding patterns. The topologies and spatial arrangements of these two domains are remarkably similar to the FAD- and NADPH-binding domains of glutathione reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1482764356,"GTP and GTP analogs produced significant (up to 17-fold) and persistent activation of adenylate cyclase in lysates of Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba. The activation was enhanced 2- to 4-fold by cAMP (the agonist for receptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activation), was specific for guanine nucleoside triphosphates, and was inhibited by guanosine 5'-(O-2-thio)diphosphate. The order of potency of guanine nucleotides was guanosine 5'-(O-3-thio)triphosphate greater than guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate greater than GTP; half-maximal activation was observed with 1-10 microM guanine nucleotide. Maximal activation occurred when the guanine nucleotide was added within seconds after cell lysis and the lysate was preincubated for 5 min prior to assay. Under these optimal in vitro conditions, the capacity of guanine nucleotides to activate decreased, closely correlating with adaptation or desensitization induced by exposure of intact cells to cAMP during a period of 10 min. These data strongly support that regulation of adenylate cyclase in Dictyostelium occurs via a receptor-linked GTP/GDP exchange protein. Two mutants, designated synag 7 and 49 were isolated in which cAMP and/or guanine nucleotides were not sufficient to activate adenylate cyclase. The wild-type pattern of guanine nucleotide regulation was restored to synag 7 lysates by the addition of a high-speed supernatant from wild-type cells. Characterization of these mutants demonstrates that activation of adenylate cyclase is not required for growth or cell-type specific differentiation but is essential for cellular aggregation and influences morphogenesis and pattern formation. This suggests that Dictyostelium may provide a model suitable for detailed genetic analysis of surface receptor-guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein linked adenylate cyclase systems and for determining the role of these systems in development."
https://openalex.org/W16313930,"The two human alpha-globin genes, alpha 1 and alpha 2, are coexpressed in normal erythroid cells and encode identical alpha-globin protein products. Based upon genetic studies, it has been assumed that these two adjacent and highly homologous genes are equally expressed. In previous studies we have, however, demonstrated that the alpha 2 gene encodes a 2-3-fold higher steady state level of mRNA than the alpha 1 gene. In the present study, we monitor the relative levels of protein production from these two loci by quantitating the synthesis of specific alpha-globin structural mutants encoded by each alpha-globin gene. These values are then used to infer the relative contributions of the normal alpha 1 and alpha 2 loci to total alpha-globin production. The results of eight separate studies, each based upon a different alpha-globin structural mutant mapped to either the alpha 1 or the alpha 2 locus, are internally consistent. The data demonstrate that the alpha 2 gene encodes 2-3-fold more protein than the alpha 1 gene. These results suggest that the human alpha-globin gene cluster contains a major and a minor locus. The dominant expression of the alpha 2 gene predicts a greater impact of mutations at this locus, in comparison to mutations at the alpha 1 locus, in the generation of the alpha-thalassemia phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1480675692,"Polyclonal antibodies against rat brain protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) were raised in goat. These antibodies can neutralize completely the kinase activity in purified enzyme preparation as well as that in the crude homogenate. Immunoblot analysis of the purified and the crude protein kinase C preparations revealed a major immunoreactive band of 80 kDa. The antibodies also recognize the same enzyme from other rat tissues. Neuronal tissues (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, and retina) and lymphoid organs (thymus and spleen) were found to be enriched in protein kinase C, whereas lung, kidney, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle contained relatively low amounts of this kinase. Limited proteolysis of the purified rat brain protein kinase C with trypsin results in an initial degradation of the kinase into two major fragments of 48 and 38 kDa. Both fragments are recognized by the antibodies. However, further digestion of the 48-kDa fragment to 45 kDa and the 38-kDa fragment to 33 kDa causes a loss of the immunoreactivity. Upon incubation of the cerebellar extract with Ca2+, the 48-kDa fragment was also identified as a major proteolytic product of protein kinase C. Proteolytic degradation of protein kinase C converts the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent kinase to an independent form without causing a large impairment of the binding of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. The two major proteolytic fragments were separated by ion exchange chromatography and one of them (45-48 kDa) was identified as a protein kinase and the other (33-38 kDa) as a phorbol ester-binding protein. This degraded form of the phorbol ester-binding protein still requires phospholipid for activity but, unlike the native enzyme, becomes less dependent on Ca2+. These results demonstrate that rat brain protein kinase C is composed of two functionally distinct units, namely, a protein kinase and a Ca2+-independent/phospholipid-dependent phorbol ester-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2064754438,Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency in man is responsible for familial porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. A recent study of a family with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria showed that the enzyme defect resulted from rapid degradation of the protein in vivo. Cloning and sequencing of a complementary DNA for the mutated gene revealed that the mutation was due to the replacement of a glycine residue by a glutamic acid residue at position 281. This base change leads to a protein that is very rapidly degraded in the presence of cell lysate. Characterization of the mutation will allow comparison of this defect in a homozygous patient with defects in other patients with familial porphyria cutanea tarda.
https://openalex.org/W1481079067,"We have previously reported that fodrin (beta subunit), tubulin (alpha subunit) and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs; MAP2 and tau) are good substrates for the purified insulin receptor kinase (Kadowaki, T., Nishida, E., Kasuga, M., Akiyama, T., Takaku, F., Ishikawa, M., Sakai, H., Kathuria, S., and Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 127, 493-500 and Kadowaki, T., Fujita-Yamaguchi, Y., Nishida, E., Takaku, F., Akiyama, T., Kathuria, S., Akanuma, Y., and Kasuga, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 4016-4020). In this study, to investigate the substrate specificities of tyrosine kinases, we have examined the actions of the purified epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor kinase and Rous sarcoma virus src kinase on purified microfilament- and microtubule-related proteins. Among microfilament-related proteins examined, the purified EGF receptor kinase phosphorylated the beta subunit, but not the alpha subunit, of fodrin on tyrosine residues with a Km below the micromolar range. The fodrin phosphorylation by the EGF receptor kinase was markedly inhibited by F-actin. In contrast, the purified src kinase preferentially phosphorylated the alpha subunit of fodrin on tyrosine residues. Fodrin phosphorylation by the src kinase was not inhibited by F-actin. Among microtubule proteins examined, MAP2 was the best substrate for the EGF receptor kinase. By contrast, src kinase favored phosphorylation of tubulin as compared to MAP2. The peptide mapping of MAP2 phosphorylated by the EGF receptor kinase and by the insulin receptor kinase produced very similar patterns of phosphopeptides, while that of MAP2 phosphorylated by the src kinase gave a distinctly different pattern. When the phosphorylation of the tubulin subunits was examined, the EGF receptor kinase preferred beta subunit to alpha subunit, but the src kinase phosphorylated both alpha and beta subunits to a similar extent. These results, together with our previous results, indicate that the substrate specificities of the EGF receptor kinase and the insulin receptor kinase are very similar, but not identical, while that of the src kinase is distinctly different from that of these growth factor receptor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1488315374,"We evaluated the effects of a synthetic copy of a highly conserved portion (residues 225-246) of the COOH-propeptide of human pro-alpha 2(I) procollagen on collagen, fibronectin, and total protein synthesis by human fibroblasts. Incubation of COOH-propeptide 225-246 with fibroblasts resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of both type I procollagen and fibronectin when compared with controls; a 50% inhibition of both fibronectin and type I collagen was observed at a concentration of 45 microM. Since the overall cellular protein synthesis was only minimally affected, COOH-propeptide appeared to specifically inhibit collagen and fibronectin synthesis. The peptide was nontoxic to cells and the inhibition was completely reversible upon removal of the peptide. We measured the steady-state levels of mRNAs coding for procollagen, fibronectin, and beta-actin by hybridization to specific recombinant cDNA probes; there was no significant change in the steady-state level of mRNAs of the three proteins. These results strongly suggest that the biosynthesis of procollagen and fibronectin in COOH-propeptide-treated cells is inhibited at a post-transcriptional level. These data establish a link between collagen and fibronectin synthesis and further define the important interaction of these molecules in the formation of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1597924883,"Employing reconstitution assays and measurement of cytochrome P-450 content, lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase have been studied in solubilized preparations of rat hepatic microsomes. Both activities have been resolved from other cytochrome P-450 isozymes and each other by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and adsorption on hydroxylapatite. The demethylase has been further purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography on Mono-S resin. The purified cytochrome displays a specific content of 15.8 nmol of heme/mg of protein and a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an apparent Mr of 51,000. A Soret maximum for the reduced/CO binding complex at 448 nm is observed. Reconstitution of the purified cytochrome with NADPH-cytochrome-c reductase, dilaurylphosphatidylcholine, NADPH, and O2 supports the demethylation process which is inhibited by CO. Reconstitution also affords accumulation of oxygenated, metabolic intermediates with single catalytic turnover of the cytochrome, thus supporting the hypothesis that a single isozyme of cytochrome P-450 is responsible for all three oxidations and the lyase activity involved in the lanosterol C-32 demethylation sequence. Low oxidase activity toward several xenobiotic substrates and selectivity toward endogenous sterol substrates is observed for the purified cytochrome. These results indicate a high degree of substrate specificity for the cytochrome, which would be expected for a constitutive P-450 involved in anabolic biochemical processes."

https://openalex.org/W1545240325,"The kinetics of sodium-independent calcium efflux from liver mitochondria has been studied over the range of calcium loads from 2 to 60 nmol/mg with emphasis on the lower portion of this range. A procedure has been developed through which mitochondria may be depleted of endogenous calcium (initially in the range of 6-10 nmol/mg following preparation) to values as low as 2 nmol/mg, without involving substrate depletion or de-energization. Mitochondria depleted of calcium by this technique are more resistant to the calcium-induced permeability transition than are those depleted by the older procedures and are therefore appropriate for the kinetics studies. Calcium depletion is necessary in studying the kinetics of sodium-independent calcium efflux in order to bring efflux to a rate considerably less than 50% of the saturation rate. The results of these studies show cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.9 +/- 0.2. They have been fit to an equation representative either of a nonessential activation mechanism with a single transport site or of an Adair-Pauling mechanism with two transport sites. From the fit of the data to this equation, a Vmax of 1.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg/min and a concentration of half-maximal activity of 8.4 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg have been obtained. The possible role of phosphate in controlling the Vmax of this transporter has been evaluated by measuring efflux as a function of calcium load at three different concentrations of total inorganic phosphate: 20 microM, 120 microM, and 1 mM. Failure of the maximum transport velocity to decrease with increasing inorganic phosphate indicates that the extreme flatness of the saturation portion of the velocity versus calcium concentration curve observed is not the result of precipitation of calcium with inorganic phosphate but is an inherent property of this efflux mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1550671902,"Adenylate cyclase activity in purified rat adipocyte membranes is stimulated by the calcium- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme protein kinase C. Over the concentration range of 100-1000 milliunits/ml, both highly purified (approximately 3000 units/mg of protein) protein kinase C from rat brain and partially purified (14 units/mg of protein) protein kinase C from guinea pig pancreas stimulate cyclase activity. The actions of both protein kinase C preparations on adenylate cyclase activity are dependent on added calcium, which is effective at concentrations less than 10 microM. Exogenous phospholipids are not required for stimulation of adenylate cyclase by protein kinase C; but, under typical cyclase assay conditions, the adipocyte membranes satisfy the lipid requirement for protein kinase C phosphorylation of histone. The tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate enhances the kinase action on cyclase, and the phorbol ester is effective at concentrations equimolar with the kinase (less than 10 nM). With the brain protein kinase C, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate effects are especially evident at limiting calcium concentrations. Inhibitors of protein kinase C activity, such as chlorpromazine, palmitoylcarnitine, and polymyxin B, inhibit selectively that adenylate cyclase activity which is stimulated by protein kinase C plus calcium. It is concluded that protein kinase C acts directly on the adipocyte adenylate cyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1518655990,"In view of the potential importance of 24,25-epoxysterols as intracellular regulators of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the C-24 epimers of 24,25-oxidolanosterol and 24,25-epoxycholesterol were tested for their biological activity and metabolism in cell cultures. All four compounds produced repression of the reductase in cultured mouse fibroblasts (L cells), and both 24(S)- and 24(R),25-epoxycholesterol exhibited high affinity binding to the cytosolic oxysterol-binding protein. However, binding of the epimeric 24,25-oxidolanosterols was not detected. 24(S),25-Epoxycholesterol was not rapidly metabolized in either L cells or Chinese hamster lung (Dede) cells. 24(S),25-Oxidolanosterol was rapidly converted to 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in both cell lines. 24(R),25-Oxidolanosterol was converted to 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol in Dede cells, but was converted instead to 24(R),25-epoxycholesterol in L cells, which lack sterol delta 24-reductase activity. Although 24(S),25-oxidolanosterol does not appear to accumulate in these cell cultures, it was found in human liver in about one-fifth the amount of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. 24(R),25-Epoxycholesterol was also converted to 24(R)-hydroxycholesterol in Dede cells, but not in L cells. Triparanol inhibited the reduction of the 24(R),25-epoxides in Dede cells, consistent with the idea that this reaction is catalyzed by the delta 24-reductase. 24(R)-Hydroxycholesterol and its 24(S) epimer exhibited affinity for the binding protein and repressed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1556850076,"Binding of glutathione by disulfide linkage to Cys-beta 93 of hemoglobin tetramers within sickle cells increases the oxygen affinity and significantly inhibits sickling at low partial oxygen pressure (Garel, M-C., Domenget, C., Caburi-Martin, J., Prehu, C., Galacteros, F., and Beuzard, Y. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 14704-14709). This article reports a characterization of the oxygen-binding properties of glutathionyl hemoglobin (G-Hb) in solution in the presence or absence of allosteric effectors. The studies reveal a nearly 6-fold increase in oxygen affinity compared to native HbA and a Hill coefficient at half-saturation (n50) of 1.50 compared to n50 of approximately 2.9 for HbA. The oxygen Bohr effect measured in the alkaline pH range is reduced by 38%. Addition of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate decreases the oxygen affinity of G-Hb and HbA to a similar extent and increases the Bohr effect, indicating that the binding sites for organic phosphates are not perturbed in G-Hb. The rate of autooxidation of G-HbO2 is slower than of HbAO2. Oxidation by ferricyanide of G-HbCO is also reduced and is biphasic, demonstrating a heterogeneous susceptibility of the hemes in G-Hb. Flash photolysis experiments indicate that the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant is 1 order of magnitude greater for G-HbCO than for HbACO. High resolution NMR spectra at 400 MHz show that in G-Hb: the tertiary structure of the beta heme pocket is significantly perturbed, particularly in the F helix and the EF corner; the formation of the salt bridge between His-beta 146 and Asp-beta 94, a feature of the deoxy state, is precluded; and a deoxy interchain (alpha 1 beta 2) contact between Asp beta 2 99 and Tyr alpha 1 42 is appreciably destabilized. The NMR data provide a structural basis for interpreting the high oxygen affinity, reduced cooperativity, and diminished polymerization of G-HbS."
https://openalex.org/W1995886797,"Intracellular electrical recordings in an in vitro slice preparation of the brainstem medial pontine reticular formation, a region thought to be important in mediation of desynchronized sleep phenomena, demonstrate a population of neurons that have a calcium-dependent, low threshold spike. This low threshold spike was inactivated at relatively depolarized membrane potential levels and, when this spike was deinactivated, it induced a burst of action potentials. The membrane potential dependence of the spike may underlie changes in action potential firing patterns associated with behavioral state change because the baseline membrane potential in neurons of the medial pontine reticular population depolarizes during passage from waking and slow wave sleep to desynchronized sleep, which is characterized by the absence of burst firing."
https://openalex.org/W1541170918,"The effects of the weak base ammonium chloride on the intracellular transport and sorting of the influenza hemagglutinin to the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells were examined in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Ammonium chloride was found to significantly retard cell surface appearance of the hemagglutinin but to have no effect on either the initial sorting or steady-state levels of hemagglutinin on the apical domain. Based on the rate of acquisition of resistance to endo H, the timed addition of ammonium chloride, and dissociation by reduced temperature incubation of cell surface appearance of the hemagglutinin from early stages of transport and processing, it was determined that the likely site of ammonium chloride action was the trans Golgi."
https://openalex.org/W1530831414,"A hexasaccharide representing a major sequence in porcine mucosal heparin has been enzymatically prepared from heparin. Its structure was determined by an integrated approach using chemical, enzymatic, and spectroscopic methods. Two-dimensional 1H homonuclear COSY, C-H correlation NMR, and selective irradiation were used to assign many of the NMR resonances. In addition, new techniques including sulfate determination by ion chromatography and Fourier transform IR and californium plasma desorption mass spectroscopy have been applied, resulting in an unambiguous structural assignment of delta IdoAp2S(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNp2S6S(1----4)-alpha-L-IdoAp++ +(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNA cp6S-(1----4)-beta-D-GlcAp(1----4)-alpha-D-GlcNp2S3S6S (where delta IdoA represents 4-deoxy-alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid, p represents pyranose, and GlcA and IdoA represent glucuronic and iduronic acid). This hexasaccharide contains a portion of the antithrombin III-binding site and has a Kd of 4 X 10(-5) M. Unlike other small heparin oligosaccharides, which are specific for coagulation factor Xa, it inhibits both factors IIa and Xa equally through antithrombin III. This hexasaccharide may have the unique capacity to act primarily through heparin cofactor II to inhibit thrombin (factor IIa) and shows over half of heparin's heparin cofactor II-mediated anti-factor IIa activity. These studies suggest the occurrence of contiguous binding sites on heparin for Xa, antithrombin III, and heparin cofactor II."

https://openalex.org/W1513437945,"Sphingolipid activator proteins (SAP) are relatively small molecular weight proteins that stimulate the enzymatic hydrolysis of sphingolipids in the presence of specific lysosomal hydrolases. SAP-2 has previously been demonstrated to activate the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide, galactosylceramide, and, possibly, sphingomyelin. Using monospecific rabbit antibodies against human spleen SAP-2, the synthesis and processing of SAP-2 were studied in cultured human fibroblasts. When [35S]methionine was presented in the medium to control human cells for 4 h, five major areas of radiolabeling were found. These had apparent molecular weights of 73,000, 68,000, 50,000, 12,000, and 9,000. Further studies indicated that the major extracellular product in normal cells given NH4Cl along with the [35S]methionine and in medium from cultures from patients with I cell disease had an apparent molecular weight of 73,000. The Mr = 68,000 and 73,000 species can be converted to a species with an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 by the action of endoglycosidase F. After labeling cells for 1 h followed by a 1-h chase, the Mr = 12,000 and 9,000 species appear. Treatment of the immunoprecipitated mixture with endoglycosidase F resulted in conversion of these species to one band with an apparent molecular weight of 7,600. These studies indicate that this relatively low molecular weight protein is rapidly synthesized from a relatively large molecular weight highly glycosylated precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1595702560,"Product and substrate analogs have been employed as inhibitors of the low-molecular-weight phosphatase activity of calcineurin, a calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase. Product inhibition kinetics demonstrate that both products, para-nitrophenol and inorganic phosphate, inhibit para-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis in a competitive manner. Inorganic phosphate is a linear competitive inhibitor, whereas the inhibition by para-nitrophenol is more complex. An analog of para-nitrophenol, pentafluorophenol, was found to be a linear competitive inhibitor. These patterns indicate a rapid equilibrium random kinetic mechanism for calcineurin. This mechanism suggests that calcineurin does not generate a phosphoryl enzyme during its catalytic reaction. Application of sulfate analogs indicates that binding of substrate occurs via the phosphoryl moiety. It is suggested that binding is a function of the affinity of ligand for the metal ion involved in calcineurin action. The dependence of the kinetic parameters of calcineurin upon pH was examined to provide information concerning the role of protonation in the activity and specificity of calcineurin. Log (VM) versus pH data for two low-molecular-weight substrates, para-nitrophenyl phosphate and tyrosine-O-phosphate, reveal a pKa value for the enzyme-substrate complex. Analysis of log (VM/KM) data yields a pKa value for the free enzyme of 8.0. Protonation of the phenolic leaving group during hydrolysis is not the rate-limiting step in calcineurin catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1548079705,"Mass culture of Amoeba proteus enabled us to do biochemical studies on this organism. Actin and profilin were purified from Amoeba to examine actin phosphorylation and polymerization. The apparent molecular weight of Amoeba actin was 44,000, and its isoelectric point was 5.8. The apparent molecular weight of Amoeba profilin was 12,000, and its isoelectric point was 4.9. It reduced the rate of actin polymerization as reported in the cases of profilins from other organisms. A protein of Mr = 44,000 (44 K protein) was phosphorylated in a Ca2+-dependent manner in cell homogenate of Amoeba without being inhibited by calmodulin antagonists. Using the homogenate as a kinase, purified Amoeba G-actin could be phosphorylated in proportion to the amount of actin. However, neither Amoeba F-actin nor rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin was phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of Amoeba actin with a kinase partially purified from A. proteus increased with dilution of the actin concentration. When Amoeba profilin was added, more than 80% of the actin was phosphorylated. By viscometry, electron microscopy, and ultracentrifugation analysis it was demonstrated that Amoeba G-actin phosphorylated in the presence of profilin and kinase did not polymerize in this solution. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that phosphorylated Amoeba actin remained in a monomeric state even under conditions favorable for actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1980950504,"A lectin specific for chito-oligosaccharides from the exudate of ridge gourd (Luffa acutangula) fruits has been purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The lectin has a molecular weight of 48,000, an S(0)20,w of 4.06 S and a Stokes radius of 2.9 nm. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a single band corresponding to Mr of 24,000 was observed both in the presence and absence of beta-mercaptoethanol. The subunits in this dimeric lectin are, therefore, held together solely by noncovalent interactions. The lectin is not a glycoprotein, and secondary structure analysis by CD measurements showed 31% alpha-helix. The hemagglutinating activity of L. acutangula agglutinin was not inhibited by any of the monosaccharides tested. Among the disaccharides only di-N-acetylchitobiose was inhibitory. The inhibitory potency of chito-oligosaccharides increased dramatically with their size up to penta-N-acetylchitopentaose. The lectin has two binding sites for saccharides. The affinity of chito-oligosaccharides for L. acutangula lectin, as monitored by titrating the changes in the near UV-CD spectra and intrinsic fluorescence, increased strikingly with the number of GlcNAc units in them. The values of delta G, delta H, and delta S for the binding process showed a pronounced dependence on the size of the chito-oligosaccharides, indicating that the binding of higher oligomers is progressively more favored thermodynamically than di-N-acetylchitobiose. The thermodynamic data are consistent with an extended binding site in this lectin, which accommodates a tetrasaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1613892139,"Formaldehyde dehydrogenases isolated from several different biological sources have been reported to catalyze the NAD+-dependent oxidative acylation of glutathione by methylglyoxal to form S-pyruvylglutathione, suggesting the involvement of this enzyme in the metabolism of methylglyoxal. However, formaldehyde dehydrogenase from bovine liver is found not to use methylglyoxal or related alpha-ketoaldehydes as substrates. Using methylglyoxal with the enzyme under conditions favoring the forward reaction did not result in the formation of S-pyruvylglutathione. Using independently synthesized S-pyruvylglutathione with the enzyme under conditions favoring the reverse reaction did not result in the production of methylglyoxal. In addition, methylglyoxal and several related alpha-ketoaldehydes did not exhibit detectable activity with formaldehyde dehydrogenase partially purified from human liver, contrary to a previous report. Some, if not all, past reports that methylglyoxal serves as a substrate for the dehydrogenase may be due to the demonstrated presence of contaminating formaldehyde in some commercially available preparations of methylglyoxal. In a related study, S-hydroxymethylglutathione, formed by pre-equilibrium addition of formaldehyde to glutathione, is concluded to be direct substrate for the dehydrogenase. This follows from the observation that the catalytic turnover number of the enzyme in the forward direction exceeds by a factor of approximately 20 the first order rate constant for decomposition of S-hydroxymethylglutathione to glutathione and formaldehyde (k = 5.03 +/- 0.30 min-1, pH 8, 25 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W106415194,"The 19,000-dalton light chain (LC2) can be completely and reversibly removed from chicken pectoralis myosin in 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM ATP using immunoaffinity chromatography at 37 degrees C. Earlier methods have led to only partial removal of LC2 or have caused limited degradation of the heavy chain. Electron microscopy of LC2-deficient myosin showed it to have a marked tendency to aggregate into oligomers through the neck region of the myosin head. Myosin reverted to the monomeric form when it was reconstituted with light chains. LC2-deficient myosin retained full K+ (EDTA) or Ca2+-ATPase activity, and the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase was similar to that of the native molecule. Alkali light chain exchange at 37 degrees C, which has been demonstrated in subfragment 1 prepared with chymotrypsin, does not occur with intact myosin molecules or with papain subfragment 1, both of which contain LC2. However, a temperature-dependent exchange of alkali light chains was observed in myosin lacking LC2. The interaction of the alkali light chain with the heavy chain thus appears to be influenced by the presence of LC2, which may have an important stabilizing effect on the myosin molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2161976915,"Cleavage of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by isolated Kupffer cells from rat liver was examined. Iodinated PTH labeled at position 43 was converted into two radioactive fragments which were shown by Edman degradation to have residues 35 and 38 as their NH2 termini. Cleavage at these positions is characteristic of cathepsin D. Amino-terminal fragments were detected by bioassay of fractions obtained by high performance liquid chromatography. These fragments eluted in positions characteristic of the 1-34 and 1-37 peptides also previously shown to be produced by purified cathepsin D. The putative 1-37 fragment was rapidly converted to 1-34 upon digestion with cathepsin D, whereas the putative 1-34 fragment was not further digested by this enzyme, behavior previously shown to be characteristic of 1-37 and 1-34 bovine PTH. Fragmentation of PTH as measured by generation of fragments soluble in trichloroacetic acid was inhibited by methylamine, monensin, and ammonium chloride. In addition, monensin significantly inhibited production of both carboxyl- and amino-terminal fragments. Finally, active PTH fragments were also produced by elicited peritoneal macrophages. It is concluded that Kupffer cells, and other macrophages, can produce active fragments of PTH which appear in the medium. These fragments may be generated by cathepsin D within the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569051084,"5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme formed when Arthrobacter Cr-7 is grown with pyridoxine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was purified about 190-fold to homogeneity from fully induced cells. The enzyme catalyzes Reaction a, (Formula: see text) the essential ring-opening step in the degradation of pyridoxine, and provides a second example of an FAD-dependent oxygenase that adds both two hydrogen and two oxygen atoms to its substrate. 5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase has an isoelectric point of 4.6, functions optimally between pH 7 and 8, appears to contain a single subunit of Mr = 51,000 and one FAD (but no iron) per subunit, and is readily resolved by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at pH 3.0. FMN and riboflavin do not replace FAD as coenzyme, but their presence enhances a normally minor side reaction (Reaction b) NAD(P)H + H+ + O2----NAD(P)+ + H2O2 (b) catalyzed by the holoenzyme. Reaction b also is enhanced when the poorly utilized analogues, 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylic acid or NADH, replace 5-pyridoxic acid or NADPH, respectively, as substrates in Reaction a. Each of the enzymes required in two different pathways for degradation of pyridoxine to anabolic intermediates has now been studied. A comparison of these two pathways and their enzymes is provided."
https://openalex.org/W1606366915,"Acivicin (NSC 163501) and dichloroallyl lawsone (NSC 126771) are potent inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis with consequent anti-cancer activity against certain experimental tumors. To determine in detail the metabolic events induced by each inhibitor, we have devised a new two-dimensional chromatographic procedure for measurement of the concentrations of all pyrimidine intermediates and some purine nucleotides from 100 microliter of an extract of cells grown in the presence of [14C]bicarbonate. Addition of acivicin (25 microM) to mouse L1210 leukemia cells causes severe depletion in the cellular levels of CTP and GTP, accumulation of uridine nucleotides, and abrupt but transient increases in the concentrations of the early intermediates of both the pyrimidine and purine pathways. Addition of dichloroallyl lawsone (25 microM) results in a rapid depletion of uridine and cytidine nucleotides; carbamyl aspartate and dihydroorotate accumulate to high levels in an equilibrium ratio of 20.5:1, and orotate, orotidine, and UMP increase transiently before decreasing to levels approaching their original steady states. The predominant inhibitory effects of acivicin are upon the reactions UTP----CTP and XMP----GMP, but there is also an initial transient activation of both the pyrimidine and purine pathways by acivicin. The data obtained with dichloroallyl lawsone are consistent with inhibition of the conversion of UMP----UDP initially followed by potent inhibition of dihydroorotate----orotate."
https://openalex.org/W1564630428,"The mechanism of pantothenate transport into rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles was studied. Under voltage-clamped conditions, an inward NaCl gradient induced the transient accumulation of pantothenate against its concentration gradient, indicating Na+/pantothenate cotransport. K+, Rb+, Li+, NH4+, and choline+ were ineffective in replacing Na+. Pantothenate analogs, D-glucose, and various carboxylic acids did not inhibit Na+-dependent pantothenate transport, suggesting that this system is specific for pantothenate. Kinetic analysis of the Na+-dependent pantothenate uptake revealed a single transport system which obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 16 microM and Vmax = 6.7 pmol X mg-1 X 10 s-1). Imposition of an inside-negative membrane potential caused net uphill pantothenate accumulation in the presence of Na+ but absence of a Na+ gradient, indicating that Na+/pantothenate cotransport is electrogenic. The relationship between extravesicular Na+ concentration and pantothenate transport measured under voltage-clamped conditions was sigmoidal: a Hill coefficient (napp) of 2 and a [Na+]0.5 of 55 mM were calculated. It is suggested that an anionic pantothenate1- molecule is cotransported with two Na+ to give a net charge of +1. The coupling of pantothenate transport to the Na+ electrochemical gradient may provide an efficient mechanism for reabsorption of pantothenate in the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1599350036,"An FAD-containing L-alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase has been purified to homogeneity from Streptococcus faecium. The purified protein exists as a dimer (subunit Mr = 65,000); each subunit contains 1 mol of FAD. The enzyme contains no iron, as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The alpha-glycerophosphate oxidase reacts reversibly with sulfite to form a covalent N(5) adduct; it preferentially binds the anionic form of the native oxidized FAD, and it also stabilizes the p-quinonoid form of 8-mercapto-FAD. The enzyme shows an unusually high reactivity with ferricyanide in the absence of oxygen; however, there is no evidence for any superoxide ion (O2-.) generation under standard assay conditions. Dithionite titrations of the enzyme reveal an unusual pH dependence for the stabilization of the flavin semiquinone; only at pH 8.5 does significant anionic semiquinone accumulate. L-alpha-Glycerophosphate rapidly reduces the enzyme-bound FAD; in addition, a small amount of catalytically insignificant red semiquinone appears under these conditions. The 5-deaza-FAD-reconstituted enzyme is also reduced by substrate, strongly suggesting that a radical mechanism is not involved in the oxidation of alpha-glycerophosphate. Furthermore, nitroethane anion reduces the native enzyme; this observation suggests that an electron transfer mechanism involving a substrate carbanion is possible with this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1591854647,"3-Hydroxyacyl coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase-binding protein was solubilized from inner mitochondrial membrane by using taurodeoxycholate at high ionic strength. The binding protein was isolated from the suspension using 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase affinity chromatography. The protein eluted from the affinity column had a molecular weight of approximately 150,000, as determined by gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the protein is a dimer consisting of 69,000 and 71,000 molecular weight subunits. The enzyme binding capacity of this protein was tested with a polyethylene glycol precipitation method: 0.5 mg of enzyme could be precipitated together with 1 mg of binding protein, showing that 1 mol of binding protein binds 1 mol of enzyme. This protein had no affinity toward malic dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and fumarase. The approximately 2-fold increase in the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity when it was measured in the presence of the binding protein is additional evidence of enzyme-binding protein interaction. When incorporated into liposomes, the binding protein retained its ability to bind 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, but did not bind malic dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and fumarase. These results suggest that the protein isolated by us has a specific function in anchoring a beta-oxidation enzyme to the matrix surface of the mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1487535219,"Abstract We have studied the binding equilibria of the membrane-bound acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata with representative cholinergic ligands by means of two fluorescence and a rapid centrifugation assay. Based on the established mechanism of acetylcholine binding to the receptor (Fels, G., Wolff, E. K., and Maelicke, A. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 127, 31-38), the obtained binding and competition data were analyzed assuming two classes of interacting sites for all ligands studied. The experimental data were consistent with this assumption and, based on the obtained KD values, suggest weak positively cooperative interactions of binding sites when occupied by agonists but independent (or negatively cooperative interacting) sites when occupied by antagonists. Based on the fluorescence binding assay employed, agonists and antagonists induce different conformational states of the liganded receptor. These states seem to be similar for all antagonists tested but differ for the different agonists tested. The existence of ligand-specific conformational states suggests a close link of these states with receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1492208261,"The perturbations of the conformation of human deoxyhemoglobin induced by the covalent attachment of glutathione at cysteine beta 93 have been investigated by computer simulation in conjunction with molecular graphics. In the first phase of the analysis, a systematic search was carried out of the conformational space of glutathione attached to deoxyhemoglobin. In this search, the conformation of the hemoglobin molecule was held constant, while the relative energies of a series of 186,624 glutathione conformations involving systematic variation of six dihedral angels were calculated. From this search, the most favorable conformation was selected as the starting conformation for energy minimization of the glutathionyl hemoglobin molecule as a function of all Cartesian coordinates. In order to provide a reference state, an independent minimization by the same procedures was carried out for deoxyhemoglobin in the absence of glutathione. Comparison of the minimized structures with and without glutathione attached revealed a number of significant differences. The most conspicuous difference in the protein moiety concerned the salt bridge between aspartate beta 94 and histidine beta 146 which is destabilized upon minimization of the glutathionyl-hemoglobin complex due to interactions of the aspartate residue with the glycyl NH group of glutathione. Other observed differences in the minimized structures are located at the alpha 1-beta 2 interface and include displacement of the carboxyl group of aspartate beta 99. In the minimized complex, the glutathione portion assumes a quasi-cyclic conformation stabilized through interactions between the free (gamma-glutamyl) amino and (glycyl) carboxyl ends of the tripeptide and between this carboxyl end and the epsilon amino group of lysine alpha 40. In a parallel conformational study of glutathione alone, a similar structure was found as the lowest energy form. These quasi-cyclic conformations contrast with the extended structures reported by Wright (Wright, W.B. (1955) Acta Crystallogr. 11, 632-642) for crystals of glutathione where interactions between molecules play a major role. The conclusions of our analysis are in agreement with the experimental investigations reported in the two preceding papers and permit, moreover, a coherent interpretation of the observed functional and structural changes in deoxyhemoglobin induced by glutathione."

Hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azido-benzoate was used to photochemically cross-link [3H] cytochalasin B to the glucose transporter in isolated surface membranes and plasma membrane vesicles of L. donovani promastigotes. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the covalently labeled glucose transporter migrated as a 20-30-kDa protein band. This band was eluted from SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently analyzed by isoelectric focusing. The latter revealed two major peaks focusing at pH 6.8 and 6.6 [3H]Cytochalasin B-labeled membrane activity was detergent-solubilized, bound to concanavalin A-agarose beads, and specifically eluted with alpha-methyl mannoside. Analysis of the eluted material by SDS-PAGE revealed a D-glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin B peak with an apparent Mr approximately 20,000. The cumulative results indicate that the glucose transporter of L. donovani promastigotes is a glycoprotein which contains mannose as its major carbohydrate constituent."

The mechanism proposed for participation of these cations in the enzyme reaction involves an ordered addition, with the binding of cation preceding the binding of the amide substrate. On the other hand, the kinetic properties of this same activation by Na+ are consistent with either two cation sites, or classes of sites, of importance. Once again, however, the mechanism of the reaction appears to be of the ordered type, with cation binding occurring prior to substrate binding."

It has a pH optimum of 7.0, a Km of 5.9 microM, and a Vmax at 25 degrees C of 35.2 mumol X min-1 X mg-1. 5-Pyridoxolactonase from Arthrobacter Cr-7 has an Mr of 65,200 and also contains two probably identical subunits of Mr = 32,800.

The two lactonases require no added cofactors or metal ions; their activities are inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents but are not affected by metal-chelating reagents. Although the two lactonases are entirely specific for their respective substrates, 4-pyridoxolactone is a competitive inhibitor (KI = 52 microM) for 5-pyridoxolactonase, and 5-pyridoxolactone is a competitive inhibitor (KI = 48 microM) for 4-pyridoxolactonase."
https://openalex.org/W1510200617,"The mechanism of association of the human platelet membrane GPIIb-GPIIIa-Ca2+ complex was studied by treating solubilized membranes with various enzymes and cationic peptides and by studying the binding of 45Ca2+ and 125I-fibrinogen before and after dissociation with EGTA and association with Ca2+. Neuraminidase shifted the complex cathodally (presumably due to cleavage of negatively charged domains), whereas trypsin had no such effect. The EGTA-dissociated complex was almost completely reassociated with neuraminidase or the cationic peptide, tetralysine. The monoclonal antibody 10E5, which specifically binds to the Ca2+-associated complex (not to its dissociated components), also bound to the neuraminidase-associated complex. Thus, Ca2+ is not necessary for the association of the complex. Neuraminidase treatment of washed intact platelets resulted in a cathodal shift of the membrane Triton X-100-extracted associated complex with no effect on its ability to dissociate in the presence of EGTA. Neuraminidase treatment of ADP-perturbed washed platelets also resulted in a cathodal shift of the associated complex; however, dissociation with EGTA was inhibited. Thus, critical neuraminidase-sensitive components of the complex (sialic acid residues) are not exposed on the surface of the platelet membrane of resting platelets, but do become accessible following platelet stimulation with ADP or membrane solubilization with Triton X-100. 45Ca2+ bound to the associated complex, to GPIIb of the dissociated complex (not to GPIIIa), to the Ca2+-reassociated complex, and to the neuraminidase-associated complex which had been dissociated with EGTA. Thus, neuraminidase-sensitive components of the solubilized membrane are not required for Ca2+ binding. 125I-fibrinogen bound to the associated complex (not the dissociated complex), to the Ca2+-reassociated complex, and to the neuraminidase-reassociated complex which had been dissociated with EGTA. Thus, Ca2+ is not necessary for 125I-fibrinogen binding to the major antigen complex."

Chloroperoxidase synthesis is controlled at the mRNA level. Glucose strongly represses production of chloroperoxidase mRNA and protein, whereas fructose induces both to high levels. Chloroperoxidase has been partially sequenced by automated Edman degradation of tryptic peptides. Based on this amino acid sequence data, a 2-fold degenerate, 29-base oligonucleotide (29-mer) complementary to chloroperoxidase mRNA was synthesized. Polyadenylated RNA, purified from C. fumago, was used as substrate for cDNA synthesis using the 29-mer as primer. cDNAs were made double-stranded and cloned into plasmid pBR322 by conventional methods. Screening the resultant cDNA bank by colony hybridization with the 29-mer as probe showed that 18% of the clones contained the 29-mer sequence. Dideoxy sequencing of one clone (pMA340) identified it as part of the coding region for chloroperoxidase by comparison with known amino acid sequences. In addition, the amino-terminal coding region of clone pMA340 reveals a putative signal peptide for chloroperoxidase. Clone pMA340 was then used in Northern analysis of chloroperoxidase mRNA levels under conditions which induce and repress enzyme secretion."
