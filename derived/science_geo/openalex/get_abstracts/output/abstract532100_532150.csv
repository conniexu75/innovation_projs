To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the re-establishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability. Our study reveals that CRC cells can revert to functioning normal cells given appropriate signals and provide compelling in vivo validation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target for treatment of CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in developed countries, and almost half of the population will develop at least one benign intestinal tumor during their lifetime (Jemal et al., 2011Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30255) Google Scholar). Treatment regimes for advanced CRC involve combination chemotherapies that are toxic and largely ineffective, yet have remained the backbone of therapy over the last decade. Molecularly, the vast majority (∼80%–90%) of colorectal tumors contain inactivating mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor (Brannon et al., 2014Brannon A.R. Vakiani E. Sylvester B.E. Scott S.N. McDermott G. Shah R.H. Kania K. Viale A. Oschwald D.M. Vacic V. et al.Comparative sequencing analysis reveals high genomic concordance between matched primary and metastatic colorectal cancer lesions.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 454Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and individuals with specific germline mutations in APC (familial adenomatous polyposis or FAP) invariably develop colon cancer before the age of 35. Collectively, APC mutant CRC accounts for more than 600,000 deaths annually worldwide, a number greater than KRAS mutant lung or pancreas cancer. Hence, strategies to exploit APC alterations in CRC have broad clinical potential. APC regulates a number of cellular functions, including mitosis, migration, and the maintenance of genome stability (Nelson and Näthke, 2013Nelson S. Näthke I.S. Interactions and functions of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Most importantly, APC, along with AXIN1 and GSK3β, is part of a multi-protein complex that controls output of the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the sub-cellular localization and stability of CTNNB1 (β-catenin), a key transcriptional regulator that drives Wnt signaling output. APC inactivation is considered the initiating event in most CRCs, and Apc loss is sufficient to induce benign and dysplastic adenomas in the small and large mouse intestine (Cheung et al., 2010Cheung A.F. Carter A.M. Kostova K.K. Woodruff J.F. Crowley D. Bronson R.T. Haigis K.M. Jacks T.

ApcMin (Multiple Intestinal Neoplasia) mice carry a single mutant Apc allele and develop 50–100 benign adenomas in the small intestine by 4–6 months of age, invariably associated with loss of the remaining wild-type gene (Su et al., 1992Su L.K. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Preisinger A.C. Moser A.R. Luongo C. Gould K.A. Dove W.F. Multiple intestinal neoplasia caused by a mutation in the murine homolog of the APC gene.Science. 1992; 256: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Conditional Apc truncation drives a similar neoplastic phenotype, associated with hyperproliferation, reduced multi-lineage differentiation, disrupted tissue structure, and an expansion of intestinal stem cells outside the crypt domain (Barker et al., 2009Barker N. Ridgway R. van Es J. van de Wetering M. Begthel H. van den Born M. Danenberg E. Clarke A. Sansom O. Clevers H.

Nathke I.S. et al.Loss of Apc in vivo immediately perturbs Wnt signaling, differentiation, and migration.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Besides APC disruption, CRCs show a high incidence of mutations in KRAS (45%) and TP53 (54%) that cooperate to drive tumor progression (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5904) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent large-scale sequencing efforts have cataloged additional genetic changes that likely influence disease progression (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkComprehensive molecular characterization of human colon and rectal cancer.Nature. 2012; 487: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (5904) Google Scholar). Still, little is known about which, if any, of these alterations are required for maintenance of established disease and continued malignant progression. Indeed, it remains unclear whether APC disruption, the predominant CRC-associated event, is required for maintenance of CRC and thus whether hyperactivated Wnt signaling is a viable therapeutic target. To address this question, we generated shRNA transgenic mice that enable conditional and reversible control of Apc expression by TRE-regulated, GFP-linked short-hairpin RNAs (TG-shRNAs) (Dow et al., 2012Dow L.E. Premsrirut P.K. Zuber J. Fellmann C. McJunkin K. Miething C. Park Y. Dickins R.A. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. A pipeline for the generation of shRNA transgenic mice.Nat.

Kogan S.C. et al.A rapid and scalable system for studying gene function in mice using conditional RNA interference.Cell. 2011; 145: 145-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In mice that also express a reverse tet-transactivator (rtTA), doxycycline (dox) administration drives GFP expression and Apc silencing, and subsequent dox withdrawal results in restoration of endogenous Apc expression. Our work demonstrates a crucial role for Apc loss in CRC maintenance and reveals an unexpected ability of Apc to re-establish control of crypt homeostasis in animals with hyperproliferative polyps or cancer. Collectively, our results validate the APC/WNT pathway is an attractive target for the treatment of CRC. Acute genetic disruption of Apc in the intestine drives hyperproliferation and expansion of undifferentiated progenitor cells (Sansom et al., 2004Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. et al.Loss of Apc in vivo immediately perturbs Wnt signaling, differentiation, and migration.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This results in the disruption of the crypt-villus axis, whereby stem and progenitor cells, normally restricted to the crypt base, expand and fail to differentiate as they move up the villus (Sansom et al., 2004Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. et al.Loss of Apc in vivo immediately perturbs Wnt signaling, differentiation, and migration.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). To assess how shRNA-mediated Apc suppression affects crypt-villus homeostasis, we examined Wnt pathway activation in the intestinal epithelium in multiple Apc shRNA strains (TG-Apc.3374 and TG-Apc.9365) (Premsrirut et al., 2011Premsrirut P.K. Dow L.E. Kim S.Y. Camiolo M. Malone C.D. Miething C. Scuoppo C. Zuber J. Dickins R.A. Kogan S.C. et al.A rapid and scalable system for studying gene function in mice using conditional RNA interference.Cell. 2011; 145: 145-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). We observed that only the most potent suppression of Apc (TG-Apc.3374) caused an increase in non-phosphorylated β-catenin in the intestine (Figure S1A). This response was further amplified with a CAGs-rtTA3 transgene, driving greater Apc knockdown and more than 20-fold transcriptional induction of the canonical Wnt target Axin2 (Figures S1A and S1B). To examine the intestinal response to Apc silencing, we treated TG-Apc.3374 (hereafter, shApc) animals with dox and monitored their weight as a surrogate measure of intestinal function. After 6 days of dox treatment shApc animals began to show signs of weight loss relative to neutral TG-shRen.713 (shRen) controls (Zuber et al., 2011Zuber J. McJunkin K. Fellmann C. Dow L.E. Taylor M.J. Hannon G.J. Lowe S.W. Toolkit for evaluating genes required for proliferation and survival using tetracycline-regulated RNAi.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and by day 10, shApc mice were lethargic and moribund (Figure 1A). Depletion of Apc caused a marked expansion of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and keratin 20 (Krt20) negative progenitors and hyperproliferation throughout the crypt-villus axis (Figure 1B). The block in differentiation and expansion of stem and progenitor cells was further confirmed by the identification of lysozyme-positive Paneth cells and Lgr5 and Olfm4-positive stem cells outside their normal position at the base of the crypt (Figure 1B). Apc silencing induced a progressive increase in the expression of canonical Wnt targets, including Axin2 and cMyc, as well as markers of intestinal stem cells Lgr5 and Ascl2 (Figures 1C and 1D). Importantly, a second transgenic strain harboring an independent and potent Apc shRNA (TG-Apc.2235E) produced identical phenotypes (Figure 1A, Figure S1C). These data demonstrate that shRNA-driven Apc silencing can recapitulate the conditional knockout phenotype (Sansom et al., 2004Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. et al.Loss of Apc in vivo immediately perturbs Wnt signaling, differentiation, and migration.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to genetic deletions, shRNAs suppress gene function in trans, and, as such, the endogenous protein can be restored simply by eliminating shRNA expression. To assess whether Apc restoration could rescue the intestinal dysfunction, we treated shApc mice for 10 days and then withdrew dox from the diet. Apc restoration induced a rapid and dramatic phenotypic response, and by 8 days the mice recovered to their original weight (Figure 1A). Within 2 days of dox withdrawal, GFP-shRNA transcription from the TRE promoter was reduced more than 100-fold and by 4 days had returned almost to baseline levels (Figure 1C). Remarkably, 4 days of dox withdrawal was sufficient to restore crypt-villus homeostasis as evidenced by basal localization of proliferative stem and progenitor cells and lysozyme+ Paneth cells, while differentiated markers (AP, Krt20) were strongly expressed throughout the villus (Figure 1B). Accordingly, a decrease in levels of Wnt-responsive mRNAs, as well as Myc protein, were apparent as early as 2 days after dox withdrawal and returned to baseline by 4 days (Figures 1C and 1D). Together these data show that acute Apc suppression recapitulates the phenotypes of Apc deletion and, importantly, that restoration of endogenous Apc expression can recover normal intestinal function. The above results are striking and highlight the utility of inducible shRNA transgenic mice to study the reversibility of loss of function phenotypes. However, these models are not ideal for studying cancer, as tissue-wide Apc suppression produces lethality well before mice develop intestinal tumors. Moreover, tumorigenesis in humans initiates from individual mutated cells surrounded by otherwise normal tissue. To address this, we modeled mosaic Apc loss by combining a stem cell restricted 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible CreER strain (Lgr5-GFP-IRES-CreER, hereafter Lgr5-CreER) (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) with a Cre-dependent R26-CAGs-LSL-rtTA3 (LSL-rtTA3) strain that we recently generated (Dow et al., 2014Dow L.E. Nasr Z. Saborowski M. Ebbesen S.H. Manchado E. Tasdemir N. Lee T. Pelletier J. Lowe S.W. Conditional reverse tet-transactivator mouse strains for the efficient induction of TRE-regulated transgenes in mice.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e95236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In these mice, a single treatment with 4OHT initiates LoxP-recombination in stem cells of the small and large intestine, inducing long-lived, rtTA3 expression in a small percentage of individual crypts and villi (Figures S2A and S2B). In LSL-rtTA3 / Lgr5-CreER / TG-Ren.713 (shRen/Lgr5) control mice treated with 4OHT and dox we observed GFP induction in individual crypts and villi throughout the length of the small intestine and colon for up to 40 weeks (Figure S2C, data not shown). Of note, the shRNA linked GFP reporter is significantly more abundant than GFP expressed from the Lgr5-GFP-IRES-CreER knockin allele and can be used as a surrogate marker of shRNA expression and Apc knockdown. Next, we generated LSL-rtTA3 / Lgr5-CreER / shApc (shApc/Lgr5) mice and monitored tumor development longitudinally by small animal colonoscopy. Four-to-six weeks following 4OHT/dox treatment, we noted the development of macroscopic polyps in the small intestine and colon (Figure 2A, Figure S3). By 12–16 weeks, shApc/Lgr5 mice developed large colonic polyps that appeared histologically as well-differentiated tubular adenomas. As is characteristic of tumors initiated by mutations in Apc, polyps arising in shApc/Lgr5 animals showed a massive increase in proliferation, marked by BrdU incorporation (Figure 2B). These lesions also carried reduced numbers of Krt20+ enterocytes and Alcian blue+ goblet cells and showed a significant increase in Lgr5+ stem cells outside of their normal position at the crypt base (Figure 2B, Figure S3). Together, these data highlight a block in the production of differentiated cell types and an expansion of the stem and progenitor compartment.Figure S3Apc Restoration Drives Regression of Small Intestinal Adenomas, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Left: Longitudinal colonoscopic images of a dox-treated shApc/Lgr5 mouse, as indicated, and following 4, 8 and 13 weeks of dox withdrawal.

In line with previous observations in ApcMin animals (Moser et al., 1990Moser A.R. Pitot H.C. Dove W.F. A dominant mutation that predisposes to multiple intestinal neoplasia in the mouse.Science. 1990; 247: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), shApc/Lgr5 mice treated with 4OHT displayed a progressive decrease in hematocrit, associated with blood loss following polyp development (Figure 2C), and a median survival of 115 days (Figure 2D). However, in contrast to Apcfl/fl/Lgr5 (and ApcMin) animals that developed disease almost exclusively in the small intestine, concentrated in the distal jejunum and ileum (Figure 2E), tumors in shApc/Lgr5 mice arose in the colon and duodenum/proximal jejunum (Figures 2E and 2F), which more closely reflects the anatomy of disease presentation in FAP patients (Sarre et al., 1987Sarre R.G. Frost A.G. Jagelman D.G. Petras R.E. Sivak M.V. McGannon E. Gastric and duodenal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis: a prospective study of the nature and prevalence of upper gastrointestinal polyps.Gut. 1987; 28: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This regional difference in tumor distribution was not due to the restricted activation of Cre, or doxycycline treatment, as we observed Cre recombination (GFP induction) throughout the small intestine and colon (Figure S2C), and both ApcMin and Apcfl/fl/Lgr5-CreER mice were treated with dox from 5–6 weeks of age. Regardless of the precise mechanism, the appearance of colorectal disease enabled longitudinal studies of disease progression and/or regression in live mice using small animal endoscopy. To examine the molecular characteristics of colonic adenomas formed in shApc/Lgr5 mice, we performed gene expression analysis by RNAseq and identified 3,225 (1,339 up, 1,886 down) genes that were significantly deregulated (2-fold or greater) relative to shRen/Lgr5 control mucosa. This expression signature was enriched for both up and downregulated transcripts identified in human colorectal cancers (Stages I-IV, FDR < .001) (Figure 2G, Figure S2D) (Ongen et al., 2014Ongen H. Andersen C.L. Bramsen J.B. Oster B. Rasmussen M.H. Ferreira P.G. Sandoval J. Vidal E. Whiffin N. Planchon A. et al.Putative cis-regulatory drivers in colorectal cancer.Nature. 2014; 512: 87-90PubMed Google Scholar) as well as human colon adenomas (FDR < .001) (Figure S2D) (Sabates-Bellver et al., 2007Sabates-Bellver J. Van der Flier L.G. de Palo M. Cattaneo E. Maake C. Rehrauer H. Laczko E. Kurowski M.A. Bujnicki J.M. Menigatti M. et al.Transcriptome profile of human colorectal adenomas.Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). shApc/Lgr5 tumors also contained an overrepresentation of transcripts found in purified Lgr5+ stem cells and enterocyte progenitors (FDR < .001) and an underrepresentation of genes exclusively expressed in secretory progenitors or enterocytes (Figure S2D and Table S1) (Kim et al., 2014Kim T.H. Li F. Ferreiro-Neira I. Ho L.L. Luyten A. Nalapareddy K. Long H. Verzi M. Shivdasani R.A. Broadly permissive intestinal chromatin underlies lateral inhibition and cell plasticity.Nature. 2014; 506: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Further, shApc/Lgr5 colon tumors showed a decrease in Krt20 (Figure 2B) and Slc26a3 expression (Figure 2G, bottom), which together, define a two-gene classifier that is associated with poor prognosis in human CRC (Dalerba et al., 2011Dalerba P. Kalisky T. Sahoo D. Rajendran P.S. Rothenberg M.E. Leyrat A.A. Sim S. Okamoto J. Johnston D.M. Qian D. et al.Single-cell dissection of transcriptional heterogeneity in human colon tumors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, the gene expression profile of shApc/Lgr5 tumors is consistent with our histological analyses and indicates that Apc suppression impairs differentiation and drives the expansion of progenitor cells. In all, the histological, anatomical, and molecular characteristics of colon adenomas formed in shApc/Lgr5 mice suggest they accurately reflect the early stages of human colorectal cancer. We next asked whether sustained Apc loss was essential for disease maintenance by restoring endogenous Apc protein expression in established polyps of shApc/Lgr5 mice. The tumor response to dox withdrawal was striking: in the colon, longitudinal endoscopic imaging of dox-withdrawn animals showed rapid regression of polyps over many weeks (Figure 3A, Figure S3A). Small intestinal polyps regressed even more rapidly, and indeed, no macroscopic polyps were visible in the small intestine after two weeks of Apc restoration (Figure S3C). In some cases, we noted the persistence of small polyp-like masses visible in the colon for weeks following dox withdrawal (Figure S3A, arrows). While abnormal in structure, these masses were composed of histologically normal, differentiated epithelium (Figure S3A, right), perhaps retained due to irreversible changes in tissue structure or fibrosis during tumor growth. As expected, the marked response to Apc reactivation was associated with a corresponding decrease in Wnt target gene expression (Figure 3D). However, in contrast to studies showing forced overexpression of APC in tumor cells can promote apoptosis (Morin et al., 1996Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Apoptosis and APC in colorectal tumorigenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), endogenous Apc produced no increase in apoptotic cell death as measured by histology and lack of cleaved-Caspase 3 staining (Figure 3C, Figure S3C). Instead, Apc restoration was associated with rapid cell-cycle arrest and massive differentiation. Specifically, within 4 days following dox withdrawal, almost all tumor cells had ceased proliferation (Figure 3B, Figure S3B), showed a dramatic increase in Krt20 expression, and a decrease in Lgr5+ stem cells within the polyp (Figure 3C, Figure S3C). The tumor suppressive effect of Apc was potent, and indeed, we have never observed relapsed disease in the small intestine or colon in mice monitored up to 6 months following Apc restoration (n = 13, Figure 3E). The rapid differentiation response of cells within adenomas prompted us to explore if any Apc-restored cells remained at the site of the regressed adenoma or if they were eliminated as differentiated epithelial tissue. In our model, bright GFP expression marks Cre-recombined cells that express a dox-dependent shRNA, however, following dox withdrawal, GFP expression is lost. To identify any remaining tumor cells 2 weeks following Apc restoration, we pulsed mice with dox for 2 days (Figure 4A). Importantly, 2 days is sufficient time to induce GFP expression and thus “lineage trace” Cre-recombined cells, but not long enough to produce a hyperproliferative response to Apc silencing (Figure 4B, “shApc - naive label”). GFP re-labeling in control (shRen/Lgr5) mice revealed entirely GFP-positive crypts, indicating the presence of long-lived, Cre-recombined stem cells that contribute continually to the normal mucosa (Figure 4B, “shRen re-label”). In regressing adenomas, we noted similar GFP “ribbons” extending from the crypt base to the outer differentiated epithelium (Figure 4B, “shApc re-label”). GFP-positive regions appeared histologically similar to GFP-negative neighboring crypts, containing markers of differentiated enterocytes (Krt20 and Villin) and Goblet cells (Muc2 and Alcian blue) (Figure 4B, Figure S4).Figure S4Apc Restoration Re-establishes Goblet Cell Differentiation, Related to Figure 4Show full captionImmunohistochemical (H&E and Alcian blue) stains showing an shApc/Lgr5 polyp pulsed with dox for 2 days after 2 weeks of dox withdrawal.

Krt20/GFP stained image of the same polyp is shown in Figure 4. Apc-restored cells retained within regressed tumors maintained the potential for tumor growth and 10 weeks following re-silencing of Apc, regressed polyps had regrown to their original size (Figure 4C). We repeated the cycle, this time maintaining the animals off dox for 15 weeks, and again all tumors showed regression and subsequent regrowth at their original sites (Figure 4C). Thus, Apc restoration in colorectal polyps not only triggers differentiation, but also restores normal homeostasis in crypt based columnar cells, even after multiple rounds of tumorigenic growth and regression. The in vivo experiments described above provide a clear demonstration that Apc restored cells can re-establish normal behavior; however, closely following cell fate and differentiation capacity longitudinally in a complex tissue is challenging. Ex vivo intestinal crypt culture (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar) provides a means to directly interrogate cellular response to Apc in the absence of a complex microenvironment. To ask whether Apc-restored cells could reestablish the balance of self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation without cues from surrounding normal tissue, we derived small intestinal crypt cultures from shApc mice and examined their behavior following the addition and withdrawal of dox. Consistent with studies using Apc mutant organoids (Sato et al., 2011Sato T. Stange D.E. Ferrante M. Vries R.G. Van Es J.H. Van den Brink S. Van Houdt W.J. Pronk A. Van Gorp J. Siersema P.D.

Like shApc-driven adenomas, spheroids showed a significant increase in proliferation, a block in differentiation (marked by loss of Krt20, Alk Phos and Muc2-positive cells) and loss of crypt-like projections containing Paneth cells (Figure 5A).

https://openalex.org/W1901404250,"The synthesis of type I collagen, the main component of bone matrix, precedes the expression of Runx2, the earliest determinant of osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesized that the energetic needs of osteoblasts might explain this apparent paradox. We show here that glucose, the main nutrient of osteoblasts, is transported in these cells through Glut1, whose expression precedes that of Runx2. Glucose uptake favors osteoblast differentiation by suppressing the AMPK-dependent proteasomal degradation of Runx2 and promotes bone formation by inhibiting another function of AMPK. While RUNX2 cannot induce osteoblast differentiation when glucose uptake is compromised, raising blood glucose levels restores collagen synthesis in Runx2-null osteoblasts and initiates bone formation in Runx2-deficient embryos. Moreover, RUNX2 favors Glut1 expression, and this feedforward regulation between RUNX2 and Glut1 determines the onset of osteoblast differentiation during development and the extent of bone formation throughout life. These results reveal an unexpected intricacy between bone and glucose metabolism."

The 2013–2015 Western African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, caused by the Ebola virus (EBOV) Makona variant (Kuhn et al., 2014Kuhn J.H. Andersen K.G. Baize S. Bào Y. Bavari S. Berthet N.

(2015). Ebola Situation Reports. http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/ebola-situation-reports.Google Scholar). The outbreak, first declared in March 2014 in Guinea and traced back to the end of 2013 (Baize et al., 2014Baize S. Pannetier D. Oestereich L. Rieger T. Koivogui L. Magassouba N. Soropogui B.

Med. 2014; 371: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), has also devastated the neighboring countries of Sierra Leone and Liberia, with additional cases scattered across the globe. Never before has an EBOV variant been transmitted among humans for such a sustained period of time. Published EBOV Makona genomes from clinical samples obtained early in the outbreak in Guinea (three patients) and Sierra Leone (78 patients) (Baize et al., 2014Baize S. Pannetier D. Oestereich L.

Analysis of these genomes revealed that the outbreak likely originated from a single introduction into the human population in Guinea at the end of 2013 and was then sustained exclusively by human-to-human transmissions. Genomic sequencing further allowed the identification of numerous mutations emerging in the EBOV Makona genome over time. As a consequence, the evolutionary rate of the Makona variant over the time span of the early phase of the outbreak could be estimated and predictions made about the potential of this new EBOV variant to escape current candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics (Kugelman et al., 2015aKugelman J.R.

Our laboratory teams in Sierra Leone, at Kenema (Kenema Government Hospital [KGH]) and at Bo (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]), continued to perform active diagnosis and surveillance in Sierra Leone following our initial study (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). After a 6-month delay of sample shipment due to regulatory uncertainty about inactivation protocols, we again began to determine EBOV genome sequences. We have sequenced samples at high depth and with technical replicates to characterize genetic diversity of EBOV both within (intrahost) and between (interhost) individuals. To support global outbreak termination efforts, we publicly released these genomes prior to publication as they were generated, starting with a first set of 45 sequences in December 2014 and continuing with regular releases of hundreds of sequences through May 2015. Here, we provide an analysis of 232 new, coding-complete EBOV Makona genomes from Sierra Leone. We compared these genomes to 86 previously available genomes: 78 unique genomes from Sierra Leone (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S.

Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), 3 genomes from Guinea (Baize et al., 2014Baize S. Pannetier D. Oestereich L. Rieger T. Koivogui L. Magassouba N. Soropogui B. Sow M.S. Keïta S. De Clerck H. et al.Emergence of Zaire Ebola virus disease in Guinea.N. Engl. J. Med. 2014; 371: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), and 5 from healthcare workers infected in Sierra Leone and treated in Europe. We use this combined data set obtained from 318 EVD patients during the height of the epidemic in Sierra Leone and Guinea to better understand EBOV transmission within Sierra Leone and between countries. In addition, we use it to understand viral population dynamics within individual hosts, the impact of natural selection, and the characteristics of the now hundreds of new mutations that have emerged over the longer course of the epidemic. We performed massively parallel genome sequencing on 673 samples from two EVD patient cohorts. The first cohort included 575 blood samples from 484 EVD patients confirmed by laboratory staff at KGH from June 16 through September 28, 2014. The second cohort included blood samples from 88 EVD patients from throughout Sierra Leone confirmed at Bo by CDC laboratory staff from August 20, 2014 through January 10, 2015. Samples from both EVD cohorts were sequenced using previously described methods (Experimental Procedures; Matranga et al., 2014Matranga C.B. Andersen K.G. Winnicki S. Busby M. Gladden A.D. Tewhey R. Stremlau M. Berlin A. Gire S.K.

We implemented a new computational pipeline, viral-ngs:v1.0.0, for viral genomic de novo assembly, intrahost variant calling, and genome analysis and annotation. This pipeline is available via open-source software (Park et al., 2015Park, D., Jungreis, I., Tomkins-Tinch, C., and Lin, M. (2015). viral-ngs: v1.0.0. http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17560.Google Scholar) and utilizes a generalized workflow engine to run on a wide variety of computer hardware configurations (Köster and Rahmann, 2012Köster J. Rahmann S. Snakemake—a scalable bioinformatics workflow engine.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2520-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Through a partnership with DNAnexus, this pipeline is also available in a secure cloud-compute environment to enable consistent analyses across laboratories with limited computational resources (Experimental Procedures). Using this pipeline, we successfully assembled 232 EBOV Makona coding-complete genomes (150 from KGH and 82 from the CDC cohort, spanning June 16 to December 26, 2014). Each assembled sequence was at least 18.5 kb in length, with a maximum of 6% ambiguous base calls per genome. The median assembly had 374× coverage, was 18.9 kb long, and had no ambiguous bases. Despite extensive sequencing, successful full-genome assembly was difficult to obtain from the KGH cohort (73% failed genome assemblies; 374× mean coverage; Table S1), compared to a previous cohort from the same laboratory, described in Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar (11% failed genome assemblies; 2,000× mean coverage). The high assembly failure rate of the more recent KGH cohort is likely due to the mandatory in-country implementation of a new EBOV sample deactivation protocol and to long delays for sample shipments amidst the outbreak response (see Experimental Procedures). In contrast, only 7% of samples from the CDC cohort failed to assemble. However, these samples had been pre-selected for sequencing based on high EBOV titers, as estimated by qPCR. In addition, the CDC cohort samples were collected more recently, did not remain in lysis buffer for an extended period, and were subjected to a different sample deactivation protocol than the KGH cohort samples. While we are continuing attempts to glean genomic information from compromised samples of the recent KGH cohort, important information may have been lost. In particular, samples from many EBOV-infected health-care workers at KGH, which could provide important insights into hospital-based transmissions, were compromised. In combination with the 86 previously published EBOV Makona genomes (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), we analyzed a total of 318 genomes (see Experimental Procedures), all aligned against the earliest sampled Guinean genome (GenBank: KJ660346.2). In this set, we observed 464 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; 125 nonsynonymous, 176 synonymous, and 163 noncoding). We also observed five single-base insertions and two double-base insertions in noncoding regions. We mapped all of the variants to primer-binding sites for known sequence-based diagnostics (Kugelman et al., 2015aKugelman J.R. Sanchez-Lockhart M. Andersen K.G. Gire S. Park D.J. Sealfon R. Lin A.E. Wohl S. Sabeti P.C. Kuhn J.H. Palacios G.F. Evaluation of the potential impact of Ebola virus genomic drift on the efficacy of sequence-based candidate therapeutics.MBio. 2015; 6 (e02227–e14)Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and found no mutations in these sites that were present in more than one Sierra Leonean sample (Table S2). We constructed a second, independent genome library for each of 150 high-quality samples from the KGH cohort to reliably determine intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) at low frequencies (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We identified 247 iSNVs (25 insertion/deletions that were excluded from all analyses, 73 nonsynonymous, 71 synonymous, and 78 noncoding), including 21 iSNVs shared by multiple patients. Very recently, another 175 EBOV Makona genomes were published based on a cohort from Sierra Leone, mostly sampled from the area of Freetown in the Fall of 2014 (Tong et al., 2015Tong Y.-G. Shi W.-F. Di Liu Qian J. Liang L. Bo X.-C. Liu J. Ren H.G. Fan H. Ni M. et al.China Mobile Laboratory Testing Team in Sierra LeoneGenetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone.Nature. 2015; (Published online May 13, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14490Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although these data were not included in our analyses, they are unlikely to significantly alter our primary findings (Figure S1). A previous study of EBOV Makona sequences elucidated viral transmission and evolution during the early stages of the outbreak in Sierra Leone (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) from late May to early June, 2014. The first reported EVD cases in Sierra Leone stemmed from two genetically distinct EBOV Makona lineages, believed to have been introduced from Guinea. One of these lineages (SL1) was more closely related to the then-available three Guinean genomes (two to five mutations) than the second lineage (SL2), which was characterized by four additional mutations. This finding suggested that SL2 had evolved from SL1 some months before it was observed in Sierra Leone. A third lineage (SL3), derived from SL2, emerged in mid-June 2014. SL3 differs from SL2 by a single mutation at position 10,218, first found as an intrahost variant (polymorphism within one individual) at a low frequency. SL3 became the most prevalent lineage in Sierra Leone during the first 3 weeks of the outbreak there, with SL1 disappearing soon after the appearance of SL3. The SL3-defining mutation is epidemiologically important, as it is the first commonly circulating mutation observed to arise within Sierra Leone’s borders. As the epidemic developed within Sierra Leone, the SL3 lineage continued to dominate the viral population within the country, with no evidence for additional imported EBOV lineages. In our data set, 97% of the genomes carry the SL3 mutation and the remainder belong to SL2 (Figure 1A). These results link all Sierra Leonean EVD cases to the initial introduction of EBOV into Sierra Leone, and they provide further evidence that all EVD cases during this outbreak arose from human-to-human transmission rather than from further zoonotic introductions from the unknown EBOV reservoir. This means that no newly imported viral diversity was detected after the initial introduction (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar); all newly sampled viruses likely descended from those sequenced in the initial weeks of the outbreak. The genetic similarity of these viruses suggests that importation from other countries was minimal, although we cannot definitively rule out a re-introduction from elsewhere for the SL2 viruses (3%) in our data set. Similarly, publicly available EBOV genomes from this outbreak can shed light on exportation of EBOV from Sierra Leone into other countries. All published genomes from elsewhere, including 26 from Liberia and 4 from Mali, lack the Sierra Leone-defining SL3 mutation (Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures). Given that 97% of Sierra Leonean EBOV sequences have the SL3 variant, extensive exportation would result in the spread of SL3 EBOV genomes, a spread that is not seen in the limited samples available to date. At least in Sierra Leone, and with the exception of events at the onset of the epidemic, transmission has likely been primarily within national borders (Figure S2 and Experimental Procedures), rather than by free interchange with neighboring countries. Intrahost variants (iSNVs) that appear during the course of the epidemic may provide valuable information about human-to-human transmission. In particular, shared iSNVs have been used to estimate the relative size of the transmission bottleneck (Emmett et al., 2015Emmett K.J. Lee A. Rabadan R. High-resolution genomic surveillance of 2014 Ebolavirus using shared subclonal variants.PLoS Curr. 2015; (Published online February 9, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.c7fd7946ba606c982668a96bcba43c90Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and to identify human-to-human transmission chains (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In the current data set, which includes 85 samples with at least one iSNV (Figure S3A), several iSNVs are shared among two or more patients, often spanning several months of the EVD epidemic (Figure 2A). The existence of shared iSNVs could be explained by patient infection from multiple sources (superinfection), sample contamination, recurring mutations (with or without balancing selection to reinforce mutations), or co-transmission of slightly diverged viruses that arose by mutation earlier in the transmission chain.Figure 2Evidence for Host-to-Host Transmission of Multiple Ebola Virus Makona GenomesShow full caption(A) Certain intrahost variants (iSNVs) appear in samples throughout the 2013–2015 EVD epidemic, suggesting that iSNVs can be transmitted between patients.

This figure shows only the portion of the tree relevant for this analysis; large branches with no SNPs or iSNVs at position 18,911 are not shown. See also Figure S3. We can rule out superinfection and contamination as primary explanations for the iSNVs in our data because none of the iSNVs are located at common SNP positions. For example, a SNP at position 14,019 is at intermediate frequency in the population (found in ∼40% of samples we sequenced) and defines the SL4 lineage (Figure 1A). If superinfection were common among EVD patients, we would expect to sometimes see both SL3 and SL4 viruses in the same patient, which would appear as an iSNV at that position. Contamination would result in a similar pattern, with intermediate-frequency SNPs appearing as iSNVs in contaminated samples. Additionally, contamination would be most visible in low-coverage, low-RNA-content samples because contaminants would make up more of the RNA available for sequencing, whereas samples with extremely high coverage would be the most visible contaminants (Figure S3B). The highest coverage sample (G4960.1) contains genomes belonging to lineage SL3 only and lacks the SL4 SNP, so if there were widespread contamination, we would see a low-frequency iSNV at position 14,019 in SL4 samples with iSNVs. Since SL3 and SL4 samples were processed together (eight of nine sequencing batches contained multiple samples from both lineages) and we saw no instances of an iSNV at that position, we conclude that superinfection and contamination are not important contributors to iSNVs. The remaining possible sources for persistently shared iSNVs are co-transmission and recurrent mutation. In either case, the iSNV could be maintained by balancing selection or could be evolving neutrally. Figure 2A suggests that selection is not the primary cause of persistence, since synonymous and nonsynonymous variants are equally common among the shared iSNVs, and selective pressures are likely to be different for the two classes of variant. All shared iSNVs are unlikely to be simply the product of recurring mutation: if they were, they should have a frequency spectrum heavily weighted toward low frequency, characteristic of new mutations. However, that is not the case. For example, the variant at position 18,911 is found at >15% frequency in eight different samples (Figure S3C), a much higher frequency than expected if the change represented a de novo mutation in each sample. In summary, we conclude that a combination of human-to-human transmission and recurrent mutations is likely responsible for the iSNV pattern observed in Figure 2A. This hypothesis is supported by the iSNV at position 18,911: samples containing this variant often cluster on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2B), although more isolated samples may represent separate mutation events. More generally, pairs of samples that share an iSNV are typically located near one another phylogenetically; these pairs are separated by an average of 0.16 years of evolution, whereas random pairs are separated by an average of 0.30 years (p < 10−4, randomization test). These results suggest transmission of iSNVs in at least some cases and therefore suggest that the transmission bottleneck is wide enough to facilitate the transmission of low- or intermediate-frequency variants between hosts. We previously reported that new mutations accumulated more rapidly in the viral population early in the outbreak than over the long-term in the reservoir (Gire et al., 2014Gire S.K. Goba A. Andersen K.G. Sealfon R.S.G. Park D.J. Kanneh L. Jalloh S. Momoh M. Fullah M. Dudas G. et al.Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the 2014 outbreak.Science. 2014; 345: 1369-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We hypothesized then that the higher rate early in the outbreak resulted from incomplete purifying selection—that is, we were detecting transient nonsynonymous variants that would later be removed by purifying selection (Pybus et al., 2007Pybus O.G. Rambaut A. Belshaw R. Freckleton R.P. Drummond A.J. Holmes E.C. Phylogenetic evidence for deleterious mutation load in RNA viruses and its contribution to viral evolution.Mol. Biol.

Biol. 2011; 11: 220Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The observed evolutionary rate is thus not an estimate of the underlying mutation rate since some deleterious mutations are purged by selection before they can be detected. But neither is it an estimate of the long-term substitution rate since other deleterious mutations have not been eliminated by selection at the time of analysis. We hypothesized that the EBOV Makona evolutionary rate would decline following the addition of genomes covering a longer evolutionary timescale. Such a decline is well characterized in members of other species (Duchene et al., 2014Duchene S. Holmes E.C. Ho S.Y. Analyses of evolutionary dynamics in viruses are hindered by a time-dependent bias in rate estimates.Proc. Biol.

With the present data set, we were able to examine the evolution of the virus over a longer time period. We found that the most probable estimated evolutionary rate of EBOV Makona is indeed markedly lower (mean posterior rate = 1.25 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year) and is closer to the long-term rate than to the rate estimated early in the outbreak (Figures 3A and S4).Figure S4Increased Sampling Improves Evolutionary Rate Estimates, Related to Figure 3Show full captionRate estimates in the recent dataset (Figure 3A) have much tighter credible intervals due to the significantly greater amount of time (total coalescent branch length) compared to the initial outbreak.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rate estimates in the recent dataset (Figure 3A) have much tighter credible intervals due to the significantly greater amount of time (total coalescent branch length) compared to the initial outbreak. How purifying selection acts at different timescales can also be seen in the distribution of mutations in the EBOV Makona genealogy. Deleterious mutations are more likely to result in transmission-impaired viruses and dead-end infections and may therefore only be present in individual patients. Mutations unique to individual patients are those that occur on the external branches of the phylogenetic tree, whereas internal branch mutations are those present in multiple samples in our data set.

However, research in this area has been undeveloped largely because the kinases that phosphorylate secreted proteins have escaped identification. Fam20C is a kinase that phosphorylates S-x-E/pS motifs on proteins in milk and in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth. Here, we show that Fam20C generates the majority of the extracellular phosphoproteome. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, mass spectrometry, and biochemistry, we identify more than 100 secreted phosphoproteins as genuine Fam20C substrates. Further, we show that Fam20C exhibits broader substrate specificity than previously appreciated. Functional annotations of Fam20C substrates suggest roles for the kinase beyond biomineralization, including lipid homeostasis, wound healing, and cell migration and adhesion. Our results establish Fam20C as the major secretory pathway protein kinase and serve as a foundation for new areas of investigation into the role of secreted protein phosphorylation in human biology and disease.

Extracellular protein phosphorylation dates back to 1883, when the secreted protein casein was shown to contain phosphate (Hammarsten, 1883Hammarsten O. Zur Frage ob Caseín ein einheitlicher Stoff sei.Hoppe Seylers Z. Physiol. Chem. 1883; 7: 227-273Google Scholar). More than a century later, Manning et al., 2002Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. The protein kinase complement of the human genome.Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6240) Google Scholar assembled an evolutionary tree depicting over 500 human protein kinases that phosphorylate a diverse array of substrates. However, evidence is lacking that any of these kinases localize within the secretory pathway where they could encounter proteins destined for secretion. We recently identified a small family of kinases that phosphorylate secreted proteins and proteoglycans (Figure 1A) (Tagliabracci et al., 2012Tagliabracci V.S. Engel J.L. Wen J. Wiley S.E. Worby C.A.

These enzymes bear little sequence similarity to canonical protein kinases; nevertheless, some of them are endowed with protein and sugar kinase activities. (Ishikawa et al., 2008Ishikawa H.O.

Pinna L.A. Dixon J.E. Secreted protein kinases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 121-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that one of these kinases, Fam20C, is the bona fide “Golgi casein kinase,” an enzyme that escaped identification for many years (Tagliabracci et al., 2012Tagliabracci V.S. Engel J.L. Wen J. Wiley S.E. Worby C.A. Kinch L.N. Xiao J. Grishin N.V. Dixon J.E.

Fam20C phosphorylates secreted proteins within S-x-E/pS motifs, including casein, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and members of the small integrin-binding ligand, N-linked glycoprotein (SIBLING) family (Ishikawa et al., 2012Ishikawa H.O.

The crystal structure of the Fam20C ortholog from Caenorhabditis elegans displayed an atypical kinase-like fold and revealed several unique features, such as disulfide bridges, N-linked glycosylations, and a novel insertion domain that is conserved in all Fam20 family members (Xiao et al., 2013Xiao J. Tagliabracci V.S. Wen J. Kim S.A. Dixon J.E. Crystal structure of the Golgi casein kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 10574-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The members of this family of secretory pathway kinases can phosphorylate both proteins and carbohydrates. In Drosophila, four-jointed regulates planar cell polarity by phosphorylating cadherin domains of Fat and Dachsous (Ishikawa et al., 2008Ishikawa H.O. Takeuchi H. Haltiwanger R.S. Irvine K.D. Four-jointed is a Golgi kinase that phosphorylates a subset of cadherin domains.Science. 2008; 321: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although the substrates for Fam20A, Fam198A, and Fam198B are unknown, Fam20B phosphorylates a xylose residue within the tetrasaccharide linkage region of proteoglycans (Koike et al., 2009Koike T. Izumikawa T. Tamura J. Kitagawa H. FAM20B is a kinase that phosphorylates xylose in the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region.Biochem. J. 2009; 421: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation markedly stimulates the activity of galactosyltransferase II to promote proteoglycan biosynthesis (Wen et al., 2014Wen J. Xiao J. Rahdar M. Choudhury B.P. Cui J. Taylor G.S. Esko J.D. Dixon J.E. Xylose phosphorylation functions as a molecular switch to regulate proteoglycan biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 15723-15728Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, a distantly related protein, Sgk196, originally annotated as a pseudokinase, was recently shown to localize in the ER/Golgi lumen and phosphorylate a mannose residue on α-dystroglycan (Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2013Yoshida-Moriguchi T. Willer T. Anderson M.E. Venzke D. Whyte T. Muntoni F. Lee H. Nelson S.F. Yu L. Campbell K.P. SGK196 is a glycosylation-specific O-mannose kinase required for dystroglycan function.Science. 2013; 341: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The inability to carry out this phosphorylation due to loss-of-function mutations in the human SGK196 gene results in a congenital form of muscular dystrophy (Jae et al., 2013Jae L.T. Raaben M.

POMK mutation in a family with congenital muscular dystrophy with merosin deficiency, hypomyelination, mild hearing deficit and intellectual disability.J. Med. Genet. 2014; 51: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition to the aforementioned kinases, the vertebrate lonesome kinase (VLK) is a secreted kinase that phosphorylates extracellular proteins on tyrosine residues (Bordoli et al., 2014Bordoli M.R. Yum J. Breitkopf S.B. Thon J.N. Italiano Jr., J.E. Xiao J. Worby C. Wong S.K. Lin G. Edenius M. et al.A secreted tyrosine kinase acts in the extracellular environment.Cell. 2014; 158: 1033-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several proteins related to VLK also localize in the secretory pathway and are predicted to have a kinase-like fold (Figures 1B and S1) (Dudkiewicz et al., 2013Dudkiewicz M. Lenart A. Pawłowski K. A novel predicted calcium-regulated kinase family implicated in neurological disorders.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e66427Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These proteins are poorly characterized molecularly; however, several of them have been genetically linked to neurological disorders, including Deleted in Autism-1 (DIA1) and DIA1-Related (DIA1R) (Aziz et al., 2011aAziz A.

Commun. 2011; 406: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Phosphoproteomic studies have revealed that more than two-thirds of human serum (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou W. Ross M.M. Tessitore A. Ornstein D. Vanmeter A. Liotta L.A. Petricoin 3rd, E.F. An initial characterization of the serum phosphoproteome.J. Proteome Res. 2009; 8: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), plasma (Carrascal et al., 2010Carrascal M. Gay M. Ovelleiro D. Casas V. Gelpí E. Abian J.

Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Bahl et al., 2008Bahl J.M. Jensen S.S. Larsen M.R. Heegaard N.H. Characterization of the human cerebrospinal fluid phosphoproteome by titanium dioxide affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 6308-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) phosphoproteins contain phosphate within a S-x-E/pS motif (Table S1). These observations suggest that kinases in the secretory pathway may have overlapping substrate specificity. Here, we provide evidence that Fam20C is responsible for phosphorylating the vast majority of secreted phosphoproteins. We identify more than 100 secreted phosphoproteins as genuine Fam20C substrates and uncover Fam20C-dependent phosphorylation sites within or surrounding residues that are mutated in human diseases (i.e., PCSK9, BMP4). Functional annotations of Fam20C substrates suggest roles for the kinase in a broad range of biological processes, including lipid homeostasis, endopeptidase inhibitor activity, wound healing, cell adhesion, and cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of Fam20C in breast cancer cells has a dramatic effect on cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. We anticipate that this work will open new areas of research on extracellular protein phosphorylation in human biology and disease. Many secretory pathway proteins undergo posttranslational modifications within the lumen of the ER and Golgi apparatus. N-terminal sequencing analysis of Fam20C purified from the conditioned medium of HEK293T cells revealed the mature protein to be truncated by 92 residues (Figure 2A). Mutation of a three amino acid stretch that spans this region (91LQD93 to 91AAA93) did not affect Fam20C secretion or activity as judged by its ability to induce a mobility change in the Fam20C substrate osteopontin (OPN) (Figure 2B). Human Fam20C is N-linked glycosylated on three Asn residues (N101, N335, and N470), and glycosylation appears to be important for proper folding of the enzyme because mutating these residues to Ala had a dramatic effect on Fam20C secretion (Figure 2C). Moreover, mutation of all three sites had a profound effect on Fam20C activity. To determine if Fam20C is itself a phosphoprotein, we expressed Flag-tagged Fam20C in 32P orthophosphate-labeled U2OS cells. Examination of Flag-immunoprecipitates from conditioned medium revealed that wild-type (WT) Fam20C, but not the catalytically inactive D478A mutant, incorporated 32P (Figure 2D). These results suggest that Fam20C undergoes autophosphorylation. There are three Fam20C consensus S-x-E motifs within the kinase; however, individual mutation of each Ser to Ala did not affect Fam20C activity and had modest effects on Fam20C secretion (Figure 2E). Studies using peptide substrates derived from known secreted phosphoproteins have suggested that Fam20C phosphorylates Ser residues within a S-x-E/pS motif (Ishikawa et al., 2012Ishikawa H.O. Xu A. Ogura E. Manning G. Irvine K.D. The Raine syndrome protein FAM20C is a Golgi kinase that phosphorylates bio-mineralization proteins.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e42988Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, Lasa-Benito et al., 1996Lasa-Benito M.

Secreted kinase phosphorylates extracellular proteins that regulate biomineralization.Science. 2012; 336: 1150-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To determine Fam20C specificity in an unbiased manner, we screened an arrayed combinatorial peptide library consisting of 198 biotinylated substrates (Hutti et al., 2004Hutti J.E. Jarrell E.T. Chang J.D. Abbott D.W. Storz P. Toker A. Cantley L.C. Turk B.E. A rapid method for determining protein kinase phosphorylation specificity.Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Fam20C strongly selected Glu at the +2 position, but displayed only minor selectivity at other positions (Figures 2F and 2G). This extraordinarily specific pattern of selectivity at the +2 position is unique among all kinases previously profiled (Mok et al., 2010Mok J. Kim P.M. Lam H.Y. Piccirillo S. Zhou X. Jeschke G.R. Sheridan D.L. Parker S.A. Desai V. Jwa M. et al.Deciphering protein kinase specificity through large-scale analysis of yeast phosphorylation site motifs.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra12Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To test whether other secretory kinases could phosphorylate S-x-E/pS motifs, we expressed and purified each of the Fam20C- and VLK-related proteins, as well as Sgk196, fused to maltose binding protein (MBP) using an insect cell expression system (Figure 2H). We then performed in vitro kinase assays with recombinant OPN and a synthetic peptide representing an S-x-E phosphorylation site in bovine β-casein (β28-40) as substrates (Figures 2I and 2J). Fam20C displayed a robust ability to phosphorylate OPN and β28-40, whereas the other secretory pathway kinases did not, even though several of these proteins were active enzymes based on their ability to autophosphorylate. We conclude that Fam20C specificity is unique among the known secretory pathway kinases. We engineered a C-terminal KDEL sequence on Fam20C to prevent secretion of the kinase. When expressed in U2OS cells, Fam20C containing a C-terminal KDEL sequence was not secreted, yet could still phosphorylate secreted OPN (Figures 2K and S2). Thus, it appears that phosphorylation of Fam20C substrates takes place in the lumen of the secretory pathway in cells where both the kinase and substrate are produced. These results also suggest that ATP is transported into the lumen of the secretory pathway; however, the mechanism by which this occurs in unknown. Because many serum and plasma phosphoproteins are synthesized and secreted from hepatocytes, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments on rat liver and detected endogenous Fam20C in the lumen of highly enriched Golgi fractions (Figures S3A and S3B). Therefore, we utilized the liver cell line HepG2 as a model system to ascertain the relative contribution of Fam20C kinase activity to the secreted phosphoproteome. We generated Fam20C knockout (KO) HepG2 cells by means of CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing (Figures S3C–S3E) (Cong et al., 2013Cong L. Ran F.A. Cox D. Lin S. Barretto R. Habib N. Hsu P.D. Wu X. Jiang W.

Using these cells, we performed a quantitative analysis of the Fam20C-dependent secreted phosphoproteome (Figure 3A). We collected serum-free conditioned medium from WT and Fam20C KO cells, trypsinized the proteins, and labeled them with isobaric tags (6-plex TMT). After combining the samples, phosphopeptides were enriched, fractionated, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Figure S4; Data S1). We restricted our analyses to phosphoproteins that are secreted via the conventional secretory pathway (i.e., signal peptide or luminal/extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins) and identified ∼150 phosphopeptides representing more than 50 distinct phosphoproteins (Figures 3B and 3C; Table 1). Remarkably, Fam20C KO cells displayed a >2-fold reduction in ∼90% of the significantly quantified phosphopeptides (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). These results demonstrate that the majority of HepG2 secreted phosphoproteins are Fam20C substrates. Importantly, several HepG2 secreted phosphoproteins have been identified in human serum (Zhou et al., 2009Zhou W. Ross M.M. Tessitore A. Ornstein D. Vanmeter A. Liotta L.A. Petricoin 3rd, E.F.

This graph represents all phosphopeptides identified in the quantitative mass spectrometry analysis, whereas the results depicted in Figure 3B represent only proteins that enter the secretory pathway (See Experimental Procedures). The phosphopeptides marked in red displayed a statistically significant decrease in Fam20C KO HepG2 cells (log2 fold change ≤ −1; -log10(p value) ≥ 1.3). Note: The observed fold changes in phosphorylation levels of sites in secreted proteins in the Fam20C KO cells compared to WT cells exhibits a wide range. In theory, if Fam20C were the only kinase that can phosphorylate these proteins, then one would expect an infinite decrease in phosphorylation. The fact that this is not observed, however, is merely due to how the proteomics data are processed. In the tandem mass tag (TMT) system, peptides or phosphopeptides from all six samples (3 WT and 3 KO) appear as a singe peak in the first (MS1) scan (because the tags are isobaric). That peak is selected for a second (MS2) scan where the tags are fragmented into six discernable “reporter ion” peaks. The relative intensities of those peaks are used to generate the fold-change data that is plotted on the volcano plot in Figure 3B. There are at least two scenarios that would cause an infinite fold change to be plotted as a finite number when using this system. First, in many cases (see Data S1 labeled Phos-Significant Decrease, Column K), the phosphopeptides from the Fam20C knockout samples do indeed have zero intensity. In these cases—simply for clarity and ease of processing—the peptides are assigned a background noise-level intensity. Here, because the wild-type samples have differing levels of intensity, a range of fold change values results (i.e., there are different numerator values and one common “noise-level” denominator value). Second, perfect quantitation using the TMT system would require that only the desired MS1 peak be isolated for the MS2 scan. In reality, in complex mixtures like these, small amounts of contaminating peptides are often co-selected for the MS2 scan. Once fragmented, the tag intensities from all selected peptides factor into the fold-change calculation. Note that this phenomenon is the reason that Fam20C itself is only observed to have a log2 fold change of −2.10, even though it is clearly completely absent in the KO samples. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that other kinases can phosphorylate these sites as well.

https://openalex.org/W1534852475,"A subset of individuals infected with HIV-1 develops broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that can prevent infection, but it has not yet been possible to elicit these antibodies by immunization. To systematically explore how immunization might be tailored to produce them, we generated mice expressing the predicted germline or mature heavy chains of a potent bNAb to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). Immunogens specifically designed to activate B cells bearing germline antibodies are required to initiate immune responses, but they do not elicit bNAbs. In contrast, native-like Env trimers fail to activate B cells expressing germline antibodies but elicit bNAbs by selecting for a restricted group of light chains bearing specific somatic mutations that enhance neutralizing activity. The data suggest that vaccination to elicit anti-HIV-1 antibodies will require immunization with a succession of related immunogens."
https://openalex.org/W1944269902,"The DebtRank algorithm has been increasingly investigated as a method to estimate the impact of shocks in financial networks, as it overcomes the limitations of the traditional default-cascade approaches. Here we formulate a dynamical ""microscopic"" theory of instability for financial networks by iterating balance sheet identities of individual banks and by assuming a simple rule for the transfer of shocks from borrowers to lenders. By doing so, we generalise the DebtRank formulation, both providing an interpretation of the effective dynamics in terms of basic accounting principles and preventing the underestimation of losses on certain network topologies. Depending on the structure of the interbank leverage matrix the dynamics is either stable, in which case the asymptotic state can be computed analytically, or unstable, meaning that at least one bank will default. We apply this framework to a dataset of the top listed European banks in the period 2008-2013. We find that network effects can generate an amplification of exogenous shocks of a factor ranging between three (in normal periods) and six (during the crisis) when we stress the system with a 0.5% shock on external (i.e. non-interbank) assets for all banks."
https://openalex.org/W1508813429,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the perceived impact of dental caries and dental pain on oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among preschool children and their families. A cross-sectional study was conduct with 843 preschool children in Campina Grande, Brazil. Parents/caregivers answered a questionnaire on socio-demographic information, their child’s general/oral health and history of dental pain. The Brazilian version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale was administered to determine the perceived impact of caries and dental pain on OHRQoL. The children underwent an oral examination. Logistic regression for complex sample was used to determine associations between the dependent and independent variables (OR: Odds ratio, α = 5%). The independents variables that had a p-value <0.20 in the bivariate analysis were selected for the multivariate model. The prevalence of dental caries and dental pain was 66.3% and 9.4%, respectively. Order of birth of the child, being the middle child (OR: 10.107, 95%CI: 2.008-50.869) and youngest child (OR: 3.276, 95%CI: 1.048-10.284) and dental pain (OR: 84.477, 95%CI: 33.076-215.759) were significant predictors of the perceived impact on OHRQOL for children. Poor perception of oral health was significant predictor of the perceived impact on OHRQOL for family (OR=7.397, 95%CI: 2.190-24.987). Dental caries was not associated with a perceived impact on the ORHQoL of either the children or their families. However, order of child birth and dental pain were indicators of impact of OHRQoL on preschool children and poor perception of oral health was indicators of impact on families."
https://openalex.org/W1905000093,"The average sizes of Pacific salmon have declined in some areas in the Northeast Pacific over the past few decades, but the extent and geographic distribution of these declines in Alaska is uncertain. Here, we used regression analyses to quantify decadal trends in length and age at maturity in ten datasets from commercial harvests, weirs, and spawner abundance surveys of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha throughout Alaska. We found that on average these fish have become smaller over the past 30 years (~6 generations), because of a decline in the predominant age at maturity and because of a decrease in age-specific length. The proportion of older and larger 4-ocean age fish in the population declined significantly (P < 0.05) in all stocks examined by return year or brood year. Our analyses also indicated that the age-specific lengths of 4-ocean fish (9 of 10 stocks) and of 3-ocean fish (5 of 10 stocks) have declined significantly (P < 0.05). Size-selective harvest may be driving earlier maturation and declines in size, but the evidence is not conclusive, and additional factors, such as ocean conditions or competitive interactions with other species of salmon, may also be responsible. Regardless of the cause, these wide-spread phenotypic shifts influence fecundity and population abundance, and ultimately may put populations and associated fisheries at risk of decline."
https://openalex.org/W927534094,"Social unrest is endemic in many societies, and recent news has drawn attention to happenings in Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Civilian populations mobilize, sometimes spontaneously and sometimes in an organized manner, to raise awareness of key issues or to demand changes in governing or other organizational structures. It is of key interest to social scientists and policy makers to forecast civil unrest using indicators observed on media such as Twitter, news, and blogs. We present an event forecasting model using a notion of activity cascades in Twitter (proposed by Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2011) to predict the occurrence of protests in three countries of Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. The basic assumption is that the emergence of a suitably detected activity cascade is a precursor or a surrogate to a real protest event that will happen ""on the ground."" Our model supports the theoretical characterization of large cascades using spectral properties and uses properties of detected cascades to forecast events. Experimental results on many datasets, including the recent June 2013 protests in Brazil, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
https://openalex.org/W2282403098,"Knowing how acid soils and aluminum in soils may limit the growth of Eucalyptus trees in plantations is important because these plantations grow in many tropical and subtropical regions. Seedlings of four vegetatively propagated Eucalyptus clones, E. grandis × E. urophylla ‘GLGU9’(G9), E. grandis × E. urophylla ‘GLGU12’ (G12), E. urophylla × E. camaldulensis ‘GLUC3’ (G3) and E. urophylla ‘GLU4’(G4), were subjected to liquid culture with Hoagland nutrient solution for 40 days, then treated with four different treatments of acid and aluminum for 1 day. The four treatments used either pH 3.0 or 4.0 with or without added aluminum (4.4 mM) in all possible combinations; a control used no added aluminum at pH 4.8. Subsequently, the photosynthetic parameters and morphology of leaves from eucalypt seedlings were determined and observed. The results showed that the tested chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and water use efficiency were apparently inhibited by aluminum. Under uniform Al concentration (4.4 mM), the Al-induced limitation to photosynthetic parameters increased with pH, indicating acid stimulation to Al toxicity. Among all treatments, the most significant reduction was found in the combination of pH 3.0 and 4.4 mM Al. The photosynthetic and transpiration rates showed similar trends with G9 > G12 > G3 > G4, suggesting that G9 and G12 had higher Al-tolerance than other two clones. Microscopic observation revealed changes in leaf morphology when exposed to Al stress; for example, a reduced thickness of leaf epidermis and palisade tissue, the descendant palisade tissue/spongy tissue ratio and leaf tissue looseness. Overall, the acid and aluminum stress exerted negative effects on the photosynthetic activity of eucalypt seedlings, but the differences in tolerance to Al toxicity between the clones were favorable, offering potential to improve Eucalyptus plantation productivity by selecting Al tolerant clones."
https://openalex.org/W840036572,"In the present study we have investigated the population genetic structure of albacore (Thunnus alalunga, Bonnaterre 1788) and assessed the loss of genetic diversity, likely due to overfishing, of albacore population in the North Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, 1,331 individuals from 26 worldwide locations were analyzed by genotyping 75 novel nuclear SNPs. Our results indicated the existence of four genetically homogeneous populations delimited within the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Current definition of stocks allows the sustainable management of albacore since no stock includes more than one genetic entity. In addition, short- and long-term effective population sizes were estimated for the North Atlantic Ocean albacore population, and results showed no historical decline for this population. Therefore, the genetic diversity and, consequently, the adaptive potential of this population have not been significantly affected by overfishing."
https://openalex.org/W1859645252,"Hypokalemia has been consistently associated with high mortality rate in peritoneal dialysis. However, studies investigating if hypokalemia is acting as a surrogate marker of comorbidities or has a direct effect in the risk for mortality have not been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of hypokalemia on overall and cause-specific mortality.This is an analysis of BRAZPD II, a nationwide prospective cohort study. All patients on PD for longer than 90 days with measured serum potassium levels were used to verify the association of hypokalemia with overall and cause-specific mortality using a propensity match score to reduce selection bias. In addition, competing risks were also taken into account for the analysis of cause-specific mortality.There was a U-shaped relationship between time-averaged serum potassium and all-cause mortality of PD patients. Cardiovascular disease was the main cause of death in the normokalemic group with 133 events (41.8%) followed by PD-non related infections, n=105 (33.0%). Hypokalemia was associated with a 49% increased risk for CV mortality after adjustments for covariates and the presence of competing risks (SHR 1.49; CI95% 1.01-2.21). In contrast, in the group of patients with K <3.5 mEq/L, PD-non related infections were the main cause of death with 43 events (44.3%) followed by cardiovascular disease (n=36; 37.1%). For PD-non related infections the SHR was 2.19 (CI95% 1.52-3.14) while for peritonitis was SHR 1.09 (CI95% 0.47-2.49).Hypokalemia had a significant impact on overall, cardiovascular and infectious mortality even after adjustments for competing risks. The causative nature of this association suggested by our study raises the need for intervention studies looking at the effect of potassium supplementation on clinical outcomes of PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1124641164,"Transplantation of pancreatic islets is one approach for treatment of diabetes, however, hampered by the low availability of viable islets. Islet isolation leads to disruption of the environment surrounding the endocrine cells, which contributes to eventual cell death. The reestablishment of this environment is vital, why we herein investigated the possibility of using recombinant spider silk to support islets in vitro after isolation. The spider silk protein 4RepCT was formulated into three different formats; 2D-film, fiber mesh and 3D-foam, in order to provide a matrix that can give the islets physical support in vitro. Moreover, cell-binding motifs from laminin were incorporated into the silk protein in order to create matrices that mimic the natural cell environment. Pancreatic mouse islets were thoroughly analyzed for adherence, necrosis and function after in vitro maintenance on the silk matrices. To investigate their suitability for transplantation, we utilized an eye model which allows in vivo imaging of engraftment. Interestingly, islets that had been maintained on silk foam during in vitro culture showed improved revascularization. This coincided with the observation of preserved islet architecture with endothelial cells present after in vitro culture on silk foam. Selected matrices were further evaluated for long-term preservation of human islets. Matrices with the cell-binding motif RGD improved human islet maintenance (from 36% to 79%) with preserved islets architecture and function for over 3 months in vitro. The islets established cell-matrix contacts and formed vessel-like structures along the silk. Moreover, RGD matrices promoted formation of new, insulin-positive islet-like clusters that were connected to the original islets via endothelial cells. On silk matrices with islets from younger donors (<35 year), the amount of newly formed islet-like clusters found after 1 month in culture were almost double compared to the initial number of islets added."
https://openalex.org/W2155817871,"Ecosystem services provided by mobile agents are increasingly threatened by the loss and modification of natural habitats and by climate change, risking the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and human welfare. Research oriented towards a better understanding of the joint effects of land use and climate change over the provision of specific ecosystem services is therefore essential to safeguard such services. Here we propose a methodological framework, which integrates species distribution forecasts and graph theory to identify key conservation areas, which if protected or restored could improve habitat connectivity and safeguard ecosystem services. We applied the proposed framework to the provision of pollination services by a tropical stingless bee (Melipona quadrifasciata), a key pollinator of native flora from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and important agricultural crops. Based on the current distribution of this bee and that of the plant species used to feed and nest, we projected the joint distribution of bees and plants in the future, considering a moderate climate change scenario (following IPPC). We then used this information, the bee's flight range, and the current mapping of Atlantic Forest remnants to infer habitat suitability and quantify local and regional habitat connectivity for 2030, 2050 and 2080. Our results revealed north to south and coastal to inland shifts in the pollinator distribution during the next 70 years. Current and future connectivity maps unraveled the most important corridors, which if protected or restored, could facilitate the dispersal and establishment of bees during distribution shifts. Our results also suggest that coffee plantations from eastern São Paulo and southern Minas Gerais States could suffer a pollinator deficit in the future, whereas pollination services seem to be secured in southern Brazil. Landowners and governmental agencies could use this information to implement new land use schemes. Overall, our proposed methodological framework could help design novel conservational and agricultural practices that can be crucial to conserve ecosystem services by buffering the joint effect of habitat configuration and climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2210282370,"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive mosquito species that transmits chikungunya and dengue. This species overwinters as diapausing eggs in temperate climates. Early diapause termination may be a beneficial strategy for winter mosquito control; however, a mechanism to terminate the diapause process using chemicals is not known. We tested the hypothesis that a hormonal imbalance caused by the administration of juvenile hormone analog would terminate egg diapause in A. albopictus. We tested the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen on all developmental stages to identify a susceptible stage for diapause termination. We found that pyriproxyfen treatment of mosquito eggs terminated embryonic diapause. The highest rates of diapause termination were recorded in newly deposited (78.9%) and fully embryonated (74.7%) eggs at 0.1 and 1 ppm, respectively. Hatching was completed earlier in newly deposited eggs (25-30 days) compared to fully embryonated eggs (71-80 days). The combined mortality from premature diapause termination and ovicidal activity was 98.2% in newly deposited and >98.9% in fully embryonated eggs at 1 ppm. The control diapause eggs did not hatch under diapausing conditions. Pyriproxyfen exposure to larvae, pupae and adults did not prevent the females from ovipositing diapausing eggs. There was no effect of pyriproxyfen on diapausing egg embryonic developmental time. We also observed mortality in diapausing eggs laid by females exposed to pyriproxyfen immediately after blood feeding. There was no mortality in eggs laid by females that survived larval and pupal exposures. In conclusion, diapausing eggs were the more susceptible to pyriproxyfen diapause termination compared to other life stages. This is the first report of diapause termination in A. albopictus with a juvenile hormone analog. We believe our findings will be useful in developing a new control strategy against overwintering mosquito populations."
https://openalex.org/W2129605132,"Valve endothelial cells (VEC) have unique phenotypic responses relative to other types of vascular endothelial cells and have highly sensitive hemostatic functions affected by changes in valve tissues. Furthermore, effects of environmental factors on VEC hemostatic function has not been characterized. This work used a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel platform to evaluate the effects of substrate stiffness and cell adhesive ligands on VEC phenotype and expression of hemostatic genes. Hydrogels of molecular weights (MWs) 3.4, 8, and 20 kDa were polymerized into platforms of different rigidities and thiol-modified cell adhesive peptides were covalently bound to acrylate groups on the hydrogel surfaces. The peptide RKRLQVQLSIRT (RKR) is a syndecan-1 binding ligand derived from laminin, a trimeric protein and a basement membrane matrix component. Conversely, RGDS is an integrin binding peptide found in many extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including fibronectin, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). VECs adhered to and formed a stable monolayer on all RKR-coated hydrogel-MW combinations. RGDS-coated platforms supported VEC adhesion and growth on RGDS-3.4 kDa and RGDS-8 kDa hydrogels. VECs cultured on the softer RKR-8 kDa and RKR-20 kDa hydrogel platforms had significantly higher gene expression for all anti-thrombotic (ADAMTS-13, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and tissue plasminogen activator) and thrombotic (VWF, tissue factor, and P-selectin) proteins than VECs cultured on RGDS-coated hydrogels and tissue culture polystyrene controls. Stimulated VECs promoted greater platelet adhesion than non-stimulated VECs on their respective culture condition; yet stimulated VECs on RGDS-3.4 kDa gels were not as responsive to stimulation relative to the RKR-gel groups. Thus, the syndecan binding, laminin-derived peptide promoted stable VEC adhesion on the softer hydrogels and maintained VEC phenotype and natural hemostatic function. In conclusion, utilization of non-integrin adhesive peptide sequences derived from basement membrane ECM may recapitulate balanced VEC function and may benefit endothelialization of valve implants."
https://openalex.org/W1908340336,"Numerous studies have investigated the direct retrieval of soil properties, including soil texture, using remotely sensed images. However, few have considered how soil properties influence dynamic changes in remote images or how soil processes affect the characteristics of the spectrum. This study investigated a new method for mapping regional soil texture based on the hypothesis that the rate of change of land surface temperature is related to soil texture, given the assumption of similar starting soil moisture conditions. The study area was a typical flat area in the Yangtze-Huai River Plain, East China. We used the widely available land surface temperature product of MODIS as the main data source. We analyzed the relationships between the content of different particle soil size fractions at the soil surface and land surface day temperature, night temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR) during three selected time periods. These periods occurred after rainfalls and between the previous harvest and the subsequent autumn sowing in 2004, 2007 and 2008. Then, linear regression models were developed between the land surface DTR and sand (> 0.05 mm), clay (< 0.001 mm) and physical clay (< 0.01 mm) contents. The models for each day were used to estimate soil texture. The spatial distribution of soil texture from the studied area was mapped based on the model with the minimum RMSE. A validation dataset produced error estimates for the predicted maps of sand, clay and physical clay, expressed as RMSE of 10.69%, 4.57%, and 12.99%, respectively. The absolute error of the predictions is largely influenced by variations in land cover. Additionally, the maps produced by the models illustrate the natural spatial continuity of soil texture. This study demonstrates the potential for digitally mapping regional soil texture variations in flat areas using readily available MODIS data."

The knowledge of how the population perceives the disease and its vector is essential in order to design an effective management strategy, but such studies are rare in Pakistan.The present study was based on a cross-sectional self-administered survey comprising 250 household samples collected from five localities including Bhawalpur, Multan, Jhang, Faisalabad and Lahore. The results revealed that the respondents had a poor knowledge of the vector and disease. Few of the respondents were aware about the identification of sand flies, their breeding place, biting time, transmission of leishmaniasis and control measures. Skin infection and sandflies as the main disease symptom and vector of the disease, respectively, were known to some of the respondents. Some believed that summer was the main peak incidence of the disease and it could be transmitted from man to man via contact. However, most of the respondents believed that the disease could be cured. Admission to hospitals, cleanliness and use of bed nets were the treatment measures for the disease in suspected patients, whereas some thought that the use of bed nets could be helpful in preventing leishmaniasis infection.Poor knowledge of the disease and its vector in the study population emphasize the need to initiate health education and awareness campaigns to minimize the risks of cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreaks in the future."

Many feel that the R01 grant system supporting biomedical research in the U.S. is broken, discouraging entry of young investigators into the system and inadequately supporting more established investigators. Here, I argue for a “person-not-project”-based scheme that would permit creative, unfettered research by new investigators, better tie ongoing research contributions to continued funding, and help match the number of investigators seeking support with available funds. An increasing number of commentaries have highlighted the serious problems with the present state of NIH-funded biomedical research in the U.S. (Alberts et al., 2014Alberts B. Kirschner M.W.

(2015). Two Kinds of Grants? http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/201505/PresidentsMessage/.Google Scholar). Several of these papers have emphasized the competition for funding, the associated discouragement of bright individuals from seeking a career in research, the reduction in research progress due to the excessive time spent by investigators preparing grant applications, and the inhibition of creativity resulting from the nature of the grant review process. In many ways, these problems are all linked to the current R01 grant system. What was once a highly effective mechanism for parceling out support to the most deserving scientists has now evolved into what many investigators see as a stultifying, regimented process in which form often counts for more than content and in which any proposal lacking substantial evidence of already having been largely accomplished is unlikely to be supported. It is also a process in which the applicant “dissembles” about the true purpose of the grant, given that most of the proposed aims will necessarily have already been accomplished to satisfy the need for preliminary evidence, and the funding will thus be used for research other than that the grant asks for support to accomplish. Although these problems affect investigators at all stages of career progression, they are most damaging to those contemplating a future in research or just beginning their independent research careers. In the former case, there is a keen appreciation of the disconnect that exists between how a smart and hardworking student succeeds in moving along the educational pathway versus the likelihood of success as a PI. The ego structure of most scientists is one in which the person believes that a combination of intelligence and effort begets academic success. Accomplishments in high school facilitate entrance into a top college or university, where similar traits allow accomplishments supporting entrance into a top graduate or medical school, and likewise through postdoctoral training, and finally to the offer of a junior faculty position at a top institution. But then the vagaries of the R01 system intrude, disconnecting the two traits that unpinned success to this point from any predictable success going forward (Fang and Casadevall, 2014Fang, F.C., and Casadevall, A. (2014). Taking the Powerball Approach to Funding Medical Research. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303532704579477530153771424.Google Scholar). The result is that many of the best young “proto-scientists” are opting against pursuing a research career. This was brought home through the anecdotal (but I think cogent) experience of my son who majored in biology and graduated from Stanford in 2009. To his and my surprise, very few of the ∼100 students graduating that year with a degree in biology chose to move on directly to Ph.D. programs. Although some entered M.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. programs, many discussions at the departmental graduation ceremony centered on the theme of how much students enjoyed their undergraduate scientific research efforts but wanted or had to plan for careers doing something other than full-time basic science. These choices were largely predicated on the experiences these people had during undergraduate research in top laboratories at Stanford. There they saw the struggles and uncertainty faced by even very successful postdocs and PIs and decided that they did not want to take the career risks the Ph.D./academic research pathway posed. With respect to those who have made it to a junior faculty research appointment, these individuals must often begin submitting R01 applications within a year or two of starting their labs. This is not only because of the need for additional funding beyond start-up support but also because this is demanded by the employing institution and promotion boards. In the past, when perhaps 10%–15% of one’s time was occupied with grant preparation, this was not a problem, and there was merit in the argument that such grant preparation helped focus the thinking of the investigator and resulted in more productive research activity. But now, 50% or more of a faculty member’s time can easily be spent in grant preparation. For junior faculty, this drastically hampers their ability to perform experiments themselves, at a time when they are the most accomplished and effective member of their laboratory staff. As a result, far too many young investigators almost immediately retreat to their office, abandoning the bench and relying on students before they have fully established their own research programs or learned how to evaluate data generated by others. The consequences are clear: much less efficient research and a tendency to be conservative and do experiments that can lead to “preliminary data” required for grant applications, most often next steps from postdoctoral research rather than novel, creative studies, all at a slower pace than should be the case. Many of these problems affecting rising scientists and junior faculty members can be largely rectified by changes in how biomedical science is funded. Rather than supporting the project, it is time for the majority of the R01-equivalent research enterprise to move to the investigator-centric support strategy of the HHMI (HHMI, 2015HHMI (2015). Investigator Program. http://www.hhmi.org/programs/biomedical-research/investigator-program.Google Scholar), NIH intramural program (National Institutes of Health, 2015aNational Institutes of Health (2015a). Our Review Process: A Step-by-Step Guide. http://irp.nih.gov/our-research/inside-the-irp.Google Scholar), and Wellcome Trust (Wellcome Trust, 2015Wellcome Trust (2015). Investigator Awards. http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/funding/biomedical-science/funding-schemes/investigator-awards/index.htm.Google Scholar) (among others), a strategy being considered by some NIH institutes as a replacement to conventional project-oriented grants for at least some established investigators (Kaiser, 2014Kaiser J. Science. 2014; 345: 366-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). I have asked dozens of senior colleagues to answer the following question: “If I gave you $5 million to distribute for research and said you could either have the CV or a grant proposal, but not both, from the applicants, which would you choose to help guide distribution of the funds?” The results are nearly 100% votes for the CV—in contrast to financial investments for which it is said “past performance is no indication of future returns,” in science, it is widely accepted that past performance, not a detailed research plan, is the best predictor of future success. So why stay with the fiction that R01 grant proposals are the best method for determining support of the individual scientist, given that, as stated above, these grants now require most of the work to have already been accomplished at least in preliminary form and that true creativity is often cause for lower scores? To address these problems, including the choice by some of the best and brightest students in the U.S. not to pursue a career in science, I believe the NIH should transition to a system that links getting a first job (faculty appointment) with sufficient funding to support a reasonably sized laboratory (three to five people, including the PI) in terms of staff salaries and supplies, with the institution adding in some support for faculty salary and large equipment. How this linkage between jobs and NIH funding should be accomplished is described in detail below. Once the new hire is in place, the new faculty member then would have 5–7 years (this could vary among disciplines) to pursue whatever they wish, with no need for conventional project-specific R01 funding. At the end of this time, they would be evaluated for further funding based on what they have accomplished (the review would be ∼90% retrospective, 10% on general, not detailed, plans for future work). There would be three main outcomes: (1) failure due to lack of substantial output and contributions to the field, resulting in a cessation of funding, (2) value added to the field that permits continued but not increased funding, and (3) stellar performance (e.g., opening a new area of research), which allows continued funding and a request for expansion. There would be two exceptions to the cutoff of funds for people in the first outcome grouping: (1) cases in which the investigators can show that, within another year, they would likely make a major advance or (2) cases in which investigators tried something extremely original or risky in the earlier years of their appointment; the latter could obtain 1–2 years of bridge funding on a case-by-case basis. In addition, due allowance for family and health-related issues would be made in determining the timing of the initial review point. This plan for new faculty would be connected to a rolling change in the present R01 grant mechanism among more senior investigators by switching to retrospective review in 5–7 year cycles as the major grants of an individual come due. If possible, it would be best to roll all R01 grant award into one or two new awards (if the breadth of research requires support from more than a single NIH institute) at a particular point for each investigator, rather than to have different reviews for different grants and topics at varying times. Several issues arise in terms of the starting junior faculty proposal, first among them being the source of the funding. I believe that the best mechanism is to provide the appointing institution with block grants that can only be used for such new faculty support. This is because the institutions make the appointments, and a national parsing of support would be hard to coordinate with such hiring decisions in advance. This is clearly a point of contention, with many of those I spoke to about this issue being opposed to institutional award and favoring instead a national NIH-operated competition on an individual basis. I find the latter hard to imagine as workable—there are at least 200 open junior biomedical faculty positions every year spread across institutions and departments, with >200–300 applicants for each opening. Even accounting for a 5× overlap in applicants for similar positions, this would lead to >4,000 applications to evaluate per year and brings us to the problem of study sections and their make-up. Further, it would be difficult to align award with open faculty positions on a field or department basis. Other limitations to a scheme of individual funding would be institutional hiring based on a candidate having money and not necessarily based on merit or potential (the judgment of NIH study sections is very likely not to match that of faculty at the hiring institutions). More discussion is certainly welcome, and an even better scheme might emerge from further consideration of this point. Which institutions would get funding in the proposed scheme and how would the scale of the institutional awards be determined? One logical possibility is that, at the beginning of the launch of this new plan, all institutions presently with K22, K99, R21, R01, etc. awards for their junior faculty would receive grants whose scale is based on historical data reflecting the institution’s receipt of such awards over the past 10 years, factoring in the increased costs associated with full funding of a 3–5 person laboratory for 5–7 years. In this way, one does not need new dollars to get the program started and there will be natural “population control” in that institutions will be constrained in the number of new appointments they can make. By making renewal of the institutional block award contingent on the funding rate of that institution’s appointees upon their initial retrospective review in the “new R01 regime” I outline above, the institutions would be forced to provide a high level of support and mentoring to the junior faculty to help ensure their success. I have discussed this specific plan with various HHMI investigators, tenured and non-tenured faculty at diverse institutions, postdoctoral fellows, and students around the U.S. The responses range from substantial interest to enormous enthusiasm, most at the latter end of the scale. The major questions raised about the plan beyond those dealt with above have been the following:1.How would the money be apportioned to support the program? I have addressed this in part above, but some have broached the question of whether this would make the “rich richer” and also pose political problems because of the skewed distribution of grants and faculty in the current research landscape. I think that both points are valid but can be addressed. First, no institution would get less on average than they get now, so the distribution is not “unfair” in that regard. As to disadvantaging an institution that is trying to “up its game,” even in the present situation, this usually requires a large upfront internal financial investment from the institution (typically utilizing private or state dollars) to attract faculty that it wouldn’t otherwise be able to compete for, so this would remain the same. However, as renewal applications of existing new faculty support block awards come in, one would imagine that some institutions will do more poorly than others. Up-and-coming institutions, if they can show a high rate of success when their internally funded new hires go into the retrospective review program, would be able to outcompete the present block grant holders whose new hire success rate is at the low end of the scale and capture the block funding going forward. So the system can accommodate changes in institutional strength over time.2.What about the geographic distribution of funding and the concern of Representatives and Senators about institutions in their districts/states? Again, the distribution is not different from what exists now, so it is unclear there would be reason for complaint, but of course, this issue isn’t always debated in a completely dispassionate manner. I am not such a purist that I don’t see some value in insuring minimal base funding for major (state) institutions even if their historical record wouldn’t support making a large block award (though I note that many state universities are strong research centers). This is not just for political reasons. Often such institutions are the only places some students can afford to go to college, and exposing these students to active research would allow capture of some potentially outstanding future scientists who would otherwise lack mentors and the experience of laboratory research to propel them further in this direction.3.Is the recommendation for termination of funding at the end of any given cycle due to “non-performance” too harsh? Aside from the exceptions listed for new investigators that would result in bridge funding for 1–2 years (imminent major progress or investment in a potentially important but risky project), should the result of a poor review for either the first or any subsequent cycle be a drastic reduction in funding continued for a full cycle rather than cessation of an award, with the hope that such a cut would lead the investigator to focus intently on a limited question and make sufficient progress to pass muster at the next review? I have doubts about this alternative—with 5–7 years of support per round and 1–2 years of bridge funding available, I think it is unlikely that a highly competent investigator will fail to produce enough during 6–9 years of research to warrant a “passing grade” without further extensions, except in extenuating circumstances. Further discussion will be needed to develop a policy dealing with accommodations in grant term related to family and health-related issues. It should also be noted that the current R01 system possesses the same “deficiencies,” as R01 renewal is also a binary outcome. Although current investigators with multiple grants can afford to fail to renew some funding sources without shutting down their laboratories, in the plan proposed here, PIs similarly funded to perform a broad range of projects would also be “protected” against complete loss of funding by being able to show progress in subsets of these diverse projects.A related issue is whether there can and/or should be an opportunity for additional funding during the initial 5–7 year new faculty support period—for example, if an unexpected result looks like it would open a new area and there is a desire to add work in that direction to ongoing efforts. I think in the main that the support I am proposing should be adequate for the PI to take advantage of such observations by terminating less productive activities in the lab and redirecting funds and personnel to this more promising avenue. Of course, some allowances may need to be made at times in deference to graduate student and postdoctoral fellow career issues. There will also be occasions when the nature of the work is such that only additional funding will allow the new opportunity to be properly pursued, so a limited number of awards in support of such novel projects could be part of the plan. I worry that application for such funds would quickly become routine, but perhaps a mechanism to allow such funding on rare occasions could be found that avoids this pitfall. One possibility is to give institutions the ability to hold back a small fraction of their block grant funds and disburse these in response to requests from their own investigators hired through this mechanism. Such a scheme would make the institutions responsible for ensuring that the money was well employed, as the outcome of such supplemental awards would be taken into account during the institution block grant review process that is based on the success of the new career hires.A last point on this topic is what to do with rising stars who wish to expand their laboratories earlier than the usual 5–7 year point of entry into the retrospective review system. I think that there is every reason to allow investigators to try their luck with the review process earlier than the maximally permitted period. It is a risk of course in that those doing the review may not agree that the work is quite so stellar, so I suspect only those with the strongest programs will opt for this possibility. This makes it likely that only a small number of such early renewals with a request for expansion will come in, and I see no reason to deny such (putatively) successful PIs a chance to build more rapidly.4.The description of this change in funding is cast above as if NIH is a monolithic organization, but of course, it consists of nearly two-dozen institutes that make grant awards. Substantial thought (and political will) will be necessary to put this plan into operation in the context of the separate budgets for these institutes and their different primary areas of research support. This is not a simple matter to parse, as the most obvious solution requires some adjustment of budgets among institutes (a politically fraught issue), but if the basic tenets of the proposal are accepted as desirable goals, I believe this problem can be resolved.5.This proposal does not deal explicitly with the difficulties that exist in creating more opportunities for minority and underserved populations to enter and succeed in the biomedical research arena. Augmenting such representation requires changes at all stages of education before the faculty entry point of the funding system described here. However, I do think that this scheme provides those who make it to the first tier in such a career (a junior faculty appointment) a more egalitarian path forward based on documented performance with resources in hand, a process that is typically more objective than project review. This can only have a salutary effect in fostering a more diverse population of investigators. Nonetheless, special attention will need to be paid to ensuring that biases, subconscious or otherwise, do not skew the choices of new faculty or the retrospective renewal process.6.Mechanisms will be needed to deal with gaps in research careers or entry into the system other than as a starting faculty member. Interruption of a research career for short periods, for health or family reasons, shouldn’t exclude an individual from continuing to function as a PI. For those already successfully competing in the proposed system, it should be reasonably straightforward to craft mechanisms for postponing ongoing funding for short periods (a few years at most) and then restarting the flow of dollars when the individual returns to the laboratory. In other cases, individuals might wish to enter a research track later in their career, whether an M.D. moving from clinical work to research or someone who has been in a lab but not functioning as a PI. Two ways to accommodate such transitions could be easily imagined—allowing institutions to use some of their block funds to initiate research careers for these individuals, with the same post hoc review of the success of these choices, or reservation of a modest amount of funding for direct application in the style of the current R01 system. Keeping open the possibility of entry into a research career other than through the first hire funding scheme that is at the core of this proposal would help ensure that the system isn’t a “one size fits all” that excludes those who either come late to the “calling” or who may be on the border of award of a funded junior faculty position and need to prove their worth in the research arena to qualify for retrospective review funding going forward.7.Finally, although this proposal deals primarily with R01 funding, there will also need to be attention paid to other mechanisms used for research support. Large, collaborative efforts are necessary to attack certain problems. However, stronger requirements for data qualification, deposition, and sharing are essential for larger projects supported by such mechanisms as U01 or U19 awards, so that the substantial amount of money spent on such efforts benefits the entire research community and so that the growing cadre of bioinformaticians can re-use the data for potentially novel discoveries at the earliest possible time. I support such large efforts, but not in their current form—my experience is that too often, vast sums are consumed in disproportion to the advances made, and in many (most?) cases, the PIs feel that they should have exclusive ownership of the resources and data for an unreasonably long time. There should be stricter rules controlling when data are made available publicly and greater accountability to insure investment translates into outcome, especially when the activities do not involve creation of new technologies where success cannot be assured, but rather involve application of known methods on a large scale to an important problem (see the new NIH rules on data access for genomic information for efforts to move forward in this direction [National Institutes of Health, 2014National Institutes of Health (2014). NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-14-124.html.Google Scholar]). The issue of credit allocation and career advancement for individuals engaged in large, collaborative projects is also a crucial one but beyond the scope of this piece, though it may be instructive for readers to examine the revisions made in the past few years to the NIH Intramural Research Program tenure policy to specifically recognize the importance of team science in the biomedical research arena (National Institutes of Health, 2015bNational Institutes of Health (2015b). Criteria for Tenure at the NIH. https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/tenure-nih-intramural-research-program/criteria-tenure-nih.Google Scholar). I believe that, if changes along the lines I propose could be accomplished, the funds already available to the NIH would be put to much better use. The review process would become much less onerous, with salutary effects on the reviewers (and on who is willing to serve in such a position) and perhaps diminished administrative costs and more funds available for science itself. Indeed, review panels could be much more multi-disciplinary than at present because of the retrospective nature of the review that considers mainly published work and is not concerned with the discipline-specific nitty-gritty of how one would conduct a future study. Under such conditions, one does not necessarily need to be an expert in the field to contribute to evaluation of the portfolio of the person under review—this was the case with the HHMI when I was on the review board, where having a mix of expertise on the panel worked extremely well. This broadening of the review boards would decrease the perceived unevenness in the rigor with which grants that go to different study sections are reviewed, as well as reduce the effects of parochial thinking on the overall award pool and research portfolio. Many readers might suggest at this point that I have missed a key issue—the number of dollars devoted to biomedical research. Wouldn’t many of the problems I seek to rectify by this proposal be obviated if there were simply more money available? Others have already noted that as desirable as an increase in the NIH budget would be, especially a correction of the 25%–30% erosion in constant dollars that has occurred over the past decade, it is extremely unlikely that the problems afflicting the research enterprise can be solved in this manner (Alberts et al., 2014Alberts B. Kirschner M.W. Tilghman S. Varmus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 5773-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The reason is simple math—depending on what one considers the likely size of laboratories (reliable data are sparse and estimates range from as few as 3–4 to 10+, as seems to be the case from acknowledgment slides after talks at major meetings of even junior faculty speakers), then with 5 years on average in postdoctoral training, each PI is replicating herself or himself an average of every 6 months to a year. Even if this number is inflated by 2-fold due to second postdoc periods, drop-outs from the system, and non-trainee staff, and assuming that only 25% of fellows become PIs as has been reported (Rockey, 2012Rockey, S. (2012). So, What Does the Biomedical Research Workforce Look Like? http://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/06/22/so-what-does-the-biomedical-research-workforce-look-like/.Google Scholar), then the effective population doubling rate is every 4–8 years. I doubt any of us think that, however much of the GDP we feel should be devoted to biomedical research, the compound budget increases approaching the 12%–25% per year above inflation needed to sustain such growth are conceivable. The person-centric, block-grant system I propose would impose “natural” population control through limitations in the number of new laboratories formed and their size expansion over time. Together with other changes to the sociology of scientific training and to the structure of laboratory groups—more research associates/staff scientists, fewer trainees as mere hands in the lab—a better balance between potentially sustainable budget growth and expansion of research can be attained, while maintaining the creativity that comes in large part from the influx of new trainees and young investigators. At the same time, this rebalancing of the laboratory staff structure will improve research efficiency. These changes would also likely foster more collaboration, given the constraints of overall group size and the increasing appreciation that multidisciplinary efforts are often needed to make major advances. I am fairly sure we will not see the power law budget increase needed to keep up with the current explosive production of new scientists arising from ongoing practices, but I am perhaps unduly optimistic that, after a correction of the inflationary losses of the past several years, we may be able to attain an “inflation plus” growth rate that would support a robust research enterprise of the type I think we all envision and to which this change in funding strategy could contribute. A final point of tension is over the fraction of the budget devoted to basic versus translational or clinical research, with a fear among more basic investigators that the balance is shifting too far toward the latter (Wadman, 2012Wadman, M. (2012). NIH Director Grilled over Translational Research Centre. http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/03/nih-director-grilled-over-translational-research-center.html.Google Scholar). There is little doubt that successful translational work that improves human health (the end goal of the overall NIH mission) depends on new discoveries made in basic science laboratories, and strangling the latter will only diminish effective clinical advances. But it is also fair for the society that supports research to expect a return on its investment. Beyond the funding scheme changes that constitute the heart of this essay, I end by noting that there are ways to provide stable support to basic investigators while also recruiting their knowledge and talents more directly in support of the rapid movement of discoveries into the translational realm; indeed, some of the mechanisms for doing this can make basic scientists more aware of new areas ripe for study and also generate collaborative enterprises that together make for exciting and rewarding scientific interactions. If we are creative and open in our thinking about re-structuring not only the major support scheme for biomedical research from a project to a person-centric model as I propose, but also in how we organize our research efforts, it is not too difficult to imagine a future in which much of the angst about support and career stability can be turned into a new era of sustainable and rewarding research activities, one that satisfies the “seeker” in each scientist while providing society with the new knowledge and application of this information that it deserves for its support. This commentary grew out of discussions with my son David Russler-Germain, an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate at Washington University School of Medicine, about how rising biomedical investigators view the NIH grant system and a possible career in research. He played a major role in editing various drafts of the manuscript, pointing me to useful resources, and making sure I took a broader view of the issues, for all of which I am extremely grateful. Others who have provided helpful suggestions include Arturo Casadevall, Ron Vale, Jeff Miller, David Baltimore, Emilie Russler-Germain, and Gale Inoff-Germain.

Our objective was to determine whether vitamin D deficiency in older adults is associated with reduced thickness of the ganglion cell complex (GCC) and of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), as measured with high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT).Eighty-five French older community-dwellers without open-angle glaucoma and patent age-related macular degeneration (mean, 71.1±4.7 years; 45.9% female) from the GAIT study were separated into 2 groups according to serum 25OHD level (i.e., deficient≤25 nmol/L or sufficient>25 nmol/L). Measurements of GCC and RNFL thickness were performed using HD-OCT. Age, gender, body mass index, number of comorbidities, dementia, functional autonomy, intracranial volume, visual acuity, serum calcium concentration and season of testing were considered as potential confounders.Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 58.4±26.8 nmol/L. Mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.03±0.06. Mean visual field mean deviation was -1.25±2.29 dB. Patients with vitamin D deficiency (n=11) had a reduced mean GCC thickness compared to those without vitamin D deficiency (72.1±7.4 μm versus 77.5±7.5 μm, P=0.028). There was no difference of the mean RNFL thickness in these two groups (P=0.133). After adjustment for potential confounders, vitamin D deficiency was associated with reduced GCC thickness (ß=-5.12, P=0.048) but not RNFL thickness (ß=-9.98, P=0.061). Specifically, vitamin D deficiency correlated with the superior medial GCC area (P=0.017) and superior temporal GCC area (P=0.010).Vitamin D deficiency in older patients is associated with reduced mean GCC thickness, which can represent an early stage of optic nerve damage, prior to RNFL loss."
https://openalex.org/W2295810812,"Cdc14 phosphatase is a key regulator of exit from mitosis, acting primarily through antagonism of cyclin-dependent kinase, and is also thought to be important for meiosis. Cdc14 is released from its sequestration site in the nucleolus in two stages, first by the non-essential Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) pathway and later by the essential Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), which drives efficient export of Cdc14 to the cytoplasm. We find that Cdc14 is confined to the nucleus during early mitotic anaphase release, and during its meiosis I release. Proteins whose degradation is directed by Cdc14 as a requirement for mitotic exit (e.g. the B-type cyclin, Clb2), remain stable during mitotic FEAR, a result consistent with Cdc14 being restricted to the nucleus and not participating directly in mitotic exit. Cdc14 released by the FEAR pathway has been proposed to have a wide variety of activities, all of which are thought to promote passage through anaphase. Proposed functions of FEAR include stabilization of anaphase spindles, resolution of the rDNA to allow its segregation, and priming of the MEN so that mitotic exit can occur promptly and efficiently. We tested the model for FEAR functions using the FEAR-deficient mutation net1-6cdk. Our cytological observations indicate that, contrary to the current model, FEAR is fully dispensable for timely progression through a series of anaphase landmarks and mitotic exit, although it is required for timely rDNA segregation. The net1-6cdk mutation suppresses temperature-sensitive mutations in MEN genes, suggesting that rather than activating mitotic exit, FEAR either inhibits the MEN or has no direct effect upon it. One interpretation of this result is that FEAR delays MEN activation to ensure that rDNA segregation occurs before mitotic exit. Our findings clarify the distinction between FEAR and MEN-dependent Cdc14 activities and will help guide emerging quantitative models of this cell cycle transition."
https://openalex.org/W889199993,"The aim of this study was to investigate how perceived stress may affect electroencephalographical (EEG) activity in a stress paradigm in a sample of 76 healthy participants. EEG activity was analyzed using multilevel modeling, allowing estimation of nested effects (EEG time segments within subjects). The stress paradigm consisted of a 3-minute pre-stimulus stress period and a 2-minute post-stimulus phase. At t=3 minutes, a single electrical stimulus was delivered. Participants were unaware of the precise moment of stimulus delivery and its intensity level. In the EEG time course of alpha activity, a stronger increase was observed during the post-stimulus period as compared to the pre-stimulus period. An opposite time course effect was apparent for gamma activity. Both effects were in line with a priori expectations and support the validity of this experimental EEG-stress paradigm. Secondly, we investigated whether interaction effects of stress and coping, as measured with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 questionnaire (PSS-10), could be demonstrated. A higher perceived stress score was accompanied by a greater increase in delta- and theta-activity during the post-stimulus phase, compared to low scores. In contrast, low coping capacity was associated with a stronger decrease in slow beta, fast beta and gamma activity during the post-stimulus phase. The results of the present article may be interpreted as proof-of-principle that EEG stress-related activity depends on the level of subjectively reported perceived stress. The inclusion of psychosocial variables measuring coping styles as well as stress-related personality aspects permits further examination of the interconnection between mind and body and may inform on the process of transformation from acute to chronic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1887455712,"During the development of type 2 diabetes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to not only insulin resistance but also to pancreatic beta cell failure. Conversely, cell function under various stressed conditions can be restored by reducing ER stress by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, the details of this mechanism are still obscure. Therefore, the current study aims to elucidate the role of AMPK activity during ER stress-associated pancreatic beta cell failure. MIN6 cells were loaded with 5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) and metformin to assess the relationship between AMPK activity and CCAAT enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) expression levels. The effect of C/EBPβ phosphorylation on expression levels was also investigated. Vildagliptin and metformin were administered to pancreatic beta cell-specific C/EBPβ transgenic mice to investigate the relationship between C/EBPβ expression levels and AMPK activity in the pancreatic islets. When pancreatic beta cells are exposed to ER stress, the accumulation of the transcription factor C/EBPβ lowers the AMP/ATP ratio, thereby decreasing AMPK activity. In an opposite manner, incubation of MIN6 cells with AICAR or metformin activated AMPK, which suppressed C/EBPβ expression. In addition, administration of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin and metformin to pancreatic beta cell-specific C/EBPβ transgenic mice decreased C/EBPβ expression levels and enhanced pancreatic beta cell mass in proportion to the recovery of AMPK activity. Enhanced C/EBPβ expression and decreased AMPK activity act synergistically to induce ER stress-associated pancreatic beta cell failure."
https://openalex.org/W577464065,"Reviewer assignment is critical to peer review systems, such as peer-reviewed research conferences or peer-reviewed funding applications, and its effectiveness is a deep concern of all academics. However, there are some problems in existing peer review systems during reviewer assignment. For example, some of the reviewers are much more stringent than others, leading to an unfair final decision, i.e., some submissions (i.e., papers or applications) with better quality are rejected. In this paper, we propose a context-aware reviewer assignment for trust enhanced peer review. More specifically, in our approach, we first consider the research area specific expertise of reviewers, and the institution relevance and co-authorship between reviewers and authors, so that reviewers with the right expertise are assigned to the corresponding submissions without potential conflict of interest. In addition, we propose a novel cross-assignment paradigm, and reviewers are cross-assigned in order to avoid assigning a group of stringent reviewers or a group of lenient reviewers to the same submission. More importantly, on top of them, we propose an academic CONtext-aware expertise relevanCe oriEnted Reviewer cross-assignmenT approach (CONCERT), which aims to effectively estimate the ""true"" ratings of submissions based on the ratings from all reviewers, even though no prior knowledge exists about the distribution of stringent reviewers and lenient reviewers. The experiments illustrate that compared with existing approaches, our proposed CONCERT approach can less likely assign more than one stringent reviewers or lenient reviewers to a submission simultaneously and significantly reduce the influence of ratings from stringent reviewers and lenient reviewers, leading to trust enhanced peer review and selection, no matter what kind of distributions of stringent reviewers and lenient reviewers are."
https://openalex.org/W609285012,"The pneumococcal serine threonine protein kinase (StkP) acts as a global regulator in the pneumococcus. Bacterial mutants deficient in StkP are less virulent in animal models of infection. The gene for this regulator is located adjacent to the gene for its cognate phosphatase in the pneumococcal genome. The phosphatase dephosphorylates proteins phosphorylated by StkP and has been shown to regulate a number of key pneumococcal virulence factors and to modulate adherence to eukaryotic cells. The role of StkP in adherence of pneumococci to human cells has not previously been reported. In this study we show StkP represses the pneumococcal pilus, a virulence factor known to be important for bacterial adhesion. In a serotype 4 strain regulation of the pilus by StkP modulates adherence to human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human lung epithelial cells. This suggests that the pneumococcal pilus may play a role in adherence during infections such as meningitis and pneumonia. We show that regulation of the pilus occurs at the population level as StkP alters the number of pili-positive cells within a single culture. As far as we are aware this is the first gene identified outside of the pilus islet that regulates the biphasic expression of the pilus. These findings suggest StkPs role in cell division may be linked to regulation of expression of a cell surface adhesin."

We quantitatively evaluated the objective scattering index (OSI) using the double-pass instrument (OQAS II, Visiometrics) and corneal HOAs using Hartmann-Shack aberrometry (KR-9000PW, Topcon) 3 months postoperatively.The mean OSI, corneal HOAs, and logMAR BSCVA 3 months after DSAEK were 7.91 ± 3.58, 0.43 ± 0.27 μm, and 0.32 ± 0.25, respectively. We found a significant correlation between the OSI and logMAR BSCVA (Spearman correlation coefficient r=0.714, p<0.001), but no significant association between corneal HOAs and logMAR BSCVA 3 months postoperatively (r=0.209, p=0.267). We found no significant differences in any postoperative parameters between the DSAEK and n-DSAEK groups (p>0.05).Our pilot study demonstrated that the postoperative corrected visual acuity was significantly correlated with intraocular forward scattering, but not with corneal HOAs in post-DSAEK eyes, suggesting that intraocular forward scattering plays a more essential role in postoperative visual performance than corneal aberrations after DSAEK. The detailed visual performance, such as HOAs and intraocular scattering, after n-DSAEK appears to be essentially equivalent to that after DSAEK."
https://openalex.org/W572545817,"Respiratory rate (RR) is an important vital sign which is strongly correlated with in-hospital mortality. At the same time, RR is the most likely vital sign to be omitted when assessing a patient. We believe that one reason for this could be the difficulty in measure the RR, since it is not read off a monitor, but counted manually. Also there is the possibility of assessment bias and the inter-observer reliability becomes important. We therefore set out to investigate how the nursing staff counting the actual number of respirations per minute would agree with the nursing staff using a predefined ordinal scale.For this prospective study, we recorded five videos of a young healthy man breathing approximately 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 times per minute. The videos were shown in a random order to a suitable sample of the nursing staff. The participants were randomized into two groups; one to count the exact number of breaths per minute, and one to use a predefined ordinal scale.Comparing the exact number of breaths per minute, the Intra Class Coefficient (ICC) was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.97-1.00). Comparing the RR using the predefined scale, the overall Kappa Fleiss Coefficient was 0.75.The inter-observer agreement was high when comparing the use of the actual number of breaths per minute and substantial when comparing the use of the predefined scale. This is the largest inter-observer study on RR to date. However, further studies on the use of scaled comparisons of RR are needed."
https://openalex.org/W623216429,"Background Gastroesophageal reflux is overrepresented in people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and it has been suggested that OSA worsens gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Aggravated reflux might lead to an increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus. Aim To assess the association between sleep apnea symptoms and Barrett’s esophagus. Methods Included in a case-control study in Brisbane, Australia were 237 patients with histologically confirmed Barrett’s esophagus and 247 population controls. The controls were randomly selected from the electoral roll and frequency-matched to the cases by age and sex. Information on OSA symptoms (excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep related apnea symptoms), gastroesophageal reflux symptoms and anthropometric measures were collected through interviews and written questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression provided odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for potential confounding by BMI and gastroesophageal reflux. Results The prevalence of Barrett’s esophagus was higher among people with excessive daytime sleepiness than those without (24% vs. 18%; p-value 0.1142) and in participants with sleep-related apnea symptoms (20% vs. 13%; p-value 0.1730). However, there were non-significantly increased ORs of Barrett’s esophagus among people with excessive daytime sleepiness (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.90–2.34) and sleep related apnea symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.74–2.36) when adjusting for age, sex and BMI. After further adjustment for gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, the point ORs were no longer increased (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.61–1.70 for daytime sleepiness and OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.38–1.38 for sleep related apnea symptoms). Conclusions Symptoms of OSA are possibly associated with an increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus, an association that appears to be mediated entirely by gastroesophageal reflux."
https://openalex.org/W653615137,"Type 1 narcolepsy is caused by deficiency of hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin. An autoimmune basis is suspected, but no specific antibodies, either causative or as biomarkers, have been identified. However, the AS03 adjuvanted split virion H1N1 (H1N1-AS03) vaccine, created to protect against the 2009 Pandemic, has been implicated as a trigger of narcolepsy particularly in children. Sera and CSFs from 13 H1N1-AS03-vaccinated patients (12 children, 1 young adult) with type 1 narcolepsy were tested for autoantibodies to known neuronal antigens including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), both associated with encephalopathies that include disordered sleep, to rodent brain tissue including the lateral hypothalamus, and to live hippocampal neurons in culture. When sufficient sample was available, CSF levels of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) were measured. Sera from 44 H1N1-ASO3-vaccinated children without narcolepsy were also examined. None of these patients’ CSFs or sera was positive for NMDAR or CASPR2 antibodies or binding to neurons; 4/13 sera bound to orexin-neurons in rat brain tissue, but also to other neurons. MCH levels were a marginally raised (n = 8; p = 0.054) in orexin-deficient narcolepsy patients compared with orexin-normal children (n = 6). In the 44 H1N1-AS03-vaccinated healthy children, there was no rise in total IgG levels or in CASPR2 or NMDAR antibodies three weeks following vaccination. In conclusion, there were no narcolepsy-specific autoantibodies identified in type 1 narcolepsy sera or CSFs, and no evidence for a general increase in immune reactivity following H1N1-AS03 vaccination in the healthy children. Antibodies to other neuronal specific membrane targets, with their potential for directing use of immunotherapies, are still an important goal for future research."

Self-reported alexithymia was correlated with number (r = .42, p < .01) and intensity of current somatoform symptoms (r = .36, p < .01), but unrelated to observer-rated alexithymia (r = .11, p = .42).Results indicate a faster allocation of attentional resources away from task-irrelevant information towards illness-related stimuli in alexithymia. Considering the close relationship between alexithymia and somatization, these findings are compatible with the theoretical view that alexithymics focus strongly on bodily sensations of emotional arousal. A single observer rating (OAS) does not seem to be an adequate alexithymia-measure in community samples."
https://openalex.org/W1709534931,"We have previously identified homologs for nearly half of the approximately 30 known yeast Atg's in the genome database of the human sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei. So far, only a few of these homologs have their role in autophagy experimentally confirmed. Among the candidates was the ortholog of Atg24 that is involved in pexophagy in yeast. In T. brucei, the peroxisome-like organelles named glycosomes harbor core metabolic processes, especially glycolysis. In the autotrophic yeast, autophagy is essential for adaptation to different nutritional environments by participating in the renewal of the peroxisome population. We hypothesized that autophagic turnover of the parasite's glycosomes plays a role in differentiation during its life cycle, which demands adaptation to different host environments and associated dramatic changes in nutritional conditions. We therefore characterized T. brucei ATG24, the T. brucei ortholog of yeast Atg24 and mammalian SNX4, and found it to have a regulatory role in autophagy and differentiation as well as endocytic trafficking. ATG24 partially localized on endocytic membranes where it was recruited via PI3-kinase III/VPS34. ATG24 silencing severely impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis of transferrin, but not adsorptive uptake of a lectin, and caused a major enlargement of the flagellar pocket. ATG24 silencing approximately doubled the number of autophagosomes, suggesting a role in repressing autophagy, and strongly accelerated differentiation, in accordance with a role of autophagy in parasite differentiation. Overexpression of the two isoforms of T. brucei ATG8 fused to GFP slowed down differentiation, possibly by a dominant-negative effect. This was overcome by ATG24 depletion, further supporting its regulatory role."
https://openalex.org/W2213797542,"The influence of age on the performance of percent free prostate-specific antigen (%fPSA) in diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) in East Asians is controversial. We tested the diagnostic performance of %fPSA in a multi-center biopsy cohort in China and identified the proper age-specific cutoff values to avoid unnecessary biopsies.Consecutive patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 4.0-10.0 ng/ml or 10.1-20.0 ng/ml who underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided or transperineal prostate biopsy were enrolled from 22 Chinese medical centers from Jan 1, 2010 to Dec 31, 2013. The diagnostic accuracy of PSA and %fPSA was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Age-specific cutoff values were calculated using ROC curve analysis.The median %fPSA was much lower in younger patients compared with older patients with a PSA level of 4.0-10.0 ng/ml or 10.1-20.0 ng/ml. The AUC of %fPSA was higher than PSA only in older patients. In patients aged 50 to 59 years, %fPSA failed to improve the diagnosis compared with PSA in these two PSA ranges. Age-specific cutoff values were 24%, 27% and 32% for patients aged 60-69, 70-79 and ≥80 years, respectively, to reduce unnecessary biopsies in men with PSA levels of 4.0-10.0 ng/ml to detect 90% of all PCa.The effectiveness of %fPSA is correlated with age in the Chinese population. Age-specific cutoff values would help avoid unnecessary biopsies in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W590289202,"In order to investigate how holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) improves urinary storage symptoms, we assessed blood flow in the urinary bladder mucosa of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) before and after laser surgery. Seventy-four consecutive patients with BPH (median age 69 years, range; 53-88) underwent HoLEP at our institution and are included in this study. We prospectively assessed the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-QOL Score, the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), uroflowmetry, and blood flow in the urinary bladder, before and after surgery. Blood flow in the bladder mucosa was measured using the OMEGA FLOW (OMEGAWAVE, Tokyo, Japan) laser Doppler flowmeter. The median volume of the enucleated adenomas was 45.0 g (range: 25.0 to 83.2). The median IPSS improved significantly from 20 (range: 6-35) to 3 (0-22) (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test), as did the storage symptoms score, which decreased from 13 (2-20) to 3 (1-8) (p < 0.001). Median bladder blood flow increased at the trigone from 9.57 ± 0.83 ml/sec to 17.60 ± 1.08 ml/sec. Multiple regression analysis for the improved storage symptom score eliminated all explanatory variables except increased bladder perfusion. The data suggest that HoLEP improves blood flow in the bladder mucosa, which independently leads to the improvement of storage symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W639438969,"Summer temperature extremes over the global land area were investigated by comparing 26 models of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) with observations from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the Climate Research Unit (CRU). Monthly data of the observations and models were averaged for each season, and statistics were calculated for individual models before averaging them to obtain ensemble means. The summers with temperature anomalies (relative to 1951–1980) exceeding 3σ (σ is based on the local internal variability) are defined as “extremely hot”. The models well reproduced the statistical characteristics evolution, and partly captured the spatial distributions of historical summer temperature extremes. If the global mean temperature increases 2°C relative to the pre-industrial level, “extremely hot” summers are projected to occur over nearly 40% of the land area (multi-model ensemble mean projection). Summers that exceed 5σ warming are projected to occur over approximately 10% of the global land area, which were rarely observed during the reference period. Scenarios reaching warming levels of 3°C to 5°C were also analyzed. After exceeding the 5°C warming target, “extremely hot” summers are projected to occur throughout the entire global land area, and summers that exceed 5σ warming would become common over 70% of the land area. In addition, the areas affected by “extremely hot” summers are expected to rapidly expand by more than 25%/°C as the global mean temperature increases by up to 3°C before slowing to less than 16%/°C as the temperature continues to increase by more than 3°C. The area that experiences summers with warming of 5σ or more above the warming target of 2°C is likely to maintain rapid expansion of greater than 17%/°C. To reduce the impacts and damage from severely hot summers, the global mean temperature increase should remain low."

https://openalex.org/W2158835752,"Predicting the locations of future surface coal mining in Appalachia is challenging for a number of reasons. Economic and regulatory factors impact the coal mining industry and forecasts of future coal production do not specifically predict changes in location of future coal production. With the potential environmental impacts from surface coal mining, prediction of the location of future activity would be valuable to decision makers. The goal of this study was to provide a method for predicting future surface coal mining extents under changing economic and regulatory forecasts through the year 2035. This was accomplished by integrating a spatial model with production demand forecasts to predict (1 km2) gridded cell size land cover change. Combining these two inputs was possible with a ratio which linked coal extraction quantities to a unit area extent. The result was a spatial distribution of probabilities allocated over forecasted demand for the Appalachian region including northern, central, southern, and eastern Illinois coal regions. The results can be used to better plan for land use alterations and potential cumulative impacts."
https://openalex.org/W825742739,"The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 consists of 10 exons and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor. There are four major WT1 isoforms resulting from alternative splicing at two sites, exon 5 (17AA) and exon 9 (KTS). All major WT1 isoforms are overexpressed in leukemia and solid tumors and play oncogenic roles such as inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In the present study, a novel alternatively spliced WT1 isoform that had an extended exon 4 (designated as exon 4a) with an additional 153 bp (designated as 4a sequence) at the 3' end was identified and designated as an Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform. The insertion of exon 4a resulted in the introduction of premature translational stop codons in the reading frame in exon 4a and production of C-terminal truncated WT1 proteins lacking zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Overexpression of the truncated Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform inhibited the major WT1-mediated transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL gene promoter and induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Conversely, suppression of the Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform by Ex4a-specific siRNA attenuated apoptosis. These results indicated that the Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform exerted dominant negative effects on anti-apoptotic function of major WT1 isoforms. Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform was endogenously expressed as a minor isoform in myeloid leukemia and solid tumor cells and increased regardless of decrease in major WT1 isoforms during apoptosis, suggesting the dominant negative effects on anti-apoptotic function of major WT1 isoforms. These results indicated that Ex4a(+)WT1 isoform had an important physiological function that regulated oncogenic function of major WT1 isoforms."

https://openalex.org/W2149402781,"TAE226, a bis-anilino pyrimidine compound, has been developed as an inhibitor of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR). In this study, we investigated the effect of TAE226 on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially focusing on the EGFR mutational status. TAE226 was more effective against cells with mutant EGFR, including the T790M mutant, than against cells with wild-type one. TAE226 preferentially inhibited phospho-EGFR and its downstream signaling mediators in the cells with mutant EGFR than in those with wild-type one. Phosphorylation of FAK and IGF-IR was not inhibited at the concentration at which the proliferation of EGFR-mutant cells was inhibited. Results of the in vitro binding assay indicated significant differences in the affinity for TAE226 between the wild-type and L858R (or delE746_A750) mutant, and the reduced affinity of ATP to the L858R (or delE746_A750) mutant resulted in good responsiveness of the L858R (or delE746_A750) mutant cells to TAE226. Of interest, the L858R/T790M or delE746_A750/T790M mutant enhanced the binding affinity for TAE226 compared with the L858R or delE746_A750 mutant, resulting in the effectiveness of TAE226 against T790M mutant cells despite the T790M mutation restoring the ATP affinity for the mutant EGFR close to that for the wild-type. TAE226 also showed higher affinity of about 15-fold for the L858R/T790M mutant than for the wild-type one by kinetic interaction analysis. The anti-tumor effect against EGFR-mutant tumors including T790M mutation was confirmed in mouse models without any significant toxicity. In summary, we showed that TAE226 inhibited the activation of mutant EGFR and exhibited anti-proliferative activity against NSCLCs carrying EGFR mutations, including T790M mutation."

Their spectral changes induced by the environment could be used to understand their interaction with biomolecules as well as for analytical purposes. Spectral shifts, quantum yield and changes in lifetime are presented for the free form of alkaloids in solvents of different polarity and for alkaloids bound to DNA. Quantum yields range from 0.098 to 0.345 for the alkanolamine form and are below 0.033 for the iminium form. Rise of fluorescence lifetimes (from 2-5 ns to 3-10 ns) and fluorescence intensity are observed after binding of the iminium form to the DNA for most studied alkaloids. The alkanolamine form does not bind to DNA. Acid-base equilibrium constant of macarpine is determined to be 8.2-8.3. Macarpine is found to have the highest increase of fluorescence upon DNA binding, even under unfavourable pH conditions. This is probably a result of its unique methoxy substitution at C12 a characteristic not shared with other studied alkaloids. Association constant for macarpine-DNA interaction is 700000 M(-1)."

Recent volunteer efforts have made it possible to establish colonies of the now-rare C. novemnotata and test mechanisms contributing to its decline. We evaluated the relative frequencies of intraguild predation and cannibalism of eggs between these two species. A single C. novemnotata or C. septempunctata adult was exposed to conspecific and heterospecific eggs in either the presence or absence of pea aphids. The study revealed two expected results: 1) eggs of C. novemnotata were consumed more frequently than eggs of C. septempunctata by both species, and 2) egg consumption was higher when aphids were absent, independent of predator and egg species. There were also two unexpected results from the study: 1) the asymmetry between egg predation rates was higher when aphids were present, and 2) higher predation rates on C. novemnotata eggs in the absence of alternate prey was due to a relatively higher rate of intraspecific cannibalism. This implies that C. novemnotata would have suffered higher egg mortality rates before the invasion of C. septempunctata, but even though the aggregate rate of egg predation on C. novemnotata eggs is lower post-invasion, it is still significantly higher than the aggregate rate of predation of C. septempunctata eggs. This differential pattern of asymmetric predation could contribute to habitat compression and the overall decline of C. novemnotata."

https://openalex.org/W1769550371,"Research on long-term health effects of earthquakes is scarce, especially in low- and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by disasters. To date, progress in this area has been hampered by the lack of tools to accurately measure these effects. Here, we explored whether long-term public health effects of earthquakes can be assessed using a combination of readily available data sources on public health and geographic distribution of seismic activity.We used childhood stunting as a proxy for public health effects. Data on stunting were attained from Demographic and Health Surveys. Earthquake data were obtained from U.S. Geological Survey's ShakeMaps, geographic information system-based maps that divide earthquake affected areas into different shaking intensity zones. We combined these two data sources to categorize the surveyed children into different earthquake exposure groups, based on how much their area of residence was affected by the earthquake. We assessed the feasibility of the approach using a real earthquake case--an 8.4 magnitude earthquake that hit southern Peru in 2001.Our results indicate that the combination of health survey data and disaster data may offer a readily accessible and accurate method for determining the long-term public health consequences of a natural disaster. Our work allowed us to make pre- and post-earthquake comparisons of stunting, an important indicator of the well-being of a society, as well as comparisons between populations with different levels of exposure to the earthquake. Furthermore, the detailed GIS based data provided a precise and objective definition of earthquake exposure. Our approach should be considered in future public health and disaster research exploring the long-term effects of earthquakes and potentially other natural disasters."

Specimens of B. caudata from the northern hemisphere (mainland Asia) and southern hemisphere (Indonesia) were analysed using the partial DNA sequences of the nuclear 28S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS-2) genes, and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) and 16S rRNA genes. The COI, COII, 16S rDNA and concatenated COI+COII+16S and COI+COII+16S+28S+ITS-2 nucleotide sequences revealed that B. caudata from the northern hemisphere (Peninsular Malaysia, East Malaysia, Thailand) was distinctly different from the southern hemisphere (Indonesia: Java, Bali and Lombok), without common haplotype between them. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clades (northern and southern hemispheres), indicating distinct genetic lineage. The uncorrected 'p' distance for the concatenated COI+COII+16S nucleotide sequences between the taxa from the northern and southern hemispheres ('p' = 4.46-4.94%) was several folds higher than the 'p' distance for the taxa in the northern hemisphere ('p' = 0.00-0.77%) and the southern hemisphere ('p' = 0.00%). This distinct difference was also reflected by concatenated COI+COII+16S+28S+ITS-2 nucleotide sequences with an uncorrected 'p' distance of 2.34-2.69% between the taxa of northern and southern hemispheres. In accordance with the type locality the Indonesian taxa belong to the nominal species. Thus the taxa from the northern hemisphere, if they were to constitute a cryptic species of the B. caudata species complex based on molecular data, need to be formally described as a new species. The Thailand and Malaysian B. caudata populations in the northern hemisphere showed distinct genetic structure and phylogeographic pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1501621132,"Mathematical models in ecology and epidemiology often consider populations “at equilibrium”, where in-flows, such as births, equal out-flows, such as death. For stochastic models, what is meant by equilibrium is less clear – should the population size be fixed or growing and shrinking with equal probability? Two different mechanisms to implement a stochastic steady state are considered. Under these mechanisms, both a predator-prey model and an epidemic model have vastly different outcomes, including the median population values for both predators and prey and the median levels of infection within a hospital (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). These results suggest that the question of how a stochastic steady state is modeled, and what it implies for the dynamics of the system, should be carefully considered."
https://openalex.org/W2139621415,"Introduction The first identification of swine-originated influenza A/CA/04/2009 (pH1N1) as the cause of an outbreak of human influenza accelerated efforts to develop vaccines to prevent and control influenza viruses. The current norm in many countries is to prepare influenza vaccines using cell-based or egg-based killed vaccines, but it is difficult to elicit a sufficient immune response using this approach. To improve immune responses, researchers have examined the use of cytokines as vaccine adjuvants, and extensively investigated their functions as chemoattractants of immune cells and boosters of vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we evaluated the effect of Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GmCSF) as an influenza vaccine adjuvant in BALB/c mice. Method and Results Female BALB/c mice were immunized with killed vaccine together with a murine GmCSF gene delivered by human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope coated baculovirus (1×107 FFU AcHERV-GmCSF, i.m.) and were compared with mice immunized with the killed vaccine alone. On day 14, immunized mice were challenged with 10 median lethal dose of mouse adapted pH1N1 virus. The vaccination together with GmCSF treatment exerted a strong adjuvant effect on humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, the vaccinated mice together with GmCSF were fully protected against infection by the lethal influenza pH1N1 virus. Conclusion Thus, these results indicate that AcHERV-GmCSF is an effective molecular adjuvant that augments immune responses against influenza virus."
https://openalex.org/W917407836,"It is important to cluster heterogeneous information networks. A fast clustering algorithm based on an approximate commute time embedding for heterogeneous information networks with a star network schema is proposed in this paper by utilizing the sparsity of heterogeneous information networks. First, a heterogeneous information network is transformed into multiple compatible bipartite graphs from the compatible point of view. Second, the approximate commute time embedding of each bipartite graph is computed using random mapping and a linear time solver. All of the indicator subsets in each embedding simultaneously determine the target dataset. Finally, a general model is formulated by these indicator subsets, and a fast algorithm is derived by simultaneously clustering all of the indicator subsets using the sum of the weighted distances for all indicators for an identical target object. The proposed fast algorithm, FctClus, is shown to be efficient and generalizable and exhibits high clustering accuracy and fast computation speed based on a theoretic analysis and experimental verification."
https://openalex.org/W2303720130,"The precise prediction of protein intrinsically disordered regions, which play a crucial role in biological procedures, is a necessary prerequisite to further the understanding of the principles and mechanisms of protein function. Here, we propose a novel predictor, DisoMCS, which is a more accurate predictor of protein intrinsically disordered regions. The DisoMCS bases on an original multi-class conservative score (MCS) obtained by sequence-order/disorder alignment. Initially, near-disorder regions are defined on fragments located at both the terminus of an ordered region connecting a disordered region. Then the multi-class conservative score is generated by sequence alignment against a known structure database and represented as order, near-disorder and disorder conservative scores. The MCS of each amino acid has three elements: order, near-disorder and disorder profiles. Finally, the MCS is exploited as features to identify disordered regions in sequences. DisoMCS utilizes a non-redundant data set as the training set, MCS and predicted secondary structure as features, and a conditional random field as the classification algorithm. In predicted near-disorder regions a residue is determined as an order or a disorder according to the optimized decision threshold. DisoMCS was evaluated by cross-validation, large-scale prediction, independent tests and CASP (Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction) tests. All results confirmed that DisoMCS was very competitive in terms of accuracy of prediction when compared with well-established publicly available disordered region predictors. It also indicated our approach was more accurate when a query has higher homologous with the knowledge database. Availability The DisoMCS is available at http://cal.tongji.edu.cn/disorder/."
https://openalex.org/W1560359030,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified over 20 genomic regions associated with disease risk. Many of these loci include several candidate genes making it difficult to pinpoint the causal gene. The locus on chromosome 2q24.3 encompasses three genes: B3GALT1, STK39, and CERS6. In order to identify if the causal variants are simple missense changes, we sequenced all 31 exons of these three genes in 187 patients with PD. We identified 13 exonic variants including four non-synonymous and three insertion/deletion variants (indels). These non-synonymous variants and rs2102808, the GWAS tag SNP, were genotyped in three independent series consisting of a total of 1976 patients and 1596 controls. Our results show that the seven identified 2q24.3 coding variants are not independently responsible for the GWAS association signal at the locus; however, there is a haplotype, which contains both rs2102808 and a STK39 exon 1 6bp indel variant, that is significantly associated with PD risk (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.11-1.64, P = 0.003). This haplotype is more associated than each of the two variants independently (OR = 1.23, P = 0.005 and 1.10, P = 0.10, respectively). Our findings suggest that the risk variant is likely located in a non-coding region. Additional sequencing of the locus including promoter and regulatory regions will be needed to pinpoint the association at this locus that leads to an increased risk to PD."
