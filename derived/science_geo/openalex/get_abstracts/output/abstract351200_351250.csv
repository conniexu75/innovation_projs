We have harnessed antiphase oscillating proteins that mark cell-cycle transitions in order to develop genetically encoded fluorescent probes for this purpose. These probes effectively label individual G1 phase nuclei red and those in S/G2/M phases green. We were able to generate cultured cells and transgenic mice constitutively expressing the cell-cycle probes, in which every cell nucleus exhibits either red or green fluorescence. We performed time-lapse imaging to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of cell-cycle dynamics during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cultured cells, the migration and differentiation of neural progenitors in brain slices, and the development of tumors across blood vessels in live mice. These mice and cell lines will serve as model systems permitting unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution to help us better understand how the cell cycle is coordinated with various biological events.

These mice and cell lines will serve as model systems permitting unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution to help us better understand how the cell cycle is coordinated with various biological events. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding the mechanism of cell-cycle progression in individual cells (Nurse et al., 1998Nurse P. Masui Y. Hartwell L. Understanding the cell cycle.Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1103-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Nurse, 2000Nurse P. A long twentieth century of the cell cycle and beyond.Cell. 2000; 199: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (427) Google Scholar). However, the cell cycle is regulated not only by intracellular signals, but also by extracellular signals, and less is known about how the cell cycle is coordinated with differentiation, morphogenesis, and cell death in a multicellular context. While the transition from M to G1 phase—namely cell division—can be monitored by morphological changes, the transition from G1 to S is difficult to observe in live samples. To date, the G1/S transition has mostly been observed either after nuclear bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining, or by synchronizing the cell cycle by pharmacological means. Recently, several cell-cycle markers that identify the S phase and the subsequent transition to G2 in live cells have been developed by fusing fluorescent proteins to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Leonhardt et al., 2000Leonhardt H.

Cell cycle markers for live cell analyses.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or the C terminus of helicase B (GE healthcare). However, since identification of cell-cycle transitions requires the detection of subtle and often minute changes in the distribution pattern and intensity of fluorescence signals, these markers cannot track phase transitions with high contrast. In addition to being regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, the cell cycle is controlled by ubiquitin (Ub)-mediated proteolysis (Figure 1A) (Ang and Harper, 2004Ang X.L. Harper J.W. Interwoven ubiquitination oscillators and control of cell cycle transitions.Sci. STKE. 2004; 242: pe31Google Scholar, Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Ubiquitin ligases: cell-cycle control and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The APCCdh1 and SCFSkp2 complexes are E3 ligase activities that mark a variety of proteins with Ub in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Vodermaier, 2004Vodermaier H.C. APC/C and SCF: Controlling each other and the cell cycle.Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R787-R796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the SCFSkp2 complex is a direct substrate of the APCCdh1 complex but also functions as a feedback inhibitor of APCCdh1 (Wei et al., 2004Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.-J. Kirschner M.W.

Pagano M. Involvement of the SCF complex in the control of Cdh1 degradation in S phase.Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1230-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these two ligase activities oscillate reciprocally during the cell cycle. The APCCdh1 complex is active in the late M and G1 phases, while the SCFSkp2 complex is active in the S and G2 phases. Two direct substrates of the APCCdh1 and SCFSkp2 complexes, Geminin and Cdt1, are involved in “licensing” of replication origins (Nishitani et al., 2000Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. The Cdt1 protein is required to license DNA for replication in fission yeast.Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This carefully regulated process ensures that replication occurs only once in a cell cycle. In higher eukaryotes, proteolysis and Geminin-mediated inhibition of the licensing factor Cdt1 are essential for preventing re-replication. Due to cell cycle-dependent proteolysis, protein levels of Geminin and Cdt1 oscillate inversely. Western blot analysis of synchronized cultured cells has shown that Cdt1 levels are highest during G1, while Geminin levels are highest during the S, G2, and M phases (Nishitani et al., 2004Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Proteolysis of DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 in S-phase is performed independently of geminin through its N-terminal region.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this study, we harnessed the regulation of cell cycle-dependent ubiquitination in order to develop two genetically encoded indicators for cell-cycle progression. We fused red- and green-emitting fluorescent proteins to E3 ligase substrates, Cdt1 and Geminin, to develop dual-color fluorescent probes that indicate whether individual live cells are in G1 phase or S/G2/M phases (Figure 1B). First, a fast-folding variant of mKO (monomeric version of Kusabira Orange) (Karasawa et al., 2004Karasawa S. Araki T. Nagai T. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. Cyan-emitting and orange-emitting fluorescent proteins as a donor/acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) was generated (H.O.S. Karasawa and A.M., unpublished data) and named mKO2. mKO2 was fused to full-length human Cdt1 (hCdt1) (Figure 1C, [1–546]). When the chimeric protein was expressed in HeLa cells under the control of the ubiquitous CMV promoter, red fluorescence was observed in the nuclei of a fraction of cells. Cells were then time-lapse imaged using computer-assisted fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, LCV100). Cell morphology was monitored by differential interference contrast (DIC) to follow cell division. During the first 48 hr after transfection, we observed a sudden disappearance of red fluorescence, suggesting that mKO2-hCdt1 protein was being degraded by the SCFSkp2 complex at the onset of S phase. However, after 48 more hours, we noticed that the transfected cells failed to proceed to mitosis, whereas nontransfected cells divided normally. This is consistent with the fact that overexpression of hCdt1 causes re-replication of DNA (Vaziri et al., 2003Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Su Hwang D. Dutta A.

Preventing re-replication of chromosomal DNA.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In addition, we were unable to obtain any healthy stable transformants expressing the chimeric protein. To overcome the cell-cycle arrest, numerous hCdt1 deletion mutants were constructed and fused to mKO2 (Figure 1C), then evaluated for cell cycle-dependent red fluorescence in the nucleus by time-lapse imaging. As expected, the Cy motif (amino acids 68 – 70), which binds to the SCFSkp2 E3 ligase (Nishitani et al., 2006Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Fujita M. et al.Two E3 ubiquitin ligases, SCF-Skp2 and DDB1-Cul4, target human Cdt1 for proteolysis.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1126-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), was required for proper function. Although the N-terminus of hCdt1 (amino acids 1–10) binds to a different E3 ligase (Cul4) (Senga et al., 2006Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. PCNA is a cofactor for Cdt1 degradation by CUL4/DDB1-mediated N-terminal ubiquitination.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Nishitani et al., 2006Nishitani H. Sugimoto N. Roukos V. Nakanishi Y. Saijo M. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K.

Since Cdt1 degradation by the SCFSkp2 complex has been shown to be independent of its binding to Geminin (Lee et al., 2004Lee C. Hong B.S. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S.

Cdt1 phosphorylation by cyclin A-dependent kinases negatively regulates its function without affecting Geminin binding.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we also removed the Geminin-binding region. The resulting truncated hCdt1 protein (amino acids 30–120) is sufficient for marking cells in G1 phase [mKO2-hCdt1(30/120), Figure 1C]. Interestingly, mKO2 in mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) could not be replaced with mAG (the monomeric version of Azami Green) (Karasawa et al., 2003Karasawa S. Araki T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Miyawaki A. A green-emitting fluorescent protein from Galaxeidae coral and its monomeric version for use in fluorescent labeling.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34167-34171Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), mEGFP, or mRFP1; the use of these latter fluorescent proteins resulted in constant fluorescence signal throughout the cell cycle (Figure 1C). Like Cdt1, the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 is ubiquitinated by the SCFSkp2 complex. Since a p27-luciferase (p27Luc) fusion protein can be used to monitor Cdk2 inhibitor pharmacodynamics in vivo (Zhang et al., 2004Zhang G.-J. Safran M. Wei W. Sorensen E. Lassota P. Zhelev N. Neuberg D.S. Shapiro G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Bioluminescent imaging of Cdk2 inhibition in vivo.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we attempted to fuse fluorescent proteins to p27 or the p27 domains recognized by ubiquitin ligase, but none of the fusions produced bright, cell cycle-dependent fluorescence comparable to that observed with mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) (data not shown). Next, mKO2 was fused to truncated versions of human Geminin (hGem) (Figure 1D) and tested as described for mKO2-hCdt1. A chimeric protein composed of mKO2 and the 110 amino acid N-terminus of hGem [mKO2-hGem(1/110)] showed the best performance among the constructs tested. It should be noted that mKO2-hGem(1/110) also lacks the Cdt1 binding region (Lee et al., 2004Lee C. Hong B.S. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Kim Y. Cho Y. Structual basis for inhibition of the replication licencing factor Cdt1 by geminin.Nature. 2004; 430: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Unlike hCdt1(30/120), hGem(1/110) could be fused to several other fluorescent proteins. mAG was substituted to generate a green version, mAG-hGem(1/110) (Figure 1D). We next used lentiviral vectors for coexpression of the two constructs in HeLa cells. Since this gene-transfer technique is highly efficient, cotransduction allowed us to obtain stable transformants expressing equivalent levels of mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) and mAG-hGem(1/110). In each transformant, red fluorescence alternated with green fluorescence in the nucleus (Movie S1 available online). A typical time series is shown in Figure 1E. The cell-cycle period was variable, presumably due to differences in cell density and serum concentration. Since the green fluorescence disappeared rapidly in late M phase and the red fluorescence became detectable in early G1 phase, a small gap in fluorescence was observed in newborn daughter cells. By contrast, during red-to-green conversion, red and green fluorescence always overlapped to yield a yellow nucleus. To examine whether the timing of the color conversion correlates with the onset of S phase, transformants were pulse-labeled with BrdU for five minutes and immediately immunostained for BrdU. Typical confocal images of cells at the G1/S transition and in the G1, S, G2, and M phases are shown in Figure 1F (see Figures S1A–S1D for a wide-field image). Since all of the cells with yellow nuclei showed BrdU incorporation, the emergence of the green fluorescence is indicative of the initiation of the S phase. Similar results were obtained from a separate experiment in which we immunostained for PCNA (Bravo and Macdonald-Bravo, 1987Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. Existence of two populations of cyclin/proliferating cell nuclear antigen during the cell cycle: Association with DNA replication sites.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) (Figure S1E). Cells with nuclei emitting pure green fluorescence were also observed. These cells were either in the S or G2 phase, and were distinguishable by nuclear BrdU or PCNA immunostaining. These results are consistent with the fact that Cdt1 accumulates in G1, while Geminin accumulates in S/G2/M phases. We named this fluorescent, ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, “Fucci.” Analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry revealed the same distribution between Fucci-expressing and parental HeLa cells (Figure 1G, left). Cells expressing Fucci were divided into red-, yellow-, and green-emitting populations [mKO2(+)mAG(-), mKO2(+)mAG(+), mKO2(-)mAG(+), respectively] (Figure 1G, middle), and their DNA contents were analyzed following Hoechst33342 staining. Green and yellow cells had fully- and partially-replicated complements of DNA, respectively (Figure 1G, right). Thus, differential profiling of cells at G1 and S/G2/M phases can be achieved by sorting a population of cells into red, yellow, or green and examining various cellular functions, such as gene expression and antigen surface expression. Stable transformants constitutively expressing Fucci were obtained using other cell lines, including normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, PC12 cells, and COS7 cells. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental morphogenetic process by which mesenchymal cells are formed from epithelia during embryonic development, wound repair, and tumor progression in multicellular organisms (Thiery and Sleeman, 2006Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3059) Google Scholar). In vitro EMT is characterized by dissolution of cell-cell junctions, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and increased motility of cultured cells. It is possible that specific stages of the cell cycle are involved in the process. Indeed, it was recently reported that transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) efficiently induced EMT in AML-12 hepatocytes synchronized at the G1/S phase, but not in cells synchronized at the G2/M phase (Yang et al., 2006Yang Y. Pan X. Lei W. Wang J. Song J. Transforming growth factor-β1 induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and apoptosis via a cell cycle-dependent mechanism.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7235-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, NMuMG cells undergo EMT in response to TGFβ (Piek et al., 1999Piek E. Moustakas A. Kurisaki A. Heldin C.H. Dijke P. TGF-β type I receptor / ALK-5 and Smad proteins mediate epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation in NMuMG breast epithelial cells.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4557-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tojo et al., 2005Tojo M. Hamashima Y. Hanyu A. Kajimoto T. Saitoh M. Miyazono K. Noda M. Imamura T. The ALK-5 inhibitor A-83–01 inhibits Smad signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by transforming growth factor-β.Cancer Sci. 2005; 96: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To examine cell-cycle progression during EMT, we examined Fucci-expressing, stably transformed NMuMG cells. After cells were plated on a glass coverslip, they proliferated as clusters maintaining cell-cell adhesion with their neighbors (Figure 2A, 1 hr). The high proliferation rate of these cells was evidenced by the large fraction of cells with green nuclei (Figure 2A, 25–49 hr). However, at confluence, the green nuclei were replaced with red nuclei (Figure 2A, 73 hr), indicating that cells remained in G1 phase (Movie S2, left). When we introduced a wound in the confluent monolayer (Figure 2C, 1 hr), cells at the edge of the wound turned green (Figure 2C, 13 hr, arrows), indicating that closure of the wound required proliferation of NMuMG cells. Notably, the green nuclei appeared 9-13 hr after wound induction. Such a time delay of more than 8 hr was reproducibly observed in other similar wound healing experiments and is reminiscent of the 8 hr required for NIH 3T3 cells to re-enter the cycle from a state of quiescence (G0) after the onset of proliferation stimuli (Zetterberg and Larsson, 1985Zetterberg A. Larsson O. Kinetic analysis of regulatory events in G1 leading to proliferation of quiescence of Swiss3T3 cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1985; 82: 5365-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the confluent NMuMG cells (Figure 2A, 85 hr) remained in G0 phase. Next, we performed the same experiments in the presence of 1 ng/ml of TGFβ. Within one day following TGFβ treatment, the number of cells with green nuclei increased (Figure 2B, 1–49 hr), indicating that this ligand induced a G1/S transition. Subsequently, cells began to adopt a spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like morphology and high motility (Figure 2B, 49 hr). After two days of TGFβ treatment, the number of cells with green nuclei diminished, reflecting the G1 arrest effect of TGFβ (Figure 2B, 49–85 hr) (Movie S2, right). Thus, TGFβ-treated cells spread without proliferation, in contrast with the untreated NMuMG cells, which were densely packed in a confluent monolayer. In addition, the introduction of a wound did not result in proliferation, but rather a further expansion of cells (Figure 2D). Whole-body and intravital cellular imaging of mice injected with cultured tumor cells genetically labeled with fluorescent proteins has proven to be a powerful technique for investigating tumor development (Hoffman, 2005Hoffman R.M. In vivo cell biology of cancer cells visualized with fluorescent proteins.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 70: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, Yamauchi et al., 2006Yamauchi K. Yang M. Jiang P. Xu M. Yamamoto N. Tsuchiya H. Tomita K. Moossa A.R. Bouvet M. Hoffman R.M. Development of real-time subcellular dynamic multicolor imaging of cancer-cell trafficking in live mice with a variable-maginification whole-mouse imaging system.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4208-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We tested whether or not Fucci could be used to monitor tumor development by subcutaneously injecting Fucci-expressing NMuMG cells into the mammary fat pad of nude mice (Figure 3A). One day after inoculation, both green and red cells were observed (Figure 3B). After 16 days, however, only red cells were seen (Figure 3C), indicating that NMuMG cells are nontumorigenic. Next, Fucci-expressing HeLa cells were injected in a similar fashion into nude mice (Figure 3D). The injected cells gradually grew and emitted both green and red fluorescence for a month, suggesting tumor progression (Figures 3E and 3F). The expanded mass was observed through the skin under a microscope (Olympus, IV100, 10×, UplanFL N N.A. = 0.30) 27 days after injection (Figure 3G). Well-developed tumor vessels were visualized by loading AngioSense750, which emits far-red fluorescence. Although triple-color live imaging identified HeLa cells in G1 and S/G2 phases, their positions relative to the vessels were not clear due to the low spatial resolution. The tumor was fixed, sectioned, and stained with an antibody against CD31. Both the red and green fluorescence of Fucci remained after conventional immunostaining procedures, including fixation in 4% PFA. The cell-cycle phase pattern of HeLa cells around blood vessels was clearly visualized (Figure 3H). The pattern appeared to depend on several factors, including the maturity of vessels and the degree of necrosis in the surrounding tissues. A statistical analysis is underway to investigate these relationships. Next, cell-cycle progression of tumor cells was examined during the initial steps of the classic metastatic cascade, such as adhesion to endothelial cells and extravasation. Fucci-expressing HeLa cells in a gel were injected into a skin vein (Figure S2), and intravital cellular imaging was performed. Interestingly, at early stages, nearly all of the cells attached to the inner wall of the veins were in G1 phase (Figures 3I and 3J). We captured an image of a cell in the process of extravasation (Figures 3K, 3L, and 3M). Within a cluster of HeLa cells across a vein wall, an elongated cell with a yellow, fragmented nucleus was observed to pass through the wall. Four days postinjection, HeLa cells were found to invade and proliferate over the veins (Figures 3N and 3O), suggesting multiple occurrences of extravasation. Previous work showed that cultured cells with differentially labeled cytoplasm and nuclei that were injected into mice could be used to image nuclear-cytoplasmic dynamics in order to monitor cancer cell trafficking, deformation, extravasation, mitosis, and cell death in live mice (Yang et al., 2003Yang M. Li L. Jiamg P. Moossa A.R. Penman S. Hoffman R.M. Dual-color fluorescence imaging distinguishes tumor cells from induced host angiogenic vessels and stromal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 14259-14262Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In combination with these cytoplasmic labeling techniques, fluorescence imaging of stably transformed Fucci-expressing cells injected into live animals will provide reliable pharmacodynamic readouts for the growth and metastatic behavior of tumors. One major advantage of our genetically encoded probe is that it need not depend on transcriptional regulation; its transcription can be driven using constitutive promoters. Thus, we can easily generate transgenic organisms for cell cycle analysis. Using the CAG promoter (Niwa et al., 1991Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4424) Google Scholar), we have made transgenic mouse lines that ubiquitously express mKO2-hCdt1(30/120). From 16 mouse lines emitting red fluorescence, #596 was selected for further characterization. We also made eight green fluorescent mAG-hGem(1/110) mouse lines from which #504 was chosen for further characterization. These mouse lines provide us with an unprecedented model system with which to study the coordination of the cell cycle and development. #504 is particularly useful because it provides in vivo information about proliferation patterns. During early development of the mammalian cerebral cortex, neural progenitors in the ventricular zone (VZ) undergo expansion. To determine whether mAG-hGem(1/110) green fluorescence is produced by neural progenitors, we performed immunohistochemistry on telencephalic sections of an embryonic day (E)14 #504 transgenic embryo. Since the telencephalic cells with green nuclei were immunopositive for Nestin but not MAP2 (Figure S3), these cells were likely to be neural progenitors. Next, we crossbred #596 and #504 transgenic mice to generate a mouse line producing Fucci, in which every somatic cell nucleus exhibited either red or green fluorescence. We fixed an E13 Fucci transgenic embryo and prepared coronal sections of the brain. Red and green fluorescence was examined in every section using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fluorescence images of three representative sections are shown in Figures 4A, 4E, and 4I. The red and green signals appear to be well balanced at the embryonic stage, but the overall ratio of green-to-red signal decreases as the mice grow (data not shown). In the developing cerebral cortex (Figures 4B, 4F, 4G, and 4J), nuclei emitting red mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) fluorescence were identified in two main cell populations: mitotic neural progenitors in the VZ and postmitotic neurons destined to populate different layers in the cortical plate (CP). The postmitotic neurons exhibited much brighter red fluorescence, probably due to accumulation of mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) after cell-cycle exit. The bright red nuclei of blood vessels were also visible in the VZ of the dorsal telencephalon (Figures 4B and 4F). It is interesting to note that in the diencephalon there was a stripe of cells in G1 phase, which corresponded to the zona limitans intrathalamica (zli). The dorsal thalamus contained more green nuclei than the ventral thalamus (Figures 4I and 4J), which suggests that cells in the ventral region undergo cell-cycle exit for differentiation prior to those in the dorsal region. The differential intensity of red fluorescence between mitotic and postmitotic cells was observed also in the developing neuroepithelia of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems (Figures 4C and 4D, respectively) and the retina (Figure 4H). The random distribution of high- and low-intensity fluorescent nuclei may suggest that the architecture of the olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia is not yet established at E13. In contrast, bright red nuclei were observed in the central apical region of the developing retina (Figure 4H), whose developing retinal ganglion cells undergo centrifugal differentiation (Neumann and Nuesslein-Volhard, 2000Neumann C.J. Nuesslein-Volhard C. Patterning of the zebrafish retina by a wave of sonic hedgehog activity.Science. 2000; 289: 2137-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The epithelial cells of the lens had also exited the cell cycle by this stage. Other extra-neural tissues with bright red fluorescence include the trigeminal ganglion (Figure 4K) and pituitary gland (Figure 4L). Coronal sections of mouse embryos (E13) were also examined immunohistochemically. Proliferation was visualized by nuclear immunostaining for BrdU (Figure S4) or PCNA (Figure S5). PCNA images were merged with fluorescence images of mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) to indicate neuronal differentiation.

Interleukin-22 (IL-22) and IL-17A are both effector cytokines produced by the T(H)17 lineage, and both were crucial for maintaining local control of the Gram-negative pulmonary pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although both cytokines regulated CXC chemokines and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor production in the lung, only IL-22 increased lung epithelial cell proliferation and increased transepithelial resistance to injury.

Serine-3 of ghrelin is acylated with an eight-carbon fatty acid, octanoate, which is required for its endocrine actions. Here, we identify GOAT (Ghrelin O-Acyltransferase), a polytopic membrane-bound enzyme that attaches octanoate to serine-3 of ghrelin. Analysis of the mouse genome revealed that GOAT belongs to a family of 16 hydrophobic membrane-bound acyltransferases that includes Porcupine, which attaches long-chain fatty acids to Wnt proteins. GOAT is the only member of this family that octanoylates ghrelin when coexpressed in cultured endocrine cell lines with prepro-ghrelin. GOAT activity requires catalytic asparagine and histidine residues that are conserved in this family. Consistent with its function, GOAT mRNA is largely restricted to stomach and intestine, the major ghrelin-secreting tissues. Identification of GOAT will facilitate the search for inhibitors that reduce appetite and diminish obesity in humans."

Here we perform genome-wide RNA-interference screening to identify 17 genes required for an activated BRAF oncogene (BRAFV600E) to block proliferation of human primary fibroblasts and melanocytes. Surprisingly, we find a secreted protein, IGFBP7, has a central role in BRAFV600E-mediated senescence and apoptosis. Expression of BRAFV600E in primary cells leads to synthesis and secretion of IGFBP7, which acts through autocrine/paracrine pathways to inhibit BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling and induce senescence and apoptosis. Apoptosis results from IGFBP7-mediated upregulation of BNIP3L, a proapoptotic BCL2 family protein. Recombinant IGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) induces apoptosis in BRAFV600E-positive human melanoma cell lines, and systemically administered rIGFBP7 markedly suppresses growth of BRAFV600E-positive tumors in xenografted mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of human skin, nevi, and melanoma samples implicates loss of IGFBP7 expression as a critical step in melanoma genesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110769281,"Treatment of neuropathic pain, triggered by multiple insults to the nervous system, is a clinical challenge because the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain development remain poorly understood. Most treatments do not differentiate between different phases of neuropathic pain pathophysiology and simply focus on blocking neurotransmission, producing transient pain relief. Here, we report that early- and late-phase neuropathic pain development in rats and mice after nerve injury require different matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). After spinal nerve ligation, MMP-9 shows a rapid and transient upregulation in injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary sensory neurons consistent with an early phase of neuropathic pain, whereas MMP-2 shows a delayed response in DRG satellite cells and spinal astrocytes consistent with a late phase of neuropathic pain. Local inhibition of MMP-9 by an intrathecal route inhibits the early phase of neuropathic pain, whereas inhibition of MMP-2 suppresses the late phase of neuropathic pain. Further, intrathecal administration of MMP-9 or MMP-2 is sufficient to produce neuropathic pain symptoms. After nerve injury, MMP-9 induces neuropathic pain through interleukin-1beta cleavage and microglial activation at early times, whereas MMP-2 maintains neuropathic pain through interleukin-1beta cleavage and astrocyte activation at later times. Inhibition of MMP may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain at different phases."

However, targeting of liver cells by adenoviruses compromises their potential efficacy. In cell culture, the adenovirus serotype 5 fiber protein engages the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) to bind cells. Paradoxically, following intravascular delivery, CAR is not used for liver transduction, implicating alternate pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that coagulation factor (F)X directly binds adenovirus leading to liver infection. Here, we show that FX binds to the Ad5 hexon, not fiber, via an interaction between the FX Gla domain and hypervariable regions of the hexon surface. Binding occurs in multiple human adenovirus serotypes. Liver infection by the FX-Ad5 complex is mediated through a heparin-binding exosite in the FX serine protease domain.

The generation of positional information during development and adult life is crucial for processes ranging from global patterning of the embryo to building of tissues and organs and their maintenance. Positional information is often established by factors that spread from a defined source, thereby providing the basis for differential cellular response along a gradient. The graded distribution of molecules can dictate different fates in response to the signal level at the position where the responding cells reside (e.g., (Driever and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1988Driever W.

A particularly challenging task is controlling cell migration during early development, a phase during which a large-scale reorganization of embryonic structures results in displacement of sources of guidance cues as well as tissues that serve as substrate on which cells migrate. Determining the strategies that allow cells to reach their target during these stages is thus a major biological question, the answer to which is likely to shed light on the mechanisms governing directed cell migration under less demanding conditions at other time points in the life of the organism. A useful model for studying guided migration in vivo during early embryogenesis is that of primordial germ cells (PGCs), cells that typically migrate from their site of specification to the position where the gonad develops where they differentiate into gametes (reviewed in Kunwar et al., 2006Kunwar P.S. Siekhaus D.E. Lehmann R. In vivo migration: a germ cell perspective.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 237-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PGC migration in zebrafish is well understood, particularly since the guidance cue (the chemokine SDF-1a [Doitsidou et al., 2002Doitsidou M. Reichman-Fried M. Stebler J. Koprunner M. Dorries J.

Specifically, the migration route of the PGCs is tightly correlated with dynamic changes in the mRNA expression pattern of the chemoattractant SDF-1a (Doitsidou et al., 2002Doitsidou M. Reichman-Fried M. Stebler J. Koprunner M. Dorries J. Meyer D. Esguerra C.V. Leung T. Raz E.

The demonstration that CXCR7 is a receptor for SDF-1 (Balabanian et al., 2005Balabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y. Harriague J. Moepps B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thelen M. Bachelerie F.

Med. 2006; 203: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) ended the seemingly monogamous relationships between this chemokine and its first-to-be-identified receptor CXCR4. In vitro studies aimed at determining the function of CXCR7 yielded conflicting results. Whereas one study suggested that CXCR7 activation promotes cell migration (Balabanian et al., 2005Balabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y. Harriague J. Moepps B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thelen M. Bachelerie F. The chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 binds to and signals through the orphan receptor RDC1 in T lymphocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35760-35766Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), a more recent study argues that activation of this receptor is not involved in migration. According to the latter work, CXCR7 does not induce calcium mobilization, which normally characterizes the biochemical response to chemokine binding (Burns et al., 2006Burns J.M. Summers B.C. Wang Y. Melikian A. Berahovich R. Miao Z. Penfold M.E. Sunshine M.J. Littman D.R. Kuo C.J. et al.A novel chemokine receptor for SDF-1 and I-TAC involved in cell survival, cell adhesion, and tumor development.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2201-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Last, in agreement with the results presented above, both CXCR7 ligands, CXCL11 and CXCL12, failed to induce calcium signaling, nor could they promote phosphorylation of either ERK1/2 or Akt/PKB (Proost et al., 2007Proost P. Mortier A. Loos T. Vandercappellen J. Gouwy M. Ronsse I. Schutyser E. Put W. Parmentier M. Struyf S. Van Damme J. Proteolytic processing of CXCL11 by CD13/aminopeptidase N impairs CXCR3 and CXCR7 binding and signaling and reduces lymphocyte and endothelial cell migration.Blood. 2007; 110: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Irrespective of its biochemical activity, CXCR7 function was found to be essential for proper migration of the posterior lateral line primordium, proving that this receptor indeed participates in controlling cell migration in vivo (Dambly-Chaudière et al., 2007Dambly-Chaudière C. Cubedo N. Ghysen A. Control of cell migration in the development of the posterior lateral line: antagonistic interactions between the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7/RDC1.BMC Dev.

Biol. 2007; 17: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Yet, the precise contribution of the receptor to the control of guided cell migration is not known. To determine the role CXCR7 plays in vivo, we examined its function in the context of zebrafish PGC migration. In this work we show that in embryos in which CXCR7 function is compromised, PGCs exhibit strongly impaired cell polarity and faulty migration. Strikingly, unlike the other SDF-1a receptor, CXCR4b, whose function is required within the migrating cells, CXCR7 function is exerted primarily in somatic cells. We provide evidence suggesting that CXCR7 effectively reduces the level of SDF-1a available for PGCs by binding and internalizing the chemokine and thus serves to sequester it. In this way, CXCR7 lowers the level of the chemoattractant in the environment, thereby permitting rapid dynamic changes in the distribution of the protein in response to alterations in the transcription pattern of sdf-1a. Zebrafish PGCs initiate their active migration toward SDF-1a at 4.5 hr postfertilization (hpf) (Blaser et al., 2005Blaser H. Eisenbeiss S. Neumann M. Reichman-Fried M. Thisse B. Thisse C. Raz E. Transition from non-motile behaviour to directed migration during early PGC development in zebrafish.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4027-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and reach their final target within the next 15 hr (Weidinger et al., 1999Weidinger G. Wolke U. Koprunner M. Klinger M. Raz E. Identification of tissues and patterning events required for distinct steps in early migration of zebrafish primordial germ cells.Development. 1999; 126: 5295-5307Google Scholar, Weidinger et al., 2002Weidinger G. Wolke U. Koprunner M. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raz E. Regulation of zebrafish primordial germ cell migration by attraction towards an intermediate target.Development. 2002; 129: 25-36Google Scholar). In situ hybridization and RT-PCR revealed that cxcr7 RNA is not provided maternally (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1I) and is transcribed throughout the embryo just before the onset of PGC migration (3.3 hpf, Figures 1C and 1D). During gastrulation stages, the receptor is expressed in a ring of deep cells (6 hpf, Figures 1E and 1F), followed by low-level expression and uniform distribution along with stronger expression in specific structures in the nervous system and in mesodermal derivatives (Figures 1G and 1H). Unlike the distinct expression of cxcr4b in PGCs (Doitsidou et al., 2002Doitsidou M. Reichman-Fried M. Stebler J. Koprunner M. Dorries J. Meyer D. Esguerra C.V. Leung T. Raz E. Guidance of primordial germ cell migration by the chemokine SDF-1.Cell. 2002; 111: 647-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), we did not observe specific prominent expression of cxcr7 in migrating PGCs. Thus, while it is possible that cxcr7 RNA is expressed in PGCs during early stages of development when its expression domain overlaps the location of the PGCs, it is not detectable in the germ cells at later stages (Figures 1G and 1H, encircled domains). To determine whether CXCR7 plays a role in the migration of PGCs, we have knocked down its activity using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Effective targeted gene ‘knockdown’ in zebrafish.Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). Strikingly, PGC migration was severely affected in embryos compromised for the receptor function. The CXCR7 loss-of-function phenotype is reminiscent of that of CXCR4b-deficient embryos such that by the end of the first day of development, PGCs failed to form cell clusters at the region where the gonad develops (Figures 2A–2C). This phenotype is likely to reflect defects in cell migration rather than an adverse effect on cell differentiation or survival as the PGCs in manipulated embryos show normal expression of various RNA markers such as nanos1 and h1m (Köprunner et al., 2001Köprunner M. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raz E. A zebrafish nanos-related gene is essential for the development of primordial germ cells.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2877-2885PubMed Google Scholar, Müller et al., 2002Müller K. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raz E. Expression of a linker histone-like gene in the primordial germ cells in zebrafish.Mech. Dev. 2002; 117: 253-257Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C and data not shown). In addition, PGCs in treated embryos were able to protect and translate specific mRNAs (Köprunner et al., 2001Köprunner M. Thisse C. Thisse B. Raz E. A zebrafish nanos-related gene is essential for the development of primordial germ cells.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2877-2885PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2F), formed the typical perinuclear granules (Wolke et al., 2002Wolke U. Weidinger G. Köprunner M. Raz E. Multiple levels of post-transcriptional control lead to germ line specific gene expression in the zebrafish.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 289-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Figure 2F), and exhibited normal proliferation (Figure 2I). Importantly, by reducing the activity of CXCR7, the distribution of sdf-1a transcripts was not altered, but the PGCs appeared to be uncharacteristically located outside of the RNA expression domains of the chemokine (Figures 2G and 2H). To verify that the observed PGC migration phenotype indeed resulted specifically from knockdown of CXCR7 function, we have injected the antisense oligonucleotides, while uniformly coexpressing cxcr7 mRNA mutated in a way that rendered it resistant to the inhibition. The introduction of cxcr7 mRNA into embryos by injection could not mimic the endogenous expression pattern or level of the receptor and therefore did not result in a complete suppression of the phenotype. Nevertheless, this treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the severity of the phenotype, demonstrating that the CXCR7 function is required for proper migration of the PGCs (Figures 2K–2L). The finding that cxcr7 is not specifically expressed in the PGCs, coupled with the fact that the severity of the knockdown phenotype is significantly reduced by uniform expression of the receptor in the embryo, could indicate that the receptor function is required in the somatic environment rather than in the PGCs themselves. To examine this possibility, we transplanted PGCs from embryos knocked down for CXCR7 into wild-type embryos and compared their ability to reach the target with that of wild-type cells transplanted into CXCR7-depleted embryos. As shown in Figures 2M–2Q, the ability of PGCs to reach their target depends on CXCR7 function in somatic cells. Specifically, PGCs transplanted into a wild-type somatic environment exhibited a high rate of arrival at the target (Figures 2M, 2N, and 2Q). In contrast, most of the PGCs transplanted into a CXCR7-depleted environment failed to reach the region where the gonad develops (Figures 2O, 2P, and 2Q). Importantly, CXCR7 knockdown within PGCs (Figures 2N, 2P, and 2Q) did not significantly affect the efficiency with which they arrived at their target (p > 0.17, two-sided t test). Together, these findings support the idea that CXCR7 function is required in somatic cells rather than in the PGCs. To determine the role CXCR7 plays in somatic cells, we have studied the subcellular localization of the protein and compared it with that of CXCR4b and SDF-1a. To this end, we have tagged these molecules with fluorescent proteins without affecting their normal activity (see Minina et al., 2007Minina S. Reichman-Fried M. Raz E. Control of receptor internalization, signaling level, and precise arrival at the target in guided cell migration.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar for CXCR4b, Figure S2 for CXCR7, and Movie S1 for SDF-1a) and followed their distribution within the cells. Interestingly, we found that in contrast to CXCR4b that is largely localized to the plasma membrane (Figure 3A), CXCR7 is enriched in intracellular structures (Figure 3B). These findings raised the possibility that CXCR7 binds SDF-1a and, as a result of internalization, sequesters the chemokine in the cell. CXCR7 could thus affect the shape of the SDF-1a gradient by reducing the level of the chemokine in the extracellular space. We have previously shown that high levels of SDF-1a in the environment trigger the internalization of CXCR4b in germ cells (Minina et al., 2007Minina S. Reichman-Fried M. Raz E. Control of receptor internalization, signaling level, and precise arrival at the target in guided cell migration.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Using the subcellular localization of CXCR4b as a measure for the amount of SDF-1a outside of the cells, we determined the distribution of this receptor under conditions where CXCR7 levels were reduced. Indeed, knocking down CXCR7 significantly lowered the level of CXCR4b on the plasma membrane (Figure 3C). In addition, introducing antisense oligonucleotides directed against sdf-1 reduced the level of CXCR4b internalization observed in CXCR7-deficient embryos (Figure 3C, right panel). These findings support the notion that the enhanced CXCR4b internalization in CXCR7 morphants results from higher levels of extracellular SDF-1. To directly address this idea, we followed the fate of GFP-tagged SDF-1a protein when it encounters cells expressing CXCR7 (Figure 3D). Indeed, a marked internalization of SDF-1a by somatic cells expressing CXCR7 was observed (right panel), whereas nontreated cells or cells overexpressing CXCR4b did not exhibit internalization of the tagged SDF-1a (left and middle panels, respectively). Importantly, in a similar experimental setting, we observed strict colocalization of SDF-1a-EGFP and CXCR7-DsRedMonomer (Figure 3E), supporting the idea that SDF-1a internalization is mediated by CXCR7. To examine the fate of the internalized SDF-1a protein, we compared the localization of the protein with that of the lysosomal marker LAMP-1. For this purpose we transplanted cells expressing CXCR7 and DsRed-tagged LAMP-1 into SDF-1a-EGFP-expressing hosts and detected SDF-1a accumulation in many of the labeled lysosomes (Figure 3F). Similar results were obtained when the lysosomes were labeled using the LysoTracker reagent (Figure S3). These results suggest that CXCR7 could reduce the time the chemokine is present in the extracellular space, thus permitting the formation of a gradient as well as dynamic alterations in the distribution of the molecule during development. To test this hypothesis more directly, we have assayed the potency of cells expressing CXCR7 in depleting SDF-1a from their environment. In this experiment, SDF-1a-conditioned medium was incubated with human cells expressing zebrafish CXCR7, and the activity level in inducing CXCR4b internalization served as a measure for the remaining amount of the chemokine. Indeed, cells expressing CXCR7 effectively depleted SDF-1a from the medium as compared with the cells transfected with an empty vector or cells expressing CXCR4b (Figures 3G–3K). The results presented above suggest that CXCR7 reduces the level of SDF-1a in the embryo allowing proper generation of the chemokine gradient. Detailed morphological analysis of PGCs migrating within the CXCR7-depleted environment strongly supports this idea. Specifically, in contrast with their morphology in wild-type embryos (Figure 4A, upper panels, and Movie S2), PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos appear less polarized, such that protrusion formation is not focused at the leading edge of the cell, but rather could be observed simultaneously at two opposite sides of the cell (Figure 4A, lower panels, and Movie S3). Further evidence for the reduced polarity of PGCs in CXCR7-depleted embryos was obtained by interfering with calcium polarity in the cells. Expressing an activated form of the STIM1 protein in PGCs elevates calcium levels in the rear of migrating cells and challenges their calcium polarity (Blaser et al., 2006Blaser H. Reichman-Fried M. Castanon I. Dumstrei K. Marlow F.L. Kawakami K. Solnica-Krezel L. Heisenberg C.P. Raz E. Migration of zebrafish primordial germ cells: a role for Myosin contraction and cytoplasmic flow.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 613-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Whereas wild-type PGCs expressing mutated STIM1 are still able to polarize and migrate (Movie S4) (Blaser et al., 2006Blaser H. Reichman-Fried M. Castanon I. Dumstrei K. Marlow F.L. Kawakami K.

Cell. 2006; 11: 613-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), a similar manipulation in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos resulted in a dramatic loss of PGC morphological polarity and motility (Movie S5). We consider this finding a further indication for the reduced polarity of PGCs migrating in manipulated embryos. To validate the notion that the basis for the phenotype of CXCR7 knockdown lies with higher levels of SDF-1 in the environment, we examined PGC behavior in manipulated embryos. PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos exhibited strong inhibition of motility manifested in short migration tracks (Figure 4B). This phenotype could be mimicked by global SDF-1a expression in otherwise wild-type embryos (Figure 4B). A striking reversal of the CXCR7 knockdown phenotype was observed when CXCR7 and both ligands (SDF-1a and SDF-1b) were simultaneously knocked down; experimental cells exhibited motility similar to cells lacking the guidance cue (Figure 4B) (Doitsidou et al., 2002Doitsidou M.

Suppression of the CXCR7 phenotype was similarly achieved by concomitant knockdown of CXCR4b (Figure 4B). Although PGCs in these experiments regained motility, they were nevertheless dispersed throughout the embryos (data not shown), since by knocking down CXCR4b or SDF-1 (along with CXCR7), the guidance signal was eliminated. We reasoned that a mild reduction in SDF-1a level might permit cell motility in embryos lacking CXCR7, while preserving the function of the chemokine as a guidance cue. In such a case, one would predict that treating CXCR7 morphants with low levels of sdf-1a morpholino should allow many PGCs to reach their target. Indeed, such a manipulation reduced the severity of the migration phenotype observed in 24 hpf embryos (Figure 4C). To determine whether the effect of CXCR7 on SDF-1a distribution is accompanied by signaling through the ligand-bound receptor, we have tested the possible involvement of two key pathways acting downstream of chemokine receptors, namely elevation in calcium levels and PI3K activation (e.g., Andrews et al., 2007Andrews S.

We found that CXCR7 knockdown had no effect on the level of calcium in somatic cells (Figure 5A). In addition, in embryos in which PI3K activity was inhibited using Wortmannin (as evident by membrane-to-cytoplasm translocation of Akt-PH-EGFP), PGCs maintained their polarity and migrated actively, unlike PGCs in CXCR7 knocked-down embryos, which exhibit defects in motility and cell polarity (Figure 5B and Movies S6 and S7). Last, despite the apparently high-binding affinity of CXCR7 to SDF-1 in the mammalian system (Balabanian et al., 2005Balabanian K. Lagane B. Infantino S. Chow K.Y. Harriague J. Moepps B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thelen M. Bachelerie F. The chemokine SDF-1/CXCL12 binds to and signals through the orphan receptor RDC1 in T lymphocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35760-35766Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), the zebrafish CXCR7 cannot substitute for CXCR4b. Specifically, preferential expression of CXCR7 in PGCs did not suppress the CXCR4b knockdown phenotype (Figure 5C). Consistent with previous findings (Burns et al., 2006Burns J.M. Summers B.C.

To demonstrate that somatically expressed CXCR7 affects the distribution of SDF-1a in the tissues within which the PGCs migrate, we have generated embryos in which SDF-1a was uniformly expressed and superimposed an uneven distribution of CXCR7 (Figure 6A). We found that the PGCs were preferentially located within domains lacking CXCR7, suggesting that the receptor affected the local SDF-1a concentration, promoting PGC migration toward regions where higher levels of SDF-1a are present (Figure 6B). To visualize the dynamic response of the PGCs to cells expressing CXCR7, we have examined the effect of CXCR7-expressing cells on the migration of PGCs toward an SDF-1a source (Figures 6C and 6D and Movies S10 and S11). PGCs rapidly and effectively migrated toward cells expressing the chemokine, while ignoring control cells transplanted on their way to the source (Figures 6C, upper panels, and 6D, left panel). In a striking contrast, transplantation of CXCR7-expressing cells (red cells in Figure 6C) between the PGCs and the chemokine source (blue cells in Figure 6C) dramatically affected the migration path of the PGCs such that they rarely crossed the CXCR7 expression field (Figures 6C, lower panels, cells 2 and 3, white tracks; and 6D, right panel). Consistently, expression of high levels of CXCR7 in the germ cells themselves affected thei"
https://openalex.org/W1965674737,"Background Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) should enable novel insights into early human development and provide a renewable source of cells for regenerative medicine. However, because the three-dimensional hESC aggregates [embryoid bodies (hEB)] typically employed to reveal hESC developmental potential are heterogeneous and exhibit disorganized differentiation, progress in hESC technology development has been hindered. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a centrifugal forced-aggregation strategy in combination with a novel centrifugal-extraction approach as a foundation, we demonstrated that hESC input composition and inductive environment could be manipulated to form large numbers of well-defined aggregates exhibiting multi-lineage differentiation and substantially improved self-organization from single-cell suspensions. These aggregates exhibited coordinated bi-domain structures including contiguous regions of extraembryonic endoderm- and epiblast-like tissue. A silicon wafer-based microfabrication technology was used to generate surfaces that permit the production of hundreds to thousands of hEB per cm2. Conclusions/Significance The mechanisms of early human embryogenesis are poorly understood. We report an ultra high throughput (UHTP) approach for generating spatially and temporally synchronised hEB. Aggregates generated in this manner exhibited aspects of peri-implantation tissue-level morphogenesis. These results should advance fundamental studies into early human developmental processes, enable high-throughput screening strategies to identify conditions that specify hESC-derived cells and tissues, and accelerate the pre-clinical evaluation of hESC-derived cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132397441,"Cytoplasmic polyadenylation plays a key role in the translational control of mRNAs driving biological processes such as gametogenesis, cell-cycle progression, and synaptic plasticity. What determines the distinct time of polyadenylation and extent of translational control of a given mRNA, however, is poorly understood. The polyadenylation-regulated translation is controlled by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) and its binding protein, CPEB, which can assemble both translational repression or activation complexes. Using a combination of mutagenesis and experimental validation of genome-wide computational predictions, we show that the number and relative position of two elements, the CPE and the Pumilio-binding element, with respect to the polyadenylation signal define a combinatorial code that determines whether an mRNA will be translationally repressed by CPEB, as well as the extent and time of cytoplasmic polyadenylation-dependent translational activation."
https://openalex.org/W2021408028,"Plant innate immunity relies on the recognition of pathogen effector molecules by nucleotide-binding-leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) immune receptor families. Previously we have shown the N immune receptor, a member of TIR-NB-LRR family, indirectly recognizes the 50 kDa helicase (p50) domain of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) through its TIR domain. We have identified an N receptor-interacting protein, NRIP1, that directly interacts with both N's TIR domain and p50. NRIP1 is a functional rhodanese sulfurtransferase and is required for N to provide complete resistance to TMV. Interestingly, NRIP1 that normally localizes to the chloroplasts is recruited to the cytoplasm and nucleus by the p50 effector. As a consequence, NRIP1 interacts with N only in the presence of the p50 effector. Our findings show that a chloroplastic protein is intimately involved in pathogen recognition. We propose that N's activation requires a prerecognition complex containing the p50 effector and NRIP1."
https://openalex.org/W2078577465,"MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that influence gene regulatory networks by post-transcriptional regulation of specific messenger RNA targets. MicroRNA expression is dysregulated in human malignancies, frequently leading to loss of expression of certain microRNAs. We report that expression of hsa-miR-342, a microRNA encoded in an intron of the gene EVL, is commonly suppressed in human colorectal cancer. The expression of hsa-miR-342 is coordinated with that of EVL and our results indicate that the mechanism of silencing is CpG island methylation upstream of EVL. We found methylation at the EVL/hsa-miR-342 locus in 86% of colorectal adenocarcinomas and in 67% of adenomas, indicating that it is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis. In addition, we observed a higher frequency of methylation (56%) in histologically normal colorectal mucosa from individuals with concurrent cancer compared to mucosa from individuals without colorectal cancer (12%), suggesting the existence of a 'field defect' involving methylated EVL/hsa-miR-342. Furthermore, reconstitution of hsa-miR-342 in the colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 induced apoptosis, suggesting that this microRNA could function as a proapoptotic tumor suppressor. In aggregate, these results support a novel mechanism for silencing intronic microRNAs in cancer by epigenetic alterations of cognate host genes."

A key function of the liver is the metabolism and elimination of xenobiotics or endobiotics. The expression of genes involved in these processes is largely regulated by transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family. Pregnane X receptor (PXR 2The abbreviations used are:PXRpregnane X receptorAsOantisense oligonucleotideCARconstitutive androstane receptormiRNAmicro-RNARXRαretinoid X receptor αUTRuntranslated regionRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesnRNAsmall nuclear RNA.; alternate names SXR, PAR, and NR1I2), a member of the nuclear receptor family, is a crucial regulator of drug metabolism and elimination. It is predominantly expressed in liver and small intestine. PXR is activated by a broad spectrum of xenobiotics, including antibiotics, antimycotics, and herbal components (1Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar); dimerizes with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα); and binds to response elements of target genes, including cytochrome P450s, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, glutathione S-transferases, sulfotransferases, and various transporters, such as MDR1 (multidrug resistance 1) and MRP-2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) to induce them (2Meijerman I. Beijnen J.H. Schellens J.H. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, PXR is recognized as a xenosensor for the detoxification of foreign compounds. However, it also plays a role as a physiological sensor of bile acids to protect the body from toxicity by regulating the expression of target genes that decreases the synthesis and increases the elimination of bile acids (3Staudinger J.L.

One of the best known genes regulated by PXR is CYP3A4, the most abundant P450 in human liver that catalyzes the metabolism of over 50% of current prescription drugs (5Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). A large interindividual difference (∼50-fold) has been reported for the CYP3A4 level in the general population (8Ozdemir V. Kalowa W. Tang B.K. Paterson A.D. Walker S.E. Endrenyi L. Kashuba A.D. Pharmacogenetics. 2000; 10: 373-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), which cannot be explained by genetic polymorphisms (9Lamba J.K. Lin Y.S. Thummel K. Daly A. Watkins P.B. Strom S.

Pharmacogenetics. 2003; 13: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The CYP3A4 expression is largely regulated at the transcriptional level by transcriptional factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, and hepatocyte nuclear factors, HNF4α and HNF3γ, as well as constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and PXR (11Martínez-Jiménez C.P.

However, the cause of the large interindividual variability in CYP3A4 level is poorly understood and is an urgent issue to be solved. The regulation by PXR may, in part, be responsible for such variability, since PXR is activated by endogenous compounds, such as steroid hormones and bile acids (1Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 12Kretschmer X.C. Baldwin W.S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2005; 155: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). PXR regulates many targets controlling pharmacokinetics, but its own regulation is not fully understood, with reports showing only that human PXR is induced by dexamethasone through glucocorticoid receptor (13Pascussi J.M. Drocourt L. Fabre J.M. Maurel P. Vilarem M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) or by clofibrate through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (14Aouabdi S. Gibson G. Plant N. Drug Metab.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web), we found some potential recognition sites for micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the human PXR. miRNAs are a recently discovered family of short noncoding RNA whose final product is an ∼22-nucleotide functional RNA molecule (16Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29863) Google Scholar). They play important roles in the regulation of target genes by binding to complementary regions of transcripts to repress their translation or regulate degradation. At present, more than 400 miRNAs have been identified in humans, and miRNAs are predicted to control about 30% of the genes within the human genome (17Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Real Time RT-PCR for PXR and CYP3A4—Total RNA was isolated from 25 human liver samples using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The forward and reverse primers for CYP3A4 were 5′-CCAAGCTATGCTCTTCACCG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCTCCACTTACGGTGC-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers for human PXR were 5′-TGCGAGATCACCCGGAAGAC-3′ and 5′-ATGGGAGAAGGTAGTGTCAAAGG-3′, respectively.

After an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, the amplification was performed by denaturation at 95 °C for 6 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 20 s for 40 cycles. The mRNA levels were normalized with GAPDH mRNA determined by real time RT-PCR, as described previously (19Tsuchiya Y. Nakajima M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Inoue M. Yokoi T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3119-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses of PXR and CYP3A4—Whole cell lysates were prepared from 25 human liver samples by homogenization with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The protein concentrations were determined using Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with γ-globulin as a standard. The whole cell lysates (10–50 μg) were separated with 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA).

Nuclear extracts (10 μg) from the HepG2 and LS-180 cells were also used to determine the PXR protein level. Real Time RT-PCR for Mature miR-148a—For the quantification of mature miR-148a, polyadenylation and reverse transcription were performed using the NCode miRNA first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The forward primer for miR-148a was 5′-TCAGTGCACTACAGAACTTTGT-3′, and the reverse primer was the supplemented universal qPCR primer. The PCR analyses were performed as follows.

Construction of Reporter Plasmids—To construct luciferase reporter plasmids, various target fragments were inserted into the XbaI site downstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3-promoter vector. The sequence from 3362 to 3383 in the human PXR mRNA (5′-ACAGACTCTTACGTGGAGAGTGCACTGA-3′) was termed the miR-148a recognition element (PXRMRE148). The fragment containing three copies of the PXRMRE148 (5′-CTAGAAGCCACAGACTCTTACGTGGAGAGTGCACTGACCTGTAGAAGCCACAGACTCTTACGTGGAGAGTGCACTGACCTGTAGAAGCCACAGACTCTTACGTGGAGAGTGCACTGACCTGTAT-3′; PXRMRE148 is underlined) was cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector (pGL3p/3×PXRMRE). The complementary sequence of three copies of the PXRMRE148 was also cloned into the pGL3-promoter plasmid (pGL3p/3×PXRMRE-Rev). A fragment containing the perfect matching sequence with the mature miR-148a, 5′-CTAGACAAAGTTCTGTAGTGCACTGAT-3′ (the matching sequence of miR-148a is underlined) was cloned into the pGL3-promoter vector (pGL3p/c-148a). The nucleotide sequences of the constructed plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing analyses. Luciferase Assay—Various luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL3p) were transiently transfected with pGL4.74-TK plasmid into HEK293 or HepG2 cells. Briefly, the day before transfection, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates. After 24 h, 70 ng of pGL3p plasmid, 30 ng of pGL4.74-TK plasmid, and 4 pmol of the precursors for miR-148a or control were transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. For HepG2 cells, 80 ng of pGL3p plasmid, 20 ng of pGL4.74-TK plasmid, and 10 pmol of the AsOs for miR-148a or control were transfected using Tfx-20 reagent. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were resuspended in passive lysis buffer, and then the luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Wallac, Turku, Finland), using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Transfection of Precursor or Antisense for miR-148a into HepG2 and LS-180 Cells and Isolation of Nuclear Extract and Total RNA—To investigate the effect of miR-148a on the expression of PXR protein, 50 nm precursor or 50 nm AsO for miR-148a or control was transfected into HepG2 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. After 72 h, total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN, and the mature miR-148a levels were determined by Northern blotting as described above. Nuclear extract was isolated using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LS180 cells were transfected with 50 nm precursor for miR-148a or control using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 50 μm rifampicin or 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO for 24 h. Then total RNA and nuclear extract were isolated. Evaluation of the Expression Level of PXR in HepG2 Using Reporter Construct Containing PXR-responsive Element—The reporter construct pCYP3A4-362-7.7K contains the promoter region (–362 to +11), including the ER6 (everted repeat separated by six nucleotides) motif and the distal enhancer region (–7836 to –7200), including the DR3 (direct repeat separated by three nucleotides) motif of the CYP3A4 gene, to which PXR binds (21Takada T. Ogino M. Miyata M. Shimada M. Nagata K. Yamazoe Y. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 2004; 19: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The day before transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. After 24 h, 180 ng of pCYP3A4-362-7.7K, 20 ng of pGL4.74-TK plasmid, and various doses of the precursors and AsOs for miR-148a or control were transfected using Tfx-20 reagent. After incubation for 48 h, the cells were treated with 10 μm rifampicin or 0.1% Me2SO for 24 h, and then the luciferase activity was measured. Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test or Tukey's method test. Comparison of two groups was made with an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Correlation analyses were performed by Spearman's rank method. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PXR Protein Level Is Not Associated with PXR mRNA Level in Human Livers—We first examined the PXR mRNA level in a panel of 25 human livers by real time RT-PCR assay and investigated the relationship with the PXR protein level. As shown in Fig. 1, no statistically significant correlation was observed between the PXR mRNA and protein levels (Rs = 0.10), indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation of human PXR. To uncover the molecular mechanism of the post-transcriptional regulation, we sought to examine the involvement of miRNA-mediated regulation. Employing an on-line search using the miRBase Target data base (15Griffiths-Jones S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web), potential recognition elements for 16 kinds of miRNA, such as miR-148a, miR-192, and miR-560, were found in the 3′-UTR in human PXR. Among them, we focused on miR-148a because it is selectively and abundantly expressed in liver (22Barad O. Meiri E. Avniel A. Aharonov R. Barzilai A. Bentwich I. Einav U. Gilad S. Hurban P. Karov Y. Lobenhofer E.K. Sharon E. Shiboleth Y.M. Shtutman M. Bentwich Z. Einat P. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2486-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) and has high complementarity in the 5′-end at miRNA-mRNA duplexes, including the seed sequence. The potential miR-148a target site is ∼200 bases downstream of the stop codon of the human PXR mRNA. The alignment of hsa-miR-148a with the 3′-UTR of human PXR mRNA (Fig. 2A) was drawn using RNAhybrid (23Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). We investigated whether this region, termed the miR-148a recognition element (PXRMRE148), might be involved in the regulation of PXR by miR-148a.FIGURE 2Repressive regulation of human PXR by miR-148a. A, complementarity of miR-148a to the predicted target sequence of human PXR. The potential miR-148a recognition element (PXRMRE148) is located on +3359 to +3386 in the 3′-UTR of human PXR mRNA, where the numbering refers to the 5′-end of mRNA as 1. B, the mature miR-148a levels in HepG2, HuH7, HLE, Caco-2, Caco-2/D (differentiated), LS180, HEK293, and MCF-7 cells were determined by real time RT-PCR analysis using an NCode miRNA first strand cDNA synthesis kit. The values were the mature miR-148a levels normalized with the U6 snRNA levels relative to that in HLE cells. C and D, luciferase assays were performed to investigate whether PXRMRE148 is functional in the regulation by miR-148a. The reporter constructs were transiently transfected with 4 pmol of the precursors for miR-148a or control into HEK293 cells (C) or 10 pmol of the AsO for miR-148a or control into HepG2 cells (D). The data were the firefly luciferase activities normalized with the Renilla luciferase activities relative to that of pGL3p plasmid.

The mature miR-148a was detected in all cell lines tested in this study, with large variability among cell lines (37-fold). The U6 snRNA levels, which were used for normalization, varied <3-fold in the experiment, much less than the miR-148a levels. The mature miR-148a was higher in HepG2 and differentiated Caco-2 cells than the other cell lines. It was also interesting that, in Caco-2 cells, the expression level of mature miR-148a was increased with differentiation. Thus, the expression levels of mature miR-148a were highly variable among the human cancer cell lines. Repressive Regulation of PXR by miR-148a in Human Cell Lines—To investigate whether PXRMRE148 is functional in the regulation by miR-148a, luciferase assays were performed with HEK293 cells (Fig. 2C). We first confirmed that the luciferase activity of the pGL3p/c-148a plasmid, in which the miR-148a complementary sequence was inserted downstream of the luciferase gene, was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased by the co-transfection with the precursor for miR-148a. The luciferase activity of pGL3p/3× PXRMRE plasmid, in which three copies of the potential miR-148a recognition site were inserted downstream of the luciferase gene, was also significantly (p < 0.01) decreased by co-transfection with the precursor for miR-148a (33% of control), whereas that of pGL3p/3× PXRMRE-Rev plasmid with the inverted recognition site was not affected. In HepG2 cells, which showed the highest expression of miR-148a (Fig. 2B), the luciferase activities of pGL3p/c-148a and pGL3p/3× PXRMRE plasmid were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than those of the control pGL3p plasmid (Fig. 2D). These activities were significantly (p < 0.01) restored by the transfection of AsO for miR-148a. These results underscore that miR-148a functionally recognizes PXRMRE148 to decrease the expression. Effects of Overexpression or Inhibition of miR-148a on the PXR Protein Level in a Human Cell Line—We next examined the change in endogenous PXR protein expression by the overexpression or inhibition of miR-148a. By the transfection of the precursor for miR-148a into HepG2 cells that harbor the increased level of mature miR-148a, the PXR protein level was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased compared with the control (Fig. 3A). Conversely, by the transfection of the AsO for miR-148a into HepG2 cells, where the expression of mature miR-148a was extinguished, the PXR protein level was significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared with the control (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, the expression level of RXRα protein, a heterodimer partner of PXR, was not affected by the overexpression or inhibition of miR-148a. It is well known that ligand-activated PXR activates the transcription of targets by binding to the responsive element. Using the pCYP3A4-362-7.7K plasmid containing the PXR-responsive element as a reporter construct, the changes in the PXR protein levels were monitored with the reporter activity (Fig. 3, C and D). The luciferase activity of pCYP3A4-362-7.7K plasmid was prominently (5.3-fold) increased by the treatment with rifampicin in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3E). Transfection of the precursor for miR-148a significantly decreased both the rifampicin-induced and basal transcriptional activities, resulting in a dose-dependent decrease of the induction. In contrast, the transfection of antisense for miR-148a significantly increased both the rifampicin-induced and basal transcriptional activity, resulting in a dose-dependent increase of the induction (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that miR-148a negatively regulates the expression of PXR protein and, subsequently, the induction of its targets. Role of miR-148a-dependent PXR Regulation in the Induction of Endogenous CYP3A4 mRNA in a Human Cell Line—We next sought to examine whether the miR-148a-dependent change of the PXR protein level affects the CYP3A4 induction in human cells. LS-180 cells were used, because this cell line expressed relatively higher CYP3A4 mRNA than the other cell lines (data not shown). By the transfection of the precursor for miR-148a into the LS-180 cells, the PXR protein level was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased (Fig. 4A), concomitant with a dramatic increase of the mature miR-148a level, whereas the PXR mRNA level was not decreased at any time after the transfection (Fig. 4B). The RXRα protein level was not affected by the overexpression of miR-148a (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4C, the CYP3A4 mRNA level was significantly increased by the treatment with rifampicin (5.0-fold). However, this induction was diminished by the overexpression of miR-148a, although the basal CYP3A4 mRNA level was not affected. These results suggest that the miR-148a-dependent regulation of PXR affects the induction of CYP3A4. The miR-148a-dependent PXR Regulation May Control CYP3A4 Expression in Human Liver Tissue—To further investigate the effects of the miR-148a-dependent regulation of PXR in human liver tissue, the relationships between the expression levels of miR-148a, PXR, and CYP3A4 were investigated using a panel of 25 human livers (supplemental Table 1). The expression levels of miR-148a were variable (95-fold) in the panel of human livers. The miR-148a level in liver sample 18 was comparable with that in HepG2 cells. The PXR mRNA (75-fold) and CYP3A4 mRNA (363-fold) were also variable. As shown in Fig. 1, the PXR mRNA level was not correlated with the PXR protein level. In contrast, the CYP3A4 mRNA level was significantly correlated (Rs = 0.67, p < 0.001) with the CYP3A4 protein level (Fig. 5A). When the PXR protein/PXR mRNA ratios were calculated as an index of the translational efficiency of PXR, they were inversely correlated with the miR-148a level (Rs =–0.41, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B), suggesting that PXR is negatively regulated by miR-148a in human liver. The PXR protein level was significantly correlated with both the CYP3A4 mRNA level (Rs = 0.47, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5C) and the CYP3A4 protein level (Rs = 0.67, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5D). As summarized in Fig. 5E, the post-transcriptional regulation of PXR by miR-148a appeared to have substantial impact on the CYP3A4 level in human livers. PXR regulates at least 40 genes encoding proteins responsible for the metabolism and elimination of drugs (14Aouabdi S. Gibson G. Plant N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The study of PXR regulation assists in the understanding of the inter- and intraindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Although many research groups have found variability in the PXR mRNA levels in human liver samples, the correlation with its protein level has not fully been investigated. In this study, we first demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between them in human livers. For human PXR, two splicing variants, including exon 1b (PXR.2) or deleting the 5′-end of the exon 5 (PXR.3), have been reported (24Bertilsson G. Heidrich J. Svensson K. Asman M. Jendeberg L. Sydow-Bäckman M. Ohlsson R. Postlind H. Blomquist P. Berkenstam A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12208-12213Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 25Dotzlaw H. Leygue E. Watson P. Murphy L.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2103-2107PubMed Google Scholar), which cannot be distinguished with our PCR primers. However, since the expression levels of these splicing variants were extremely low in our analysis (data not shown), consistent with a report by Lamba et al. (26Lamba V. Yasuda K. Lamba J.K. Assem M. Davila J. Strom S. Schuetz E.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2004; 199: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the dissociation of the PXR protein level with its mRNA level is not an artificial phenomenon. Identification of the miRNA recognition element in the human PXR gene suggested the involvement of miRNA in the regulation of PXR. The luciferase assays showed that the endogenous and exogenous miR-148a negatively regulated the activity through PXRMRE148. In addition, the endogenous PXR protein level was diminished by the overexpression of miR-148a and elevated by its inhibition. These results clearly indicated that human PXR is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-148a. The miR-148a-dependent changes of PXR protein affected the induction of CYP3A4 in LS180 cells. To further investigate whether the miR-148a affects the induction of other targets of PXR, we determined the expression levels of MDR1 and CYP2B6 in LS180 cells (data not shown). Rifampicin induced the MDR1 (5-fold) and CYP2B6 (2-fold) mRNAs, known targets of PXR (27Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 28Goodwin B. Moore L.B. Stoltz C.M. McKee D.D. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 427-431PubMed Google Scholar), and the induction was attenuated by the overexpression of miR-148a. Thus, the miR-148a-dependent regulation of PXR appeared to affect its target genes in common. Interestingly, the miR-148a recognition element is also present in the 3′-UTR of CYP3A4 mRNA. The complementarity of CYP3A4 with miR-148 (score 15.48, energy –24.27) was higher than that of human PXR (score 15.14, energy –19.52). To investigate whether CYP3A4 is directly regulated by miR-148a, luciferase assays were performed using a plasmid containing three copies of the miR-148a recognition element in the CYP3A4 gene. However, unlike the PXRMRE, the element in CYP3A4 did not respond to miR-148a (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that CYP3A4 is not directly regulated by miR-148a. In the panel of human livers, the expression level of miR-148a was inversely correlated with the translational efficiency of PXR, supporting the role of miR-148a in the regulation of PXR in liver. The significant correlation between the CYP3A4 mRNA and the CYP3A4 protein level in human livers in this study, in accordance with previous studies (29Westlind-Johnsson A. Malmebo S. Johansson A. Otter C. Andersson T.B. Johansson I. Edwards R.J. Boobis A.R. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe M. Kumai T. Matsumoto N. Tanaka M. Suzuki S. Satoh T. Kobayashi S. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 94: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), supported the finding that miRNA did not directly regulate the CYP3A4 expression. The PXR protein level was correlated with the CYP3A4 mRNA level in human liver, indicating that miR-148a affects the CYP3A4 expression through modulating PXR expression. The PXR protein level was not correlated with the CYP2B6 (Rs = 0.31, p > 0.1) or MDR1 (Rs =–0.20, p > 0.3) mRNA levels in the panel of human livers (data not shown), in contrast to CYP3A4. Thus, we speculate that the PXR does not largely affect the constitutive expression of CYP2B6 and MDR1 in the liver. In our panel of human livers, the CYP3A4 mRNA level was not correlated with the HNF4α protein level (Rs = –0.14, p > 0.5) or CAR protein level (Rs = 0.12, p > 0.5), indicating a significant contribution of PXR to the constitutive CYP3A4 level. Most of the genes in the vertebrate nuclear receptor super-family are strongly conserved between species. The ligand-binding domain of PXR shares amino acid identity of 75% between human and rodent, which can explain why the key ligands for PXR vary across species. Meanwhile, the DNA-binding domain of PXR shares more than 95% amino acid identity (1Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Willson T.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 687-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), inducing a similar set of genes. Most miRNAs are evolutionally conserved, which suggests that the miRNA-mediated regulation of certain genes would be common among species. The MRE148 is also identified in the 3′-UTR in mouse PXR (score 16.63, energy –21.4) and rat PXR (score and energy are not calculated at miRBase, but it has only a 1-base difference from the corresponding mouse sequence) at ∼670 bp downstream of the stop codon, although the 3′-UTR of PXR is poorly conserved between humans and rodents. It is therefore possible that rodent PXR may also be regulated by miR-148a, suggesting that rodents might be useful model animals to investigate the role of miR-148a in drug metabolism and elimination in vivo. In conclusion, we found that human PXR is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-148a affecting the CYP3A4 level in human liver. This study would provide new insight into the unsolved mechanism of the large interindividual variability of CYP3A4 expression. We are grateful to Drs.

Here we report that Lis1 is essential for precise control of mitotic spindle orientation in both neuroepithelial stem cells and radial glial progenitor cells. Controlled gene deletion of Lis1 in vivo in neuroepithelial stem cells, where cleavage is uniformly vertical and symmetrical, provokes rapid apoptosis of those cells, while radial glial progenitors are less affected. Impaired cortical microtubule capture via loss of cortical dynein causes astral and cortical microtubules to be greatly reduced in Lis1-deficient cells. Increased expression of the LIS/dynein binding partner NDEL1 restores cortical microtubule and dynein localization in Lis1-deficient cells.

The neural tube at embryonic day 8–8.5 (E8–8.5) in the mouse consists of a single pseudostratified epithelial layer of neuroepithelial stem cells (NESC) that undergo rapid symmetrical proliferative divisions as the neural tube grows and the progenitor pool is expanded. Neurogenesis begins at about E12 as the NESCs first undergo asymmetric divisions to generate one radial glial progenitor cell (RGPC) and one migratory postmitotic daughter neuron. The neocortex partitions into the proliferative ventricular zone (VZ), intermediate zone (IZ), cortical plate (CP), and marginal zone (MZ). Several embryonic lamina are established between E13 and E19 in the mouse in an “inside-out” pattern as neurons generated from the RGPCs in the VZ migrate through the IZ toward the CP. Similar events occur during the development of other areas of the brain such as the midbrain and hindbrain (reviewed in Gupta et al., 2002Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Life is a journey: a genetic look at neocortical development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The maintenance of proliferative NESCs and their transition to RGPC at the onset of neurogenesis is fundamental to the formation of the brain (reviewed in Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). NESCs and RGPCs span the neural tube and/or brain, attached at the apical (ventricular) and basal (pial) surfaces. Both types of progenitors display interkinetic nuclear migration (Takahashi et al., 1993Takahashi T. Nowakowski R.S. Caviness Jr., V.S.

Cortex. 2003; 13: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nuclei migrate from apical to basal surfaces in NESCs, while interkinetic nuclear migration in RGPCs is restricted to the VZ. Both types of progenitors display apical-basal polarity, with apical localization of the centrosome, PAR3, PAR6/atypical PKC (aPKC), and junctional proteins (reviewed in Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). NESCs are generated from symmetrical proliferative divisions perpendicular to the apical-basal axis in the single layer of the neuroepithelium (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K.

In the RGPCs that act as neuronal progenitors during neurogenesis as well as radial guides for migration of daughter postmitotic cells (Noctor et al., 2001Noctor S.C. Flint A.C. Weissman T.A.

Symmetrical divisions in NESCs likely result in the symmetrical distribution of polarized apical components, while asymmetric divisions in RGPCs distribute components asymmetrically to produce one progenitor and one neuron or glial cell (reviewed in Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M.

Importantly, no genetic mutants disrupting symmetrical divisions in NESCs or distinguishing mechanisms of symmetric from asymmetric divisions have yet been identified. Here, in the course of studying its in vivo role, we identify Lis1 (also known as Pafah1b1) as a critical component in NESCs. Heterozygous loss or mutation of LIS1 is sufficient to cause the human neuronal migration defect lissencephaly (“smooth brain”), characterized by a smooth cortical surface, abnormal cortical layering, and enlarged ventricles (reviewed in Gupta et al., 2002Gupta A.

We produced an allelic series of mice with varying doses of Lis1 generated from different combinations of two mutant alleles of Lis1 in mice (see Figure S1), a null knockout (Lis1ko) and a conditional knockout/hypomorphic allele (Lis1hc), and demonstrated in vivo Lis1-dosage-dependent neuronal migration defects (Hirotsune et al., 1998Hirotsune S.

Lis1+/ko and Lis1hc/ko mice exhibited defects in neurogenesis and interkinetic nuclear migration at the ventricular zone of the cortex, implicating LIS1 in neurogenesis (Gambello et al., 2003Gambello M.J.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LIS1 overexpression or disruption by antibody injection in cell culture supports a role for LIS1 in a variety of dynein-dependent mitotic functions (Faulkner et al., 2000Faulkner N.E. Dujardin D.L. Tai C.Y. Vaughan K.T. O'Connell C.B. Wang Y. Vallee R.B. A role for the lissencephaly gene LIS1 in mitosis and cytoplasmic dynein function.Nat.

Role of dynein, dynactin, and CLIP-170 interactions in LIS1 kinetochore function.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Finally, siRNA knockdown of Lis1 in rat cortical slice cultures resulted in defects in migration, interkinetic nuclear migration, and ventricular zone/intermediate zone defects in cell division (Tsai et al., 2005Tsai J.W. Chen Y. Kriegstein A.R. Vallee R.B. LIS1 RNA interference blocks neural stem cell division, morphogenesis, and motility at multiple stages.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These and other studies suggest an important role for LIS1 in cell division and neurogenesis, but its precise role is not well defined. We directly demonstrate an essential and surprising role for Lis1 in the neuroepithelium at times prior to the onset of radial glial neurogenesis and neuronal migration as well as in mitotic spindle orientation and symmetric division at the apical surface of cells. This effect appears to result from a requirement for LIS1 in dynein-mediated cortical microtubule capture. This novel function for LIS1 during mitosis and neurogenesis reveals a unique and critical role for the control of vertical spindle orientation and symmetric cleavage during neuroepithelial expansion of NESCs and supports the established role of spindle orientation in RGPC neurogenesis. To examine the role of Lis1 during progenitor expansion and neurogenesis, we ablated Lis1 in restricted spatial and/or temporal patterns in the developing brain using a Lis1 conditional-hypomorphic knockout allele and compared the phenotype of littermates heterozygous or homozygous for Lis1hc with various Cre transgenes (Figure S1). The Rosa26-lacZ Cre reporter (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) marked Cre-exposed cells. Pax2-Cre transgenic mice express Cre predominantly at the midbrain-hindbrain junction starting at E8.0 in the neuroepithelium prior to the onset of neuronal migration (Lewis et al., 2004Lewis P.M. Gritli-Linde A. Smeyne R. Kottmann A. McMahon A.P. Sonic hedgehog signaling is required for expansion of granule neuron precursors and patterning of the mouse cerebellum.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 393-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Lis1hc/hc; Pax2-Cre; Rosa26 pups did not survive past P0. Strikingly, the midbrain, midbrain-hindbrain junction, and the cerebellum were absent in nearly all (n = 10) Lis1hc/hc; Pax2-Cre; Rosa26 mice, resulting in the separation of the forebrain from the hindbrain at birth (data not shown). In whole embryos at E9.5, there was a small but noticeable reduction in X-gal staining in the branchial arches (Figures 1A, 1B, 1E, and 1F, arrows) and the midbrain-hindbrain region (Figures 1A, 1B, 1E, and 1F; arrowheads) of Lis1hc/hc; Pax2-Cre; Rosa26 compared with Lis1+/hc; Pax2-Cre; Rosa26 embryos. The majority of the X-gal positive cells in the midbrain-hindbrain but not the X-gal negative cells in the telencephalon, underwent apoptotic cell death in the Lis1hc/hc; Pax2-Cre; Rosa26 embryos (Figures 1G and 1H), whereas control embryos displayed negligible numbers of apoptotic cells (Figures 1C and 1D). Wnt1-Cre (Chai et al., 2000Chai Y. Jiang X. Ito Y. Bringas Jr., P. Han J. Rowitch D.H. Soriano P. McMahon A.P. Sucov H.M. Fate of the mammalian cranial neural crest during tooth and mandibular morphogenesis.Development. 2000; 127: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is expressed at the midbrain-hindbrain junction and in the telencephalon at about E8–8.5 (see Figures 1I and 1J). The broader expression pattern of Wnt1-Cre resulted in severe neuronal loss in the telencephalon as well as in the midbrain-hindbrain junction of Lis1hc/hc; Wnt1-Cre; Rosa26 embryos and death at about E13.5. At E10.5, the telencephalon of Lis1hc/hc; Wnt1-Cre; Rosa26 embryos was significantly smaller and degenerated compared to control (compare Figures 1I and 1J with 1M and 1N), and degeneration of the telencephalon and midbrain was observed at E11.5 (compare Figures 1K and 1L with 1O and 1P). These acute phenotypes were observed in neuronal progenitor cells in the neuroepithelium prior to the onset of RGPC neurogenesis and neuronal migration, demonstrating that LIS1 is essential during neuroepithelial expansion of NESCs in the midbrain-hindbrain junction as well as the telencephalon. To determine whether LIS1 plays an important role during RGPC neurogenesis as well as NESC expansion in the neuroepithelium, we used the hGFAP-Cre transgenic mouse to inactivate Lis1 (Zhuo et al., 2001Zhuo L. Theis M. Alvarez-Maya I. Brenner M. Willecke K. Messing A. hGFAP-cre transgenic mice for manipulation of glial and neuronal function in vivo.Genesis. 2001; 31: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). hGFAP-Cre expression begins at E12.5–13.5 in distinct developmental stages in neuronal precursor cells of the neocortex and hippocampus (Malatesta et al., 2003Malatesta P. Hack M.A. Hartfuss E. Kettenmann H. Klinkert W. Kirchhoff F. Gotz M. Neuronal or glial progeny: regional differences in radial glia fate.Neuron. 2003; 37: 751-764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). hGFAP-Cre is active in the RGPCs of virtually all radially migrating cells in the neocortex, but not in the neocortical neuroepithelium prior to E12.5. By contrast, hGFAP-Cre is expressed in the neuroepithelium in the hippocampal region at E12.5, a time when only immature mitotic NESCs are present. If Lis1 is critical in NESCs and RGPC, then the phenotype should be similarly severe in both the hippocampus and cortex, but if Lis1 is more important in NESCs than RGPCs, then the phenotype should be more severe in the hippocampus than the cortex. In wild-type Lis1+/+; hGFAP-Cre; Rosa26 (Figures 1Q–1T) neonates, the cortex and hippocampus were well developed. Lis1hc/hc; hGFAP-Cre; Rosa26 neonates survived to P5, but were completely missing the hippocampus (Figures 1U–1X, see arrows in Figure 1V and 1W). The cortex of these neonates was present, although thinner than control animals. Nearly all cells present in the cortex had some blue staining, indicating that Cre was present in these cells (data not shown). A few apoptotic cells were observed in the cortex of Lis1hc/hc; hGFAP-Cre; Rosa26 embryos (data not shown) in contrast to the massive and acute apoptosis observed when Lis1 was deleted during NESC expansion. These studies demonstrate an immediate and essential role for Lis1 in dividing neural progenitor cells of the neuroepithelium, while the loss of Lis1 in radial glial progenitors undergoing neurogenesis and neuronal migration have less immediate consequences for survival. To identify factors that differentiate NESCs and RGPCs (reviewed in Gotz and Huttner, 2005Gotz M. Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar), we determined whether LIS1 affects apical-basal polarity and/or mitotic spindle orientation during neuroepithelial expansion and/or radial glial neurogenesis. Apical determinants such as centrosomes (marked by pericentrin), β-catenin, aPKC, Numb, and the cadherin hole (Kosodo et al., 2004Kosodo Y. Roper K. Haubensak W. Marzesco A.M. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Asymmetric distribution of the apical plasma membrane during neurogenic divisions of mammalian neuroepithelial cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2314-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) were apically located in wild-type or Lis1+/ko or Lis1hc/ko mutant embryos with 50% or 35% of wild-type LIS1 protein, respectively (see Gambello et al., 2003Gambello M.J. Darling D.L. Yingling J. Tanaka T. Gleeson J.G. Wynshaw-Boris A. Multiple dose-dependent effects of Lis1 on cerebral cortical development.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the neuroepithelium (E9.5; Figures 2A, 2B, S2, and S3) and radial glia (E14.5; Figures 2C, 2D, S2, and S3), although not as tightly localized to the apical surface of mutant embryos in a Lis1 dosage-dependent fashion. This may be due to the less-organized cellular structure from long-term deficiencies of LIS1 as indicated by nestin (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2). Of note, the cadherin hole was present at the apical surface of wild-type and all mutant embryos (Figures 2A–2D, S2, and S3) consistent with the maintenance of apical polarity. Nuclei undergoing interkinetic nuclear migration are elongated and distributed throughout the apical-basal axis, as seen in wild-types (Figures 2A and 2C), but in Lis1 mutants, the nuclei were round and accumulated near the apical surface (Figures 2B and 2D), consistent with previously described interkinetic nuclear migration defects (Gambello et al., 2003Gambello M.J. Darling D.L. Yingling J. Tanaka T. Gleeson J.G. Wynshaw-Boris A. Multiple dose-dependent effects of Lis1 on cerebral cortical development.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2004Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Symmetrical apical mitotic cell divisions display vertically oriented cleavage planes (90° relative to the plane of the apical surface) to generate two proliferative daughter progenitor cells attached at the apical and basal surfaces, while asymmetric divisions generate one proliferative daughter cell and a postmitotic neuron or glial cell. At E9.5, all wild-type anaphase neuroepithelial cells in the neural tube displayed nearly vertical (symmetric) cleavage (Figures 2A and 2I; average angle: 80.72° ± 9.56°), while the majority of anaphase cells in wild-type cortical slices at radial glial stages (E14.5) displayed less perpendicular spindle cleavage planes with more variability (Figures 2C and 2I; average angle: 70.15° ± 18.3°, p < 0.016). In neural tubes at E9.5 and in cortex at E14.5 from Lis1+/ko or Lis1hc/hc embryos, spindle cleavage planes were more randomized and more horizontal to the ventricular surface than WT, with the degree of randomization proportional to the reduction of LIS1 (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2I). This suggests that disruption of the orientation of apical spindle cleavage planes seen with reduction in LIS1 levels results in a severe and catastrophic disruption in the neuroepithelium during NESC expansion when cleavage plane is tightly controlled. During radial glial neurogenesis, spindle orientation defects result in a change of progenitor cell fate, reducing the progenitor pool population early in cortical development and decreasing the total number of cortical neurons. Consistent with this, there are reduced numbers of Tst-1-positive layer 2 cortical neurons (Figure 1X, arrow) and neurons marked with a series of layer specific markers (data not shown) in Lis1hc/hc; hGFAP-Cre; Rosa26 neonates. To delineate the temporal sequence of events that occurred after acute loss of Lis1, we used a tamoxifen-inducible Cre (Cre-ER™, Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: a tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar) and the Tg(ACTB-bgeo/DsRed.MST) Cre reporter (Vintersten et al., 2004Vintersten K. Monetti C. Gertsenstein M. Zhang P. Laszlo L. Biechele S. Nagy A. Mouse in red: red fluorescent protein expression in mouse ES cells, embryos, and adult animals.Genesis. 2004; 40: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which switches from beta-geo to DsRed.MST expression after Cre recombination. We injected pregnant dams with tamoxifen (2 mg/40 g mouse) to activate Cre at E8.5 and examined the phenotypes of Lis1hc/hc; Cre-ER™ experimental and Lis1hc/hc control embryos without Cre from the same litter 12, 24, and 36 hr later. Within 12 hr of Cre activation, vertical spindle orientation was disrupted (Figures 2E, 2F, and 2J). This immediate disruption of spindle orientation was associated with an increase in apoptosis (Figure 2K) and metaphase arrest with mitotic cells located away from the apical surface (phospho-H3 histone, Figure 2L), without disruption of either apical polarity or epithelial integrity (Figures 2E, 2F, S2, and S4). At later time points, 24 and 36 hr after Cre activation, the spindle, apoptosis, and metaphase arrest phenotypes progressed further, with only minimal disruption of apical polarity and epithelial integrity (Figures 2G, 2H, 2J–2L S2, and S4). These findings indicate that the immediate effect of the loss of Lis1 is the disruption of the orientation of apical spindle cleavage planes and proliferation, resulting in a severe and catastrophic disruption in the neuroepithelium during NESC expansion when cleavage plane is tightly controlled. To examine cell-cycle progression and spindle organization in vitro, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with decreasing doses of LIS1 were generated from mice with combinations of the Lis1ko and Lis1hc hypomorphic alleles (see Figure S1), including Lis1hc/hc; Cre-ER™ MEFs to analyze the effects of complete loss of LIS1. Lis1+/ko and Lis1hc/ko MEFs displayed 50% (data not shown), 35% of wild-type LIS1, while Lis1hc/hc; Cre-ER™ MEFs 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr after tamoxifen treatment (hereafter termed Lis124h, Lis148h and Lis172h) displayed 80%, 52%, 25%, and <10%, respectively, of wild-type levels by western blot (Figure 3A). The doubling time of Lis1hc/ko, Lis1+/ko and wild-type MEFs was 38, 26, and 18 hr, respectively (Figure 3B). There was a significant decrease in growth of Lis124h cells, a nearly normal increase Lis148h cells, and a plateau thereafter (Figure 3C). No effect of tamoxifen treatment on cell growth was seen with treatment of Lis1hc/hc MEFs without the Cre-ER™ transgene (data not shown). Cell death did not significantly increase in tamoxifen-treated versus untreated cells (data not shown). Mitotic index was 4.0% ± 0.14%, 3.6% ± 0.10%, 2.2% ± 0.12% for wild-type, Lis1+/ko, and Lis1hc/ko cells, respectively, while in Lis24h and Lis48h cells it was 13.1% ± 0.09% and 1.9 ± 0.08%. Doubling time and mitotic index were significantly different among groups (p < 0.05). There was a block in mitosis from a mitotic delay in prometaphase at 24 hr (10.0% ± 0.09% versus 4.0% ± 0.11% in control cells), which disappeared at 48 and 72 hr (Figure 3D, data not shown), similar to findings from LIS1 depletion experiments (Faulkner et al., 2000Faulkner N.E. Dujardin D.L. Tai C.Y. Vaughan K.T. O'Connell C.B. Wang Y. Vallee R.B. A role for the lissencephaly gene LIS1 in mitosis and cytoplasmic dynein function.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen-treated Cre-ER™; Lis1hc/hc MEFs underwent one cell division and then senesced or moved more slowly through all phases of the cell cycle, since there was little increase in prometaphase cells at 48 and 72 hr. MEFs with decreased LIS1 levels displayed severely shortened and sparse astral microtubules (MTs), using an EB1 antibody to label growing MT plus ends (Figures 3E–3G), an effect on either MT growth or stability proportional to the amount of LIS1. LIS1 reduction had no affect on the formation of bipolar spindles, spindle pole maintenance, or number (Figures 3H–3J). Prometaphase spindles of LIS1 mutant MEFs were smaller and slightly disorganized with fewer MTs (Figures 3I and 3J), and a few cells in anaphase and telophase were found. Metaphase spindles of Lis1hc/ko (Figure 3M), Lis124h, and Lis148h (data not shown) MEFs treated with MG-132 (to provoke metaphase arrest) looked similar to bipolar spindles of wild-type MEFs (Figure 3K) but were smaller (Figures 3Q and 3R). Wild-type and Lis1hc/ko MEFs were treated with MG-132 for 3 hr and then placed on ice for 1 hr to depolymerize unattached MTs. Lis1hc/ko MEFs did not display a significant decrease in stabilized spindle MTs (Figure 3N) compared with wild-type (Figure 3L). Lis148h spindles had less tightly aligned chromosomes compared with wild-type and other Lis1 mutants (Figures 3O–3R), suggesting impaired chromosome congression. No lagging chromosomes or chromosomal bridges during anaphase were found in wild-type (Figures 3S and 3T), but in Lis124h and Lis148h MEFs, many lagging chromosomes at anaphase were seen (10/24, Figures 3U and 3V) with a corresponding increase in micronuclei in the general population (72 hr, 51% ± 3.3% compared to wild-type 4.5% ± 1.2%, data not shown). Similar results were found in proliferation and mitosis in undifferentiated and proliferating neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from Lis1hc/hc; Cre-ER™; Rosa26 (Lis1hc/hc NPCs) mice after tamoxifen treatment to induce inactivation of Lis1 (Figure S5), but the scant cytoplasm of NPCs precluded examination o"

We identified reduced diacylglycerol kinase delta (DGKdelta) expression and DGK activity in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients. In diabetic animals, reduced DGKdelta protein and DGK kinase activity were restored upon correction of glycemia. DGKdelta haploinsufficiency increased diacylglycerol content, reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and glucose transport, and led to age-dependent obesity. Metabolic flexibility, evident by the transition between lipid and carbohydrate utilization during fasted and fed conditions, was impaired in DGKdelta haploinsufficient mice. We reveal a previously unrecognized role for DGKdelta in contributing to hyperglycemia-induced peripheral insulin resistance and thereby exacerbating the severity of type 2 diabetes. DGKdelta deficiency causes peripheral insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility. These defects in glucose and energy homeostasis contribute to mild obesity later in life."

To evaluate the effects of BPDE on human breast epithelial cells, we exposed an immortalized human breast cell line, MCF 10A, to BPDE and characterized the gene expression pattern. Of the differential genes expressed, we found consistent activation of DDX3, a member of the DEAD box RNA helicase family. Overexpression of DDX3 in MCF 10A cells induced an epithelial-mesenchymal-like transformation, exhibited increased motility and invasive properties, and formed colonies in soft-agar assays. Besides the altered phenotype, MCF 10A-DDX3 cells repressed E-cadherin expression as demonstrated by both immunoblots and by E-cadherin promoter-reporter assays. In addition, an in vivo association of DDX3 and the E-cadherin promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the activation of DDX3 by BPDE, can promote growth, proliferation and neoplastic transformation of breast epithelial cells."

This process is thought to involve X chromosome counting and choice. To explore how this process is initiated, we analyzed XCI in tetraploid XXXX, XXXY, and XXYY embryonic stem cells and found that every X chromosome within a single nucleus has an independent probability to initiate XCI. This finding suggests a stochastic mechanism directing XCI counting and choice. The probability is directly proportional to the X chromosome:ploidy ratio, indicating the presence of an X-encoded activator of XCI, that itself is inactivated by the XCI process. Deletion of a region including Xist, Tsix, and Xite still results in XCI on the remaining wild-type X chromosome in female cells. This result supports a stochastic model in which each X chromosome in a nucleus initiates XCI independently and positions an X-encoded trans-acting XCI-activator outside the deleted region.

This result supports a stochastic model in which each X chromosome in a nucleus initiates XCI independently and positions an X-encoded trans-acting XCI-activator outside the deleted region. In placental mammals, gene dosage of X chromosomal genes is equalized between sexes by inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female cells (Lyon, 1961Lyon M.F. Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (Mus musculus L.).Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). In mouse and human embryos, XCI is initiated early in development and is random with respect to the parental origin of the X chromosome. Three X-linked noncoding genes, Xist, Tsix, and Xite, located within the X inactivation center (Xic), play a crucial role in the XCI process (Lee and Lu, 1999Lee J.T. Lu N.

Requirement for Xist in X chromosome inactivation.Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). At the start of XCI, the cell determines the number of X chromosomes and elects the future inactive and active X chromosomes. Next, Xist RNA accumulates in cis on the future inactive X chromosome (Xi), followed by several epigenetic changes that “lock in” and maintain the inactive state through many cell divisions (Brockdorff et al., 1992Brockdorff N. Ashworth A. Kay G.F. McCabe V.M. Norris D.P. Cooper P.J. Swift S. Rastan S.

Tsix and Xite play an essential role in downregulation of Xist RNA before and during the XCI process. Despite the progress made over the last decades in understanding XCI, the mechanism underlying the counting and choice process remains unclear. X:autosome translocations suggested the presence of a blocking factor that protects one X chromosome from inactivation per diploid nucleus (Rastan, 1983Rastan S. Non-random X-chromosome inactivation in mouse X-autosome translocation embryos–location of the inactivation centre.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1983; 78: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar). Different deletions 3′ of the Xist gene resulted in XCI in male cells thus suggesting the location of the blocking factor binding site (Clerc and Avner, 1998Clerc P. Avner P.

Other elements are also involved in the counting and choice process. For example, in female cells with a heterozygous Xist mutation (that abolishes Xist function), the mutant allele is never chosen to be inactivated (Gribnau et al., 2005Gribnau J. Luikenhuis S.

In agreement with this, heterozygous mutations that abolish Tsix transcription result in preferential inactivation of the mutant X chromosome (Clerc and Avner, 1998Clerc P. Avner P.

To explain the finding that initiation of XCI is absent in male cells with a Tsix promoter mutation, an X-linked competence factor was introduced (two copies are required for initiation of XCI) (Lee and Lu, 1999Lee J.T. Lu N. Targeted mutagenesis of Tsix leads to nonrandom X inactivation.Cell. 1999; 99: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a homozygous mutation of the Tsix promoter revealed a “chaotic” choice mechanism, in which zero, one, or two X chromosomes were chosen for inactivation (Lee, 2005Lee J.T. Regulation of X-chromosome counting by Tsix and Xite sequences.Science. 2005; 309: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, only cells with a single Xi were capable of contributing to a developing embryo (Lee, 2002Lee J.T. Homozygous Tsix mutant mice reveal a sex-ratio distortion and revert to random X-inactivation.Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Besides a blocking factor model, other models have been put forward to explain XCI counting and choice. One model predicts that the fate of an X chromosome is determined prior to the start of the XCI process and is based on differences in sister chromatid cohesion in female ES cells (Mlynarczyk-Evans et al., 2006Mlynarczyk-Evans S. Royce-Tolland M. Alexander M.K. Andersen A.A. Kalantry S. Gribnau J. Panning B.

A different model explains counting and choice through transient cross communication between X chromosomes (Marahrens, 1999Marahrens Y. X-inactivation by chromosomal pairing events.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2624-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is supported by two studies showing that the X chromosomes in female cells transiently move closer during the initiation phase of XCI in a subset of cells (Bacher et al., 2006Bacher C.P. Guggiari M. Brors B. Augui S. Clerc P. Avner P. Eils R. Heard E. Transient colocalization of X-inactivation centres accompanies the initiation of X inactivation.Nat.

Transient homologous chromosome pairing marks the onset of X inactivation.Science. 2006; 311: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear how this model can explain observations made in diploid XXXX and tetraploid XXXX cells, that inactivate three and two X chromosomes respectively, and the XX 65 kb deletion line that does not show a counting defect despite the absence of transvection (Brown et al., 1992Brown C.J.

Stochastic model systems have been postulated to explain a variety of cellular choice processes, including lineage specification in the hematopoietic system (Till et al., 1964Till J.E. McCulloch E.A.

Stochastic spineless expression creates the retinal mosaic for colour vision.Nature. 2006; 440: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Here, we propose a stochastic model for XCI, in which each X chromosome has a probability to be inactivated within a certain time span. To validate such a model, we have analyzed XCI in differentiating diploid and tetraploid ES cells, the latter providing a much wider spectrum of possible outcomes of the XCI process. In addition, we have analyzed XCI in female ES cells with a deletion encompassing all elements that have previously been shown to be involved in XCI counting, including Xist, Tsix, and Xite. Our results support a stochastic model for XCI counting and choice, and indicate the presence of a novel X-encoded factor, XCI-activator, involved in initiation of XCI. In differentiating diploid female ES cell cultures, we observed a reproducible proportion of cells with two Xist RNA FISH clouds in one nucleus (Figure 1A). In ICM-derived cells that were allowed to differentiate in vitro (Figure 1B), we also noticed female cells with two Xist clouds. These observations suggest that some of the female cells attempt to inactivate both X chromosomes. Three independent EB differentiation experiments with female ES cells showed that the relative number of cells with two Xist clouds, as determined by RNA FISH, is low but consistent throughout differentiation. The proportion of these double-cloud cells seemed to increase up to day 5 of differentiation and then decreased subsequently (Figure 1C). The presence of cells with two Xist clouds could be attributed to leakiness of the XCI mechanism, resulting in inactivation of the future Xa, and would predict the presence of a comparable percentage of Xist clouds in male cells during ES cell differentiation. Analysis of three different male cell lines showed almost no cells initiating XCI on their single X chromosome, indicating that the presence of the female cells with two Xi-s cannot be explained by sporadic leakiness of the XCI mechanism (Figure 1D). To exclude the possibility that cells with two Xist clouds were aneuploid, we performed RNA/DNA FISH on day 3, 5, and 7 EB differentiated cells, and in vitro differentiated ICM cells. The ploidy status of cells with two Xist clouds was confirmed to be diploid (Figures 1E and 1F). Thus, cells with two Xist RNA clouds are present in early differentiating ES and ICM cell populations. To investigate this observation in more detail, we generated tetraploid ES cell lines. Different combinations of neomycin- and puromycin-resistant female and male diploid F1 hybrid ES cell lines were fused to generate tetraploid XXXX, XXXY, and XXYY cell lines (Figure 2A). Clones were grown under continuous double selection. Withdrawal of double selection or the use of inbred ES cells resulted in accelerated chromosome loss. FACS analysis of different tetraploid ES cell lines showed a doubling in DNA content compared to diploid XX ES cells and male mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, Figure 2B). The 2n peak in our tetraploid samples decreased after 1 hr of preplating on nongelatinized dishes, indicating that this peak represents male MEFs used for culturing our ES cells. DNA FISH analysis using different autosomal and sex-chromosomal probes confirmed tetraploidy of the cell lines (Figures 2C and 2D). In addition, extensive karyotyping of two XXXX (8 and 10) lines and two XXXY (5 and 11) lines showed that the chromosome number in all the lines was around 80 chromosomes, with the majority of cells retaining 80 chromosomes (Figures 2E–2G). With DNA FISH analysis using an X paint probe, we found that around 94% of the XXXX cells retain four X chromosomes, and more than 94% of the XXXY cells retain three X chromosomes (Figures 2E–2G). We did not find XXXX cells with more than four X chromosomes or XXXY cells with more than three X chromosomes. To test whether tetraploid ES cells have a stable karyotype throughout embryoid body (EB) differentiation, we repeated the FACS analysis and karyotyping with day 5 EB differentiated cells from two different XXXX and XXXY ES cell lines. We found that our ES cells maintain a stable karyotype throughout the differentiation process (Figures 2H and 2I). More importantly, X-paint DNA FISH analysis indicated that a small gain in chromosome number could not be attributed to an increase in the number of X chromosomes. Taken together, these results show that the generated tetraploid ES cell lines have a stable karyotype throughout EB differentiation. To study the XCI process in different XXXX, XXXY, and XXYY tetraploid ES cell lines, we differentiated and fixed the cells at day 3, 5, 7, and 10 of differentiation. Interestingly, RNA FISH analysis with an Xist probe on XXXX ES cells indicated the presence of cells with zero to four Xi-s (Figure 3A). The populations of cells with different numbers of Xi-s during EB differentiation changed over time (Figure 3B). At day 3 of differentiation, most of the cells had no Xist cloud while fewer cells had one, two, and three clouds. Later in differentiation (day 5, 7, and 10), cells with two clouds represented the largest population, and this increased over time. Other populations with no, one, or three clouds declined over time. In addition to the karyotyping (Figure 2I), we performed RNA/DNA FISH on XXXX line 8 at different time points during differentiation to further exclude the possibility that the analyzed cell lines were aneuploid. We first selected cells with 4 X chromosomes as judged by X chromosome paint signal (day 7 and day 10 samples) or an X chromosome-specific BAC signal (day 3 and day 5 samples) and subsequently counted the number of Xist RNA clouds in the nucleus (Figure 3C). We compared these results to the RNA FISH data obtained at different time points and confirmed the presence of cells with 3 and 4 Xist clouds (Figure 3D). We also found a relative increase in the percentage of cells with two clouds and a relative decrease in the percentage of cells with one cloud in day 5, 7, and 10 differentiated ES cells. These differences can be explained by the fact that RNA/DNA FISH analysis results in the exclusion of XXXO cells (Figure 2I) that show preferential inactivation of one X chromosome (see below). The distribution of cells over time suggests that cells with the correct Xa:ploidy ratio, are selected for during differentiation. Indeed, BrdU analysis of ES cells at day 7 of differentiation showed that BrdU positive cells with three and four Xi-s are severely reduced compared to the total population of cells, indicating that these cells stop dividing (Figures 3E and 3F). In contrast, the BrdU positive population consists almost entirely of cells with no, one or two Xi-s indicating that this part of the population remains proliferative (Figure 3F). The small number of BrdU positive cells with three Xi-s may indicate that these cells can still divide, albeit at a slower rate when compared to cells with two or less Xi-s, or perhaps more likely, they represent cells that were BrdU labeled prior to XCI. Interestingly, cells with none or one Xi disappeared during the differentiation process, suggesting that these cells initiate XCI on the remaining Xa-s. XXXY cells preferably inactivate one X chromosome (Figures 4A and 4B) Initiation of XCI was delayed as demonstrated by the percentage of cells with no clouds at day 3 of differentiation, as compared to day 3 differentiated XXXX ES cells (Figures 3B and 4B). RNA/DNA FISH on XXXY ES line 11, at different time points after differentiation, revealed a similar distribution when compared to RNA FISH alone (Figures 4C and 4D). BrdU incorporation analysis of cells at day 7 of differentiation showed that cells with more than one Xi stop dividing. Cells with no Xi are a large proportion of the BrdU positive cells, but disappear over time, again indicating that these cells are still initiating XCI (Figures 4E and 4F). XXYY cell lines only sporadically initiate XCI at day 3 and day 7 of differentiation similar to diploid XY cells (<0.3%, data not shown). The above experiments with tetraploid ES cells show that all cell lines preferably keep one Xa per diploid genome. Nevertheless, a significant number of cells do inactivate an aberrant number of X chromosomes during the XCI process. Cells with less than one Xa per diploid genome stop dividing, and are lost in time in the proliferating cell population. The existence of cells with an unexpected number of Xist clouds in differentiated ES cells led us to hypothesize that each X chromosome within a cell has a certain probability to initiate XCI. Indeed, for the XXXX cell lines the distribution of cells with different numbers of Xi-s (day 3 of differentiation) can be explained by assuming a 27% probability for each X chromosome to initiate XCI, after subtraction of cells without an Xist cloud (Figure 5A). We excluded this fraction because we cannot distinguish between the cell population that, has not yet initiated XCI and that which has initiated XCI but has not chosen an X chromosome for inactivation. Also, this population is not required to calculate the probability. Day 3 differentiated samples were used to avoid potential influences of cell selection or multiple rounds of inactivation in our calculation. Nonetheless, the calculated probability remains a cumulative probability over the first 3 days of differentiation. For the XXXY cells, a probability of 8% would generate a distribution that matches our experimental observation at day 3 of differentiation (Figure 5B). Based on these calculations, we conclude that the distribution of the different populations could be explained by assuming a probability for each X chromosome in a cell to initiate XCI. In addition, the probability increased with the X:ploidy ratio, indicating the presence of an X linked activator of XCI. Our results suggest an independent probability for each X chromosome to initiate XCI, followed by selection of cells with the correct number of Xa-s. Therefore, deletion of the cis acting genes (Xist, Tsix, and Xite) and all known elements involved in the counting process should have no effect on the probability to initiate inactivation on the remaining wild-type X chromosome in a diploid female cell. To test this hypothesis, we integrated a floxed hygroTK cassette between Tsx and Xite in a previously described (1lox) ΔXist ES cell line with a conditional Xist deletion (Csankovszki et al., 1999Csankovszki G. Panning B. Bates B. Pehrson J.R. Jaenisch R. Conditional deletion of Xist disrupts histone macroH2A localization but not maintenance of X inactivation.Nat.

X chromosome choice occurs independently of asynchronous replication timing.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Figure 6A). Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of the remaining part of Xist, and Tsix, and Xite, designated ΔXist-Tsix-Xite (ΔXTX), was confirmed by Southern and PCR analysis (Figures 6B–6E). RNA FISH analysis of undifferentiated XXΔXTX cell lines with an Xist probe detecting Tsix transcription showed a single pinpoint signal (n = 100), also confirming that the remaining part of Tsix has been deleted from the ΔXist allele (Figure 6F). To explore the pattern of XCI in differentiating XXΔXTX ES cell lines, we subjected EB differentiated cells to DNA/RNA FISH using an Xist RNA probe in combination with an X chromosome-specific Bac probe (day 3) or an X chromosome paint probe (day 7). Since the ΔXTX and ΔXist cell lines had a tendency to become XO, (reported to occur for many inbred lines) cells with two X chromosomes were selected prior to examination for an Xist signal. Interestingly, ∼38% of the cells at day 3 of differentiation and ∼87% of the cells at day 7 of differentiation showed an Xist RNA cloud, similar to the percentages obtained with the ΔXist cell lines. Both at day 7 and, more pronounced at day 3, the percentages of cells which initiated XCI were lower for the ΔXTX and ΔXist lines than for the wild-type control. We attribute this difference to the fact that in both the ΔXTX and ΔXist cells only one X chromosome has a probability to initiate XCI while wild-type female cells have a probability to initiate XCI on two X chromosomes. To test our findings in vivo, we injected the XXΔXTX ES cells into blastocysts and generated chimeras. In the second litter of the female founder, two out of nine embryos contained an XΔXTX chromosome (Figures 6I and 6J). This was verified by Southern blotting (data not shown). PCR analysis with Sry-specific primers indicated that one ΔXTX embryo was male and one female (Figure 6K). The XXΔXTX and XΔXTXY embryos did not show any structural abnormalities or growth retardation (Figure 6I). MEFs were derived from all embryos and subjected to DNA/RNA FISH (Xist probe and two BAC probes). We observed Xist RNA clouds in 99% of the XXΔXTX MEFs and 98% of the wild-type MEFs, confirming our finding with the XXΔXTX ES cell lines (Figure 6L). These data demonstrate that female diploid cells show XCI despite the XTX-deletion and confirm that the probability to initiate XCI is determined independently by each X chromosome. Since XO and XY ES cells do not initiate XCI, these results also indicate the presence of an, as yet unidentified, X-encoded trans-acting factor located outside the deleted region that is required for XCI. What factors determine the probability for an X chromosome to inactivate? Studies with Xist promoter driven transgenes show a clear difference in expression between differentiating male and female ES cells, indicating the presence of a sex-linked transcription factor driving Xist expression (Sun et al., 2006Sun B.K. Deaton A.M. Lee J.T. A transient heterochromatic state in Xist preempts X inactivation choice without RNA stabilization.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, more abundant Xist expression has been correlated with a weaker Xce allele in mice (Brockdorff et al., 1991Brockdorff N. Ashworth A. Kay G.F. Cooper P. Smith S. McCabe V.M. Norris D.P. Penny G.D. Patel D. Rastan S. Conservation of position and exclusive expression of mouse Xist from the inactive X chromosome.Nature. 1991; 351: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), suggesting that the level of Xist expression could be a positive parameter correlating with XCI-probability. An additional parameter is Tsix, known as a negative regulator of Xist. Previous studies have shown that introduction of a stop cassette in Tsix prematurely abrogates Tsix transcription and results in almost exclusive inactivation of the mutated X chromosome (Luikenhuis et al., 2001Luikenhuis S. Wutz A. Jaenisch R. Antisense transcription through the Xist locus mediates Tsix function in embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8512-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Conversely, if Tsix expression persists upon differentiation, the wild-type allele is always selected for inactivation (Luikenhuis et al., 2001Luikenhuis S. Wutz A. Jaenisch R. Antisense transcription through the Xist locus mediates Tsix function in embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8512-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Tsix expression reduces the probability by inhibiting Xist expression. Therefore, abolishing Tsix expression greatly increases the probability of that allele to initiate XCI, and implies that XCI initiation should occur faster on the Tsix-stop allele compared to the wild-type allele. To test this hypothesis we analyzed Xist cloud formation by RNA FISH in the heterozygous Tsix-stop female ES cell line (Luikenhuis et al., 2001Luikenhuis S. Wutz A. Jaenisch R. Antisense transcription through the Xist locus mediates Tsix function in embryonic stem cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8512-8520Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) at different time points of differentiation. Indeed, analysis of XCI in wild-type and Tsix-stop cells showed that the Tsix-stop cells initiate XCI much faster compared to wild-type cells (Figures 7A–7C). Also, the number of cells with two Xist clouds is significantly reduced compared to wild-type cells at all time points measured (Figure 7C). Because XCI in Tsix-stop cells is skewed toward inactivation of the mutated allele, we conclude that initiation of XCI is initiated faster on the mutated allele than the wild-type allele. The reduced number of cells with two Xi-s is most likely due to the fact that the mutated X chromosome generates a probability to initiate XCI well before the wild-type allele does, and as a consequence only in a few cells will both X chromosomes have a probability to initiate XCI. Our results showing accelerated initiation of XCI in Tsix stop cells, is consistent with the finding that Xist promoter methylation is detected much earlier in cells with a heterozygous ΔCpG Tsix deletion compared to wild-type cells, indicating that the XCI process is accelerated on the mutant X chromosome (Sun et al., 2006Sun B.K. Deaton A.M. Lee J.T. A transient heterochromatic state in Xist preempts X inactivation choice without RNA stabilization.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We find that in the course of the XCI process a significant proportion of cells do not comply with the 1Xa/diploid genome rule and have less or more than the expected number of Xi-s. This finding suggests that XCI is a stochastic process with an independent probability for each X chromosome to initiate XCI and that this probability is directly proportional to the X:ploidy ratio. These results also suggest the presence of an X-encoded probability-promoting factor, which is located outside the region we deleted in our female ΔXTX lines. Our finding that 10 day differentiated XXXX tetraploid ES cells preferably inactivate two X chromosomes is in agreement with Webb et al., 1992Webb S. de Vries T.J. Kaufman M.H.

https://openalex.org/W2002309357,"Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB(1)) is an abundant G protein-coupled receptor, involved in a number of physiological processes. This receptor is localized at the plasma membrane, as well as in intracellular vesicles. The trafficking events leading to this intracellular localization remain controversial. In this study, we examine the differential trafficking of CB(1) receptors and its implication on signaling. We find that the transfected tagged receptors are predominantly at the plasma membrane, whereas endogenous receptors exhibit an intracellular localization. We also find that intracellular endogenous CB(1) receptors do not have an endocytic origin. Instead, these receptors associate with the adaptor protein AP-3 and traffic to the lysosomes. siRNA-mediated AP-3delta knockdown leads to enhanced cell surface localization of CB(1) receptors. Finally, we show that CB(1) receptors in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment are associated with heterotrimeric G proteins and mediate signal transduction. These results suggest that intracellular CB(1) receptors are functional and that their spatial segregation is likely to significantly affect receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2084707133,"In mammals, Sirt1, a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, functions as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent protein deactylase, and has important physiological roles, including the regulation of glucose metabolism, cell survival, and mitochondrial respiration. The initial investigations of Sirt1 deficient mice have revealed a phenotype that includes a reduced lifespan, small size, and an increased frequency of abnormal sperm. We have now performed a detailed analysis of the molecular and functional effects of Sirt1 deficiency in the germ line of Sirt1 knock-out (−/−) mice. We find that Sirt1 deficiency markedly attenuates spermatogenesis, but not oogenesis. Numbers of mature sperm and spermatogenic precursors, as early as d15.5 of development, are significantly reduced (∼2-10-fold less; P≤0.004) in numbers in Sirt1−/− mice, whereas Sirt1 deficiency did not effect the efficiency oocyte production following superovulation of female mice. Furthermore, the proportion of mature sperm with elevated DNA damage (∼7.5% of total epididymal sperm; P = 0.02) was significantly increased in adult Sirt1−/− males. Analysis of global gene expression by microarray analysis in Sirt1 deficient testis revealed dysregulated expression of 85 genes, which were enriched (P<0.05) for genes involved in spermatogenesis and protein sumoylation. To assess the function of Sirt1 deficient germ cells, we compared the efficiency of generating embryos and viable offspring in in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments using gametes from Sirt1−/− and sibling Sirt1+/− mice. While viable animals were derived in both Sirt1−/− X wild type and Sirt1−/− X Sirt1−/− crosses, the efficiency of producing both 2-cell zygotes and viable offspring was diminished when IVF was performed with Sirt1−/− sperm and/or oocytes. Together, these data support an important role for Sirt1 in spermatogenesis, including spermatogenic stem cells, as well as germ cell function."

We also show that Otu1 interacts with Cdc48, a regulator of the ER-associated degradation pathway. We also report the x-ray crystal structure of the OTU domain of Otu1 covalently complexed with ubiquitin and carry out structure-guided mutagenesis revealing a novel mode of ubiquitin recognition and a variation on the papain protease catalytic site configuration that appears to be conserved within the OTU family of ubiquitin hydrolases.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 5Fang S. Weissman A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1546-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lys48-linked polyubiquitination serves to target and deliver specific proteins to the proteasome for degradation, whereas monoubiquitination and Lys63-linked polyubiquitination signal nondegradative events (6Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 7Babst M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Deubiquitination involves the hydrolysis of these isopeptide bonds and requires the activity of a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) (8Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). DUBs can be divided into six distinct families: the ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs), the ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), the Ataxin-3/Josephin domains, the ovarian tumor domain-containing proteases (OTUs) (9Nanao M.H.

The JAMM metalloproteases are unique among the DUBs in that zinc is required to catalyze the reaction (13Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), whereas the other DUB families use an active site cysteine to hydrolyze the isopeptide bond between ubiquitin and the target. Although much is known, both structurally and biochemically, about UBPs and UCHs, relatively little is known about OTU domains.The ovarian tumor (Otu) gene was originally identified as a gene required for Drosophila oogenesis (14Steinhauer W.R. Walsh R.C. Kalfayan L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5726-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Otu gene product is involved in the control of cell division and differentiation of the cystoblast into an oocyte and 15 nurse cells (15Rodesch C. Geyer P.K. Patton J.S. Bae E. Nagoshi R.N. Genetics. 1995; 141: 191-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sass G.L. Comer A.R. Searles L.L. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Located within the Drosophila Otu gene is an ∼130-residue domain that is highly conserved from human to yeast (17Glenn L.E. Searles L.L. Mech. Dev. 2001; 102: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This region, termed the OTU domain, displays weak similarity to the papain-like family of proteases (18Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 50-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The OTU domain is found in a number of conserved genes from all eukaryotes and a number of viruses that infect eukaryotes. For example, the OTU domain is found in the tumor necrosis factor α-induced protein, A20. A20 protects cells from apoptosis and blocks activation of lymphoid cells by negatively regulating NF-κB, presumably by altering the ubiquitination state of proteins involved in the signaling pathway (19Evans P.C. Ovaa H. Hamon M. Kilshaw P.J. Hamm S. Bauer S. Ploegh H.L. Smith T.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Lee E.G. Boone D.L. Chai S. Libby S.L. Chien M. Lodolce J.P. Ma A. Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two open reading frames contain the OTU domain (Otu1 and Otu2).Recently, Rumpf and Jentsch (21Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have implicated yeast Otu1 in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Otu1 and numerous other proteins interact with Cdc48, an AAA ATPase that plays a central role in the ERAD pathway by chaperoning proteins to the proteasome for destruction. Ufd3, a protein of unknown function, and Ufd2, a so-called E4 ubiquitin ligase, also interact with Cdc48 and promote the degradation of ubiquitin fusion proteins. Both Otu1 and Ufd3 can independently counteract the activity of Ufd2 by separate mechanisms. In the case of Otu1, the deubiquitination activity of Otu1 seems to act to remove ubiquitin molecules from Ufd2 substrates. Interestingly, overexpression of Otu1 is able to suppress the Δufd3 mutant.The structure of an OTU domain, from human otubain 2, was determined by Balakirev et al. (9Nanao M.H. Tcherniuk S.O. Chroboczek J. Dideberg O. Dessen A. Balakirev M.Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The structure reveals a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helical domains that is novel for DUB enzymes. Despite the novel DUB fold and low sequence homology with other DUB families, otubain 2 shows a similar active site configuration with UCHs and UBP deubiquitinating enzymes.In this report, we examine the substrate preference and enzymatic activity of Otu1 and show that it preferentially hydrolyzes polyubiquitin chains with Lys48 linkages and that an NH2-terminal ubiquitin fold domain in Otu1 mediates interaction with Cdc48. The Otu1/Cdc48 oligomer preferentially binds polyubiquitin analogs, suggesting a role in polyubiquitin metabolism. We also report the x-ray crystal structure of the OTU domain of Otu1 in covalent complex with ubiquitin and carry out structure-guided mutagenesis revealing a novel mode of ubiquitin recognition and a variation on the papain protease catalytic site configuration that appears to be conserved within the OTU family of ubiquitin hydrolases. Implications of these studies for the molecular mechanism of Otu1 recognition of polyubiquitin and for the biochemical consequence of its association with Cdc48 are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of the Otu1-Ubiquitin Complex—The genes encoding amino acids 87-301 of Otu1 and full-length ubiquitin were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pTYB2 vector. Bacteria containing either the pTYB2-Otu1ΔUBX (amino acids 87-301) or pTYB2-ubiquitin-(1-75) plasmids were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to a density of A600 of 0.6-0.8 and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the cell lysates were bound to a pre-equilibrated chitin column (New England Biolabs) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1 m NaCl. Chemical cleavage of the Otu1-intein-chitin binding domain fusion was performed using a solution containing 50 mm DTT overnight at 25 °C. The sample was then run over a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and frozen at -70 °C until further use. Selenomethionine-substituted Otu1 was prepared by transforming the pTYB2-Otu1-(87-301) construct into the methionine auxotroph strain, B834 (Novagen), and growing and inducing the cells in a minimal medium (Molecular Dimension, Ltd.) containing 50 μg/liter selenomethionine (Sigma).To create a covalent Otu1 complex with ubiquitin, an irreversible ubiquitin inhibitor was created, ubiquitin-Br3, in which glycine 76 was substituted with a bromopropylamine group as described in Ref. 22Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar. Briefly, after attaching the ubiquitin-intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein to the chitin column, cleavage was carried out overnight using 50 mm β-mercaptoethanesulfonate sodium salt. After elution and concentration, 0.2 mmol of 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide (Sigma) and 100 μl of 2 m sodium hydroxide were added to 500 μl of ∼2 mg/ml ubiquitin-β-mercaptoethanesulfonate sodium salt. The tubes were vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, after which 100 μl of HCl was added. The solution was then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, for 2 h and then dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine overnight. The solution of Ub-Br3 was then concentrated to ∼1.5 mg/ml. To create the Otu1-ubiquitin complex, concentrated Otu1 was mixed with Ub-Br3 in 1:1 stoichiometric amounts in a solution containing 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The complex was enriched using a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) with a NaCl gradient at pH 8.5 and further purified on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Fractions containing the Otu1-Ub-Br3 complex were concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml for crystallization.Crystallization and Structure Determination—All crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Orthorhombic crystals were obtained by mixing 2 μl of 15 mg/ml protein complex with 2 μl of reservoir solution and equilibrating over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 100-250 mm magnesium chloride, 16-21% polyethylene glycol 3350. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cells dimensions of a = 46.3, b = 73.1, and c = 89.3 Å and contain 1 complex per asymmetric unit cell. A hexagonal crystal form of the protein complex was prepared by mixing 2 μl of 15 mg/ml protein complex with 2 μl of reservoir and equilibration solution containing 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 50-200 mm ammonium acetate, 17-22% polyethylene glycol 3350. The hexagonal crystals belong to the space group P64 and have unit cell dimension of a = 107.3, b = 107.3, and c = 98.9 Å and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit cell.To determine phases, orthorhombic crystals were soaked for 4 h in a 5 mm potassium tetracyanoplatinate, K2Pt(CN)4, solution (Hampton Research). For the hexagonal crystals, selenomethionine-substituted Otu1 protein was used for crystallization. Heavy atom-derivatized crystals were cryoprotected for data collection by transferring the crystals to a solution containing reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data for the Otu1-ubiquitin complex crystals were collected at the X29 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data processing was carried out with the HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar) implementation of the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK. Three-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion experiments were carried out for both the platinum-soaked orthorhombic crystals and the selenomethionine-substituted hexagonal crystals. Data for both complex crystal forms were treated and solved independently from each other. Data collection statistics are described in Table 1. Shelx (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 227: 319-343Crossref Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) was used to identify the heavy atom sites, and SHARP (25Bricogne G. Vonrhein C. Flensburg C. Schiltz M. Paciorek W. Acta Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) was used to refine their position, occupancy, and B-factors. Using the heavy atom sites, the initial experimental phases were calculated and improved by solvent flattening using DM (26Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). From the resultant electron density map, the program ARP/wARP (27Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) was able to unambiguously build a model of the OTU complex. Alternating rounds of model building and refinement were performed to get the R-factor to 18.9% and R-free to 21.1% using Phenix. There are 143 waters. Of all of the residues, 97.5% (241 residues) are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 2.5% (6 residues) are in the allowed regions, and none are in disallowed regions.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for the OTU-ubiquitin complexesOTU-ubiquitin complex (orthorhombic form, P212121 platinum-soaked)OTU-ubiquitin complex (hexagonal form, P64 Se-Met-substituted)0.9795 Å wavelength (native)1.0722 Å wavelength (peak)1.0725 Å wavelength (inflection)1.0450 Å wavelength (remote)0.9793 Å wavelength (peak)0.9795 Å wavelength (inflection)0.9566 Å wavelength (remote)Resolution (Å)50-1.50 (1.55-1.50)20-2.0 (2.07-2.00)20-2.0 (2.07-2.00)20-2.0 (2.07-2.00)50-2.31 (2.39-2.31)50-2.31 (2.39-2.31)50-2.45 (2.56-2.45)Observations314,652295,383295,672296,114517,121360,539263,582Unique reflections48,644 (4677)39,220 (3893)39,562 (3941)39,392 (3931)28,554 (2785)28,173 (2553)23,627 (2740)Completeness (%)98.6 (96.4)99.9 (100)99.9 (99.9)99.9 (100)99.8 (98.2)98.3 (89.4)98.1 (91.4)I/σ46.8 (3.2)11.5 (13.8)20.0 (5.08)25.8 (9.11)30.2 (7.12)26.6 (3.29)23.7 (2.75)Rsym4.6 (38.0)9.5 (16.4)9.5 (38.1)7.3 (22.8)8.0 (35.7)7.2 (52.9)6.7 (62.9)Rworking18.9%19.6%Rfree21.1%24.3%Root mean square deviation, bond length (Å)0.0050.010Root mean square deviation, angle (degrees)0.851.23 Open table in a new tab Preparation of Full-length Otu1—Full-length Otu1 was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into the pRSET vector. Escherichia coli cells harboring pRSET-Otu1 were inoculated into LB medium at 37 °C and grown to A600 of 0.6. Cultures were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was shifted to 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. Lysozyme and sonication were used to lyse the cells, and after centrifugation the cell lysate was loaded on a Fast Flow Q (Amersham Biosciences) column. Fractions that had high amounts of DUB activity using ubiquitin 7-amidomethylcourmarin (Ub-AMC) as a substrate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and determined to be >95% pure. Active Otu1 fractions were pooled and dialyzed against sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 10 mm DTT and frozen at -80 °C for later use.Otu1 Binding to Ub4 Analog Resins—Purified Otu1 (100 ng) was diluted to 500 μl in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT) and incubated with 100 μl of the appropriate Ub4 resin for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Identical experiments using ethanolamine blocked NHS-activated Sepharose (i.e. no conjugated ubiquitin) or a monoubiquitin resin were performed as negative controls. After incubation, reactions were briefly centrifuged, and the supernatants were removed and saved for SDS-PAGE analysis. Resin-bound Otu1 was batch-eluted by boiling in 500 μl of SDS-sample buffer. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Sypro Ruby Red (Invitrogen) or Imperial (Pierce) staining to estimate the amounts of Otu1 present (28Russell N.S. Identification and Characterization of Polyubiquitin-binding Proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Using Polyubiquitin Analogs. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA2005Google Scholar).Otu1 Deubiquitination Assay—300 ng of Otu1 and 250 ng of the appropriate Ub4 chain (gift of C. Pickart) were diluted to 30 μl in reaction buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, MgCl2, and DTT). A control reaction lacking enzyme was also prepared for each polyubiquitin chain analyzed. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The reactions were then quenched with 3× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Five μl of each reaction was then loaded onto a 10-20% gradient Tricine gel (Bio-Rad). For Western analysis, the protein was transferred to nitrocellulose in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.0, for 1 h at 100 V. After blocking with a 5% milk solution for 1 h, the blot was washed and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody, Ub (P4D1), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for 1 h. Primary antibody was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection.Otu1 Ubiquitin-AMC Kinetics—All reactions were performed in a 200-μl cuvette at 37 °C using an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer to collect data. Settings for the analysis were as follows: excitation wavelength of 340 nm, emission wavelength of 440 nm, a sensitivity of 680 V, and an analysis time of 300 s. Kinetic parameters were determined from the linear phase of each reaction. 124 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml ovalbumin) with varying amounts of Ub-AMC were mixed in the cuvette and allowed to thermoequilibrate in the spectrometer for 2 min. Thirty s after the start of a run, Otu1 was added to the cuvette to 0.5 nm and mixed, and the cuvette was returned to the spectrometer for luminescence measurements.Identification of Otu1 Interactors—Lysates were prepared from ΔOtu1 cells (strain gift of A. Corbett). The appropriate Ub4 analog or control resins (100 μl) were incubated separately with each of the following: 1) 500 μl of ΔOtu1 lysate, 2) 2 μg of full-length Otu1 or NH2-terminally truncated Otu1 diluted to 500 μl in lysate buffer, and 3) 500 μl of ΔOtu1 lysate supplemented with 2 μg of the appropriate Otu1. Binding reactions were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After binding, the resin was pelleted by a brief centrifugation at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was removed. Resins were washed with 1 ml oflysate buffer followed by two 1-ml washes of lysate buffer without Triton X-100. After washing, resins were eluted by adding 500 μl of SDS sample buffer, mixing, and boiling for 3 min. Twenty μl of each elution fraction was loaded and run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel that was then stained with Sypro Ruby Red. Potential interactors (bands present in incubation 3 elution fractions but not in incubation 1 or 2) were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis as previously described (28Russell N.S. Identification and Characterization of Polyubiquitin-binding Proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Using Polyubiquitin Analogs. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Biochemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA2005Google Scholar).Demonstration of Direct Cdc48-Otu1 Interaction—An Otu1 affinity resin was synthesized by conjugating full-length Otu1 to Sulfolink (Pierce) resin. Otu1 was prepared for conjugation, and conjugation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that β-mercaptoethanol was used to block unused active sites after Otu1 conjugation rather than the suggested l-cysteine.All binding experiments were performed in duplicate with or without the presence of 1 mm ATP in the binding buffer. Control or Otu1-Sulfolink resin (50 μl) was equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100). After equilibration, 17 μg of His6Cdc48 in binding buffer plus a protease inhibitor mixture (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, chymostatin at final concentrations of 3 μg/ml) was added to the resins, mixed, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After binding, the mixtures were briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. Resins were then washed twice in 500 μl with binding buffer followed by two 500-μl washes using binding buffer without Triton. Resins were then eluted with 1 ml of 8 m urea plus 1 mm HCl buffer. Five μl of each elution was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose and prepared for Western analysis by standard procedures. The blot was incubated with anti-His6 antibody at a 1:2000 dilution for 60 min. The blot was then incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min at a 1:4000 dilution. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection.RESULTSOtu1 Substrate Specificity—Rumpf and Jentsch (21Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) showed that yeast Otu1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme. To determine the functionality of our recombinant protein, we labeled recombinant full-length Otu1 with ubiquitin-vinyl sulfone (UbVS), an active site-directed irreversible inhibitor that reacts specifically with the active site cysteine of DUBs. Titration of 100 ng of Otu1 with increasing amounts of UbVS clearly shows the formation of a covalent adduct migrating about 10 kDa higher than Otu1 alone on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Significantly, the quantitative UbVS labeling of Otu1 indicates that almost all of the recombinant Otu1 is enzymatically competent. UbVS also completely inhibits Otu1 cleavage of Ub-AMC in fluorometric assays, indicating that the UbVS binds to the Otu1 active site (data not shown).We next examined the specific activity of Otu1. Previous data suggested that Otu1 was a very sluggish DUB, with an estimated velocity of ∼0.01 s-1 at low substrate concentration (21Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We speculated that this slow activity might be due to the NH2-terminal ubiquitin foldlike (UBX) domain acting as an inhibitor by occupying the ubiquitin binding site of the enzyme. To test this hypothesis, recombinant full-length Otu1 and a truncated version missing an 86-residue NH2-terminal UBX domain, herein called Otu1ΔUBX, were incubated with increasing concentrations of the generic DUB substrate, Ub-AMC. Cleavage of Ub-AMC was monitored by the release of the fluorescent AMC molecule (Fig. 1B). These experiments reveal comparable kinetic behavior for both proteins with no evidence of saturation below 2 μm Ub-AMC and an apparent kcat/Km of 1 × 103m-1 s-1. This result shows that the UBX fold does not participate in catalysis by Otu1. We next asked whether Cdc48 association with Otu1 has an effect on the deubiquitination activity of Otu1. The ability of the Cdc48-Otu1 complex to cleave Ub-AMC was analyzed and found to be only slightly slower than that catalyzed by Otu1 alone (Fig. 1C). This result shows that the association of Cdc48 with Otu1 has little effect on hydrolyzing ubiquitin-AMC, although this experiment does not eliminate the possibility that other proteins that interact with Otu1 or Cdc48 might alter the deubiquitination activity of Otu1 in a Cdc48-dependent or independent way. Together, these results show that Otu1 contains modest DUB activity but little affinity for monoubiquitin.It has been previously shown that Otu1 also cleaves polyubiquitin and that a 4-fold molar excess of enzyme cleaved Lys48-linked chains somewhat more efficiently than Lys63-linked chains (21Rumpf S. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Chains of three or fewer ubiquitins were not cleaved at all. We extended these studies using stoichiometric amounts of Otu1 incubated with Lys29, Lys48, or Lys63-linked Ub4, and the reaction was analyzed for deubiquitination activity with anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. This analysis demonstrates that Otu1 has a clear preference for Lys48-linked Ub4, although it has some activity on K63-linked Ub4 as well (Fig. 1D). Lys29-linked chains were not cleaved at all. It is notable that the extent of chain cleavage is very limited. It appears that single cleavage events are detected, with the majority of cleavages occurring in the middle of the tetraubiquitin chain. This suggests that the enzyme may be unable to efficiently release product and brings up the possibility that the action of the Cdc48 chaperone is necessary to release bound products. Alternatively, the enzyme may prefer to cleave in the middle of a chain releasing diubiquitin.Substrate Binding by Otu1—To determine if Otu1 preferentially bound polyubiquitin chains over monoubiquitin and if Cdc48 or other cellular cofactors modulated this ubiquitin binding activity, we carried out binding studies of recombinant Otu1 to mono-Ub and Ub4 analog resins (28Russell N.S.

https://openalex.org/W2062293705,"The acquisition of new traits through horizontal gene transfer depends on the ability of the recipient organism to express the incorporated genes. However, foreign DNA appears to be silenced by the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein (H-NS) in several enteric pathogens, raising the question of how this silencing is overcome and the acquired genes are expressed at the right time and place. To address this question, we investigated transcription of the horizontally acquired ugtL and pagC genes from Salmonella enterica, which is dependent on the regulatory DNA-binding proteins PhoP and SlyA. We reconstituted transcription of the ugtL and pagC genes in vitro and determined occupancy of their respective promoters by PhoP, H-NS, and RNA polymerase in vivo. The SlyA protein counteracted H-NS-promoted repression in vitro but could not promote gene transcription by itself. PhoP-promoted transcription required SlyA when H-NS was present but not in its absence. In vivo, H-NS remained bound to the ugtL and pagC promoters under inducing conditions that promoted RNA polymerase recruitment and transcription of the ugtL and pagC genes. Our results indicate that relief of H-NS repression and recruitment of RNA polymerase are controlled by different regulatory proteins that act in concert to express horizontally acquired genes."

We recently identified a novel EP4 receptor-associated protein (EPRAP), whose function in PGE2-mediated anti-inflammation remains undefined. Here we demonstrate that PGE2 pretreatment selectively inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor κB1 (NF-κB1) p105 phosphorylation and degradation in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages through EP4-dependent mechanisms. Similarly, directed EPRAP expression in RAW264.7 cells suppresses LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation and degradation, and subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2. Forced expression of EPRAP also inhibits NF-κB activation induced by various proinflammatory stimuli in a concentration-dependent manner. In co-transfected cells, EPRAP, which contains multiple ankyrin repeat motifs, directly interacts with NF-κB1 p105/p50 and forms a complex with EP4. In EP4-overexpressing cells, PGE2 enhances the protective action of EPRAP against stimulus-induced p105 phosphorylation, whereas EPRAP silencing in RAW264.7 cells impairs the inhibitory effect of PGE2-EP4 signaling on LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation. Additionally, EPRAP knockdown as well as deficiency of NF-κB1 in macrophages attenuates the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on LPS-induced MIP-1β production. Thus, PGE2-EP4 signaling augments NF-κB1 p105 protein stability through EPRAP after proinflammatory stimulation, limiting macrophage activation.

Thus, the regulation of macrophage activation holds a key to understanding the pathophysiology and rational treatment of these conditions.

PGE2 has four known G-protein-coupled receptors, designated EP1–EP4. Each EP receptor shows distinct tissue distribution and tightly regulated expression, suggesting the pivotal roles of PGE2-EP receptor signaling in maintaining local homeostasis under a variety of pathophysiological settings (8Sugimoto Y.

Macrophages express EP4 more abundantly than other PGE receptors, such as EP2. EP4 as well as EP2 mainly couple to Gs asaGα subunit and increase intracellular cAMP levels upon PGE2 ligation. In animals, EP4 signaling protects against experimental inflammatory bowel disease (9Kabashima K. Saji T. Murata T. Nagamachi M. Matsuoka T. Segi E. Tsuboi K. Sugimoto Y. Kobayashi T. Miyachi Y. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and reduces inflammatory bone resorption (10Yoshida K. Oida H. Kobayashi T. Maruyama T.

A. 2002; 99: 4580-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously reported that PGE2 markedly suppressed production of a number of chemokines in LPS-stimulated human primary macrophages (11Takayama K. Garcia-Cardena G. Sukhova G.K. Comander J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44147-44154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Notably, PGE2 pretreatment selectively diminished responses to various proinflammatory stimuli by macrophages but not by vascular endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells. Further data indicated involvement of EP4 signaling in this anti-inflammatory function of PGE2 (11Takayama K. Garcia-Cardena G. Sukhova G.K. Comander J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44147-44154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). We then isolated a novel EP4 receptor-associated protein (EPRAP), using the yeast two-hybrid screening method with a human bone marrow cDNA library (12Takayama K. Sukhova G.K. Chin M.T. Libby P. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EPRAP contains eight ankyrin repeat motifs but has no predicted enzymatic or catalytic domain. The EPRAP counterpart in mice, Fem1a (13Ventura-Holman T. Seldin M.F. Li W. Maher J.F. Genomics. 1998; 54: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), has homology with Caenorhabditis elegans FEM-1, which participates in nematode sex determination (14Spence A.M. Coulson A. Hodgkin J. Cell. 1990; 60: 981-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), yet the biological functions of mammalian Fem1 families remain unknown. Because ankyrin repeat commonly mediates protein-protein interactions between molecules that figure importantly in signal transduction, including Notch and inhibitor of NF-κB(IκB) family proteins (15Li J. Mahajan A. Tsai M.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15168-15178Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 16Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that EPRAP interacts with proinflammatory signaling molecules and inhibits macrophage activation. Here we demonstrate that EPRAP associates directly with NF-κB1 p105/p50. Through EP4/EPRAP-dependent mechanisms, PGE2 attenuates stimulus-induced phosphorylation and degradation of p105, an important cytoplasmic inhibitor of NF-κB and MEK activation. PGE2 also augments IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated macrophages independently of EP4 and EPRAP. These observations add new insights into the mechanisms that may mitigate unchecked macrophage activation at sites of inflammation and suggest EP4-EPRAP signaling as a novel target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Reagents, Antibodies, and cDNA Constructs—PGE2 and Butaprost were from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), LPS (Escherichia coli O55: B5) was from Calbiochem. Human recombinant TNFα and IL-1β were from Pierce. Antibodies against phospho-p105 (Ser933), phospho-IκBα (Ser32/36), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), MEK1/2, p65, and β-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); anti-mouse p105/p50 antibody was from Abcom (Cambridge, MA); anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma; anti-V5 and anti-lamin B1 antibodies were from Invitrogen; and antibodies against p105/p50, Tpl2, α-tubulin, and GFP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The expression vectors for C terminus FLAG-tagged human EP4, C terminus V5-tagged human EPRAP and deletion mutants, and C terminus GFP-tagged human NF-κB family proteins (p65, p50, p105, and p105-ΔN) were constructed by PCR and subcloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma), pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen), and pGFP2-N vector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. Mouse EP4 as well as EPRAP expression constructs were also generated by PCR and subcloned into pIRES2-eGFP vector (Clontech). All cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Mice—Homozygotic EP4-deficient mice (EP4–/–) and wild type (WT) on the same genetic background (EP4+/+) were obtained by crossing mice heterozygous for ptger4 gene mutation (EP4+/–) and verified as previously described (17Nguyen M. Camenisch T. Snouwaert J.N. Hicks E. Coffman T.M. Anderson P.A. Malouf N.N. Koller B.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Because EP4–/– mice only survive on a recombinant inbred strain, all EP4–/– and EP4+/+ mice used in this study were on the mixed background, composed of 129/Olac, C57BL/6, and DBA/2 (17Nguyen M. Camenisch T. Snouwaert J.N. Hicks E. Coffman T.M. Anderson P.A. Malouf N.N. Koller B.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). IL-10–/– mice (18Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W. Cell. 1993; 75: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3688) Google Scholar), nfkb1–/– mice (19Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar), and their WT controls (nfkb1+/+) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were bred in a specific pathogen-free environment. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Animal Research Committee of Harvard Medical School and in accordance with institutional guidelines. Cell Culture—Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were prepared as previously described (20Warren M.K. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 982-989PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, bone marrow cells were isolated from 8–10-week-old male mice and plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml mouse recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA). After 7 days of culture, adherent macrophages were harvested for further experiments. RAW264.7 cells (ATCC number TIB-71) and HEK293 cells (ATCC number CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Transient transfection in HEK293 cells was performed with FuGENE HD Reagent (Roche Applied Science), and transfection in RAW264.7 cells was performed using Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR)—Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and cDNA was synthesized with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen). The mRNA level for each target gene was quantified by SYBR Green-based qPCR using the iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences used for this study are available as supplemental material (Table S1). Data were normalized using β-actin as a reference gene, and quantification of the results was performed by the standard curve method using a plasmid containing each target PCR fragment as a cDNA control (21Giulietti A. Overbergh L. Valckx D. Decallonne B. Bouillon R. Mathieu C. Methods. 2001; 25: 386-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in triplicate. Protein Analyses—To detect the interaction between EPRAP and NF-κB1, cells were lysed with Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Brij 58, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Protein extracts were precleared by nonimmune control IgG, followed by immunoprecipitation with antibody against either V5, GFP, or p105/p50, coupled with Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To detect the binding of EP4 to EPRAP or NF-κB1, cells were lysed with Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 2% ASB-14 (Sigma)), followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. To examine the interaction of p105 and Tpl2 in RAW264.7 cells, cells were lysed with Buffer C (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma)), followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-mouse p105/p50 antibody. Immune complexes were eluted from the beads and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblot analyses, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). To quantify the level of the phosphorylated forms of p105, bolts were scanned and analyzed by densitometry with Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The blot intensity of phosphorylated p105 was normalized to that of β-actin. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Quantitative determinations of MIP-1β and IL-10 concentration in cell culture supernatants were performed by sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Measurement of each sample was performed in triplicate. NF-κB Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter construct containing an NF-κB consensus enhancer element (-GGGAATTTCC-) (Clontech), a LacZ expression vector (Invitrogen), and increasing amounts of a human EPRAP cDNA expression construct as well as mock plasmid for adjusting the total amount of DNA to 0.3 μg/well. At 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with either TNFα (25 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. Secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter activity was measured in supernatant from cell-conditioned media (Clontech). Transfection was performed in triplicate in each experiment, and transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase activity in cell extracts collected from each well (Clontech). NF-κB Translocation and DNA Binding Assay—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained as previously described (22Feinberg M.W. Shimizu K. Lebedeva M. Haspel R. Takayama K. Chen Z. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Simon D.I. Libby P. Mitchell R.N. Jain M.K. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To quantify the DNA binding activity of p50 or p65 to NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide, ELISA-based DNA binding assays were performed (Panomics, Redwood City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclear extracts were incubated with the biotinylated oligonucleotides containing an NF-κB consensus binding site (NF-κB probe). The oligonucleotides with activated NF-κB molecules were then immobilized on a streptavidin-coated plate. An antibody directed against the NF-κB subunit, p50 or p65, detected each NF-κB molecule bound to the probe, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The amounts of p50 or p65 subunits bound to the NF-κB consensus probe were quantified by a colorimetric method. The specific binding was verified by competition studies using nonlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding with the probe. All reactions were performed in triplicate. RNA Interference—Mouse EPRAP silencing was performed by transfection in RAW264.7 cells with a pool of EPRAP-specific siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) at 100 nm. As a control, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with nonspecific pooled siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were made by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PGE2 Has a Prolonged Anti-inflammatory Effect on LPS-stimulated Mouse BMDM—To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the EP4-mediated anti-inflammatory properties of PGE2, we used mouse BMDM, with or without target gene mutations. First, demonstrating that PGE2 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in WT BMDM (EP4+/+, on the same genetic background as EP4–/– BMDM) entailed performing kinetic analyses of LPS-induced gene expression with qPCR. In addition to inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNFα and IL-12p40), the levels of expression of several chemokines increase in macrophages activated by proinflammatory stimuli, such as LPS. JE/mouse MCP-1/CCL2 is a well known chemoattractant for monocytes; MIP-1β/CCL4, IP-10/CXCL10, and RANTES/CCL5 function as chemoattractants and activators for T lymphocytes. Activated macrophages, especially classically activated macrophages, produce these chemokines (23Mantovani A. Sica A. Sozzani S. Allavena P. Vecchi A. Locati M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 677-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4586) Google Scholar, 24Martinez F.O. Sica A. Mantovani A. Locati M. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar), enhancing local inflammatory responses. As in human primary macrophages (11Takayama K. Garcia-Cardena G. Sukhova G.K. Comander J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44147-44154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), PGE2 pretreatment markedly suppressed LPS-induced proinflammatory gene expression (MIP-1β, TNFα, JE, IL-12p40, IP-10, and RANTES) in mouse BMDM (Fig. 1A). In each case, except for RANTES, PGE2 attenuated rapid gene induction at the onset of LPS stimulation and maintained inhibition for prolonged periods. PGE2 Suppresses LPS-induced Phosphorylation and Degradation of NF-κB1 p105 through EP4-dependent Mechanisms—Clarifying the particular role of EP4 signaling in PGE2-mediated anti-inflammatory actions involved kinetic analyses of LPS-induced gene expression through qPCR using EP4–/– BMDM. The levels of mRNAs encoding the studied proinflammatory molecules after LPS stimulation in EP4–/– macrophages exceeded those in WT (EP4+/+) BMDM (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, PGE2 pretreatment did not suppress rapid mRNA induction at the onset of LPS stimulation in EP4–/– macrophages, especially for MIP-1β, TNFα, and JE/MCP-1 (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that EP4 signaling interfered with proinflammatory signaling pathways promptly evoked by LPS. The transcription factor NF-κB participates centrally in gene expression induced by LPS and many other proinflammatory stimuli. Testing whether PGE2 modulates NF-κB activation entailed immunoblot analyses of extracts from LPS-stimulated BMDM with or without PGE2 pretreatment. Notably, PGE2-pretreated WT (EP4+/+) macrophages demonstrated considerably reduced accumulation of phosphorylated NF-κB1 p105 (Fig. 2A, left, representative blots; right, quantification by densitometry). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain leads to proteosomal degradation of p105 (25Lang V. Janzen J. Fischer G.Z. Soneji Y. Beinke S. Salmeron A. Allen H. Hay R.T. Ben-Neriah Y. Ley S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Viatour P. Merville M.P. Bours V. Chariot A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 43-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar); accordingly, PGE2 pretreatment attenuated the decline in p105 levels post-LPS (Fig. 2A). Upon LPS stimulation, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex predominantly mediates phosphorylation of the IκB proteins as well as that of p105 (27Salmeron A. Janzen J. Soneji Y. Bump N. Kamens J. Allen H. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22215-22222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); however, PGE2 pretreatment did not reduce IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), suggesting that inhibition of IKK activity may not mediate the protective action of PGE2 against inducible p105 phosphorylation. On the contrary, PGE2 pretreatment did not suppress LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation and the subsequent decline in p105 levels in EP4–/– macrophages (Fig. 2B, left, representative blots; right, quantification of phosphorylated p105 by densitometry). Thus, PGE2 attenuates LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation and degradation primarily through EP4-dependent mechanisms. Forced EPRAP Expression Suppresses p105 Phosphorylation/Degradation and Subsequent MEK1/2 Activation in a Mouse Macrophage-like Cell Line—Clarifying the role of EPRAP in anti-inflammatory signaling in macrophages involved transiently enforced mouse EPRAP expression in RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, similar to PGE2-pretreated macrophages, EPRAP-overexpressing cells had markedly impaired LPS-induced p105 phosphorylation and subsequent decline compared with the mock-transfected control (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation did not differ significantly (Fig. 3A). p105 directly interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase Tpl2/Cot and inhibits its activation (28Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Beinke S. Deka J. Lang V. Belich M.P. Walker P.A. Howell S. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, proteolytic degradation of p105 liberates Tpl2, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2. Notably, in accordance with the attenuated decline in p105 levels, EPRAP-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells had markedly reduced MEK1/2 phosphorylation induced by LPS (Fig. 3A). To explore the interaction of Tpl2 with p105, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with p105 and subjected to immunoblotting. As demonstrated in previous reports (31Aoki M. Hamada F. Sugimoto T. Sumida S. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22723-22732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), alternative translation initiation results in expression of two isoforms of Tpl2, M1- and M30-Tpl2 (Fig. 3B, bottom), and the longer isoform, M1-Tpl2, dissociates from p105 upon LPS stimulation (30Waterfield M.R. Zhang M. Norman L.P. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Notably, forced EPRAP expression in RAW264.7 cells resulted in impaired release of M1-Tpl2 from p105 after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3, B (top), representative blots; C, quantification of M1-Tpl2/p105 ratio by densitometry), suggesting that EPRAP attenuates MEK1/2 activation by inhibiting LPS-induced degradation of p105, a Tpl2 scaffold. Enforced EPRAP Expression Attenuates NF-κB Activation Induced by Various Stimuli—In addition to limiting MEK activation, p105 functions as a cytoplasmic NF-κB inhibitor through its association with p50, p65/Rel-A, or c-Rel subunit (32Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 33Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), which thereby remains sequestered in the cytoplasm. Examining the effect of EPRAP on NF-κB activation entailed analyzing the reporter gene in HEK293 cells co-transfected with various amounts of human EPRAP expression plasmid. Similar to RAW264.7 cells, EPRAP-overexpressing HEK293 cells showed substantial inhibition of TNFα-induced phosphorylation and degradation of p105 (see Fig. 6). Notably, forced EPRAP expression attenuated NF-κB activation evoked by TNFα and IL-1β in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In addition, EPRAP overexpression markedly suppressed TNFα-induced nuclear translocation of both p50 and p65 at each time point (Fig. 4B). Determining the DNA binding activity of each NF-κB subunit involved ELISA-based assays. In accordance with the inhibition of nuclear translocation, EPRAP-overexpressing cells demonstrated impaired TNFα-induced interactions of p50 and p65 with the NF-κB recognition site, in contrast to the mock-transfected control (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4EPRAP overexpression attenuates NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation induced by proinflammatory stimuli. A, EPRAP overexpression attenuates NF-κB activation induced by various stimuli in a dose-dependent manner. NF-κB reporter gene analyses were performed using HEK293 cells cotransfected with the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter plasmid, LacZ expression plasmid, and increasing amounts of human EPRAP expression construct (hEPRAP) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfection efficiency was normalized by β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Results are expressed relative to the values of unstimulated cells in mean ± S.E. #, p < 0.01; †, p < 0.005 for the indicated comparison. B, nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits. HEK293 cells transfected with either human EPRAP expression plasmid or mock plasmid were stimulated by TNFα (25 ng/ml) for increasing durations. Nuclear (nuc) and cytoplasmic (cyt) extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against p50, p65, or lamin B1 (loading control) (representative of three different experiments). C, DNA binding activity of p50 and p65 in the nuclear extracts of TNFα-stimulated HEK293 cells was determined by an ELISA-based DNA-binding assay. Data are representative of three independent experiments. Results were expressed as the mean OD value (450 nm) ± S.E. *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.01 for the indicated comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EPRAP Associates Directly with NF-κB1 p105/p50 and Forms a Complex with EP4—EPRAP contains multiple ankyrin repeat motifs, which mediate many protein-protein interactions, at both the N and C terminus (Fig. 5B, top, schematic representation of EPRAP domain structure). The inhibition of NF-κB1 documented above generated our hypothesis that EPRAP directly associates with NF-κB proteins. Indeed, in co-transfected HEK293 cells, V5-tagged EPRAP was co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-tagged p105 and p50 (Fig. 5A, top). In addition, an antibody against endogenous p105/p50 immunoprecipitated transiently expressed V5-tagged EPRAP (Fig. 5A, bottom). On the other hand, EPRAP did not bind to p65 (Fig. 5A, top), indicating that EPRAP selectively interacts with NF-κB1 p105/p50. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation studies using a series of deletion mutants revealed that ankyrin repeat motifs in EPRAP are critical to optimal interaction with p50 (Fig. 5B). Strikingly, EPRAP co-immunoprecipitated not only fulllength p105 but also p105 C terminus, p105-ΔN (amino acid residues 453–969) (Fig. 5C, top, schematic representation of p105 domain structure; middle, representative blots). These findings indicate that EPRAP associates with both the N terminus p50 subunit and the C terminus of p105. The interaction of EPRAP with p105 C terminus, which contains conserved target sequences for the IKK complex Pro-Glu-Ser-Thr-rich domain, probably contributes crucially to EPRAP-mediated protection against p105 phosphorylation and degradation. The C terminus of p105 also contains multiple ankyrin repeat motifs, which interact with NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 (Fig. 5C, top). Interestingly, full-length EPRAP and the N terminus with ankyrin repeat motifs (N-AR; ami"

It has also been suggested that different sets of nucleases are activated by different stimuli, and induce distinct patterns of DNA degradation. Here we report that apoptosis-enhancing nuclease (AEN) is a novel direct target gene of p53. AEN is induced by p53 with various DNA damage, and its expression is regulated by the phosphorylation status of p53. We demonstrate that AEN is a typical exonuclease with conserved exonuclease domains Exo I–III, and it targets both single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA. AEN induces apoptosis by itself, and the conserved domains are essential for both AEN nuclease activity and its apoptosis-inducing ability. AEN possesses nuclear and nucleolar localization signals, and it translocates from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm upon apoptosis induction. We also show the dislocation of nucleophosmin in conjunction with the translocation of AEN to the nucleoplasm, indicating the ability of AEN in nucleolus disruption. In addition, AEN is shown to be required for efficient DNA fragmentation in p53-dependent apoptosis. These results suggest that AEN is an important downstream mediator of p53 in apoptosis induction."

Three well matched cohorts were genotyped with seven common, potentially functional mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A SNP, nt13708 G/A, was significantly associated with MS susceptibility in all three cohorts. The nt13708A allele was associated with an increased risk of MS (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.28-2.26, P = 0.0002). Subsequent sequencing of the mtDNA of 50 individuals revealed that the nt13708 itself, rather than SNPs linked to it, was responsible for the association. However, the association of nt13708 G/A with MS was not significant in MS cohorts which were not well case-control matched, indicating that the significance of association was affected by the population structure of controls.Taken together, our finding identified the nt13708A variant as a susceptibility allele to MS, which could contribute to defining the role of the mitochondrial genome in MS pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2082467606,"The biogenesis of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins in mammalian cells is poorly understood. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is a pathway dedicated to cytosolic Fe-S protein maturation that involves several essential proteins. One of these is Nar1, which intriguingly is homologous to iron-only hydrogenases, ancient enzymes that catalyze the formation of hydrogen gas in anaerobic bacteria. There are two orthologues of Nar1 in mammalian cells, iron-only hydrogenase-like protein 1 (IOP1) and IOP2 (also known as nuclear prelamin A recognition factor). We examined IOP1 for a potential role in mammalian cytosolic Fe-S protein biogenesis. We found that knockdown of IOP1 in both HeLa and Hep3B cells decreases the activity of cytosolic aconitase, an Fe-S protein, but not that of mitochondrial aconitase. Knockdown of IOP2, in contrast, had no effect on either. The decrease in aconitase activity upon IOP1 knockdown is rescued by expression of a small interference RNA-resistant version of IOP1. Upon loss of its Fe-S cluster, cytosolic aconitase is known to be converted to iron regulatory protein 1, and consistent with this, we found that IOP1 knockdown increases transferrin receptor 1 mRNA levels and decreases ferritin heavy chain protein levels. IOP1 knockdown also leads to a decrease in activity of xanthine oxidase, a distinct cytosolic Fe-S protein. Taken together, these results provide evidence that IOP1 is involved in mammalian cytosolic Fe-S protein maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1995707457,"Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic receptor that recognizes viral RNA and activates the interferon-mediated innate antiviral response. To understand the mechanism of signal activation at the receptor level, we cloned, expressed, and purified human RIG-I containing the two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) followed by the C-terminal helicase domain. We found that recombinant RIG-I is a functional protein that interacts with double-stranded RNA with substantially higher affinity as compared with single-stranded RNA structures unless they contain a 5′-triphosphate group. Viral RNA binding to RIG-I stimulates the velocity of ATP hydrolysis by 33-fold, which at the cellular level translates into a 43-fold increase of interferon-β expression. In contrast, the isolated ATPase/helicase domain is constitutively activated while also retaining its RNA ligand binding properties. These results support the recent model by which RIG-I signaling is autoinhibited in the absence of RNA by intra-molecular interactions between the CARDs and the C terminus. Based on pH profile and metal ion dependence experiments, we propose that the active site of RIG-I cannot efficiently accommodate divalent cations under the RNA-free repressed conformation. Overall, these results show a direct correlation between RNA binding and ATPase enzymatic function leading to signal transduction and suggest that a tight control of ATPase activity by the CARDs prevents RIG-I signaling in the absence of viral RNA.

Both RIG-I and MDA-5 are modular proteins of ∼920 residues that contain an ATPase/helicase domain for RNA binding and two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) located in tandem at the N-terminal end of the protein (4Yoneyama M.

Notably, the Huh7.5 cell line of hepatocytes is particularly permissive to HCV and vesicular stomatitis virus infection as the result of a defective RIG-I protein bearing a single mutation in its first CARD (11Sumpter Jr., R.

For instance, the NS3/4A protease of HCV cleaves IPS-1 to prevent its interaction with RIG-I (9Meylan E. Curran J. Hofmann K. Moradpour D. Binder M. Bartenschlager R. Tschopp J.

Negative regulation of RIG-I signaling can also be mediated by cellular factors as a way to regulate uncontrolled production of interferon (IFN). Among them, LGP2 prevents the activation of RIG-I by sequestering its double-stranded RNA ligand (16Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. DiPerna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S.

The molecular mechanism of activation of RIG-I in response to RNA binding is still poorly understood. Although overexpression of the isolated CARDs induces a constitutive signaling independent from viral infection, mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that full-length RIG-I requires a functional ATPase to activate the response leading to IFN production (4Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Akira S. Yonehara S. Kato A. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that RIG-I signaling is intrinsically inhibited by intramolecular interactions between the CARDs and the last 190 amino acids from the C terminus, named the repressor domain (18Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). According to this new model, latent RIG-I must undergo a conformational change and self-associate in order to activate IPS-1-mediated response. The present study was conducted to reconcile these independent observations and to establish a link between RNA binding, ATPase activity, and CARD-mediated signal transduction leading to IFN expression. Using enzyme kinetics combined with signal transduction assays, we discovered that the ATPase function of RIG-I is negatively regulated by the CARDs in the absence of RNA, which reveals the pivotal role of the ATPase/helicase domain in the modulation of RIG-I signaling. RNA Methods—Short RNAs were either transcribed from DNA oligonucleotides by using the T7 MEGAshortscript (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer or chemically synthesized (IDT). If used in double-stranded context, synthetic ssRNA (5′-GAGUCACGACGUUGUAAAAAA-3′) was annealed to reverse ssRNA (3′-CUCAGUGCUGCAACAUUUUUU-5′). Triphosphorylated ssRNA was obtained in vitro from the DNA oligonucleotide TR10P1-FOR (5′-AATTTAATACGACTCACTATAGAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAAAA-3′) annealed with the reverse complement strand. Radiolabeling of in vitro transcribed RNA was performed with T4 RNA ligase 1 (New England Biolabs) and [32P]pCp (GE Healthcare), while T4 PNK (Invitrogen) was used for 5′-end labeling of synthetic RNA in the presence of [32P]ATP (GE Healthcare). All enzymes were subsequently heat-inactivated, and radiolabeled material was further purified with G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). The cIRES RNA was synthesized with the T7 Megascript kit (Ambion) as previously described (19Klumpp K. Leveque V. Le Pogam S. Ma H. Jiang W.R. Kang H. Granycome C. Singer M. Laxton C. Hang J.Q.

Chem. 2006; 281: 3793-3799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Poly(U) and poly(I/C) were purchased from GE Healthcare. Protein Expression and Purification—The wild-type cDNA clone encoding human RIG-I (GenBank™ accession number AF038963) was purchased from Origene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD). Full-length and different truncated versions of the gene were subcloned to a modified pET11 vector containing 6 histidine codons in-frame at the 5′-end of the cloning site. K270A and D372A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange II (Stratagene), and sequence changes were controlled on both strands. Recombinant RIG-I was generated in Escherichia coli expression system (BL21DE3), with induction started with 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 25 °C after a 3-h cold shock at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm imidazole), sonicated, and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) with gentle rocking at 4 °C for 1 h before elution on column with a gradient of imidazole up to 500 mm. Full-length RIG-I was further purified with heparin-agarose affinity chromatography (MP Biomedicals, LLC) and finally dialyzed overnight against storage buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 0.13% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA). Protein samples were quantified, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C. ATPase Activity—Unless indicated, all ATPase assays were performed in the helicase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 2 mm ATP, 3 mm MgCl2.We used either the 25 nm RIG-Ih domain or 225 nm full-length RIG-I in a 20-μl reaction at 37 °C for various times, typically ranging from 5 to 90 min. Reaction samples were stopped by rapid dilution (20-fold) in acidic malachite green solution (Bio-Assay Systems) supplemented with 10 mm EDTA and incubated for 15 min, and the absorbance was determined at 650 nm. All kinetic data were analyzed using the software PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc.). At saturating RNA concentrations, activation coefficients were calculated under Michaelis-Menten conditions as follows: Km(R′) = α Km(Ri), and kcat(R′) = β kcat (Ri). RNA Binding—Purified RIG-I or RIG-Ih was incubated at different concentrations with radiolabeled RNA (4 nm) for 15 min at 22 °C in helicase buffer before adding the Novex high density buffer (Invitrogen). Complexes were resolved on a 6% acrylamide Tris borate-EDTA non-denaturing gel (Invitrogen) after a 30-min migration at 22 °C, visualized, and quantified by phosphorimaging. The best fit of titration curves were generated with a cooperative binding model using the following sigmoidal equation, as previously described (20Manelyte L. Urbanke C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Y = Y0+Ymax (Rn/(Rn + K½n)), where Y is the fraction of bound RNA, Y0 is the background signal, Ymax is the maximum fraction of bound RNA, R is the concentration of RIG-I monomer, K½ is the apparent dissociation constant, and N is the Hill coefficient. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with Glutamax™, 100 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. HSG Neo L+I cell line (Apath LLC, St. Louis, MO) are stably transfected with a genotype 1a HCV sub-genomic replicon and are a derivative of the Huh7.5 cell line. The replicon was cured from the HSG Neo L+I cell line, resulting in the cell line HSG7.5. To confirm the presence of the T55I substitution in RIG-I, cDNA was generated from the HSG7.5 cells. The RIG-I coding region was amplified using the following primer pairs, (S)5′-GTCCGGCCTCATTTCCTCGGAAAATC-3′, (AS)5′-GGTACAAGCGATCCATGATTATACCCACTATGTTTG-3′, and sequenced using ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Cell Stimulation Assays—Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of His-tagged wild-type, K270A, or D372A mutant RIG-I (or empty vector as a control) cloned into pDEST26 (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell culture medium was replaced 4 h post-transfection. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were transfected with in vitro transcribed 5′-phosphorylated cIRES RNA or lipid (mock), and 24 h later total cellular RNA was extracted. Total RNA was isolated using versaGene 96 RNA purification kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out in a 10-μl reaction using 2 μl of total cellular RNA (Taqman Reverse transcriptase reagents; Applied Biosystems). To quantitate the level of IFN-β and RIG-I gene expression, 4 μl of cDNA (diluted 1:4 in H2O) was amplified in a 20-μl reaction consisting of Taqman Universal PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) with the following sets of primers and probe (6 μm each) (fluorogenic probe labeled with FAM, IFN-β:5′-CAAGCCTCCCATTCAATTGCCACAG-3′; forward primer, 5′-CAGCAATTTTCAGTGTCAGAAGCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCATCCTGTCCTTGAGGCAGTA-3′; fluorogenic probe labeled with FAM, RPS-9: 5′-ACCCCGCGGAGACCCTTCGA-3′; forward primer, 5′-GAGCTGGGTTTGTCGCAAAA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCTCTTGGTCGAGACGAGATTT-3′) using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The human RIG-I primer and probe set was obtained from Applied Biosystems. Gene expression levels were normalized to endogenous gene RPS-9. Changes in gene expression after transfection with wild-type or mutant RIG-I in the presence of cIRES RNA were expressed as a ratio to the levels observed in vector-only transfected cells, set arbitrarily as 1. The ATPase Activity of Latent RIG-I Is Autoinhibited—We expressed and purified the full-length human RIG-I containing the two CARDs responsible for signal transduction and the helicase/ATPase domain serving as a RNA ligand receptor (Fig. 1A). The ATPase activity of RIG-I was monitored by following the steady-state formation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) over time with increasing concentrations of substrate. The same reaction was also conducted in the presence of RNA mimicking a virus-induced stimulus. The partially double-stranded cIRES sequence was chosen for this purpose because it contains the hairpin loops within the 5′-untranslated region of the HCV genome. Under these conditions, we observed that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the reaction increased from 15.8 to 223 mm-1 min-1 in the presence of cIRES (Fig. 1B). This RNA-induced activation was essentially caused by a 33-fold higher kcat (from 7.6 to 253 min-1) without major changes in ATP binding. We next investigated how various RNA structures can influence the activation state of RIG-I. The basal ATPase activity of RIG-I was also increased in the presence of homopolymeric poly(I/C) but remained unchanged with ssRNA poly(U), suggesting that the ATPase domain is activated after binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or secondary structures of ssRNA in hairpin loops (Fig. 1C). We also assessed the selectivity of NTP usage. In the absence of RNA, RIG-I showed little difference in catalysis between nucleotides (Fig. 1D). In comparison, the nucleoprotein complex had a marked preference for the adenine base, as judged by the 30- and 29-fold increase in catalysis of ATP and dATP, respectively. Together, these results show that purified RIG-I is a functional RNA receptor coupled with an RNA structure-dependent ATPase. In the absence of ligand, the ATPase activity of RIG-I is autoinhibited. Efficiency of RNA Binding Modulates RIG-I Activation—We decided to use short RNA sequences to establish a mechanistic link between ligand binding and ATPase activity. We characterized the RNA binding properties of RIG-I by developing an electromobility shift assay (EMSA). Increasing amounts of protein were incubated with radiolabeled short synthetic RNA for 15 min at room temperature, and the resulting complexes were submitted to a native PAGE. Under these conditions, RIG-I was able to bind to dsRNA (K½ = 26.4 ± 1.3 nm) significantly better than to ssRNA (<50% of input RNA bound at 320 nm RIG-I) (Fig. 2, A and B). The formation of high molecular weight complexes involving more than one protein/molecule of dsRNA was consistent with a cooperative binding model yielding a Hill coefficient n = 3.5. We also evaluated the contribution of the triphosphate moiety to ssRNA binding, as it was recently reported to play an important role in RIG-I activation (1Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzozka K.

Naslund T.I. Liljestrom P. Weber F. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2006; 314: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). A 21-mer oligonucleotide transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase was incubated with the helicase prior to electrophoresis. As a result, the presence of the 5′-triphosphate group on ssRNA increased the stability of the nucleoprotein complex (K½ = 131 ± 17.8 nm, Fig. 2B) as compared with ssRNA. Overall, we discovered that RIG-I displays a selective profile of polynucleotide binding with a preference for RNA over DNA as follows: dsRNA > 3P-ssRNA > ssRNA > ssDNA = dsDNA. This binding property is consistent with the differentiated stimulation profile for each of these short oligonucleotides on ATPase activity, with a maximum increase of ∼40-fold observed with dsRNA (Fig. 2C). It also confirms previous indirect observations suggesting that RIG-I does not functionally interact with DNA (4Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M.

S. A. 2007; 104: 9035-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Truncated RIG-Ih Domain Is Constitutively Activated—We assigned the boundaries of the helicase domain of RIG-I by aligning its amino acid sequence against the one of LGP2 sharing 30% identity (Fig. 3A). The linker region is highly acidic and predicted to be disordered around position 230 (Fig. 3B); it could therefore contribute to the functional integrity of RIG-I and/or the regulation of its signaling. To test these possibilities, we decided to express and purify three constructs of the helicase domain containing different parts of the linker region (Fig. 3C). All three truncated enzymes displayed similar catalytic efficiency between 552 and 861 mm-1 min-1 (Fig. 3D). We concluded that the linker does not regulate the enzymatic function of the helicase domain and decided to use the RIG_239 construct exclusively throughout the rest of this study, referred to as RIG-Ih. We also looked at the effect of RNA on ATPase activity. To our surprise, none of the polynucleotides tested was able to stimulate the activity of the isolated helicase domain (Fig. 4A). To ensure that this defect in regulation was not caused by an impaired RNA binding function, we measured the formation of the nucleoprotein complex by EMSA. The isolated RIG-Ih domain showed the same selective RNA binding properties as the full-length enzyme (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the rates and selectivity profile of nucleotide accommodation in the absence of RNA were similar to the ones of the activated full-length RIG-I (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results provide convincing evidence that the helicase domain is constitutively activated in the absence of the CARDs. ATPase Activity Is Important for cIRES-mediated Activation of IFN-β—Walker A and B motifs in helicases are a signature of nucleotide binding. We decided to investigate by mutagenesis the contribution of each of these conserved sequences to the ATPase activity of RIG-I (Fig. 3A). The resulting proteins containing a mutation in Walker A (K270A) or in Walker B (D372A) could still bind to RNA but displayed reduced enzymatic activity compared with wild-type RIG-I under RNA activation conditions (Fig. 5A). The same results were observed with the truncated proteins (data not shown), which highlights the importance of each of the two conserved residues for ATPase activity. To explore the biological relevance of our findings at the cellular level, we measured IFN-β gene expression in hepatocytes as a surrogate for RIG-I activation. Transfection of cIRES RNA induced a 340-fold increase in IFN-β gene expression in Huh7 cells (Fig. 5B). The specific induction of IFN-β was also confirmed by Taqman analysis of IFN-inducible gene IFI-6 gene expression levels that showed induction only in cells that expressed IFN-β (data not shown). The absence of response to cIRES RNA in Huh7.5-derived cells containing a defective RIG-I (HSG7.5) showed that cIRES is a specific activator of the RIG-I-dependent signaling pathway. We then transfected HSG7.5 cells with wild-type or mutant RIG-I plasmids to allow ectopic expression of recombinant RIG-I (Fig. 5C), followed by cIRES RNA transfection. Under these conditions, wild-type RIG-I restored the response to stimulation with cIRES RNA, resulting in a 43-fold increase in IFN-β gene expression compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5D). In comparison, the K270A and D372A mutations in RIG-I prevented full production of IFN-β and antiviral activation of the cells, although D372A mutant retained partial activity (∼30%). Overall, these results correlate well with the enzymatic phenotype of the mutated purified proteins and show that the ATPase activity of RIG-I is required for the efficient production of IFN under RNA stimulation conditions. The Basal ATPase Activity of RIG-I Is Independent of Magnesium—Most helicases require metal ions to coordinate the β and γ phosphates of ATP before the nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. Nevertheless, there are a few reports of related enzymes with magnesium-independent ATPase activity (21Bartelma G. Padmanabhan R. Virology. 2002; 299: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Frick D.N. Banik S. Rypma R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 1017-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Picha K.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27315-27319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our ATPase reactions were routinely conducted with 3 mm magnesium. This concentration allows RIG-Ih to achieve efficient catalysis whether or not it is bound to RNA (Fig. 6A). However, we discovered that full-length RIG-I does not require magnesium for its basal ATPase activity (Fig. 6B). Instead, the metal ion participates in the nucleophilic attack only in the RNA-stimulated reaction. Consistently, divalent metal ion-chelating agents, such as EDTA, do not alter the basal rate of formation of Pi by RIG-I, which excludes the possibility of contaminating metal ions (Fig. 6C). The reaction is specific to RIG-I as the rate remains sensitive to D372A mutation. This is confirmed by the fact that other agents, such as NaCl, can equally disrupt the basal ATPase activity of RIG-I and RIG-Ih domain (Fig. 6D). We also looked at the effect of pH on catalysis. It has been previously shown with other helicases that acidic conditions decrease the binding affinity of the enzyme to magnesium (24Lam A.M. Rypma R.S. Frick D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4060-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), resulting in a general loss of activity (25Du M.X. Johnson R.B. Sun X.L. Staschke K.A. Colacino J. Wang Q.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 147-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wardell A.D. Errington W. Ciaramella G. Merson J. McGarvey M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the ATPase activity of the isolated RIG-Ih domain was consistently sensitive to low pH in all tested conditions and peaked between pH 7.0 and 7.5 (Fig. 6E). On the other hand, the basal activity of full-length RIG-I was not affected by pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 and only became sensitive to acidic conditions once bound to RNA (Fig. 6F). This suggests that the level of protonation of polar residues from the active site might affect the binding of magnesium to RIG-I, which, in turn, selectively regulates the catalytic rate of the RNA-stimulated reaction but does not participate in the basal ATPase reaction. A likely interpretation of this observation is that RNA binding induces a conformational change of the active site of RIG-I in order to place the catalytic residues in a position similar to the ones of the intrinsically activated helicase domain. We present the first detailed enzymatic characterization of human recombinant RIG-I and show that the CARDs play an essential role in the regulation of the ATPase domain. Both full-length enzyme and the isolated helicase domain are functional proteins that can be purified after being expressed in E. coli. Our experiments using these two forms show that RIG-I prefers ATP over the other ribonucleotides. This selective activity is largely conserved among SF2 helicases (27Tanner N.K. Cordin O. Banroques J. Doere M. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 28Tanner N.K.

Precursor-mRNAs are often extensively edited by specific uridine insertion or deletion that is directed by small guide RNAs (gRNAs). Recently, it has been shown that cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COXIII) mRNAs can be alternatively edited to encode a novel mitochondrial membrane protein composed of a unique hydrophilic N-terminal sequence of unknown function and the C-terminal hydrophobic segment of COXIII. To extend the analysis of alternative editing in Trypanosoma brucei we have constructed libraries with over 1100 full-length mitochondrial cDNAs and the sequences of over 1200 gRNA genes. Using this data, we show that alternative editing of COXIII, ATPase subunit 6 (A6), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 7, 8 and 9 (ND7, 8, 9) mRNAs can produce novel open reading frames (ORFs). Several gRNAs potentially responsible for the alternative editing of these mRNAs were also identified. These findings show that alternative editing of mitochondrial mRNAs is common in T. brucei and expands the diversity of mitochondrial proteins in these organisms."

The T helper (Th)17 subset of cluster-of-differentiation (CD)4 T cells, which is identified by its generation of interleukin (IL) -17, is implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. To elucidate immunosenescent changes in Th17 cell cytokines, splenic CD4 T cells from 22- to 24-month-old (old) mice and 6- to 10-wk-old (young) mice were incubated on anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (anti-T cell antigen receptor) antibodies. After 96 h, T cells of old C57BL/6 and CBA mice generated up to 20-fold more IL-17 and up to 3-fold more IL-6 than those of young mice; T cells of young mice generated up to 5-fold more IL-21 than those of old mice; and no difference was found for IFN-gamma. At 24 h, cytokine mRNA levels paralleled 96 h cytokine concentrations. Naive CD4 T cells from old mice incubated on anti-T cell antigen receptor antibodies with transforming growth factor-beta, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-23 to induce de novo differentiation of Th17 cells had more IL-17 mRNA and produced more IL-17 than those of young mice. BAY11-7082 and the phytochemicals triptolide and butein suppressed nuclear concentrations of nuclear factor-kappaB and secreted levels of IL-17, IL-21, and IFN-gamma in parallel, with greater potency in Th17 cells from young than old mice.

The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a type B retrovirus, is a causative agent of murine mammary carcinomas and is also associated with T-cell lymphomas (17Michalides R. Wagenaar E. Hilkens J.

The Env signal sequence is predicted to comprise 98 amino acid residues and includes a consensus sequence for a nuclear localization signal (NLS, Fig. 1A) in its extended n-region (21Hoch-Marchaim H.

The translation product, named regulator of export/expression of MMTV mRNA (Rem), shares identity with Env in the predicted signal sequence, as well as the N-terminal 162 and the C-terminal 41 amino acid residues of Env (Fig. 1A) (22Indik S.

Rem and an experimentally truncated version of Rem identical to the signal sequence were shown to function as nuclear export factors for intron-containing transcripts. This activity requires the NLS within the nuclear export factor and the presence of the 3′ long terminal repeat as cis-regulatory sequence in the transcript, suggesting that the export of env transcripts is Rem-dependent (23Mertz J.A.

Beyond Env and Rem, a 14-kDa nucleolar protein named p14 was detected in MMTV bearing S49 and EL-4 T-cell lymphomas using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the predicted signal sequence. Protein purification, mass spectrometry, and microsequencing revealed a mass of 11 kDa and sequence identity to, at least, the N-terminal 81 residues of the Rem/Env signal sequence, including the NLS. The mass of 11 kDa is fully consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the 98 amino acids, which are predicted for the entire signal sequence (21Hoch-Marchaim H. Weiss A.M. Bar-Sinai A.

Thus, Rem as well as p14 were detected in the nucleus. However, Rem contains a signal sequence, which suggests ER targeting and translocation of this molecule. Beyond that, the biogenesis of p14 is not known. Therefore, we wanted to investigate how Rem and p14 are generated, if they are processed, and how their localization within the cell is achieved. We have analyzed HeLa cells transiently expressing Rem and found the C-terminal portion of Rem as a glycosylated protein (gp32Rem), whereas the cleaved signal peptide of Rem, here named SPRem, accumulated in nucleoli. Furthermore, we show in a cell-free in vitro system that SPRem is generated at and released from microsomal membranes independent of a processing by the intramembrane protease SPP.

Unreacted groups were protected by treatment with 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Blocking and incubations with antibodies were done for 1 h at room temperature with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS and with 5% fetal calf serum, respectively. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol containing 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

Immunodetection was done with BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (POD, Roche Applied Science). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—42 h post-transfection, cells were depleted of methionine and cysteine for 2 h (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without l-methionine and l-cysteine, containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum dialyzed against PBS to remove small molecules up to 12 kDa). Labeling was done with 75 μCi/ml Redivue Pro-mix l-35S cell labeling mix (GE Healthcare) for various periods of time as detailed in the figure legends. For the analysis of the glycosylation pattern, cells were lysed in SDS-containing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate; 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 0.1% (w/v) SDS; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 10 μg/ml chymostatin; 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was spun through a QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the protocol of the manufacturer and, additionally, cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were diluted with IP buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and antibodies were added. Samples were rotated for 3 h, and the beads were washed four times with IP buffer. Endoglycosidase H treatment was done as suggested by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). For fractionation, cells were first permeabilized for 5 min with 0.02% digitonin (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 0.02% (w/v) digitonin; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 10 μg/ml chymostatin; 10 μg/ml pepstatin) to release cytosolic proteins. The permeabilized cells were pelleted (5 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C) and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 10% (v/v) glycerol; 1% (v/v) Triton X-100; 1 mm EGTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 10 μg/ml chymostatin; 10 μg/ml pepstatin) to solubilize membrane proteins. Nonsoluble material was pelleted as detailed above, and the pellet was resuspended in SDS-containing lysis buffer. This lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20 min, 16.000 × g, 4 °C). Following immunoprecipitation, proteins were separated on a Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE as described above. Dried gels were analyzed by PhosphorImaging (Bio-Rad PMI system for Fig. 2B, Fuji BAS 1500 for every other autoradiogram). To control the fractionation, nontransfected cells or cells expressing EGFP were lysed as described, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometric and Statistical Analyses—Densitometric analysis was done with ImageJ. Each signal, represented by a defined area, was corrected for background by subtracting a signal from an identical area within the same lane. For statistical analyses, relative amounts were calculated, i.e. signals from each time point were adjusted to 100%. Relative amounts are given in percent with standard deviation. Statistical analysis was done with JMP (SAS Institute). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and Student's t tests for unpaired groups. p values are given in the legend. In Vitro Translation/Translocation Assay—Rem encoding plasmid DNA was linearized, purified, and used for in vitro transcription with SP6 polymerase as described before (11Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transcripts were treated with DNase (Promega) and purified using G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). In vitro translation was done for 30 min at 30 °C in 10-μl reactions using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), Redivue Pro-mix l-35S cell labeling mix (GE Healthcare), and 1–1.5 eq canine pancreas rough microsomes produced according to the protocol from Walter and Blobel (30Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Signal peptide peptidase inhibitor (Z-LL)2-ketone (Calbiochem) was dissolved in Me2SO and added as indicated. In vitro reactions were precipitated with ammonium sulfate by adding 2 volumes of saturated ammonium sulfate solution and precipitation for 20 min on ice. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in distilled H2O. Proteins were again precipitated with 2 volumes of ice-cold absolute ethanol, pelleted, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer (50 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8; 10 mm EDTA; 5% glycerol; 2% SDS; 0.01% bromphenol blue). To separate the microsomes from the supernatant, in vitro reaction samples were layered on top of a 50-μl cushion (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6; 750 mm KOAc; 10 mm Mg(OAc)2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 500 mm sucrose), and membranes were pelleted by 5 min of centrifugation at 100,000 × g and at 4 °C (Beckman TLA 100 rotor or Sorvall S100-AT3 rotor). For SDS-gel electrophoresis, the supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described above, and the pellet was directly resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated in 10–17% gradient gels (T, 30%; C, 2.6%) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was diluted with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, whereas the pellet was directly resuspended in this lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was done as described above. For the characterization of the release, in vitro translation was carried out as described above but stopped after 15 min by the addition of 1.25 mm cycloheximide (Sigma). Signal peptide release was analyzed for various periods of time as well as under different temperature conditions (either on ice or at 30 °C). The samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. Cellular Localization of the Rem N- and C-terminal Portions—In previous studies, a Rem-EGFP fusion protein was used for localization, and a nucleolar EGFP staining was detected (22Indik S. Gunzburg W.H. Salmons B. Rouault F. Virology. 2005; 337: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Mertz J.A. Simper M.S. Lozano M.M. Payne S.M. Dudley J.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14737-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine the localization of both the N- and C-terminal portions of Rem by immunofluorescence microscopy. To this end, we transiently expressed C-terminally Myc-tagged Rem (Rem-myc) in HeLa cells and stained with the monoclonal antibody M66, which recognizes an epitope in the predicted signal sequence (21Hoch-Marchaim H. Weiss A.M. Bar-Sinai A. Fromer M. Adermann K. Hochman J. Virology. 2003; 313: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Hoch-Marchaim H. Hasson T. Rorman E. Cohen S. Hochman J. Virology. 1998; 242: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), that is the N-terminal portion, as well as an antibody recognizing the C-terminal Myc tag (Fig. 1B). The M66 antibody detected its epitope mainly in the nucleus, where a major fraction co-localized with the nucleolar marker B23 (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The C-terminal Myc tag of Rem-myc was detected in a reticular structure, which was also stained by an antibody against Sec61β, an ER marker. Additionally, nucleolar staining was obtained with the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Thus, the localization of the N- and C-terminal portions of Rem-myc in nucleoli indicates that full-length Rem-myc is imported into the nucleus. However, Rem-myc is not exclusively a nuclear protein, because the C-terminal portion can also be found at the ER. Next, we analyzed whether the predicted signal sequence of Rem/Env is able to direct an unrelated, otherwise cytosolic protein to the ER. To this end, we fused the N-terminal 101 amino acids of Rem/Env (including the 98-amino acid-long predicted signal sequence) to EGFP with a C-terminal KDEL motif. The KDEL motif retains translocated EGFP in the ER, where it can be detected. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with this construct named SPRem-EGFP-KDEL. By immunofluorescence microscopy, EGFP staining was observed primarily in a reticular structure typical for the ER, but it was also found in nucleoli (Fig. 1C). The M66 epitope was again detected in the nucleus, mainly in nucleoli. Thus, the Rem/Env-derived signal sequence can target EGFP-KDEL to the ER. As a consequence of targeting, the signal sequence may be cleaved, and nucleolar M66 staining may in part be due to the presence of cleaved signal sequences. The EGFP staining found in nucleoli along with the nucleolar M66 staining again suggests that a certain amount of the precursor molecules was transported to the nucleus. Biochemical Identification of Rem and Its Derivatives—Next, we wanted to biochemically identify the antigens detected by the M66, anti-Myc, and anti-GFP antibody. We transfected HeLa cells with Rem-myc or SPRem-EGFP-KDEL and analyzed cell lysates by immunoblotting. In both cases, the M66 antibody detected a 14-kDa protein, termed p14 (Fig. 2A, p14, lanes 2 and 4). The signal sequence is the only common sequence of the proteins expressed from these two constructs, which strongly suggests that p14 is the cleaved signal sequence of Rem. Besides p14, the M66 antibody detected a 42-kDa protein in cells expressing SPRem-EGFP-KDEL (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and a low amount of a 38-kDa protein in cells expressing Rem-myc, respectively (lane 2). To identify the C-terminal portion, Rem-myc expressing cells were analyzed with the anti-Myc antibody. We detected a 38- and a 33-kDa protein (Rem-myc and p33Rem-myc, Fig. 2A, lane 7). Thus, the 38-kDa protein detected by both antibodies represents the precursor Rem-myc. Because the 33-kDa protein was not detected by the M66 antibody, it does not contain the signal sequence and represents the signal sequence-cleaved protein p33Rem-myc. Similarly, in cells expressing SPRem-EGFP-KDEL, the anti-GFP antibody detected a signal sequence-cleaved EGFP-KDEL protein (28 kDa) as well as the precursor protein (SPRem-EGFP-KDEL, 42 kDa), which was also detected with the M66 antibody (lane 9). In summary, precursor molecules as well as mature proteins along with cleaved signal sequences can be detected in cells overexpressing Rem-myc or SPRem-EGFP-KDEL. Consistent with ER targeting and signal sequence cleavage, the C-terminal portion of Rem-myc (p33Rem-myc) is most likely translocated across the ER membrane. Because Rem contains two putative N-glycosylation sites (compare Fig. 1A), we investigated whether p33Rem-myc is a glycoprotein. To this end, we expressed Rem-myc in HeLa cells, metabolically labeled the cells, and analyzed lysates by immunoprecipitation and treatment with endoglycosidase H, which removes N-linked sugar moieties. A 38-kDa protein representing Rem-myc was detected independent of endoglycosidase H treatment. The 33-kDa protein detected in Rem-myc expressing cells was reduced to 27 kDa (p27Rem-myc) by treatment with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 2B). This indicates two glycosylation events, which alter the molecular mass by about 2–3 kDa each. In an independent experiment, we found a similar reduction in molecular mass by 5–6 kDa when analyzing cells treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation (data not shown). Thus, p33Rem-myc (in Fig. 2A) is a glycoprotein, which confirms its translocation into the ER lumen. We named this protein gp33Rem-myc in contrast to the precursor that was previously named Rem or, in our case, Rem-myc. Next, we wanted to determine whether the cleave"
https://openalex.org/W2073757604,"Mutations in the Hedgehog signaling pathway is responsible for the formation of various cancers, including some forms of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Uncontrolled Hedgehog signaling leads to overexpression of the zinc-finger Gli transcription factors, among which Gli2 plays a central role. We found that high Gli2 expression induced the concomitant high expression of the caspase 8 inhibitor, cFlip, and thereby counteracts death-ligand-mediated apoptosis. By investigating the cFlip promoter, Gli2 binding sites were identified and confirmed. Gli2 gene silencing by RNA interference broke the apoptosis resistance via cFlip downregulation. The direct functional connection between Gli2 and cFlip was not only demonstrated in a keratinocytic cell line but also in BCC tissue. As cFlip and Bcl-2 are highly expressed in BCCs, as a consequence of high Gli2 expression, this may explain the marked resistance of the tumor to the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway. We could now demonstrate that Gli2 gene silencing in BCC tissues made the tumor sensitive to TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-mediated cell death by downregulating cFlip. As Gli2 silencing does not only downregulate cFlip, but also Bcl-2, Gli2 could be a key target for a novel therapeutic approach in tumors with dysregulated Hedgehog signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1982913199,"The function of tissue factor (Tf)-initiated coagulation is hemorrhage control through the formation and maintenance of an impermeable platelet-fibrin barrier. The catalytic processes involved in the clot maintenance function are not well defined, although the rebleeding problems characteristic of individuals with hemophilias A and B suggest a link between specific defects in the Tf-initiated process and defects in the maintenance function. We have previously demonstrated, using a methodology of “flow replacement” (or resupply) of ongoing Tf-initiated reactions with fresh reactants, that procoagulant complexes are produced during Tf-initiated coagulation, which are capable of reinitiating coagulation without input from extrinsic factor Xase activity (Orfeo, T., Butenas, S., Brummel-Ziedins, K. E., and Mann, K. G. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 42887–42896). Here we used Tf-initiated reactions in normal and hemophilia blood or in their corresponding proteome mixtures as sources of procoagulant end products and then varied the resupplying material to determine the identity of the catalysts that drive the new cycle of thrombin formation. The central findings are as follows: 1) the prothrombinase complex (fVa-fXa-Ca2+-membrane) accumulated during the episode of Tf-initiated coagulation is the primary catalyst responsible for the observed pattern of prothrombin activation after resupply; 2) impairments in intrinsic factor Xase function, i.e. hemophilias A and B, result in an impaired capacity to mount a resupply response; and 3) in normal hemostasis the intrinsic factor Xase function contributes to the durability of the resupply response.

In closed model systems used to study blood coagulation, this pathway is characterized by the successive emergence and overlapping expression of three procoagulant complexes. The first complex forms when pre-existent factor (f) VIIa binds to the membrane-bound protein Tf, forming the extrinsic fXase complex (Tf-fVIIa-Ca2+-membrane). Formation of the extrinsic fXase yields an ∼107-fold increase in enzymatic activity of fVIIa toward its substrates, fIX and fX (1Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). fXa produced by the extrinsic fXase directly activates amounts of prothrombin (fII) to thrombin (2Orfeo T. Brufatto N.

These events establish the reaction conditions necessary for the emergence of the two catalytic complexes required for the amplified rates of thrombin formation that characterize an effective hemostatic response: the intrinsic fXase complex (fVIIIa-fIXa-Ca2+-membrane), a catalyst that is ∼50 times more efficient in converting fX to fXa than the extrinsic fXase (4Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1992; 18: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar); and the prothrombinase complex (fVa-fXa-Ca2+-membrane), a catalyst of fII activation that is ∼105-fold more efficient than fXa (6Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Over the course of the reaction, the intrinsic fXase produces the vast majority of the fXa found in the prothrombinase complex (7Hockin M.F. Jones K.C. Everse S.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18322-18333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), whereas thrombin generated by the prothrombinase complex drives most of the platelet activation and fibrin formation. The interplay between the extrinsic and intrinsic fXase functions is highlighted in hemophilias A (fVIII deficiency) and B (fIX deficiency), life-threatening hemorrhagic disorders in which fXa generation, and thus ultimately prothrombinase levels, depend on the less efficient extrinsic fXase complex. Consequences of this reliance on the extrinsic fXase observed using in vitro models of hemophilia include impaired rates and maximum levels of thrombin formation (8Cawthern K.M. van't Veer C.

Although there is good consensus on the requirement for Tf in the initiation of coagulation and on the primary catalytic complexes that emerge in response to Tf, there is less agreement on the overall mechanism by which Tf functions in vivo. In one view of normal hemostasis, Tf is sequestered outside of blood vessels (12Drake T.A. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 1087-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilcox J.N.

If a sufficient Tf challenge is presented, a full coagulant response follows; if the Tf challenge is insufficient, the procoagulant response is arrested, primarily by the activity of the stoichiometric inhibitor Tf pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (18van't Veer C.

Contributing to this conceptual framework are several lines of evidence. 1) Reports from our laboratory and others have indicated that there is little or no Tf-related activity in the blood of healthy individuals (19Butenas S.

Blood. 2005; 105: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). 3) In several in vitro models of Tf-initiated coagulation, the procoagulant response becomes independent of Tf cofactor activity prior to the onset of clot formation (23Orfeo T.

Collectively, these data have been rationalized by advancing a competing hypothesis of overall Tf biology in which the initiating Tf stimulus requires constant supplementation of the ongoing reaction with newly arrived Tf. This hypothesis depends on three interdependent concepts. 1) The developing platelet/fibrin plug isolates the procoagulant complexes initially formed at the site of vascular injury from further supply of fresh reactants, thus eliminating participation of the triggering Tf supply as the reaction proceeds (47Hathcock J.J. Nemerson Y. Blood. 2004; 104: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 2) Tf is present in blood at levels below the threshold to support a coagulant response (48Jesty J. Beltrami E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2463-2469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or in some cryptic state, but it accumulates to an effective level on the vascular face of a forming thrombus (39Chou J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42887-42896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) in which two procoagulant compartments emerge as a consequence of the impermeable barrier formed by platelets and fibrin as follows: an extravascular one, isolated from the blood, with quiescent (reactant-starved) procoagulant catalysts that can respond immediately if the barrier fails; and a vascular side where the accumulated ensemble of procoagulant catalysts, exposed to flowing blood, continues the process of clot growth. On this side, however, these catalysts are exposed to the active anticoagulant properties of the vasculature that eventually neutralize them, rendering the vascular face of the clot inert. Thus, in this model, hemorrhage control involves not only the formation of an effective barrier and appropriate control of clot growth on the vascular side but also involves the presence of a persisting, Tf-independent procoagulant potential on the extravascular side. Potential candidates for this procoagulant aftermath include clot-bound thrombin (24Francis C.W. Markham Jr., R.E. Barlow G.H. Florack T.M. Dobrzynski D.M. Marder V.J. J. Lab. Clin.

This construct led us to suggest that the tendency of hemophiliacs to bleed in part reflected the failure to sufficiently populate the extravascular compartment of the formed clot with these procoagulant catalysts. Here we report studies in closed model systems of normal and hemophilia coagulation that define the key components that constitute the reservoir of procoagulant activity remaining after an episode of Tf-initiated coagulation.

Healthy control individuals and one hemophilia A individual were recruited and advised according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Vermont Human Studies Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from all individuals. The healthy individuals selected exhibited normal values for the parameters of blood coagulation, protein levels, and platelet counts. The hemophilia A donor was a young man, 27 years old, who has functionally severe fVIII deficiency (fVIII:C < 1%). He tested positive for hepatitis C and has a history of bleeding and joint pain and routinely self-administered recombinant fVIII products when symptomatic. His blood was drawn 5 days after the most recent fVIII injection. His fVIII level on the day of the experiment was 1%. Blood was drawn by venipuncture and immediately delivered into reagent-loaded tubes. The equivalent of acquired hemophilia B was induced by including the inhibitory monoclonal antibody α-fIX-91 in the tubes as described previously (10Butenas S. Brummel K.E. Branda R.F. Paradis S.G.

Biol. 2003; 23: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At 50 μg/ml, α-fIX-91 prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time of normal plasma from 38 to 115 s. The activated partial thromboplastin time for commercial factor IX-deficient plasma (<1% of factor IX; George King Biomedical, Overland Park, KS) was 112 s. In general, 2 sets of aliquots of CTI-treated blood were initiated with 5 pm Tf reagent. One set was quenched at 1-min intervals, whereas the other was incubated for 20 min. At 20 min this set of unquenched aliquots, which in CTI-blood all showed visible clots at ∼4 min, was resupplied with an equal volume of freshly drawn blood containing CTI alone (0.1 mg/ml) or in “acquired hemophilia B” experiments with CTI (0.1 mg/ml) + α-fIX-91 (0.1 mg/ml) or CTI (0.1 mg/ml) + 320 nm C921-78. Alternatively, resupply experiments were conducted with the addition of an equal volume of a solution containing CTI (0.1 mg/ml), AT (3.4 μm), and fII (1.4 μm) (fII/AT/CTI) in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl at pH 7.4 (HBS) + 2 mm CaCl2 ± α-fIX-91 (0.1 mg/ml). Resupplied tubes were then successively quenched at 1-min intervals. TAT levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) levels as described previously (59Brummel K.E. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2007022455,"2C4 (Pertuzumab, Omnitarg) is a monoclonal antibody targeting p185(her2/neu), which is overexpressed in 30% of invasive breast cancer. 2C4 is currently in phase II clinical trials for several types of cancers. This antibody has been reported to disrupt the association between p185(her2/neu) and ErbB3. In our studies of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-p185(her2/neu) heterodimerization, we noted that 2C4 formed associations with the EGFR-p185(her2/neu) receptor complex. Our data argue against 2C4 as a universal heterodimerization blocker for p185(her2/neu), but indicate that cocktails of monoclonal antibodies binding distinct interaction surfaces of p185(her2/neu) will emerge as the most potent targeted therapy."

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). σE is a sigma factor dedicated to the transcription of genes that encode proteases, chaperones, and folding catalysts in the cell envelop, and it is activated by a cascade of intracellular proteolysis of its inhibitor (16Ades S.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Alba B.M. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions, σE is kept inactive through its tight association with the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the membrane-bound anti-σE protein, RseA, which has a type II (NIN-COUT) topology. When cells are exposed to extracytoplasmic stresses, stress signals such as unassembled outer membrane proteins directly activate DegS, a membrane protease with a periplasmic active site (18Walsh N.P. Alba B.M. Bose B. Gross C.A. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 113: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), to cleave RseA on the periplasmic side (site-1 cleavage). This first proteolysis triggers the second (site-2) cleavage of RseA by RseP within its transmembrane region (RseA TM), leading to the liberation of a complex between the RseA cytoplasmic domain and σE (14Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A.

Finally, the RseA cytoplasmic domain is degraded by cytoplasmic proteases, allowing σE to transcribe the target genes (20Flynn J.M. Levchenko I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2292-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Chaba R. Grigorova I.L. Flynn J.M. Baker T.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). RseP can only act on RseA after the site-1 cleavage by the activated DegS. The inability of RseP to act against full-length RseA ensures that the activation of σE is strictly stress-dependent (14Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Alba B.M. Leeds J.A. Onufryk C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2156-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that factors including the PDZ domain of the RseP periplasmic region, the glutaminerich regions in the RseA periplasmic region, DegS, and periplasmic protein RseB, contribute to the suppression of proteolysis of full-length RseA by RseP (22Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Grigorova I.L. Chaba R. Zhong H.J. Alba B.M. Rhodius V. Herman C. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2686-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Bohn C. Collier J. Bouloc P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, its exact mechanism remains unclear. Although the essential cellular function of RseP lies in the activation of σE through the cleavage of RseA, model experiments showed that RseP has an unexpectedly wide substrate specificity, by which it can cleave several unrelated transmembrane sequences, including the first and the fifth transmembrane sequences of lactose permease (LacY) (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Systematic mutational analysis showed that cleavage of a model substrate having the first transmembrane segment of LacY (LacYTM1) is promoted by helix-destabilizing residues in the LacYTM1 sequence (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The RseP cleavage sites have been determined to lie within the predicted membrane-embedded regions of RseA TM and LacYTM1 (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that I-CLiPs catalyze proteolysis within the lipid bilayer, raising a question of how water molecules required for hydrolysis of a peptide bond are supplied to the proteolytic active site in the membrane. We analyzed the environment of the RseP active site based on the accessibility of various thiol-alkylating reagents to the Cys residues introduced around the catalytic residues of RseP (25Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4553-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that the active site of RseP is neither totally embedded in the lipid phase nor exposed to the cytoplasm, but rather it is located within a folded protein domain partially embedded in the membrane. This is in sharp contrast to the cases of GlpG, an E. coli rhomboid homolog, and γ-secretase; biochemical, and structural studies have shown that the active sites of these enzymes are open to the extramembrane milieus and freely accessible to water (26Sato C. Morohashi Y. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12081-12088Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Tolia A. Chavez-Gutierrez L. De Strooper B. J. Biol.

It is currently unclear how the substrates and water molecules are presented to the sequestered actives site of RseP. Despite their biological importance, the action mechanisms of I-CLiPs remain largely elusive. In the present study, we biochemically analyzed the interaction between RseP and model substrates. Our results demonstrate the importance of the helix-destabilizing resides of a substrate transmembrane segment in its stable association with RseP and the involvement of the third transmembrane region of RseP in substrate binding. These results provide basic information useful to elucidate the molecular mechanism of proteolysis catalyzed by RseP and the S2P family proteases. Bacterial Strains and Media—We used E. coli K12 strains that are derivatives of AD16 (Δpro-lac thi/F′lacIq ZΔM15 Y+ pro+) (30Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3351-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). KK211 (AD16, rseA::cat, rseP::kan), AD1840 (AD16, rseA::cat, rseP::kan, degS::tet) (14Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and KK31 (AD16, rseP::kan, Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10/pKK6 (Para-rseP)) (13Kanehara K. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were described previously. L broth (31Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics: A Manual for Genetic Engineering. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) and M9 medium (32Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) were used as nutrients and minimal media, respectively. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), and/or spectinomycin (50 μg/ml) were added for selection of transformants as well as for growing plasmid-bearing strains. Plasmids—The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Plasmids encoding derivatives of HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 having the M1, M6, and M12 mutant forms of the LacYTM1 sequence were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (33Sawano A. Miyawaki A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E78Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) of pSTD835. pSTD1014 was constructed by cloning a SacI-HindIII fragment of pKK50 (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) into the same sites of pST689 (22Kanehara K. Ito K. Akiyama Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6389-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Plasmids for single Cys, H22F, and E23S derivatives of RseP(Cys-less)-His6-Myc were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pSTD892 (25Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4553-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Plasmids coding for the RseP-His6-Myc derivatives with a replacement of Asn-389 by other residues were also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pSTD892 and pKD157. pKD99 (HA-RseA140) was constructed by ligating an EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pKK58 (HA-RseA140) (13Kanehara K. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with pSTD689 that had been digested with the same enzymes. For construction of pKD126 encoding a Cys-less derivative of HA-RseA140, the codon for the unique Cys residue in RseA (Cys-109) was changed to the codon for Ala by site-directed mutagenesis of pKD99. Plasmids for single Cys derivatives of HA-RseA140 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pKD126. The DNA sequences of the mutated genes were confirmed by sequencing.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidEncoded proteinReferencespTWV228VectorTakara ShuzopTYE007Vector(45Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T.

The transformants were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 20 amino acids (20 μg/ml each), thiamine (2 μg/ml), glucose (0.4%), and IPTG (1 mm) at 30 °C for 3 h. For assays of the cleavage of the HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 derivatives by chromosomal RseP, cells of AD1811 (ΔrseA) and KK211 (ΔrseA ΔrseP) were transformed with a plasmid encoding a derivative of HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140. Cells were grown in L broth containing IPTG (1 mm) at 30 °C for 3 h. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-Myc and/or anti-HA antibodies as described previously (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Cells of KK211 (ΔrseA ΔrseP) carrying an appropriate combination of plasmids encoding derivatives of RseP-His6-Myc and HA-MBP-RseA140 were grown at 30 °C for 3.5 h in L medium containing 1 mm IPTG and 1mm cAMP. Cells were harvested, suspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), and disrupted by sonication. Next, total membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation, suspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5)/50 mm KCl/20% glycerol), and treated with 0 or 0.2 mg/ml DSP, a cleavable, homobifunctional cross-linker, at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were then incubated with 500 mm ammonium acetate at 4 °C for 10 min to quench DSP, diluted 10-fold with buffer B (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5)/300 mm KCl/10% glycerol), and solubilized with 1% DDM on ice for 1 h. After clarification by ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-HA (F-7) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C for 3.5 h with rotation. Immunocomplexes were collected, washed three times with buffer C (Buffer B plus 0.1% DDM), and dissolved in SDS sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA. Disulfide Cross-linking—Cells of AD1840 (ΔrseA, ΔrseP, and ΔdegS) containing an appropriate combination of plasmids encoding derivatives of RseP-His6-Myc and HA-RseA140 were grown at 30 °C in L medium containing 1 mm IPTG and 1 mm cAMP for 3.5 h. Then, a portion of the culture was removed and mixed with chloramphenicol (200 μg/ml) and 3 mm 2-phenanthroline. Cells were harvested, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing 3 mm 2-phenanthroline, and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). They were treated with 1 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 or 3 mm 2-phenanthroline at 37 °C for 5 min. The oxidation reaction was terminated by incubation with 12.5 mm neocuproine for 5 min at 37 °C. Proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and dissolved in buffer containing 1.5% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide at room temperature for 30 min. N-Ethylmaleimide was included to prevent formation of disulfide bonds after protein denaturation. A portion of each sample was mixed with an equal volume of 1× SDS sample buffer containing no reducing reagent and further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. For cleavage of disulfide bonds, another portion of each sample was mixed with 1× SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and anti-Myc and anti-HA immunoblotting. Helix-destabilizing Residues Are Required for a Substrate Transmembrane Segment to Be Stably Bound by RseP—A model substrate, HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140, which is composed of a cytoplasmic, HA-tagged MBP domain, LacYTM1, and a short periplasmic region derived from RseA (Fig. 1), mimics the DegS-cleaved intermediate form of RseA and receives DegS-independent cleavage within the LacYTM1 sequence by RseP (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). When HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 was expressed in the ΔrseP strain, it accumulated as the full-length form (uncleaved, UC), as revealed by anti-HA immunoblotting. In the presence of the chromosomally encoded RseP, it was converted to a cleaved form (CL) (Fig. 2A and B, WT). We previously showed that helix-destabilizing residues in the LacYTM1 sequence promoted its proteolytic cleavage by RseP (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Residues Leu, Ala, Gly, Tyr, Asn, and Pro have been aligned in this order according to their helix-forming to helix-destabilizing propensities in a membrane-mimicking environment (34Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As previously reported (19Akiyama Y. Kanehara K. Ito K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4434-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), replacement of Pro, a strong helix breaker, at position 28 by helix-forming Leu severely impaired the cleavage (Fig. 2, A and B, M1). Also, simultaneous replacement of Gly-13, Gly-25, and Ala-26 by Leu significantly decreased the cleavage efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B, M6), but an additional introduction of Asn at the position of Tyr-19 partially restored the cleavage efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B, M12).FIGURE 2Interaction between RseP and HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 is enhanced by helix-destabilizing resides in LacYTM1. A, amino acid sequences of the derivatives of HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140. The substituted resides are highlighted in bold. The arrow indicates the RseP cleavage site. The amino acid residues are numbered according to the numbering of the original LacY protein. B, the in vivo cleavage of the HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 derivatives by RseP. Plasmids pSTD835 (WT), pSTD840 (M1), pSTD836 (M6), and pSTD872 (M12) were introduced into a ΔrseA strain (AD1811; rseP+) and a ΔrseA ΔrseP strain (KK211; ΔrseP). Plasmid-bearing cells were grown in L broth containing 1 mm IPTG and 1 mm cAMP at 30 °C. Proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and anti-HA immunoblotting. UC and CL indicate the uncleaved and cleaved forms of model substrates, respectively. C, cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation of RseP and the HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 derivatives. Plasmids pSTD835 (WT), pSTD840 (M1), pSTD836 (M6), pSTD872 (M12), and pTWV228 (vector) were introduced into strain AD1840 (ΔrseA ΔrseP ΔdegS)/pSTD1014 (RseP(H22F)-His6-Myc). Plasmid pSTD835 was also introduced into AD1840/pSTD689 (vector). Membrane vesicles carrying the indicated combinations of RseP(H22F)-His6-Myc and the derivatives of HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 were prepared from cells following sonic disruption and were treated with or without DSP. Membrane proteins were solubilized with 1% DDM and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with mouse monoclonal anti-HA beads. Solubilized total membrane proteins (upper two panels) and immunoprecipitates (lower two panels) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and anti-HA or anti-Myc Western blotting (WB) as indicated. Filled and open arrowheads indicate the derivatives of HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 and RseP(H22F)-His6-Myc, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On the basis of these observations, we investigated possible roles of helix-destabilizing residues in the substrate-enzyme interaction. A C-terminally His6-Myc-tagged RseP (RseP-His6-Myc) was co-expressed with the wild-type or mutant forms of the model substrates in the ΔrseP ΔdegS strain. The RseP derivatives used in this experiment and in the following pulldown and cross-linking experiments contained an amino acid alteration (H22F or E23S) in the protease active site motif (HEXXH) to prevent degradation of substrate proteins. Membranes were prepared, treated with or without a membrane-permeable cross-linker, DSP, and solubilized with DDM. Samples were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA beads. The solubilized membrane proteins and the anti-HA precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-Myc (Fig. 2C). Accumulation levels of the RseP derivatives as well as the model substrates were similar among samples from cells expressing their different combinations (Fig. 2C, upper two panels). Also, anti-HA beads precipitated similar amounts of the model substrates from these samples (Fig. 2C, third panel). RseP(H22F)-His6-Myc was co-isolated with the substrate protein by anti-HA immunoprecipitation without prior treatment with DSP (Fig. 2C, lane 1). The precipitation of RseP-His6-Myc with the anti-HA beads depended on the co-expression of the substrate (Fig. 2C, lane 9), indicating that the recovery of RseP was mediated by the substrate. Smaller amounts of RseP-His6-Myc were pulled down with the M1, M6, and M12 mutants (Fig. 2C, lanes 3, 5, and 7). The efficiencies of RseP co-isolation roughly correlated with the efficiencies of their wild-type RseP-dependent cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained when samples were pretreated with DSP (Fig. 2C, even-numbered lanes). These results suggest that the helix destabilization of the substrate transmembrane segment is required for the stable formation of the substrate-enzyme complex. Asn-389 Is Important for the Enzyme-Substrate Interaction—The region of RseP responsible for recognition and binding of a substrate had not been identified. Therefore, we next addressed this issue. We previously constructed a series of RseP-His6-Myc derivatives that contain a single engineered Cys residue in the first (TM1) and third (TM3) transmembrane regions (25Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4553-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Complementation tests indicated that the N389C substitution in TM3 impaired the functionality along with the mutations at the protease active site motif (HEXXH and LDG) residues (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1) (25Koide K. Maegawa S. Ito K. Akiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4553-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We then characterized the N389C mutant of RseP in greater details and found that RseP(N389C)-His6-Myc had decreased proteolytic activity in accordance with the loss of complementation activity (Fig. 3). HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140 accumulated as the full-length protein (UC) when expressed in the ΔrseP strain (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). When wild-type RseP-His6-Myc or Cys-less RseP-His6-Myc was co-expressed with HA-MBP-RseA(LacYTM1)140, most of the substrate protein was cleaved (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3, band CL). Co-expression of RseP(N389C)-His6-Myc resulted in markedly reduced efficiency of the cleavage (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Similar results were obtained with HA-MBP-RseA140, another model substrate containing RseA TM instead"
https://openalex.org/W2071238927,"Background Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) is one of the leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® consists of an equal mixture of recombinant AMA1 from FVO and 3D7 clones of P. falciparum, adsorbed onto Alhydrogel®. A Phase 1 study in semi-immune adults in Mali showed that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic, with higher antibody responses in those who received the 80 µg dose. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in young children in a malaria endemic area. Design This was a Phase 1 dose escalating study in 36 healthy children aged 2–3 years started in March 2006 in Donéguébougou, Mali. Eighteen children in the first cohort were randomized 2∶1 to receive either 20 µg AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® or Haemophilus influenzae type b Hiberix® vaccine. Two weeks later 18 children in the second cohort were randomized 2∶1 to receive either 80 µg AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® or Haemophilus influenzae type b Hiberix® vaccine. Vaccinations were administered on Days 0 and 28 and participants were examined on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 after vaccination and then about every two months. Results to Day 154 are reported in this manuscript. Results Of 36 volunteers enrolled, 33 received both vaccinations. There were 9 adverse events related to the vaccination in subjects who received AMA1-C1 vaccine and 7 in those who received Hiberix®. All were mild to moderate. No vaccine-related serious or grade 3 adverse events were observed. There was no increase in adverse events with increasing dose of vaccine or number of immunizations. In subjects who received the test vaccine, antibodies to AMA1 increased on Day 14 and peaked at Day 42, with changes from baseline significantly different from subjects who received control vaccine. Conclusion AMA-C1 vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic in children in this endemic area although the antibody response was short lived. Trial Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00341250"
https://openalex.org/W2051499339,"Methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP2) processes N-terminal methionine from nascent cellular proteins. Inhibition of MetAP2 has been shown to block angiogenesis and suppress tumor growth in preclinical tumor models. However, the biological role of MetAP2 in cancer is not well understood. We examined the effect of three distinct chemical classes of MetAP2 inhibitors on the growth of a panel of human cancer cells in vitro. All MetAP2 inhibitors caused inhibition of tumor cell growth in both anchorage-dependent and, particularly, in anchorage-independent manner. These data prompted us to examine the possible roles of MetAP2 in cancers. Ectopic expression of MetAP2 in NIH-3T3 cells caused transformation, evidenced by the formation of foci in monolayer culture and growth of large colonies in soft agar. Overexpression of MetAP2 in an immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line NL20 accelerated growth. These phenotypes induced by the overexpression of MetAP2 were reversed by the treatment with MetAP2 inhibitors, indicating that the catalytic function of MetAP2 was essential. Accordingly, overexpression of a catalytically inactive MetAP2 resulted in growth retardation of HT1080 tumor cells, suggesting a dominant-negative role of the inactive MetAP2 mutant. Finally, we analysed the expression of MetAP2 in patient cancer samples by immunohistochemistry. Moderate-to-high staining was identified in the majority of breast, colon, lung, ovarian and prostate carcinomas examined. These data suggest that MetAP2 plays an important role in tumor cell growth and may contribute to tumorigenesis."

An ex vivo study was conducted to elucidate the association of G6PD deficiency and dengue virus (DENV) infection when many Asian countries are hyper-endemic. Human monocytes from peripheral mononuclear cells collected from 12 G6PD-deficient patients and 24 age-matched controls were infected with one of two DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) strains-the New Guinea C strain (from a case of dengue fever) or the 16681 strain (from a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever) with a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. The infectivity of DENV-2 in human monocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. Experimental results indicated that the monocytes of G6PD-deficient patients exhibited a greater levels of infection with DENV-2 New Guinea C strain than did those in healthy controls [mean+/-SD:33.6%+/-3.5 (27.2% approximately 39.2%) vs 20.3%+/-6.2 (8.0% approximately 30.4%), P<0.01]. Similar observations were made of infection with the DENV-2 16681 strain [40.9%+/-3.9 (35.1% approximately 48.9%) vs 27.4%+/-7.1 (12.3% approximately 37.1%), P<0.01]. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time higher infection of human monocytes in G6PD patients with the dengue virus, which may be important in increasing epidemiological transmission and perhaps with the potential to develop more severe cases pathogenically."
https://openalex.org/W1974434365,"In living cells, P2Y1 receptor dimerization was quantitated by an improved version of fluorescence resonance energy transfer donor photobleaching analysis. 44% of the P2Y1 receptors expressed in HEK293 cell membranes exist as dimers in the resting state, inducible by agonist exposure to give 85-100% dimerization. Monomer and constitutive dimers are fully active. Agonist-induced dimerization follows desensitization and is fully reversible upon withdrawal of agonist. Receptor dimers are required for internalization at 37 °C but are not sufficient; at 20 °C dimerization also occurs, but endocytosis is abolished. Removal of the C-terminal 19 amino acids abolished both dimerization and internalization, whereas full activation by agonists was retained up to a loss of 39 amino acids, confirming active monomers. This receptor is known to bind through its last four amino acids (DTSL) to a scaffolding protein, Na/H exchanger regulatory factor-2, which was endogenous here, and DTSL removal blocked constitutive dimerization specifically. Distinction should therefore be made between the following: 1) constitutive dimers tethered to a scaffolding protein, together with effector proteins, within a signaling micro-domain, and 2) free dimers in the cell membrane, which here are inducible by agonist exposure. For the class A G-protein-coupled receptors, we suggest that the percentages of free monomers, and in many cases of induced free dimers, commonly become artifactually increased; this would arise from an excess there of the receptor over its specific scaffold and from a lack of the native targeting of the receptor to that site.

In general, the clearest information has come from heterodimers, whose presence may be shown by an expanded phenotype (see Ref. 1Pin J.P. Neubig R. Bouvier M. Devi L. Filizola M. Javitch J.A.

More knowledge of homodimers is also needed. For example, does homodimerization compete with heterodimer formation or even usually predominate? The extent of homodimerization of a given GPCR, particularly in the major (rhodopsin-like) class A, and whether functioning GPCR monomers generally co-exist with dimers in that class are still unresolved issues (see Refs. 2Grant M.

Furthermore, the role of a homodimer in the life cycle of the receptor in the cell is as yet unclear, with no consensus on whether such dimers are constitutive nor whether they depend upon agonist activation (5Milligan G.

For these questions, we first need to determine the actual percentage of the membrane population of a receptor under study that is homodimeric in each relevant state, a goal as yet unattained. We have investigated these issues in the case of homodimers of the P2Y receptors for nucleotides. We report here on the P2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) (10Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), activated by extracellular ATP, and its product ADP, which are released ubiquitously in animal tissues. P2Y1R is expressed very widely therein (11Barnard E.A. Simon J. Webb T.E. Mol. Neurobiol. 1997; 15: 103-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Boeynaems J.-M. Barnard E.A.

In the nervous system, for example, it contributes to both Gq-based signaling (13Filippov A.K. Choi R.C.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Brown D.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 9340-9348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and ATP trophic actions (14Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W.M. Ling K.K.Y. Tung E.K.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect P2Y1R dimers we apply FRET, which detects with high sensitivity the energy transfer between two fluorophores when they are held in close proximity (<10 nm), as in a labeled protein oligomer. A range of such techniques is now in use for GPCRs (15Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). We have developed further the FRET donor photobleaching approach (2Grant M. Patel R.C. Kumar U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38636-38643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 225: 7862-7869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (470) Google Scholar), giving a method that has the advantages of reporting on receptors as follows: (i) in single living cells; (ii) only at the cell surface, which is critical because GPCRs in cell cultures have more intracellular content, whose association state may differ from that of the mature receptors in the cell membrane; (iii) using ratiometric kinetic analysis, which is independent of receptor density difference or local partial quenching or optical variation between cells; (iv) hence disclosing (exceptionally) the percentage of the receptor population that is dimeric, instead of the apparent efficiency (E) of the energy transfer, which is measured in other FRET methods. The percentages of the labeled receptors that are in energy transfer cannot be derived from E by any accurate method applicable in this context. This problem is avoided by using the initial state-independent kinetics of bleaching. The results show the relationships of P2Y1R dimerization to the following: (i) binding of agonist, (ii) internalization, and (iii) specific attachment to a membrane-associated scaffolding protein.

Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—hP2Y1R cDNA (18Ayyanathan K. Webb T.E. Sandhu A.K. Athwal R.S. Barnard E.A. Kunapuli S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The ΔT1, ΔT2, and DTSL truncations were made on that plasmid using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to terminate at amino acid 354, 334, or 371, respectively, with the reverse primers 5′-AACTCGAGTCAACTCTTGGATTGCAAATT-3′ (ΔT1), 5′-AACTCGAGTCATCTCCTTCTGAAAGTATC-3′ (ΔT2), and 5′-AACTCGAGTCATCCATTCTGCAAGAACTCAGG-3′ (ΔDTSL). (Stop codons are in boldface.) Each construct was transfected into HEK293 cells, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), to express either transiently (only where specified) or with selection (to full dilution cloning) for stable expression, each being cultured, as per Simon et al.

P2Y1R expression at comparable levels for each clone was confirmed by Ca2+ mobilization assays as below, at maximum response levels. Ca2+ Mobilization and Desensitization Studies—HEK293 cells transiently (where stated) or stably expressing the full or truncated Myc-P2Y1Rs were grown to form confluent monolayers (at similar densities) in clear flat-bottomed, black-walled Costar 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were then loaded with 2 μm Fluo-4AM in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; but without CaCl2), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 45 min, followed by wash (150 μl) and equilibration in HBSS (containing 2 mm CaCl2) per well. Agonist reactions and washes were performed in the latter medium, as were all the cell incubations in the studies described here. All operations were at 37 °C. Changes in fluorescence were measured (integrating the area under each peak, where quantitated) in each well in a FlexStation II robotic spectrofluorimeter (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 525 nm. Detection of NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 mRNAs—The PCR amplifications were performed on first-strand cDNA, made from Myc-hP2Y1-HEK293 cells using standard protocols, with primer sets each specific to the human NHERF-1 or NHERF-2 sequences as follows: NHERF1, 5′-AACGAAAATGAGCCTCGCGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAGGTAGACGAGGGCGCTGT-3′ (antisense); NHERF-2, 5′-AAGGCTGTGGAGGGGCAGACT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGTGTGACCCGAAGCCGCTT-3′ (antisense). Typically, a 50-μl reaction mixture contained 1st strand cDNA (3 μl), the appropriate primers (200 nm), 3 mm MgCl2, each dNTP (200 μm), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 60 s, 52 °C for 60 s, 72 °C for 60 s with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were resolved by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. ERK Phosphorylations—The Myc-hP2Y1R cells, unlabeled or antibody-labeled separately with FITC or Cy3, were prestarved of serum (4 h), incubated with agonist (10 min) as shown, washed with 1 mm Na3VO4/medium, solubilized in boiling SDS sample buffer, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, with details as given in Refs. 14Choi R.C.Y.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, including use of control lanes with serial dilutions of one of the samples tested, for confirming linearity of the response in the gel and conditions used. FRET Analysis by Donor Photobleaching—HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-hP2Y1R were cultured on 13-mm coverslips. At room temperature the living cells were pre-blocked by 5% normal goat serum in HBSS for 1 h and then doubly labeled (1 h) with FITC-anti-Myc (1:500) and Cy3-anti-Myc (1:50) Abs applied together or alone with either FITC-anti-Myc- or Cy3-anti-Myc-Ab, in HBSS plus apyrase (2 units/ml). (When the anti-Myc antibody was labeled with Cy3, that preparation was more diluted than the FITC-labeled anti-Myc, and the titers of the two led to the difference in the dilutions used, which were shown, see below, to give near-equivalent labeling on the cells.) After washing (2× 200 μl of HBSS), the cells were used at once in a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510), using a chamber thermostatted at 37 °C or (where noted) 20 °C. The doubly labeled cells showed FITC (donor) and Cy3 (acceptor) fluorescent label together on almost all of the cells, and these were selected here. (Control cells transfected with empty vector gave no significant reaction with either labeled Ab; data not shown). The rate of loss of the FITC fluorescence emission peak centered at 515 nm was measured during FITC photobleaching at 488 nm of one cell at a time, in an optically isolated constant region of its cell membrane. Bleaching was for repeated periods of 4 s, with 5-s rest intervals between them, during which time the image was captured, and continuing until the FITC signal was <10% of its original. The control cells labeled with Cy3 alone were also bleached at 488 nm, and in the intervals excited instead at 543 nm to test for bleed-through bleaching by measuring its Cy3 emission at 565 nm. All images were acquired well below saturation of the pixel intensity. The operations were standardized, and emission signals were integrated and processed in Zeiss LSM image browser package and further analyzed with Image J software. For agonist activation studies, the cultures were incubated with 2-MeSADP at the stated final concentration at 20 or 37 °C. Donor photobleaching runs, as above for each case, were performed immediately prior to the addition of agonist and on cells in samples exposed for the increasing times shown. When a P2Y1R antagonist was applied, it was present prior to the agonist addition and during the photobleaching. In the agonist wash-out case in Fig. 6D, the cultures were rapidly washed twice with 200 μl of HBSS before each photobleaching was applied. When BAPTA-AM was used it was present throughout the antibody labeling, washing, agonist incubation, and the photobleaching. Analysis of Donor Photobleaching Kinetics—From the successive emission readings on a given cell membrane region, the decline of FITC emission amplitude was analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 3 software. The great majority of the doubly labeled cells gave values highly significant for a bi-exponential fit and were used in the calculation below. (The small remainder giving different kinetics was attributable to damaged cells or optical artifact.) These decay curves could be resolved into two mono-exponential components, defined by τfast and τslow. To verify that a significant difference existed there, the data set from every cell used was separately subjected to a variance ratio test for a fit to two-component dependence, calculating its F-value with the appropriate degrees of freedom. When Cy3 was absent, the FITC decay consistently gave a highly significant mono-exponential fit, with time constant τcon (with F-values showing its identity to τfast above). For each set of conditions and agonist exposure time tested, the means ± S.E. for these component time constants were derived from the full time series from each of six cells and using two cultures. From the theory of resonance energy transfer, a two-state model (i.e. for one monomer and one dimer state) gives the following relationship (15Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar, 20Gadella T.W.J. Jovin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1543-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar): % dimerization = (fET/fa) × 100, where fa is the acceptor-labeled fraction in the total of labeled receptors, and fET is the fraction of the total donor present, which is in FRET. The relative contributions of the slow component, because of donor-acceptor dimers, and of the non-FRET fast component can be obtained from their pre-exponential coefficients (the zero time values), hence giving the value of fET. Although D-D dimers will also be present, to a smaller and predictable degree, being FRET-negative they (like A-A dimers) will not register in the slow component and do not affect the representation by fET of the total of dimers present; when the D-A dimer is maximal, total dimers are maximal. The factor fa (in equation above) is then needed for the relative occupancy of the Myc site by the donor- and the acceptor-labeled antibodies. Because the donor- and acceptor-labeled antibodies reacted in competition and in great excess to the membrane-bound receptors, the occupancy is determined by the ratio of the affinities of those antibodies for the Myc tag on the P2Y1R and the actual concentrations of the two IgGs in the reaction mixture. The value of fa was found by reacting at 20 °C (40 min) aliquots of the living HEK293 cells expressing Myc-hP2Y1R with the Cy3-labeled anti-Myc Ab, alone or in competition with the unlabeled anti-Myc Ab (parent of the FITC-labeled form used), precisely in the conditions used in the dimerization analyses. The ratio of receptor-bound Cy3 in the two cases was then determined by Cy3 spectrofluorimetry in the FlexStation II system. This method avoids the acceptor spectral change because of donor addition and FRET, and can be used because it was shown (Fig. 1) that the labeled anti-Myc Ab and the same unlabeled Ab have (as expected) the same affinity for the Myc-hP2Y1R. The fET for each experimental case, plus the fa factor, then yielded, as above, the values of the % dimerization. Acceptor Photobleaching—Living HEK293 cells on 13-mm coverslips stably expressing Myc-hP2Y1R were treated with 2-MeSADP (10 μm, 20 min, 20 °C) and immediately fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde, 10 min, followed by 50 mm NH4Cl, 25 min, and HBSS washing. Cultures were pre-blocked by 5% goat serum as above and then incubated with both the FITC-conjugated (1:500) and the Cy3-conjugated (1:50) anti-Myc antibodies (4 °C, 16 h, in HBSS) followed by washes (five times for 10 min) and ethanol dehydration. The mounted cultures were analyzed by laser confocal microscopy of a defined membrane region of each cell as above. Cy3 photobleaching at 543 nm was for a series of 10-s periods, with intervals of 10 s between them, during which spectral scanning was made. The size of the initial Cy3 peak (set as 100%) provided an internal standard for each membrane region studied. It was checked that no significant local heating occurred in the bleaching conditions used. Cy3 was preferred over the rhodamines usually used as bleachable acceptors for FITC, despite Cy3 bleaching more slowly, because the spectra of the rhodamines (but not Cy3) change considerably and suffer partial quenching when conjugated to a protein (21Meadows D.L. Shafer J.S. Schultz J.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 143: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), compromising quantitation of FRET. Receptor Internalization—Living HEK293 cells stably expressing Myc-hP2Y1R were labeled with FITC-anti-Myc-Ab (1:500) in HBSS at room temperature for 1 h. Following HBSS washing (two times for 5 min), they were incubated with HBSS or with 10 μm 2-MeSADP in HBSS in the confocal microscope chamber at 37 or 20 °C. Images were captured at the times shown. Phase contrast images were taken simultaneously to confirm focusing. Images were analyzed by the LSM Image Analyzer software, with line scanning across the cell or Z-stacking, but avoiding the nucleus. Where fixation is specified, live cultures were incubated ± agonist similarly at 37 °C, 1 h, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (without permeabilizing agent), 10 min, and 50 mm NH4Cl, 25 min. They were pre-blocked by 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (20 °C, 1 h) and then incubated with anti-Myc antibody (1:1000) in blocking solution at 4 °C, 16 h. After PBS washes (five times for 10 min), TO-PRO-3 (1:2000, 20 °C, 2 h) was applied to show cell nuclei. Alexa-488-labeled secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was used here for the anti-Myc case to increase the fluorescent label number to detect low levels of internalization. After PBS washes (three times for 10 min) and ethanol dehydrations, the cultures were mounted in anti-fade medium (DAKO, UK). Labeled cells were Z-scanned in confocal microscopy, in 1-μm steps from base to top; excitation 488 nm/emission 520 nm (Alexa-488) and 642 nm/660 nm for the TO-PRO-3 pseudo-color. Statistics—Significance, determined by t test, was set at p < 0.05. The mean ± S.E. is stated, or in the quantitative figures is shown by bars (except where too small to show), based on three or more samples, each measured in triplicate, unless otherwise stated. Dose-response plots were best fit curves to a Hill equation (in GraphPad Prism 3). In all the imaging, dose response, gel analysis, and desensitization figures, the results shown are representative of three or more independent replicates of the experiments illustrated. P2Y1 Receptors with Extracellular FRET Donor or Acceptor Probes—Anti-Myc antibodies directly conjugated to fluorescein (FITC; FRET donor, D) or to Cy3 (acceptor, A) were applied together to living HEK293 cells stably expressing N-terminal Myc-tagged hP2Y1Rs. The two alternative products, designated as FITC-hP2Y1R and Cy3-hP2Y1R proteins, each showed in confocal microscopy a distribution over the whole cell surface, indistinguishable for those two (Fig. 1A). Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization by the surface P2Y1R activity was evoked by exposure to the selective agonist 2-MeSADP; the agonist EC50 value was unchanged after the addition of the Myc epitope (Fig. 1B). There was also no change in EC50 after the further attachment of the labeled Ab (illustrated in Fig. 1, E and F) for P2Y1R downstream signaling through ERK and with the weaker agonist 2-MeSATP. Dimers of Cell Surface P2Y1Rs, Two Photobleaching-based Approaches—Fluorescein is readily photobleached at 488 nm. This process was detected maximally at its emission peak of 515 nm, monitored in cells containing only FITC-anti-Myc-hP2Y1 (Fig. 2A, top panels). This signal was measured at the cell membrane (as optically isolated), showing an exponential decay with that exposure (Fig. 2B, open circles). In the cells containing both FITC-P2Y1R and Cy3-P2Y1R, the same 488 nm exposure produced a slower decline of the FITC fluorescence (Fig. 2, A, lower panels, and B, closed circles). This protection is because of FRET between the attached FITC and Cy3 groups. There was negligible photobleaching at 488 nm of Cy3 in the same cells (Fig. 2B). This retardation of donor photobleaching by acceptor interaction was found to be enhanced by P2Y1 agonist stimulation, to a maximum after 20 min with 10 μm 2-MeSADP (37 °C), as detailed below. Those conditions were therefore applied in an independent confirmation of FRET by spectral analysis. FRET decreases donor emission and gives a donor-sensitized increase in acceptor emission. This was assessed by suppressing the effect of FRET on the donor by progressive photobleaching of the acceptor. The FITC emission then rose in each cell, which can only be due to initial FRET (Fig. 2, C-E). This produced, at 30% loss of Cy3 emission (in 20 agonist-treated bleached cells from three independent experiments), a doubling of the FITC emission, denoting a high FRET level and dimer content. Quantitation of Dimer Formation and Its Dual Response to Sustained Agonist Reaction—The photobleaching of the donor-labeled receptors, when present alone so that FRET was absent (control), best fitted a single exponential decay curve in all cases, with a time constant designated τcon. In the dual-labeled cells, in contrast, the bleaching decay (Fig. 2B) showed complex kinetics, which could be resolved analytically (see “Experimental Procedures”) into two mono-exponential components, defined by time-constants τfast and τslow. In all such dual labeling analyses, τfast was constant and not significantly different from τcon of the control FITC-labeled receptors without FRET. The τfast component represents control (non-FRET) donor bleaching in monomers and in the lesser fraction of donor-donor dimer present. The relative contribution of the τslow component to the total decay there was thus readily determined (representing the fraction of P2Y1Rs in energy transfer, fET, i.e. in dimers). The observed fET value requires correction for the relative labeling of donor and acceptor in the reaction conditions used. That ratio was determined directly, by competition and fluorimetry, to correct fET (see “Experimental Procedures”) to yield the percentage of dimers in the P2Y1R population in each set of conditions tested. Living cells doubly labeled as before were subjected to donor photobleaching (Fig. 2A) to thus determine the % dimerization in several conditions as follows. (i) Because the P2Y1R agonists ATP and ADP accumulate in the medium of those cultured cells, they were removed by their scavenger apyrase up to the start of bleaching, to establish the nucleotide-free constitutive level. This reduced significantly the observed dimer content, from “basal” of 44 ± 3% to 28 ± 2% (Fig. 3A), i.e. the automatic exposure to endogenously released agonists had increased P2Y1R dimer formation. (ii) Using the apyrase-pretreated cells, 2-MeSADP produced a further increase in dimerization, which is concentration-dependent up to a maximum at 10 μm agonist; that increase was preventable with the P2Y1R antagonist (22Nandanan E. Jang S.Y. Moro S. Kim H.O. Siddiqui M.A. Russ P. Marquez V.E. Busson R. Herdewijn P. Hardwn T.K. Boyer J.L. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) MRS 2179 (Fig. 3A). The antagonist-resistant dimer content and also that in the apyrase-treated control confirm a constitutive level of 28% dimers for the hP2Y1R at 37 °C. (iii) Binding of the Ab does not affect the agonist-promoted dimerization (Fig. 3B). This was confirmed independently in the acceptor photobleaching study; there, the activation by 10 μm 2-MeSADP, which was given prior to dual Ab labeling, gave a high degree of FRET (Fig. 2D) similar to that noted above. Therefore, apyrase-pretreated cells carrying dually labeled P2Y1Rs were incubated with 10 μm 2-MeSADP, and the donor photobleaching kinetic analysis as above was performed on single cells. Dimers in the cell membrane increased, to 85 ± 4% of the receptors after 20 min in agonist at 37 °C or 30 min at 20 °C. Beyond that, the dimer content declined, at 20 °C to a steady level of 45 ± 5%, but after ∼30 min at 37 °C the receptor content of the membranes became too low for dimer analysis (Fig. 3C). At 37 °C this loss was shown to be due to dimer internalization and sequestration in sub-membranal compartments, by following the fate of pre-labeled receptors on the intact cells. Thus, after 20-50 min of subsequent agonist treatment a"
https://openalex.org/W2020037420,"Cytochrome P450cin (CYP176A1) is a bacterial P450 isolated from Citrobacter braakii that catalyzes the hydroxylation of cineole to (S)-6β-hydroxycineole. This initiates the biodegradation of cineole, enabling C. braakii to live on cineole as its sole source of carbon and energy. P450cin lacks the almost universally conserved threonine residue believed to be involved in dioxygen activation and instead contains an asparagine at this position (Asn-242). To investigate the role of Asn-242 in P450cin catalysis, it was converted to alanine, and the resultant mutant was characterized. The characteristic CO-bound spectrum and spectrally determined KD for substrate binding were unchanged in the mutant. The x-ray crystal structures of the substrate-free and -bound N242A mutant were determined and show that the only significant change is in a reorientation of the substrate such that (R)-6α-hydroxycineole should be a major product. Molecular dynamics simulations of both wild type and mutant are consistent with the change in regio- and stereoselectivity predicted from the crystal structure. The mutation has only a modest effect on enzyme activity and on the diversion of the NADPH-reducing equivalent toward unproductive peroxide formation. Product profile analysis shows that (R)-6α-hydroxycineole is the main product, which is consistent with the crystal structure. These results demonstrate that Asn-242 is not a functional replacement for the conserved threonine in other P450s but, rather, is critical in controlling regioselective substrate oxidation.

Members of the superfamily of cytochromes P450 (P450s) catalyze an impressive array of oxidative transformations and are key enzymes in processes as varied as human xenobiotic metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and bacterial biodegradation. P450s utilize molecular oxygen as the ultimate oxidant in the reaction R-H + NAD(P)H + O2 + H+ → R-OH + NAD(P)+ + H2O. The enzyme forms a hydroperoxy, Fe(III)-OOH, intermediate (1Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) during the catalytic cycle. Proper protonation of the distal oxygen results in heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide O-O bond, thus generating the active ferryl species, Fe(IV) = O, responsible for substrate oxidation, whereas protonation of the proximal oxygen directly linked to the iron atom would give rise to hydrogen peroxide. A threonine that is almost universally conserved across all P450s has been implicated in the control of this process (2Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M.

Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31659-31663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whatever the exact mechanistic role of the threonine, it is generally required for efficient P450-catalyzed oxidation of a substrate. For example, mutation of the conserved threonine to alanine in P450cam, a widely studied model enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas putida, results in a majority of NADH-reducing equivalents being funneled into hydrogen peroxide formation rather than hydroxylated product (4Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 5Martinis S.A. Atkins W.M. Stayton P.S. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 9252-9253Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Such non-productive use of electrons is generally termed uncoupling and may result in the formation of water or superoxide in addition to hydrogen peroxide. A small number of P450s exist that naturally lack the conserved threonine. The majority of these do not catalyze the activation of molecular oxygen but, rather, the rearrangement of a hydroperoxide already present in the substrate. Examples include thromboxane synthase, prostacyclin synthase (6Salmon J.A. Flower R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), or members of CYP74 subfamilies (7Tijet N. Brash A.R.

P450EryF is a rare example of a P450 that lacks the conserved threonine but which can efficiently catalyze hydroxylation of a non-activated carbon. In this case, a hydroxyl group present within the substrate is essential for correct protonation of the ferric hydroperoxy intermediate and efficient catalysis (11Andersen J.K. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Xiang H. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35999-36006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that the substrate hydroxyl facilitates the transfer of solvent protons to the iron-linked dioxygen site (13Cupp-Vickery J.R. Han O. Hutchinson C.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 632-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, recent x-ray crystallographic studies show that water is expelled from the active site upon oxygen binding to the P450eryF-substrate complex, leaving the substrate hydroxyl as the most likely candidate for delivering the required proton (14Nagano S. Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22102-22107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). P450cin provides a second example of a P450 that catalyzes a hydroxylation reaction but lacks the conserved threonine (see Fig. 1). P450cin was isolated from Citrobacter braakii and is thought to initiate a cascade of biodegradative reactions that allows the bacterium to live on cineole as its sole carbon and energy source. Sequence alignments have shown that the conserved threonine is absent and is replaced by an asparagine residue (Asn-242). The crystal structure of P450cin shows that Asn-242 donates an H-bond to the substrate ethereal oxygen (15Meharenna Y.T. Li H. David B.H. Hawkes D.B. Pearson A.G. De Voss J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9487-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this paper we address the following question. Is Asn-242 a functional replacement for the conserved threonine in P450cin? Clearly it would be capable of H-bonding and stabilizing the water network believed to be necessary for normal catalytic function and, thus, may be essential for substrate hydroxylation. Secondly, does Asn-242 play an important role in the high affinity of P450cin for cineole, and/or does it control the regio- and stereochemistry of substrate oxidation? Here we report the enzymatic properties and crystal structures of the N242A P450cin mutant in the presence and absence of cineole. Construction of N242A Mutant—The N242A mutant was generated in two PCR steps using forward (CP-1, 5′-CCGAATTCCATATGACTGCGACAGTCGC-3′) and reverse (CP-2, 5′-CCGAATTCTAGAGGAGCTTGCTCATTCCG-3′) flanking primers (16Hawkes D.B. Adams G.W. Burlingame A.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27725-27732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and forward (N242A-f, 5′-CTCGGCGGCATCGACGCCACCGCACGCTTCCTC-3′) and reverse (N242A-r, 3′-CGCCGTAGCTGCGGTGGCGTGCGAAGGAGTCG-5′) mutagenic primers, pCW-P450cin as a template, and Vent® DNA polymerase. In the first step two separate reactions were carried out, one with CP-1 and N242A-r and one with CP-2 and N242A-f. Both contained pCW-P450cin as template DNA and were performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 100 s, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 60s, and 72 °C for 60s. Extension was concluded with incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The two partially overlapping DNA fragments obtained were purified using a QIAquick® PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The two partially overlapping PCR fragments produced above were then used as both primer and template to direct amplification of a complete gene construct. A PCR experiment containing the two PCR fragments was performed under the following conditions: 10 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 61 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. CP-1 and CP-2 were then added followed by another 25 cycles using the same conditions given above. The reaction was concluded with incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The 1.2-kilobase PCR product was cloned into pUC18 using the SureClone® Ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Finally, a ∼0.8-kilobase fragment containing the mutation was excised from the pUC18 construct using NcoI/pPUM1 and ligated into similarly digested pCW-P450cin. Expression and Purification of the P450cin N242A Mutant—The P450cin N242A mutant was expressed and purified as reported in the literature for wild type P450cin (16Hawkes D.B. Adams G.W. Burlingame A.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27725-27732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This yielded ∼90 nmol of purified protein/liter of original culture. Substrate Binding—The dissociation constant (KD) for the enzyme-substrate complex was calculated using a standard procedure (16Hawkes D.B. Adams G.W. Burlingame A.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. De Voss J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27725-27732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NADPH Consumption—The standard reaction mixture (Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.4, total volume of 800 μl) contained a P450 (0.5 μm), cindoxin (10 μm), Escherichia coli reductase (5 μm), cineole (1 μl), and NADPH (200 μm). NADPH was added last to initiate the reaction. The rate of NADPH consumption was calculated by monitoring the disappearance of absorbance at 340 nm. Determination of Coupling—To calculate the percentage coupling (NADPH consumed:product formed), a solution (800 μl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing a P450 (0.5 μm), cindoxin (4 μm), E. coli reductase (1 μm), catalase (1 μm), cineole (6 mm), and a known amount of NADPH (∼1–2 mm) was incubated at 25 °C for 1.5 h. α-Terpineol (400 μl, 1.03 mm) was added as an internal standard, and the reaction mixture was extracted into ethyl acetate (0.5 ml) and the extract dried (MgSO4). The samples were analyzed by gas chromatography on a DB-WAX polar column under the following conditions: 80 °C for 2 min, 10 °C/min to 200 °C, hold 20 min. The amount of hydroxycineole produced was determined via a standard curve generated from stock solutions of α-terpineol and hydroxycineole. This was then compared with the amount of NADPH added to calculate the percentage coupling. H2O2 Production—The amount of H2O2 formed was measured using an iron(II) thiocyanate assay as previously described (17Starkovich J.A. Roubal W.T. J. Food. Sci. 1969; 34: 194-195Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) contained P450 (0.5 μm), cindoxin (4 μm), E. coli reductase (1 μm), cineole (6 mm), and a known concentration of NADPH (∼1–2 mm). Product Stereochemistry—A standard reaction was performed as described above for determination of H2O2 production. The reaction was extracted into ethyl acetate (0.5 ml), and this was then evaporated under a gentle stream of N2. The sample was redissolved in dichloromethane (400 μl), trifluoroacetic anhydride (150 μl) was added, and the mixture left to stand at room temperature for 30 min. The dichloromethane was removed under a gentle stream of N2, and the sample was redissolved in ethyl acetate. Analysis of the esterified hydroxycineoles was performed on a gas chromatograph fitted with a cyclodextrin B enantioselective column under the following conditions: 120 °C for 2 min, 1 °C/min to 200 °C. Retention times were compared with synthetic standards (18Carman R.M. Fletcher M.T. Aust. J. Chem. 1984; 37: 1117-1122Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that had been identically derivatized. Crystallization—Crystallization of cytochrome P450cin N242A mutant was carried out using sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Drops of 4 μl were prepared by adding 2 μl of 42 mg/ml protein and 2 μl of well solution for the substrate-free samples and 2 μl of 21 mg/ml protein and 2 μl of well solution for the substrate (cineole)-bound protein. These were equilibrated against a well solution of 0.8 m sodium malonate, pH 8.0. A single plate crystal that was separated from a cluster of plates was used for data collection. Before freezing crystals in liquid nitrogen for cryogenic data collection, crystals were transferred to a solution containing 2.5 m sodium malonate as the cryoprotectant. Two data sets were collected for the N242A mutant in the presence and absence of substrate. Both the substrate-free and cineole-bound structures of P450cin N242A mutant belong to the monoclinic space group P21 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. However, they showed different cell dimensions (Table 1).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsN242A without cineoleN242A with cineoleCell dimensions (Å)a = 63.33, b = 68.28, c = 103.60a = 59.40, b = 128.7, c = 69.0Space group P21β = 95.50β = 97.8Data resolution (Å)2.03.05Total observations115,432109,815Unique reflections46,40917,907RsymaRsym = Σ|I – 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the averaged intensity of multiple symmetry related observations of the reflection0.071 (0.364)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shell0.149 (0.491)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shell〈I/σ〉8.6 (2.3)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shell5.5 (2.1)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shellCompleteness0.78 (0.74)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shell0.911 (0.801)bThe values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shellRedundancy2.56.1R factorcR factor = Σ||Fo|| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively0.1810.237R-freedR-free was calculated with the 5% of reflections set aside randomly throughout the refinement0.2270.313No. of protein atoms6,9426,510No. of hetero atoms114108No. of waters584114a Rsym = Σ|I – 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the observed intensity, and 〈I〉 is the averaged intensity of multiple symmetry related observations of the reflectionb The values in parentheses were obtained in the outermost resolution shellc R factor = Σ||Fo|| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectivelyd R-free was calculated with the 5% of reflections set aside randomly throughout the refinement Open table in a new tab Data Collection and Structure Determination—X-ray diffraction data were collected on beam line 5.0.2 at ALS (Berkeley, CA) using an ADSCQ315, 3 × 3 CCD array detector. Optimization of data collection was guided by the STRATEGY function of MOSFLM (19Leslie A.G.W. Jnt CCP4/ESF-EACMB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar). All data were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK, and rejections were performed with SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). The substrate-free and -bound structures of cytochrome P450cin N242A mutant were solved using molecular replacement as implemented in AMORE in the CCP4 suite (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) and the wild type cytochrome P450cin structure complexed with cineole (Protein Data Bank code 1T2B) (15Meharenna Y.T. Li H. David B.H. Hawkes D.B. Pearson A.G. De Voss J. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9487-9494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as the search model. Starting with the wild type model, side chains of cytochrome P450cin N242A mutant were fit into the electron density map using the graphical model building program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). However, because of the absence of the substrate (in the substrate free structure) compared with those in the wild type, it was necessary to manually adjust stretches of backbone. Many rounds of model building and simulated annealing refinements with CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar) structure generated a well improved electron density map that enabled the construction of some difficult regions, including the N terminus and F/G-loop region. In the 2.0-Å substrate-free structure it was anticipated that water would coordinate the heme iron in the absence of substrate, but it was clear from the earliest Fo - Fc maps that something much larger interacts with iron. The shape and size of the electron density envelopes indicated that malonate binds to the heme iron in multiple orientations. The cineole bound structure on the other hand diffracted to only 3.05 Å. Although the resolution is limited, it was possible to clearly see the substrate, and the orientation of the substrate was deduced by performing several minimization rounds using CNS and different fittings using O. Waters were added using the WATERPICK routine during several additional rounds of refinement and model building. The final cineole-bound model contains 6732 atoms, residues Met-8 —Glu-404, heme, 1,8-cineole, and 114 water molecules, whereas the substrate-free structure had a total of 7640 atoms, residues Met-8 —Glu-404, heme, malonate, and 548 water molecules. The refined structure has a Rfree values of 18.1 and 22.7% and R values of 22.6 and 31.8% for the substrate-free and -bound structures. Backbone geometry was checked in PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). All the residues fall into the allowed region in the Ramachandran plot. The atomic coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank with the Protein Data Bank codes 3BDZ and 3BE0, respectively, for the substrate-free and -bound structures. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1. Figures were prepared with PYMOL. Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with Amber 9.0. Charges and optimal geometry for cineole were obtained using density functional theory and the 6–31G* basis set as implemented in JAGUAR, whereas heme parameters were provided by Dr. Dan Harris (25Harris D.L. Park J.Y. Gruenke L. Waskell L. Proteins. 2004; 15: 895-914Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The crystal structures were stripped of crystallographically defined water molecules except for one water molecule near the substrate in the N242A mutant. This new water molecule found in the mutant was retrained to its crystallographic position using a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/Å. The protein was solvated with TIP3 waters within a 30-Å radius sphere around the substrate. The entire solvated protein was energy minimized as follows. First, water and H atoms were allowed to move in a short 10-ps low temperature (50 K) MD 4The abbreviations used are: MD, molecular dynamics; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. simulation followed by 500 cycles of energy minimization for both protein and solvent. Second, both protein and solvent were allowed to move in a 10-ps 50 K MD simulation followed by 500 cycles of energy minimization. Finally, a 2-ns MD simulation was carried out at 300 K. Residues within a 20-Å sphere surrounding the substrate were allowed to move. Coordinates sets were saved every 10 ps, giving a total 200 coordinate sets. The molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface accessibility (26Massova I. Kollman P.A. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8133-8143Crossref Scopus (490) Google Scholar) method was used for estimating the free energy of cineole binding. In this method several energetic calculations are carried out for the enzyme alone, the enzyme-substrate complex, and the substrate alone using the last 150 structures generated during the 2-ns MD simulation. This enables the ΔG of binding to be estimated, whereas ΔΔG = ΔGbinding(wild type) - ΔGbinding(mutant). Construction and Expression of N242A Mutant—The gene encoding the N242A P450cin mutant was produced by PCR utilizing a “mega-primer” method. Mutagenic primers were used in which the AAC codon for Asn-242 was replaced with the GCC codon for alanine. The identity of the mutant was verified by sequencing after initial cloning of the PCR construct into pUC18. Expression and purification of the encoded protein was carried out under previously reported conditions to give a homogeneous sample by SDS-PAGE analysis. The level of expression (90 nmol/liter original culture) was estimated using the extinction coefficient reported for wild type P450cin and was significantly lower than that observed for the wild type enzyme (500–2000 nmol/liter). The purity of the N242A mutant was followed using the ratio of the absorbance at 417 nm to that at 280 nm (Reinheitzahl ratio), and the purified protein had an A417/A280 ratio greater than 1.3, as did wild type P450cin. Characterization of the N242A Mutant—The UV-visible absorption spectra of the wild type and N242A P450cin ferric forms both have a maximum at 417 nm. This maximum shifts to 392 nm upon the addition of cineole, but the percentage spin change observed in the mutant (30%) is smaller than that observed when wild type enzyme binds cineole. This spectral change is typical of a bacterial P450 when it binds substrate and results from a shift in the heme iron from low to high spin as a result of the expulsion of water from the active site, particularly the axial aqua ligand. The purified N242A protein displayed the CO-difference spectra characteristic of P450s (λmax ∼ 450 nm), with no absorption observed at 420 nm due to an inactive form of the P450 (Fig. 2). The binding affinity of the N242A mutant for cineole was determined by UV-visible difference spectroscopy utilizing the spin state change and consequent spectral shift in the Soret that occurs when substrate binds. The dissociation constant of cineole from N242A P450cin (0.3 μm) was comparable with that observed for wild type P450cin (0.7 μm), with both binding cineole tightly. Similar unchanged (or increased) affinities have been reported for the analogous threonine to alanine mutants in P450cam and P450BM3 with their cognate substrates (27Hishiki T. Shimada H. Nagano S. Egawa T. Kanamori Y. Makino R. Park S.Y. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Ishimura Y. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of P450cin with substrate bound shows an H-bond from Asn-242 to the ethereal oxygen of the cineole (Fig. 1). This must clearly be absent in the mutant, but its loss is not reflected in a change in the affinity of the protein for cineole. This is in line with the result observed for the Y96F P450cam mutant in which a H-bond from the protein to the substrate is lost without noticeable change in affinity (28Atkins W.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18842-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Deprez E. Gill E. Helms V. Wade R.C. Hui Bon Hoa G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the architecture of the active site and, in particular, the heme environment is maintained in the N242A mutant, a conclusion borne out by subsequent structural characterization to be described next. Substrate-free Crystal Structure—As shown in Fig. 1, Asn-242 in the I helix in P450cin donates an H-bond to the substrate and, thus, provides the only polar interaction between protein and substrate. The N242A mutant structure is the same as the wild type structure with no significant differences other than the site of mutation. An additional benefit of the N242A mutant was access to the structure of the substrate-free protein since many attempts to crystallize the wild type substrate-free enzyme have been unsuccessful. There now are a growing number of examples of P450s where the enzyme adopts an “open” conformation in the absence of substrate and a “closed” conformation with substrate bound. The range of motions can be very large as in P4502B4, where some groups move as much as 18 Å (30Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We, therefore, were hoping to obtain a P450cin structure in the open conformation. Instead we found that the N242A substrate-free structure is very similar to the substrate-bound wild type structure, both being in a closed conformation. The only significant difference between the substrate-free and bound structures is in the F-G loop region (Fig. 1). This is similar to P450cam where the substrate-free and -bound structures were found to be the same with the only difference being higher thermal B factors in the F/G loop region in the substrate-free structure (32Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5314-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). This is perhaps not too surprising since the F and G helices as well as the F/G loop are known to undergo large changes in those P450 structures where open and closed structures have been determined (30Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 31Scott E.E.

Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also had anticipated that water would take the place of the substrate and one molecule would coordinate the heme iron as has been found in a number of other bacterial P450s. Instead we found a lobe of electron density consistent with a molecule much larger than water coordinated to the iron atom. Because the crystals had been soaked in 2.5 m malonate as a cryoprotectant, it seemed reasonable that the extra density is due to a malonate carboxyl oxygen coordinated to the heme iron. The size and shape of the electron density envelope is consistent with malonate but not in a single orientation. It, thus, appears that malonate coordinates with the heme iron but is able to do so in more than one orientation. The best model consistent with the electron density maps is shown in Fig. 3. Because a ligand is bound, it could be argued that P450cin adopts the closed conformation. However, malonate is small, charged, and does not occupy the substrate binding pocket. In addition there are no nearby Lys, Arg, or His residues that can provide electrostatic stabilization to malonate, so there appears to be little energetic incentive for the protein to close down around the iron-coordinated malonate. Thus, P450cin is similar to P450cam where only the closed conformation is found in the crystal struct"
https://openalex.org/W1985233068,"Phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL3) is up-regulated in cancer metastases. However, little is known of PRL3-mediated cellular signaling pathways. We previously reported that elevated PRL3 expression increases Src kinase activity, which likely contributes to the increased tumorigenesis and metastasis potential of PRL3. PRL3-induced Src activation is proposed to be indirect through down-regulation of Csk, a negative regulator of Src. Given the importance of PRL3 in tumor metastasis and the role of Csk in controlling Src activity, we addressed the mechanism by which PRL3 mediates Csk down-regulation. PRL3 is shown to exert a negative effect on Csk protein synthesis, rather than regulation of Csk mRNA levels or protein turnover. Interestingly, the preferential decrease in Csk protein synthesis is a consequence of increased eIF2 phosphorylation resulting from PRL3 expression. Reduced Csk synthesis also occurs in response to cellular stress that induces eIF2 phosphorylation, indicating that this regulatory mechanism may occur in response to a wider spectrum of cellular conditions known to direct translational control. Thus, we have uncovered a previously uncharacterized role for PRL3 in the gene-specific translational control of Csk expression."

One such difference is in regulating the subcellular localization of their downstream kinases, such as PRAK (p38-regulated/activated protein kinase or MK5). The p38α-PRAK complex is found in the nucleus, whereas the p38β-PRAK complex is exclusively localized to the cytosol. By generating a series of chimeric and point mutants of p38α and p38β, we found two amino acid residues (Asp145 and Leu156 in p38α, Gly145 and Val156 in p38β) that determine the distinct subcellular locations of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK. The subcellular localization of MK2 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2), another downstream kinase of p38, was regulated in the same manner as that of PRAK. We found that nuclear import, but not export, determines the subcellular localization of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK. The published structure of the p38α-MK2 complex suggests Leu156 of p38α is involved in the interaction with the nuclear localization signal in PRAK. The difference at this residue between p38α and p38β may affect the nuclear localization signal in PRAK differently, and thereby influence the import of the complexes. Asp145 in p38α (or Gly145 in p38β) is located on a different surface patch, and further random mutagenesis revealed that mutation of Asp145, Thr123, and Gln325, the residues that can directly interact with importin α as predicted by modeling, but not mutation of the other 7 amino acid residues that cannot reach importin α, re-locate p38α-PRAK to the cytosol, suggesting that interaction with import machinery is involved in determining the subcellular localization of the p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK complexes. Last, we show that nuclear localization of PRAK is required for its role in inhibiting the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells. In conclusion, multiple determinants control the distinct subcellular localization of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK complexes, and the location of PRAK plays a role in its function. p38α and p38β MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) share about 80% of their protein sequence identity, but have quite different biological functions.

The physical location of a protein is essential for its biological function in eukaryotic cells, in which many proteins traffic continuously, whereas others selectively localize to different subcellular compartments. The best understood system for the transport of macromolecules between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is the nuclear import and export pathway (1Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 2Lusk C.P. Blobel G. King M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this pathway, nuclear import and export of proteins is mediated through the nuclear pore complex by a superfamily of transport receptors known collectively as karyopherins (1Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These proteins recognize specific signal sequences, the nuclear localization signal (NLS) 3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear location signal; NES, nuclear export signal; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MK2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; PRAK, p38-regulated/activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; MNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase 1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 3The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear location signal; NES, nuclear export signal; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MK2, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2; PRAK, p38-regulated/activated protein kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; MNK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase 1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. and nuclear export signal (NES), in the proteins being transported. The typical NLSs contain a cluster of basic amino acids as is exemplified by the SV40 large T-antigen with the amino acid sequence PKKKRKV and is known to be bound with importin α (5Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 6Conti E. Kuriyan J.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). NESs identified up to now are rich in hydrophobic amino acids, such as leucine or isoleucine. The traffic of some proteins between the cytoplasm and nucleus is mediated by a chaperon (8La B.S. Hughes T. O'Hare P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Asally M. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 308: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Smith S. de Lange T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these systems, the NLS or NES is not in the proteins being transported, but in the chaperon. The transport of p38α MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase) is chaperoned by either MK2 (MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2) or PRAK (p38-regulated/activated kinase or MK5) that carries conventional NLS and NES sequences (11Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, other methods of p38α translocation may exist, since the homologous protein of p38 in yeast, Hog1, can be translocated into the nucleus in an importin α-independent mechanism without interacting with an NLS-containing chaperon (13Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The p38 group of protein kinases is one of the four subfamilies of the MAP kinase family that plays a role in a variety of biological processes that include cell proliferation, differentiation, senescence, and cell death (14Han J. Sun P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Natale D.R. Paliga A.J. Beier F. D'Souza S.J. Watson A.J. Dev.

Immunol. 2006; 6: 532-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). None of the p38 group kinases contains NLS or NES sequences, but their subcellular localization can be regulated, at least in some cases, by their interacting proteins. It needs to be noted that they are not passively regulated by their chaperons. An interesting pair in this group is p38α and p38β, which can in turn regulate the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of their interacting proteins, such as PRAK, via an unknown mechanism (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PRAK is not only a chaperon of p38α and p38β, but also a substrate of the p38 group kinases that can inhibit Ras-mediated cell proliferation (18Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C. Han J.

New L. Moser B.A. Li Y. Liao R. Xie C. Chen J. Deng Q. Yamout M. Dong M.Q. Frangou C.G. Yates III, J.R. Wright P.E. Han J. Cell. 2007; 128: 295-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). p38α and p38β have ∼80% identical amino acid sequences but exhibit vastly different functions (16Zarubin T. Han J. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). The interaction of p38α with PRAK leads to both of them being co-localized to the nucleus. In contrast, the complex of p38β and PRAK results in cytosol localization. It is unclear how these two highly homologous proteins can so dramatically localize PRAK to the different subcellular compartments. To shed light on the mechanism by which p38α and p38β differently regulate localization of PRAK, we produced a series of chimeric proteins of p38α and p38β, as well as their point mutants. We demonstrate that two amino acids (amino acids 145 and 156) in p38α and p38β are critical for them to differentially regulate the localizations of their binding partner PRAK, as well as MK2. We show that the subcellular location of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK is determined by whether they can be imported into the nucleus, and we found that both the Asp145 and Leu156 in p38α are required for p38α-PRAK importation into nucleus. Our modeling of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK complexes based on the published crystal structure of the p38α-MK2 complex suggests that residue 156 of p38α/β interacts with PRAK docking peptide, which overlaps with its NLS. Data from the mutagenesis experiments and modeling implicate the involvement of Asp145 in the interaction of the p38α-PRAK complex with importin α. In addition, we found that PRAK-mediated inhibition of NIH3T3 cell growth is dependent on its nuclear localization, highlighting the importance of the location of PRAK on its biological function. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged wild type p38α and p38β, and GFP-fused wild type PRAK were constructed as previously described (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The chimeric constructs (M1-M10) of p38α-(1-360) and p38β-(1-364) were created by PCR recombination. The amino acid sequences for them are as follows: M1, α(1-77) + β(78-364); M2, α(1-175) + β(176-364); M3, α(1-271) + β(272-364); M4, β(1-77) + α(78-360); M5, β(1-175) + α(176-360); M6, β(1-271) + α(272-360); M7, α(1-131) + β(132-364); M8, α(1-170) + β(171-364); M9, α(1-131) + β(132-170) + α(171-360); and M10, β(1-131) + α(132-170) + β(171-364). All point mutations including p38α(I134L), p38α(D145G), p38α(L156V), p38α(K165R), p38α(T123A), p38α(H107T), p38α-(L122G), p38α(L130G), p38α(I134G), p38α(R149G), p38α-(V158A), p38α(V319E), p38α(Q325G), p38β(L134I), p38β-(G145D), p38β(V156L), p38β(R165K), and GFP-PRAK(R361Q) were created using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Point mutations of GFP-PRAK(QTTG) and GFP-PRAK(SSS) were generated as described previously (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Both HEK 293T and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Transient transfections were carried out using a calcium phosphate precipitation method for HEK 293T cells, and Lipofectamine 2000 for NIH3T3 cells according to the manufacturer's instruction (Invitrogen). For co-immunoprecipitation, a DNA mixture composed of 2 μg of GFPC1-PRAK and 2 μg of pcDNA3.0-FLAG-p38α or pcDNA3-FLAG-p38β was co-transfected into HEK 293T cells. After 36 h of transfection, cells were harvested with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were then sonicated and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. FLAG-tagged p38α/p38β was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma). The samples were then boiled and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) for p38α and p38β and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for GFP-PRAK. Immunofluorescent Staining—NIH3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips in the cell culture medium, as described above, for 16 h. Expression vectors of FLAG-p38α, FLAG-p38β, and GFP-PRAK or various mutations of them were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells in different combinations as indicated where necessary. 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, followed by treatment with 0.2% Triton/PBS for 5 min. After rinsing three times with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with 10% normal rabbit blocking serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 30 min to suppress nonspecific binding of fluorochrome-conjugated IgG, followed by washing in PBS three times. Coverslips were then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibodies (Sigma) for 60 min at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS for 5 min each wash, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated rabbit IgG (diluted in 1.5-3% normal rabbit blocking serum) for 45 min at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with PBS. Cells were then stained with the DNA-binding dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.1 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min. Then the coverslips were subjected to rinsing with PBS, and finally mounted with GelMount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and kept at 4 °C. Slides were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus I×51) for GFP fluorescence, rhodamine, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining at wave-lengths of 488/507, 540/625, and 360/460 nm, respectively. Images were captured through a ×100 objective lens by a DP50 microscope digital camera system (Olympus). Cell Proliferation Assay—NIH3T3 cells were grown on coverslips in media as described above. When cells reached ∼60% confluence, they were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmids of GFP, GFP-PRAK, GFP-PRAK(QTTG), or GFP-PRAK(R361Q) alone, or in different combinations with 1 μg of p38α, p38α(D145G), p38β, or p38 β(G145D), as indicated in Fig. 7, by using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Cell proliferation was determined by BrdUrd intake assay, employing a 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Labeling and Detection Kit I (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 24 h post-transfection, the cell culture medium was changed with fresh medium supplemented with BrdUrd labeling solution (1 × concentration). After incubating the cells at 37 °C for 30 min, the BrdUrd labeling medium was aspirated and coverslips were washed in washing buffer three times. Cells were then fixed with the ethanol fixative (add 50 mm glycine solution to 70 ml of absolute ethanol to get 100 ml of fixative, pH 2.0) for 20 min. at -25 °C, followed by rinsing three times with washing buffer. Fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-BrdUrd working solution for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times. Hereafter, all coverslips were stained with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times in wash buffer, coverslips were mounted with Gel-Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and kept at 4 °C. Slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus I×51) for GFP fluorescence and BrdUrd staining. To obtain the rate of nuclear BrdUrd intake, 600 cells positive for GFP were counted for each coverslip and the percentage of BrdUrd-positive nuclei in GFP-positive cells was calculated. p53 Reporter Assays—NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with different combinations of plasmids expressing HA-PRAK, Ha-RasV12, p38α, p38β, p38α(D145G), and p38β(G145D), as indicated in Fig. 7, D and E, together with 0.5 μg of the p53-dependent reporter plasmid PG-Luc. 24 h after transfection, luciferase activities were determined and normalized to the values of β-galactosidase activity derived from cotransfection with 0.5 μg of the pCMV5-LacZ vector. The results are presented as mean ± S.D. from at least five separate experiments. Sequences in p38α and p38β That Regulate the Subcellular Location of PRAK—Our previous study showed that interaction with p38α or p38β determines the nuclear or cytosolic location of PRAK in HeLa and HEK293 cells. It was also demonstrated that GFP-PRAK, a PRAK fusion with the reporter protein GFP, adequately mimicked the subcellular localization of PRAK (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As controls in this study, ectopically expressed GFP-PRAK alone in NIH3T3 cells was found in the nucleus under a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 1A); FLAG-tagged p38α and p38β are generally diffused in the cells with some preference for FLAG-p38α in the nucleus and FLAG-p38β in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). The interactions of GFP-PRAK with FLAG-p38α and FLAG-p38β can be demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). The interaction of FLAG-p38β and GFP-PRAK leads to cytosolic localization of these two proteins, whereas the FLAG-p38α and GFP-PRAK interaction localize them to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). To better understand the structure basis of the different functions of p38α and p38β, a series of plasmids were constructed to express chimeric proteins (M1-M10) of p38α and p38β (Fig. 2A). Each of these chimeric proteins was co-expressed with GFP-PRAK in NIH3T3 cells to determine their interaction with PRAK and their effects on PRAK subcellular localization. All of these chimeric proteins retained the ability to interact with GFP-PRAK (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the subcellular localizations of GFP-PRAK and FLAG-chimeric proteins revealed that the chimeric proteins containing the p38α sequence from amino acids 132 to 170 (M2, M3, M4, M8, and M10) exhibited the same effect as wild type p38α in regulating the distribution of PRAK (Fig. 2C), whereas the chimeric mutants that contain the same sequence as p38β in the region from amino acid 132 to 170 (M1, M5, M6, M7, and M9) were co-localized with GFP-PRAK in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it is the sequence between amino acid residues 132 and 170 that determines the different functions of p38α and p38β in regulating the subcellular distribution of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK. There are four amino acids differences in the region from residues 132 to 170 between the p38α and p38β sequences (Fig. 3A). Eight mutants of p38α and p38β were generated by swapping each of these residues between p38α and p38β. None of these mutations affected the interaction between p38α (or p38β) and PRAK in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 3, B and C). However, Asp145 to Gly (D145G) and Leu156 to Val (L156V) mutations of p38α altered the subcellular localization of its complex with PRAK to the cytosol, much like the behavior of p38β in regulating PRAK subcellular localization, whereas the other two mutations (I134L and K165R) did not cause any changes (Fig. 3D). In the complementary experiments, mutations of residues 145 and 156 in p38β to their counterparts in p38α changed the role of p38β in regulating PRAK subcellular localization to that of p38α (Fig. 3E). The amino acids at 145 and 156 also determine whether the mutants behave similar to p38α or p38β in localization when expressed alone (supplemental Fig. 1). Collectively, our data demonstrate that both of these two residues are crucial for p38α and p38β to regulate PRAK subcellular localization. A switch of either residue between p38α and p38β alters the molecular conduct of p38α and p38β in regulating PRAK subcellular localization. The Subcellular Location of MK2 Can Be Regulated by p38α and p38β in the Same Way as That of PRAK—Several protein kinases, including MK2 and MNK1 (MAPK-interacting kinase 1), also interact with p38α (11Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and it is of interest to determine whether they can be regulated by p38α and p38β to their respective subcellular locations in a manner similar to that of PRAK. Both MK2 and MNK1 can interact with p38α and p38β (Fig. 4A). When expressed individually in NIH3T3 cells, GFP-MK2 and GFP-MNK1 were localized to the nucleus and cytosol, respectively (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with results obtained by other groups (11Ben-Levy R. Hooper S. Wilson R. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1049-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 23O'Loghlen A. Gonzalez V.M. Pineiro D. Perez-Morgado M.I. Salinas M. Martin M.E. Exp.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Coexpression of either p38α or p38β did not affect the cytosolic localization of MNK1 (Fig. 4C). This is not surprising, as MNK1 and PRAK are quite different in the structural location of their putative NLS. NLS in MNK1 is located at the N terminus but in PRAK it is located at the C terminus. As expected, the subcellular distribution of MK2, with its NLS being aligned well with that in PRAK, can be regulated by p38α and p38β in the same way as that of PRAK (Fig. 4D). Additionally, the mutants of p38α and p38β regulate the subcellular localization of MK2 in the same fashion as that of PRAK (Fig. 4, E and F). Nuclear Import but Not Export Is Important in Determining the Subcellular Location of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK—As we mentioned earlier, p38α and p38β do not contain NES and NLS sequences, whereas PRAK has both (Fig. 5A). To determine whether NES-mediated nuclear export plays a role of the cytosolic localization of p38β-PRAK, we used a PRAK mutant, GFP-PRAK(SSS), in which the NES motif was mutated (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutation of NES in PRAK did not affect the interaction of PRAK with p38α/β (data not shown). As expected, mutation of NES did not affect nuclear localization of PRAK when it was expressed alone in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5B) or coexpressed with p38α (data not shown). Yet, when coexpressed with p38β, GFP-PRAK(SSS) was mainly localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5C, bottom), reminiscent of the distribution pattern of wild type PRAK, indicating that NES in PRAK is not required for cytosolic localization of the p38β-PRAK complex. Treatment with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export that binds to the chromosomal region maintenance 1, had no effect on the cytosolic localization of p38β-PRAK (Fig. 5C, middle), consistent with the notion that nuclear export has no role in the cytosolic localization of the p38β-PRAK complex. Because NLS overlaps with the docking motif in PRAK (Fig. 5A), mutation of the four amino acids RKRK to QTTQ in PRAK not only abolishes its nuclear localization but also eliminates its interaction with p38α/β (12New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2603-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To separate the docking function from NLS, a mutation of R361Q in PRAK was generated, which did not alter the PRAK interaction with p38α and p38β (Fig. 5D). The R361Q mutant is localized to the cytosol when expressed alone in NIH3T3 cells, similar to the QTTQ mutant (supplemental Fig. 2), indicating that the NLS function was interrupted. As shown in Fig. 5E, wild type PRAK was localized to the nucleus when coexpressed with p38α. In contrast, the R361Q mutant was localized to the cytosol. This data suggests that NLS in PRAK is essential for the nuclear localization of p38α-PRAK. Asp145 and Leu156 in p38α Are Located on Two Different Surface Patches—The complex structures of the MK2 peptide and its complex with p38α were reported recently (25Haar E. Prabhakar P. Liu X. Lepre C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9733-9739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26White A. Pargellis C.A. Studts J.M. Werneburg B.G. Farmer B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Leu156 in p38α is located in the vicinity that interacts with MK2. Asp145 on the other hand is located on the other side of p38α close to the P-loop surface. Due to the high level of homology to p38α, we believe Gly145 and Val156 in p38β are located at the same places as their corresponding Asp145 and Leu156 in p38α. Based on the published structures of the p38α-MK2 complex, models of p38α-PRAK and p38β-PRAK complexes were made (Fig. 6A). Leu156 or Val156 (purple spheres) are located in a β strand that interacts with the docking peptides from PRAK (or other substrates such as MEF2A (red ribbon)). It is known that NLS in PRAK overlaps with its docking site for p38α and p38β. Perhaps Leu156 in p38α and Val156 in p38β affects the conformation of the NLS differently for PRAK, therefore the binding with p38β, but not with p38α, may interfere with the interaction of NLS with importin α for PRAK, preventing the nuclear import. Asp145 in p38α or Gly145 in p38β (red spheres) are located on the other side of the surface that interacts with PRAK (Fig. 6A). They may have no role in influencing the function of NLS in PRAK, but could alter the interactions with the protein(s) of import/export machinery to affect the traffic of p38α/β-PRAK complexes. Interaction with nucleoporin was shown recently to be important in ERK2 nuclear import (27Yazicioglu M.N. Goad D.L. Ranganathan A. Whitehurst A.W. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28759-28767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between p38α and p38β revealed that the sequence corresponding to the nucleoporin binding region in ERK2 is conserved between p38α and p38β, suggesting that the different functions of p38α and p38β in regulating PRAK localization is not related to their nucleoporin-binding ability. To understand the role of Asp145 (or Gly145) in regulating PRAK subcellular localization, a series of point mutations were generated in p38α for comparative analysis of their roles in the regulation of p38α for PRAK localization. Amino acid 123 in p38α is Thr and in p38β is Ser. Converting Thr123 in p38α to Ala relocated coexpressed PRAK to the cytosol (Fig. 6B). Amino acid 325 in p38α is Gln and in p38β is Glu. A Q325G mutation in p38α resulted in cytosolic localization of coexpressed PRAK (Fig. 6B). In contrast, PRAK coexpressed with p38α mutants containing single changes of H107T, L122G, L130G, I134G, R149G, V158A, or V319E were localized to the nucleus, just as with wild type p38α (Fig. 6C). A summary of point mutations on the three-dimensional structure of p38α complexed with PRAK is shown in Fig. 6D. All of these mutants retained the ability to interact with GFP-PRAK (Fig. 6E). Because the structures of importin α in complex with NLS peptides are available (5Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

Here, we address the issue of the influence of the maternal 5-HT concentration on the cardiac function of the offspring as adults. We investigated the cardiac phenotype of Tph1-invalidated mice born to Tph1 heterozygous and null mothers. Functionally, all mutants display a significant decrease of cardiac contractility, indicative of impaired left ventricular function. They exhibit progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and are unable to adapt appropriately to a pharmacological stress. Moreover, we show that the cardiopathy is more severe in adult Tph1(-/-) mice born to homozygous mothers than to heterozygous mothers. Importantly, the severity of the cardiac phenotype is inversely correlated with the plasma 5-HT concentration but not the whole-blood 5-HT concentration. Thus, plasma 5-HT concentration may be a useful index of heart failure. These findings show that cardiac function, through the plasma 5-HT concentration, is influenced by the maternal serotonergic status."
https://openalex.org/W1964618225,"In this study, we establish an MCF-7 xenograft model that mimics the progression of human breast carcinomas typified by loss of p53 integrity, development of centrosome amplification, acquired estrogen receptor (ERα) heterogeneity, overexpression of Mdm2 and metastatic spread from the primary tumor to distant organs. MCF-7 cells with abrogated p53 function (vMCF-7Dnp53) maintained nuclear ERα expression and normal centrosome characteristics in vitro. However, following mitogen stimulation, they developed centrosome amplification and a higher frequency of aberrant mitotic spindles. Centrosome amplification was dependent on cdk2/cyclin activity since treatment with the small molecule inhibitor SU9516 suppressed centriole reduplication. In contrast to the parental MCF-7 cells, when introduced into nude mice as xenografts, tumors derived from the vMCF-7DNp53 cell line developed a strikingly altered phenotype characterized by increased tumor growth, higher tumor histopathology grade, centrosome amplification, loss of nuclear ERα expression, increased expression of Mdm-2 oncoprotein and resistance to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Importantly, while MCF-7 xenografts did not develop distant metastases, primary tumors derived from vMCF-7DNp53 cells gave rise to lung metastases. Taken together, these observations indicate that abrogation of p53 function and consequent deregulation of the G1/S cell cycle transition leads to centrosome amplification responsible for breast cancer progression."

We developed a permeabilized cell assay to characterize nuclear export of the androgen receptor in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. We found that nuclear export of endogenous androgen receptor can be stimulated by short double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. This androgen receptor export pathway is dependent on ATP hydrolysis and is enhanced by phosphatase inhibition with okadaic acid. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in permeabilized cells, under the conditions that stimulate androgen receptor export, suggested that double-stranded DNA-dependent export does not simply reflect the relief of a nuclear retention mechanism. A radiolabeled androgen was used to show that the androgen receptor remains ligand-bound during translocation through the nuclear pore complex. A specific inhibitor to the DNA-dependent protein kinase, NU7026, inhibits androgen receptor export and phosphorylation. In living cells, NU7026 treatment increases androgen-dependent transcription from endogenous genes that are regulated by androgen receptor.

AR is important for proper development of male secondary sexual characteristics and for normal prostate function (2Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3001-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). AR is also thought to be critical for the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) and for the progression of PCa from an androgen-sensitive to an androgen-insensitive state (3Culig Z. Hobisch A.

Thus, in PCa xenografts in mice, elevation of AR mRNA levels has been correlated with PCa progression to hormone-insensitive status (9Chen C.D. Welsbie D.S. Tran C. Baek S.H. Chen R. Vessella R.

AR transcriptional regulatory functions are dependent on the proper subcellular localization of the receptor. AR is thought to associate with a heat shock protein 90 (hsp90)-based chaperone complex in the cytoplasm (10Prescott J. Coetzee G.A. Cancer Lett. 2006; 231: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) until the binding of cognate ligand induces a conformational change in AR, chaperone dissociation, and subsequent AR nuclear import (discussed in Refs. 11Tyagi R.K.

Once in the nucleus, AR can bind specific androgen-response elements (AREs) to enhance or repress transcription of associated androgen-responsive genes.

The DBD of AR is sufficient to direct nuclear export of a reporter protein, and point mutations in the DBD of full-length AR reduce nuclear export without affecting import (16Black B.E. Holaska J.M.

The PCa xenograft LAPC-4 has been used to show that under low androgen conditions the steady state localization of AR is different in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent forms of the tumor (17Zhang L.

Thus, defining the mechanisms responsible for regulating AR protein levels and subcellular localization could provide insight into the molecular events that underlie PCa progression.

Comprised of a large (∼470 kDa) catalytic and two Ku regulatory subunits, DNA-PK is involved in the nonhomologous end-joining response to DNA damage, V(D)J recombination, and retroviral DNA integration (20Collis S.J.

Furthermore, the Ku subunits of DNA-PK can be localized to the promoter of the endogenous AR-responsive PSA gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and they act as AR transcriptional coactivators in reporter assays (19Mayeur G.L.

In this study we set out to analyze the mechanism of AR nuclear export by developing an in vitro assay based on digitonin-permeabilized LNCaP cells. Using this assay, we found that short double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotides stimulated robust AR export in an ATP-dependent reaction. Okadaic acid (OA) modestly enhanced the reaction and promoted the phosphorylation of exported AR. Significantly, both AR export and phosphorylation were prevented by chemical inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase family, including an inhibitor that is specific for DNA-PK. We also found that an export factor, exportin 5, can stimulate AR export in permeabilized cells independently of DNA-PK. These findings together with our previous work showing that mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate AR export (27Gioeli D. Black B.E. Gordon V. Spencer A. Kesler C.T. Eblen S.T. Paschal B.M. Weber M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) lead us to conclude that AR uses multiple pathways to exit the nucleus. We propose that kinases, including p38, JNK, and DNA-PK, can regulate AR export, possibly by providing AR with a “license” to exit the nucleus. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells (28Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Kawinski E. Karr J.P. Rosenthal H. Chu T.M. Mirand E.A. Murphy G.P. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 1809-1818PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in T medium (Invitrogen) containing phenol red and 5% fetal bovine serum. The GFP-AR plasmid used for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis and single-cell export assays encodes an N-terminally GFP-tagged form of human AR in a pEGFP-C1 vector backbone (Clontech). LNCaP cells were transfected using transfectin (Bio-Rad). Recombinant Protein Preparation Exportin 5—A pQE60 plasmid (Qiagen) encoding C-terminally His-tagged human exportin 5 (Addgene plasmid 12553) was transformed into the TG1 bacterial strain. Following growth to log phase in LB medium with 2% ethanol, cultures were induced using 300 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 25 °C. Cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Resuspension and wash buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Following three rounds of lysis using a French press, lysates were clarified and incubated with Talon beads (Clontech) at 4 °C for ≥2 h. Talon resin was washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole, and then with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole. Recombinant exportin 5 was eluted using 20 mm HEPES, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 250 mm imidazole before dialysis into 1× transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA) supplemented with 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Exportin 5 was snap-frozen in single-use aliquots. GST-DBD-Hinge—A pGEX4T3 vector (GE Healthcare) encoding a fragment of AR that includes the DBD and hinge domains (residues 549–671) was transformed into BL21 cells. Following growth to log phase, protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the presence of 2% ethanol for 3 h at room temperature. Pelleted cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors. Following French press-mediated lysis, lysates were clarified and incubated with glutathione beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The bound fraction was washed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, then washed with PBS containing 500 mm NaCl, and then washed with PBS alone. GST-AR-DBD-Hinge protein was eluted with 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm glutathione, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Dialysis into 1× transport buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 1 mm DTT preceded snap freezing in singleuse aliquots. In Vitro AR Export Assay—The assay was based on selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane of cultured cells with digitonin, an approach used to study protein import and export mechanisms (29Love D.C. Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). LNCaP cells expressing endogenous AR were supplied with 1–10 nm synthetic androgen (R1881; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1–3 h prior to a wash with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Cells were subjected to a brief trypsinization (0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen)) that was quenched with serum-containing medium, then subjected to gentle centrifugation (∼200 × g) before resuspension in ice-cold 1× transport buffer. Cells were permeabilized on ice for 6–8 min with 50 μg/ml high purity digitonin (Calbiochem) in ice-cold complete transport buffer (CTB: 1× TB containing 2 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin). Cells were then washed with ice-cold CTB and aliquoted into standard polystyrene tubes commonly used for DNA transfection (Falcon 352058). Ice-cold export reaction mixes were added to aliquots of permeabilized cells on ice. Final reaction volume was ∼125 μl (100-μl reaction mix and 25-μl cell suspension); final permeabilized cell concentration in each reaction was ∼5 × 106 cells/ml. The tubes containing the permeabilized cells and reaction mixes were incubated at 30 °C for 20–30 min. Following the incubation, reaction components were centrifuged (∼18,000 × g for 12 min) to isolate the reaction supernatant (containing the exported AR fraction) from the cell pellet (containing the nonexported, nuclear AR). Equal volumes of reaction supernatants were then separated on 7.5% acrylamide SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following SDS-PAGE separation, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted using the polyclonal α-AR antibody PG-21 (directed against the N-terminal 21 amino acid residues of AR (Upstate)), providing a semi-quantitative measure of the amount of AR exported during the assay. Comparison of the exported fractions with cell pellets (nuclei) in multiple experiments established that equivalent numbers of permeabilized cells were dispensed and recovered under different conditions and that on average ∼40% of LNCaP AR was exported in a 30-min reaction (data not shown). In vitro export assays conducted in the presence of CTB alone served as negative control for AR export. Our energy-regenerating system (ERS) consisted of bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml final in export reaction), creatine phosphokinase (80 units/ml final), creatine phosphate (1.6 mg/ml final), ATP (1 mm final), GTP (1 mm final), and aprotinin. Nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs AMP-PNP and GMP-PNP were also used at 1 mm final concentration. Okadaic acid (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 200 nm. Casodex (10 μm; Fisher), wortmannin (20 μm (MP Biomedicals)), LY294002 (50 μm (Calbiochem)), and NU7026 (2.5 μm (Sigma)) were added to LNCaP cells 1–2 h prior to the start of the in vitro export assay. Chemical inhibitors were routinely maintained in pre-export wash buffers and in export reactions. For export assays in the absence of agonist, cells were washed with phenol red-free RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 5% charcoal-stripped serum, and then incubated in this medium for 6–24 h prior to permeabilization and in vitro export assays. For phosphatase treatment of exported AR, export reactions were first carried out in the presence of ERS, OA, and ARE (1 μm). Following centrifugation, the export supernatants (36 μl) were treated with Antarctic phosphatase (10 units; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of the manufacturer's supplied buffer (final 1× concentration). Reaction components were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and AR was immunoblotted with the PG-21 antibody. For in vitro export assays using [3H]R1881, LNCaP cells were incubated in the presence of 2 nm [3H]R1881 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1–3 h prior to washing and cell permeabilization. In vitro export reactions ensued at 30 °C for 30 min. Reaction supernatants containing the exported AR fraction were then collected, applied to Whatman paper, dried, and measured by scintillation counting. For immunoprecipitations, reaction supernatants were incubated with control resin or AR-21 anti-AR resin in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4 °C. Resins were washed five times in complete transport buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to release of bound [3H]R1881 with 2% SDS at 90 °C for 10 min. Released fractions were applied to Whatman paper, dried, and measured by scintillation counting. For in vitro export assays followed by detergent extraction, LNCaP cells were subjected to standard export reactions prior to centrifugation and harvest of reaction supernatants containing the exported AR fraction. Cell pellets containing residual, nonexported AR were then subjected to extraction with 0.5% Triton X-100 in complete transport buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml final), glycerol (0.5% final), and aprotinin, for 20 min on ice. Subsequent centrifugation yielded supernatant (detergent-sensitive) and pellet (detergent-resistant) fractions. In Fig. 6C (Triton in the Export Rxn samples), 0.5% Triton X-100 was included during standard export reactions to disrupt the nuclear envelope and yielded a single released AR fraction. Recombinant exportin 5 was used at a final concentration of 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml. Dialysis buffer obtained from the preparation of recombinant exportin 5 served as negative control in the export reactions. For in vitro AR export in adherent cells, LNCaP cells were plated on glass coverslips (Fisher) coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and grown in T medium containing phenol red and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Following treatment with 10 nm R1881, cells were washed three times (4 min/wash) with ice-cold TB, permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin in ice-cold CTB for 6–8 min, and then washed again three times with ice-cold CTB. Export reaction mixes were supplied to the cells before incubation at 30 °C for 20–30 min. Cells were washed two more times with ice-cold CTB prior to fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde. In antibody access experiments to test the integrity of the nuclear envelope during in vitro export assays, an antibody to the nuclear protein RCC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the export reaction mix (7 μg/ml final). As a positive control for envelope disruption, 0.2% Triton X-100 was also included in the export reaction. Following the export assay, washes, and fixation, cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and subjected to standard immunofluorescence processing using an anti-AR primary antibody (AR-21) and secondary antibodies to both the anti-RCC1 and anti-AR primary antibodies. Cells were mounted and viewed using a Nikon Eclipse E800 upright microscope. DNA Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides used to stimulate AR export in vitro are from Sigma Genosys. The ARE duplex (duplex a, see Fig. 7A) contains both half-sites of the ARE in the C(3)1 intron of the prostatic binding protein gene (30Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mutant ARE duplex (duplex b) contains four point mutations within the 12-residue positions comprising the tandem of ARE half-sites (30Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides c and d are the sense and antisense strand components, respectively, of the wild-type ARE duplex (duplex a). Duplexes f–h are derivatives of the wild-type ARE duplex. In duplex i, the two ARE half-sites are separated by a noncomplementary bubble, 12 residues in length on each duplex strand. In oligonucleotide j, the upstream ARE half-site is adjoined to a 13-nucleotide noncomplementary loop (see Fig. 7A for schematic representations of these oligonucleotides). The NRE duplex is a derivative of the ARE duplex and harbors an NRE1 sequence (26Giffin W. Kwast-Welfeld J. Rodda D.J. Prefontaine G.G. Traykova-Andonova M. Zhang Y. Weigel N.L. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5647-5658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) instead of an ARE. The ARE-NRE duplex contains an NRE1 sequence and an ARE in cis. NS1, NS2, and NS3 are intended as nonspecific duplexes that harbor neither an ARE nor an NRE1 sequence. FRAP Analysis and AR Export in Single Cells—LNCaP cells were grown on Delta T dishes (Fisher) coated with poly-d-lysine. Following expression of GFP-AR, cells were treated with R1881 and subjected to standard permeabilization and washes with complete transport buffer on ice. Cells were then placed on a Bioptechs stage warmer, and GFP-AR-expressing cells were identified using the wide field mode of a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope, and export reaction mixes were added to cells. For single-cell export assays, nuclear GFP fluorescence intensity was recorded immediately prior to and immediately following a 30-min export reaction at 37 °C. The ratio of these two values (plotted in Fig. 4D) provides a measure of nuclear GFP fluorescence lost, and therefore of GFP-AR nuclear export, during the reaction. For FRAP measurements, recovery of GFP fluorescence into the photobleached area was monitored in increments of 2.5 min. Recovery curves represent the ratio of the fluorescence intensity within the photobleached rectangular area to the nuclear fluorescence intensity outside this photobleached area plotted as a function of time. Following addition of an export reaction mix, up to six recovery curves per dish were generated sequentially, each in a separate cell. All recovery curves for a given export reaction condition were averaged, and a representative recovery curve is plotted for each condition in Fig. 4B. The t½ value (Table 1) indicates the time at which the half-maximal amount of fluorescence recovery into the photobleached area has occurred, under a given reaction condition.TABLE 1Reaction conditiont½Mobile AR fractionExported AR fractions%%Buffer15.8 ± 2.140 ± 50 ± 12ERS51.0 ± 8.336 ± 36 ± 5ARE25.6 ± 5.146 ± 438 ± 7ERS/ARE26.3 ± 2.559 ± 355 ± 5ERS/OA/ARE24.7 ± 5.643 ± 564 ± 4 Open table in a new tab DNA Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide sequences are as follows: duplex a, sense, GGGAGCTTACATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGGTCGA, and antisense, TCTCGACCTTGAGAACATCACGTACTATGTAAGCT; duplex b (residues mutated relative to duplex a are in boldface), sense, GGGAGCTTACATTGTTCTTGAGGTTCTCAAGGTCGA, and antisense, TCTCGACCTTGAGAACCTCAAGAACAATGTAAGCT; oligonucleotide c (identical to the sense strand of duplex a), GGGAGCTTACATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGGTCGA; oligonucleotide d (identical to the antisense strand of duplex a), TCTCGACCTTGAGAACATCACGTACTATGTAAGCT; duplex e, sense, AGCTTACATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGGTCGACT, and antisense, TCGACCTTGAGAACATCACGTACTATGTAAGCTGGG; duplex f, sense, GGGAGCTTACATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGGTCGACT, and antisense, TCTCGACCTTGAGAACATCACGTACTATGTAAGCTGGG; duplex g, sense, GGGAGCTTACATAGTACGTGATGTTCTCAAGGTCGAGA, and antisense, TCTCGACCTTGAGAACATCACGTACTATGTAAGCTCCC; duplex h, sense, CATAGTACGTGACCCCCCCCCCCCTGATGTTCTCAA, and antisense, TTGAGAACATCACCCCCCCCCCCCTCACGTACTATG; oligonucleotide i, CATAGTACGTGACCCCCCCCCCCCTCACGTACTATG; and duplex j, sense.

The fluorescent ARE duplex used in Fig. 1C contains a fluorescein moiety on the 5′ end of the antisense strand of the wild-type ARE duplex (duplex a). Real Time RT PCR—Real time RT PCR analysis was done on an iCycler optical system (Bio-Rad) using the IQ SYBR Green PCR master mix. LNCaP cells were pretreated with NU7026 for 16 h and then the cells were untreated or treated with 1 nm R1881 for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). DNase I treatment was performed directly on the RNeasy mini column with 27 Kunitz units of DNase I (Qiagen) for 15 min at room temperature according to the Qiagen protocol. RNA was quantified using Ribogreen (Molecular Probes). 500 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction volume using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The human-specific PCR primers used were as follows: forward PSA, 5′-TGGTGCATTACCGGAAAGTGGATCA-3′, and reverse PSA 5′-GCTTGAGTCTTGGCCTGGTCATTTC-3′; forward S100P, 5′-ATGACGGAACTAGAGACAGCC-3′, and reverse S100P 5′-AGGAAGCCTGGTAGCTCCTT-3′; forward FKBP51, 5′-CATCAAGGCATGGGACATTGG-3′, and reverse FKBP51 5′-TCGAGGGAATTTTAGGGAGACT-3′; forward PDF, 5′-GGGCAAGAATCTCAGGACGG-3′, and reverse PDF 5′-TCTGGAGTCTTCGGAGTGCAA-3′; and forward β-glucuronidase, 5′-CCGACTTCTCTGACAACCGACG-3′, and reverse β-glucuronidase, 5′-AGCCGACAAAATGCCGCAGACG-3′. Nonreversed transcribed RNA was subject to PCR as a control; no DNA contamination was observed.

https://openalex.org/W2012543937,"Solution structures of complexes between the isolated A (IIA(Man)) and B (IIB(Man)) domains of the cytoplasmic component of the mannose transporter of Escherichia coli have been solved by NMR. The complex of wild-type IIA(Man) and IIB(Man) is a mixture of two species comprising a productive, phosphoryl transfer competent complex and a non-productive complex with the two active site histidines, His-10 of IIA(Man) and His-175 of IIB(Man), separated by approximately 25A. Mutation of the active site histidine, His-10, of IIA(Man) to a glutamate, to mimic phosphorylation, results in the formation of a single productive complex. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of both wild-type and H10E IIA(Man) to IIB(Man) are approximately the same (K(D) approximately 0.5 mM). The productive complex can readily accommodate a transition state involving a pentacoordinate phosphoryl group with trigonal bipyramidal geometry bonded to the Nepsilon2 atom of His-10 of IIA(Man) and the Ndelta1 atom of His-175 of IIB(Man) with negligible (<0.2A) local backbone conformational changes in the immediate vicinity of the active site. The non-productive complex is related to the productive one by a approximately 90 degrees rotation and approximately 37A translation of IIB(Man) relative to IIA(Man), leaving the active site His-175 of IIB(Man) fully exposed to solvent in the non-productive complex. The interaction surface on IIA(Man) for the non-productive complex comprises a subset of residues used in the productive complex and in both cases involves both subunits of IIA(Man). The selection of the productive complex by IIA(Man)(H10E) can be attributed to neutralization of the positively charged Arg-172 of IIB(Man) at the center of the interface. The non-productive IIA(Man)-IIB(Man) complex may possibly be relevant to subsequent phosphoryl transfer from His-175 of IIB(Man) to the incoming sugar located on the transmembrane IIC(Man)-IID(Man) complex."

https://openalex.org/W2081694107,"Functional RNAs (fRNAs) are being recognized as an important regulatory component in biological processes. Interestingly, recent computational studies suggest that the number and biological significance of functional RNAs within coding regions (coding fRNAs) may have been underestimated. We hypothesized that such coding fRNAs will impose additional constraint on sequence evolution because the DNA primary sequence has to simultaneously code for functional RNA secondary structures on the messenger RNA in addition to the amino acid codons for the protein sequence. To test this prediction, we first utilized computational methods to predict conserved fRNA secondary structures within multiple species alignments of Saccharomyces sensu strico genomes. We predict that as much as 5% of the genes in the yeast genome contain at least one functional RNA secondary structure within their protein-coding region. We then analyzed the impact of coding fRNAs on the evolutionary rate of protein-coding genes because a decrease in evolutionary rate implies constraint due to biological functionality. We found that our predicted coding fRNAs have a significant influence on evolutionary rates (especially at synonymous sites), independent of other functional measures. Thus, coding fRNA may play a role on sequence evolution. Given that coding regions of humans and flies contain many more predicted coding fRNAs than yeast, the impact of coding fRNAs on sequence evolution may be substantial in genomes of higher eukaryotes."
