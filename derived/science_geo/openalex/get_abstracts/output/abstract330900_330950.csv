https://openalex.org/W2068709854,"The preliminary analysis of data from the Pioneer 10 S-band radio occultation experinment has revealed the presence of an ionosphere on the Jovian satellite Io (JI) having an electron density peak of about 6 x 10(4) electrons per cubic centimeter at an altitude of approximately 60 to 140 kilometers. This suggests the presence of an atmosphere having a surface number density of about 10(10) to 10(12) per cubic centimeter, corresponding to an atmospheric surface pressure of between 10(-8) and 10(-10) bar, at or below the detection threshold of the Beta Scorpii stellar occultation. A measurement of the atmosphere of Jupiter was obtained down to the level of about 80 millibars, indicating a large temperature increase at about the 20 millibar level, which cannot be explained by the absorption of solar radiation by methane alone and can possibly be due to absorption by particulate matter."
https://openalex.org/W2002836755,"A two-channel ultraviolet photometer aboard Pioneer 10 has made several observations of the ultraviolet glow in the wavelength range from 170 to 1400 angstroms in the vicinity of Jupiter. Preliminary results indicate a Jovian hydrogen (1216 angstrom) glow with a brightness of about 1000 rayleighs and a helium (584 angstrom) glow with a brightness of about 10 to 20 rayleighs. In addition, Jupiter appears to have an extensive hydrogen torus surrounding it in the orbital plane of Io. The mean diameter of the torus is about equal to the diameter of the orbit of Io. Several observations of the Galilean satellites have also occurred but only a rather striking Io observation has been analyzed to date. If the observed Io glow is predominantly that of Lyman-alpha, the surface brightness is about 10,000 rayleighs."

https://openalex.org/W2013024138,"Seismic waves reflected as many as four times within Earth's outer core are routinely recorded from large earthquakes. Observations of these waves are confined to rays near grazing incidence on the core-mantle boundary, in agreement with theoretical expectation. Minor adjustments to outer-core velocities may be necessary to account for certain of these arrivals that are not predicted by present core models. A change of 10 kilometers or more in the currently accepted core radius, 3473 kilometers, is not corroborated by the new data."

These results indicate that olfactory information has been retained for 18 months, the period between smolting and the homeward migration."
https://openalex.org/W2031856979,"A 2.5-centimeter telescope aboard Pioneer 10 is capable of making two-dimensional spin-scan maps of intensity and polarization in red and blue light at high spatial resolution. During the recent flyby of Jupiter, a large quantity of imaging and polarimetric data was obtained on Jupiter and the Galilean satellites over a wide range of phase angles."

https://openalex.org/W1982051136,"Preliminary analyses of Doppler data from Pioneer 10 during its encounter with Jupiter indicate that the mass of Io is about 20 percent greater than previously thought and that Io's mean density is about 3.5 grams per cubic centimeter. A determination of the dynamical flattening of Jupiter (a - b)/a (where a is the semimajor axis and b is the semiminor axis) is found to lie in the neighborhood of 0.065, which agrees with the value determined from satellite perturbations."

https://openalex.org/W2029893801,The spatial concentration and size distribution for particles measured by the asteroid/meteoroid detector on Pioneer 10 between 2 and 3.5 astronomical units are presented. The size distribution is from about 35 micrometers to 10 centimeters. The exponent of the size dependence varies from approximately -1.7 for the smallest to approximately -3.0 for the largest size measured.
https://openalex.org/W2034472686,"Data on interplanetary and near-Jupiter micrometer-sized particle encounters from the meteoroid-detection experiment on Pioneer 10 indicate that Jupiter is much 'dustier' than interplanetary space. Whereas the near-earth particulate flux showed very little increase over the interplanetary flux, the near-Jupiter penetration flux was over two orders of magnitude higher than the interplanetary flux."
