Here, we used a novel algorithm to systematically identify BGCs in the extensive extant microbial sequencing data. Network analysis of the predicted BGCs revealed large gene cluster families, the vast majority uncharacterized. We experimentally characterized the most prominent family, consisting of two subfamilies of hundreds of BGCs distributed throughout the Proteobacteria; their products are aryl polyenes, lipids with an aryl head group conjugated to a polyene tail. We identified a distant relationship to a third subfamily of aryl polyene BGCs, and together the three subfamilies represent the largest known family of biosynthetic gene clusters, with more than 1,000 members. Although these clusters are widely divergent in sequence, their small molecule products are remarkably conserved, indicating for the first time the important roles these compounds play in Gram-negative cell biology.

Microbial natural products are widely used in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and manufacturing, and are known to mediate a variety of microbe-host and microbe-microbe interactions. Connecting these natural products to the genes that encode them is revolutionizing their study, enabling genome sequence data to guide the discovery of new molecules (Bergmann et al., 2007Bergmann S.

The thousands of prokaryotic genomes in sequence databases provide an opportunity to generalize this approach through the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs): sets of physically clustered genes that encode the biosynthetic enzymes for a natural product pathway. Besides core biosynthetic enzymes, many BGCs also harbor enzymes to synthesize specialized monomers for a pathway. For example, the erythromycin gene cluster encodes a set of enzymes for biosynthesis of two deoxysugars, d-desosamine and l-mycarose, that are appended to the polyketide aglycone (Oliynyk et al., 2007Oliynyk M.

Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1565-1573PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, transporters, regulatory elements, and genes that mediate host resistance are also contained within the BGC (Walsh and Fischbach, 2010Walsh C.T.

Although some BGCs are so well understood that the biosynthesis of their small molecule product has been reconstituted in heterologous hosts (Pfeifer et al., 2001Pfeifer B.A. Admiraal S.J. Gramajo H.

Total biosynthesis: in vitro reconstitution of polyketide and nonribosomal peptide pathways.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2008; 25: 757-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), little is known about the vast majority of BGCs, even those that have been connected to a small molecule product. Here, we report the results of a systematic effort to identify and categorize BGCs in 1,154 sequenced genomes spanning the prokaryotic tree of life. We envisioned that the resulting “global map” of biosynthesis would enable BGCs to be systematically selected for characterization by searching for, e.g., biosynthetic novelty, presence in undermined taxa, or patterns of phylogenetic distribution that indicate functional importance. Surprisingly, the map revealed large and very widely distributed BGC families of unknown function. We experimentally characterized the most prominent of these families, leading to the unexpected finding that gene clusters responsible for producing aryl polyene carboxylic acids constitute the largest BGC family in the sequence databases. Several algorithms have been developed for the automated prediction of BGCs in microbial genomes (Khaldi et al., 2010Khaldi N. Seifuddin F.T. Turner G. Haft D. Nierman W.C. Wolfe K.H. Fedorova N.D.

Biotechnol. 2009; 140: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), but each of these tools is limited to the detection of one or more well-characterized gene cluster classes. As a more general solution to the gene cluster identification problem, we developed a hidden Markov model-based probabilistic algorithm, ClusterFinder, that aims to identify gene clusters of both known and unknown classes. ClusterFinder is based on a training set of 732 BGCs with known small molecule products that we compiled and manually curated (Table S1). To scan a genome for BGCs, it converts a nucleotide sequence into a string of contiguous Pfam domains and assigns each domain a probability of being part of a gene cluster, based on the frequencies at which these domains occur in the BGC and non-BGC training sets, and the identities of neighboring domains (Figure 1A, Experimental Procedures). Since ClusterFinder is based solely on Pfam domain frequencies, and nature uses distinct assemblages of the same enzyme superfamilies to construct unrelated natural product classes, ClusterFinder exhibits relatively little training set bias and is capable of identifying new classes of gene clusters effectively (See Experimental Procedures for a detailed description of how we validated ClusterFinder). Our method predicted a total of 33,351 putative BCGs (with an estimated false-positive rate of 5%) in 1,154 genomes of organisms throughout the prokaryotic tree of life (Figures 1C And 1D, see also Extended Results Section Systematic Identification of Gene Clusters from Bacterial Genomes); we subjected these putative BGCs to an extensive phylogenomic analysis (Extended Results Sections Prolific Producers Harbor Exceptionally Large Complements of Gene Clusters and The Relationship between Phylogeny and Gene Clusters Varies Tremendously across the Bacterial Tree of Life, Figures S1A–S1D, S2, S3, Tables S1 and S2 available online). We divided the predicted BGCs into two categories—high confidence (10,724; used in all subsequent analyses) and low confidence (22,627)—based on assignment to one of ∼20 well-validated BGC classes or on manual inspection for clusters that could not be assigned to any known class. Within the high-confidence set, 7,377 of the predicted gene clusters (69%) were not detected by antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2013Blin K. Medema M.H. Kazempour D. Fischbach M.A. Breitling R. Takano E.

Strikingly, 40% of all predicted BGCs encode saccharides, more than twice the size of the next largest class. Notably, only 13% of previously reported BGCs encode the biosynthesis of saccharides (Extended Results Section Saccharides Are the Largest Class of Gene Clusters). Ninety-three percent of species harbor saccharide gene clusters, and in 33% of species, more than half of the predicted gene clusters encode saccharides. Cell-associated saccharides such as lipopolysaccharides (Park et al., 2009Park B.S. Song D.H. Kim H.M. Choi B.S. Lee H. Lee J.O. The structural basis of lipopolysaccharide recognition by the TLR4-MD-2 complex.Nature. 2009; 458: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), capsular polysaccharides (Kadioglu et al., 2008Kadioglu A.

Biol. 2001; 8: 569-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The functions of many of the putative saccharide BGCs are still a mystery: 32%, including BGCs from entirely unexplored genera, are not closely related to any known gene cluster (Figure S1E). Saccharide BGC repertoires are also surprisingly diverse: only 37% occur in the genomes of two species chosen at random from the same genus (compared to 43% for polyketides, 60% for terpenoids, and 74% for fatty acids, Figure S1F). The abundance of novel oligosaccharide BGC families raises the possibility that more clinically relevant saccharides such as the antidiabetic drug acarbose and the antibiotics gentamicin and avilamycin will be discovered (Kersten et al., 2013Kersten R.D. Ziemert N. Gonzalez D.J. Duggan B.M. Nizet V. Dorrestein P.C. Moore B.S. Glycogenomics as a mass spectrometry-guided genome-mining method for microbial glycosylated molecules.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E4407-E4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another BGC class of unexpectedly large size is the ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs; Arnison et al., 2013Arnison P.G. Bibb M.J. Bierbaum G. Bowers A.A. Bugni T.S. Bulaj G. Camarero J.A. Campopiano D.J. Challis G.L. Clardy J. et al.Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide natural products: overview and recommendations for a universal nomenclature.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2013; 30: 108-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Notably, RiPP BGCs are as prevalent in our data set as those encoding nonribosomal peptides (Figure 1B). We next sought to study the relationships among BGCs systematically, with the ultimate goal of creating a global BGC map that could be searched systematically to identify clusters of biosynthetic or taxonomic interest. We adapted a measure of the evolutionary distance between multidomain proteins (Lin et al., 2006Lin K. Zhu L. Zhang D.Y. An initial strategy for comparing proteins at the domain architecture level.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) to calculate an all-by-all distance matrix for the 10,724 BGCs in our high-confidence set along with the 732 members of our training set. Using MCL clustering to identify groups of related nodes, we define 905 BGC families with distinct core genetic components. The resulting BGC distance network (Figure 2, see Extended Results Section A Global Map of Biosynthesis Based on a Gene Cluster Distance Metric, and Figure S4) revealed an unexpected finding: the presence of large cliques that represent very widely distributed BGC families without any experimentally characterized members.Figure S4BGC Similarity Networks, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Similarity network of known BGCs. The similarities between the BGCs were calculated by taking into account the architecture as well as the sequence similarity features of our distance metric (see Methods for details). This analysis shows that the gene cluster distance metric functions well in separating known families of BGCs, while maintaining links representing known genetic similarities between classes like aminoglycosides and saccharides. Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011Smoot M.E. Ono K. Ruscheinski J. Wang P.L. Ideker T.

Parameters were calculated using the NetworkX library. While most known families of secondary metabolites are unique to a small set of organisms, a few are taxonomically widespread. These include the O-antigens, capsular polysaccharides, carotenoids, and NRPS-independent siderophores, which can all be clearly distinguished as prominent cliques within our distance network. From a fundamental microbiological perspective, these are among the most important families of molecules produced by microbes and, as such, they have been very intensively studied (Challis, 2005Challis G.L.

Although we had anticipated finding small gene cluster families of unknown function, we were surprised to discover families harboring hundreds of uncharacterized clusters, distributed widely throughout entire bacterial phyla. We selected the most prominent of these families for experimental characterization: a set of 811 BGCs, distributed between two subfamilies (hereafter, subfamily 1 and 2), that were not detected by any of the existing BGC identification tools (e.g., antiSMASH), likely because the ketosynthase and adenylation domains they harbor are from uncharacterized, evolutionarily distant clades.

Lassen K.G. Xavier R.J. Advances in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: linking host genetics and the microbiome.Gut. 2013; 62: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). For a growing number of diseases, an altered microbiome is not just a marker of disease, but also actively contributes to pathology (Chassaing et al., 2012Chassaing B. Aitken J.D. Gewirtz A.T. Vijay-Kumar M. Gut microbiota drives metabolic disease in immunologically altered mice.Adv. Immunol. 2012; 116: 93-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The best empirical direct evidence that microbiomes can drive disease comes from experiments in which the microbiota from diseased donors and controls are “transplanted” into healthy germ-free hosts: if recipients of the disease-associated microbiome display the disease phenotype, the microbiome is considered causal. This approach, pioneered by Jeffrey Gordon and his group (Turnbaugh et al., 2006Turnbaugh P.J. Ley R.E. Mahowald M.A. Magrini V. Mardis E.R. Gordon J.I. An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest.Nature. 2006; 444: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (6916) Google Scholar), has directly demonstrated that the composition of gut microbial communities can alter host metabolism (Koren et al., 2012Koren O.

Ley R.E. Volchkov P.Y. Stranges P.B. Avanesyan L. Stonebraker A.C. Hu C. Wong F.S. Szot G.L. Bluestone J.A. et al.Innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in the development of Type 1 diabetes.Nature. 2008; 455: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). The range of conditions with a host-microbiome interaction component continues to grow and has recently started to include neurological conditions (Collins et al., 2012Collins S.M. Surette M. Bercik P. The interplay between the intestinal microbiota and the brain.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Consequently, researchers from a wide array of disciplines are interested in testing whether microbes, and especially gut microbes, are associated with various pathologies, whether they actively participate in disease, and ultimately whether they can present novel targets for therapies. This Primer is intended for non-experts who are considering their first microbiome project and summarizes lessons learned from past successful and unsuccessful projects. Mammalian microbiome research has a long history (Savage, 1977Savage D.C. Microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 107-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar), recently marked by dramatic increases in scale and scope due to advances in DNA-sequencing technologies and in associated computational methods. Anecdotal descriptions of community composition that set the standard in the recent past have given way to study designs that allow for repeated measurements, error estimates, correlations of microbiota with covariates, and increasingly sophisticated statistical tests (Knight et al., 2012Knight R. Jansson J. Field D. Fierer N. Desai N. Fuhrman J.A. Hugenholtz P. van der Lelie D. Meyer F. Stevens R. et al.Unlocking the potential of metagenomics through replicated experimental design.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Today, microbiome data are obtained predominantly in three forms: (1) 16S rRNA gene sequence surveys that provide a view of microbiome membership, (2) metagenomic data used to portray functional potential, and (3) metatranscriptomic data to describe active gene expression. Here, we focus primarily on 16S rRNA gene surveys because they are economical and therefore scale to larger projects. 16S rRNA gene sequence data provide a relatively unbiased characterization of bacterial and archaeal diversity (Box 1 provides a brief overview of methods for characterizing the diversity of microbial eukaryotes and viruses). Regardless of the types of microorganisms targeted or the methodology used to characterize them, choices made at every step, from study design to analysis, can impact results. This Primer highlights resources that address specific technical questions and provides general advice stemming from our collective experience working in the field. Although we focus mainly on the mammalian gut microbiota, many of the same issues apply to microbial communities of other habitats. We have structured the Primer to answer questions that are commonly raised by researchers entering the field (Figure 1).Box 1Archaeal, Viral, and Eukaryotic DiversityMost studies of the human microbiota describe bacterial diversity, which typically dominates the cellular fraction of the microbiota; but other taxa, including Archaea, fungi, and other microbial eukaryotes, and viruses can be present.Archaea. Archaeal diversity can be characterized using the commonly employed 515F/806R primer set (and others), and their diversity can be analyzed in the same way as bacterial diversity. The 16S rRNA gene is the most widely used marker gene for the Archaea, and their diversity is represented in reference data sets commonly used for Bacteria.Microbial Eukaryotes. Characterization of fungal communities, in particular, is an active research area. In principle, the bioinformatics pipeline is the same for eukaryotic marker genes as for bacterial marker genes (Iliev et al., 2012Iliev I.D. Funari V.A. Taylor K.D. Nguyen Q. Reyes C.N. Strom S.P. Brown J. Becker C.A. Fleshner P.R. Dubinsky M. et al.Interactions between commensal fungi and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-1 influence colitis.Science. 2012; 336: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). However, the lack of a standard marker gene and reference database means that the bioinformatics protocols are not as standardized as for 16S rRNA gene analysis. For fungi, although several marker gene options exist, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 16S rRNA gene is generally preferred for obtaining high taxonomic resolution. The UNITE database (Abarenkov et al., 2010Abarenkov K. Henrik Nilsson R. Larsson K.H. Alexander I.J. Eberhardt U. Erland S. Høiland K. Kjøller R. Larsson E. Pennanen T. et al.The UNITE database for molecular identification of fungi—recent updates and future perspectives.New Phytol. 2010; 186: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) is often used for ITS sequence-based analyses of fungal sequences. However, the ITS region is not amenable to alignments across distinct fungal taxa, so ITS-based fungal community studies frequently do not make use of phylogenetic metrics for alpha- and beta-diversity comparisons. One strategy that is being explored is using the 18S rRNA gene and ITS in conjunction to define fungal phylogenetic trees. Moreover, the 18S rRNA gene can, in principle, be used to analyze eukaryotic communities in the same manner that 16S rRNA genes are used. A reference database containing many eukaryotic sequences, such as SILVA (Quast et al., 2013Quast C. Pruesse E. Yilmaz P. Gerken J. Schweer T. Yarza P. Peplies J. Glöckner F.O. The SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project: improved data processing and web-based tools.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: D590-D596Crossref PubMed Scopus (9211) Google Scholar), should be used for such analyses. One should confirm that the region of the 18S gene amplified discriminates between the taxa studied and should be aware that the 18S rRNA gene is not sufficient to characterize the eukaryotic phylogeny: trees built from 18S sequence alone will likely be of questionable utility.Viruses. Characterizing the human virome requires a different approach because, unlike for cellular life, no gene or genomic region is homologous across all viruses. The current approach for studying these communities is to isolate virus-like particles (VLPs) using size fractionation and to sequence those using metagenomics (Caporaso et al., 2011aCaporaso J.G.

Hegyi H. et al.Panmicrobial oligonucleotide array for diagnosis of infectious diseases.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2007; 13: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A large fraction of microbiome studies are conducted in animals, particularly rodents, as they offer attractive models for human biology and their environmental conditions can be tightly controlled. How animals are bred and raised is the most important source of confounding factors in microbiome studies conducted in animals. Inoculation of mice at birth (the maternal effect) is a major factor shaping the composition of the microbiota and leads to a sharing of suites of bacteria between littermates and their mothers that differentiates them from members of other families and can persist over several generations (Ley et al., 2005Ley R.E. Bäckhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Obesity alters gut microbial ecology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). The maternal effect determines the specific suite of microbes available to colonize a host. Subsequently, the individual host and host diet shapes the relative abundances of these taxa (Ley et al., 2005Ley R.E. Bäckhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Obesity alters gut microbial ecology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar, Rawls et al., 2006Rawls J.F. Mahowald M.A. Ley R.E. Gordon J.I. Reciprocal gut microbiota transplants from zebrafish and mice to germ-free recipients reveal host habitat selection.Cell. 2006; 127: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The maternal effect is particularly problematic when it confounds the experimental effect (see Figure 2 for an example). Because littermates and even co-caged unrelated animals can share microbiotas due to coprophagy and other modes of transmission, randomization of treatments across litters/cages becomes an important aspect of experimental design. When the goal is to compare the effect of different genotypes on the microbiome, the options range from the use of germ-free mice gavaged with the same inoculum to the use of mixed-genotype litters. When these options are not available, alternate approaches include embryo transfers so that mixed genotypes are born together, cross-fostering, and cohousing post weaning. The last two options may be the least effective, as microbiotas will be at least partly assembled. In large studies with multiple litter/cage replicates, the variance in the data that is attributable to the maternal effect can be accounted for in statistical models (Benson et al., 2010Benson A.K. Kelly S.A. Legge R. Ma F. Low S.J. Kim J. Zhang M. Oh P.L. Nehrenberg D. Hua K. et al.Individuality in gut microbiota composition is a complex polygenic trait shaped by multiple environmental and host genetic factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 18933-18938Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In some cases, animals of different genotypes are maintained separately in order to maximize the maternal effect and obtain a strong microbial phenotype (Vaishnava et al., 2011Vaishnava S. Yamamoto M. Severson K.M. Ruhn K.A. Yu X. Koren O. Ley R. Wakeland E.K. Hooper L.V. The antibacterial lectin RegIIIgamma promotes the spatial segregation of microbiota and host in the intestine.Science. 2011; 334: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, Vijay-Kumar et al., 2010Vijay-Kumar M.

Metabolic syndrome and altered gut microbiota in mice lacking Toll-like receptor 5.Science. 2010; 328: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Separately maintained mice can then be cohoused to demonstrate the spread of a microbiota between adults (Lawley et al., 2012Lawley T.D. Clare S. Walker A.W. Stares M.D. Connor T.R. Raisen C. Goulding D. Rad R. Schreiber F. Brandt C. et al.Targeted restoration of the intestinal microbiota with a simple, defined bacteriotherapy resolves relapsing Clostridium difficile disease in mice.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8: e1002995Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Ridaura et al., 2013Ridaura V.K.

Bain J.R. et al.Gut microbiota from twins discordant for obesity modulate metabolism in mice.Science. 2013; 341: 1241214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Conversely, mice can be housed individually to minimize cross-contamination and maintain individual microbiotas (Ley et al., 2005Ley R.E. Bäckhed F. Turnbaugh P. Lozupone C.A. Knight R.D. Gordon J.I. Obesity alters gut microbial ecology.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 11070-11075Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Mouse microbiotas can differ significantly between facilities even if they have identical genotypes (Friswell et al., 2010Friswell M.K. Gika H. Stratford I.J. Theodoridis G. Telfer B. Wilson I.D. McBain A.J. Site and strain-specific variation in gut microbiota profiles and metabolism in experimental mice.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Environmental conditions can differ between facilities—for instance, the water acidity, food, bedding, and so on can differ. But it appears that different colonies harbor their own populations of microbes as well. One striking example of this facility effect is that of the segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which have been reported more common in mice obtained from one common vendor (JAX) than another (Taconic) (Ivanov et al., 2009Ivanov I.I. Atarashi K. Manel N. Brodie E.L. Shima T. Karaoz U. Wei D. Goldfarb K.C. Santee C.A. Lynch S.V. et al.Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria.Cell. 2009; 139: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Because their impact on the murine immune system is substantial, their presence or absence may confound experimental treatments, particularly in immunological studies. Less is known about the effects of housing regimen (e.g., specific pathogen free [SPF] versus conventional corridors—and note that definitions of SPF differ between facilities). For instance, the microbiota can differ enough between the SPF and conventional areas within facilities to impact the prevalence of certain microbially mediated phenotypes, such as type 1 diabetes in NOD mice (Wen et al., 2008Wen L. Ley R.E. Volchkov P.Y. Stranges P.B. Avanesyan L. Stonebraker A.C. Hu C. Wong F.S. Szot G.L. Bluestone J.A. et al.Innate immunity and intestinal microbiota in the development of Type 1 diabetes.Nature. 2008; 455: 1109-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). In human studies, antibiotics, diet, body mass index, age, pregnancy, and ethnicity all have been reported in the literature to have varying degrees of influence on the microbiota composition of the gut and of other body sites (Costello et al., 2012Costello E.K. Stagaman K. Dethlefsen L. Bohannan B.J. Relman D.A. The application of ecological theory toward an understanding of the human microbiome.Science. 2012; 336: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Some of these factors, notably antibiotic use, have effects strong enough that they are often exclusion criteria (Cho et al., 2012Cho I. Yamanishi S. Cox L. Methé B.A. Zavadil J. Li K. Gao Z. Mahana D. Raju K.

Invest. 2010; 120: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The exclusion criteria list from the NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP, see dbGAP) includes use of systemic antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, or antiparasitics within 6 months of sampling. Each antibiotic can affect the microbiome differently, and microbiome responses to a single antibiotic can also vary substantially between individuals (Dethlefsen et al., 2008Dethlefsen L. Huse S. Sogin M.L. Relman D.A.

Xenobiotics shape the physiology and gene expression of the active human gut microbiome.Cell. 2013; 152: 39-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The 6 month window of exclusion is somewhat arbitrary, however, and in some cases, a shorter window has been applied based on results (Koren et al., 2012Koren O. Goodrich J.K. Cullender T.C. Spor A. Laitinen K. Bäckhed H.K. Gonzalez A. Werner J.J. Angenent L.T. Knight R. et al.Host remodeling of the gut microbiome and metabolic changes during pregnancy.Cell. 2012; 150: 470-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). As in any well-controlled study, factors impacting the microbiota should be balanced across the experimental groups. Selection of subjects can be limited by the demographics of the population available for study. Of course, a carefully selected control group, such as case-matched controls, is preferable to the use of “normal” individuals from another study. In time-series studies, individuals can be treated as their own control by collecting baseline samples before and during treatment (Dethlefsen et al., 2008Dethlefsen L. Huse S. Sogin M.L. Relman D.A. The pervasive effects of an antibiotic on the human gut microbiota, as revealed by deep 16S rRNA sequencing.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e280Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar, Ley et al., 2006Ley R.E. Turnbaugh P.J. Klein S. Gordon J.I. Microbial ecology: human gut microbes associated with obesity.Nature. 2006; 444: 1022-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). In studies that do not include a time series, the best-matched controls are monozygotic twins, in which genotype is constant within twin pairs: for instance, the effect of obesity on the microbiome has been studied in monozygotic co-twins discordant for this phenotype (Smith et al., 2013Smith M.I. Yatsunenko T. Manary M.J. Trehan I. Mkakosya R. Cheng J. Kau A.L. Rich S.S. Concannon P. Mychaleckyj J.C. et al.Gut microbiomes of Malawian twin pairs discordant for kwashiorkor.Science. 2013; 339: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Comparisons between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs are used to differentiate between environmental and genetic contributions to the microbiome, with the assumption that early environmental influences are similar for both twin types. The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) generated the largest human metagenomic study to date (HMPC (Human Microbiome Project Consortium), 2012aHMPC (Human Microbiome Project Consortium)A framework for human microbiome research.Nature. 2012; 486: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, Consortium and Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012bConsortium, H.M.P.; Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumStructure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome.Nature. 2012; 486: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (5676) Google Scholar), with the aim of providing a healthy reference set to be used for comparison in future studies.

Combining new data sets with the HMP is most effective when the protocols are compatible and the effect size (i.e., differences between controls and subjects) of the study is large.

Cheese rind microbial communities represent an experimentally tractable system for defining mechanisms that influence microbial community assembly and function. Although the importance of microbial communities for ecosystem function and human health is becoming increasingly clear (Falkowski et al., 2008Falkowski P.G. Fenchel T. Delong E.F.

The human microbiome: at the interface of health and disease.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar), the task of dissecting the formation and function of these communities remains extremely difficult. Microbial communities are often challenging to manipulate experimentally due to high species diversity, low culturability, and an inability to easily simulate their natural environment (Jessup et al., 2004Jessup C.M. Kassen R. Forde S.E. Kerr B. Buckling A. Rainey P.B. Bohannan B.J. Big questions, small worlds: microbial model systems in ecology.Trends Ecol.

Microbiol. 2003; 57: 369-394Crossref Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). As a result, the mechanisms that underlie the assembly of microbial communities remain poorly characterized (Nemergut et al., 2013Nemergut D.R. Schmidt S.K. Fukami T. O’Neill S.P. Bilinski T.M. Stanish L.F. Knelman J.E. Darcy J.L. Lynch R.C. Wickey P. Patterns and processes of microbial community assembly.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2013; 77: 342-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to advances in the direct study of complex microbial communities in situ, identification and characterization of experimentally tractable model ecosystems could facilitate work toward a mechanistic understanding of community formation in much the same way that the study of model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae has allowed mechanistic insight into molecular and cellular biology. Multispecies microbial communities that form during the production of fermented foods represent one set of potential model ecosystems. Foods such as beer, wine, bread, pickled vegetables, chocolate, and cheese all involve the reproducible metabolism of substrates by microbial communities (as reviewed in Sieuwerts et al., 2008Sieuwerts S. de Bok F.A. Hugenholtz J. van Hylckama Vlieg J.E. Unraveling microbial interactions in food fermentations: from classical to genomics approaches.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 4997-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These communities often form under controlled conditions in discrete units, which allow for the measurement and manipulation of migration into the community, environmental conditions, and growth substrates. Many replicate communities are produced and are easily sampled at various stages, which can allow study of temporal dynamics of community formation. Finally, because these communities are reproducibly cultivated on a known substrate, conditions for isolating community members and recreating community formation in the lab can be designed to closely resemble conditions in situ. In the production of traditionally aged cheeses, a biofilm, commonly known as a rind, forms on the surface of the cheese as it ages (Figures 1 and S1 available online). Previous work has provided a preliminary view of the microbial diversity of rinds from a limited number of artisan cheeses; these rinds are composed of a collection of bacterial and fungal species that come from raw milk, starter cultures added by the cheesemakers, the aging environment, and in some cases, unknown sources (Fox et al., 2004Fox P.F. McSweeney P.L.H. Cogan T.M. Guinee T.P. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology. Volume 1. Academic Press, London2004Google Scholar, Quigley et al., 2013Quigley L. O’Sullivan O. Stanton C. Beresford T.P. Ross R.P. Fitzgerald G.F. Cotter P.D. The complex microbiota of raw milk.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2013; 37: 664-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Rind biofilms have similar properties to the multispecies biofilms that colonize the surfaces of diverse environments (Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004Hall-Stoodley L. Costerton J.W. Stoodley P. Bacterial biofilms: from the natural environment to infectious diseases.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar) and provide an opportunity to study the processes and mechanisms involved in multispecies biofilm formation. Because humans manipulate both stochastic (e.g. dispersal) and deterministic mechanisms (e.g., biotic and abiotic factors) of cheese rind microbial community assembly, we hypothesized that these communities could be developed for the study of microbial diversity in situ and experimental dissection of patterns of diversity in vitro.Figure S1The Production and Aging of Cheese Leads to the Development of Multispecies Communities on the Surface of the Cheese, Related to Figure 1Show full captionRaw milk is obtained from an animal and can either be untreated or pasteurized before being used to make cheese. Milk is made into curds through the addition of rennet and production of acidity by lactic acid bacteria (added as starter cultures or naturally occurring in the milk). Curds are drained and formed into a shape. Salt is added through rubbing the salt on the surface of the cheese or by soaking cheeses in a brine solution. The wheels of cheese are then placed into a cool aging environment (such as a cave) where microbes grow on the surface. Three approaches to aging cheese can lead to the development of different surface communities. Bloomy rind cheeses are heavily inoculated with mold species to develop highly eukaryotic communities.

Potential microbial inputs are highlighted to demonstrate sources of microbes during the production and aging process. Here, we present a large-scale in situ characterization and in vitro reconstruction of the microbial communities from cheese rinds. We use high-throughput sequencing of these multispecies communities to examine taxonomic diversity and functional potential and to reveal temporal patterns of community assembly. We demonstrate that these communities are composed of phylogenetically diverse bacteria and fungi that can be easily cultured. Using a culture-based system that mimics the normal conditions of community formation, in vitro communities can be manipulated based on environmental changes predicted from in situ measurements, coculture experiments reveal widespread bacterial-fungal interactions, and the temporal dynamics of community assembly can be reconstructed using a minimal set of species. Collectively, our work suggests that this system has the potential to bridge in situ and in vitro studies of microbial diversity to better understand the patterns and underlying mechanisms of microbial community assembly and function. Because cheesemaking spans continents and encompasses a variety of cheese styles, widespread sampling of in situ patterns of rind microbial diversity could reveal major factors influencing community formation across geographic and environmental gradients. We used PCR-based amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial and fungal diversity of 137 different cheeses made in 10 different countries across Europe and the United States. For each cheese type, triplicate wheels were sampled (n = 362), and data on sample origin (geography and animal), milk treatment (raw or pasteurized), pH, moisture, and salinity were recorded (Table S1). Across all communities sampled, only 14 bacterial and 10 fungal genera were found at greater than 1% average abundance (Figures 2 and S2 and Table S2A). The number of these dominant genera (those >1% average abundance) per sample is on average 6.5 bacterial genera (range: 1–13) and 3.2 fungal genera (range: 1–7). Given the dominance of a limited number of genera, it might be expected that the majority of the community would originate from starter cultures (Figure S1). However, on average across all samples, we find that at least 60% of the bacteria and 25% of the fungi present are not starter cultures and therefore originate from environmental sources (Table S2A).Figure S2Alpha Diversity of Rind Types and Beta Diversity of Samples, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) A combined table with all OTUs from the bacterial and fungal data sets (>0.005% abundance) was used to calculate rarefaction curves for observed species.

For most uninoculated microbial groups, their function in the context of the community or in the production of cheese is largely unexplored. For example, we identified two bacterial genera, Yaniella and Nocardiopsis, that have never been reported in food microbial ecosystems. We also find that halotolerant γ-Proteobacteria such as Vibrio, Halomonas, and Pseudoalteromonas that are typically associated with marine environments (Holmström and Kjelleberg, 1999Holmström C.

One possible source of these marine microbes is the sea salt used in cheese production, as marine γ-Proteobacteria have been detected both in brine tanks of cheese production facilities (Bokulich and Mills, 2013Bokulich N.A.

Distribution and identification of halophilic bacteria in solar salts produced during entire manufacturing process.Korean J. Microbiol.and Biotech. 2011; 39: 133-139Google Scholar). Many of the 24 dominant genera that we identified are widely distributed across the samples, but their abundance within each rind community is variable (Figure 2). This divergence in community composition is best explained by the rind type of the cheese (washed, bloomy, and natural; PERMANOVA pseudo-F = 16.64, p < 0.001) (Figure 3A), whereas country of origin, milk treatment, or milk source are only weakly associated with community divergence (Figure S3A). These three rind types are a result of three main approaches to aging cheese (Figure S1) (Fox et al., 2004Fox P.F. McSweeney P.L.H. Cogan T.M. Guinee T.P. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology. Volume 1. Academic Press, London2004Google Scholar). Bloomy rind cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert, are heavily inoculated with fungi to create a dense rind that is usually white in appearance (Figure 1A). Natural rind cheeses (Figure 1B), such as clothbound cheddars, St. Nectaire, and Tomme de Savoie, are largely untouched during aging. Washed rind cheeses (Figure 1C), such as Taleggio, Gruyere, and Epoisses, are initially produced in a manner similar to bloomy or natural rind cheeses but are then washed repeatedly during aging with a salt solution. The hybridization of styles in washed rind cheese aging may explain why the composition of these cheeses is interspersed throughout the bloomy and natural rind communities (Figure 3A).Figure S3Dissecting Drivers of Microbial Diversity on Cheese Rinds, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Principal coordinates analysis of amplicon data coded by milk treatment (raw versus pasteurized), country, continent and milk source (type of animal). Separation of rind communities was best explained by rind type, but PERMANOVA also detected significant differences based on raw versus pasteurized (pseudo-F = 6.231, p < 0.001), continent (pseudo-F = 2.966, p < 0.01), and milk source (pseudo-F = 1.923, p < 0.05).(B) Similar rind communities can develop in geographically distant regions, suggesting that rind communities are reproducible phenomena.

In Europe, washed rinds are the only rind type with a significant correlation based on a Mantel test. (D) Correlations between moisture and salt concentrations in bloomy, natural, and washed rind cheeses. If the microbes that colonize rind communities are dispersal limited, diversity could be shaped in part by stochastic processes; cheeses made and aged in the same geographic regions would have more similar community composition than those aged further apart. However, across our entire data set for Europe and the United States, community composition is not significantly correlated with geographic distance (Mantel r = 0.04, p = 0.07; Figure S3C). In fact, cheeses made in geographically distant parts of the world can have strikingly similar rind communities (Figure S3B), demonstrating that these microbial communities can assemble reproducibly regardless of the cheesemaking region. In contrast to a limited role for geography, environmental conditions do correlate with variation in community composition. During the process of aging cheeses, surface moisture, pH, and salinity are carefully controlled (Beresford et al., 2001Beresford T.P. Fitzsimons N.A. Brennan N.L. Cogan T.M. Recent advances in cheese microbiology.Int. Dairy J. 2001; 11: 259-274Crossref Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and some of these variables are significantly different across the three rind types (Figure 3B). We find that moisture is the best predictor of rind community composition, with principal coordinate one (PC1) being significantly associated with the gradient in surface moisture measured across natural, washed, and bloomy rind cheeses (r2 = 0.35, p < 0.0001; Figure 3C). This association between moisture and composition is also supported by Mantel tests, in which rind biofilm moisture (Mantel r = 0.21, p < 0.001)—and to some extent pH (Mantel r = 0.06, p = 0.02), but not salinity (Mantel r = −0.02, p = 0.57)—are correlated with community composition. Dominant genera show contrasting responses to this gradient in surface moisture. The fungus Galactomyces and four genera of Proteobacteria, both found in high abundance on moist bloomy rinds (Figure S2C), are positively correlated with moisture (Figure 3D), whereas several other fungal and bacterial taxa (Scopulariopsis, Aspergillus, Actinobacteria, and Staphylococcus), which are abundant on dry natural rinds (Figure S2C), are negatively associated with moisture (Figure 3D). Abiotic conditions have a strong influence on rind community diversity, but interactions among microbes could also play a role. We used our independent bacterial and fungal amplicon data sets to quantify co-occurrence patterns across individual bacterial and fungal genera and found evidence for both strong positive and negative associations (Figure 3E). These could be explained by positive or negative interactions among species and/or shared environmental niches. Total community composition, as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, is correlated between our bacterial and fungal data sets (Mantel r = 0.20, p < 0.001). A measure of community richness, the total number of bacterial and fungal community operational taxonomic units (OTUs, or clusters of closely related sequences) is also correlated (r2 = 0.13, p < 0.001; Figure 3F), suggesting that species interactions or environmental factors select for communities with similar compositions. In addition to understanding how taxonomic diversity varies with rind type, we investigated functional potential among cheese rind communities. Shotgun metagenomic data revealed an uneven distribution of reads mapping to fungi versus bacteria across the three rind types, with lower abundance of fungi in washed rind cheeses (Figure S4A). As with taxonomic diversity, functional potential clusters by rind type and is correlated with moisture (Figure 4A). Unlike taxonomic diversity, functional potential is also correlated with pH. We identified metabolic pathways that were enriched in washed, natural, or bloomy rind cheeses (Figure 4B and Table S4A). We found several pathways associated with flavor production significantly enriched in washed rind cheeses. This group of cheeses is notorious for having particularly pungent aromas (Fox et al., 2004Fox P.F. McSweeney P.L.H. Cogan T.M. Guinee T.P. Cheese: Chemistry, Physics and Microbiology. Volume 1. Academic Press, London2004Google Scholar). Cysteine and methionine metabolism, known to contribute to the production of volatile sulfur compounds such as methanethiol, are enriched in these communities. Pathways for valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, which can contribute to sweaty and putrid aromas, are also enriched in washed rind cheeses (Table S4A).Figure 4Functional Diversity of Cheese Rind Microbial CommunitiesShow full caption(A) Procrustes analysis shows similar clustering of samples (M2 = 0.391) using either taxonomic (amplicon) or functional (whole-genome shotgun sequencing, WGS) data from 22 rind metagenomes.

https://openalex.org/W2003470745,"Transcription of highly expressed genes has been shown to occur in stochastic bursts. But the origin of such ubiquitous phenomenon has not been understood. Here, we present the mechanism in bacteria. We developed a high-throughput, in vitro, single-molecule assay to follow transcription on individual DNA templates in real time. We showed that positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment by transcription slows down transcription elongation and eventually stops transcription initiation. Transcription can be resumed upon gyrase binding to the DNA segment. Furthermore, using single-cell mRNA counting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that duty cycles of transcriptional bursting depend on the intracellular gyrase concentration. Together, these findings prove that transcriptional bursting of highly expressed genes in bacteria is primarily caused by reversible gyrase dissociation from and rebinding to a DNA segment, changing the supercoiling level of the segment."
https://openalex.org/W2080598921,"The etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been linked to deficiencies in mismatch repair and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) proteins, diet, inflammatory processes, and gut microbiota. However, the mechanism through which the microbiota synergizes with these etiologic factors to promote CRC is not clear. We report that altering the microbiota composition reduces CRC in APC(Min/+)MSH2(-/-) mice, and that a diet reduced in carbohydrates phenocopies this effect. Gut microbes did not induce CRC in these mice through an inflammatory response or the production of DNA mutagens but rather by providing carbohydrate-derived metabolites such as butyrate that fuel hyperproliferation of MSH2(-/-) colon epithelial cells. Further, we provide evidence that the mismatch repair pathway has a role in regulating β-catenin activity and modulating the differentiation of transit-amplifying cells in the colon. These data thereby provide an explanation for the interaction between microbiota, diet, and mismatch repair deficiency in CRC induction. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2078021348,"Chaperones are abundant cellular proteins that promote the folding and function of their substrate proteins (clients). In vivo, chaperones also associate with a large and diverse set of cofactors (cochaperones) that regulate their specificity and function. However, how these cochaperones regulate protein folding and whether they have chaperone-independent biological functions is largely unknown. We combined mass spectrometry and quantitative high-throughput LUMIER assays to systematically characterize the chaperone-cochaperone-client interaction network in human cells. We uncover hundreds of chaperone clients, delineate their participation in specific cochaperone complexes, and establish a surprisingly distinct network of protein-protein interactions for cochaperones. As a salient example of the power of such analysis, we establish that NUDC family cochaperones specifically associate with structurally related but evolutionarily distinct β-propeller folds. We provide a framework for deciphering the proteostasis network and its regulation in development and disease and expand the use of chaperones as sensors for drug-target engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2066029285,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a microtubule plus-end scaffolding protein important in biology and disease. APC is implicated in RNA localization, although the mechanisms and functional significance remain unclear. We show APC is an RNA-binding protein and identify an RNA interactome by HITS-CLIP. Targets were highly enriched for APC-related functions, including microtubule organization, cell motility, cancer, and neurologic disease. Among the targets is β2B-tubulin, known to be required in human neuron and axon migration. We show β2B-tubulin is synthesized in axons and localizes preferentially to dynamic microtubules in the growth cone periphery. APC binds the β2B-tubulin 3′ UTR; experiments interfering with this interaction reduced β2B-tubulin mRNA axonal localization and expression, depleted dynamic microtubules and the growth cone periphery, and impaired neuron migration. These results identify APC as a platform binding functionally related protein and RNA networks, and suggest a self-organizing model for the microtubule to localize synthesis of its own subunits."

Here, we identify polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as a centromere-localized regulator required to initiate CENP-A deposition in human cells. We demonstrate that faithful CENP-A deposition requires integrated signals from Plk1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), with Plk1 promoting the localization of the key CENP-A deposition factor, the Mis18 complex, and CDK inhibiting Mis18 complex assembly. By bypassing these regulated steps, we uncoupled CENP-A deposition from cell-cycle progression, resulting in mitotic defects. Thus, CENP-A deposition is controlled by a two-step regulatory paradigm comprised of Plk1 and CDK that is crucial for genomic integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1979316890,"In this study, we examined whether a homolog of the master sex-determining gene amhy of Odontesthes hatcheri is present and plays any role in testis determination of pejerrey O. bonariensis, a species otherwise known for its strong temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Screening of wild and laboratory-reared pejerrey for amhy revealed a high, although not complete linkage with phenotypic sex. The sex ratio in an amhy+/-/amhy-/- full sibling progeny reared during the thermolabile period of sex determination at an intermediate temperature of 25°C was 68.7% male:31.3% female; all amhy+/- fish developed as males whereas about 2/3 and 1/3 of the amhy-/- were female and male, respectively. Expression analyses revealed that amhy transcription began during embryo stage and decreased by the end of sex determination period. The autosomal amha was present in all individuals regardless of amhy genotype; its expression increased significantly from the end of the same period in the gonads of all amhy+/- but only in part of the amhy-/- animals. After histological gonadal differentiation, all gonads of amhy-/- animals with amha ISH signals were testes and those without it were ovaries. These results suggest that amhy is important for testicular differentiation in pejerrey, at least at intermediate temperatures. Thus, we hypothesize that amhy+/- animals differentiate as males by expression of either amhy alone or amhy and amha together whereas the amhy-/- probably rely solely on amha expression. These findings represent the first clear genomic evidence that genotypic and environmental sex determinants can coexist in species with marked TSD such as the pejerrey. The finding of amhy will make possible to monitor wild pejerrey populations for mismatches between genotypic and phenotypic sex and may prove instrumental for field studies addressing the effects of endocrine disruptors or abnormal temperatures on reproduction and the ecological relevance of TSD for this species."
https://openalex.org/W2017258578,"It is well documented that slag-based silicon fertilizers have beneficial effects on the growth and disease resistance of rice. However, their effects vary greatly with sources of slag and are closely related to availability of silicon (Si) in these materials. To date, few researches have been done to compare the differences in plant performance and disease resistance between different slag-based silicon fertilizers applied at the same rate of plant-available Si. In the present study both steel and iron slags were chosen to investigate their effects on rice growth and disease resistance under greenhouse conditions. Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to examine the effects of slags on ultrastructural changes in leaves of rice naturally infected by Bipolaris oryaze, the causal agent of brown spot. The results showed that both slag-based Si fertilizers tested significantly increased rice growth and yield, but decreased brown spot incidence, with steel slag showing a stronger effect than iron slag. The results of SEM analysis showed that application of slags led to more pronounced cell silicification in rice leaves, more silica cells, and more pronounced and larger papilla as well. The results of TEM analysis showed that mesophyll cells of slag-untreated rice leaf were disorganized, with colonization of the fungus (Bipolaris oryzae), including chloroplast degradation and cell wall alterations. The application of slag maintained mesophyll cells relatively intact and increased the thickness of silicon layer. It can be concluded that applying slag-based fertilizer to Si-deficient paddy soil is necessary for improving both rice productivity and brown spot resistance. The immobile silicon deposited in host cell walls and papillae sites is the first physical barrier for fungal penetration, while the soluble Si in the cytoplasm enhances physiological or induced resistance to fungal colonization."
https://openalex.org/W1963652938,"Studies show evidence of longitudinal brain volume decreases in schizophrenia. We studied brain volume changes and their relation to symptom severity, level of function, cognition, and antipsychotic medication in participants with schizophrenia and control participants from a general population based birth cohort sample in a relatively long follow-up period of almost a decade. All members of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with any psychotic disorder and a random sample not having psychosis were invited for a MRI brain scan, and clinical and cognitive assessment during 1999–2001 at the age of 33–35 years. A follow-up was conducted 9 years later during 2008–2010. Brain scans at both time points were obtained from 33 participants with schizophrenia and 71 control participants. Regression models were used to examine whether brain volume changes predicted clinical and cognitive changes over time, and whether antipsychotic medication predicted brain volume changes. The mean annual whole brain volume reduction was 0.69% in schizophrenia, and 0.49% in controls (p = 0.003, adjusted for gender, educational level, alcohol use and weight gain). The brain volume reduction in schizophrenia patients was found especially in the temporal lobe and periventricular area. Symptom severity, functioning level, and decline in cognition were not associated with brain volume reduction in schizophrenia. The amount of antipsychotic medication (dose years of equivalent to 100 mg daily chlorpromazine) over the follow-up period predicted brain volume loss (p = 0.003 adjusted for symptom level, alcohol use and weight gain). In this population based sample, brain volume reduction continues in schizophrenia patients after the onset of illness, and antipsychotic medications may contribute to these reductions."
https://openalex.org/W1977557893,"Reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) holds enormous promise for regenerative medicine. To elucidate endogenous barriers limiting this process, we systematically dissected human cellular reprogramming by combining a genome-wide RNAi screen, innovative computational methods, extensive single-hit validation, and mechanistic investigation of relevant pathways and networks. We identify reprogramming barriers, including genes involved in transcription, chromatin regulation, ubiquitination, dephosphorylation, vesicular transport, and cell adhesion. Specific a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) proteins inhibit reprogramming, and the disintegrin domain of ADAM29 is necessary and sufficient for this function. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis can be targeted with small molecules and opposes reprogramming by positively regulating TGF-β signaling. Genetic interaction studies of endocytosis or ubiquitination reveal that barrier pathways can act in linear, parallel, or feedforward loop architectures to antagonize reprogramming. These results provide a global view of barriers to human cellular reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2060515712,"The wealth of interaction information provided in biomedical articles motivated the implementation of text mining approaches to automatically extract biomedical relations. This paper presents an unsupervised method based on pattern clustering and sentence parsing to deal with biomedical relation extraction. Pattern clustering algorithm is based on Polynomial Kernel method, which identifies interaction words from unlabeled data; these interaction words are then used in relation extraction between entity pairs. Dependency parsing and phrase structure parsing are combined for relation extraction. Based on the semi-supervised KNN algorithm, we extend the proposed unsupervised approach to a semi-supervised approach by combining pattern clustering, dependency parsing and phrase structure parsing rules. We evaluated the approaches on two different tasks: (1) Protein–protein interactions extraction, and (2) Gene–suicide association extraction. The evaluation of task (1) on the benchmark dataset (AImed corpus) showed that our proposed unsupervised approach outperformed three supervised methods. The three supervised methods are rule based, SVM based, and Kernel based separately. The proposed semi-supervised approach is superior to the existing semi-supervised methods. The evaluation on gene–suicide association extraction on a smaller dataset from Genetic Association Database and a larger dataset from publicly available PubMed showed that the proposed unsupervised and semi-supervised methods achieved much higher F-scores than co-occurrence based method."
https://openalex.org/W2018933131,"Flowering time and plant height are important agronomic traits for crop production. In this study, we characterized a semi-dwarf and late flowering (dlf1) mutation of rice that has pleiotropic effects on these traits. The dlf1 mutation was caused by a T-DNA insertion and the cloned Dlf1 gene was found to encode a WRKY transcription factor (OsWRKY11). The dlf1 mutant contains a T-DNA insertion at the promoter region, leading to enhanced accumulation of Dlf1 transcripts, resulting in a semidominant mutation. The dlf1 mutation suppressed the transcription of Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 and its downstream flowering-time genes including Hd1, Ehd1 and Hd3a under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Knock-down of Dlf1 expression exhibited early flowering at LD condition related to the wild-type plants. Accumulation of Dlf1 mRNA was observed in most tissues, and two splicing forms of Dlf1 cDNAs were obtained (OsWRKY11.1 and OsWRKY11.2). These two proteins showed transactivation activity in yeast cells. Dlf1 protein was found to be localized in the nucleus. Enhanced expression of OsWRKY11.2 or its 5' truncated gene showed similar phenotypes to the dlf1 mutant, suggesting that it might function as a negative regulator. We conclude that Dlf1 acts as a transactivator to downregulate Ehd2/RID1/OsId1 in the signal transduction pathway of flowering and plays an important role in the regulation of plant height in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2068087698,"Previously we revealed that the extra domain of SARS 3CLpro mediated the catalysis via different mechanisms. While the R298A mutation completely abolished the dimerization, thus resulting in the inactive catalytic machinery, N214A inactivated the enzyme by altering its dynamics without significantly perturbing its structure. Here we studied another mutant with S284-T285-I286 replaced by Ala (STI/A) with a 3.6-fold activity increase and slightly enhanced dimerization. We determined its crystal structure, which still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wild-type (WT), except for slightly tighter packing between two extra-domains. We then conducted 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both STI/A and WT, the longest reported so far for 3CLpro. In the simulations, two STI/A extra domains become further tightly packed, leading to a significant volume reduction of the nano-channel formed by residues from both catalytic and extra domains. The enhanced packing appears to slightly increase the dynamic stability of the N-finger and the first helix residues, which subsequently triggers the redistribution of dynamics over residues directly contacting them. This ultimately enhances the dynamical stability of the residues constituting the catalytic dyad and substrate-binding pockets. Further correlation analysis reveals that a global network of the correlated motions exists in the protease, whose components include all residues identified so far to be critical for the dimerization and catalysis. Most strikingly, the N214A mutation globally decouples this network while the STI/A mutation alters the correlation pattern. Together with previous results, the present study establishes that besides the classic structural allostery, the dynamic allostery also operates in the SARS 3CLpro, which is surprisingly able to relay the perturbations on the extra domain onto the catalytic machinery to manifest opposite catalytic effects. Our results thus imply a promising avenue to design specific inhibitors for 3CL proteases by disrupting their dynamic correlation network."
https://openalex.org/W2049365404,"The degeneration of hair cells in the mammalian cochlea results in permanent sensorineural hearing loss. This study aimed to promote the regeneration of sensory hair cells in the mature cochlea and their reconnection with auditory neurons through the introduction of ATOH1, a transcription factor known to be necessary for hair cell development, and the introduction of neurotrophic factors. Adenoviral vectors containing ATOH1 alone, or with neurotrophin-3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor were injected into the lower basal scala media of guinea pig cochleae four days post ototoxic deafening. Guinea pigs treated with ATOH1 gene therapy, alone, had a significantly greater number of cells expressing hair cell markers compared to the contralateral non-treated cochlea when examined 3 weeks post-treatment. This increase, however, did not result in a commensurate improvement in hearing thresholds, nor was there an increase in synaptic ribbons, as measured by CtBP2 puncta after ATOH1 treatment alone, or when combined with neurotrophins. However, hair cell formation and synaptogenesis after co-treatment with ATOH1 and neurotrophic factors remain inconclusive as viral transduction was reduced due to the halving of viral titres when the samples were combined. Collectively, these data suggest that, whilst ATOH1 alone can drive non-sensory cells towards an immature sensory hair cell phenotype in the mature cochlea, this does not result in functional improvements after aminoglycoside-induced deafness."
https://openalex.org/W1980627188,"Hermes is a member of the hAT transposon superfamily that has active representatives, including McClintock's archetypal Ac mobile genetic element, in many eukaryotic species. The crystal structure of the Hermes transposase-DNA complex reveals that Hermes forms an octameric ring organized as a tetramer of dimers. Although isolated dimers are active in vitro for all the chemical steps of transposition, only octamers are active in vivo. The octamer can provide not only multiple specific DNA-binding domains to recognize repeated subterminal sequences within the transposon ends, which are important for activity, but also multiple nonspecific DNA binding surfaces for target capture. The unusual assembly explains the basis of bipartite DNA recognition at hAT transposon ends, provides a rationale for transposon end asymmetry, and suggests how the avidity provided by multiple sites of interaction could allow a transposase to locate its transposon ends amidst a sea of chromosomal DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2062957362,"Background The aims were to investigate the hepatitis C (HCV) cascade of care among HIV-infected patients and to identify reasons for not referring for and not initiating HCV therapy after completion of HCV treatment staging. Design and Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of HIV-infected patients under care at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). We identified patients screened for and diagnosed with active HCV infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with lack of referral for HCV therapy. Electronic medical records were reviewed to ascertain reasons for not initiating HCV therapy. Results Between 2008 and 2012, 4725 HIV-infected patients received care at the UCSD Owen clinic. Most patients [4534 (96%)] were screened for HCV, 748 (16%) patients had reactive serum HCV antibodies but only 542 patients had active HCV infection. Lack of engagement in care was the most important predictor of non-referral for HCV therapy [odds ratio (OR): 5.08, 95% confidence interval 3.24–6.97, p<0.00001]. Other significant predictors included unstable housing (OR: 2.26), AIDS (OR: 1.83), having a detectable HIV viral load (OR: 1.98) and being non-white (OR: 1.67). The most common reason (40%) for not initiating or deferring HCV therapy was the presence of ongoing barriers to care. Conclusions Screening for HCV in HIV-infected patients linked to care is high but almost half of patients diagnosed with HCV are not referred for HCV therapy. Despite improvements in HCV therapy the benefits will not be realized unless effective measures for dealing with barriers to care are implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2047594915,"Chitin, an integral component of the fungal cell wall, is one of the best-studied microbe-associated molecular patterns. Previous work identified a LysM receptor-like kinase (LysM-RLK1/CERK1) as the primary chitin receptor in Arabidopsis. In order to identify proteins that interact with CERK1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular kinase domain of CERK1 as the bait. This screen identified 54 putative CERK1-interactors. Screening mutants defective in 43 of these interacting proteins identified only two, a calmodulin like protein (At3g10190) and a leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (At3g14840), which differed in their response to pathogen challenge. In the present work, we focused on characterizing the LRR-RLK gene where mutations altered responses to chitin elicitation. This LRR-RLK was named LysM RLK1-interacting kinase 1 (LIK1). The interaction between CERK1 and LIK1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using protoplasts and transgenic plants. In vitro experiments showed that LIK1 was directly phosphorylated by CERK1. In vivo phosphorylation assays showed that Col-0 wild-type plants have more phosphorylated LIK1 than cerk1 mutant plants, suggesting that LIK1 may be directly phosphorylated by CERK1. Lik1 mutant plants showed an enhanced response to both chitin and flagellin elicitors. In comparison to the wild-type plants, lik1 mutant plants were more resistant to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, but more susceptible to the necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Consistent with the enhanced susceptibility to necrotrophs, lik1 mutants showed reduced expression of genes involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways. These data suggest that LIK1 directly interacts with CERK1 and regulates MAMP-triggered innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2036868154,"The development of neuropathic syndromes is an important, dose limiting side effect of anticancer agents like platinum derivates, taxanes and vinca alkaloids. The causes of neurotoxicity are still unclear but the impairment of the oxidative equilibrium is strictly related to pain. Two intracellular organelles, mitochondria and peroxisomes cooperate to the maintaining of the redox cellular state. Whereas a relationship between chemotherapy-dependent mitochondrial alteration and neuropathy has been established, the role of peroxisome is poor explored. In order to study the mechanisms of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, peroxisomal involvement was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In primary rat astrocyte cell culture, oxaliplatin (10 µM for 48 h or 1 µM for 5 days) increased the number of peroxisomes, nevertheless expression and functionality of catalase, the most important antioxidant defense enzyme in mammalian peroxisomes, were significantly reduced. Five day incubation with the selective Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) antagonist G3335 (30 µM) induced a similar peroxisomal impairment suggesting a relationship between PPARγ signaling and oxaliplatin neurotoxicity. The PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (10 µM) reduced the harmful effects induced both by G3335 and oxaliplatin. In vivo, in a rat model of oxaliplatin induced neuropathy, a repeated treatment with rosiglitazone (3 and 10 mg kg−1 per os) significantly reduced neuropathic pain evoked by noxious (Paw pressure test) and non-noxious (Cold plate test) stimuli. The behavioral effect paralleled with the prevention of catalase impairment induced by oxaliplatin in dorsal root ganglia. In the spinal cord, catalase protection was showed by the lower rosiglitazone dosage without effect on the astrocyte density increase induced by oxaliplatin. Rosiglitazone did not alter the oxaliplatin-induced mortality of the human colon cancer cell line HT-29. These results highlight the role of peroxisomes in oxaliplatin-dependent nervous damage and suggest PPARγ stimulation as a candidate to counteract oxaliplatin neurotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2092062541,"One of the greatest challenges in biomedical research, drug discovery and diagnostics is understanding how seemingly identical cells can respond differently to perturbagens including drugs for disease treatment. Although heterogeneity has become an accepted characteristic of a population of cells, in drug discovery it is not routinely evaluated or reported. The standard practice for cell-based, high content assays has been to assume a normal distribution and to report a well-to-well average value with a standard deviation. To address this important issue we sought to define a method that could be readily implemented to identify, quantify and characterize heterogeneity in cellular and small organism assays to guide decisions during drug discovery and experimental cell/tissue profiling. Our study revealed that heterogeneity can be effectively identified and quantified with three indices that indicate diversity, non-normality and percent outliers. The indices were evaluated using the induction and inhibition of STAT3 activation in five cell lines where the systems response including sample preparation and instrument performance were well characterized and controlled. These heterogeneity indices provide a standardized method that can easily be integrated into small and large scale screening or profiling projects to guide interpretation of the biology, as well as the development of therapeutics and diagnostics. Understanding the heterogeneity in the response to perturbagens will become a critical factor in designing strategies for the development of therapeutics including targeted polypharmacology."
https://openalex.org/W1993431711,"Drought, heat and other abiotic stresses during grain filling can result in reductions in grain weight. Conserved water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) at early grain filling play an important role in partial compensation of reduced carbon supply. A diverse population of 262 historical winter wheat accessions was used in the present study. There were significant correlations between 1000-grain weight (TGW) and four types of WSC, viz. (1) total WSC at the mid-grain filling stage (14 days after flowering) produced by leaves and non-leaf organs; (2) WSC contributed by current leaf assimilation during the mid-grain filling; (3) WSC in non-leaf organs at the mid-grain filling, excluding the current leaf assimilation; and (4) WSC used for respiration and remobilization during the mid-grain filling. Association and favorable allele analyses of 209 genome-wide SSR markers and the four types of WSC were conducted using a mixed linear model. Seven novel favorable WSC alleles exhibited positive individual contributions to TGW, which were verified under 16 environments. Dosage effects of pyramided favorable WSC alleles and significantly linear correlations between the number of favorable WSC alleles and TGW were observed. Our results suggested that pyramiding more favorable WSC alleles was effective for improving both WSC and grain weight in future wheat breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W1971231415,"Depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Excessive sympathetic activation and serious myocardial remodeling may contribute to this association. The aim of this study was to discuss the effect of depression on sympathetic activity and myocardial remodeling after MI. Wild-type (WT) rats were divided into a sham group (Sham), a myocardial infarction group (MI), a depression group (D), and a myocardial infarction plus depression group (MI+D). Compared with controls, the MI+D animals displayed depression-like behaviors and attenuated body weight gain. The evaluation of sympathetic activity showed an increased level in plasma concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine and higher expression of myocardial tyrosine hydroxylase in the MI+D group than the control groups (p<0.05 for all). Cardiac function and morphologic analyses revealed a decreased fractional shortening accompanied by increased left ventricular dimensions, thinning myocardium wall, and reduced collagen repair in the MI+D group compared with the MI group (p<0.05 for all). Frequent premature ventricular contractions, prolonged QT duration and ventricular repolarization duration, shorted effective refractory period, and increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia were displayed in MI+D rats. These results indicate that sympathetic hyperactivation and exacerbated myocardial remodeling may be a plausible mechanism linking depression to an adverse prognosis after MI."
https://openalex.org/W2052811279,"Genes of the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are of great interest to biologists because of their important role in immunity and disease, and their extremely high levels of genetic diversity. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are quickly becoming the method of choice for high-throughput genotyping of multi-locus templates like MHC in non-model organisms. Previous approaches to genotyping MHC genes using NGS technologies suffer from two problems:1) a ""gray zone"" where low frequency alleles and high frequency artifacts can be difficult to disentangle and 2) a similar sequence problem, where very similar alleles can be difficult to distinguish as two distinct alleles. Here were present a new method for genotyping MHC loci--Stepwise Threshold Clustering (STC)--that addresses these problems by taking full advantage of the increase in sequence data provided by NGS technologies. Unlike previous approaches for genotyping MHC with NGS data that attempt to classify individual sequences as alleles or artifacts, STC uses a quasi-Dirichlet clustering algorithm to cluster similar sequences at increasing levels of sequence similarity. By applying frequency and similarity based criteria to clusters rather than individual sequences, STC is able to successfully identify clusters of sequences that correspond to individual or similar alleles present in the genomes of individual samples. Furthermore, STC does not require duplicate runs of all samples, increasing the number of samples that can be genotyped in a given project. We show how the STC method works using a single sample library. We then apply STC to 295 threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) samples from four populations and show that neighboring populations differ significantly in MHC allele pools. We show that STC is a reliable, accurate, efficient, and flexible method for genotyping MHC that will be of use to biologists interested in a variety of downstream applications."
https://openalex.org/W2112472890,"We previously reported a positive association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and colorectal cancer risk. To further elucidate this association, we examined the molar ratio of 25(OH)D to vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the primary 25(OH)D transport protein, and whether DBP modified the association between 25(OH)D and colorectal cancer risk.In a nested case-control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study, controls were 1∶1 matched to 416 colorectal cancer cases based on age and date of blood collection. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for quartiles of 25(OH)D, DBP, and the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for free, unbound circulating 25(OH)D.Comparing highest to lowest quartiles, DBP was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.42, p for trend = 0.58); however, a positive risk association was observed for the molar ratio of 25(OH)D:DBP (OR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.92, 2.26, p for trend = 0.04). In stratified analyses, the positive association between 25(OH)D and colorectal cancer was stronger among men with DBP levels above the median (OR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.36, p for trend = 0.01) than below the median (OR = 1.20; 95% CI: 0.68, 2.12, p for trend = 0.87), although the interaction was not statistically significant (p for interaction = 0.24).Circulating DBP may influence the association between 25(OH)D and colorectal cancer in male smokers, with the suggestion of a stronger positive association in men with higher DBP concentrations. This finding should be examined in other populations, especially those that include women and non-smokers."
https://openalex.org/W2020406739,"The net consequence of nectar robbing on reproductive success of plants is usually negative and the positive effect is rarely produced. We evaluated the influence of nectar robbing on the behaviour of pollinators and the reproductive success of Tecomella undulata (Bignoniaceae) in a natural population. Experimental pollinations showed that the trees were strictly self-incompatible. The three types of floral colour morphs of the tree viz. red, orange and yellow, lacked compatibility barriers. The pollinators (Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus leucotis) and the robber (Nectarinia asiatica) showed equal preference for all the morphs, as they visited each morph with nearly equal frequency and flower-handling time. The sunbirds caused up to 60% nectar robbing, mostly (99%) by piercing through the corolla tube. Although nectar is replenished at regular intervals, insufficient amount of nectar compelled the pollinators to visit additional trees in bloom. Data of manual nectar robbing from the entire tree showed that the pollinators covered lower number of flowers per tree (5 flowers/tree) and more trees per bout (7 trees/bout) than the unrobbed ones (19 flowers/tree and 2 trees bout). The robbed trees set a significantly greater amount of fruits than the unrobbed trees. However, the number of seeds in a fruit did not differ significantly. The study shows that plant-pollinator-robber interaction may benefit the self-incompatible plant species under conditions that increases the visits of pollinators among the compatible conspecifics in a population."
https://openalex.org/W2062600620,"Pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity due to mutations in the GAA gene. Pompe disease is characterized by accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in heart and skeletal muscles, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. We have shown previously that the small molecule pharmacological chaperone AT2220 (1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride, duvoglustat hydrochloride) binds and stabilizes wild-type as well as multiple mutant forms of GAA, and can lead to higher cellular levels of GAA. In this study, we examined the effect of AT2220 on mutant GAA, in vitro and in vivo, with a primary focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained P545L mutant form of human GAA (P545L GAA). AT2220 increased the specific activity of P545L GAA toward both natural (glycogen) and artificial substrates in vitro. Incubation with AT2220 also increased the ER export, lysosomal delivery, proteolytic processing, and stability of P545L GAA. In a new transgenic mouse model of Pompe disease that expresses human P545L on a Gaa knockout background (Tg/KO) and is characterized by reduced GAA activity and elevated glycogen levels in disease-relevant tissues, daily oral administration of AT2220 for 4 weeks resulted in significant and dose-dependent increases in mature lysosomal GAA isoforms and GAA activity in heart and skeletal muscles. Importantly, oral administration of AT2220 also resulted in significant glycogen reduction in disease-relevant tissues. Compared to daily administration, less-frequent AT2220 administration, including repeated cycles of 4 or 5 days with AT2220 followed by 3 or 2 days without drug, respectively, resulted in even greater glycogen reductions. Collectively, these data indicate that AT2220 increases the specific activity, trafficking, and lysosomal stability of P545L GAA, leads to increased levels of mature GAA in lysosomes, and promotes glycogen reduction in situ. As such, AT2220 may warrant further evaluation as a treatment for Pompe disease."

Here, we demonstrate its beneficial effect in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice, a model for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in man, and we document the underlying mechanisms. Peroral administration of glycyrol significantly reduced clinical scores, alleviated cartilage and bone erosion and reduced levels of serum inflammatory cytokines. Glycyrol also decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity, improved carbon clearance and reduced acetic acid-induced capillary permeability. Furthermore, glycyrol decreased NF-κB and NFAT transcriptional activities and inhibited IL-2 expression. The therapeutic effect of glycyrol was associated with down-regulation of both autoimmune and inflammatory reactions. In addition, we demonstrated that glycyrol has minimal acute toxicity in mice. Therefore, we propose that glycyrol may hold promise for future treatment of RA."
https://openalex.org/W1980333243,"Online consumer behavior in general and online customer engagement with brands in particular, has become a major focus of research activity fuelled by the exponential increase of interactive functions of the internet and social media platforms and applications.

In this paper, we aim to propose a novel methodology for reverse engineering a consumer behavior model for online customer engagement, based on a computational and data-driven perspective. This methodology could be generalized and prove useful for future research in the fields of consumer behaviors using questionnaire data or studies investigating other types of human behaviors. The method we propose contains five main stages; symbolic regression analysis, graph building, community detection, evaluation of results and finally, investigation of directed cycles and common feedback loops. The ‘communities’ of questionnaire items that emerge from our community detection method form possible ‘functional constructs’ inferred from data rather than assumed from literature and theory. Our results show consistent partitioning of questionnaire items into such ‘functional constructs’ suggesting the method proposed here could be adopted as a new data-driven way of human behavior modeling."
https://openalex.org/W2018535457,"Sandy beaches support a wide variety of underappreciated biodiversity that is critical to coastal ecosystems. Prior to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the diversity and function of supratidal beach sediment microbial communities along Gulf of Mexico coastlines were not well understood. As such, it was unclear if microbial community compositional changes would occur following exposure to beached oil, if indigenous communities could biodegrade oil, or how cleanup efforts, such as sand washing and sediment redistribution, would impact microbial ecosystem resiliency. Transects perpendicular to the shoreline were sampled from public beaches on Grand Isle, Louisiana, and Dauphin Island, Alabama, over one year. Prior to oil coming onshore, elevated levels of bacteria associated with fecal contamination were detected (e.g., Enterobacteriales and Campylobacterales). Over time, significant shifts within major phyla were identified (e.g., Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria) and fecal indicator groups were replaced by taxa affiliated with open-ocean and marine systems (e.g., Oceanospirillales, Rhodospirillales, and Rhodobacterales). These new bacterial groups included putative hydrocarbon degraders, similar to those identified near the oil plume offshore. Shifts in the microbial community composition strongly correlated to more poorly sorted sediment and grain size distributional changes. Natural oceanographic processes could not account for the disrupted sediment, especially from the backshore well above the maximum high-tide levels recorded at these sites. Sand washing and tilling occurred on both open beaches from August through at least December 2010, which were mechanisms that could replace fecal indicator groups with open-ocean groups. Consequently, remediation efforts meant to return beaches to pre-spill compositions caused a regime shift that may have added potential ecosystem function, like hydrocarbon degradation, to the sediment. Future research will need to assess the persistence and impact of the newly formed microbial communities to the overall sandy beach ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1976027002,"Objectives To examine the implementation of the Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) among surgeons and anaesthetists working in Swiss hospitals and clinics and their perceptions of the SSC. Methods Cross-sectional survey at the 97th Annual Meeting of the Swiss Society of Surgery, Switzerland, 2010. Opinions of the SSC were assessed with a 6-item questionnaire. Results 152 respondents answered the questionnaire (participation rate 35.1%). 64.7% respondents acknowledged having a checklist in their hospital or their clinic. Median implementation year was 2009. More than 8 out of 10 respondents reported their team applied the Sign In and the Time Out very often or quasi systematically, whereas almost half of respondents acknowledged the Sign Out was applied never or rarely. The majority of respondents agreed that the checklist improves safety and team communication, and helps to develop a safety culture. However, they were less supportive about the opinion that the checklist facilitates teamwork and eliminates social hierarchy between caregivers. Conclusions This survey indicates that the SSC has been largely implemented in many Swiss hospitals and clinics. Both surgeons and anaesthetists perceived the SSC as a valuable tool in improving intraoperative patient safety and communication among health care professionals, with lesser importance in facilitating teamwork (and eliminating hierarchical categories)."
https://openalex.org/W2089207626,"Objective The influence of hematological indices such as complete blood count on microcirculation is poorly understood. Retinal microvasculature can be directly visualized and vessel calibers are associated with a range of ocular and systemic diseases. We examined the association of complete blood count with retinal vessel calibers. Methods Cross-sectional population-based Blue Mountains Eye Study, n = 3009, aged 49+ years. Complete blood count was measured from fasting blood samples taken at baseline examination, 1992–4. Retinal arteriolar and venular calibers were measured from digitized retinal photographs using a validated semi-automated computer program. Results All analyses adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and fellow vessel caliber. Higher hematocrit, white cell count and platelet count were associated with narrower arteriolar caliber (p = 0.02, 0.03 and 0.001 respectively), while higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell count, white cell count and platelet count were associated with wider venular caliber (p<0.0001 for all). Each quintile increase in hematocrit, white cell count and platelet count was associated with approximately 0.5 µm narrower arteriolar caliber; whereas each quintile increase in all of the complete blood count components was associated with approximately 1–2 µm wider venular caliber. Conclusions These associations show that elevated levels of hematological indices can have adverse effects on the microcirculation."
https://openalex.org/W2024883910,"The optimal balance of reproductive effort between offspring size and number depends on the fitness of offspring size in a particular environment. The variable environments offspring experience, both among and within life-history stages, are likely to alter the offspring size/fitness relationship and favor different offspring sizes. Hence, the many environments experienced throughout complex life-histories present mothers with a significant challenge to optimally allocate their reproductive effort. In a marine annelid, we tested the relationship between egg size and performance across multiple life-history stages, including: fertilization, larval development, and post-metamorphosis survival and size in the field. We found evidence of conflicting effects of egg size on performance: larger eggs had higher fertilization under sperm-limited conditions, were slightly faster to develop pre-feeding, and were larger post-metamorphosis; however, smaller eggs had higher fertilization when sperm was abundant, and faster planktonic development; and egg size did not affect post-metamorphic survival. The results indicate that egg size effects are conflicting in H. diramphus depending on the environments within and among life-history stages. We suggest that offspring size in this species may be a compromise between the overall costs and benefits of egg sizes in each stage and that performance in any one stage is not maximized."
https://openalex.org/W2053054417,"Sleep disturbances are common in patients with chronic lung diseases, but little is known about the prevalence in patients with bronchiectasis. A cross sectional study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and determinants associated with sleep disturbances, and the correlation between sleep disturbances and quality of life (QoL) in adults with steady-state bronchiectasis.One hundred and forty-four bronchiectasis patients and eighty healthy subjects were enrolled. Sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, and QoL were measured by utilizing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), respectively. Demographic, clinical indices, radiology, spirometry, bacteriology, anxiety and depression were also assessed.Adults with steady-state bronchiectasis had a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances (PSQI>5) (57% vs. 29%, P<0.001), but not daytime sleepiness (ESS≥10) (32% vs. 30%, P = 0.76), compared with healthy subjects. In the multivariate model, determinants associated with sleep disturbances in bronchiectasis patients included depression (OR, 10.09; 95% CI, 3.46-29.37; P<0.001), nocturnal cough (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.13-3.18; P = 0.016), aging (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = 0.009) and increased 24-hour sputum volume (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.22-3.33; P = 0.006). Patients with sleep disturbances had more significantly impaired QoL affecting all domains than those without. Only 6.2% of patients reported using a sleep medication at least weekly.In adults with steady-state bronchiectasis, sleep disturbances are more common than in healthy subjects and are related to poorer QoL. Determinants associated with sleep disturbances include depression, aging, nighttime cough and increased sputum volume. Assessment and intervention of sleep disturbances are warranted and may improve QoL."
https://openalex.org/W2086372997,"The expanding roles of PCNA in functional assembly of DNA replication and repair complexes motivated investigation of the structural and dynamic properties guiding specificity of PCNA-protein interactions. A series of biochemical and computational analyses were combined to evaluate the PIP Box recognition features impacting complex formation. The results indicate subtle differences in topological and molecular descriptors distinguishing both affinity and stoichiometry of binding among PCNA-peptide complexes through cooperative effects. These features were validated using peptide mimics of p85α and Akt, two previously unreported PCNA binding partners. This study characterizes for the first time a reverse PIP Box interaction with PCNA. Small molecule ligand binding at the PIP Box interaction site confirmed the adaptive nature of the protein in dictating overall shape and implicates allosterism in transmitting biological effects."
https://openalex.org/W2114703897,"The cavins are a family of proteins associated with caveolae, cavin-1, -2 and -3 being widely expressed while cavin-4 is restricted to striated muscle. Deletion of cavin-1 results in phenotypes including metabolic changes consistent with adipocyte dysfunction, and caveolae are completely absent. Deletion of cavin-2 causes tissue-specific loss of caveolae. The consequences of cavin-3 deletion are less clear, as there are divergent data on the abundance of caveolae in cavin-3 null mice. Here we examine the consequences of cavin-3 deficiency in vivo by making cavin-3 knockout mice. We find that loss of cavin-3 has minimal or no effects on the levels of other caveolar proteins, does not appear to play a major role in formation of protein complexes important for caveolar morphogenesis, and has no significant effect on caveolae abundance. Cavin-3 null mice have the same body weight and fat mass as wild type animals at ages 8 through 30 weeks on both normal chow and high fat diets. Likewise, the two mouse strains exhibit identical glucose tolerance tests on both diets. Microarray analysis from adipose tissue shows that the changes in mRNA expression between cavin-3 null and wild type mouse are minimal. We conclude that cavin-3 is not absolutely required for making caveolae, and suggest that the mechanistic link between cavin-3 and metabolic regulation remains uncertain."
https://openalex.org/W2090777304,"RNA editing modifies the sequence of primary transcripts, potentially resulting in profound effects to RNA structure and protein-coding sequence. Recent analyses of RNA sequence data are beginning to provide insights into the distribution of RNA editing across the entire transcriptome, but there are few published matched whole genome and transcriptome sequence datasets, and designing accurate bioinformatics methodology has proven highly challenging. To further characterize the RNA editome, we analyzed 16 paired DNA-RNA sequence libraries from prostate tumor specimens, employing a comprehensive strategy to rescue low coverage sites and minimize false positives. We identified over a hundred thousand putative RNA editing events, a third of which were recurrent in two or more samples, and systematically characterized their type and distribution across the genome. Within genes the majority of events affect non-coding regions such as introns and untranslated regions (UTRs), but 546 genes had RNA editing events predicted to result in deleterious amino acid alterations. Finally, we report a potential association between RNA editing of microRNA binding sites within 3' UTRs and increased transcript expression. These results provide a systematic characterization of the landscape of RNA editing in low coverage sequence data from prostate tumor specimens. We demonstrate further evidence for RNA editing as an important regulatory mechanism and suggest that the RNA editome should be further studied in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2034694391,"Organizational growth processes have consistently been shown to exhibit a fatter-than-Gaussian growth-rate distribution in a variety of settings. Long periods of relatively small changes are interrupted by sudden changes in all size scales. This kind of extreme events can have important consequences for the development of biological and socio-economic systems. Existing models do not derive this aggregated pattern from agent actions at the micro level. We develop an agent-based simulation model on a social network. We take our departure in a model by a Schwarzkopf et al. on a scale-free network. We reproduce the fat-tailed pattern out of internal dynamics alone, and also find that it is robust with respect to network topology. Thus, the social network and the local interactions are a prerequisite for generating the pattern, but not the network topology itself. We further extend the model with a parameter $\delta$ that weights the relative fraction of an individual's neighbours belonging to a given organization, representing a contextual aspect of social influence. In the lower limit of this parameter, the fraction is irrelevant and choice of organization is random. In the upper limit of the parameter, the largest fraction quickly dominates, leading to a winner-takes-all situation. We recover the real pattern as an intermediate case between these two extremes."
https://openalex.org/W2164227644,"Intron-containing and intronless genes have different biological properties and statistical characteristics. Here we propose a new computational method to distinguish between intron-containing and intronless gene sequences. Seven feature parameters , , , , , , and based on detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are fully used, and thus we can compute a 7-dimensional feature vector for any given gene sequence to be discriminated. Furthermore, support vector machine (SVM) classifier with Gaussian radial basis kernel function is performed on this feature space to classify the genes into intron-containing and intronless. We investigate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with other state-of-the-art algorithms on biological datasets. The experimental results show that our new method significantly improves the accuracy over those existing techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2087036974,"The polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is a critical regulator of cell division that is overexpressed in many types of tumors. Thus, a strategy in the treatment of cancer has been to target the kinase activity (ATPase domain) or substrate-binding domain (Polo-box Domain, PBD) of Plk1. However, only few synthetic small molecules have been identified that target the Plk1-PBD. Here, we have applied an integrative approach that combines pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, virtual screening, and in vitro testing to discover novel Plk1-PBD inhibitors. Nine Plk1-PBD crystal structures were used to generate structure-based hypotheses. A common pharmacophore model (Hypo1) composed of five chemical features was selected from the 9 structure-based hypotheses and used for virtual screening of a drug-like database consisting of 159,757 compounds to identify novel Plk1-PBD inhibitors. The virtual screening technique revealed 9,327 compounds with a maximum fit value of 3 or greater, which were selected and subjected to molecular docking analyses. This approach yielded 93 compounds that made good interactions with critical residues within the Plk1-PBD active site. The testing of these 93 compounds in vitro for their ability to inhibit the Plk1-PBD, showed that many of these compounds had Plk1-PBD inhibitory activity and that compound Chemistry_28272 was the most potent Plk1-PBD inhibitor. Thus Chemistry_28272 and the other top compounds are novel Plk1-PBD inhibitors and could be used for the development of cancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2090931723,"Objectives Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale scores in English- and French-speaking Canadian systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients are commonly pooled in analyses, but no studies have evaluated the metric equivalence of the English and French CES-D. The study objective was to examine the metric equivalence of the CES-D in English- and French-speaking SSc patients. Methods The CES-D was completed by 1007 English-speaking and 248 French-speaking patients from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group Registry. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the factor structure in both samples. The Multiple-Indicator Multiple-Cause (MIMIC) model was utilized to assess differential item functioning (DIF). Results A two-factor model (Positive and Negative affect) showed excellent fit in both samples. Statistically significant, but small-magnitude, DIF was found for 3 of 20 CES-D items, including items 3 (Blues), 10 (Fearful), and 11 (Sleep). Prior to accounting for DIF, French-speaking patients had 0.08 of a standard deviation (SD) lower latent scores for the Positive factor (95% confidence interval [CI]−0.25 to 0.08) and 0.09 SD higher scores (95% CI−0.07 to 0.24) for the Negative factor than English-speaking patients. After DIF correction, there was no change on the Positive factor and a non-significant increase of 0.04 SD on the Negative factor for French-speaking patients (difference = 0.13 SD, 95% CI−0.03 to 0.28). Conclusions The English and French versions of the CES-D, despite minor DIF on several items, are substantively equivalent and can be used in studies that combine data from English- and French-speaking Canadian SSc patients."
https://openalex.org/W2087871573,"Previously reported findings in Austrian BRCA1/2 mutation carriers suggested a possible dependency of embryos with BRCA1/2 mutations on so-called low alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, characterized by less than 26 CGG repeats (CGG(n<26)). The hypothesis arose from a study reporting highly statistically significant enrichment of low FMR1 alleles, significantly exceeding low allele prevalence in a general population, suggesting embryo lethality of BRCA1/2 mutations, ""rescued"" by presence of low FMR1 alleles. Such a dependency would also offer an explanation for the so-called ""BRCA-paradox,"" characterized by BRCA1/2 deficient embryonic tissues being anti-proliferative (thereby potentially causing embryo-lethality) but proliferative in malignant tumors, including breast and ovarian cancers. Follow up investigations by other investigators, however, at most demonstrated trends towards enrichment but, mostly, no enrichment at all, raising questions about the original observation and hypothesis. We in this study, therefore, investigated CGGn of the FMR1 gene of 86 anonymized DNA samples from women with various forms of ovarian cancer, and were unable to demonstrate differences in prevalence of low FMR1 alleles either between positive and negative ovarian cancer patients for BRCA1/2 or between ovarian cancer patients and reported rates in non-cancer populations. This raises further questions about a suggested dependency between BRCA1/2 and FMR1, but also raises the possibility that investigated Austrian BRCA1/2 carrier populations differ from those in other countries. Either only selected BRCA1/2 mutations, therefore, interact with low FMR1 alleles or the Austrian data reflect only coincidental observations."
https://openalex.org/W2162456746,"Developing a high-throughput method for the effecient selection of the highest producing cell is very important for the production of recombinant protein drugs. Here, we developed a novel transiently protein-anchored system coupled with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for the efficient selection of the highest producing cell. A furin cleavage peptide (RAKR) was used to join a human anti-epithelial growth factor antibody (αEGFR Ab) and the extracellular-transmembrane-cytosolic domains of the mouse B7-1 antigen (B7). The furin inhibitor can transiently switch secreted αEGFR Ab into a membrane-anchored form. After cell sorting, the level of membrane αEGFR Ab-RAKR-B7 is proportional to the amount of secreted αEGFR Ab in the medium. We further selected 23 αEGFR Ab expressing cells and demonstrated a high correlation (R2 = 0.9165) between the secretion level and surface expression levels of αEGFR Ab. These results suggested that the novel transiently protein-anchored system can easily and efficiently select the highest producing cells, reducing the cost for the production of biopharmaceuticals."
https://openalex.org/W2133193447,"Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common sexually transmitted disease, but there is limited data on its epidemiology among urban populations. The urban Emergency Department (ED) is a potential venue for surveillance as it predominantly serves an inner city minority population. We evaluate the seroprevalence and factors associated with HSV-2 infection among patients attending the Johns Hopkins Hospital Adult Emergency Department (JHH ED).An identity unlinked-serosurvey was conducted between 6/2007 and 9/2007 in the JHH ED; sera were tested by the Focus HerpeSelect ELISA. Prevalence risk ratios (PRR) were used to determine factors associated with HSV-2 infection.Of 3,408 serum samples, 1,853 (54.4%) were seropositive for HSV-2. Females (adjPRR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.38-1.56), non-Hispanic blacks (adjPRR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.82-2.27), single (adjPRR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.25), divorced (adjPRR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.15-1.41), and unemployed patients (adjPRR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.05-1.21) had significantly higher rates of HSV-2 infection. Though certain zip codes had significantly higher seroprevalence of HSV-2, this effect was completely attenuated when controlling for age and gender.Seroprevalence of HSV-2 in the JHH ED was higher than U.S. national estimates; however, factors associated with HSV-2 infection were similar. The high seroprevalence of HSV-2 in this urban ED highlights the need for targeted testing and treatment. Cross-sectional serosurveys in the urban ED may help to examine the epidemiology of HSV-2."
https://openalex.org/W2113735091,"Mutations in three human RecQ genes are implicated in heritable human syndromes. Mutations in BLM, a RecQ gene, cause Bloom syndrome (BS), which is characterized by short stature, cancer predisposition, and sensitivity to sunlight. BLM is a RecQ DNA helicase that, with interacting proteins, is able to dissolve various DNA structures including double Holliday junctions. A BLM ortholog, him-6, has been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, but little is known about its enzymatic activities or its in vivo roles. By purifying recombinant HIM-6 and performing biochemical assays, we determined that the HIM-6 has DNA-dependent ATPase activity HIM-6 and helicase activity that proceeds in the 3'-5' direction and needs at least five 3' overhanging nucleotides. HIM-6 is also able to unwind DNA structures including D-loops and Holliday junctions. Worms with him-6 mutations were defective in recovering the cell cycle arrest after HU treatment. These activities strongly support in vivo roles for HIM-6 in processing recombination intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2002585611,"The use of dry gases during mechanical ventilation has been associated with the risk of serious airway complications. The goal of the present study was to quantify the plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 and to determine the radiological, hemodynamic, gasometric, and microscopic changes in lung mechanics in dogs subjected to short-term mechanical ventilation with and without humidification of the inhaled gas. The experiment was conducted for 24 hours in 10 dogs divided into two groups: Group I (n = 5), mechanical ventilation with dry oxygen dispensation, and Group II (n = 5), mechanical ventilation with oxygen dispensation using a moisture chamber. Variance analysis was used. No changes in physiological, hemodynamic, or gasometric, and radiographic constants were observed. Plasma TNF-alpha levels increased in group I, reaching a maximum 24 hours after mechanical ventilation was initiated (ANOVA p = 0.77). This increase was correlated to changes in mechanical ventilation. Plasma IL-6 levels decreased at 12 hours and increased again towards the end of the study (ANOVA p>0.05). Both groups exhibited a decrease in lung compliance and functional residual capacity values, but this was more pronounced in group I. Pplat increased in group I (ANOVA p = 0.02). Inhalation of dry gas caused histological lesions in the entire respiratory tract, including pulmonary parenchyma, to a greater extent than humidified gas. Humidification of inspired gases can attenuate damage associated with mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2080335776,"Phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases), which play an essential role in both primary and secondary metabolism, are magnesium binding enzymes. In this study, we characterized the magnesium binding residues of all known group II PPTases by biochemical and evolutionary analysis. Our results suggested that group II PPTases could be classified into two subgroups, two-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTases containing the triad Asp-Xxx-Glu and three-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTases containing the triad Asp-Glu-Glu. Mutations of two three-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTases and one two-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTase indicate that the first and the third residues in the triads are essential to activities; the second residues in the triads are non-essential. Although variations of the second residues in the triad Asp-Xxx-Glu exist throughout the whole phylogenetic tree, the second residues are conserved in animals, plants, algae, and most prokaryotes, respectively. Evolutionary analysis suggests that: the animal group II PPTases may originate from one common ancestor; the plant two-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTases may originate from one common ancestor; the plant three-magnesium-binding-residue-PPTases may derive from horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2082035045,"Elk1 belongs to the ternary complex (TCF) subfamily of the ETS-domain transcription factors. Several studies have implicated an important function for Elk1 in the CNS including synaptic plasticity and cell differentiation. Whilst studying ELK1 gene expression in rat brain a 54 aa N-terminally truncated isoform lacking the DBD was observed on immunoblots. A similar protein was also detected in NGF differentiated PC12 cells. It was proposed that this protein, referred to as sElk1, arose due to a de-novo initiation event at the second AUG codon on the Elk1 ORF. Transient over-expression of sElk1 potentiated neurite growth in the PC12 model and induced differentiation in the absence of NGF, leading to the proposition that it may have a specific function in the CNS. Here we report on the translational expression from the mouse and rat transcript and compare it with our earlier published work on human. Results demonstrate that the previously observed sElk1 protein is a non-specific band arising from the antibody employed. The tight conservation of the internal AUG reported to drive sElk1 expression is in fact coupled to Elk1 protein function, a result consistent with the Elk1-SRE crystal structure. It is also supported by the observed conservation of this methionine in the DBD of all ETS transcription factors independent of the N- or C-terminal positioning of this domain. Reporter assays demonstrate that elements both within the 5′UTR and downstream of the AUGElk1 serve to limit 40S access to the AUGsElk1 codon."
