https://openalex.org/W2991341799,"Immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated efficacy in many tumor types, but predictors of responsiveness to anti-PD1 ICB are incompletely characterized. In this study, we analyzed a clinically annotated cohort of patients with melanoma (n = 144) treated with anti-PD1 ICB, with whole-exome and whole-transcriptome sequencing of pre-treatment tumors. We found that tumor mutational burden as a predictor of response was confounded by melanoma subtype, whereas multiple novel genomic and transcriptomic features predicted selective response, including features associated with MHC-I and MHC-II antigen presentation. Furthermore, previous anti-CTLA4 ICB exposure was associated with different predictors of response compared to tumors that were naive to ICB, suggesting selective immune effects of previous exposure to anti-CTLA4 ICB. Finally, we developed parsimonious models integrating clinical, genomic and transcriptomic features to predict intrinsic resistance to anti-PD1 ICB in individual tumors, with validation in smaller independent cohorts limited by the availability of comprehensive data. Broadly, we present a framework to discover predictive features and build models of ICB therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2990669650,"B-cell lymphoma extra large (BCL-XL) is a well-validated cancer target. However, the on-target and dose-limiting thrombocytopenia limits the use of BCL-XL inhibitors, such as ABT263, as safe and effective anticancer agents. To reduce the toxicity of ABT263, we converted it into DT2216, a BCL-XL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), that targets BCL-XL to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase for degradation. We found that DT2216 was more potent against various BCL-XL-dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT263 in vitro because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets. In vivo, DT2216 effectively inhibits the growth of several xenograft tumors as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, without causing appreciable thrombocytopenia. These findings demonstrate the potential to use PROTAC technology to reduce on-target drug toxicities and rescue the therapeutic potential of previously undruggable targets. Furthermore, DT2216 may be developed as a safe first-in-class anticancer agent targeting BCL-XL."
https://openalex.org/W2990851413,"Proteins are effector molecules that mediate the functions of genes1,2 and modulate comorbidities3-10, behaviors and drug treatments11. They represent an enormous potential resource for personalized, systemic and data-driven diagnosis, prevention, monitoring and treatment. However, the concept of using plasma proteins for individualized health assessment across many health conditions simultaneously has not been tested. Here, we show that plasma protein expression patterns strongly encode for multiple different health states, future disease risks and lifestyle behaviors. We developed and validated protein-phenotype models for 11 different health indicators: liver fat, kidney filtration, percentage body fat, visceral fat mass, lean body mass, cardiopulmonary fitness, physical activity, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, diabetes risk and primary cardiovascular event risk. The analyses were prospectively planned, documented and executed at scale on archived samples and clinical data, with a total of ~85 million protein measurements in 16,894 participants. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that protein expression patterns reliably encode for many different health issues, and that large-scale protein scanning12-16 coupled with machine learning is viable for the development and future simultaneous delivery of multiple measures of health. We anticipate that, with further validation and the addition of more protein-phenotype models, this approach could enable a single-source, individualized so-called liquid health check."
https://openalex.org/W2989595882,"The clinical and pathological differences between synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy have been postulated to stem from unique strains of α-synuclein aggregates, akin to what occurs in prion diseases. Here we demonstrate that inoculation of transgenic mice with different strains of recombinant or brain-derived α-synuclein aggregates produces clinically and pathologically distinct diseases. Strain-specific differences were observed in the signs of neurological illness, time to disease onset, morphology of cerebral α-synuclein deposits and the conformational properties of the induced aggregates. Moreover, different strains targeted distinct cellular populations and cell types within the brain, recapitulating the selective targeting observed among human synucleinopathies. Strain-specific clinical, pathological and biochemical differences were faithfully maintained after serial passaging, which implies that α-synuclein propagates via prion-like conformational templating. Thus, pathogenic α-synuclein exhibits key hallmarks of prion strains, which provides evidence that disease heterogeneity among the synucleinopathies is caused by distinct α-synuclein strains."
https://openalex.org/W2989769687,"How obesity and elevated androgen levels in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affect their offspring is unclear. In a Swedish nationwide register-based cohort and a clinical case-control study from Chile, we found that daughters of mothers with PCOS were more likely to be diagnosed with PCOS. Furthermore, female mice (F0) with PCOS-like traits induced by late-gestation injection of dihydrotestosterone, with and without obesity, produced female F1-F3 offspring with PCOS-like reproductive and metabolic phenotypes. Sequencing of single metaphase II oocytes from F1-F3 offspring revealed common and unique altered gene expression across all generations. Notably, four genes were also differentially expressed in serum samples from daughters in the case-control study and unrelated women with PCOS. Our findings provide evidence of transgenerational effects in female offspring of mothers with PCOS and identify possible candidate genes for the prediction of a PCOS phenotype in future generations."
https://openalex.org/W2991987583,"To make appropriate decisions, animals need to accumulate sensory evidence. Simple integrator models can explain many aspects of such behavior, but how the underlying computations are mechanistically implemented in the brain remains poorly understood. Here we approach this problem by adapting the random-dot motion discrimination paradigm, classically used in primate studies, to larval zebrafish. Using their innate optomotor response as a measure of decision making, we find that larval zebrafish accumulate and remember motion evidence over many seconds and that the behavior is in close agreement with a bounded leaky integrator model. Through the use of brain-wide functional imaging, we identify three neuronal clusters in the anterior hindbrain that are well suited to execute the underlying computations. By relating the dynamics within these structures to individual behavioral choices, we propose a biophysically plausible circuit arrangement in which an evidence integrator competes against a dynamic decision threshold to activate a downstream motor command."
https://openalex.org/W2994381402,"A conspiracy theory refers to an alternative explanation of an event involving a conspirator plot organised by powerful people or organisations. Belief in conspiracy theories is related to negative societal outcomes such as poor medical decisions and a decrease in prosocial behaviour. Given these negative outcomes, researchers have explored predictors of belief in conspiracy theories in an attempt to understand and possibly manage these beliefs. In the current study, we explored the utility of personality in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. The aim of the current study was to explore the utility of the odd beliefs/magical thinking subtype of schizotypy, Machiavellianism, grandiose narcissism, vulnerable narcissism, primary psychopathy, and secondary psychopathy in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. Participants (N = 230; 44.7% male, 55.3% female) completed an anonymous, confidential online questionnaire which comprised demographics and measures of personality traits and belief in conspiracy theories. The total regression model indicated odd beliefs/magical thinking, trait Machiavellianism, and primary psychopathy were significant, positive predictors of belief in conspiracy theories. No other predictors reached significance. Results of the current study highlight individuals who might be more susceptible to believing conspiracy theories. Specifically, these results indicate that the individual more likely to believe in conspiracy theories may have unusual patterns of thinking and cognitions, be strategic and manipulative, and display interpersonal and affective deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2992008718,"Metabolomic approaches have been used to identify new diagnostic biomarkers for various types of cancers, including breast cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers of breast cancer using plasma metabolic profiling. Furthermore, we analyzed whether these biomarkers had relationships with clinicopathological characteristics of breast cancer. Our study used two liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry sets: a discovery set (40 breast cancer patients and 30 healthy controls) and a validation set (30 breast cancer patients and 16 healthy controls). All breast cancer patients were randomly selected from among stage I-III patients who underwent surgery between 2011 and 2016. First, metabolites distinguishing cancer patients from healthy controls were identified in the discovery set. Then, consistent and reproducible metabolites were evaluated in terms of their utility as possible biomarkers of breast cancer. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to the discovery set, and ROC cut-off values for the identified metabolites derived therein were applied to the validation set to determine their diagnostic performance. Ultimately, four candidate biomarkers (L-octanoylcarnitine, 5-oxoproline, hypoxanthine, and docosahexaenoic acid) were identified. L-octanoylcarnitine showed the best diagnostic performance, with a 100.0% positive predictive value. Also, L-octanoylcarnitine levels differed according to tumor size and hormone receptor expression. The plasma metabolites identified in this study show potential as biomarkers allowing early diagnosis of breast cancer. However, the diagnostic performance of the metabolites needs to be confirmed in further studies with larger sample sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2993460533,"Cocaine-associated memories are persistent, but, on retrieval, become temporarily destabilized and vulnerable to disruptions, followed by reconsolidation. To explore the synaptic underpinnings for these memory dynamics, we studied AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-silent excitatory synapses, which are generated in the nucleus accumbens by cocaine self-administration, and subsequently mature after prolonged withdrawal by recruiting AMPARs, echoing acquisition and consolidation of cocaine memories. We show that, on memory retrieval after prolonged withdrawal, the matured silent synapses become AMPAR-silent again, followed by re-maturation ~6 h later, defining the onset and termination of a destabilization window of cocaine memories. These synaptic dynamics are timed by Rac1, with decreased and increased Rac1 activities opening and closing, respectively, the silent synapse-mediated destabilization window. Preventing silent synapse re-maturation within the destabilization window decreases cue-induced cocaine seeking. Thus, cocaine-generated silent synapses constitute a discrete synaptic ensemble dictating the dynamics of cocaine-associated memories and can be targeted for memory disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2993863748,"Beneficial microorganisms are generally known to activate plant defense against biotic challenges. However, the molecular mechanisms by which activated plants react more rapidly and actively to pests remain still largely unclear. Tomato plants pre-treated with a mixture of beneficial bio-control agents (BCAs), as soil-drenches, were less sensitive to infection of the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita. To unravel the molecular mechanisms of this induced resistance against RKNs, we used qRT-PCR to monitor the expression, in tomato roots and leaves, of 6 key defense genes. Gene transcripts were detected until the 12th day after BCA treatment(3, 7, 8, 12 dpt) and3 and 7 days after nematode inoculation of pre-treated plants. Early after BCA treatment, the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent pathogenesis related gene (PR-gene), PR-1b, marker of the systemic acquired resistance (SAR), was systemically over-expressed. Another PR-gene, PR-5, was over-expressed at later stages of BCA-plant interaction, and only in roots. Activation of defense against RKNs was attested by the early up-regulation of 4 genes (PR-1, PR-3, PR-5, ACO) in pre-treated plants after inoculation. Conversely, the expression of the JA/ET-dependent gene JERF3 did not increase after nematode inoculation in primed plants. A catalase gene (CAT)was highly over-expressed by nematode infection, however, this over-expression was annulled at the earliest stages or limited at the later stages of infection toBCA-treated roots. Enzyme activities, such as glucanase and endochitinase, were enhanced in roots of pre-treated inoculated plants with respect to plants left not inoculated as a control. These findings indicate that BCA interaction with roots primes plants against RKNs. BCA-mediated immunity seems to rely on SA-mediated SAR and to be associated with both the activation of chitinase and glucanase enzyme activities and the inhibition of the plant antioxidant enzyme system. Immunity is triggered at the penetration and movements inside the roots of the invading nematode juveniles but probably acts at the feeding site building stage of nematode infection."

https://openalex.org/W2991731838,"Introduction Surveillance of physical activity at the population level increases the knowledge on levels and trends of physical activity, which may support public health initiatives to promote physical activity. Physical activity assessed by accelerometry is challenged by varying data processing procedures, which influences the outcome. We aimed to describe the levels and prevalence estimates of physical activity, and to examine how triaxial and uniaxial accelerometry data influences these estimates, in a large population-based cohort of Norwegian adults. Methods This cross-sectional study included 5918 women and men aged 40–84 years who participated in the seventh wave of the Tromsø Study (2015–16). The participants wore an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer attached to the hip for 24 hours per day over seven consecutive days. Accelerometry variables were expressed as volume (counts·minute-1 and steps·day-1) and as minutes per day in sedentary, light physical activity and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results From triaxial accelerometry data, 22% (95% confidence interval (CI): 21–23%) of the participants fulfilled the current global recommendations for physical activity (≥150 minutes of MVPA per week in ≥10-minute bouts), while 70% (95% CI: 69–71%) accumulated ≥150 minutes of non-bouted MVPA per week. When analysing uniaxial data, 18% fulfilled the current recommendations (i.e. 20% difference compared with triaxial data), and 55% (95% CI: 53–56%) accumulated ≥150 minutes of non-bouted MVPA per week. We observed approximately 100 less minutes of sedentary time and 90 minutes more of light physical activity from triaxial data compared with uniaxial data (p<0.001). Conclusion The prevalence estimates of sufficiently active adults and elderly are more than three times higher (22% vs. 70%) when comparing triaxial bouted and non-bouted MVPA. Physical activity estimates are highly dependent on accelerometry data processing criteria and on different definitions of physical activity recommendations, which may influence prevalence estimates and tracking of physical activity patterns over time."
https://openalex.org/W2993290199,"As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2992257560,"In a follow-up to our work on the dependence of walking dyad dynamics on intrinsic properties of the group, we now analyse how these properties affect groups of three people (triads), taking also in consideration the effect of social interaction on the dynamical properties of the group. We show that there is a strong parallel between triads and dyads. Work-oriented groups are faster and walk at a larger distance between them than leisure-oriented ones, while the latter move in a less ordered way. Such differences are present also when colleagues are contrasted with friends and families; nevertheless the similarity between friend and colleague behaviour is greater than the one between family and colleague behaviour. Male triads walk faster than triads including females, males keep a larger distance than females, and same gender groups are more ordered than mixed ones. Groups including tall people walk faster, while those with elderly or children walk at a slower pace. Groups including children move in a less ordered fashion. Results concerning relation and gender are particularly strong, and we investigated whether they hold also when other properties are kept fixed. While this is clearly true for relation, patterns relating gender often resulted to be diminished. For instance, the velocity difference due to gender is reduced if we compare only triads in the colleague relation. The effects on group dynamics due to intrinsic properties are present regardless of social interaction, but socially interacting groups are found to walk in a more ordered way. This has an opposite effect on the space occupied by non-interacting dyads and triads, since loss of structure makes dyads larger, but causes triads to lose their characteristic V formation and walk in a line (i.e., occupying more space in the direction of movement but less space in the orthogonal one)."
https://openalex.org/W2991801759,"Selecting appropriate reference genes is vital to normalize gene expression analysis in birch (Betula platyphylla) under different abiotic stress conditions using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). In this study, 11 candidate birch reference genes (ACT, TUA, TUB, TEF, 18S rRNA, EF1α, GAPDH, UBC, YLS8, SAND, and CDPK) were selected to evaluate the stability of their expression in different tissues and under different abiotic stress conditions. Three statistical algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to analyze the stability of the 11 candidate reference genes to identify the most appropriate one. The results indicated that EF-1α was the most stable reference gene in different birch tissues, ACT was the most stable reference gene for normal conditions, ACT and TEF were the most stable reference genes for salt stress treatment, TUB was the most stable reference gene for osmotic stress treatment, and ACT was the most appropriate choice in all samples of birch. In conclusion, the most appropriate reference genes varied among different experimental conditions. However, in this study, ACT was the optimum reference gene in all experimental groups, except in the different tissues group. GAPDH was the least stable candidate reference gene in all experimental conditions. In addition, three stress-induced genes (BpGRAS1, BpGRAS16, and BpGRAS19) were chosen to verify the stability of the selected reference genes in different tissues and under salt stress. This study laid the foundation for the selection of appropriate reference gene(s) for future gene expression pattern studies in birch."
https://openalex.org/W2993503274,"Meta-analytic findings indicate that the success of unmasking a deceptive interaction relies more on the performance of the liar than on that of the lie detector. Despite this finding, the lie characteristics and strategies of deception that enable good liars to evade detection are largely unknown. We conducted a survey (n = 194) to explore the association between laypeople’s self-reported ability to deceive on the one hand, and their lie prevalence, characteristics, and deception strategies in daily life on the other. Higher self-reported ratings of deception ability were positively correlated with self-reports of telling more lies per day, telling inconsequential lies, lying to colleagues and friends, and communicating lies via face-to-face interactions. We also observed that self-reported good liars highly relied on verbal strategies of deception and they most commonly reported to i) embed their lies into truthful information, ii) keep the statement clear and simple, and iii) provide a plausible account. This study provides a starting point for future research exploring the meta-cognitions and patterns of skilled liars who may be most likely to evade detection."
https://openalex.org/W2991850273,"Objectives To estimate the prevalence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) or sports in the Brazilian population according to demographic and income variables. Methods Data from 60,202 Brazilian individuals (18 years and over) were analyzed, belonging to the National Health Survey 2013 sample. The prevalence of different modalities of LTPA and sports was estimated according to age, sex, skin color and income. The adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. Results Of every thousand Brazilians, 695 do not practice LTPA or sports. Walking is the most practiced LTPA (98/1000), followed by soccer (68/1000) and weight training (45/1000). For poor and black men, the most frequent LTPA was soccer, and, for women, gymnastics and walking. The prevalence of weight training and gymnastics was higher for white people compared with black people. All LTPA practices were more prevalent in individuals with higher income, except for soccer. Running on a treadmill and weight training had, respectively, 24.7 and 6.4 times higher prevalence in the richer quartile. Conclusions The study allowed identifying the type of LTPA and sport reported as the most frequent by the Brazilian population according to age, sex, skin color, and income, detecting strong social disparities in these practices."
https://openalex.org/W2992243393,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage degradation and chronic joint inflammation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in OA, but their mechanism of action is not fully understood. We hypothesize that MSCs polarize macrophages, which are strongly associated with joint inflammation to more homeostatic sub-types. We tracked ferumoxytol (Feraheme™, iron oxide nanoparticle)-labeled murine MSCs (Fe-MSCs) in murine OA joints, and quantified changes to joint inflammation and fibrosis. 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 5/group) were induced to undergo osteoarthritis by destabilization of medical meniscus (DMM) or sham surgery. 3 weeks post-surgery, mice were injected intra-articularly with either fluorescent dye-(DiR) labeled or DiR-Fe-MSC or saline to yield 4 groups (n = 5 per group for each timepoint [1, 2 and 4weeks]). 4 weeks after injection, mice were imaged by MRI, and scored for i) OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) to determine cartilage damage; ii) immunohistochemical changes in iNOS, CD206, F4/80 and Prussian Blue/Sca-1 to detect pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and total macrophages and ferumoxytol -labeled MSCs respectively, and iii) Masson’s Trichrome to detect changes in fibrosis. Ferumoxytol-labeled MSCs persisted at greater levels in DMM vs. SHAM-knee joints. We observed no difference in OARSI scores between MSC and vehicle groups. Sca-1 and Prussian Blue co-staining confirmed the ferumoxytol label resides in MSCs, although some ferumoxytol label was detected in proximity to MSCs in macrophages, likely due to phagocytosis of apoptotic MSCs, increasing functionality of these macrophages through MSC efferocytosis. MRI hypertintensity scores related to fluid edema decreased in MSC-treated vs. control animals. For the first time, we show that MSC-treated mice had increased ratios of %CD206+: %F4/80+ (homeostatic macrophages) (p<0.05), and decreased ratios of %iNOS+: %F4/80+ macrophages (p<0.01), supporting our hypothesis that MSCs may modulate synovial inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2994022960,"Temper outbursts are a severe problem for people with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Previous reports indicate that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may reduce maladaptive behaviour in neurodevelopmental disorders, including PWS. We systematically investigated the effectiveness of transcutaneous VNS (t-VNS) in PWS. Using a non-blind single case repeat measures modified ABA design, with participants as their own controls, t-VNS was evaluated in five individuals with PWS [three males; age 22-41 (M = 26.8)]. After a baseline phase, participants received four-hours of t-VNS daily for 12 months, followed by one month of daily t-VNS for two-hours. The primary outcome measure was the mean number of behavioural outbursts per day. Secondary outcomes included findings from behavioural questionnaires and both qualitative and goal attainment interviews. Four of the five participants who completed the study exhibited a statistically significant reduction in number and severity of temper outbursts after approximately nine months of daily four-hour t-VNS. Subsequent two-hour daily t-VNS was associated with increased outbursts for all participants, two reaching significance. Questionnaire and interview data supported these findings, the latter indicating potential mechanisms of action. No serious safety issues were reported. t-VNS is an effective, novel and safe intervention for chronic temper outbursts in PWS. We propose these changes are mediated through vagal projections and their effects both centrally and on the functioning of the parasympathetic nervous system. These findings challenge our present biopsychosocial understanding of such behaviours suggesting that there is a single major mechanism that is modifiable using t-VNS. This intervention is potentially generalizable across other clinical groups. Future research should address the lack of a sham condition in this study along with the prevalence of high drop out rates, and the potential effects of different stimulation intensities, frequencies and pulse widths."
https://openalex.org/W2994230420,"Background Hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection remains an important public health concern particularly in Africa. Between 1990 and 2013, Hepatitis B mortality increased by 63%. In recent times, effective antiviral agents against HBV such as Nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) are available. These drugs are capable of suppressing HBV replication, preventing progression of chronic Hepatitis B to cirrhosis, and reducing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. Notwithstanding, these treatments are underused despite their effectiveness in managing Hepatitis B. This study sought to explore barriers to treatment and care for people with Hepatitis B (PWHB) in Ghana, paying particular attention to beliefs about aetiology that can act as a barrier to care for PWHB. Methods We used an exploratory qualitative design with a purposive sampling technique. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for 18 persons with Hepatitis B (PWHB) and 15 healthcare providers (HCP; physicians, nurses, and midwives). In addition, four focus group discussions (FGD) with a composition of eight HCPs in each group were done. Participants were recruited from one tertiary and one regional hospital in Ghana. Data were processed using QSR Nvivo version 10.0 and analysed using the procedure of inductive thematic analysis. Participants were recruited from one tertiary and one regional hospital in Ghana. Results Three main cultural beliefs regarding the aetiology of chronic Hepatitis B that act as barriers to care and treatment were identified. These were: (1) the belief that chronic Hepatitis B is a punishment from the gods to those who touch dead bodies without permission from their landlords, (2) the belief that bewitchment contributes to chronic Hepatitis B, and (3) the belief that chronic Hepatitis B is caused by spiritual poison. Furthermore, individual level barriers were identified. These were the absence of chronic Hepatitis B signs and symptoms, perceived efficacy of traditional herbal medicine, and PWHB’s perception that formal care does not meet their expectations. Health system-related barriers included high cost of hospital-based care and inadequate Hepatitis B education for patients from HCPs. Conclusion Given that high cost of hospital based care was considered an important barrier to engagement in care for PWHB, we recommend including the required Hepatitis B laboratory investigations such as viral load, and the recommended treatment in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Also, we recommend increasing health care providers and PWHB Hepatitis B knowledge and capacity in a culturally sensitive fashion, discuss with patients (1) myths about aetiology and the lack of efficacy of traditional herbal medicines, and (2) patients’ expectations of care and the need to monitor even in the absence of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2993351125,"Sensory signals give rise to patterns of neural activity, which the brain uses to infer properties of the environment. For the visual system, considerable work has focused on the representation of frontoparallel stimulus features and binocular disparities. However, inferring the properties of the physical environment from retinal stimulation is a distinct and more challenging computational problem-this is what the brain must actually accomplish to support perception and action. Here we develop a computational model that incorporates projective geometry, mapping the three-dimensional (3D) environment onto the two retinae. We demonstrate that this mapping fundamentally shapes the tuning of cortical neurons and corresponding aspects of perception. For 3D motion, the model explains the strikingly non-canonical tuning present in existing electrophysiological data and distinctive patterns of perceptual errors evident in human behavior. Decoding the world from cortical activity is strongly affected by the geometry that links the environment to the sensory epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2994510752,"To address the need for sensitive high-throughput assays to analyse avian innate and adaptive immune responses, we developed and validated a highly multiplexed qPCR 96.96 Fluidigm Dynamic Array to analyse the transcription of chicken immune-related genes. This microfluidic system permits the simultaneous analysis of expression of 96 transcripts in 96 samples in 6 nanolitre reactions and the 9,216 reactions are ready for interpretation immediately. A panel of 89 genes was selected from an RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptional response of chicken macrophages, dendritic cells and heterophils to agonists of innate immunity and from published transcriptome data. Assays were confirmed to be highly specific by amplicon sequencing and melting curve analysis and the reverse transcription and preamplification steps were optimised. The array was applied to RNA of various tissues from a commercial line of broiler chickens housed at two different levels of biosecurity. Gut-associated lymphoid tissues, bursa, spleen and peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated and transcript levels for immune-related genes were defined. The results identified blood cells as a potentially reliable indicator of immune responses among all the tissues tested with the highest number of genes significantly differentially transcribed between birds housed under varying biosecurity levels. Conventional qPCR analysis of three differentially transcribed genes confirmed the results from the multiplex qPCR array. A highly multiplexed qPCR-based platform for evaluation of chicken immune responses has been optimised and validated using samples from commercial chickens. Apart from applications in selective breeding programmes, the array could be used to analyse the complex interplay between the avian immune system and pathogens by including pathogen-specific probes, to screen vaccine responses, and as a predictive tool for immune robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2992221561,"Food waste has a great impact on food and nutrition security, the environment, and global, regional as well as national economies. However, little is known about the associated nutrient loss embedded in wasted foods, especially in developing countries, with Lebanon being a case in point. The present paper uses data gathered from a survey of 250 households conducted in Beirut, Lebanon, in which respondents filled 7-day food waste diaries in order to investigate the drivers of food waste generation at the household level and its dietary content. The results show that food waste is approximately 0.2 kg per capita per day in urban Lebanon. This wasted food contains on average 451.2 kcal, 37.5 g carbohydrates, 14.9 g protein, 2.9 g dietary fiber, 2.4 μg vitamin D, 165.2 mg calcium and 343.2 mg potassium. Furthermore, a Tobit analysis of the socio-demographic and behavioral drivers of food waste generation was conducted. This analysis shows that being the sole homeowner, spending more on food, having a larger number of household members, being ready to eat everything prepared, and tending not to buy special offers, significantly increases household food waste generation, at least in terms of physical weight. This is the first study conducted in Lebanon and the Middle East aiming at investigating food waste, and the associated nutrient loss as well as the drivers of food waste generation at the household level. This work could help provide evidence for policymakers to address both food and nutrition security issues in Lebanon."
https://openalex.org/W2994094073,"Background The aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of robot-assisted unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to those of conventional UKA in Asian patients. Methods Fifty-five patients underwent robot-assisted UKA and 57 patients underwent conventional UKA were assessed in this study. Preoperative and postoperative range of motion (ROM), American Knee Society (AKS) score, Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index scale score (WOMAC), and patellofemoral (PF) score values were compared between the two groups. The mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA) and Kennedy zone were also measured. Coronal alignments of the femoral and tibial components and posterior slopes of the tibial component were compared. Additionally, polyethylene (PE) liner thicknesses were compared. Results There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding postoperative ROM, AKS, WOMAC and PF score. Robot group showed fewer radiologic outliers in terms of mFTA and coronal alignment of tibial and femoral components (p = 0.022, 0.037, 0.003). The two groups showed significantly different PE liner thicknesses (8.4 ± 0.8 versus 8.8 ± 0.9, p = 0.035). Robot group was the only influencing factor for reducing radiologic outlier (postoperative mFTA) in multivariate model (odds ratio: 2.833, p = 0.037). Conclusion In this study, robot-assisted UKA had many advantages over conventional UKA, such as its ability to achieve precise implant insertion and reduce radiologic outliers. Although the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted UKA over a short-term follow-up period were not significantly different compared to those of conventional UKA, longer follow-up period is needed to determine whether the improved radiologic accuracy of the components in robotic-assisted UKA will lead to better clinical outcomes and improved long-term survival."
https://openalex.org/W2993784454,"Understanding the effects of individual awareness on epidemic phenomena is important to comprehend the coevolving system dynamic, to improve forecasting, and to better evaluate the outcome of possible interventions. In previous models of epidemics on social networks, individual awareness has often been approximated as a generic personal trait that depends on social reinforcement, and used to introduce variability in state transition probabilities. A novelty of this work is to assume that individual awareness is a function of several contributing factors pooled together, different by nature and dynamics, and to study it for different epidemic categories. This way, our model still has awareness as the core attribute that may change state transition probabilities. Another contribution is to study positive and negative variations of awareness, in a contagion-behavior model. Imitation is the key mechanism that we model for manipulating awareness, under different network settings and assumptions, in particular regarding the degree of intentionality that individuals may exhibit in spreading an epidemic. Three epidemic categories are considered-disease, addiction, and rumor-to discuss different imitation mechanisms and degree of intentionality. We assume a population with a heterogeneous distribution of awareness and different response mechanisms to information gathered from the network. With simulations, we show the interplay between population and awareness factors producing a distribution of state transition probabilities and analyze how different network and epidemic configurations modify transmission patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2993898133,"This study uses a laboratory experiment to examine whether prior knowledge of food fraud persistently affects consumer behavior. We invited regular consumers of olive oil to participate in an olive oil valuation experiment. We used a within-subject design to compare consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for Italian extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) before and after receiving information about labeling scandals in the Italian olive oil industry. After the first round of bidding, but before introducing information about labeling scandals or otherwise mentioning food fraud, we surveyed participants about whether they had heard of food fraud. Results indicate that prior knowledge of food fraud plays an important role in explaining consumers' valuation behavior, both in the pre-information baseline bidding and in how they update their valuation in response to information about a food fraud scandal. Consumers who reported prior knowledge of food fraud partially accounted for the possibility of food fraud in their initial pre-information valuation, submitting significantly lower bids than participants who did not report prior knowledge. They also reacted less to olive oil fraud information than consumers who reported no prior knowledge of food fraud. Findings of this study highlight the potential long-term consequences of increasing consumer awareness of food fraud incidents on consumer WTP for products in industries that have experienced food fraud scandals."
https://openalex.org/W2994410082,"Objective The aims were to describe VO2peak, explore the potential influence of anthropometrics, demographics and level of physical activity within each cohort; b) to define common, standardized activities as percentages of VO2peak and categorize these as light, moderate and vigorous intensity levels according to present classification systems, and c) to explore how clinically accessible methods such as heart-rate monitoring and Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) correlate or can describe light, moderate and vigorous intensity levels. Design Cross sectional. Setting Rehabilitation facility and laboratory environment. Subjects Sixty-three individuals, thirty-seven (10 women) with motor-complete paraplegia (MCP), T7-T12, and twenty-six (7 women) with motor-complete tetraplegia (MCT), C5-C8. Interventions VO2peak was obtained during a graded peak test until exhaustion, and oxygen uptake during eleven different activities was assessed and categorized using indirect calorimetry. Main outcome measures VO2peak, Absolute and relative oxygen consumption, Borg RPE. Results Absolute VO2peak was significantly higher in men than in women for both groups, with fairly small differences in relative VO2peak. For MCP sex, weight and time spent in vigorous-intensity activity explained 63% of VO2peak variance. For MCT sex and time in vigorous-intensity activity explained 55% of the variance. Moderate intensity corresponds to 61–72% HRpeak and RPE 10–13 for MCP vs. 71–79% HRpeak, RPE 13–14 for MCT. Conclusion Using current classification systems, eleven commonly performed activities were categorized in relative intensity terms, (light, moderate and vigorous) based on percent of VO2peak, HRpeak and Borg RPE. This categorization enables clinicians to better guide persons with SCI to meet required physical activity levels."

https://openalex.org/W2993098684,"Systemic inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) represents an effective and established treatment option for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The current study investigated in mice if a liver selective knock-down of dpp4 by therapeutic siRNAs could be a novel, similarly effective treatment option for T2D. Furthermore, the potential effects on hepatic steatosis, inflammation and lipid metabolism were investigated after hepato-selective knock-down of dpp4. The knock-down efficiency and IC50 values of siRNAs targeting dpp4 were analyzed in PC3 cells. In two independent studies, either db/db mice or C57BL/6J mice were injected intravenously with a liposomal formulation of siRNAs targeting either dpp4 or a non-targeting control, followed by metabolically characterization. In comparator groups, additional cohorts of mice were treated with an oral dpp4 inhibitor. In both animal studies, we observed a robust knock-down (~75%) of hepatic dpp4 with a potent siRNA. Hepatic dpp4 knockdown did not significantly affect glucose metabolism or circulating incretin concentrations in both animal studies. However, in obese and diabetic db/db mice hepatic steatosis was reduced and hepatic mRNA expression of acaca, scd1, fasn and pparg was significantly lower after siRNA treatment. Systemic inhibition of the enzymatic dpp4 activity by an oral dpp4 inhibitor significantly improved glucose handling in db/db mice but did not affect hepatic endpoints. These data demonstrate that a targeted reduction of dpp4 expression in the liver may not be sufficient to improve whole-body glucose metabolism in obese and diabetic mice but may improve hepatic lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2993865455,"Begomoviruses interfere with host plant machinery to evade host defense mechanism by interacting with plant proteins. In the old world, this group of viruses are usually associated with betasatellite that induces severe disease symptoms by encoding a protein, βC1, which is a pathogenicity determinant. Here, we show that βC1 encoded by Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMB) requires Gossypium hirsutum calmodulin-like protein 11 (Gh-CML11) to infect cotton. First, we used the in silico approach to predict the interaction of CLCuMB-βC1 with Gh-CML11. A number of sequence- and structure-based in-silico interaction prediction techniques suggested a strong putative binding of CLCuMB-βC1 with Gh-CML11 in a Ca+2-dependent manner. In-silico interaction prediction was then confirmed by three different experimental approaches: The Gh-CML11 interaction was confirmed using CLCuMB-βC1 in a yeast two hybrid system and pull down assay. These results were further validated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation system showing the interaction in cytoplasmic veins of Nicotiana benthamiana. Bioinformatics and molecular studies suggested that CLCuMB-βC1 induces the overexpression of Gh-CML11 protein and ultimately provides calcium as a nutrient source for virus movement and transmission. This is the first comprehensive study on the interaction between CLCuMB-βC1 and Gh-CML11 proteins which provided insights into our understating of the role of βC1 in cotton leaf curl disease."
https://openalex.org/W2993979856,"The rapid emergence of novel psychoactive substances within the past decade has raised new concerns about the harms associated with unregulated drug use. Synthetic analogues-chemically related to established psychoactive substances like cannabis sativa and catha edulis-in particular have proliferated rapidly, allowing little opportunity for scientific research or the establishment of informal guidelines for safe use among consumers. To explore how synthetic substance use relates to other forms of use, this paper presents an analysis of polysubstance use among a sample of 676 people who use illicit substances in the United States. Participants were sampled from three greater metropolitan areas (Houston/Galveston, Texas; New York City; and New Orleans, Louisiana). Study researchers used cluster-type analyses to develop dendrogram visualizations of the interrelationships between substance types. Results suggest a considerable variation in substance and polysubstance use patterns across states in the U.S. Polysubstance use clustered around well-observed combinations like MDMA/cannabis and cocaine/heroin. Synthetic cannabinoids and cathinones showed no strong clustering with other substances. High rates of binge drinking among users of other substances further support the importance of interventions sensitive to the clinical challenges of polysubstance use."
https://openalex.org/W2992521807,"More than 20 people die each year in snow avalanches in Switzerland. Previous studies have primarily described these victims, but were not population based. We investigated sociodemographic factors for avalanche mortality between 1995 and 2014 in the entire Swiss resident population.Within the Swiss National Cohort we ascertained avalanche deaths by anonymous data linkage with the avalanche accident database at the Swiss WSL Institute of Snow and Avalanche Research SLF. We calculated incidence rates, by dividing the number of deaths from avalanches by the number of person-years, and hazard ratios (HRs) for sociodemographic and economic characteristics using Cox proportional hazard models.The data linkage yielded 250 deaths from avalanche within the SNC population for the 20 years 1995 to 2014. The median distance between the place of residence and the place of the event (avalanche) was 61.1 km. Male gender, younger age (15-45 years), Swiss nationality, living in the Alpine regions, higher education, living in the highest socioeconomic quintile of neighbourhoods, being single, and living in a household with one or more children were associated with higher avalanche mortality rates. Furthermore, for younger persons (<40 years) the hazard of dying in an avalanche between 2005 and 2014 was significantly lower than in the years 1995 to 2004 (HR = 0.56, 95%-CI: 0.36-0.85).Over a 20-year period in Switzerland, higher rates of dying in an avalanche were observed in men, in younger age groups, and persons with tertiary education, living in the highest socioeconomic quintile of neighbourhoods, and living in an Alpine region. For younger persons (<40 years), the hazard declined during the study period."
https://openalex.org/W2993879061,"Objectives To explore possible working mechanisms of anxiety reduction in women with anxiety disorders, treated with art therapy (AT). Methods A RCT comparing AT versus waiting list (WL) condition on aspects of self-regulation. Stress regulation (heart rate and heart rate variability) and executive functioning (daily behavioural and cognitive performance aspects of executive functioning (EF)) were evaluated in a pre-post design. Participants were women, aged 18–65 years with moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Results Effectiveness of AT compared to WL was demonstrated in a higher resting HRV post treatment, improvements in aspects of self-reported daily EF (emotion control, working memory, plan/organize and task monitor), but not in cognitive performance of EF, stress responsiveness and down regulation of stress. The decrease in anxiety level was associated with improvements in self-reported daily EF. Conclusions AT improves resting HRV and aspects of EF, the latter was associated with art therapy-related anxiety reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2992542931,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) represents the most recent modality in retinal imaging for non-invasive and depth-selective visualization of blood flow in retinal vessels. With regard to quantitative OCTA measurements for early detection of subclinical alterations, it is of great interest, which intra- and extra-ocular factors affect the results of OCTA measurements. Here, we performed OCTA imaging of the central retina in 65 eyes of 65 young healthy female and male participants and evaluated individual physical fitness levels by standard lactate diagnostic using an incremental maximal performance running test. The main finding was that OCTA measurements of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were associated with physical fitness. Using multivariate regression analysis, we found that running speed at the individual lactate threshold, a marker strongly associated with aerobic performance capacity, significantly contributed to differences in FAZ area (β = 0.111, p = 0.032). The data indicates that smaller FAZ areas are likely observed in individuals with higher aerobic exercise capacity. Our findings are also of interest with respect to the potential use of retinal OCTA imaging to detect exercise-induced microvascular adaptations in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2993573157,"Introduction Adequate vaccine storage is a prerequisite to assure vaccine effectiveness and tolerability. In this context, maintaining the cold chain (2°C to 8°C) is the paramount objective. To establish quality-ensured cold chain maintenance, compliance with several structural and procedural aspects is necessary. Main objective The aim of this publication is to assess the quality of vaccine refrigerator management in general practices. Methods This study describes baseline results of an intervention study. To evaluate the quality of vaccine refrigerator management, visual inspections were conducted of refrigerators used to store vaccines in general practices of a German teaching practice network. The study instrument was a checklist with ten quality criteria based on international best practices for vaccine storage. A data logger recorded refrigerator temperatures for 7 days. We analyzed associations between reaching more than half (6+) of the ten quality criteria and temperature data. Results The study included 64 of 168 practices (38.1% response rate) with 75 refrigerators. No practice fulfilled all 10 quality criteria. On average, 4.7 (standard deviation = 1.9) criteria were met. The most frequent deficits were: no drawers/bins/baskets for vaccines (81.3%), no temperature logbook near refrigerator (75.0%), no temperature recording device in the center of the refrigerator (54.0%), vaccines boxes with contact to outer walls (46.3%), and refrigerator unsuitable for vaccine storage (44.6%). Refrigerators with better management (≥6 quality criteria) were more likely to have temperatures in the target range (62.5% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.008). Conclusion We identified a large number of avoidable vaccine storage errors. Effective strategies, e.g. web-based programs, to improve vaccine storage conditions in general practices are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2994166505,"Globally, ten percent of new HIV infections are among children and most of these children acquire infection through mother-to-child transmission. To prevent this, lifelong ART among pregnant and breast feeding (PBF) women living with HIV, irrespective of the WHO clinical stage, was adopted (option B+). There is limited cohort-wise assessment of VL testing among women on 'option B+'.Among a pregnancy cohort on antiretroviral therapy in public hospitals and clinics of Mazowe district, Zimbabwe (2017), to determine the i) proportion undergoing VL testing anytime up to six months post child birth and associated factors; ii) turnaround time (TAT) from sending the specimen to results receipt and VL suppression among those undergoing VL testing.This was a cohort study involving secondary programme data. Modified Poisson regression using robust variance estimates was used to determine the independent predictors of VL testing.Of 1112 women, 354 (31.8%, 95% CI: 29.2-34.6) underwent VL testing: 113 (31.9%) during pregnancy, 124 (35%) within six months of child birth and for 117 (33.1%), testing period was unknown. Of 354, VL suppression was seen in 334 (94.4%) and 13 out of 20 with VL non-suppression underwent repeat VL testing. Among those with available dates (125/354), the median TAT was 93 days (IQR 19.3-255). Of 1112, VL results were available between 32 weeks and child birth in 31 (2.8%) women. When compared to hospitals, women registered for antenatal care in clinics were 36% less likely to undergo VL testing [aRR: 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.76)].Among women on option B+, the uptake of HIV VL testing was low with unacceptably long TAT. VL suppression among those tested was satisfactory. There is an urgent need to prioritize VL testing among PBF women and to consider use of point of care machines. There is a critical need to strengthen the recording and local utilisation of routine clinic data in order to successfully monitor progress of healthcare services provided."
https://openalex.org/W2994147173,"With the growing popularity of online services such as online banking and online shopping, one of the essential research topics is how to build a privacy-preserving user abnormal behavior recommendation system. However, a machine-learning based system may present a dilemma. On one aspect, such system requires large volume of features to pre-train the model, but on another aspect, it is challenging to design usable features without looking to plaintext private data. In this paper, we propose an unorthodox approach involving graph analysis to resolve this dilemma and build a novel private-preserving recommendation system under a multilayer network framework. In experiments, we use a large, state-of-the-art dataset (containing more than 40,000 nodes and 43 million encrypted features) to evaluate the recommendation ability of our system on abnormal user behavior, yielding an overall precision rate of around 0.9, a recall rate of 1.0, and an F1-score of around 0.94. Also, we have also reported a linear time complexity for our system. Last, we deploy our system on the ""Wenjuanxing"" crowd-sourced system and ""Amazon Mechanical Turk"" for other users to evaluate in all aspects. The result shows that almost all feedbacks have achieved up to 85% satisfaction."

This study aimed to describe the 10 years of influenza activity in Cameroon between January 2009 and December 2018. Respiratory samples were collected from sentinel sites responsible for influenza surveillance in Cameroon and analyzed for the presence of influenza. Globally, 9 of the 10 administrative regions of the country were represented with at least 1 year of data. A total of 11816 respiratory samples were collected and influenza virus detection rate was 24.0%. The most represented age group was the 0–1 years representing more than 40% of the collected samples and possessing the lowest proportion of influenza cases (16.2%). Meanwhile higher proportions of influenza positive cases was found in the 2–4, 5–14 and 15–49 years age group at ≥29%. Among outpatients, the frequency of influenza virus was 24.8% while in hospitalized patients, 18.7% of samples were positive for influenza virus. We noted year-round circulation of influenza virus in Cameroon with 2 peaks in activity: a major peak in the months of September to December and a minor peak in the months of March to July. Antigenic characterization of influenza isolates showed 37.5% (6/16) vaccine match between the predominant Cameroon strains and the Northern hemisphere vaccine strains with majority of vaccine match observed in influenza B/Victoria subtype (4/6; 66.7%). Data collected from this surveillance system is essential to add to global information on the spread of influenza."

Our study aimed to explore whether the maternal p-BMI and GWG were associated with regulatory single-locus DNA methylation in selected obesogenic genes. For this purpose, DNA methylation was assayed by Methylation-Sensitive High Resolution Melting (MS-HRM) technique and Sanger allele-bisulfite sequencing in fifty samples of umbilical vein to evaluate glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 (GNPDA2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1α), and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes. Correlations between DNA methylation levels and indicators of maternal nutritional status were carried out. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression in extracts of the same samples. Results indicated that GNPDA2 and PGC1α genes have the same level of DNA methylation in all samples; however, a differential DNA methylation of LEPR gene promoter was found, correlating it with GWG and this correlation is unaffected by maternal age or unhealthy habits. Furthermore, leptin receptor (Lep-Rb) was upregulated in samples that showed the lowest levels of DNA methylation. This study highlights the association between poor GWG and adjustments on obesogenic genes expression in newborn tissues with potential consequences for development of obesity in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2993378959,"Currently, data regarding optimal treatment modality, response, and outcome specifically for N3 head and neck cancer are limited. This study aimed to compare the treatment outcomes between definitive chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) to the neck and upfront neck dissection followed by adjuvant CCRT. Ninety-three N3 squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cancer patients were included. Primary tumor treatment was divided to definitive CCRT (CCRT group) or curative surgery followed by adjuvant CCRT (surgery group). Neck treatment was also classified into two treatment modalities: definitive CCRT to the neck (CCRT group) or curative neck dissection followed by adjuvant CCRT (neck dissection group). Overall, the 2-year overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were 51.8%, 47.3%, 45.6%, and 43.6%, respectively. In both oropharyngeal cancer and nonoropharyngeal cancer patients, in terms of OS, LRFS, RRFS or DMFS no difference was noted regarding primary tumor treatment (CCRT vs. surgery) or neck treatment (CCRT vs. neck dissection). In summary, N3 neck patients treated with definitive CCRT may achieve similar outcomes to those treated with upfront neck dissection followed by adjuvant CCRT. Caution should be made to avoid overtreatment for this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2994075856,"Background Anemia is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality, particularly among children. Management of anemia depends on causes and severity of anemia. However blood transfusion is a lifesaving intervention in severe and life-threatening anemia. There are no published data on blood transfusion for anemia in Sudan. Methods A descriptive study was conducted in Gadarif Hospital in eastern Sudan during 1 August, 2017 to 31 March, 2018. Consecutive children who presented at the emergency room with an indication for blood transfusion were enrolled in the study. A detailed history was gathered from all patients. Physical examinations, including vital signs, were performed. The World Health Organization guidelines for blood transfusion were followed. Results During the study period, a total of 1800 children were admitted to the emergency pediatric ward in Gadarif Hospital and were assessed for anemia, 513 (28.5%) were anemic and 141 (7.8%) had severe anemia. Three hundred anemic children received blood transfusion. The median (interquartile) of the age of the 300 children who received blood transfusion was 4.2 4.2(2.0–9.0) years. A total of 148 (49.3%) of the children were boys and 151 (50.3%) were younger than 5 years. The diagnoses associated with the order for blood transfusion were sickle cell disease (129, 43.0%), active bleeding (58, 19.3%), malaria (50, 16.7%), visceral leishmaniasis (25, 8.3%), severe acute malnutrition (16, 5.30%), snake bite (11, 3.7%), sepsis (5, 1.7%), and others. Two hundred eighty-five (95.0%) children improved, nine children were discharged against medical advice, and six (2.0%) children died. Conclusion There is a high burden of anemia in eastern Sudan. Sickle cell disease, malaria, and visceral leishmaniasis are the main causes of anemia in this region. Further research on blood transfusion is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2992622083,"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most common complaint among industrial workers. The potato-chip processing industry involves workers in repetitive activities leading to MSDs. This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to assess MSDs health risk among potato-chip processing workers. It was conducted among 107 randomly sampled workers from a distribution like other groups exposed to similar ergonomics factors. A MSDs health-risk assessment produced a matrix of combined results based on a self-report questionnaire (5 levels) and an ergonomics risk assessment using RULA (4 levels). The self-reported MSDs questionnaire showed that workers had moderate to very high discomfort levels, i.e., 11.21% trunk, 9.35% lower limbs, 8.41% upper limbs and 4.66% for the neck. Ergonomic risks were found to be at a very high level, 77.57%, and high risk level, 19.63%. The combined matrix assessments showed that most workers were at moderate to very high MSDs risk, i.e., 43.92% trunk, 36.45% upper limbs, 32.71% lower limbs and 20.56% for the neck. This health risk matrix found a higher proportion of workers presenting with MSDs health risk compared with the musculoskeletal disorders self-assessment alone. Therefore, the MSDs risk matrix assessment could be useful for surveillance screening prior to implementing a risk-reduction program. Further, using ergonomics training programs and improving work stations for high-risk groups are also recommended based on the ergonomic and health risk assessments in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2994246151,"When consumers are faced with the choice of competitive chain facilities that offer exclusive services, current rules do not properly describe the behavior pattern of these consumers. To eliminate the gap between the current rules and this kind of customers behavior pattern, the partially proportional rule with a threshold is proposed in this paper. A leader-follower model for discrete competitive facility location problem is established under the partially proportional rule with a threshold. Combining with the greedy strategy and the 2-opt strategy, a heuristical algorithm (GFA) is designed to solve the follower's problem. By embedding the algorithm (GFA), an improved ranking-based algorithm (IRGA) is proposed to solve the leader-follower model. Numerical tests show that the algorithm proposed in this paper can solve the leader-follower model for discrete competitive facility location problem effectively. The effects of different parameters on the market share captured by the leader firm and the follower firm are analyzed in detail using a quasi-real example. An interesting finding is that in some cases the leader firm does not have a first-mover advantage."
https://openalex.org/W2991769818,"The primary aim of the current study was to determine the time curves of changes in the record scores in the snatch and its variations during a two-year training cycle in young weightlifters. This study also aimed at assessing the ratios between these scores and at predicting the snatch record scores at the end of the subsequent annual training macrocycle. The final purpose was to compare the record scores with the isometric peak torque values of the trunk and knee extensors. The study involved 16 weightlifters who were tested seven times at three-month intervals. The overall mean ratios of the record scores in the hang snatch to those in the snatch and the record scores in the hang power snatch to those in the snatch were approximately constant and amounted to 0.95 and 0.79, respectively. The overall mean ratio between the scores in the power snatch to those in the snatch was approximately 0.88. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the individual time trajectories of record scores in the snatch and its derivatives were identified in two consecutive annual training macrocycles. The error in predicting record results at the end of the following annual training macrocycle was 6.7 ± 4.7% or 8.1 ± 3.4% depending on the way the measurement data were modeled. The results of the study also indicate that the measurements of the isometric peak torque of the trunk extensors performed in laboratory conditions can be useful in diagnosing the strength capacity of young weightlifters."
https://openalex.org/W2993515596,"Many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are not fatal, but they are disabling, disfiguring and stigmatizing. More accurate data on these aspects would benefit planning, monitoring and evaluation of interventions, as well as provision of appropriate services for the often life-long consequences. In 2015, a cross-NTD toolkit was developed, consisting of a variety of existing questionnaires to measure morbidity, disability and health-related quality of life. The toolkit covers the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. These tools have been developed in a source country, however, it was intended for the cross-NTD toolkit to be applicable across NTDs in many countries with different cultures and languages in order to generate universally comparative data. Therefore; the present study aimed to validate several tools of the toolkit among people affected by leprosy or leishmaniasis in the cultural settings of Cartagena and Cúcuta, Colombia.This study aimed to validate the following tools among 55 participants between 18-85 years old, affected by leprosy and leishmaniasis: (I) Clinical Profile, (II) Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ), (III) WHO Quality of Life assessment-abbreviated version (WHOQOL-BREF), and (IV) WHO Quality of Life assessment-Disability (WHOQOL-DIS). The tools were administered during face-to-face interviews and were followed by open questions about the respondents' thoughts on format of the tool and the understanding, relevance and acceptability of the items. The tools were validated using a qualitative method approach based on the framework for cultural equivalence, measured by the cultural, item, semantic and operational equivalences.The Clinical Profile was seen as acceptable and relevant, only the semantic equivalence was not as satisfying and needs a few adaptations. The SRQ was very well understood and shows to reach the equivalences for the population of Colombia without any additional changes. Several items of the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-DIS were not well understood and changes are recommended due to semantic difficulties. Operational equivalence of both questionnaires was not as desired in relation to the used response scales. The participants shared that the tools are relevant and important for their particular situation.The SRQ is found to be a valid tool for Colombia and can be included in the cross-NTD toolkit. The Clinical Profile, WHOQOL-BREF & WHOQOL-DIS need changes and retesting among Colombian people affected by an NTD. The toolkit as a whole is seen as useful to show the effects leprosy and leishmaniasis have on the participants. This cultural validation will contribute to a universally applicable cross-NTD toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W2994435475,"Previous research on risk-glorifying media has provided encompassing evidence for a positive connection between risk-glorifying contents and (a) risk-positive emotions, (b) risk-positive cognitions and attitudes, and (c) risk-positive behavioral inclinations. Nevertheless, little evidence shows whether risk-glorifying content increases actual risk behavior. We conducted three experimental studies to assess whether risk-glorifying commercials increase risk behavior. In all studies, participants were randomly assigned to a risk-glorifying or a neutral commercial. Additionally, in Study 2 participants were randomly assigned to an arousal or a non-arousal condition to test the mediating effect of arousal. In Study 3, we tested the mediating effect of the accessibility to risk-positive cognitions. We measured participants' risk behavior via the risk assessment ramp (RAR). Our results revealed that participants who watched the risk-glorifying commercial walked faster to the jumping-off point (Studies 1, 2, & 3) and would have jumped from a higher level (Studies 2 & 3), thus, indicating the exposure to risk-glorifying media content increases people's risk behavior. Neither arousal nor the accessibility to risk-positive cognitions mediated the effect of risk-glorifying media content. Beyond our findings, we offer a new tool to assess risk behavior that is effective and easy to apply."
https://openalex.org/W2994522237,"MAP/microtubule-affinity regulating kinases (MARK1-4) are members of the AMPK family of Ser/Thr-specific kinases, which phosphorylate substrates at consensus LXRXXSXXXL motifs. Within microtubule-associated proteins, MARKs also mediate phosphorylation of variant KXGS or ζXKXGSXXNΨ motifs, interfering with the ability of tau and MAP2/4 to bind to microtubules. Here we show that, although MARKs and the closely related salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) phosphorylate substrates with consensus AMPK motifs comparably, MARKs are more potent in recognizing variant ζXKXGSXXNΨ motifs on cellular tau. In studies to identify regions of MARKs that confer catalytic activity towards variant sites, we found that the C-terminal kinase associated-1 (KA1) domain in MARK1-3 mediates binding to microtubule-associated proteins CLASP1/2; but this interaction is dispensable for ζXKXGSXXNΨ phosphorylation. Mutational analysis of MARK2 revealed that the N-terminal kinase domain of MARK2 is sufficient for phosphorylation of both consensus and variant ζXKXGSXXNΨ sites. Within this domain, the KLDpT activation loop motif promotes MARK2 activity both intracellularly and in vitro, but has no effect on SIK2 activity. As KLDpT is conserved in all vertebrates MARKs, we conclude that this sequence is crucial for MARK-dependent regulation of cellular polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2994217707,"The impact of invasive species on recipient communities can vary with environmental context and across levels of biological complexity. We investigated how an established invasive seaweed species affected the biomass, eco-physiology, carbon and nitrogen storage capacity of native seaweeds at sites with a different environmental setting due to a persistent upwelling in northern Spain. We removed the invasive Japanese wireweed Sargassum muticum from intertidal rock pools once every month during a one-year period and used an in-situ stable isotope pulse-chase labeling to estimate gross primary production (GPP), nitrogen uptake rate, 13C-carbon and 15N-nitrogen storage capacities. Following the addition of 13C-enriched bicarbonate and 15N-enriched nitrate to the seawater in the rock pools during the period of the low tide, we sampled macroalgal thalli at incoming tide to determine label uptake rate. After four days, we sampled macroalgal assemblages to determine both label storage capacity and biomass. After one year of removal there was no change in the macroalgal assemblage. However, both the GPP and 13C-carbon storage capacity were higher in the turf-forming Corallina spp. and, sometimes, in the canopy-forming Bifurcaria bifurcata. Nitrogen uptake rate followed similar, but more variable results. Although S. muticum inhibited carbon storage capacity of native species, the assemblage-level 13C-carbon storage was similar in the S. muticum-removed and control rock pools because the presence of the invasive species compensated for the functional loss of native species, particularly at sites where it was most abundant. No obvious effects were observed in relation to the environmental setting. Overall, the effect of the invasive S. muticum on carbon flow appeared to be mediated both by the effects on resource-use efficiency of native species and by its own biomass. Integrating physiological and assemblage-level responses can provide a broad understanding of how invasive species affect recipient communities and ecosystem functioning."

Many firms adopt a variety of strategies to shorten delivery time, and holding sufficient inventory is reported as an effective way. This study integrates a market share attraction model based on delivery time competition with the traditional inventory model to determine the optimal delivery time and order quantity. With the use of supermodular game method, we investigate the effect of changes in marketing and operations factors on the equilibrium delivery time and order quantity in non-dominated and dominated oligopolistic markets. The results reveal that the equilibrium delivery time and order quantity exhibit a directional response to changes in marketing and operations factors, and the response differs between the non-dominated oligopoly and the dominated oligopoly. Furthermore, under a cooperative oligopolistic market with asymmetry, it is beneficial for the firms with high competitive strength to adopt the delivery time strategy, but it fails to do so for the firm with the low competitive strength. Lastly, numerical analysis suggests that marketing factors play a more important role in affecting equilibrium measures than operations factors."
