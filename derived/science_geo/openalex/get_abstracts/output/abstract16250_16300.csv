https://openalex.org/W1565459224,"The rapid inactivation of aconitase by O2-, previously seen to occur in vitro, was explored in vivo. A fraction of the aconitase in growing, aerobic, Escherichia coli is inactive at any instant but can be activated by imposition of anaerobic conditions. This reactivation occurred in the absence of protein synthesis and was inhibited by the ferrous chelator alpha,alpha‘-dipyridyl. This fraction of inactive, but activatable, aconitase was increased by augmenting O2- production with paraquat, decreased by elevation of superoxide dismutase, and increased by inhibiting reactivation with alpha,alpha‘-dipyridyl. The balance between inactive and active aconitase thus represented a pseudoequilibrium between inactivation by O2- and reactivation by restoration of Fe(II), and it provided, for the first time, a measure of the steady-state concentration of O2- within E. coli. On this basis, [O2-] was estimated to be approximately 20-40 pM in aerobic log phase E. coli containing wild type levels of superoxide dismutase and approximately 300 pM in a mutant strain lacking superoxide dismutase."

https://openalex.org/W1485321383,"Using the electron spin resonance/spin trapping system, 4-pyridyl 1-oxide N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN)/ethanol, hydroxyl radical was detected as the alpha-hydroxyethyl spin trapped adduct of 4-POBN, 4-POBN-CH(CH3)OH, from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated human neutrophils and monocytes without the addition of supplemental iron. 4-POBN-CH(CH3)OH was stable in the presence of a neutrophil-derived superoxide flux. Hydroxyl radical formation was inhibited by treatment with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and azide. Treatment with a series of transition metal chelators did not appreciably alter 4-POBN-CH(CH3)OH, which suggested that hydroxyl radical generation was mediated by a mechanism independent of the transition metal-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. Kinetic differences between transition metal-dependent and -independent mechanisms of hydroxyl radical generation by stimulated neutrophils were demonstrated by a greater rate of 4-POBN-CH(CH3)-OH accumulation in the presence of supplemental iron. Detection of hydroxyl radical from stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages, which lack myeloperoxidase, required the addition of supplemental iron. The addition of purified myeloperoxidase to an enzymatic superoxide generating system resulted in the detection of hydroxyl radical that was dependent upon the presence of chloride and was inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and azide. These findings implicated the reaction of hypochlorous acid and superoxide to produce hydroxyl radical. 4-POBN-CH(CH3)OH was not observed upon stimulation of myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils, whereas addition of myeloperoxidase to the reaction mixture resulted in the detection of hydroxyl radical. These results support the ability of human neutrophils and monocytes to generate hydroxyl radical through a myeloperoxidase-dependent mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2130572726,"The 14-residue region Arg2410-Lys2423 of the human insulin-like growth factor II receptor possesses the ability to stimulate Gi, the activity being dependent on two structural characteristics: (i) at least two basic residues at the N-terminal side and (ii) the C-terminal motif, B-B-X-B or B-B-X-X-B (where B is a basic residue and X is a non-basic residue). The regions satisfying (i) and (ii) with 10 less than or equal to residue length less than or equal to 26 were located in all of the third inner loops and some of the other intracellular domains of the Gi-coupled M4 sub-type muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M4AChR) and the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AR). Both the second inner loop 130-147 and the C-terminal portion of the third inner loop 382-400 (MIII) of human M4AChR had the ability to stimulate G proteins with the order Gi approximately Go greater than Gs, but only MIII could activate Gi/Go at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, the N-terminal portion of the third inner loop 218-228 of human alpha 2AR-C10 activated Gi, Go, and Gs at micromolar concentrations with equal potency, whereas the further C-terminal portion of the third inner loop 301-313 of this receptor lacked the ability to activate any G protein. Among these active regions, only MIII indicated Mg(2+)-dependent Gi-stimulating function. Therefore, the search for the regions satisfying (i) and (ii) was useful to localize the G protein-activating activity of Gi-coupled receptors in limited regions, which were not always in the C-terminal portions of the third intracellular loops and activated G proteins in various modes of actions."
https://openalex.org/W1622499917,"The glial-derived protein S100 beta can act as a mitogen or a neurotrophic factor, stimulating proliferation of glial cells or differentiation of immature neurons. We report here that dimeric S100 beta evokes increases in intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in both glial cells and neuronal cells. The [Ca2+]i increase exhibited a rapid transient component which was not affected by removal of extracellular calcium and a sustained component which appeared to require influx of extracellular calcium through Ni(2+)-sensitive channels. S100 beta also stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides, suggesting a mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores. These data suggest that although the final biological responses of neuronal and glial cells to S100 beta are different, transduction of the S100 beta signal in both cell types involves changes in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1550055752,"The role of the urokinase receptor (uPAR) in the internalization of the urokinase-plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (uPA.PAI-1) complex has been investigated. First, exploiting the species specificity of uPA binding, we show that mouse LB6 cells (that express a mouse uPAR) were unable to bind or degrade the human uPA.PAI-1 complex. On the other hand, LB6 clone 19 cells, which express a transfected human uPAR, degraded uPA.PAI-1 complexes with kinetics identical to the human monocytic U937 cells. We also show by immunofluorescence experiments with anti-uPA antibodies that in LB6 clone 19 cells, the uPA.PAI-1 complex is indeed internalized. While at 4 degrees C uPA fluorescence was visible at the cell surface, shift of the temperature to 37 degrees C caused a displacement of the immunoreactivity to the cytoplasmic compartment, with a pattern indicating lysosomal localization. If uPA.PAI-1 internalization/degradation is mediated by uPAR, inhibition of uPA.PAI-1 binding to uPAR should block degradation. Three different treatments, competition with the agonist amino-terminal fragment of uPA, treatment with a monoclonal antibody directed toward the binding domain of uPAR or release of uPAR from the cell surface with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C completely prevented uPA.PAI-1 degradation. The possibility that a serpin-enzyme complex receptor might be primarily or secondarily involved in the internalization process was excluded since a serpin-enzyme complex peptide failed to inhibit uPA.PAI-1 binding and degradation. Similarly, complexes of PAI-1 with low molecular mass uPA (33 kDa uPA), which lacks the uPAR binding domain, were neither bound nor degraded. Finally we also show that treatment of cells with uPA.PAI-1 complex caused a specific but partial down-regulation of uPAR. A similar result was obtained when PAI-1 was allowed to complex to uPA that had been previously bound to the receptor. The possibility therefore exists that the entire complex uPA.PAI-1-uPAR is internalized. All these data allow us to conclude that internalization of the uPA.PAI-1 complex is mediated by uPAR."
https://openalex.org/W1557403719,"The role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor autophosphorylation sites in the regulation of receptor functions has been studied using cells transfected with mutant EGF receptors. Simultaneous point mutation of 4 tyrosines (Y1068, Y1086, Y1148, Y1173) to phenylalanine, as well as removal of these sites by truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 123 amino acid residues, resulted in reduced receptor phosphorylation of an in vivo specific substrate phospholipase C-gamma 1 to less than 50% compared to the wild-type receptor. The internalization rate constant Ke was also significantly lower in these mutants (0.15/min) compared to cells transfected with wild-type receptor (0.27/min). Additional mutation of tyrosine 992 to phenylalanine in the truncated receptor mutant (Dc-123F) further decreased the receptor internalization rate to a minimal level (ke = 0.07-0.10/min), equivalent to the ke measured for cells expressing kinase-negative receptor (A721). Moreover, tyrosine kinase activity of the Dc-123F receptor toward phospholipase C-gamma 1, compared to wild-type receptor, was reduced by 90%. Taken together, these results show that EGF receptor lacking five autophosphorylation sites functions similar to a kinase-negative receptor. Mutation of tyrosine residue Y992 alone in the context of full length EGF receptor, however, did not affect receptor internalization or kinase activity toward phospholipase C-gamma 1. These data indicate that tyrosine 992 is critical for substrate phosphorylation and internalization only in the context of the truncated receptor, and that minor autophosphorylation sites, such as Y992, may act as compensatory regulatory sties in the absence of the major EGF receptor autophosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W2075700473,"The molecular basis of skeletal muscle lineage determination was investigated by analyzing DNA control elements that regulate the myogenic determination gene myoD. A distal enhancer was identified that positively regulates expression of the human myoD gene. The myoD enhancer and promoter were active in myogenic and several nonmyogenic cell lines. In transgenic mouse embryos, however, the myoD enhancer and promoter together directed expression of a lacZ transgene specifically to the skeletal muscle lineage. These data suggest that during development myoD is regulated by mechanisms that restrict accessibility of myoD control elements to positive trans-acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1567823021,"Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is an autocrine growth and motility factor for human rhabdomyosarcoma. It interacts with three different receptors: the IGF-I, the IGF-II, and the insulin receptor. A specific function of the IGF-II receptor in mediating IGF-II responses has not been defined. In this report we investigate the mechanism of IGF-II-mediated motility in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We demonstrate that IGF-II and [Leu27]IGF-II, an analog selective for the IGF-II receptor, stimulate motility at concentrations in which they interact only with their own receptor. An antibody that blocks the IGF-I receptor does not inhibit either peptide activity, while an antibody specific for the IGF-II receptor suppresses the IGF-II-induced motility. This antibody does not interfere with rhabdomyosarcoma cell proliferation. We conclude that in rhabdomyosarcoma cells IGF-II stimulates two different responses mediated by distinct receptors: 1) a mitogenic response through the type I receptor and 2) a motility response through the type II receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1491971943,"A sperm whale myoglobin gene containing multiple unique restriction sites has been constructed in pUC 18 by sequential assembly of chemically synthesized oligonucleotide fragments. Expression of the gene in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha cells yields protein that is identical to native sperm whale myoglobin except that it retains the terminal methionine. Site-specific mutagenesis has been used to prepare all the possible tyrosine----phenylalanine mutants of the recombinant myoglobin, including the three single mutants at Tyr-103, -146, and -151, the three double mutants, and the triple mutant. All of the mutant proteins are stable except the Tyr-103 mutant. Introduction of a second mutation (Lys-102----Gln) stabilizes the Tyr-103 mutant. Absorption spectroscopy suggests that the active sites of the mutant proteins are intact. EPR and absorption spectroscopy show that all the proteins, including the triple mutant devoid of tyrosine residues, react with H2O2 to give a ferryl species and a protein radical. The presence of a protein radical in all the mutants suggests that the radical center is readily transferred from one amino acid to another. Cross-linking studies show, however, that protein dimers are only formed when Tyr-151 is present. Tyr-103, shown earlier to be the residue that primarily cross-links to Tyr-151 (Tew, D., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17880-17886), is not essential for cross-linking. Electron transfer from Tyr-151 to the heme, which are 12 A apart, occurs in the absence of the intervening tyrosines at positions 103 and 146. The present studies show that the peroxide-generated myoglobin radical readily exchanges between remote loci, including non-tyrosine residues, but protein cross-linking only occurs when radical density is located on Tyr-151."
https://openalex.org/W1568276439,"The Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein that is expressed and active in both Escherichia coli and P. oleovorans. Its primary sequence contains eight hydrophobic stretches that could span the membrane as alpha-helices. The topology of alkane hydroxylase was studied in E. coli using protein fusions linking different amino-terminal fragments of the alkane hydroxylase (AlkB) to alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and to beta-galactosidase (LacZ). Four AlkB-PhoA fusions were constructed using transposon TnphoA. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create PstI sites at 12 positions in AlkB. These sites were used to create AlkB-PhoA and AlkB-LacZ fusions. With respect to alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase activity each set of AlkB-PhoA and AlkB-LacZ fusions revealed the expected complementary activities. At three positions, PhoA fusions were highly active, whereas the corresponding LacZ fusions were the least active. At all other positions the PhoA fusions were almost completely inactive, but the corresponding LacZ fusions were highly active. These data predict a model for alkane hydroxylase containing six transmembrane segments. In this model the amino terminus, two hydrophilic loops, and a large carboxyl-terminal domain are located in the cytoplasm. Only three very short loops near amino acid positions 52, 112, and 251 are exposed to the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1582773961,"Abstract Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and cAMP stimulate hexose transport in quiescent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by stabilizing the relatively labile mRNA coding for the basal glucose transporter, GLUT-1. The 3'-UTR of GLUT-1 mRNA contains a single copy of the destabilizing AUUUA motif in the context of an AU-rich region. The adenosine-uridine binding factor (AUBF) is a cytosolic protein which interacts with similar AU-rich regions in a variety of labile cytokine and oncogene mRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that AUBF complexes in vitro with GLUT-1 mRNA through the AU-rich portion of the 3'-UTR. AUBF activity is very low in quiescent preadipocytes, but can be up-regulated by agonists such as TPA, TNF alpha, cAMP, and okadaic acid, all of which stabilize GLUT-1 mRNA. The time courses of TNF alpha- and TPA-mediated AUBF up-regulation and GLUT-1 mRNA stabilization are coincident, suggesting a cause and effect relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2168594682,"The overall goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which nucleosides are transported in choroid plexus. Choroid plexus tissue slices obtained from rabbit brain were depleted of ATP with 2,4-dinitrophenol. Uridine and thymidine accumulated in the slices against a concentration gradient in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient. The Na(+)-driven uptake of uridine and thymidine was saturable with Km values of 18.1 +/- 2.0 and 13.0 +/- 2.3 microM and Vmax values of 5.5 +/- 0.3 and 1.0 +/- 0.2 nmol/g/s, respectively. Na(+)-driven uridine uptake was inhibited by naturally occurring ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides (adenosine, cytidine, and thymidine) but not by synthetic nucleoside analogs (dideoxyadenosine, dideoxycytidine, cytidine arabinoside, and 3'-azidothymidine). Both purine (guanosine, inosine, formycin B) and pyrimidine nucleosides (uridine and cytidine) were potent inhibitors of Na(+)-thymidine transport with IC50 values ranging between 5 and 23 microM. Formycin B competitively inhibited Na(+)-thymidine uptake and thymidine trans-stimulated formycin B uptake. These data suggest that both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides are substrates of the same system. The stoichiometric coupling ratios between Na+ and the nucleosides, guanosine, uridine, and thymidine, were 1.87 +/- 0.10, 1.99 +/- 0.35, and 2.07 +/- 0.09, respectively. The system differs from Na(+)-nucleoside co-transport systems in other tissues which are generally selective for either purine or pyrimidine nucleosides and which have stoichiometric ratios of 1. This study represents the first direct demonstration of a unique Na(+)-nucleoside co-transport system in choroid plexus."
https://openalex.org/W1567631924,"The highly purified yeast mRNA capping enzyme is composed of two separate chains of 52 (alpha) and 80 kDa (beta), responsible for the activities of mRNA guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase, respectively (Itoh, N., Yamada, H., Kaziro, Y., and Mizumoto, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1989-1995). The gene encoding the mRNA guanylyltransferase subunit (alpha subunit), CEG1, has been isolated by immunological screening of a yeast genomic expression library in lambda gt11 with polyclonal antibodies directed against purified yeast capping enzyme. The identity of CEG1 was confirmed by epitope selection and by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli to give a catalytically active mRNA guanylyltransferase. The gene is present in one copy per haploid genome, and encodes a polypeptide of 459 amino acid residues. From its primary structure as well as its mRNA size, it was concluded that the alpha and the beta subunits of yeast mRNA capping enzyme are encoded by two separate genes, not as a fused protein. CEG1 is located on the chromosome VII by a pulse-field gel electrophoresis. Gene disruption experiment indicated that CEG1 is essential for the growth of yeast. We have also found another open reading frame (ORF2) which lies in close proximity to CEG1 in our clones and encodes a 450 amino acid-polypeptide of yet unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W1580710382,"Protein C inhibitor is a plasma protein whose ability to inhibit activated protein C, thrombin, and other enzymes is stimulated by heparin. These studies were undertaken to further understand how heparin binds to protein C inhibitor and how it accelerates proteinase inhibition. The region of protein C inhibitor from residues 264-283 was identified as the heparin-binding site. This differs from the putative heparin-binding site in the related proteins antithrombin and heparin cofactor. The glycosaminoglycan specificity of protein C inhibitor was relatively broad, including heparin and heparan sulfate, but not dermatan sulfate. Non-sulfated and non-carboxylated polyanions also enhanced proteinase inhibition by protein C inhibitor. Heparin accelerated inhibition of alpha-thrombin, gamma T-thrombin, activated protein C, factor Xa, urokinase, and chymotrypsin, but not plasma kallikrein. The ability of glycosaminoglycans to accelerate proteinase inhibition appeared to depend on the formation of a ternary complex of inhibitor, proteinase, and glycosaminoglycan. The optimum heparin concentration for maximal rate stimulation varied from 10 to 100 micrograms/ml and was related to the apparent affinity of the proteinase for heparin. There was no obvious relationship between heparin affinity and maximum inhibition rate or degree of rate enhancement. The affinity of the resultant protein C inhibitor-proteinase complex was also not related to inhibition rate enhancement, and the results showed that decreased heparin affinity of the complex is not an important part of the catalytic mechanism of heparin. The importance of protein C inhibitor as a regulator of the protein C system may depend on the relatively large increase in heparin-enhanced inhibition rate for activated protein C compared to other proteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1508389393,"Glycosyl phosphoinositol (GPI) anchors on proteins can be modified by palmitoylation of their inositol residue, which makes such anchors resistant to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Roberts, W. L., Myher, J. J., Kuksis, A., Low, M. G., and Rosenberry, T.L. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18766-18775). Mannosylated GPI lipids made in trypanosomal and mammalian cells can also be inositol-acylated, indicating that inositol acylation may be a normal step in GPI anchor synthesis. We find that Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants blocked in dolichyl phosphate mannose synthesis accumulate a lipid that can be radiolabeled in vivo with [3H]myo-inositol, [3H]GlcN, and [3H]palmitic acid. This lipid is resistant to PI-PLC, yet sensitive to mild alkaline hydrolysis, and has been characterized as GlcN-phosphatidylinositol (PI), fatty acylated on its inositol residue. When yeast membranes are incubated with UDP-[14C] GlcNAc, 14C-labeled GlcNAc-PI and GlcN-PI are made. Addition of ATP and CoA, or of palmitoyl-CoA to incubations results in the synthesis of [14C]GlcN-(acyl-inositol)PI. This lipid is also made when membranes are incubated with [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA and UDP-GlcNAc. We propose that acyl CoA is the donor in inositol acylation of GlcN-PI, and that GlcN-(acyl-inositol)PI is an obligatory intermediate in GPI synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1548891392,"The 4-azasteroid 17 beta-(N-t-butyl)carbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androst-1-en-3-one (finasteride) is 100-fold more potent as a competitive inhibitor of the rat NADPH:delta 4-3-oxosteroid-5-alpha- oxidoreductase (steroid 5 alpha-reductase) type 1 enzyme (Ki = 3-5 nM) than of the human type 1 enzyme (Ki greater than or equal to 300 nM). In this study, we exploit this differential sensitivity to map a major determinant of finasteride sensitivity in steroid 5 alpha-reductase. Chimeric steroid 5 alpha-reductase cDNAs composed of different combinations of rat and human exon sequences were created by genetic engineering, expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and assayed for their sensitivity to finasteride. Hybrid proteins containing sequences encoded by rat exon 1 were found to be as sensitive to finasteride as the parental enzyme. The exchange of progressively smaller protein segments encoded within exon 1 identified a tetrapeptide sequence (Val-Ser-Ile-Val) in the rat enzyme that conferred sensitivity to finasteride. The analogous sequence in the human enzyme (Ala-Val-Phe-Ala) conferred partial resistance to the drug. Finasteride was a competitive inhibitor of the native and all chimeric enzymes tested, suggesting that the tetrapeptide segments form a portion of the substrate-binding domain of steroid 5 alpha-reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1540566915,"Ubiquitin (Ub) exists in a dynamic equilibrium between the free form and the conjugated form. This equilibrium is maintained and regulated through the antagonistic actions of the conjugation system and a class of enzymes referred to collectively as the Ub-protein hydrolases. Using a previously described epitope-tagged Ub approach (Ellison, M., and Hochstrasser, M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21150-21157) we show here that a single amino acid substitution at the carboxyl terminus of Ub (Gly-76 to Ala-76) results in a derivative of Ub (UbA-76) that becomes irreversibly conjugated to protein when expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, producing a profound effect on the Ub-conjugate equilibrium. The major target of UbA-76 conjugation is itself (and presumably wild-type Ub) producing unanchored chains at the expense of the free form. Unsurprisingly, the expression of UbA-76 results in yeast phenotypes that would be expected in situations of Ub deprivation. Such cells show slow growth characteristics and sensitivity to various forms of environmental stress and to ultraviolet light. In view of these findings, the expression of UbA-76 in higher organisms may represent a convenient epigenetic strategy for examining the physiological consequences of Ub deprivation or Ub-protein hydrolase disfunction in living cells without the need for gene disruption or replacement. The observation that UbA-76 couples to itself irreversibly also provides an effective tool for elucidating the role of Ub as the proteolytic signal."
https://openalex.org/W1559291368,"Vaccinia virus DNA topoisomerase I forms a 3'-phosphoryl intermediate with duplex DNAs containing the conserved binding/cleavage motif 5'CCCTT decreases. Covalently bound enzyme is capable of transferring the incised DNA strand to a heterologous DNA acceptor containing a 5'OH terminus. Both intramolecular and intermolecular religation reactions are catalyzed. Intramolecular strand transfer occurs to the noncleaved strand of the DNA duplex and results in formation of a hairpin loop. Intermolecular religation to an exogenous DNA strand is favored over hairpin formation and requires the potential for base pairing between the acceptor and the noncleaved strand of the donor complex. As few as 4 potential base pairs are sufficient to support intermolecular transfer. These results in vitro are consistent with the proposal that vaccinia topoisomerase can catalyze sequence-specific strand transfer during genetic recombination in vivo (Shuman, S. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 10104-10108.)."
https://openalex.org/W2005408529,"A cleavage reagent directed to the active site of the Tetrahymena catalytic RNA was synthesized by derivatization of the guanosine substrate with a metal chelator. When complexed with iron(II), this reagent cleaved the RNA in five regions. Cleavage at adenosine 207, which is far from the guanosine-binding site in the primary and secondary structure, provides a constraint for the higher order folding of the RNA. This cleavage site constitutes physical evidence for a key feature of the Michel-Westhof model. Targeting a reactive entity to a specific site should be generally useful for determining proximity within folded RNA molecules or ribonucleoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1570480791,"Bovine lung cGMP-binding cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (cG-BPDE) is a potent and relatively specific substrate for cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) as compared to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) (Thomas, M. K., Francis, S. H., and Corbin, J. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14971-14978). A synthetic peptide, RKISASEFDRPLR (BPDEtide), was synthesized corresponding to the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site in cG-BPDE. BPDEtide retained the cGK/cAK kinase specificity demonstrated by native cG-BPDE: the apparent Km of BPDEtide for cGK was 5-fold lower than that for cAK (Km = 68 and 320 microM, respectively). Vmax values were 11 mumol/min/mg for cGK and 3.2 mumol/min/mg for cAK. The peptide was not phosphorylated to a measurable extent by protein kinase C or by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Thus, the primary amino acid sequence of the peptide substrate was sufficient to confer kinase specificity. Studies in crude tissue extracts indicated that BPDEtide was the most selective peptide substrate documented for measuring cGK activity. Peptide analogs of BPDEtide were synthesized to determine the contribution of specific residues to cGK or cAK substrate specificity. Substitution of a Lys for the amino-terminal Arg did not reduce cGK/cAK specificity; neither did the exchange of an Ala for the non-phosphorylated Ser nor the removal of the 3 carboxyl-terminal residues. A truncated BPDEtide (RKISASE) served equally well as substrate (Km approximately 90 microM) for both kinases. However, restoration of the Phe, to yield RKISASEF, reproduced the original cGK/cAK specificity for BPDEtide (Km = 120 and 480 microM, respectively), primarily by decreasing the affinity of cAK. Addition of a carboxyl-terminal Phe to the peptide RKRSRAE (derived from the sequence of the cGK phosphorylation site in histone H2B) or to the peptide LRRASLG (derived from the sequence of the cAK phosphorylation site in pyruvate kinase) also improved the cGK/cAK specificity by decreasing the affinity of cAK. These data suggested that the Phe in each substrate tested is a negative determinant for cAK."
https://openalex.org/W1491385457,"Endothelins (ET) are potent vasoconstrictor peptides that also function as mitogens for numerous cell types. Although regulation of second messenger pathways by ET peptides has been extensively investigated, little is known about the pathways of nuclear signaling by which ET controls gene expression. The present experiments investigated whether fos and jun contribute to nuclear signaling and gene regulation by ET isopeptides. ET isopeptides induced a subset of fos and jun mRNAs in mesangial cells, including c-fos, fra-1, c-jun, and JunB. fos and jun mRNAs were induced as members of the immediate-early gene response. Activation of the high affinity ET receptor moderately increased c-fos and fra-1 mRNA, whereas activation of the low affinity receptor markedly induced both fos and jun mRNAs. Thus, different ET receptor subtypes evoke distinct patterns of fos and jun induction. Prominent isopeptide- and cell-specific differences in the magnitude and kinetics of fos and jun expression were observed. Most striking was the marked elevation of c-fos steady-state mRNA and protein by ET-1, as compared with ET-3. In addition, ET-1, but not ET-3, increased transcriptional activity conferred by an AP-1 cis-element and directed collagenase gene expression. These results suggest that differential regulation of fos and jun expression and of AP-1 cis-element activity by ET isopeptides contributes to regulation of gene expression by ET. Furthermore, a role for AP-1 in mitogenic signaling by ET is suggested by the close correlation between AP-1 cis-element activity and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1491866615,"We have isolated high affinity inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate (IP4)- and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6)-binding proteins from detergent-solubilized rat brain membranes using a P1-tethered IP4 derivative linked to an Affi-Gel support. To determine the identity, binding characteristics, and distribution of the individual IP4 recognition sites, we have synthesized an IP4 photoaffinity label probe, 125I-(D,L)-1-O-[N-(4-azidosalicyloxy)-3-aminopropyl-1-phospho]- IP4 (125I-ASA-IP4). Two apparently distinct IP4-binding proteins (IP4BP), isolated with the IP4 affinity column, display high affinity and selectivity for IP4 over inositol trisphosphate (IP3), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5), and IP6. The first IP4-binding protein (IP4BP1) which has a KD for IP4 of 4 nM, is comprised of a protein at 182 kDa which is specifically photolabeled with high affinity by 125I-ASA-IP4. The second, IP4BP2, has an affinity for IP4 of 1.5 nM and contains proteins at 84 and 174 kDa, both of which are specifically photoaffinity labeled. A putative IP6-binding protein (IP6BP), also isolated with the IP4 affinity column, binds IP6 with a KD of 14 nM and comprises three proteins of 115, 105, and 50 kDa. The 115- and 105-kDa subunits, but not the 50-kDa subunit, specifically incorporate the photolabel. The IP4BP (182, 174, and 84 kDa) and IP6BP (115 and 105 kDa) proteins are specifically photolabeled in the crude membrane, partially purified, and purified fractions.

https://openalex.org/W1536091221,"We investigated the specificity of CAAX box-related isoprenylation of rod photoreceptor cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) subunits expressed in bacteria and the consequences of this modification on rod disk membrane association. Full-length cDNA sequences of the alpha and beta subunits of mouse PDE, inserted into bacterial pET expression vectors, were overexpressed as fusion proteins containing 28 (bMP-alpha) and 26 (bMP-beta) additional amino acid residues at their N termini. Both fusion proteins were overexpressed and stored in inclusion bodies. Purified bMP-alpha and bMP-beta were recognized by bovine PDE-specific polyclonal antibodies, but did not associate with depleted rod disk membranes and were catalytically inactive. Using bovine brain or retina extracts as sources of protein prenyltransferases and tritiated farnesyl- or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate as donors, bMP-alpha (CAAX sequence CCIQ) was exclusively farnesylated, and bMP-beta (CAAX sequence CCIL) was exclusively geranylgeranylated. After isoprenylation, bMP-alpha and bMP-beta each associated with rod photoreceptor outer segment disk membranes under isotonic, but not under hypotonic, conditions. The results indicate that isoprenylated bMP-alpha and bMP-beta each interact independently with membranes and that isoprenylation is the key modification that facilitates membrane association."
https://openalex.org/W1606461880,"Prevention of nucleoside loss in bile is physiologically desirable because hepatocytes are the main source of nucleosides for animal cells which lack de novo nucleoside biosynthesis. We have demonstrated a Na+ gradient-energized, concentrative nucleoside transport system in canalicular membrane vesicles (CMV) from rat liver by studying [3H]adenosine uptake using a rapid filtration technique. The Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transporter accepts purine, analogues of purine nucleosides and uridine; exhibits high affinity for adenosine (apparent Km, 14 microM); is not inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine or dipyridamole, and is present in CMV but not in rat liver sinusoidal membrane vesicles. Adenosine transport in right side-out CMV was substantially greater than with inside-out CMV. CMV also contain abundant ecto-ATPase and ecto-AMPase (5'-nucleotidase). These ectoenzymes were shown to degrade nucleotides into nucleosides which were conserved by the Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1531817095,"Recombinant cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and a W51A mutant of CcP, in contrast to other classical peroxidases, react with phenylhydrazine to give sigma-bonded phenyl-iron complexes. The conclusion that the heme iron is accessible to substrates is supported by the observation that CcP and W51A CcP oxidize thioanisole to the racemic sulfoxide with quantitative incorporation of oxygen from H2O2. Definitive evidence for an open active site is provided by stereoselective epoxidation by both enzymes of styrene, cis-beta-methylstyrene, and trans-beta-methylstyrene. trans-beta-methylstyrene yields exclusively the trans-epoxide, but styrene yields the epoxide and phenylacetaldehyde, and cis-beta-methylstyrene yields both the cis- and trans-epoxides and 1-phenyl-2-propanone. The sulfoxide, stereoretentive epoxides, and 1-phenyl-2-propanone are formed by ferryl oxygen transfer mechanisms because their oxygen atom derives from H2O2. In contrast, the oxygen in the trans-epoxide from the cis-olefin derives primarily from molecular oxygen and is probably introduced by a protein cooxidation mechanism. cis-[1,2-2H]-1-Phenyl-1-propene is oxidized to [1,1-2H]-1-phenyl-2-propanone without a detectable isotope effect on the epoxide:ketone product ratio. The phenyl-iron complex is not formed and substrate oxidation is not observed when the prosthetic group is replaced by delta-meso-ethylheme. CcP thus has a sufficiently open active site to form a phenyl-iron complex, to oxidize thioanisole to the sulfoxide, and to epoxidize styrene and beta-methylstyrene. The results indicate that a ferryl (Fe(IV) = O)/protein radical pair can be coupled to achieve two-electron oxidations. The unique ability of CcP to catalyze monooxygenation reactions does not conflict with its peroxidase function because cytochrome c is oxidized at a distinct surface site (DePillis, G. D., Sishta, B. P., Mauk, A. G., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19334-19341)."
https://openalex.org/W2123658786,"The intracellular domain of the insulin receptor possesses activity as a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. The receptor tyrosine kinase is stimulated by insulin binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Previously, we have identified a patient with a genetic form of insulin resistance who is heterozygous for a mutation substituting Ile for Met1153 in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor near the cluster of the three major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr1158, Tyr1162, and Tyr1163). In this investigation, the Ile1153 mutant receptor was expressed by transfection of mutant cDNA into NIH-3T3 cells. The mutation impairs receptor tyrosine kinase activity and also inhibits the ability of insulin to stimulate 2-deoxyglucose uptake and thymidine incorporation. These data support the hypothesis that the receptor tyrosine activity plays a necessary role in the ability of the receptor to mediate insulin action in vivo. Furthermore, expression of the Ile1153 mutant receptor exerted a dominant negative effect to inhibit the ability of endogenous murine receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I to mediate their actions upon the cell. This observation is consistent with previous suggestions that mutant receptors dimerize with wild type receptors, thereby creating hybrid molecules which lack biological activity. The dominant negative effect of the mutant receptor may explain the dominant mode of inheritance of insulin resistance caused by the Ile1153 mutation. Finally, the mutation inhibits the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor endocytosis. This may explain the normal number of insulin receptors on the surface of the patient's cells in vivo. Despite the presence of markedly elevated levels of insulin in the patient's plasma, the receptors were resistant to down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1582811556,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a prime candidate for mediating the inflammatory tissue damage of neutrophils because it converts Cl- to the potent oxidant hypochlorous acid. It also oxidizes xenobiotics to reactive free radicals. We have found that the kinetics of oxidation of hydroquinone by myeloperoxidase are inadequately explained by the classical peroxidase mechanism. Peroxidation of hydroquinone displayed a distinct lag phase, which was practically abolished by excluding O2 and was eliminated by adding benzoquinone at the start of the reaction. Superoxide dismutase increased the rate of peroxidation by 40% but did not eliminate the lag phase. Spectral investigations revealed that during the initial phase of the reaction, MPO was converted to oxy-MPO, or compound III, by a mechanism that was not reliant on superoxide. Benzosemiquinone, however, was able to convert ferric-MPO to compound III. Both compound III and ferro-MPO reacted with benzoquinone to regenerate ferric-MPO. We propose that the lag phase occurs because benzosemiquinone reduces ferric-MPO to ferro-MPO, which rapidly binds O2 to form compound III. Since compound III is outside the peroxidation cycle, conversion of hydroquinone to benzoquinone is retarded. However, as benzoquinone accumulates, it oxidizes ferro-MPO and compound III to ferric-MPO, thereby increasing the rate of peroxidation. There is a minimal lag phase under an atmosphere of N2 because ferro-MPO would be rapidly oxidized by benzoquinone, without formation of compound III. We conclude that when substrates produce radicals capable of reducing ferric-MPO, they will be peroxidized efficiently only if oxy-MPO is readily recycled. Furthermore, these radicals will prevent MP3+ from reacting with H2O2, and thereby prevent the enzyme from oxidizing Cl- to hypochlorous acid. Thus, this mechanism could be exploited to prevent hypochlorous acid-mediated inflammatory tissue damage."

Nicotinamide arabinoside adenine dinucleotide (ara-NAD+) and nicotinamide 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroarabinoside adenine dinucleotide (araF-NAD+) are not hydrolyzed at measurable rates and are the first documented examples of reversible slow binding inhibitors of this class of enzyme. The kinetic data obtained are consistent with both slow kon and koff rate constants in the formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex, i.e. the association rate constants are about 10(4) and 10(6) slower than diffusion rates, respectively, for araF-NAD+ and ara-NAD+, and the half-life of the complex is about 3-10 min for both analogues. The kinetic model does not account for a slow turnover of an ADP-ribosyl-enzyme intermediary complex. AraF-NAD+ is one of the most potent inhibitors described for NAD+ glycohydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1601124894,"Interactions of azide ion with bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) at five redox levels (IV) to (0), obtained by zero to four electron reduction of fully oxidized enzyme CcO(IV), were monitored by infrared and visible/Soret spectra. Partially reduced CcO gave three azide asymmetric stretch band at 2040, 2016, and 2004 cm-1 for CcO(III)N3 and two at 2040 and 2016 cm-1 for CcO(II)N3 and CcO(I)N3. Resting CcO(IV) reacts with N3- to give one band at 2041 cm-1 assigned to CuB2+N3 and another at 2051 cm-1 to N3- that is associated with protein but is not bound to a metal ion. At high azide concentrations the weak association of many azide molecules with non-metal protein sites was observed at all redox levels. These findings provide direct evidence for 1) N3- binding to CuB as well as Fea3 in partially reduced enzyme, but no binding to Fea3 in fully oxidized enzyme and no binding to either metal in fully reduced enzyme; 2) a long range effect of the oxidation state of Fea or CuA on ligand binding at heme a3, but not at CuB; and 3) an insensitivity of either Fea3 or CuB ligand site to changes in ligand or oxidation state at the other site. The observed independence of the Fea3 and CuB sites provides further support for Fea3(3)+ OOH, rather than Fea3(3)+ OOCuB2+, as an intermediate in the reduction of O2 to water by the oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1607622800,"Human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is cleared rapidly from the circulation by hepatic receptors, one of which recognizes a site in the epidermal growth factor-like domain of the molecule. To define this site more precisely, we have used oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis to introduce amino acid substitutions at specific positions located in turns that connect antiparallel beta-sheets in the epidermal growth factor-like domain. Mutated t-PA proteins with amino acid substitutions of the tyrosine residue at position 67 showed markedly lower rates of endocytosis and degradation by cultured cells of the rat hepatoma (H4) line that express a specific receptor for t-PA, and their half-life in the circulation of rats was extended significantly because of a reduction in the rate of the rapid alpha-phase of clearance. The enzymatic properties and fibrinolytic activity of these mutants in vitro were not significantly different from those of wild-type t-PA. We conclude that tyrosine 67 comprises a key determinant in the clearance of t-PA by a specific hepatic receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1506800974,"We have examined the kinetics of interaction between Escherichia coli DNA gyrase and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog 5'-adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP) in the presence and absence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, [alpha-32P]ADPNP binds extremely slowly to gyrase, with an apparent second-order rate constant (k1) of 120 M-1 min-1. Similarly, the limited negative supercoiling of closed-circular DNA caused by ADPNP binding is slow, requiring at least 2 h to reach completion in the presence of 100 microM ADPNP. A very slow but detectable rate of dissociation of ADPNP from gyrase was measured, with a rate constant of 3.5 x 10(-4) min-1. The calculated dissociation constant for ADPNP is thus 2.9 microM. ADPNP is a potent competitive inhibitor of ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling. Inhibition is established much more rapidly than can be accounted for by the slow rate of ADPNP binding in the absence of ATP. We have found that ATP can accelerate the rate of [32P]ADPNP binding by more than 15-fold (k1 = 1,850 M-1 min-1). The ATP-promoted rate enhancement requires the presence of DNA; in the absence of DNA, ATP has no effect on the rate of binding. Relaxed closed-circular, nicked-circular, and linear pBR322 DNA are all equally effective cofactors for ATP-stimulated binding of ADPNP. After a short lag, the presence of ATP also greatly speeds up ADPNP dissociation from gyrase bound initially to closed-circular DNA, with the restoration of DNA supercoiling activity. This effect is not observed in the presence of nicked-circular or linear DNA, suggesting that ADPNP dissociates more rapidly from gyrase bound to supercoiled DNA. The results of ADPNP binding provide evidence for cooperative interactions between the nucleotide binding sites. To account for these data, a model is proposed for the interaction of nucleotides at the two ATP binding sites on DNA gyrase."
https://openalex.org/W1531146617,"Fragmin from plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum binds G-actin and severs F-actin in the presence of Ca2+ over 10(-6) M. The fragmin-actin complex consisting of fragmin and G-actin nucleates actin polymerization and caps the barbed (fast growing) end of F-actin, regardless of the concentrations of Ca2+, and the actin filaments are shortened. Actin kinase purified from plasmodium abolishes the nucleation and capping activities of the complex by phosphorylating actin of the fragmin-actin complex (Furuhashi, K., and Hatano, S. (1990) J. Cell. Biol. 111, 1081-1087). This inactivation of the complex leads to production of long actin filaments. We obtained evidence that Physarum actin is phosphorylated by actin kinase at Thr-201, and probably at Thr-202 and/or Thr-203, with 1 mol of phosphate distributed among them. This finding raises the possibility that the site of phosphorylation, Thr-201 to Thr-203, is positioned on the pointed (slow growing) end domain of the actin molecule, because growth of actin filaments from the fragmin-actin complex occurs only from the pointed end. These observations are consistent with a model of the three-dimensional structure of G-actin. Inactivation of the fragmen-actin complex may follow phosphorylation of the pointed end domain of actin."

Membrane immunofluorescence of ICP10 transformed cells with antibodies to synthetic peptides located upstream or downstream of the TM indicates that ICP10 is a membrane-spanning protein. Site-directed and deletion mutants were used to further characterize ICP10-PK. Mutation of Gly106 in catalytic motif I or of the invariant Lys in catalytic motif II, and deletion of both motifs (amino acids 106-178) did not eliminate kinase activity. PK activity was retained by the invariant Lys mutant expressed in bacteria and following protein separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to membrane filters. Both ICP10 and the invariant Lys mutant bound 14C-labeled rho-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine, an ATP affinity analog. The deletion mutant had 4-fold lower kinase activity than ICP10-PK, and it was insensitive to Mn2+, suggesting that these motifs are involved in Mn2+ activation of kinase activity. PK activity was lost by deletion of the TM segment (amino acid residues 85-106)."
https://openalex.org/W1554685521,"The effect of flanking host sequences on the cleavage step of the in vitro Mu DNA strand transfer reaction was investigated. Insertion of a mini-Mu molecule into certain sites in pUC19 results in insertions that demonstrate a decreased ability to form Type 1 complexes in subsequent rounds of transposition. Similarly, changes in the flanking host sequences directly adjacent to the Mu ends by in vitro mutagenesis can also result in Type 1-deficient mini-Mu molecules. Further examination of the inhibition revealed that Type 1 deficient mini-Mu molecules are capable of forming uncut synaptic complexes at normal levels but are compromised in their ability to serve as substrates for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis at the Mu ends. This cleavage defect can be overcome by addition of the Mu B protein and ATP to the reaction. Our data suggest that one of the roles of the B protein may be to provide a mechanism whereby Mu prophages with inhibitory flanking sequences can overcome this obstacle and avoid being trapped at unproductive locations."

A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14250-14255). It had been assumed that this cDNA, termed TRG for tunicamycin resistance gene, encoded GPT enzyme. However, other functions were not ruled out. Thus, by one of several mechanisms, the TRG protein could have instead functioned by activation of the transfected host's endogenous GPT enzyme. To analyze the biochemical function of the TRG protein, hamster TRG cDNA was stably expressed at high levels in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In addition, several antipeptide polyclonal antibodies directed against the predicted TRG protein were obtained. With these tools in hand, experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that the TRG encodes GPT enzyme, as well as to rule out other possible functions for the TRG protein. These experiments included examination of the effects of solubilization of membranes on TRG-dependent GPT activity, the apparent binding of tunicamycin to the TRG protein, and the immunoadsorption of GPT activity with TRG protein-specific antibodies. From these results, we conclude that the hamster TRG most likely encodes GPT enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1554203819,"The steroid hormone aldosterone regulates reabsorptive Na+ transport across specific high resistance epithelia. The increase in Na+ transport induced by aldosterone is dependent on protein synthesis and is due, in part, to an increase in Na+ conductance of the apical membrane mediated by amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. To examine whether an increment in the biochemical pool of Na+ channels expressed at the apical cell surface is a mechanism by which aldosterone increases apical membrane Na+ conductance, apical cell-surface proteins from the epithelial cell line A6 were specifically labeled by an enzyme-catalyzed radioiodination procedure following exposure of cells to aldosterone. Labeled Na+ channels were immunoprecipitated to quantify the biochemical pool of Na+ channels at the apical cell surface. The activation of Na+ transport across A6 cells by aldosterone was not accompanied by alterations in the biochemical pool of Na+ channels at the apical plasma membrane, despite a 3.7-4.2-fold increase in transepithelial Na+ transport. Similarly, no change in the distribution of immunoreactive protein was resolved by immunofluorescence microscopy. The oligomeric subunit composition of the channel remained unaltered, with one exception. A 75,000-Da polypeptide and a broad 70,000-Da polypeptide were observed in controls. Following addition of aldosterone, the 75,000-Da polypeptide was not resolved, and the 70,000-Da polypeptide was the major polypeptide found in this molecular mass region. Aldosterone did not alter rates of Na+ channel biosynthesis. These data suggest that neither changes in rates of Na+ channel biosynthesis nor changes in its apical cell-surface expression are required for activation of transepithelial Na+ transport by aldosterone. Post-translational modification of the Na+ channel, possibly the 75,000 or 70,000-Da polypeptide, may be one of the cellular events required for Na+ channel activation by aldosterone."

C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14784-14790). More recently, persistent activation (48 h) of the inhibitory adenylylcyclase pathway has been shown to cross-regulate the stimulatory pathway (i) enhancing the maximal response of beta-adrenergic agonits, (ii) increasing the expression of beta-adrenergic receptor, and (iii) reducing the ED50 for the isoproterenol-stimulated response by 50-fold (Hadcock, J. R., Port, J. D., and Malbon, C. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11915-11922). Here, we report that short term activation (60 min) of the inhibitory adenylylcyclase pathway of hamster smooth muscle DDT1MF-2 cells with the A1-adenosine receptor agonist N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) likewise enhances the stimulatory adenylylcyclase response to the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. The PIA effect was exerted at the level of the receptor, i.e., the beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated response was enhanced, whereas the guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate)- and forskolin-stimulated adenylylcyclase activities were largely unaffected. In contrast to longer term persistent activation of the inhibitory pathway, receptor number and affinity for 125I-labeled cyanopindolol were unaffected. Metabolic labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate and immuneprecipitation of beta-adrenergic receptors detected phosphorylation of the receptor in unstimulated cells and marked phosphorylation in cells challenged with epinephrine. When cells were challenged short term with PIA, the state of beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation was reduced by 75%. Treating cells with PIA in combination with the cAMP analog 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine cyclic AMP attenuated the enhanced receptor-mediated adenylylcyclase response observed in cells treated with PIA alone. These data suggest that short term cross-regulation from the inhibitory to stimulatory adenylylcyclase pathways results in the following: (i) decreased intracellular cAMP levels and protein kinase A activity, (ii) reduced phosphorylation of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor in the basal (i.e. unstimulated) state, and (iii) enhanced receptor-mediated activation of Gs."

In this paper, we show, contrary to the previously published report, that substitution of Glu171 of CAP fails to result in a specific defect in transcription activation at the lac promoter. Furthermore, in this paper, we show that substitution of each other negatively charged amino acid of CAP that is solvent-accessible in the CAP-DNA complex fails to result in a specific defect in transcription activation at the lac promoter. We conclude that CAP does not use an acidic activating region transcription activation mechanism in transcription activation at the lac promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1543553963,"The massive nonselective and reversible phosphorylation of histone H1 during mitosis is a universal phenomenon among eukaryotes. The growth-associated kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is identical to the maturation promoting factor, a key regulator of the cell cycle. Here we showed that growth-associated kinase, isolated from mitotic HeLa cells which were capable of phosphorylating HeLa H1 in vitro with high activity and mostly at the same sites phosphorylated during mitosis in vivo (assayed by two-dimensional analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides), did not significantly phosphorylate chromatin-bound or nuclear H1 in vitro. Its inability to phosphorylate chromatin-bound H1 did not change when the amount of kinase was increased or the incubation was prolonged. The resistance of chromatin-bound H1 to phosphorylation did not result from chromatin aggregation. Rapid phosphorylation of H1 in vitro, as well as in a nuclear system, was restored when NaCl concentrations were raised above 200 mM where H1:DNA interactions are weakened. At 300 mM NaCl, chromatin-bound H1 was phosphorylated in a subset of the sites observed for free H1 phosphorylated in vitro. These results suggest that active displacement of H1 from chromatin DNA may take place before H1 can be fully phosphorylated during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1528729535,"The two fundamental parameters of corticotropin (ACTH) secretion are the number of secreting corticotropes and the amount of ACTH secreted by each cell. We have measured these parameters in rat corticotropes in response to increasing concentrations of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or arginine vasopressin (AVP). Increasing concentrations of AVP stimulated more corticotropes to secrete, while the amount of ACTH each cell secreted remained relatively fixed (nongraded secretory response). Conversely, increasing concentrations of CRF stimulated more ACTH secretion per cell (graded secretory response), while the number of secretory cells remained relatively constant. When viewed from the perspective of a single corticotrope, it was clear that CRF and AVP induced completely distinct specific responses. We have previously shown, and provide further evidence here, that secretory responses to CRF or AVP occur in the same cell. It is therefore apparent that a single corticotrope is able to generate either a graded, or a nongraded secretory response. We have also considered the potential intracellular changes that must direct graded or nongraded secretion. It is generally accepted that CRF stimulates activation of adenylate cyclase, whereas AVP activates phosphoinositidase in pituitary corticotropes. Our findings, and others surveyed here, suggest that the activation of adenylate cyclase results in graded secretion, while the activation of phosphoinositidase induces the nongraded secretion. Graded or nongraded secretion may therefore be linked to specific second messengers. It is hypothesized that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated release of an intracellular Ca2+ store constitutes a mechanism whereby phosphoinositidase-coupled hormones set in motion the nongraded secretory response. These findings suggest novel functions for individual second messengers."
https://openalex.org/W1561153880,"Since cytochrome c and acetylated cytochrome c disappear from the circulation with a half-life of 4 min, these proteins cannot be used for in vivo detection of superoxide radicals and related metabolites. To determine superoxide and other radicals in vivo, a cytochrome c derivative (SMAC) was synthesized by linking 1 mol of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) butyl ester (SM) to cytochrome c, followed by acetylation of its lysyl amino groups. SMAC retained 8 and 80% of cytochrome c activity to react with ascorbyl and superoxide radicals, respectively. However, SMAC did not serve as a substrate for cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase. When injected intravenously to the rat, SMAC circulated bound to albumin with a half-life of 130 min. SMAC was rapidly reduced in the circulation of intact animals. Treatment of animals with paraquat markedly enhanced the reduction of the circulating SMAC. We have synthesized an SM-conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD) derivative (SM-SOD) that circulates bound to albumin with a half-life of 6 h. Kinetic analysis revealed that SM-SOD effectively inhibited the superoxide-dependent reduction of SMAC either in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM albumin. However, the reduction of the circulating SMAC was not inhibited by SM-SOD both in normal and paraquat-treated animals. Plasma samples from both animal groups also reduced cytochrome c and SMAC by an SOD-insensitive mechanism. However, after treatment with ascorbate oxidase, both plasma samples lost their activity to reduce cytochrome c and SMAC. These and other results suggest that ascorbyl radical might principally be responsible for the reduction of circulating SMAC and that plasma levels of ascorbyl radical might increase in paraquat-treated animals."
https://openalex.org/W1480125350,"We used lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination to investigate the lumenal polypeptide composition of rat hepatocyte endosomes. A chemical conjugate of asialoorosomucoid and lactoperoxidase that binds specifically to hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptors was perfused through isolated rat livers at 16 degrees C in the presence of mannan, resulting in the accumulation of ligand in early endosomes. Endosome containing low density vesicle fractions were subsequently isolated from sucrose gradients of microsomes, and the lactoperoxidase moiety was used to catalyze the iodination of lumenal-facing proteins. After gel electrophoresis, 125I-labeled early endosomes reproducibly showed a distinct 125I-polypeptide profile containing prominently labeled bands migrating at 43, 52, 58, 90, 110, 135, 230, and greater than 300 kDa. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (43-, 52-, and 58-kDa subunits) was by far the predominantly labeled protein even when iodinations were performed under conditions of receptor-ligand dissociation, and we conclude that it is the most abundant hepatocyte early endosomal protein. Furthermore, the iodination profile of the three asialoglycoprotein receptor subunits differed strikingly from their chemical amounts. Using immunoprecipitation, we directly identified the Na+,K(+)-ATPase; to our knowledge, this is the first biochemical evidence for the Na+,K(+)-ATPase in rat hepatocyte early endosomes. We also directly identified receptors for mannose 6-phosphate, epidermal growth factor, transferrin, and polymeric IgA in 125I-labeled early endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1641574298,"Abstract Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a ubiquitous, multifunctional protein-seryl/threonyl kinase that has been implicated in cellular regulation. Synthetic peptides were patterned after three highly conserved regions in CK2: the N terminus (CK2-NT); the lysine-rich, kinase subdomain III segment (CK2-III) (nomenclature of Hanks et al. (Hanks, S. K., Quinn, A. M., and Hunter, T. (1988) Science 241, 42-52)); and a 10-residue segment located near kinase subdomain X that is shared between CK2 and p34cdc2 (CK2/cdc2). The CK2-III and CK2/cdc2 peptides markedly stimulated the autophosphorylation of the alpha- and alpha'-subunits of purified CK2 from sea star oocytes, and they elicited up to 2-fold increases in its casein or phosvitin phosphotransferase activity. These peptides completely reversed nearly total inhibition of CK2 phosphotransferase activity toward itself, casein, and phosvitin by either heparin or poly(Glu,Tyr; 4:1), whereas CK2-NT was ineffective. Elution of CK2 from heparin-agarose with the CK2-III peptide indicated that this region of CK2 might mediate heparin binding to CK2. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies developed against both CK2-III and CK2/cdc2, but not CK2-NT, also produced up to 1.8-fold enhancements of the casein and phosvitin phosphotransferase activities of purified CK2. All three of the antipeptide antibody preparations immunoreacted with the alpha- and alpha'-subunits of CK2 on Western blots. These studies indicate that kinase subdomains III and X are involved in the modulation of CK2 phosphotransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1576491180,"Dietary fish oils are implicated in reducing the incidence of coronary heart disease, perhaps by altering the properties of plasma lipoproteins. The hypothesis that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in fish oils produce changes in lipid ordering and dynamics within high density lipoprotein (HDL), thereby potentially modifying cholesterol transport, is investigated here. Rabbits were fed a diet supplemented with either 10% (by weight) menhaden oil (MO), a fish oil rich in omega-3 PUFAs, or hydrogenated cottonseed oil for a period of 12 weeks. HDL was isolated by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation from plasma drawn every 2 weeks. Gas chromatography confirmed that the predominant omega-3 PUFAs of fish oils, eicosapentaenoic 20:5 and docosahexaenoic 22:6 acids, were only incorporated into the triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesteryl ester constituents of lipoproteins from rabbits on the MO diet. ESR of 5- and 16-doxyl stearic acids demonstrates that molecular order and dynamics within the outer monolayer of HDL is virtually unaffected. In contrast, ESR of cholesteryl 12-doxyl stearate indicates order is less within the inner apolar core of the lipoprotein for the MO diet than for the hydrogenated cottonseed oil diet. Fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene supports this finding. The greater disorder detected within HDL from rabbits fed fish oil may result in an enhancement of cholesterol exchange between lipoproteins and between lipoproteins and cells, which may have anti-atherogenic ramifications."

C alpha 12 cells were generated by transfecting mouse L cells with an expression vector coding for the mouse C alpha catalytic subunit of PKA and were shown to contain 2.5-fold more PKA activity than L cells. RAB10 cells were generated by transfection with an expression vector for a mutant regulatory subunit and had 10-fold lower levels of PKA activity than L cells. AP induction by 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (CPT-cAMP) was found to be 2-fold greater in C alpha 12 cells than in L cells, while RAB10 cells lacked any induction of AP in response to CPT-cAMP. Northern blot and solution hybridization analyses of AP mRNA showed that induced AP mRNA levels were comparable in C alpha 12 and in L cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that AP protein levels were greater in C alpha 12 cells and suggested that the increased AP protein level resulted from either increased stability of the AP protein or increased rate of translation of the AP mRNA. In contrast, Northern blot analysis of the RAB10 cells failed to detect AP mRNA after CPT-cAMP treatment and suggested that PKA is required for induction of AP mRNA. Stimulation of endogenous cAMP levels by treatment with prostaglandin E1 gave similar effects on AP activity as those seen with CPT-cAMP. These results indicate that cellular levels of PKA can determine the magnitude of cellular response to hormonal stimulation and also suggest that PKA can regulate AP gene expression at both the level of the AP mRNA and AP protein."
