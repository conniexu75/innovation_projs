https://openalex.org/W2083784041,"In contrast to perceived nonselectivity, biochemical profiling reveals that currently available HDAC inhibitors predominantly inhibit only class I and IIb HDAC enzymes. A new pan-selective inhibitor, obtained by screening a focused library, provides an important tool for studying class IIa HDACs. The broad study of histone deacetylases in chemistry, biology and medicine relies on tool compounds to derive mechanistic insights. A phylogenetic analysis of class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) as targets of a comprehensive, structurally diverse panel of inhibitors revealed unexpected isoform selectivity even among compounds widely perceived as nonselective. The synthesis and study of a focused library of cinnamic hydroxamates allowed the identification of, to our knowledge, the first nonselective HDAC inhibitor. These data will guide a more informed use of HDAC inhibitors as chemical probes and therapeutic agents."

https://openalex.org/W2119383776,"The number of dendritic spines is reduced in the postmortem brains of individuals with schizophrenia. Revealing a potential mechanism of such change, this study finds that the schizophrenia-associated protein DISC1 regulates the Rho GTPase pathway to modulate dendritic spine size. Synaptic spines are dynamic structures that regulate neuronal responsiveness and plasticity. We examined the role of the schizophrenia risk factor DISC1 in the maintenance of spine morphology and function. We found that DISC1 anchored Kalirin-7 (Kal-7), regulating access of Kal-7 to Rac1 and controlling the duration and intensity of Rac1 activation in response to NMDA receptor activation in both cortical cultures and rat brain in vivo. These results explain why Rac1 and its activator (Kal-7) serve as important mediators of spine enlargement and why constitutive Rac1 activation decreases spine size. This mechanism likely underlies disturbances in glutamatergic neurotransmission that have been frequently reported in schizophrenia that can lead to alteration of dendritic spines with consequential major pathological changes in brain function. Furthermore, the concept of a signalosome involving disease-associated factors, such as DISC1 and glutamate, may well contribute to the multifactorial and polygenetic characteristics of schizophrenia."

We identified an association with telomere length on 3q26 (rs12696304, combined P = 3.72 x 10(-14)) at a locus that includes TERC, which encodes the telomerase RNA component. Each copy of the minor allele of rs12696304 was associated with an approximately 75-base-pair reduction in mean telomere length, equivalent to approximately 3.6 years of age-related telomere-length attrition."
https://openalex.org/W2123649103,"Osteoporosis results from misregulation of bone catabolism and bone anabolism, resulting in severe bone loss. Most current therapies act by decreasing bone catabolism, but targeting bone anabolism is more desired, because once bone is lost, it is difficult to replace. In a new report by Gerard Karsenty and his colleagues, they show that orally delivered pharmacological targeting of serotonin synthesis in the gut is sufficient to increase bone anabolism and thus restore lost bone in rat and mouse models of well-established osteoporosis ( pages 264–265 ). Osteoporosis is a disease of low bone mass most often caused by an increase in bone resorption that is not sufficiently compensated for by a corresponding increase in bone formation1. As gut-derived serotonin (GDS) inhibits bone formation2, we asked whether hampering its biosynthesis could treat osteoporosis through an anabolic mechanism (that is, by increasing bone formation). We synthesized and used LP533401, a small molecule inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph-1), the initial enzyme in GDS biosynthesis. Oral administration of this small molecule once daily for up to six weeks acts prophylactically or therapeutically, in a dose–dependent manner, to treat osteoporosis in ovariectomized rodents because of an isolated increase in bone formation. These results provide a proof of principle that inhibiting GDS biosynthesis could become a new anabolic treatment for osteoporosis."

https://openalex.org/W1971271231,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be obtained by the introduction of defined factors into somatic cells. The combination of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4 (which we term OSK) constitutes the minimal requirement for generating iPS cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. These cells are thought to resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) on the basis of global gene expression analyses; however, few studies have tested the ability and efficiency of iPS cells to contribute to chimaerism, colonization of germ tissues, and most importantly, germ-line transmission and live birth from iPS cells produced by tetraploid complementation. Using genomic analyses of ESC genes that have roles in pluripotency and fusion-mediated somatic cell reprogramming, here we show that the transcription factor Tbx3 significantly improves the quality of iPS cells. iPS cells generated with OSK and Tbx3 (OSKT) are superior in both germ-cell contribution to the gonads and germ-line transmission frequency. However, global gene expression profiling could not distinguish between OSK and OSKT iPS cells. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of Tbx3-binding sites in ESCs suggests that Tbx3 regulates pluripotency-associated and reprogramming factors, in addition to sharing many common downstream regulatory targets with Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Smad1. This study underscores the intrinsic qualitative differences between iPS cells generated by different methods, and highlights the need to rigorously characterize iPS cells beyond in vitro studies."
https://openalex.org/W2018305067,"Activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB(1)) is universally recognized as a powerful endogenous orexigenic signal, but the detailed underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. Using combined genetic and pharmacological approaches in mice, we found that ventral striatal CB(1) receptors exerted a hypophagic action through inhibition of GABAergic transmission. Conversely, brain CB(1) receptors modulating excitatory transmission mediated the well-known orexigenic effects of cannabinoids."
https://openalex.org/W2009614075,"The declaration of the human influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1/09) raised important questions, including origin and host range [1], [2]. Two of the three pandemics in the last century resulted in the spread of virus to pigs (H1N1, 1918; H3N2, 1968) with subsequent independent establishment and evolution within swine worldwide [3]. A key public and veterinary health consideration in the context of the evolving pandemic is whether the H1N1/09 virus could become established in pig populations [4]. We performed an infection and transmission study in pigs with A/California/07/09. In combination, clinical, pathological, modified influenza A matrix gene real time RT-PCR and viral genomic analyses have shown that infection results in the induction of clinical signs, viral pathogenesis restricted to the respiratory tract, infection dynamics consistent with endemic strains of influenza A in pigs, virus transmissibility between pigs and virus-host adaptation events. Our results demonstrate that extant H1N1/09 is fully capable of becoming established in global pig populations. We also show the roles of viral receptor specificity in both transmission and tissue tropism. Remarkably, following direct inoculation of pigs with virus quasispecies differing by amino acid substitutions in the haemagglutinin receptor-binding site, only virus with aspartic acid at position 225 (225D) was detected in nasal secretions of contact infected pigs. In contrast, in lower respiratory tract samples from directly inoculated pigs, with clearly demonstrable pulmonary pathology, there was apparent selection of a virus variant with glycine (225G). These findings provide potential clues to the existence and biological significance of viral receptor-binding variants with 225D and 225G during the 1918 pandemic [5]."
https://openalex.org/W2064969847,"Synaptic cell adhesion molecules regulate various steps of synapse formation. The trans-synaptic adhesion between postsynaptic NGL-3 (for netrin-G ligand-3) and presynaptic LAR (for leukocyte antigen-related) regulates excitatory synapse formation in a bidirectional manner. However, little is known about the molecular details of the NGL-3-LAR adhesion and whether two additional LAR family proteins, protein-tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPdelta), and PTPsigma, also interact with NGL-3 and are involved in synapse formation. We report here that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NGL-3, containing nine LRRs, interacts with the first two fibronectin III (FNIII) domains of LAR to induce bidirectional synapse formation. Moreover, Gln-96 in the first LRR motif of NGL-3 is critical for LAR binding and induction of presynaptic differentiation. PTPdelta and PTPsigma also interact with NGL-3 via their first two FNIII domains. These two interactions promote synapse formation in a different manner; the PTPsigma-NGL-3 interaction promotes synapse formation in a bidirectional manner, whereas the PTPdelta-NGL-3 interaction instructs only presynaptic differentiation in a unidirectional manner. mRNAs encoding LAR family proteins display overlapping and differential expression patterns in various brain regions. These results suggest that trans-synaptic adhesion between NGL-3 and the three LAR family proteins regulates excitatory synapse formation in shared and distinct neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2005284789,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism by activating PTH type I receptor (PTH1R). Here we show that transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) forms an endocytic complex with PTH1R in response to PTH and regulates signalling by PTH and TGF-beta. TbetaRII directly phosphorylates the PTH1R cytoplasmic domain, which modulates PTH-induced endocytosis of the PTH1R-TbetaRII complex. Deletion of TbetaRII in osteoblasts increases the cell-surface expression of PTH1R and augments PTH signalling. Conditional knockout of TbetaRII in osteoblasts in mice results in a high bone mass with increased trabecular bone and decreased cortical bone, similar to the bone phenotype in mice expressing a constitutively active PTH1R. Disruption of PTH signalling by injection of PTH(7-34) or ablation of PTH1R rescues the bone phenotype of TbetaRII knockout mice. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized function for TbetaRII and a mechanism for integration of PTH and local growth factor at the membrane receptor level."
https://openalex.org/W2084151383,"The oncogenic PIM1 kinase has been implicated as a cofactor for c-MYC in prostate carcinogenesis. In this study, we show that in human prostate tumors, coexpression of c-MYC and PIM1 is associated with higher Gleason grades. Using a tissue recombination model coupled with lentiviral-mediated gene transfer we find that Pim1 is weakly oncogenic in naive adult mouse prostatic epithelium. However, it cooperates dramatically with c-MYC to induce prostate cancer within 6-weeks. Importantly, c-MYC/Pim1 synergy is critically dependent on Pim1 kinase activity. c-MYC/Pim1 tumors showed increased levels of the active serine-62 (S62) phosphorylated form of c-MYC. Grafts expressing a phosphomimetic c-MYCS62D mutant had higher rates of proliferation than grafts expressing wild type c-MYC but did not form tumors like c-MYC/Pim1 grafts, indicating that Pim1 cooperativity with c-MYC in vivo involves additional mechanisms other than enhancement of c-MYC activity by S62 phosphorylation. c-MYC/Pim1-induced prostate carcinomas show evidence of neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Additional studies, including the identification of tumor cells coexpressing androgen receptor and NE cell markers synaptophysin and Ascl1 suggested that NE tumors arose from adenocarcinoma cells through transdifferentiation. These results directly show functional cooperativity between c-MYC and PIM1 in prostate tumorigenesis in vivo and support efforts for targeting PIM1 in prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2149472519,"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) exhibits natural tropism for dendritic cells and represents the prototypic infection that elicits protective CD8(+) T cell (cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)) immunity. Here we have harnessed the immunobiology of this arenavirus for vaccine delivery. By using producer cells constitutively synthesizing the viral glycoprotein (GP), it was possible to replace the gene encoding LCMV GP with vaccine antigens to create replication-defective vaccine vectors. These rLCMV vaccines elicited CTL responses that were equivalent to or greater than those elicited by recombinant adenovirus 5 or recombinant vaccinia virus in their magnitude and cytokine profiles, and they exhibited more effective protection in several models. In contrast to recombinant adenovirus 5, rLCMV failed to elicit vector-specific antibody immunity, which facilitated re-administration of the same vector for booster vaccination. In addition, rLCMV elicited T helper type 1 CD4+ T cell responses and protective neutralizing antibodies to vaccine antigens. These features, together with low seroprevalence in humans, suggest that rLCMV may show utility as a vaccine platform against infectious diseases and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999906037,"Genome-wide analyses of human lung adenocarcinoma have identified regions of consistent copy-number gain or loss, but in many cases the oncogenes and tumor suppressors presumed to reside in these loci remain to be determined. Here we identify the downstream of tyrosine kinase (Dok) family members Dok1, Dok2 and Dok3 as lung tumor suppressors. Single, double or triple compound loss of these genes in mice results in lung cancer, with penetrance and latency dependent on the number of lost Dok alleles. Cancer development is preceded by an aberrant expansion and signaling profile of alveolar type II cells and bronchioalveolar stem cells. In human lung adenocarcinoma, we identify DOK2 as a target of copy-number loss and mRNA downregulation and find that DOK2 suppresses lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Given the genomic localization of DOK2, we propose it as an 8p21.3 haploinsufficient human lung tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2075640602,"Background Sarcoidosis is a poorly understood chronic inflammatory condition. Infiltration of affected organs by lymphocytes is characteristic of sarcoidosis, however previous reports suggest that circulating lymphocyte counts are low in some patients with the disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood in a cohort of sarcoidosis patients to determine the prevalence, severity, and clinical features associated with lymphopenia in major lymphocyte subsets. Methodology/Principal Findings Lymphocyte subsets in 28 sarcoid patients were analyzed using flow cytometry to determine the percentage of CD4, CD8, and CD19 positive cells. Greater than 50% of patients had abnormally low CD4, CD8, or CD19 counts (p<4×10−10). Lymphopenia was profound in some cases, and five of the patients had absolute CD4 counts below 200. CD4, CD8, and CD19 lymphocyte subset counts were significantly correlated (Spearman's rho 0.57, p = 0.0017), and 10 patients had low counts in all three subsets. Patients with severe organ system involvement including neurologic, cardiac, ocular, and advanced pulmonary disease had lower lymphocyte subset counts as a group than those patients with less severe manifestations (CD4 p = 0.0043, CD8 p = 0.026, CD19 p = 0.033). No significant relationships were observed between various medical therapies and lymphocyte counts, and lymphopenia was present in patients who were not receiving any medical therapy. Conclusions/Significance Significant lymphopenia involving CD4, CD8, and CD19 positive cells was common in sarcoidosis patients and correlated with disease severity. Our findings suggest that lymphopenia relates more to disease pathology than medical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2103162105,"Exogenous retroviruses are obligate cellular parasites that co-opt a number of host proteins and functions to enable their replication and spread. Several host factors that restrict HIV and other retroviral infections have also recently been described. Here we demonstrate that Mov10, a protein associated with P-bodies that has a putative RNA-helicase domain, when overexpressed in cells can inhibit the production of infectious retroviruses. Interestingly, reducing the endogenous Mov10 levels in virus-producing cells through siRNA treatment also modestly suppresses HIV infectivity. The actions of Mov10 are not limited to HIV, however, as ectopic expression of Mov10 restricts the production of other lentiviruses as well as the gammaretrovirus, murine leukemia virus. We found that HIV produced in the presence of high levels of Mov10 is restricted at the pre-reverse transcription stage in target cells. Finally, we show that either helicase mutation or truncation of the C-terminal half of Mov10, where a putative RNA-helicase domain is located, maintained most of its HIV inhibition; whereas removing the N-terminal half of Mov10 completely abolished its activity on HIV. Together these results suggest that Mov10 could be required during the lentiviral lifecycle and that its perturbation disrupts generation of infectious viral particles. Because Mov10 is implicated as part of the P-body complex, these findings point to the potential role of cytoplasmic RNA processing machinery in infectious retroviral production."
https://openalex.org/W2003681003,"Membrane lipids play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with conformational changes, oligomerization and/or aggregation of Alzheimer's β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Yet conflicting data have been reported on the respective effect of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (GSLs) on the supramolecular assembly of Aβ peptides. The aim of the present study was to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol modulates the interaction between Aβ1–40 and chemically defined GSLs (GalCer, LacCer, GM1, GM3). Using the Langmuir monolayer technique, we show that Aβ1–40 selectively binds to GSLs containing a 2-OH group in the acyl chain of the ceramide backbone (HFA-GSLs). In contrast, Aβ1–40 did not interact with GSLs containing a nonhydroxylated fatty acid (NFA-GSLs). Cholesterol inhibited the interaction of Aβ1–40 with HFA-GSLs, through dilution of the GSL in the monolayer, but rendered the initially inactive NFA-GSLs competent for Aβ1–40 binding. Both crystallographic data and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the active conformation of HFA-GSL involves a H-bond network that restricts the orientation of the sugar group of GSLs in a parallel orientation with respect to the membrane. This particular conformation is stabilized by the 2-OH group of the GSL. Correspondingly, the interaction of Aβ1–40 with HFA-GSLs is strongly inhibited by NaF, an efficient competitor of H-bond formation. For NFA-GSLs, this is the OH group of cholesterol that constrains the glycolipid to adopt the active L-shape conformation compatible with sugar-aromatic CH-π stacking interactions involving residue Y10 of Aβ1–40. We conclude that cholesterol can either inhibit or facilitate membrane-Aβ interactions through fine tuning of glycosphingolipid conformation. These data shed some light on the complex molecular interplay between cell surface GSLs, cholesterol and Aβ peptides, and on the influence of this molecular ballet on Aβ-membrane interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2015593651,"Ca(2+) channels and calmodulin (CaM) are two prominent signalling hubs that synergistically affect functions as diverse as cardiac excitability, synaptic plasticity and gene transcription. It is therefore fitting that these hubs are in some sense coordinated, as the opening of Ca(V)1-2 Ca(2+) channels are regulated by a single CaM constitutively complexed with channels. The Ca(2+)-free form of CaM (apoCaM) is already pre-associated with the isoleucine-glutamine (IQ) domain on the channel carboxy terminus, and subsequent Ca(2+) binding to this 'resident' CaM drives conformational changes that then trigger regulation of channel opening. Another potential avenue for channel-CaM coordination could arise from the absence of Ca(2+) regulation in channels lacking a pre-associated CaM. Natural fluctuations in CaM concentrations might then influence the fraction of regulable channels and, thereby, the overall strength of Ca(2+) feedback. However, the prevailing view has been that the ultrastrong affinity of channels for apoCaM ensures their saturation with CaM, yielding a significant form of concentration independence between Ca(2+) channels and CaM. Here we show that significant exceptions to this autonomy exist, by combining electrophysiology (to characterize channel regulation) with optical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor determination of free-apoCaM concentration in live cells. This approach translates quantitative CaM biochemistry from the traditional test-tube context into the realm of functioning holochannels within intact cells. From this perspective, we find that long splice forms of Ca(V)1.3 and Ca(V)1.4 channels include a distal carboxy tail that resembles an enzyme competitive inhibitor that retunes channel affinity for apoCaM such that natural CaM variations affect the strength of Ca(2+) feedback modulation. Given the ubiquity of these channels, the connection between ambient CaM levels and Ca(2+) entry through channels is broadly significant for Ca(2+) homeostasis. Strategies such as ours promise key advances for the in situ analysis of signalling molecules resistant to in vitro reconstitution, such as Ca(2+) channels."

https://openalex.org/W2062470451,"Cancer cells acquire characteristics of deregulated growth, survival and increased metastatic potential. Genetic mutations that provide a selective advantage by promoting these characteristics have been termed ‘drivers,’ whereas mutations that do not contribute to disease initiation/progression are termed ‘passengers.’ The advent of high-throughput methodologies has facilitated large-scale screening of cancer genomes and the subsequent identification of novel somatic mutations. Although this approach has generated valuable results, the data remain incomplete until the functional consequences of these mutations are determined to differentiate potential drivers from passengers. ROCK1 is an essential effector kinase downstream of Rho GTPases, an important pathway involved in cell migration. The Cancer Genome Project identified three nonsynonymous mutations in the ROCK1 gene. We now show that these somatic ROCK1 mutations lead to elevated kinase activity and drive actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that promote increased motility and decreased adhesion, characteristics of cancer progression. Mapping of the kinase-interacting regions of the carboxy terminus combined with structural modeling provides an insight into how these mutations likely affect the regulation of ROCK1. Consistent with the frequency of ROCK1 mutations in human cancer, these results support the conclusion that there is selective pressure for the ROCK1 gene to acquire ‘driver’ mutations that result in kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2001369358,"Secondary sexual characteristics convey information about reproductive potential. In the same way that facial symmetry and masculinity, and shoulder-to-hip ratio convey information about reproductive/genetic quality in males, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) is a phenotypic cue to fertility, fecundity, neurodevelopmental resources in offspring, and overall health, and is indicative of ""good genes"" in women. Here, using fMRI, we found that males show activation in brain reward centers in response to naked female bodies when surgically altered to express an optimal (approximately 0.7) WHR with redistributed body fat, but relatively unaffected body mass index (BMI). Relative to presurgical bodies, brain activation to postsurgical bodies was observed in bilateral orbital frontal cortex. While changes in BMI only revealed activation in visual brain substrates, changes in WHR revealed activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area associated with reward processing and decision-making. When regressing ratings of attractiveness on brain activation, we observed activation in forebrain substrates, notably the nucleus accumbens, a forebrain nucleus highly involved in reward processes. These findings suggest that an hourglass figure (i.e., an optimal WHR) activates brain centers that drive appetitive sociality/attention toward females that represent the highest-quality reproductive partners. This is the first description of a neural correlate implicating WHR as a putative honest biological signal of female reproductive viability and its effects on men's neurological processing."
https://openalex.org/W2030735640,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) susceptibility differs between men and women and varies with ethnicity. This variability is not entirely explained by conventional CVD risk factors. We examined differences in circulating levels of 47 novel protein markers of CVD in 2561 men and women of African-American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicity, enrolled at geographically distinct sites.Participants (1,324 AAs, mean age 63.5 y, 71% women; 1,237 NHWs, mean age 58.9 y, 57% women) belonged to sibships ascertained on the basis of hypertension. Solid-phase immunoassays and immunoturbidometric, clot-based, chromogenic, and electrophoretic assays were used to measure the 47 protein markers in plasma or serum. Marker levels were log transformed and outliers were adjusted to within 4 SD. To identify markers independently associated with sex or ethnicity, we employed multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for conventional risk factors, prior history of CVD, medication use and lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol consumption and education). Generalized estimating equations were used to correct for intrafamilial correlations. After adjustment for the above covariates, female sex was associated with higher levels of 29 markers and lower levels of 6 markers. Female sex was independently associated with higher levels of several inflammatory markers as well as lipoproteins, adipokines, natriuretic peptides, vasoconstrictor peptides and markers of calcification and thrombosis. AA ethnicity was associated with higher levels of 19 markers and lower levels of 6 markers, including higher levels of several inflammatory makers, higher leptin and lower adiponectin levels, lower levels of vasodilator-natriuretic peptides, higher levels of vasoconstrictor-antidiuretic peptides and markers of calcification and thrombosis.Plasma levels of several novel protein markers of CVD differ significantly in the context of sex and ethnicity. These results have implications for individualized CVD risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2096549221,"Post-translational histone modifications are crucial for the regulation of numerous DNA-templated processes, and are thought to mediate both alteration of chromatin dynamics and recruitment of effector proteins to specific regions of the genome. In particular, histone Ser/Thr phosphorylation regulates multiple nuclear functions in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including transcription, DNA damage repair, mitosis, apoptosis and sporulation. Although modifications to chromatin during replication remain poorly understood, a number of recent studies have described acetylation of the histone H3 N-terminal alpha-helix (alphaN helix) at Lys 56 as a modification that is important for maintenance of genomic integrity during DNA replication and repair. Here, we report phosphorylation of H3 Thr 45 (H3-T45), a histone modification also located within the H3 alphaN helix in S. cerevisiae. Thr 45 phosphorylation peaks during DNA replication, and is mediated by the S phase kinase Cdc7-Dbf4 as part of a multiprotein complex identified in this study. Furthermore, loss of phosphorylated H3-T45 causes phenotypes consistent with replicative defects, and prolonged replication stress results in H3-T45 phosphorylation accumulation over time. Notably, the phenotypes described here are independent of Lys 56 acetylation status, and combinatorial mutations to both Thr 45 and Lys 56 of H3 cause synthetic growth defects. Together, these data identify and characterize H3-T45 phosphorylation as a replication-associated histone modification in budding yeast."
https://openalex.org/W2080616631,"Although overexpression of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) has been found associated with prostate diseases, the underlying mechanisms for NOS-related prostatic diseases remain unclear. One proposed mechanism is related to the S-nitrosylation of key regulatory proteins in cell-signaling pathways due to elevated levels of NO in the prostate. Thus, our primary objective was to identify S-nitrosylated targets in an immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell line, NPrEC.We treated NPrEC with nitroso-cysteine and used the biotin switch technique followed by gel-based separation and mass spectrometry protein identification (using the LTQ-Orbitrap) to discover S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteins in the treated cells. In parallel, we adapted a peptide pull-down methodology to locate the site(s) of S-nitrosylation on the protein SNO targets identified by the first technique. This combined approach identified 116 SNO proteins and determined the sites of modification for 82 of them. Over 60% of these proteins belong to four functional groups: cell structure/cell motility/protein trafficking, protein folding/protein response/protein assembly, mRNA splicing/processing/transcriptional regulation, and metabolism. Western blot analysis validated a subset of targets related to disease development (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, maspin, integrin beta4, alpha-catenin, karyopherin [importin] beta1, and elongation factor 1A1). We analyzed the SNO sequences for their primary and secondary structures, solvent accessibility, and three-dimensional structural context. We found that about 80% of the SNO sites that can be mapped into resolved structures are buried, of which approximately half have charged amino acids in their three-dimensional neighborhood, and the other half residing within primarily hydrophobic pockets.We here identified 116 potential SNO targets and mapped their putative SNO sites in NPrEC. Elucidation of how this post-translational modification alters the function of these proteins should shed light on the role of NO in prostate pathologies. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying SNO targets in prostate epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1968498467,"Background Most prior studies on selective attention in the setting of total sleep deprivation (SD) have focused on behavior or activation within fronto-parietal cognitive control areas. Here, we evaluated the effects of SD on the top-down biasing of activation of ventral visual cortex and on functional connectivity between cognitive control and other brain regions. Methodology/Principal Findings Twenty-three healthy young adult volunteers underwent fMRI after a normal night of sleep (RW) and after sleep deprivation in a counterbalanced manner while performing a selective attention task. During this task, pictures of houses or faces were randomly interleaved among scrambled images. Across different blocks, volunteers responded to house but not face pictures, face but not house pictures, or passively viewed pictures without responding. The appearance of task-relevant pictures was unpredictable in this paradigm. SD resulted in less accurate detection of target pictures without affecting the mean false alarm rate or response time. In addition to a reduction of fronto-parietal activation, attending to houses strongly modulated parahippocampal place area (PPA) activation during RW, but this attention-driven biasing of PPA activation was abolished following SD. Additionally, SD resulted in a significant decrement in functional connectivity between the PPA and two cognitive control areas, the left intraparietal sulcus and the left inferior frontal lobe. Conclusions/Significance SD impairs selective attention as evidenced by reduced selectivity in PPA activation. Further, reduction in fronto-parietal and ventral visual task-related activation suggests that it also affects sustained attention. Reductions in functional connectivity may be an important additional imaging parameter to consider in characterizing the effects of sleep deprivation on cognition."

In this study, we characterized biophysically the binding of S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6 and S100B to homologous domains of p63 and p73 in vitro by fluorescence anisotropy, analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical gel filtration. We found that S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6 and S100B proteins bound different p63 and p73 tetramerization domain variants and naturally occurring isoforms with varying affinities in a calcium-dependent manner. Additional interactions were observed with peptides derived from the p63 and p73 N-terminal transactivation domains. Importantly, S100 proteins bound p63 and p73 with different affinities in their different oligomeric states, similarly to the differential modes of binding to p53. On the basis of our data, we hypothesize that S100 proteins regulate the oligomerization state of all three p53 family members and their isoforms, with a potential physiological relevance in developmental and disease-related processes. The regulation of the p53 family by S100 is complicated and depends on the target preference of each individual S100 protein, the concentration of the proteins and calcium, as well as the splicing variation of p63 or p73. Our results outlining the complexity of the interaction should be considered when studying the functional effects of S100 proteins in their biological context."
https://openalex.org/W2088699189,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is frequently mutated in human tumors. It is thought that the p53 pathway is indirectly impaired in the remaining tumors, for example by overexpression of its important regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4, making them attractive targets for the development of anti-cancer agents. Recent studies have suggested that Mdm4 levels determine the sensitivity of tumor cells for anti-cancer therapy. To investigate this possibility, we studied the drug sensitivity of several breast cancer cell lines containing wild-type p53, but expressing different Mdm4 levels. We show that endogenous Mdm4 levels can affect the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to anti-cancer agents, but in a cell line-dependent manner and depending on an intact apoptotic response. Furthermore, treatment with the non-genotoxic agent Nutlin-3 sensitizes cells for doxorubicin, showing that activation of p53 by targeting its regulators is an efficient strategy to decrease cell viability of breast cancer cells. These results confirm a function of Mdm4 in determining the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis of cancer cells in a p53-dependent manner, although additional undetermined factors also influence the drug response. Targeting Mdm4 to sensitize tumor cells for chemotherapeutic drugs might be a strategy to effectively treat tumors harboring wild-type p53."

https://openalex.org/W2058850528,"Eukaryotes utilize fatty acids by beta-oxidation, which occurs in the mitochondria and peroxisomes in higher organisms and in the peroxisomes in yeast. The AMP-activated protein kinase regulates this process in mammalian cells, and its homolog Snf1, together with the transcription factors Adr1, Oaf1, and Pip2, regulates peroxisome proliferation and beta-oxidation in yeast. A constitutive allele of Adr1 (Adr1(c)) lacking the glucose- and Snf1-regulated phosphorylation substrate Ser-230 was found to be Snf1-independent for regulation of peroxisomal genes. In addition, it could compensate for and even suppress the requirement for Oaf1 or Pip2 for gene induction. Peroxisomal genes were found to be regulated by oleate in the presence of glucose, as long as Adr1(c) was expressed, suggesting that the Oaf1/Pip2 heterodimer is Snf1-independent. Consistent with this observation, Oaf1 binding to promoters in the presence of oleate was not reduced in a snf1Delta strain. Exploring the mechanism by which Adr1(c) permits Snf1-independent peroxisomal gene induction, we found that strength of promoter binding did not correlate with transcription, suggesting that stable binding is not a prerequisite for enhanced transcription. Instead, enhanced transcriptional activation and suppression of Oaf1, Pip2, and Snf1 by Adr1(c) may be related to the ability of Adr1(c) to suppress the requirement for and enhance the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators in a promoter- and growth medium-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2132228009,"Background Chronic transplant dysfunction explains the majority of late renal allograft loss and is accompanied by extensive tissue remodeling leading to transplant vasculopathy, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Matrix proteoglycans mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and play key roles in tissue remodeling. The aim of this study was to characterize differential heparan sulfate proteoglycan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression in transplant vasculopathy, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in renal allografts with chronic transplant dysfunction. Methods Renal allografts were transplanted in the Dark Agouti-to-Wistar Furth rat strain combination. Dark Agouti-to-Dark Agouti isografts and non-transplanted Dark Agouti kidneys served as controls. Allograft and isograft recipients were sacrificed 66 and 81 days (mean) after transplantation, respectively. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (collXVIII, perlecan and agrin) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (versican) expression, as well as CD31 and LYVE-1 (vascular and lymphatic endothelium, respectively) expression were (semi-) quantitatively analyzed using immunofluorescence. Findings Arteries with transplant vasculopathy and sclerotic glomeruli in allografts displayed pronounced neo-expression of collXVIII and perlecan. In contrast, in interstitial fibrosis expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan versican dominated. In the cortical tubular basement membranes in both iso- and allografts, induction of collXVIII was detected. Allografts presented extensive lymphangiogenesis (p<0.01 compared to isografts and non-transplanted controls), which was associated with induced perlecan expression underneath the lymphatic endothelium (p<0.05 and p<0.01 compared to isografts and non-transplanted controls, respectively). Both the magnitude of lymphangiogenesis and perlecan expression correlated with severity of interstitial fibrosis and impaired graft function. Interpretation Our results reveal that changes in the extent of expression and the type of proteoglycans being expressed are tightly associated with tissue remodeling after renal transplantation. Therefore, proteoglycans might be potential targets for clinical intervention in renal chronic transplant dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2081713084,"Vav proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases that regulate cell adhesion, motility, spreading and proliferation in response to growth factor signalling. In this work, we show that Vav2 expression delayed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization and degradation, and enhanced EGFR, ERK and Akt phosphorylations. This effect of Vav2 on EGFR degradation is dependent on its guanine nucleotide exchange function. Knockdown of Vav2 in HeLa cells enhanced EGFR degradation and reduced cell proliferation. epidermal growth factor stimulation led to co-localization of Vav2 with EGFR and Rab5 in endosomes. We further show that the effect of Vav2 on EGFR stability is modulated by its interaction with two endosome-associated proteins and require RhoA function. Thus, in this work, we report for the first time that Vav2 can regulate growth factors receptor signalling by slowing receptor internalization and degradation through its interaction with endosome-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060002736,"Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) methylation is a histone modification that has been demonstrated to function in transcriptional elongation by recruiting the Rpd3S histone deacetylase complex to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. Recently, we identified a trans-histone pathway in which the interaction between the N terminus of Set2 and histone H4 Lys(44) is needed to mediate trans-histone H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation. In the current study, we demonstrate that mutation of the lysine 44 residue in histone H4 or the Set2 mutant lacking the histone H4 interaction motif leads to intragenic cryptic transcripts, indicating that the Set2 and histone H4 interaction is important to repress intragenic cryptic transcription. We also determine that histone H2A residues (Leu(116) and Leu(117)), which are in close proximity to histone H4 Lys(44), are needed for proper trans-histone H3 Lys(36) methylation. Similar to H4 Lys(44) mutants, histone H2A Leu(116) and Leu(117) mutations exhibited decreased H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation, increased histone H4 acetylation, increased resistance to 6-azauracil, and cryptic transcription. Interestingly, the combined histone H4 Lys(44) and H2A mutations have more severe methylation defects and increased H4 acetylation levels. Furthermore, we identify that additional histone H2A and H3 core residues are also needed for H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation. Overall, our results show and suggest that multiple H4, H2A, and H3 residues contribute to and form a Set2 docking/recognition site on the nucleosomal surface so that proper Set2-mediated H3 Lys(36) di- and trimethylation, histone acetylation, and transcriptional elongation can occur."
https://openalex.org/W2025427356,"Background Fas, a member of the tumor necrosis family, is responsible for initiating the apoptotic pathway when bound to its ligand, Fas-L. Defects in the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway have been reported in colorectal cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, a variant of the ApcMin/+ mouse, a model for the human condition, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), was generated with an additional deficiency of Fas (ApcMin/+/Faslpr) by cross-breeding ApcMin/+ mice with Fas deficient (Faslpr) mice. One of the main limitations of the ApcMin/+ mouse model is that it only develops benign polyps. However, ApcMin/+/Faslpr mice presented with a dramatic increase in tumor burden relative to ApcMin/+ mice and invasive lesions at advanced ages. Proliferation and apoptosis markers revealed an increase in cellular proliferation, but negligible changes in apoptosis, while p53 increased at early ages. Fas-L was lower in ApcMin/+/Faslpr mice relative to ApcMin/+ cohorts, which resulted in enhanced inflammation. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrated that imposition of a Fas deletion in an ApcMin/+ background results in a more aggressive phenotype of the ApcMin/+ mouse model, with more rapid development of invasive intestinal tumors and a decrease in Fas-L levels."
https://openalex.org/W2012175414,"The BCL-2 family of proteins includes pro- and antiapoptotic members acting by controlling the permeabilization of mitochondria. Although the association of these proteins with the outer mitochondrial membrane is crucial for their function, little is known about the characteristics of this interaction.Here, we followed a reductionist approach to clarify to what extent membrane-active regions of homologous BCL-2 family proteins contribute to their functional divergence. Using isolated mitochondria as well as model lipid Langmuir monolayers coupled with Brewster Angle Microscopy, we explored systematically and comparatively the membrane activity and membrane-peptide interactions of fragments derived from the central helical hairpin of BAX, BCL-xL and BID. The results show a connection between the differing abilities of the assayed peptide fragments to contact, insert, destabilize and porate membranes and the activity of their cognate proteins in programmed cell death.BCL-2 family-derived pore-forming helices thus represent structurally analogous, but functionally dissimilar membrane domains."

Children aged 1-9 years and adults aged 15 and above were assessed for clinical signs of trachoma. In total, 1010 households in Chikwawa and 1016 households in Mchinji districts were enumerated within 108 clusters (54 clusters in each district). A total of 6,792 persons were examined for ocular signs of trachoma. The prevalence of trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) among children aged 1-9 years was 13.6% (CI 11.6-15.6) in Chikwawa and 21.7% (CI 19.5-23.9) in Mchinji districts respectively. The prevalence of trachoma trichiasis (TT) in women and men aged 15 years and above was 0.6% (CI 0.2-0.9) in Chikwawa and 0.3% (CI 0.04-0.6) in Mchinji respectively. The presence of a dirty face was significantly associated with trachoma follicular (TF) in both Chikwawa and Mchinji districts (P<0.001).Prevalence rates of trachoma follicles (TF) in Central and Southern Malawi exceeds the WHO guidelines for the intervention with mass antibiotic distribution (TF>10%), and warrants the trachoma SAFE control strategy to be undertaken in Chikwawa and Mchinji districts."
https://openalex.org/W2087270708,"The SCL (TAL1) transcription factor is a critical regulator of haematopoiesis and its expression is tightly controlled by multiple cis-acting regulatory elements. To elaborate further the DNA elements which control its regulation, we used genomic tiling microarrays covering 256 kb of the human SCL locus to perform a concerted analysis of chromatin structure and binding of regulatory proteins in human haematopoietic cell lines. This approach allowed us to characterise further or redefine known human SCL regulatory elements and led to the identification of six novel elements with putative regulatory function both up and downstream of the SCL gene. They bind a number of haematopoietic transcription factors (GATA1, E2A LMO2, SCL, LDB1), CTCF or components of the transcriptional machinery and are associated with relevant histone modifications, accessible chromatin and low nucleosomal density. Functional characterisation shows that these novel elements are able to enhance or repress SCL promoter activity, have endogenous promoter function or enhancer-blocking insulator function. Our analysis opens up several areas for further investigation and adds new layers of complexity to our understanding of the regulation of SCL expression."
https://openalex.org/W2108067412,"Background Different classes of unmyelinated nerve fibers appear to exhibit distinct conductive properties. We sought a criterion based on conduction properties for distinguishing sympathetic efferents and unmyelinated, primary afferents in peripheral nerves. Methodology/Principal Findings In anesthetized monkey, centrifugal or centripetal recordings were made from single unmyelinated nerve fibers in the peroneal or sural nerve, and electrical stimuli were applied to either the sciatic nerve or the cutaneous nerve endings, respectively. In centrifugal recordings, electrical stimulation at the sympathetic chain and dorsal root was used to determine the fiber's origin. In centrifugal recordings, sympathetic fibers exhibited absolute speeding of conduction to a single pair of electrical stimuli separated by 50 ms; the second action potential was conducted faster (0.61 0.16%) than the first unconditioned action potential. This was never observed in primary afferents. Following 2 Hz stimulation (3 min), activity-dependent slowing of conduction in the sympathetics (8.6 0.5%) was greater than in one afferent group (6.7 0.5%) but substantially less than in a second afferent group (29.4 1.9%). In centripetal recordings, most mechanically-insensitive fibers also exhibited absolute speeding to twin pulse stimulation. The subset that did not show this absolute speeding was responsive to chemical stimuli (histamine, capsaicin) and likely consists of mechanically-insensitive afferents. During repetitive twin pulse stimulation, mechanosensitive afferents developed speeding, and speeding in sympathetic fibers increased. Conclusions/Significance The presence of absolute speeding provides a criterion by which sympathetic efferents can be differentiated from primary afferents. The differences in conduction properties between sympathetics and afferents likely reflect differential expression of voltage-sensitive ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2067999997,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem that leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with as many as 2 million people predicted to need therapy worldwide by 2010. Obesity is a risk factor for CKD and leptin, the obesity hormone, correlates with body fat mass and markers of renal function. A number of clinical and experimental studies have suggested a link between serum leptin and kidney disease. We hypothesised that variants in the leptin gene (LEP) may be associated with markers of CKD in indigenous black Africans. Methodology/Principal Findings Black South Africans of Xhosa (distinct cultural Bantu-speaking population) descent were recruited for the study and four common polymorphisms of the LEP (rs7799039, rs791620, rs2167270 and STS-U43653 [ENSSNP5824596]) were analysed for genotype and haplotype association with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), Serum creatinine (Scr) and serum leptin level. In one of the four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we examined, an association with the renal phenotypes was observed. Hypertensive subjects with the T allele (CT genotype) of the ENSSNP5824596 SNP had a significantly higher eGFR (p = 0.0141), and significantly lower Scr (p = 0.0137). This was confirmed by haplotype analysis. Also, the haplotype GAAC had a modest effect on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in normotensive subjects (p = 0.0482). Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that genetic variations of the LEP may be associated with phenotypes that are markers of CKD in black Africans."
https://openalex.org/W2026778334,"The activin type II receptor (ACVR2) contains two identical microsatellites in exons 3 and 10, but only the exon 10 microsatellite is frameshifted in mismatch repair (MMR)-defective colonic tumors. The reason for this selectivity is not known. We hypothesized that ACVR2 frameshifts were influenced by DNA sequences surrounding the microsatellite. We constructed plasmids in which exons 3 or 10 of ACVR2 were cloned +1 bp out of frame of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), allowing –1 bp frameshift to express EGFP. Plasmids were stably transfected into MMR-deficient cells, and subsequent non-fluorescent cells were sorted, cultured and harvested for mutation analysis. We swapped DNA sequences flanking the exon 3 and 10 microsatellites to test our hypothesis. Native ACVR2 exon 3 and 10 microsatellites underwent heteroduplex formation (A7/T8) in hMLH1−/− cells, but only exon 10 microsatellites fully mutated (A7/T7) in both hMLH1−/− and hMSH6−/− backgrounds, showing selectivity for exon 10 frameshifts and inability of exon 3 heteroduplexes to fully mutate. Substituting nucleotides flanking the exon 3 microsatellite for nucleotides flanking the exon 10 microsatellite significantly reduced heteroduplex and full mutation in hMLH1−/− cells. When the exon 3 microsatellite was flanked by nucleotides normally surrounding the exon 10 microsatellite, fully mutant exon 3 frameshifts appeared. Mutation selectivity for ACVR2 lies partly with flanking nucleotides surrounding each microsatellite."
https://openalex.org/W2089903482,"Since the advent of highly pathogenic variants of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), the main focus of avian influenza research has been the characterization and detection of HPAIV hemagglutinin (HA) from H5 and H7 subtypes. However, due to the high mutation and reassortation rate of influenza viruses, in theory any influenza strain may acquire increased pathogenicity irrespective of its subtype. A comprehensive antigenic characterization of influenza viruses encompassing all 16 HA and 9 neuraminidase subtypes will provide information useful for the design of differential diagnostic tools, and possibly, vaccines. We have expressed recombinant HA proteins from 3 different influenza virus HA subtypes in the baculovirus system. These proteins were used to generate polyclonal rabbit antisera, which were subsequently employed in epitope scanning analysis using peptide libraries spanning the entire HA. Here, we report the identification and characterization of linear, HA subtype-specific as well as inter subtype-conserved epitopes along the HA proteins. Selected subtype-specific epitopes were shown to be suitable for the differentiation of anti-HA antibodies in an ELISA."

https://openalex.org/W1964492114,"Computational de novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites is still a challenging problem. The growing number of sequenced genomes allows integrating orthology evidence with coregulation information when searching for motifs. Moreover, the more advanced motif detection algorithms explicitly model the phylogenetic relatedness between the orthologous input sequences and thus should be well adapted towards using orthologous information. In this study, we evaluated the conditions under which complementing coregulation with orthologous information improves motif detection for the class of probabilistic motif detection algorithms with an explicit evolutionary model.We designed datasets (real and synthetic) covering different degrees of coregulation and orthologous information to test how well Phylogibbs and Phylogenetic sampler, as representatives of the motif detection algorithms with evolutionary model performed as compared to MEME, a more classical motif detection algorithm that treats orthologs independently.Under certain conditions detecting motifs in the combined coregulation-orthology space is indeed more efficient than using each space separately, but this is not always the case. Moreover, the difference in success rate between the advanced algorithms and MEME is still marginal. The success rate of motif detection depends on the complex interplay between the added information and the specificities of the applied algorithms. Insights in this relation provide information useful to both developers and users.

https://openalex.org/W1969550690,"Retroviral insertional mutagenesis provides an effective forward genetic method for identifying genes involved in essential cellular pathways. A Chinese hamster ovary cell line mutant resistant to several bacterial ADP-ribosylating was obtained by this approach. The toxins used catalyze ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF-2), block protein synthesis, and cause cell death. Strikingly, in the CHO PR328 mutant cells, the eEF-2 substrate of these ADP-ribosylating toxins was found to be modified, but the cells remained viable. A systematic study of these cells revealed the presence of a structural mutation in one allele of the eEF-2 gene. This mutation, Gly717Arg, is close to His715, the residue that is modified to become diphthamide. This Arg substitution prevents diphthamide biosynthesis at His715, rendering the mutated eEF-2 non-responsive to ADP-ribosylating toxins, while having no apparent effect on protein synthesis. Thus, CHO PR328 cells are heterozygous, having wild type and mutant eEF-2 alleles, with the latter allowing the cells to survive even in the presence of ADP-ribosylating toxins. Here, we report the comprehensive characterization of these cells."
