https://openalex.org/W2005574904,"The small GTP-binding protein rab5 was previously localized on early endosomes and on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Using a cell-free assay, we have now tested whether rab5 is involved in controlling an early endocytic fusion event. Fusion could be inhibited by cytosol containing the overexpressed mutant rab5lle133, which does not bind GTP on blots, and by antibodies against rab5, but not against rab2 or rab7. In contrast, fusion was stimulated with cytosol containing overexpressed wild-type rab5. Cytosols containing high levels of rab2 or mutant rab5 with the 9 carboxy-terminal amino acids deleted, which bind GTP on blots, had no effects. Finally, the inhibition mediated by anti-rab5 antibodies could be overcome by complementing the assay with the cytosol containing wild-type rab5, but not with the same cytosol depleted of rab5, nor with cytosol containing the rab5 mutants or rab2. These in vitro findings strongly suggest that rab5 is involved in the process of early endosome fusion."

Peripheral selection was found to be dependent on T cell receptor (TCR)-ligand interactions but to differ from thymic selection with regard to specificity and mechanism. Unlike thymic selection, peripheral selection required binding of antigen to the TCR, and it induced expansion of T cell clones. Tolerance to self antigens that are restricted to the periphery occurred through the elimination of self-reactive T cells and by the clonal anergy, which was associated with down-regulation of the alpha beta TCR and CD8."
https://openalex.org/W1969022737,"A binary system for gene activation and site-specific integration, based on the conditional recombination of transfected sequences mediated by the FLP recombinase from yeast, was implemented in mammalian cells. In several cell lines, FLP rapidly and precisely recombined copies of its specific target sequence to activate an otherwise silent β-galactosidase reporter gene. Clones of marked cells were generated by excisional recombination within a chromosomally integrated copy of the silent reporter. By the reverse reaction, integration of transfected DNA was targeted to a specific chromosomal site. The results suggest that FLP could be used to mosaically activate or inactivate transgenes for analysis of vertebrate development, and to efficiently integrate transfected DNA at predetermined chromosomal locations."
https://openalex.org/W1604748982,"We have identified two regions in the 5'-flanking sequence of the rat quinone reductase gene that contain xenobiotic responsive elements. The DNA sequence of the first region spans nucleotides -393 to -352 of the 5'-flanking region and shares sequence identity with the xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) described for the cytochrome P-450 CYPIA1 gene. The DNA sequence of the second region spans nucleotides -434 to -404 of the 5'-flanking region of the quinone reductase structural gene. When a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to nucleotides -434 to -404 was inserted in front of a heterologous promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene, an increase in basal level expression as well as responsiveness to beta-naphthoflavone and t-butylhydroquinone, but not 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, was observed. The sequence, -434 to -404, did not have any sequence identity with the XRE but shared a large degree of identity with the antioxidant responsive element recently described for the rat glutathione S-transferase Ya subunit gene (Rushmore, T. H., King, R. G., Paulson, K. E., and Pickett, C. B. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 3826-3830; Rushmore, T. H., and Pickett, C. B. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14648-14653). These results indicate that the antioxidant responsive element can be distinguished functionally from the classical XRE and is also involved in the regulation of the quinone reductase gene by planar aromatic compounds and phenolic antioxidants."

https://openalex.org/W1993624518,"Fos and Jun transcription factors are induced by a variety of extracellular signaling agents. We describe here an unusual member of the Fos family that is also induced, namely, a truncated form of FosB (ΔFosB) missing the C-terminal 101 amino acids of FosB. ΔFosB retains the dimerization and DNA-binding activities of FosB but has lost the ability in transfection assays to activate a promoter with an AP-1 site and to repress the c-fos promoter. Rather, ΔFosB inhibits gene activation by Jun or Jun + Fos and inhibits repression of the c-fos promoter by FosB or c-Fos, presumably by competing with full-length Fos proteins at the steps of dimerization with Jun and binding to DNA. In stimulated cells ΔFosB may act to limit the transcriptional effects of Fos and Jun proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2004458954,We describe functional simplified T cell and Fc receptor chimeras that are capable of directing CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to specifically recognize and lyse cells expressing HIV envelope proteins. Target cells bearing HLA-DR molecules are not recognized by CTL armed with the chimeras. The variety of cell types in which the native receptors are active suggests multiple possibilities for antiviral intervention through genetic means.
https://openalex.org/W1735646219,"Action of purified human cathepsin B on recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA) generated enzymatically active two-chain uPA (HMW-uPA), which was indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot from plasmin-generated HMW-uPA and from elastase- or thrombin-generated inactive two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Preincubation of cathepsin B with E-64 (transepoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamino- (4-guanidino)butane, a potent inhibitor for cathepsin B) prior to the addition of pro-uPA prevented the activation of pro-uPA. The cleavage site within the cathepsin B-treated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) molecule, determined by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, is located between Lys158 and Ile159. Pro-uPA is cleaved by cathepsin B at the same peptide bond that is cleaved by plasmin or kallikrein. Binding of cathepsin B-activated pro-uPA to the uPA receptor on U937 cells did not differ from that of enzymatically inactive pro-uPA, indicating an intact receptor-binding region within the growth factor-like domain of the cathepsin B-treated uPA molecule. Not only soluble but also tumor cell receptor-bound pro-uPA could be efficiently cleaved by cathepsin B to generate enzymatically active two-chain uPA. Thus, cathepsin B can substitute for plasmin in the proteolytic activation of pro-uPA to enzymatically active HMW-uPA. In contrast, no significant activation of pro-uPA by cathepsin D was observed. As tumor cells may produce both pro-uPA and cathepsin B, implications for the activation of tumor cell-derived pro-uPA by cellular proteases may be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1523056580,"Myristoylated recombinant proteins can be synthesized in Escherichia coli by concurrent expression of the enzyme myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyl-transferase with its protein substrates (Duronio, R.J., Jackson-Machelski, E., Heuckeroth, R.O., Olins, P. O., Devine, C.S., Yonemoto, W., Slice, L. W., Taylor, S. S., and Gordon, J. I. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 87, 1506-1510). Expression of the G protein subunit Goα in this system results in the synthesis of two forms of the protein; these were separated on a column of heptylamine-Sepharose. Purification of the more abundant form of Goα yielded a product that has a blocked amino terminus. Chemical analysis of the fatty acids released by acid hydrolysis of the protein revealed myristic acid. The second form of the protein was not myristoylated. Myristoylated and nonmyristoylated recombinant Goα were compared with brain Goα (which is myristoylated) for their ability to interact with G protein βγ subunits. The nonmyristoylated recombinant protein clearly had a reduced affinity for βγ, while the myristoylated recombinant protein was indistinguishable from native Goα in its subunit interactions. Thus, myristoylation increases the affinity of α subunits for βγ. We propose that the function of myristoylation of G protein α subunits is, at least in part, to facilitate formation of the heterotrimer and the localization of α to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1979837932,"Transcription factor AP-1 is inducible by phorbol esters and thus could be considered to be one final target of the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway. AP-1 consists of the products of the fos and jun oncogenes, which associate as dimers to bind TPA-responsive promoter elements (TRE) efficiently. We show that AP-1 activity is modulated by an inhibitory protein (IP-1), present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of several cell types. IP-1 specifically blocks DNA binding of AP-1 from nuclear extracts and of in vitro synthesized Fos/Jun proteins. It is a labile protein of 30–40 kd, which exerts its activity only in the nonphosphorylated form. Block of IP-1 function is obtained by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, possibly suggesting a cross talk mechanism at transcriptional level. Competition experiments with synthetic peptides suggest that IP-1 could interact with Fos and/or Jun leucine zippers. We speculate that IP-1 might act as a transcriptional antioncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2091986547,"Self-tolerance to a transgene-encoded protein, hen egg lysozyme, was examined in the T and B cell repertoires of a series of lines of transgenic mice that expressed different serum concentrations of soluble lysozyme. T cells were tolerant in all lines in which lysozyme was expressed irrespective of the antigen concentration, whereas B cell tolerance did not occur when the serum lysozyme concentration was less than 1.5 nanograms per milliliter (0.1 nM). Induction of elevated transgene expression could restore B cell tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that autoimmune disease may in some instances arise through a bypass of T cell tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2012120883,"Engagement of the antigen-specific receptor (TCR) of CD4+ T lymphocytes without a second (costimulatory) signal prevents the subsequent production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by these cells. Because IL-2 is a key immunoregulatory lymphokine and is also produced by a subset of CD8+ T cells that are able to kill target cells, the effect of engaging the TCR of one such clone in the absence of costimulatory signals was examined. The capacity for TCR-dependent IL-2 production was lost, indicating comparable costimulator-dependent signaling requirements for IL-2 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, TCR-mediated cytotoxicity was not impaired, implying that costimulation is required for only certain TCR-dependent effector functions."
https://openalex.org/W2031472565,"Drosophila males modulate the interpulse intervals produced during their courtship songs. These song cycles, which are altered by mutations in the clock gene period, exhibit a species-specific variation that facilitates mating. We have used chimeric period gene constructs from Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans in germline transformation experiments to map the genetic control of their song rhythm difference to a small segment of the amino acid encoding information within this gene."
https://openalex.org/W1548159321,"Sixty-four variants of human tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) were produced using recombinant DNA techniques. Charged residues were converted to alanine in clusters of from one to four changes per variant; these clusters spanned all the domains of the molecule. The variants were expressed by mammalian cells and were analyzed for a variety of properties. Variants of tPA were found that had reduced activity with respect to each tested property; in a few cases increased activity was observed. Analysis of these effects prompted the following conclusions: 1) charged residues in the nonprotease domains are less involved in fibrin stimulation of tPA activity than those in the protease domain, and it is possible to increase the fibrin specificity (i.e. the stimulation of tPA activity by fibrin compared to fibrinogen) by mutations at several sites in the protease domain; 2) the difference in enzymatic activity between the one- and two-chain forms of tPA can be increased by mutations at several sites on the protease domain; 3) binding of tPA to lysine-Sepharose was affected only by mutations to kringle-2, whereas binding to fibrin was affected most by mutations in the other domains; 4) clot lysis was influenced by mutations in all domains except kringle-2; 5) sensitivity to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 seems to reside exclusively in the region surrounding residue 300. A model of the tPA protease domain has been used to map some of the critical residues and regions."
https://openalex.org/W2026770882,"Serine 130 is one of seven residues that form a total of seven hydrogen bonds with the sulfate completely sequestered deep in the cleft between the two lobes of the bilobate sulfate-binding protein from Salmonella typhimurium. This residue has been replaced with Cys, Ala, and Gly by site-directed mutagenesis in an Escherichia coli expression system. Replacement with the isosteric Cys caused a 3200-fold decrease in the sulfate-binding activity relative to the wild-type activity, whereas replacement with Ala and Gly resulted in only 100- and 15-fold decreases, respectively. The effect of the Cys substitution is attributed largely to steric effect, whereas the Gly substitution more nearly reflects the loss of one hydrogen bond to the bound sulfate with a strength of only 1.6 kilocalories per mole."

https://openalex.org/W1516627538,"Prothymosin alpha is a highly acidic protein which lacks an amino-terminal signal peptide, yet was once thought to be a precursor for thymosin alpha 1, a putative peptide hormone secreted by the thymus. Here, two lines of evidence are presented that strongly implicate prothymosin alpha as a nuclear protein: 1) in COS cells transfected with the human prothymosin alpha gene copious amounts of prothymosin alpha were present in sealed nuclei obtained by treating these cells with cytochalasin B and enucleating them centrifugally. 2) Constructs in which human prothymosin alpha nucleic acid sequences were fused in-frame either near the amino terminus of the beta-galactosidase gene in pCH110 or at the carboxyl terminus, when expressed in COS cells, resulted in nuclear localization of the fusion protein; indirect immunofluorescence in situ was used as the assay. The basic cluster of amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of prothymosin alpha, TKKQKT, has been identified as part of the nuclear targeting signal, whereas the basic cluster of amino acids situated within the thymosin alpha 1 sequence at the amino terminus failed to effect nuclear transport."
https://openalex.org/W2069991602,"The achaete (ac) and scute (sc) genes of Drosophila allow cells to become sensory organ mother cells. Although ac and sc have similar patterns of expression, deletion of either gene removes specific subsets of sensory organs. This specificity was shown to reside in the peculiar regulation of ac and sc expression. These genes are first activated in complementary spatial domains in response to different cis-regulatory sequences. Each gene product then stimulates expression of the other gene, thus generating similar patterns of expression. Therefore, removal of one gene leads to the absence of both proneural gene products and sensory organs in the sites specified by its cis-regulatory sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1597231611,"DNase I footprinting analysis of the proximal apoA-I promoter sequences with rat liver nuclear extracts identified four protected regions: A, -22 to +17; B, -128 to -77; C, -175 to -148; and D, -220 to -190. Region D (-220 to -190) binds at least two distinct activities, designated AID1 and AID2, respectively, which can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Region C (-175 to -148) forms five DNA protein complexes. Three of the complexes (2, 4, and 5) originate from the binding of more than one heat-stable nuclear factor, and two (1 and 3), from the binding of two heat-labile factors. The heat-stable factors bind in the -175 to -148 region and can be distinguished from C/EBP, which recognizes the same region, with DNA binding gel electrophoretic assays. Both factors 1 and 3 bind in the -168 to -148 apoA-I region. Despite the lack of a CCAAT motif in this region, the binding of factor 1 is competed out by oligonucleotides containing the binding sites of NFY and NFY*. Mutagenesis of the promoter region showed that mutations in the -171 to -166 and -158 to -153 regions diminished the binding of the heat-stable factors and reduced hepatic transcription to 14 and 8% of control, respectively. In contrast, a mutation in the -164 to -159 region abolished the binding of factor 1 and was associated with a 4.6-fold increase in hepatic transcription. These findings suggest that the heat-stable factors act as positive regulators, whereas factor 1 acts as a negative regulator in apoA-I gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1517501247,"Abstract The guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), which play a central role in coupling membrane-bound receptors to intracellular effectors, are heterotrimers composed of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The beta and gamma subunits form a functional monomer that does not appear to separate under physiological conditions. This has made it difficult to differentiate the individual roles of beta and gamma subunits in signal transduction. To characterize the individual subunits, the 36-kDa beta subunit (beta 1), brain gamma (gamma 2), and transducin gamma (gamma t) were translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Hydrodynamic studies and tryptic proteolysis were used to compare the physical properties of the in vitro translation products with those of beta gamma dimers purified from bovine brain. The hydrodynamic studies indicate that, without gamma subunits, the beta subunits are not stable but tend to aggregate into high molecular weight complexes. When beta and gamma subunits were co-translated, stable beta gamma dimers formed that bound alpha 0 in a guanine nucleotide-dependent manner. The beta gamma dimers were less hydrophobic than those purified from bovine brain. This may reflect a lack of post-translational modification in the reticulocyte lysate or other differences between the in vitro translation products and the purified beta gamma. When beta and gamma were translated separately and then mixed, beta gamma dimers also formed. Analysis of in vitro translated beta gamma subunits will provide ways to assess the function of these subunits and to determine the structural requirements for beta gamma formation."
https://openalex.org/W2044736491,"In 1921 it was discovered that the sexual fate of Drosophila is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes. Only recently has it been found that the X chromosome to autosome (X:A) ratio is communicated in part by the dose of sisterless-b (sis-b), an X-linked genetic element located within the achaete-scute complex of genes involved in neurogenesis. In this report, the molecular nature of the primary sex determination signal and its relation to these proneural genes was determined by analysis of sis-b+ germline transformants. The sis-b+ function is confered by protein T4, a member of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors. Although T4 is shared by sis-b and scute-alpha, the regulatory regions of sis-b, which control T4 expression in sex determination, are both separable from and simpler than those of scute-alpha, which control T4 expression in neurogenesis. Dose-sensitive cooperative interactions in the assembly or binding of sis-dependent transcription factors may directly determine the activity of the female-specific promoter of Sex-lethal, the master regulator of sexual development. In this model there is no need to invoke the existence of analogous autosomal negative regulators of Sex-lethal."
https://openalex.org/W1497613461,"The catalytic (alpha) subunit of casein kinase II from Drosophila, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Saxena, A., Padmanabha, R., and Glover, C. V. C., (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 3409-3417), has been purified and characterized, and the properties have been compared to those of the holoenzyme. The catalytic subunit exhibits protein kinase activity with casein as substrate and is autophosphorylated. The specific activity of the purified subunit is 6% of the activity of the holoenzyme from reticulocytes or from Drosophila. The alpha subunit is a monomer, eluting at Mr = 40,000 upon gel filtration in high salt, but as part of an aggregate in low salt. The alpha subunit has been purified to apparent homogeneity by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Mono S, and Mono Q. A single band, Mr = 37,000, is detected by silver staining following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The isolated alpha subunit displays apparent Km values for beta casein, ATP, and GTP similar to those of the holoenzyme. The activity of the alpha subunit is inhibited by heparin with an I50 of 0.1-0.3 micrograms/ml, a value similar to that observed for the holoenzyme; autophosphorylation is also inhibited by heparin. Polylysine has no stimulatory effect on the activity of the catalytic subunit, as measured with casein and by autophosphorylation, but stimulates both activities with the holoenzyme. When physiological substrates for casein kinase II are examined, glycogen synthase and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) (p120) are phosphorylated by the alpha subunit at a rate equivalent to that of the holoenzyme, while phosphorylation of eIF-3 (p67) is reduced 9-fold and eIF-2 beta is not modified. From these data, it can be concluded that the alpha subunit of casein kinase II is sufficient for catalysis, is autophosphorylated, and can be directly inhibited by heparin, whereas the beta subunit mediates the effects of basic stimulatory compounds and is involved in recognition and/or binding to specific physiological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1527701197,"We have used a model system composed of tandem repeats of Lytechinus variegatus 5 S rDNA (Simpson, R. T., Thoma, F., and Brubaker, J. M. (1985) Cell 42, 799-808) reconstituted into chromatin with chicken erythrocyte core histones to investigate the mechanism of chromatin assembly. Nucleosomes are assembled onto the DNA template by mixing histone octamers and DNA in 2 M NaCl followed by stepwise dialysis into very low ionic strength buffer over a 24-h period. By 1.0 M NaCl, a defined intermediate composed of arrays of H3.H4 tetramers has formed, as shown by analytical and preparative ultracentrifugation. Digestion with methidium propyl EDTA.Fe(II) indicates that these tetramers are spaced at 207 base pair intervals, i.e. one/repeat length of the DNA positioning sequence. In 0.8 M NaCl, some H2A.H2B has become associated with the H3.H4 tetramers and DNA. Surprisingly, under these conditions DNA is protected from methidium propyl EDTA.Fe(II) digestion almost as well as in the complete nucleosome, even though these structures are quite deficient in H2A.H2B. By 0.6 M NaCl, nucleosome assembly is complete, and the MPE digestion pattern is indistinguishable from that observed for oligonucleosomes at very low ionic strength. Below 0.6 M NaCl, the oligonucleosomes are involved in various salt-dependent conformational equilibria: at approximately 0.6 M, a 15% reduction in S20,w that mimics a conformational change observed previously with nucleosome core particles; at and above 0.1 M, folding into a more compact structure(s); at and above 0.1 M NaCl, a reaction involving varying amounts of dissociation of histone octamers from a small fraction of the DNA templates. In low ionic strength buffer (less than 1 mM NaCl), oligonucleosomes are present as fully loaded templates in the extended beads-on-a-string structure."
https://openalex.org/W1580202025,"Resonance Raman spectroscopy has been used to probe the structure of the organic cofactor in copper-containing amine oxidases from bovine plasma, porcine kidney, pea seedlings, and the bacterium Arthrobacter P1. The enzymes were first derivatized with phenylhydrazine or p-nitrophenylhydrazine; resonance Raman spectra were obtained on the intact derivatized enzymes and on a derivatized active-site peptide isolated from bovine plasma amine oxidase. Spectra of the intact amine oxidase phenylhydrazones are practically identical, consistent with the enzymes examined containing a similar cofactor. Only minor frequency shifts and some intensity variations are detected between the resonance Raman spectra of intact bovine plasma amine oxidase and the isolated peptide. These spectral perturbations are attributable to differences in the micro-environment between the intact, folded protein and the isolated small peptide in aqueous solution. This rules out the possibility that a new structure is formed during the isolation of the derivatized active-site peptide. Importantly, the resonance Raman spectra of the phenylhydrazine and p-nitrophenylhydrazine derivatives of the bovine plasma amine oxidase peptide are identical to the spectra of the corresponding derivatives of topa quinone (6-hydroxydopa quinone). Hence these data provide strong, independent support for the recent identification of topa as the organic functional group in bovine plasma amine oxidase (Janes, S. M., Mu, D., Wemmer, D., Smith, A. J., Kaur, S., Maltby, D., Burlingame, A. L., and Klinman, J.P. (1990) Science 248, 981-987)."
https://openalex.org/W1567645629,"Induction of mitosis by certain growth factors is inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that the GTP-binding protein, Gi, is involved in receptor signal transduction to initiate cell division. However, the substrates of receptor-activated Gi that are involved in mitosis have not been determined. The present study has examined whether Gi may directly modulate cell division by receptor-induced subcellular translocation of the alpha subunit of Gi (Gi alpha). Insulin and EGF, particularly when added together or in combination with phorbol dibutyrate (PdBu), induced a rapid (1-4 h) redistribution of Gi alpha from the plasma membrane to perinuclear sites in the cell. After 2 days of stimulation, Gi alpha had translocated into the nucleus of dividing cells and bound specifically to the separating chromatin of dividing nuclei. Unstimulated cells did not display translocation of Gi alpha. This demonstrates a direct involvement of Gi alpha in cell division, which provides an apparently uninterrupted link from growth factor receptor to nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1535363306,"The soluble beta-galactoside-specific bovine lectin of subunit 14 kDa has been expressed in vitro by transcription and then translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The protein thus expressed shows the predicted binding to lactose coupled to Sepharose. Several mutants of the 134 amino acid protein have been expressed and insight gained into (a) the polypeptide length required to form the carbohydrate recognition domain and (b) the functional importance of some of the highly conserved amino acids. The following amino acids have been deleted: 1-9, 1-23, 88-122, 88-134, 107-134, or 124-134. In addition, a frame-shift mutant has been made in which the 23 amino acids at the C-terminal end were completely changed. Among these seven mutants only mutant 1-9 shows carbohydrate binding but with congruent to 30% of the activity of the wild-type protein (as assessed by the percentage of the protein bound to lactose-Sepharose). On the other hand, carbohydrate binding is relatively well preserved (75-90%) in mutant proteins where the C-terminal octapeptide sequence of the bovine lectin has been changed to sequences that resemble those in the chick 14-kDa lectin. When the single tryptophan at position 68 is changed by point mutagenesis to phenylalanine or to a leucine residue, a weak binding activity (congruent to 20%) is retained only with the former. When either of the cysteines 2 or 60 is changed to serine, binding activity is reduced to congruent to 60%, and when both are changed, to congruent to 20% of that for the wild-type protein. The susceptibility of the lectin to oxidative inactivation is unaffected when these 2 cysteines and cysteine 130 are changed to serine individually or in tandem (cysteines 2 and 60). In a second approach we show that the natural protein isolated from bovine heart is protected from proteolysis by trypsin and V8-protease in the presence of saccharide ligand. Although further work is required to identify residues which come into contact with the carbohydrate ligand, these results indicate that almost the complete polypeptide chain is necessary for the integrity of the carbohydrate recognition domain."
https://openalex.org/W2016823281,"We have constructed a chimeric toxin composed of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) and the extracellular ribonuclease of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, barnase. The chimeric protein, termed PE-Bar, reacted with both anti-PE and anti-barnase antisera and had both ADP ribosylation and ribonuclease activities. The chimeric toxin was cytotoxic to the murine fibroblast cell line L929 and to a murine hybridoma resistant to PE. A mutant form of PE-Bar lacking ADP-ribosylating activity was still cytotoxic to L929 cells. Because treatment of cells prelabeld with [3H]uridine resulted in a decrease in their RNA content, we conclude that this cytotoxic effect was due to the ribonuclease activity of barnase molecules that had been translocated to the cytosol. It is now possible to construct chimeric toxins with two or more enzymatic activities that can be delivered to the cytosol of the target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1589819858,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates the growth and differentiation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells by activating transcription of specific genes. The mechanism by which binding of GM-CSF to its receptor stimulates gene expression remains unknown. To examine this process in more detail, we have transfected human monocytic leukemia cells U937 with a plasmid containing an AP-1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase recorder gene and treated them with GM-CSF. We find that GM-CSF stimulates a 2-3-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity over a concentration range 1-1,000 units/ml. Northern and Western blot analysis demonstrates that the mechanism by which GM-CSF stimulates AP-1 enhancer activity involves increases in c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels, and increases in Jun protein. In a similar fashion the treatment of normal human monocytes with GM-CSF also induced increases in total cellular c-jun. Because protein kinase C plays a crucial role in activating c-jun transcription we examined the role of this enzyme in mediating the effects of GM-CSF. Treatment of U937 cells with inhibitors of protein kinase C including staurosporine 10 nM and H-7 50 microM, or down-regulation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester pretreatment blocks the induction of c-jun by GM-CSF. However, HA which does not block protein kinase C had no effect on GM-CSF stimulation of c-jun RNA levels. In addition, GM-CSF treatment causes the rapid translocation of protein kinase C to the particulate fraction which was maximal by 5 min and returned to base line by 80 min. These data suggest that the binding of GM-CSF to its receptor stimulates increases in c-jun mRNA and protein and activates AP-1 enhancer activity. These effects may be at least in part mediated by activation of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1648445627,"Increased synthesis of so-called glucose-regulated proteins (grp) of 78 and 94 kDa occurs in mammalian cells exposed to a variety of agents, including 2-mercaptoethanol, tunicamycin, agents which perturb calcium homeostasis, and amino acid analogs. Herein we describe a number of properties of 94-kDa grp (grp 94) and present a method for its purification to homogeneity. The protein, within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is modified by the addition of high mannose-containing oligosaccharides. The predicted amino acid sequence of grp 94, as determined by others, has revealed the protein to contain a putative transmembrane domain near its amino terminus, but in addition, a potential endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence (KDEL) at its COOH terminus. Consequently, the question of whether grp 94 exists as a transmembrane or luminal protein of the ER remains controversial. Results using isolated microsomes subjected to either limited proteolysis or lactoperoxidase-mediated iodination were consistent with the idea that the grp is a transmembrane protein. On the other hand, using the method of sodium carbonate extraction, grp 94 exhibited properties of both a luminal and integral membrane protein. These results raise the question of whether there exist two different forms of grp 94 within the ER."
https://openalex.org/W47146608,"Noncyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid may be potent modulators of the mitogenic response of renal mesangial cells to the mitogenic vasoactive peptide arginine vasopressin (AVP). Since Ca2+ is a critical second messenger in the response of mesangial cells to AVP, and Ca2+ has been implicated in the regulation of growth, we determined whether noncyclooxygenase metabolites altered the phospholipase C-Ca2+ signalling cascade which is activated by AVP. Pretreatment of mesangial cells for 10 min with lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase inhibitors, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, 10(-5) M) or SKF-525A (2.5 x 10(-5) M), but not the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (2 x 10(-5) M), reduced the magnitude of the AVP (10(-8) and 10(-7) M)-induced increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) without affecting inositol trisphosphate production. With 10(-8) M AVP, [Ca2+]i increased to 250 +/- 47 nM in NDGA-treated cells versus 401 +/- 59 nM in control cells (p less than 0.01). [Ca2+]i, measured 2 min after exposure to AVP, was also lower with NDGA (152 +/- 21 nM) when compared with AVP alone (220 +/- 22 nM, p less than 0.01). 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) (10(-8) M), which had no effect on inositol trisphosphate production, completely reversed the NDGA-induced inhibition of the [Ca2+]i transient, whereas 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE) (5 x 10(-7) M) did not. Pretreatment with higher concentrations of 14,15-EET (10(-7)-10(-6) M) markedly potentiated the AVP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. NDGA-induced inhibition of the AVP-generated [Ca2+]i transient was also observed when cells were incubated in low Ca2+ media ([Ca2+] less than 5 x 10(-8) M), suggesting that NDGA pretreatment impaired intracellular release of Ca2+. Since NDGA had no direct effect on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release, we postulated that NDGA blocked production of a metabolite that releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores. 14,15-EET and 15-HPETE, but not 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (each at 3 x 10(-7) M), raised [Ca2+]i when added directly to cells in low Ca2+ media. In permeabilized cells 14,15-EET and 15-HPETE (10(-7) M) potently released Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In summary, noncyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid, and in particular P450 metabolites, are potent endogenous amplifiers of the AVP-induced [Ca2+]i signal by mechanisms not directly involving phospholipase C activation. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites by an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1534432924,"Abstract A self-association reaction involving the plasma membrane-associated clathrin assembly protein AP-2 has been detected by incubating AP-2 alone under solution conditions that would favor the assembly of complete coat structures if clathrin were present. Self-association was rapid, unaffected by nonionic detergents, readily reversible, and gave rise to sedimentable aggregates. Only the AP subtype AP-2 exhibited self-association: the structurally or functionally related assembly proteins AP-1 and AP-3 and unrelated proteins neither self-associated nor were incorporated into the AP-2 aggregate. AP-2 interactions responsible for self-association were of high affinity, with an apparent Kd of approximately 10(-8)M. By proteolytic dissection, the self-association domain was localized to the core of the molecule containing the intact 50- and 16-kDa polypeptides in association with the truncated 60-66-kDa moieties of the parent alpha/beta polypeptides. Self-association of the intact AP-2 molecule was pH-dependent, exhibiting an apparent pKa approximately 7.4. While it is unlikely that the large AP-2 aggregates formed in solution are themselves biologically relevant structures, the AP-2 interactions involved in their formation have properties consistent with their occurrence in intact cells and thus may be important in cellular functions of the plasma membrane-localized assembly protein."
https://openalex.org/W1482932073,"Coenzyme analogs in which the D-ribose moiety of the nucleotide loop was replaced by an oligomethylene group and a trimethylene analog containing imidazole instead of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole were synthesized. Coordination of the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole to the cobalt atom in these analogs was much weaker than that in cobalamins. The replacement of this base with imidazole did not significantly alter the strength of the coordination to the cobalt atom. 5,6-Dimethylbenzimidazolyl trimethylene and tetramethylene and imidazolyl trimethylene analogs were partially active as coenzymes in the diol dehydrase reaction in this order as judged by kcat, but the others were not active as coenzymes and were weak competitive inhibitors. This indicates that neither the alpha-D-ribofuranose ring nor the functional groups of the ribose moiety are essential for coenzymic function. There was an optimum loop size of the analogs for catalysis and for tight binding to the apoenzyme, which corresponds to the loop size of cobalamins. Therefore, the D-ribose moiety seems important as a spacer to keep the base in the proper position. The reaction with the imidazolyl trimethylene analog as coenzyme was accompanied with concomitant rapid inactivation during catalysis. The inactivation occurred only in the presence of substrate. Upon inactivation with this analog, 5'-deoxyadenosine and a B12r-like species were formed from the adenosyl group and the rest of the analog molecule, respectively, without modification of the apoenzyme. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is a kind of suicide inactivation which occurred from one of the intermediates in the normal catalytic process. The dimethylbenzo moiety of the regular coenzyme thus seems to play an important role in preventing the intermediate complexes from inactivation during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1553561420,"In the high resolution (1.7-1.9 A) crystal structures of ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) in complex with guanosine, guanosine 2'-phosphate, guanylyl 2',5'-guanosine, and vanadate, there are 30 water sites in nearly identical (+/- 1 A) positions that are considered conserved. One water is tightly bound to Asp76(O delta), Thr93(O gamma), Cys6(O), and Asn9(N); another bridges two loops by hydrogen-bonding to Tyr68(O eta) and to Ser35(N), Asn36(N); a loop structure is stabilized by two waters coordinated to Gly31(O) and His27(N delta), and by water bound to cis-Pro39(O). Most notable is a hydrogen-bonded chain of 10 water molecules. Waters 1-5 of this chain are inaccessible to solvent, are anchored at Trp59(N), and stitch together the loop formed by segments 60-68; waters 5-8 coordinate to Ca2+, and waters 9 and 10 hydrogen-bond to N-terminal side chains of the alpha-helix. The water chain and two conserved water molecules are bound to amino acids adjacent to the active site residues His40, Glu58, Arg77, and His92; they are probably involved in maintaining their spatial orientation required for catalysis. Water sites must be considered in genetic engineering; the mutation Trp59Tyr, which probably influences the 10-water chain, doubles the catalytic activity of RNase T1."
https://openalex.org/W1586196888,"The beta-galactosidases of several mutagenized strains of Escherichia coli K12 which grew on lactobionate were found to be heat labile. Sequence analysis of the lacZ gene (ligated into Bluescript) of one of these strains (E. coli REH4) showed that the only change in the amino acid sequence was a substitution of an Asp for Gly-794. This change caused a dramatic increase of the activity when lactose was the substrate. The kcat of the purified enzyme from E. coli REH4 (G794D-beta-galactosidase) with lactose as the substrate was five to six times as large as the kcat of the normal enzyme with lactose. Purified G794D-beta-galactosidase was, however, less stable to heat and also to chymotrypsin (which cleaves next to Trp-585) than was normal beta-galactosidase. G794D-beta-Galactosidase bound substrates and substrate analog inhibitors less well than did normal beta-galactosidase while planar transition state analog inhibitors were more strongly bound. The ability to bind 2-amino-D-galactose (a positively charged transition state analog inhibitor) was either unaltered or was decreased somewhat. The data showed that the alteration in structure caused an increase in the value of k2 (the rate constant for the step in which the glycosidic bond is cleaved) with each substrate tested (the increase was at least 25-fold when lactose was the substrate) while k3 was decreased about 4-fold (k3 is the rate constant for the common hydrolysis step with each substrate). Since k2 is rate determining when lactose is the substrate of the normal enzyme, the increase in k2 resulted in a large increase in rate despite the fact that the value of k3 decreased. Large rate increases were not found with the other two substrates because the k2 values were not increased by large factors and because the decrease in the value of k3 negated the effects of the increased k2 values. The destabilization of the substrate binding coupled with a stabilization of the binding of a planar transition state is a possible cause of the significant increase in the value of k2 and of the enhanced activity with lactose."
https://openalex.org/W2414920586,"Carboxyl methylation of platelet ras-related proteins, known as rap proteins, was investigated in this study. Platelet membrane proteins of Mr 23,000 incorporated radioactivity in the presence of S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine and platelet cytosol. About 97% of the radioactivity present in the Mr 23,000 proteins was liberated as volatile methanol under basic (1 M sodium hydroxide) conditions. Cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, inhibited incorporation of S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine by 25%. These results suggest that at least 75% of the radioactivity present in the Mr 23,000 proteins is due to carboxyl methylation and not due to the incorporation of S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine into proteins or due to the incorporation of base-stable methyl groups into side chains of arginine, histidine, or lysine residues. Protein methylation did not occur if membranes or cytosol alone was incubated with S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine. Guanosine 5'(3-O-thio)triphosphate increased methylation of the Mr 23,000 proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Acetyl-farnesylcysteine, a synthetic substrate for carboxyl methyltransferases, completely blocked methylation of the Mr 23,000 membrane proteins. On the basis of one- and two-dimensional Western blots using rap-specific antisera, the Mr 23,000 methylated proteins were identified as rap1 proteins. The existence of the carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif in rap1 proteins, similar to the CAAX motif present in p21ras as well as in the yeast mating factors, leads us to suggest that methylation of rap1 proteins possibly occurs at the alpha-carboxyl-terminal cysteine."
https://openalex.org/W1514500225,"Synapsin I is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein localized on the surface of small synaptic vesicles to which it binds with high affinity (Kd = 10 nM). Synapsin I exhibits a tendency to self-associate, suggesting that it might have amphiphilic properties. We have now found that synapsin I forms a stable monolayer at an air-water interface which can be compressed under a lateral force of up to 60 dynes/cm, indicating the presence of amphiphilic characteristics in its structure. This interpretation was also supported by circular dichroism spectra of synapsin I, which showed induction of secondary structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol. The various phosphorylated forms of synapsin I did not show any noticeable differences in the force-area isotherms. The monolayer properties of synapsin I fragments derived by cysteine-specific cleavage indicated the presence of amphiphilic characteristics throughout the entire sequence, although the C-terminal region showed less of such surfactant properties. Compositional studies of these fragments revealed that there is little interaction between the N-terminal and middle fragment regions, but that there may be some interaction between the C-terminal and middle fragment regions which affects the surface area occupied by these fragments. Based on this information, we propose a molecular topology for synapsin I consisting of amphiphilic regions and a hydrophilic region."
https://openalex.org/W1495590980,"A novel glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-1) has been detected in embryonic chicken brains. This enzyme catalyzes the biosynthesis in vitro of glucuronic acid containing glycolipids starting from neolactotetraosylceramide (nLcOse4Cer) and neolactohexaosylceramide (nLcOse6Cer). The activity is present primarily in the Golgi-rich membrane fraction and can be extracted (60%) from the membrane using a neutral detergent, Nonidet P-40, at pH 7.0. The detergent-solubilized GlcAT-1 is stable (70%) at -20 degrees C for at least 4 months. Both membrane-bound GlcAT-1 and solubilized GlcAT-1 show similar pH optima, 6.5-7.0, in HEPES buffer. The Km values were 15 and 200 microM with UDP-[14C] GlcA and nLcOse4Cer, respectively, when the detergent-solubilized supernatant fraction was used as enzyme source. The purified 14C radioactive product that comigrated with chemically characterized GlcA beta 1-3nLcOse4Cer (GlcA-nLc4) also yielded a positive immunostain with monoclonal antibody (human IgM-RI). The anomeric linkage was established as beta-linked GlcA to the terminal galactose of the substrate, as evidenced by 90-99% cleavage of the terminal [14C] GlcA by purified Helix pomatia and limpet glucuronidases. Permethylation studies of the radioactive product obtained from [6-3H]Gal beta 1-4LcOse3Cer and non-radioactive UDP-GlcA showed the presence of 2,4,6-tri-O-methylgalactose in the hydrolyzed enzymatic product. These studies established the structure of the biosynthesized product from nLcOse4Cer as GlcA beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4 GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc-ceramide."
https://openalex.org/W1553327141,"The covalent modification of proteins by isoprenoid derivatives of mevalonic acid was investigated in human platelets, cells that lack the ability to synthesize endogenous cholesterol, and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, cholesterol-producing cultured cells derived from megakaryocytes. When washed platelets or HEL cells were incubated with [3H]mevalonic acid, the radiolabel was incorporated into a distinct group of proteins with molecular masses between 21,000 and 28,000. We have identified one of these proteins as a ras-related rap2 protein based on its immunoreactivity with a polyclonal antiserum raised against purified recombinant rap2b. This anti-rap2 antiserum was used for two-dimensional immunoblotting analysis and immunoprecipitation of mevalonate-labeled rap2 from platelets and HEL cells. These results suggest that rap2 may undergo a series of carboxyl-terminal modifications similar to the p21ras proteins. In addition, it is shown that non-cholesterol-producing cells are capable of incorporating isoprenyl groups into specific proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1552833701,"The reaction between plasminogen activators and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 is characterized by an initial rapid formation of an inactive reversible complex. The second-order association rate constant (k1) of complex formation of recombinant two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or recombinant two-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rtcu-PA) by recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (rPAI-1) is 2.9 +/- 0.4 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 (mean +/- S.D., n = 30) and 2.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 (n = 12), respectively. Different molecular forms of tissue- or urokinase-type plasminogen activator which do not form covalent complexes with rPAI-1, including rt-PA-Ala478 (rt-PA with the active-site Ser478 mutagenized to Ala) and anhydro-urokinase (rtcu-PA with the active-site Ser356 converted to dehydroalanine) reduced k1 in a concentration-dependent manner, compatible with 1:1 stoichiometric complex formation between rPAI-1 and these ligands. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) of the complex between rPAI-1 and rt-PA-Ala478, determined as the concentration of rt-PA-Ala478 which reduced k1 to 50% of its control value, was 3-5 nM. Corresponding concentrations of active-site-blocked two-chain rt-PA were 150-250-fold higher. The concentration of anhydro-urokinase which reduced k1 to 50% was 4-6 nM, whereas that of active-site-blocked rtcu-PA was 100-250-fold higher. Recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator had an apparent KD of about 2 microM. These results suggest that inhibition of rt-PA or rtcu-PA by rPAI-1 proceeds via a reversible high affinity interaction which does not require a functional active site but which is markedly reduced following inactivation of the enzymes with active-site titrants."
https://openalex.org/W1552255706,"A fraction separated from rat submandibular gland homogenates was found to contain a potent vasoconstrictor when tested on isolated rabbit aortic rings. The vasoconstrictor was purified by a series of chromatographic steps. The purified compound (2.77 x 10(-9) M) induced 40% of the maximum contractile response to 60 mM KCl. Constriction was slow in onset, long-lasting, rinse-resistant, and unchanged by de-endothelialization; in addition, it was dose-related and inhibited by both EGTA and verapamil, but it was not affected by DUP753, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. The compound was found to be a protein having a pI of 7.36 and a molecular weight of approximately 29,000 and exhibiting partial immunologic identity to rat glandular kallikrein and rat tonin. After 2-mercaptoethanol treatment, it separated into heavy (approximately 19,900) and light (approximately 10,700) chains having amino-terminal sequences of AY(X)HNNDLMLL and VVGGYN(X)ETNSQ, respectively. We found that they correspond to the amino-terminal and internal sequence of a previously unidentified kallikrein-like serine protease whose mRNA, named S3, has been found in the rat submandibular gland and prostate. The vasoconstrictor is able to hydrolyze t-butoxycarbonyl-valine-proline-arginine-methylcoumarin amide (a thrombin substrate), although its Kcat/Km was only 0.02% that of rat thrombin. Both vasoconstrictor and enzymatic activity on t-butoxycarbonyl-valine-proline-arginine-methylcoumarin amide were completely suppressed by amidinophenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and soybean trypsin inhibitor; however, they were unaffected by hirudin, a thrombin inhibitor. At pH 6.5, it released angiotensin II when incubated with sheep angiotensinogen, although it had approximately one-tenth the activity of tonin. The submandibular enzymatic vasoconstrictor is a kallikrein-like enzyme, having some properties of both tonin and thrombin. It directly contracts vascular smooth muscle, acting via a mechanism that requires intact enzymatic activity."

https://openalex.org/W1575514705,"The effects of cholesterol on the activity and thermal properties of a pure, delipidated isoform of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were examined after incorporation of enzyme into unilamellar bilayers of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) or dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Cholesterol, in bilayers of DSPC, decreased enzyme activity and lowered the temperature (from 37 to 30 degrees C) for a reversible transition from the active form of the enzyme to a less active form. These effects could be separated from each other in that the effect on reversible inactivation of the enzyme occurred at lower concentrations of cholesterol than the effect on activity of the active form of the enzyme. In addition, cholesterol in bilayers of DSPC stabilized UDP-glucuronosyltransferase against irreversible thermal inactivation. The extent of stabilization increased with increasing concentration of cholesterol in the bilayers. The effects of cholesterol on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase depended, however, on the nature of the bilayer containing cholesterol. Cholesterol had small effects, if any, on the properties of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in bilayers of DOPC."
https://openalex.org/W35037724,"Abstract Polyclonal antisera were generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to distinct regions of the 1 protein sequences. A rap 1-common antiserum, prepared against an 18-amino acid segment of the 1a protein near the proposed GTP-binding region, reacted with both 1a and 1b recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and with two low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of 22 and 24 kDa in unstimulated human platelets. An antiserum raised against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of 1b containing the putative site of post-translational processing reacted strongly with bacterial-expressed recombinant 1b and with a 24-kDa GTP-binding protein in platelets, but not with recombinant 1a or a 22-kDa GTP-binding protein. The mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this 1b immunoreactive protein coincided with that of bacterial-expressed 1b and not with the faster migrating form of 1b that incorporates radioactivity from [3H]mevalonic acid in the insect/baculovirus system. This suggests that our 1b-specific antiserum recognizes only one form of 1b, that which has not undergone carboxyl-terminal post-translational processing."
https://openalex.org/W1483631853,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown to confluence, as first passage cells, on coverslips. Treatment with ionomycin or histamine caused a sustained rise in intracellular Ca2+ (measured by Fura-2 fluorescence), but after treatment with thrombin, only a transient rise in Ca2+ was observed. Furthermore, the addition of thrombin after ionomycin or histamine lowered the raised Ca2+ back to near control levels. This effect of thrombin was concentration dependent, with increasing concentrations producing increases in both the rate and extent of the lowering of Ca2+. A similar effect of thrombin was seen on video imaging of Fura-2-loaded cell monolayers. The Ca2(+)-lowering effect of thrombin was not mimicked by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate nor blocked by staurosporine, indicating a lack of involvement of protein kinase C; intracellular pH also does not appear to be involved. The mechanism by which thrombin lowers cytoplasmic Ca2+ is due mainly to inhibition of Ca2+ entry since thrombin prevented the stimulated influx of Mn2+ caused by histamine or ionomycin. It may therefore be that in vivo under certain physiological or pathological conditions, thrombin's effects on intracellular Ca2+ are more transient than those of histamine, and thrombin also may induce transience in histamine's actions."

https://openalex.org/W1560501087,"Abstract Translocation of the alpha subunit of Gi2 from the membrane to the cytosol was studied in mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells. To monitor Gi2 alpha the membrane (300,000 x g pellet) was [32P]ADP-ribosylated with pertussis toxin. Incubation of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated membrane with guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) caused a small release (10%) of [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gi2 alpha from the membrane. Whereas cytosol (300,000 x g supernatant) alone had no ability to release the [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gi2 alpha from the membrane, it markedly augmented the release induced by GTP gamma S, about 50% of the total [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gi2 alpha being released by 30 min. The GTP gamma S-induced release and its enhancement by the cytosol were specific for GTP and GTP gamma S. When the cytosol was boiled this promoting activity was lost. The [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gi2 alpha released by the cytosol plus GTP gamma S from the membrane was eluted as a single peak corresponding to a molecular weight of about 100,000 from an Ultrogel AcA 44 column. In contrast, the [32P]ADP-ribosylated Gi2 alpha released by GTP gamma S alone was eluted at the position of Mr = 40,000, but it was eluted at the position of Mr = about 100,000 when it was incubated with the cytosol. Furthermore, Gi2 alpha purified from bovine lung also behaved in a similar way on gel filtration. The addition of thrombin, a stimulant of histamine secretion from mast cells, to mastocytoma cells drastically induced the translocation of Gi2 alpha from the membrane to the cytosol in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. These results taken together demonstrate that the cytosol contains some factor(s) that promotes the release of GTP-activated Gi2 alpha from the membrane and that the released Gi2 alpha exists in the cytosol as a soluble complex with unidentified component(s) in mastocytoma cells."

This response was followed by a 15-fold increase in the level of kidney epoxide hydrolase mRNA, while no change in mRNA level was noted in liver. Treated animals also showed no increase in mRNA levels for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase, cytochrome P-450b/e, cytochrome P-450PCN (where PCN is pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile), or serum albumin in either kidney or liver. Immunoquantitation of the enzyme revealed a 16-fold increase in kidney upon treatment with lead acetate, but significant changes in epoxide hydrolase levels were not noted in liver, heart, spleen, lung, small intestine, or testis. The enzymatic activity for liver and kidney paralleled the immunochemical results; however, the activity increase in kidney was only one-third of the increase noted for total enzyme protein. Immunohistochemical analysis of epoxide hydrolase protein in sections of rat kidney demonstrated that in lead acetate-treated animals there was a marked increase in staining of the cytoplasm of the proximal tubular cells in the outer cortex as compared with kidneys from control animals. In contrast, considerable protein was also localized to collecting ducts, but no change was evident in the content of the epoxide hydrolase gene product in these structures in control and lead acetate-treated animals. Immunohistochemical differences were not noted between livers from control and lead-treated animals. Furthermore, the staining patterns for NADPH-cytochrome P-450 oxidoreductase were the same for control and treated animals in both kidney and liver. Quantitative measurements of lead uptake by various rat tissues showed liver, spleen, and small intestine reaching a maximum of approximately 12,000 ng of lead/g of dry tissue at 8, 8, and 16 h, respectively, while kidney, lung, and testis peaked (approximately 3,000 ng of lead/g of dry tissue) at 16, 16, and 12 h, respectively."
