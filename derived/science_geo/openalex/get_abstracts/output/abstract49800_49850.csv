https://openalex.org/W2040389590,"The x-ray structure of chicken skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC), the Ca2+-binding subunit of the troponin complex, shows that the protein is about 70 angstroms long with an unusual dumbbell shape. The carboxyl and amino domains are separated by a single long alpha helix of about nine turns. Only the two high-affinity Ca2+-Mg2+ sites of the COOH-domain are occupied by metal ions resulting in conformational differences between the COOH- and NH2-domains. These differences are probably important in the triggering of muscle contraction by TnC. Also the structure of TnC is relevant in understanding the function of other calcium-regulated proteins, in particular that of calmodulin because of its strong similarity in amino acid sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1987136097,"Inexperienced, hypophysectomized female rats treated with steroids were used in experiments to investigate the roles of the pituitary gland and prolactin in the expression of maternal behavior. Administration of ovine prolactin or treatment with ectopic pituitary grafts, which release prolactin into the circulation, stimulated maternal care in these females toward rat young. Steroid treatment alone, while stimulating maternal behavior in rats with intact pituitary glands, did not facilitate maternal responsiveness in hypophysectomized females. These findings indicate a stimulatory behavioral role for pituitary prolactin in the establishment of maternal care and suggest that exposure to prolactin during pregnancy helps to stimulate the immediate onset of maternal behavior at parturition."

https://openalex.org/W2066571203,"Lactic acidosis, a clinical syndrome caused by the accumulation of lactic acid, is characterized by lactate concentration in blood greater than 5 mM. Therapy usually consists of intravenous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), but resultant mortality is greater than 60 percent. The metabolic and systemic effects of NaHCO3 therapy of hypoxic lactic acidosis in dogs were studied and compared to the effects of sodium chloride or no therapy. Sodium bicarbonate elevated blood lactate concentrations to a greater extent than did either sodium chloride or no treatment. Despite the infusion of NaHCO3, both arterial pH and bicarbonate concentration decreased by a similar amount in all three groups of dogs. Additional detrimental effects of NaHCO3 were observed on the cardiovascular system, including decreases in cardiac output and blood pressure that were not observed with either sodium chloride or no treatment. Thus there is evidence for a harmful effect of NaHCO3 in the treatment of hypoxic lactic acidosis."
https://openalex.org/W1582305847,"A new fluorophor for tubulin which has permitted the monitoring of microtubule assembly in vitro is reported. DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), a fluorophor already known as a DNA intercalator, was shown to bind specifically to a unique tubulin site as a dimer (KD(app) = 43 +/- 5 microM at 37 degrees C) or to tubulin associated in microtubules (KD(app) = 6 +/- 2 microM at 37 degrees C) with the same maximum enhancement in fluorescence. When tubulin polymerization was induced with GTP, the change in DAPI affinity for tubulin resulted in an enhancement of DAPI binding and, consequently, of fluorescence intensity. DAPI, whose binding site is different from that of colchicine, vinblastine, or taxol, did not interfere greatly with microtubule polymerization. It induced a slight diminution of the critical concentration for tubulin assembly due to a decrease in the depolymerizing rate constant. Moreover, DAPI did not interfere with GTP hydrolysis correlated with tubulin polymerization, but it decreased the GTPase activity at the steady state of tubulin assembly. Even at substoichiometric levels DAPI can be used to follow the kinetics of microtubule assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1480402741,"Inhibition of the oxidation of methyl linoleate and soybean phosphatidylcholine in homogeneous solution and in aqueous dispersion by four chain-breaking antioxidants, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, and stearyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, was studied to examine the effect of the phytyl side chain of vitamin E on its antioxidant activity. These four antioxidants exerted similar antioxidative activities. They were also effective as antioxidants in protecting the oxidation of soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes in water dispersion. However, when they were incorporated into dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes, only 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-chromanol and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol could suppress the oxidation of soybean phosphatidylcholine liposomes dispersed in the same aqueous system. It was concluded that the antioxidative properties of vitamin E and its model without the phytyl side chain are quite similar within micelles and liposomes as well as in homogeneous solution but that the phytyl side chain enhances the retainment of vitamin E in liposomes and suppresses the transfer of vitamin E between liposomal membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1574671132,"A membrane-bound Ca2+-dependent complex of the cofactor Factor Va and the enzyme Factor Xa comprises the prothrombinase coagulation complex which catalyzes the proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Analyses of the kinetics of prothrombin activation permit calculation of the stoichiometry and binding parameters governing the functional interactions of Factor Va and Factor Xa with isolated thrombin-activated human platelets and isolated leukocyte subpopulations. Our kinetic approach indicates that Factor Xa binds to approximately 2700 +/- 1000 (n = 8) functional sites on the surface of thrombin-activated platelets with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) equal to 1.18 +/- 0.53 X 10(-10) M and kcat equal to 19 +/- 7 mol of thrombin/s/mol of Factor Xa bound. The store of Factor V in normal platelets prevents an analogous determination of the functional Factor Va platelet binding sites. Factor Va and Factor Xa titrations performed using platelets from a Factor V antigen-deficient individual indicate that Factor Va and Factor Xa form a 1:1 stoichiometric complex on the surface of thrombin-activated platelets. Both binding isotherms are governed by the same apparent Kd (approximately equal to 10(-10) M) and expressed the same kcat/site (14-17 s-1. Factor Xa-platelet binding parameters are not altered by the use of different platelet agonists, the choice of anticoagulant, or platelet washing procedure. Kinetics of prothrombin activation indicate also that monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils possess, respectively, 16,000, 45,000, and 8,000 Factor Va-Factor Xa receptor sites/cell, which are all governed by apparent KdS approximately equal to 10(-10) M. Enzymatic complexes bound to monocytes or neutrophils exhibit kcat values similar to the platelet-bound complex. Complexes bound to lymphocytes are only 25% as active."

This observation indicates that arachidonic acid metabolites are important in the alveolar bone loss of periodontitis and suggests a use for flurbiprofen in the management of bone resorption disease."
https://openalex.org/W1623950794,"We have previously shown that a fluorescent derivative of phosphatidic acid, 1-acyl-2-[N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) aminocaproyl]phosphatidic acid (C6-NBD-PA) is rapidly transferred from liposomes to Chinese hamster fibroblasts at 2 degrees C, resulting in intense labeling of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear envelope, but not the plasma membrane. During this labeling, C6-NBD-PA is metabolized predominantly to fluorescent diacylglycerol (Pagano, R. E., Longmuir, K. J., Martin, O. C., and Struck, D. K. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 91, 872-877). In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which C6-NBD-PA enters cells and is translocated to intracellular membranes at low temperature. (i) When hydrolysis of C6-NBD-PA to diacylglycerol was prevented by using a nonhydrolyzable fluorescent phosphonate analog, intense labeling of the plasma membrane occurred but fluorescent lipid did not enter the cytoplasm of cells. (ii) Experiments using C6-NBD-PA and cells prelabeled with 32Pi demonstrated that some of the fluorescent diacylglycerol was rephosphorylated at 2 degrees C. (iii) When cells were treated with 1,3-[palmitoyl, N-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)aminocaproyl]-glycerophosphate, the lipid was dephosphorylated to 1,3-diacylglycerol but its rephosphorylation could not be detected. Nevertheless, rapid labeling of cytoplasmic membranes occurred. (iv) Formation of fluorescent diacylglycerol at the plasma membrane by treatment of cells with fluorescent phosphatidylcholine followed by phospholipase C at 2 degrees C resulted in strong labeling of intracellular membranes. Based on these results, a working model is presented for the uptake and intracellular translocation of phosphatidic acid involving formation of diacylglycerol at the plasma membrane followed by its transbilayer movement, facilitated translocation to intracellular membranes, and rephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1482729845,"5 S ribosomal RNA in Xenopus has been shown to be transcribed in vitro from 5 S RNA genes that remain stably associated with required factors through multiple rounds of (Bogenhagen, D. F., Wormington, W. M., and Brown, D. D. (1982) Cell 28, 413-421). We have studied the formation and stability of these transcription by using cloned 5 S RNA genes immobilized on cellulose as templates for the assembly of complexes in crude extracts. RNA polymerase III is the least tightly bound component required for of 5 S RNA genes. All other factors remain bound in 1 M NaCl, even though complexes do not form at salt concentrations as low as 0.25 M. RNA polymerase III dissociates from complexes as a result of RNA synthesis and is capable of reassociating with complexes to support additional rounds of transcription. A 5 S-specific positive factor (factor A) and two crude phosphocellulose column fractions (B and C) are also required for 5 S RNA synthesis in vitro (Engelke, D. R., Ng, S.-Y., Shastry, B. S., and Roeder, R. G. (1980) Cell 19, 717-728; Segall, J., Matsui, T., and Roeder, R. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 11986-11991; Shastry, B. S., Ng, S.-Y., and Roeder, R. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12979-12986). Fraction B stably interacts with 5 S RNA genes to form a stable, active complex only after the template has first been incubated with factor A and fraction C. In contrast, either factor A or fraction C can stably associate with 5 S RNA genes in the absence of other factors. The activities of fractions B and C are removed from solution as a result of complex formation, suggesting the factors in these fractions act stoichiometrically. The rate-limiting step in complex formation is carried out by fraction B, which accounts for the lag in activity observed in crude extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1964241643,"By means of their efferent projections to motor and premotor structures, the cells in the deep superior colliculus are intimately involved in behaviors that control the orientation of the eyes, pinnae, and head. These same efferent cells receive multiple sensory inputs, thereby apparently enabling an animal to orient its receptor organs in response to a wide variety of cues. This sensory convergence also provides a system in which motor responses need not be immutably linked to individual stimuli but can vary in reaction to the multitude of stimuli present in the environment at any given moment."
https://openalex.org/W1536042050,"Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) isolated from Flavobacterium heparinum was purified to homogeneity by a combination of hydroxylapatite chromatography, repeated gel filtration chromatography, and chromatofocusing. Homogeneity was established by the presence of a single band on both sodium dodecyl sulfate and acid-urea gel electrophoretic systems. Amino acid analysis shows that the enzyme contains relatively high amounts of lysine residues (9%) consistent with its cationic nature (pI 8.5) but contains only 4 cysteine residues/polypeptide. The molecular weight of heparinase was estimated to be 42,900 +/- 1,000 daltons by gel filtration and 42,700 +/- 1,200 daltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme is very specific, acting only on heparin and heparan monosulfate out of 12 similar polysaccharide substrates tested. It has an activity maximum at pH 6.5 and 0.1 M NaCl and a stability maximum at pH 7.0 and 0.15 M NaCl. The Arrhenius activation energy was found to be 6.3 kcal/mol. However, the enzyme is very sensitive to thermal denaturation and loses activity very rapidly at temperatures over 40 degrees C. Kinetic studies of the heparinase reaction at 37 degrees C gave a Km of 8.04 X 10(-6) M and a Vm of 9.85 X 10(-5) M/min at a protein concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml. By adapting batch procedures of hydroxylapatite and QAE (quaternary aminoethyl)-Sephadex chromatography, gram quantities of heparinase that is nearly free of catalytic enzyme contaminants can be purified in 4-5 h."
https://openalex.org/W2032322477,"A gene bank of DNA from the Lyme disease spirochete was constructed in the plasmid pBR322. Plasmid pTRH32, a recombinant that in Escherichia coli expresses the two major outer surface proteins of the Lyme disease spirochete, was identified. One of the recombinant products, designated OspA, represents a surface protein that appears to be common to all Lyme disease spirochetes, whereas the other recombinant product, designated OspB, represents a more variable surface protein. This recombinant plasmid provides a foundation for future studies on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of Lyme disease as well as on the genetic organization of the etiologic agent."

https://openalex.org/W2051719492,"In an experiment designed to test color constancy in a situation comparable to that used in E. H. Land's experiments with human observers, goldfish were trained to approach a particular color within a richly colored but variable ""Mondrian"" background. They retained the ability to identify colors accurately even when the spectral composition of the illuminant was radically altered in generalization tests. Since the behavior of fish resembles that of human beings in these tests, Land's retinex theory seems to apply to a relatively primitive vertebrate as well as to humans."

Village inhabitants ascribe antidiarrheal properties to the clay, and they use it in traditional medicinal preparations to counteract intestinal problems. Mineralogical analyses demonstrate a striking similarity between the Uzalla village clay and the clay in the commercial pharmaceutical Kaopectate."
https://openalex.org/W2075797850,"Images with high resolution and exceptionally broad gray scale can be obtained by the application of video contrast enhancement to an optimized procedure for imaging transparent objects with oblique rays of illumination. This technique is simple to set up. A conventional microscope with a light source whose position can be adjusted and a video camera with controls for gain and black level are the only essential components. Features such as high resolution, optical sectioning, control of contrast, and operation under low light intensity make this technique preferable, in several instances, to currently used video microscopy techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2081578051,The expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms was examined in normal and dystrophic chicken muscle with a monoclonal antibody specific for neonatal myosin. Adult dystrophic muscle continued to contain neonatal myosin long after it disappeared from adult normal muscle. A new technique involving western blotting and peptide mapping demonstrated that the immunoreactive myosin in adult dystrophic muscle was identical to that found in neonatal normal muscle. Immunocytochemistry revealed that all fibers in the dystrophic muscle failed to repress neonatal myosin heavy chain. These studies suggest that muscular dystrophy inhibits the myosin gene switching that normally occurs during muscle maturation.

https://openalex.org/W1501416111,"Combined lipase deficiency, cld, is a recessive mutation within the T/t complex of mouse chromosome 17. Mice homozygous for this defect display severe functional deficiencies of lipoprotein lipase and the related hepatic lipase. They develop massive hyperchylomicronemia and die within 3 days when allowed to suckle. Heart, diaphragm muscle, and brown adipose tissue of 1-day-old cld/cld and unaffected mice incorporated in vivo [35S]methionine into a protein that could be immunoprecipitated by antilipoprotein lipase serum. The immunoprecipitated protein in all tissues had the same Mr as bovine lipoprotein lipase as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proportion of radioactivity in the lipoprotein lipase band to that in total protein was 0.02% in tissues of cld/cld mice and 0.01% in tissues of unaffected mice. There was 2-6 times more lipoprotein lipase-like protein (determined by immunoassay) in tissues of defective mice than in those of unaffected mice. These findings indicate that the cld mutation did not cause deletion of the structural gene for lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein lipase activity in heart, diaphragm muscle, brown adipose tissue, and lung of cld/cld mice was less than 5% of that in tissues of unaffected mice. This low activity could be inhibited more than 85% by antilipoprotein lipase serum, but not by nonimmune serum. It is concluded that tissues in cld/cld mice synthesize a lipoprotein lipase-like protein which has subnormal catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2001005055,"The gustatory sense in catfish consists of two dissociable components, a facial nerve system used for food selection and a vagal nerve system involved in swallowing. Neural tracing experiments demonstrate that the primary sensory nucleus for the facial gustatory system is connected to the reticular formation and trigeminal nuclei. In contrast, the primary sensory nucleus for the vagal gustatory system is connected to the motoneurons that mediate swallowing. These results provide anatomical evidence for parallel gustatory systems within the vertebrate central nervous system."

The number of males responding increases with increasing odor concentration. Once a male has contacted a model, its attractiveness to other males is reduced, suggesting that the male may contribute an antiaphrodisiac cue so that other males avoid mated females."
https://openalex.org/W1582624231,"Abstract As is well known, the light scattering intensity of F-actin solutions increases immediately upon formation of the rigor complex with subfragment-1 (S-1). We have found that after the initial rise in scattering, there is a further gradual increase in scattering (we call it super-opalescence). Fluorescence and electron microscopic observations of acto-S-1 solutions showed that super-opalescence results from formation of actin filament bundles once S-1 binds to F-actin. The actin bundles possessed transverse stripes with a periodicity of about 350 A, which suggested that in the bundles actin filaments are arranged in parallel register. The rate of the initial process of bundle formation (i.e. side-by-side dimerization) could be approximately estimated by measuring the initial rate of super-opalescence (V0). V0 had a maximum (V0m) at a molar ratio of S-1 to actin of 1;6-1;7, regardless of the actin concentration, pH (6-8.5), Mg2+ concentration (up to 5 mM), or ionic strength (up to 0.3 M KC1). Lower pH, higher Mg2+ concentration, and higher ionic strength increased V0m; V0 was proportional to the square of the actin concentration, regardless of the solution conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2092345348,"Purification of two antigens (48-kilodalton polypeptide and a group with major subunits of 50 and 55 kilodaltons) from the infective larvae of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis was recently reported. Immunization of mice with either of these antigens induces strong resistance to a subsequent challenge infection. In the study reported here the mechanism of this resistance was investigated by monitoring the parasite's life cycle in mice immunized with the antigens. Immunized mice were able to expel intestinal adult worms and to inhibit the fecundity of adult female worms at an accelerated rate compared to control mice. Accelerated expulsion and inhibition of fecundity may account entirely for the level of resistance induced by immunization. Although the effects of the immune response apparently are exerted on adult worms, the target antigens are expressed only by developing larvae. This suggests that immune effector mechanisms act on intestinal larvae in such a way that they develop into defective adults."
https://openalex.org/W1572097032,"Equilibrium binding and activity studies indicate that adenosine 5'-diphosphate binds to phosphorylase kinase with high affinity at a site, or sites, distinct from the catalytic site. Equilibrium dialysis at pH 6.8 and 8.2, with and without Mg2+, and with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated enzyme preparations revealed approximately 8 ADP binding sites per alpha 4 beta 4 gamma 4 delta 4 hexadecamer, with Kd values ranging from 0.26 to 17 microM. Decreasing the pH from 8.2 to 6.8 or removing the Mg2+ enhanced the affinity for ADP. At pH 6.8, ADP stimulated the phosphorylase conversion and autophosphorylation activities of the nonactivated enzyme. Analogs of ADP with modifications at the 2'-, 3'-, and 5'-positions allowed determination of structural requirements for the stimulation of activity. ADP seems to alter the conformation of the beta subunit because addition of the nucleotide inhibits its dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatase and its chemical cross-linking by 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The binding affinities and effects of ADP suggest that it may function physiologically as an allosteric effector of phosphorylase kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1583278020,"The metabolism of pyrimidine nucleosides present in the plasma of the mouse has been examined. Uridine and cytidine are rapidly cleared from the circulation with t1/2 of less than 5 min. Uracil, deoxycytidine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine are cleared more slowly with t1/2 of 9 to 13 min. Various tissues differed markedly in the extent of nucleotide formation from circulating nucleosides. Cytidine and uridine are predominantly converted to nucleotides (greater than 50%) rather than catabolized, whereas uracil is almost entirely degraded. Thymidine, deoxyuridine, and deoxycytidine are intermediate in the extent of their conversion to nucleotides: 8.9 to 21% of these nucleosides are salvaged in the mouse. Both anabolic and catabolic routes are important in the metabolism of pyrimidine nucleosides in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1921390505,"The rate-limiting step in diphtheria toxin (DT) intoxication of Vero cells has been determined utilizing cycloheximide as an inhibitor of the intoxication process. Cycloheximide is shown to inhibit the toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). The inhibition is blocked by puromycin thus establishing the ribosome as the location of cycloheximide protection. Washing cells free of cycloheximide rapidly reverses the protective effect. The initial rates of protein synthesis inhibition observed after removal of cycloheximide from DT-intoxicated cells are 5 to 12-fold greater than rates observed in unprotected cells and are shown to reflect ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 by cytosolic DT. Ten to thirty minutes after cycloheximide removal, the rate of protein synthesis inhibition abruptly changes to values identical to those of unprotected cells. Both the initial rates and extent of the initial rapid inactivation are directly related to toxin concentration and time of incubation with DT in the presence of cycloheximide. We concluded that: the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis inhibition by DT is not the ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 by cytosolic toxin but rather the earlier entry step of DT into the cytosol. DT enters the cytosol as a bolus of sufficient size to rapidly inactivate all EF-2 in that cell. It is inferred from 1 and 2 that the first order inactivation rate exhibited by DT is the result of the probability of the release of a bolus of toxin to the cytosol of any cell in the population per unit time. Autoradiographic analysis of intoxicated cell populations support this two-population state model. The size of a single bolus or quantum of DT is calculated from data over the range of 10(-11) to 10(-9) M DT and is found to remain constant. We suggest that the cytosolic entry mechanism of DT results from a unique ability of the internalized toxin molecules to destabilize the vesicular membrane resulting in a random release of a bolus of toxin into the cytosol. Because the bolus size remains constant over a 50-fold change in receptor occupancy the possibility is raised that DT undergoes a post-receptor packaging process, package size remaining a constant and package number increasing with receptor occupancy."
https://openalex.org/W1965501497,A rapid increase in the temperature of the dark-adapted squid retina evoked by a brief light pulse was detected with a pyroelectric detector. The amount of heat generated by the retina in response to a pulse of blue light of moderate intensity was far greater than that produced by direct conversion of the stimulating light by the retinal pigments into thermal energy. D-Glucose in the medium was required to maintain the ability of the retina to produce light-evoked thermal responses.
https://openalex.org/W1521324013,"The presence of methionyl residues at positions 1 and 17 in porcine classical anaphylatoxin (e.g. C5a des-Arg-74) permits chemical cleavage of the factor with cyanogen bromide to generate two defined fragments. Peptides corresponding to the amino-terminal fragment, CN-I, and the carboxyl-terminal peptide, CN-II, were purified from the CNBr digest of C5a des-Arg-74 by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The isolated derivatives were assessed for their abilities to cause contraction of isolated guinea pig ileal smooth muscle, guinea pig lung parenchymal strips, and degranulation of guinea pig polymorphonuclear neutrophils. In each assay, CN-I was devoid of biological activity at concentrations greater than 10(-6) M. In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal 56-residue fragment, CN-II, possessed weak (10(-6) versus 10(-9) M for classical anaphylatoxin) agonist activity in each of the assay systems. Our data suggest that structural information contained in the amino-terminal 17 residues of the C5a des-Arg-74 molecule contributes to the biological potency of the intact factor, but is not an essential component of the active site. Whether the structural information in residues 1-17 relates to receptor binding directly or serves to stabilize the conformation of the 18-73-fragment containing the active center of the molecule is yet to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1529586428,"Two immunologically cross-reactive plasma membrane proteins, of Mr 80,000 and Mr 210,000, have been purified to apparent homogeneity from sperm of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Purification includes a combination of antibody and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. The two proteins have similar but not identical amino acid compositions; however, their carbohydrate composition differs substantially. After purification, the Mr 210,000 protein binds to both living eggs and isolated egg jelly in a species-specific manner, but the Mr 80,000 protein does not. The inactivity of the Mr 80,000 protein could be due to denaturation during purification. The data are consistent with a model in which the Mr 210,000 protein acts as a jelly receptor in the sperm membrane, promoting the ion movements necessary to initiate the sperm acrosome reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1538587981,"Glucocorticoids accelerate fetal lung maturation by acting on the fetal lung fibroblast to induce the synthesis of fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor which in turn stimulates pulmonary surfactant synthesis by the alveolar type II cell. We have studied the site of glucocorticoid regulation of fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor synthesis in primary cultures of fetal rat lung fibroblasts. Conditioned media from fetal rat lung fibroblasts exposed to cortisol stimulate [Me-3H]choline incorporation into saturated phosphatidylcholine by primary cultures of fetal rat lung alveolar type II cells. This effect is blocked by the presence of actinomycin D during the first, but not the second, 24 h of incubation of the fibroblasts with cortisol. Cycloheximide blocks this effect if present during either the first or second 24 h of incubation. We fractionated mRNA from fetal rat lung fibroblasts incubated in the presence or absence of dexamethasone and observed that cell-free translation products from a fraction of approximately 500 bases possess biological activity in the bioassay. Such activity is only present in cell-free translation products of mRNA isolated from fibroblasts treated with dexamethasone. These results suggest that glucocorticoids act at a pretranslational level to induce production of fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor and that the primary translation products are biologically active."
https://openalex.org/W1971170546,"We have generated C. elegans animals that carry a duplication as a free chromosome fragment bearing an ace-1+ gene in an otherwise homozygous ace-1 ace-2 genetic background. The single ace-1+ gene in these animals is responsible for coordinated animal movement and acetylcholinesterase activity in the regions of the nerve ring and ventral and dorsal nerve cords, as judged by histochemical assay. We have used other genes on the free duplication whose cell-specific expressions have already been elucidated to identify particular genetic mosaics produced by spontaneous somatic loss of the duplication. The analysis of these mosaics has led us to conclude that the synthesis of acetylcholinesterase by muscle cells is primarily responsible for the coordinated movement conferred by the ace-1+ gene."
https://openalex.org/W1574548782,"Native x-ray diffraction data from single crystals of inactive aconitase from pig heart (Mr 80,000) have been collected on oscillation films to 2.7 A. Analysis shows that significant measurements of the anomalous scattering signal from the Fe-S cluster in the enzyme are available in the film data. The 5.0-A resolution anomalous difference Patterson function contains vectors for one Fe-S cluster (one aconitase molecule) per asymmetric unit in space group P2(1)2(1)2 with a = 173.6, b = 72.0, and c = 72.7 A. At 2.7-A resolution, the vector map is best interpreted by three Fe sites separated from each other by less than 3 A. The single-crystal diffraction data thus confirm the presence of a 3Fe center in the inactive form of aconitase. Furthermore, the data provide crystallographic evidence that 3Fe clusters exhibit structural heterogeneity. The Fe-Fe vectors cannot be interpreted in terms of 4-A distances as observed for the [3Fe-3S] cluster in Azotobacter ferrodoxin (Ghosh, D., O'Donnell, S., Furey, W., Robbins, A. H., and Stout, C. D. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 158, 73-109). The results are therefore in agreement with a [3Fe-4S] cluster having 2.7-A Fe-Fe distances (Beinert, H., Emptage, M. H., Dreyer, J.-L., Scott, R. A., Hahn, J. E., Hodgson, K. O., and Thomson, A. J. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 393-396). However, the data do not unambiguously discriminate between this model and other 3Fe clusters having short Fe-Fe distances."
https://openalex.org/W1559142816,"The kinetics of oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to the monomeric liver fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) hemoglobin have been studied.

On the contrary the ligand dissociation rates decrease by lowering the pH below 7, the pK of the transition being around 5.5. These findings, together with spectroscopic properties of the protein, are discussed in relation to the fact that, in this hemoglobin, the distal histidine is replaced by a glycine."

Cross-linking of the enzyme with dimethyl suberimidate followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yields four distinct protein bands with molecular weights of 47,000, 93,000, 145,000, and 190,000. The molecular weight of the largest protein is in excellent agreement with that of the native enzyme. Carboxypeptidase A liberates 4 mol of COOH-terminal tyrosine/mol of enzyme, and the number of arginine-containing peptides in a tryptic digest of the enzyme is one-fourth of that arginine residues present in the enzyme. The enzyme reversibly binds 4 mol of the substrate adenosine in a noninteracting manner, and the binding is associated with the reduction of 3.2 mol of enzyme-bound NAD+. However, in the presence of dithiothreitol, the same compound causes a time-dependent irreversible loss of enzyme activity concomitant with the formation of 3.6 mol of enzyme-bound NADH/mol of enzyme. Studies with adenine-labeled adenosine shows that radioactivity corresponding to 3.8 mol of substrate is tightly bound to the inactivated enzyme. Since the inactivation is apparently the consequence of reaction of dithiothreitol with an enzyme-bound intermediate as revealed by the kinetics of inactivation, these results support the conclusion that the four subunits of rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase are functionally equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W1629193539,"The DNA-binding and physical properties of the rat liver cytosol glucocorticoid receptor were determined before and after Sephacryl S-300 filtration in the presence or absence of molybdate. Cytosol was prepared and labeled with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide in buffer containing molybdate. Prior to gel filtration, only 5 +/- 3% (mean +/- S.E.) of labeled receptors bound to DNA-cellulose. After gel filtration in the presence and absence of molybdate, the per cent of labeled receptors binding to DNA-cellulose was 57 +/- 10% and 83 +/- 1%, respectively. Nonreceptor fractions from the Sephacryl S-300 column contained a heat-stable factor which blocked receptor activation but did not block the binding of activated receptors to DNA-cellulose. The activation inhibitor eluted from the column in the region of the albumin standard, but after heating its size was considerably reduced (Mr less than 3500). Receptors activated by Sephacryl S-300 filtration underwent the same size changes in the presence or absence of molybdate. Prior to gel filtration, the S20,w of labeled receptors in the presence of molybdate was 9.2 +/- 0.2 S. After filtration in the presence and absence of molybdate, the S20,w of labeled receptors was 4.2 +/- 0.2 and 4.4 +/- 0.1 S, respectively. The Stokes radius (Rs) of labeled receptors after gel filtration in either the presence or absence of molybdate was 65 +/- 1 A. From the Rs and S20,w values, the molecular weight (Mr) of activated receptors was calculated to be 115,000 to 121,000, which was in close agreement with the Mr of affinity-labeled receptors determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W2083072888,"Organic chemistry as a discipline derives from and impacts on the biological and abiological world in which we live. Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity—chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology."
https://openalex.org/W1586236254,"Neutral glycolipids were purified from the glandular part of the stomach of rats of different ages from 20 days of gestation to 60 days after birth. The two major glycolipids were identified as glucosylceramide and isogloboside. Free ceramide was also detected. The concentrations of these sphingolipids remained almost stable with development. Monohexosylceramide contained 55 and 68% of 2-hydroxylated fatty acids at 20 and 22 days of gestation, respectively, and 82% in the adult. Its three major bases, C18-sphingenine, C18- and C20-4D-hydroxysphinganine were characterized by gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry of their N-acetyl-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives. The occurrence of the bases changed with development. C18-sphingenine contributed for 26% of the bases at birth and 65% in the adult. Conversely, C18-4D-hydroxysphinganine contributed for 35% of the bases at birth and 9% in the adult. The ceramide part of isogloboside consisted of nonhydroxylated fatty acids and mainly C18-sphingenine throughout development. The percentage of long-chain fatty acids was higher in older animals. These results stressed the specificity of the lipidic part of the rat gastric glycolipids and their specific evolution during the development."
https://openalex.org/W1515045558,"Transport and metabolism of D- and L-alanine by Aerococcus viridans (Gaffkya homari) have been studied using cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 13C and 15N NMR spectroscopy of lyophilized whole cells, isolated cell walls, and crude extracts. For equimolar concentrations in the growth medium, about 10 times more D-alanine than L-alanine is transported into the cells. Examination of cells labeled with D-[13C]alanine and L-[epsilon-15N]lysine by double cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 15N NMR indicates that only about 20% of the D-alanine present in cell-wall peptidoglycan comes directly from the growth medium. The rest is produced by de novo synthesis. Most of the labeled D-alanine is found within peptidoglycan precursors or inverted to L-alanyl residues of soluble proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1502374846,"When platelets are treated with H2O2 the metabolic ATP content decreases sharply (Holmsen, H., and Robkin, L. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 1752-1757). Here we report that the loss of metabolic energy is fully recovered in phosphorylated glycolytic intermediates. A mixture of antimycin A/2-deoxy-D-glucose/D-gluconic acid-1,5-lactone blocks mitochondrial ATP resynthesis and prevents the entry of sugars into the glycolytic sequence. The energy-rich phosphates in the adenylate and the glycolytic pool are then consumed in a specific order. First, the glycolytic pool is consumed at a rate of 4.5 mumol of ATP equivalents/min/10(11) cells, and metabolic ATP and ADP are kept stable; then the consumption of the glycolytic pool decreases and metabolic ATP and ADP are consumed, together keeping up with the same rate of energy consumption. Thrombin stimulation increases the energy consumption to about 17 mumol of ATPeq/min/10(11) cells which is now furnished by both the glycolytic and the adenylate pool, again with a preferential consumption of the former. The results show that H2O2 triggers a shift of energy-rich phosphates from the adenylate to the glycolytic pool and that the latter remains rapidly accessible to energy consumption thereby stabilizing the level of metabolic ATP. The adenylate energy charge is independent of the distribution of energy among the two pools, which extends its importance to the regulation of energy supply and demand beyond the adenylate pool."
https://openalex.org/W1535327305,"alpha-(N-Acetylaminomethylene)succinic acid hydrolase (Compound A hydrolase, EC 3.5.1-) and alpha-hydroxymethyl-alpha'-(N-acetylaminomethylene)succinic acid hydrolase (Compound B hydrolase, EC 3.5.1-) were purified to homogeneity from Pseudomonas MA-1 and Arthrobacter Cr-7, respectively. The two inducible enzymes catalyze Reactions 1 and 2, respectively, which release the first generally useful anabolic intermediates during growth of these organisms with (formula; see text) pyridoxine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Compound A hydrolase is a monomeric protein of Mr 32,500 with aspartic acid as its NH2-terminal residue. Compound B hydrolase (Mr congruent to 205,000) is a multimer containing probably six identical subunits with glycine as the NH2 terminus. The two enzymes have quite different amino acid analyses, although both are high in Asx and Glx, lack tryptophan, and show similar stabilities to pH and temperature. Compound A hydrolase has a pI of 4.4, a Km of 3.3 microM, and a Vmax of 3.1 mumol X min-1 X mg-1 at pH 6.5 and 25 degrees C; no analogue substrates were found. Compound B hydrolase has a pI of 4.2, a Km of 25 microM, and a Vmax of 3.8 mumol X min-1 X mg-1 at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0; it also hydrolyzes Compound A slowly. Both enzymes are inhibited competitively by di- and tricarboxylic acids, itaconic acid being among the most effective. Sulfite inhibits both enzymes by a time-dependent mechanism not yet understood. The two amidases appear to differ greatly in architecture despite the similarity in properties and in the overall reactions they catalyze."
https://openalex.org/W1578038226,"The geminate of CO with Hb following dissociation by a 10-ns laser pulse has been studied as a function of pH (9.2 and 7.0 without inositol hexaphosphate and 6.0 with inositol hexaphosphate) and temperature (5-35 degrees C). The hemoglobins studied included adult, Rothschild, rabbit, opossum, and carp. Despite significant differences in their structural and functional properties, the first four of these hemoglobins show similar trends in the yields, rates, and activation energies of the geminate recombination. The nature of the cage recombination in hemoglobin is discussed in the light of such findings. Neither a slow diffusion model nor a model based upon a specific non-heme binding site accounts for the observations."
https://openalex.org/W1555896429,"Abstract The relationship between alterations in transmembrane potential, cell volume, and phospholipid fatty acid turnover has been examined in human erythrocytes by treating the cells with the monovalent cation ionophore valinomycin. Valinomycin increases the cellular uptake of tetra[3H]phenylphosphonium ion by erythrocytes, indicating membrane hyperpolarization, and causes net loss of potassium chloride and water from the cells leading to a decrease in cell volume. Treatment of erythrocytes with valinomycin also enhances incorporation of [9, 10-(3)H]oleic acid into phospholipids, primarily diacylphosphatidylethanolamine. After replacing intracellular chloride with sulfate and treating cells with the anion transport inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, exposure to valinomycin results in uptake of tetra[3H]phenylphosphonium ion and stimulation of [9, 10-(3)H]oleic acid incorporation, but, because anion efflux is prevented, no decrease in cell volume occurs. When tetra[3H]phenylphosphonium ion uptake is also prevented by suspending these cells in 125 mM KCl to dissipate the transmembrane potassium gradient, valinomycin still enhances [9, 10-(3)H] oleic acid incorporation into phospholipid. These results suggest that the presence of valinomycin in the membrane directly alters phospholipid fatty acid turnover and that some of the effects of this ionophore on cellular function previously attributed to alterations in transmembrane potential or cellular potassium content may instead be due to altered phospholipid turnover. Since it is possible that valinomycin may directly perturb phospholipid fatty acid turnover in other cells, the possibility that valinomycin-induced alterations in cellular function are due to altered phospholipid turnover rather than membrane hyperpolarization or altered potassium content should be considered in the interpretation of studies employing this ionophore."
