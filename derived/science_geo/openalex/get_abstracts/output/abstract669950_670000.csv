https://openalex.org/W3134423407,"The worldwide spread of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019 has posed a severe threat to individuals’ well-being. While the world at large is waiting that the released vaccines immunize most citizens, public health experts suggest that, in the meantime, it is only through behavior change that the spread of COVID-19 can be controlled. Importantly, the required behaviors are aimed not only at safeguarding one’s own health. Instead, individuals are asked to adapt their behaviors to protect the community at large. This raises the question of which social concerns and moral principles make people willing to do so. We considered in 23 countries ( N = 6948) individuals’ willingness to engage in prescribed and discretionary behaviors, as well as country-level and individual-level factors that might drive such behavioral intentions. Results from multilevel multiple regressions, with country as the nesting variable, showed that publicized number of infections were not significantly related to individual intentions to comply with the prescribed measures and intentions to engage in discretionary prosocial behaviors. Instead, psychological differences in terms of trust in government, citizens, and in particular toward science predicted individuals’ behavioral intentions across countries. The more people endorsed moral principles of fairness and care (vs. loyalty and authority), the more they were inclined to report trust in science, which, in turn, statistically predicted prescribed and discretionary behavioral intentions. Results have implications for the type of intervention and public communication strategies that should be most effective to induce the behavioral changes that are needed to control the COVID-19 outbreak."

Many different pseudovirus platforms exist, each with different advantages and limitations. Here we report our efforts to optimize and characterize an HIV-based lentiviral pseudovirus assay for screening neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 using a stable 293T cell line expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). We assessed different target cells, established conditions that generate readouts over at least a two-log range, and confirmed consistent neutralization titers over a range of pseudovirus input. Using reference sera and plasma panels, we evaluated assay precision and showed that our neutralization titers correlate well with results reported in other assays. Overall, our lentiviral assay is relatively simple, scalable, and suitable for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 entry and neutralization screening assays."
https://openalex.org/W3134323379,"Measures implemented in many countries to contain the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a change in lifestyle with unpredictable consequences on physical and mental health. We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects. Promoting safe practice of physical activity should remain a public health priority to reduce health risks during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3134778922,"In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, public health experts have produced guidelines to limit the spread of the coronavirus, but individuals do not always comply with experts’ recommendations. Here, we tested whether a specific psychological belief—identification with all humanity—predicts cooperation with public health guidelines as well as helpful behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that peoples’ endorsement of this belief—their relative perception of a connection and moral commitment to other humans—would predict their tendencies to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and to help others. To assess this, we conducted a global online study ( N = 2537 participants) of four WHO-recommended health behaviors and four pandemic-related moral dilemmas that we constructed to be relevant to helping others at a potential cost to oneself. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that included 10 predictor variables (demographic, contextual, and psychological) for each of five outcome measures (a WHO cooperative health behavior score, plus responses to each of our four moral, helping dilemmas). Identification with all humanity was the most consistent and consequential predictor of individuals’ cooperative health behavior and helpful responding. Analyses showed that the identification with all humanity significantly predicted each of the five outcomes while controlling for the other variables ( P range &lt; 10 −22 to &lt; 0.009). The mean effect size of the identification with all humanity predictor on these outcomes was more than twice as large as the effect sizes of other predictors. Identification with all humanity is a psychological construct that, through targeted interventions, may help scientists and policymakers to better understand and promote cooperative health behavior and help-oriented concern for others during the current pandemic as well as in future humanitarian crises."
https://openalex.org/W3135054567,"Background Female sterilization is a permanent method of contraception practiced widely in India. Though, the important evidences of behavior of contraceptives is widespread in the literature, relatively less research has been conducted that explores particularly female sterilization method and how its behavior has remained dominant over the past two decades. The present study aims to examine how the level of women’s socio-demographic and fertility related characteristics intersect to shape the behavior for the dominance of female sterilization. Methods This study was based on pooled data from 1992–93, 1998–99, 2005–06 and 2015–16 India’s DHS (NFHS) surveys. The outcome variable of the study was different types of contraceptive methods used. Multinomial logistic model has been applied to examine the relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables. The software STATA version14 has been used for the entire analysis. Result The result of this study clearly demonstrates the evidence of continuing sterilization dominance in the India’s family planning program. The choice of different types of contraceptive methods is influenced by the longstanding heterogeneity of population associated with religion and the caste system. Reliance over female sterilization was observed in almost all parts of the country with southern India being the leading zone. Women in the lowest wealth quintile, uneducated, higher parity, and less exposed to media were more likely to use sterilization as a method of birth control. Conclusion The study was successful in identifying the factors behind the excessive dependency on female sterilization and also highlights the weakness of family planning program to promote other useful modern methods over the past two decades."
https://openalex.org/W3135076350,"Introduction Prenatal anxiety and depression are major health problems all over the world. The negative sequela of prenatal comorbid anxiety and depression (CAD) has been suggested to be higher than that of anxiety or depression alone. CAD increases the odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, prolonged labor, operative deliveries, postpartum psychiatric disorders and long term cognitive impairment for the newborn. Despite its significant ill consequences, there is a dearth of studies in low-and middle-income countries. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no study assessed the prevalence of CAD in Ethiopia. Hence, the purpose of this study was to assess CAD and associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch Zuria district, Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 676 pregnant women from January 01 to November 30, 2019. Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales were used to assess depression and anxiety respectively. The data were collected electronically using an open data kit (ODK) collect android application and analyzed using Stata version 15.0. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with CAD using binary logistic regression. Statistical significance was set at p-value &lt; 0.05. Results A total of 667 women were involved. The prevalence of CAD was 10.04% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.76, 12.33]. Being married [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.56], categorized in the highest wealth quintile [AOR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.17, 6.84], having medical illness [AOR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.68, 7.54], encountering pregnancy danger signs [AOR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.06, 6.67], experiencing life-threatening events [AOR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.92] and household food insecurity [AOR: 3.51, 95% CI: 1.85, 6.64] were significantly associated with CAD. Conclusions In general, one in every ten women faced CAD in the study area. Nutritional interventions, early identification and treatment of pregnancy-related illness and medical ailments, prenatal mental health problems screening and interventions are imperative to minimize the risk of CAD in pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W3134447691,"The development of digital solutions is becoming increasingly important in facing global challenges. Therefore, research on this topic is important in taking into account cardiac patients' experiences of the rehabilitation process for the design of digital counseling solutions. The aim of the present qualitative study was to explore the different meanings that patients give to the rehabilitation process using a Glaserian grounded theory (GT) approach. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 participants from a rehabilitation center in Finland. The findings indicated a ""complex trust-building process"" core category comprising five categories of trust-building in rehabilitation: feeling that one has hit rock bottom, facing and coping in a crosscurrent, understanding together as a peer group, moving toward a healthier lifestyle with technology, and finding self-awareness. The complex process of trust-building involved interactions among emotion, cognition, and acceptance and support processes. Therefore, digital rehabilitation should be incorporated into counseling based on patients' psychosocial, physical and emotional needs to help patients become aware of their own feelings and thoughts during the rehabilitation process."
https://openalex.org/W3133970117,"Plant polyphenols have an array of health benefits primarily thought to be related to their high content of anti-oxidants. These are commonly undervalued and knowledge of their biological properties have grown exponentially in the last decade. Polyphenol-rich sugarcane extract (PRSE), a natural extract from sugar cane, is marketed as high in anti-oxidants and polyphenols, but its anti-cancer activity has not been reported previously. We show that, PRSE exerts anti-cancer properties on a range of cancer cells including human (LIM2045) and mouse (MC38, CT26) colon cancer cells lines; human lung cancer (A549), human ovarian cancer (SKOV-3), pro-monocytic human leukemia (U937) and to mouse melanoma (B16) cell lines; whereas no effects were noted on human breast (ZR-75-1) and human colon (HT29) cancer cell lines, as well as to human normal colon epithelial cell line (T4056). Anti-proliferative effects were shown to be mediated via alteration in cytokines, VEGF-1 and NF-κB expression."
https://openalex.org/W3134022380,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive malignancy classified by the World Health Organization as a grade IV glioma. Despite the availability of aggressive standard therapies, most patients experience recurrence, for which there are currently no effective treatments. We aimed to conduct a phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of adoptive, ex-vivo- expanded, and activated natural killer cells and T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with recurrent GBM. This study was a single-arm, open-label, investigator-initiated trial on 14 patients recruited between 2013 and 2017. The immune cells were administered via intravenous injection 24 times at 2-week intervals after surgical resection or biopsy. The safety and clinical efficacy of this therapy was examined by assessing adverse events and comparing 2-year overall survival (OS). Transcriptomic analysis of tumor tissues was performed using NanoString to identify the mechanism of therapeutic efficacy. No grade 4 or 5 severe adverse events were observed. The most common treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most severe adverse event was grade 3 fever. Median OS was 22.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 10 months. Five patients were alive for over 2 years and showed durable response with enhanced immune reaction transcriptomic signatures without clinical decline until the last follow-up after completion of the therapy. In conclusion, autologous adoptive immune-cell therapy was safe and showed durable response in patients with enhanced immune reaction signatures. This therapy may be effective for recurrent GBM patients with high immune response in their tumor microenvironments.

https://openalex.org/W3134367109,"The atomizers of electronic cigarettes (ECs) contain metals that transfer to the aerosol upon heating and may present health hazards. This study analyzed 4th-generation EC pod atomizer design features and characterized their elemental/metal composition.Eleven EC pods from six brands/manufacturers were purchased at local shops and online. Pods were dissected and imaged using a Canon EOS Rebel SL2 camera. Elemental analysis and mapping of atomizer components was done using a scanning electron microscope coupled with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer.EC pods varied in size and design. The internal atomizer components were similar across brands except for variations occurring mainly in the wicks and filaments of some products. The filaments were either Elinvar (nickel, iron, and chromium) (36.4%), nichrome (36.4%), iron-chromium (18.2%), or nickel (9%). Thick wires present in 55% of the atomizers were mainly nickel and were joined to filaments by brazing. Wire-connector joints were Elinvar. Metal air tubes were made of Elinvar (50%), nickel, zinc, copper, and tin (37.5%), and nickel and copper (12.5%). Most of the wick components were silica, except for two pods (PHIX and Mico), which were mainly ceramic. Connectors contained gold-plated nickel, iron-chromium multiple alloys of nickel, zinc, gold, iron, and copper. Wick chambers were made of Elinvar. Outer casings were either nickel, copper-tin, or nickel-copper alloys. Magnets were nickel with minor iron, copper, and sulfur. Some frequently occurring elements were high in relative abundance in atomizer components.The atomizers of pods are similar to previous generations, with the introduction of ceramic wicks and magnets in the newer generations. The elements in EC atomizers may transfer into aerosols and adversely affect health and accumulate in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3135831963,"Investigation of the mechanisms responsible for aggressive neuroblastoma and its poor prognosis is critical to identify novel therapeutic targets and improve survival. Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is known to play a key role in supporting the malignant phenotype in several cancer types and knockdown of EZH2 has been shown to decrease tumorigenesis in neuroblastoma cells. We hypothesized that the EZH2 inhibitor, GSK343, would affect cell proliferation and viability in human neuroblastoma. We utilized four long-term passage neuroblastoma cell lines and two patient-derived xenolines (PDX) to investigate the effects of the EZH2 inhibitor, GSK343, on viability, motility, stemness and in vivo tumor growth. Immunoblotting confirmed target knockdown. Treatment with GSK343 led to significantly decreased neuroblastoma cell viability, migration and invasion, and stemness. GSK343 treatment of mice bearing SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma tumors resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals. GSK343 decreased viability, and motility in long-term passage neuroblastoma cell lines and decreased stemness in neuroblastoma PDX cells. These data demonstrate that further investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumor effects seen with EZH2 inhibitors in neuroblastoma cells is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3134130577,"Background Gut colonization by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) is widespread and is promoted by antibiotic exposure. Higher fecal abundance of ESBL-PE promotes the dissemination of the bacteria in the environment and is associated with increased risk of infection. Ceftriaxone and temocillin are commonly used antibiotics with a different activity on gut flora. Their impact on fecal abundance of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae has not been studied. The objective of this study was to compare the propensity of ceftriaxone and temocillin to modify the abundance of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in feces of colonized mice. Methods Mice received broad-spectrum antibiotics in order to disrupt their normal gut flora. A CTX-M-type ESBL-producing E . coli clinical isolate was then administered orally, leading to durable colonization. Thirty days later, mice received either temocillin or ceftriaxone with drinking water at a concentration simulating human intestinal exposure. Third-generation-cephalosporin resistant (3GCR) E . coli were enumerated in feces on selective medium before, 2 days and 10 days after the end of antibiotic exposure. The experiment was performed with two E . coli isolates with different temocillin minimum inhibitory concentrations. Results Exposure to ceftriaxone induced an increase in the fecal abundance of 3GCR E . coli . In contrast, temocillin had no effect or transiently decreased the number of 3GCR E . coli . Results obtained with the two strains were similar. Conclusion Contrary to ceftriaxone, temocillin does not promote expansion of ESBL-producing E . coli in feces of colonized mice. Thus temocillin may be a therapeutic of choice when a temocillin-susceptible strain infection is suspected or proven to prevent the expansion of ESBL-PE in a previously colonized patient."
https://openalex.org/W3134359383,"Eco-cities have witnessed rapid growth in these years worldwide. As the Eco-cities entering operation stage gradually, more and more researchers have found that users (who are living or working in the Eco-cities) satisfaction is one of the most important factors to determine the success or failure of Eco-cities. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the user demands to attract more citizens willing to live or work in the Eco-cities, which will make the development of Eco-cities more sustainable and solid. The recent researches on user demands investigation and analysis in the Eco-cities mainly focused on understanding the user need itself, yet lack of research on the relationship between the user demand and user satisfaction. This paper initially introduced the Kano model analysis method to the research field of user demands in Eco-city, to explore the relationship between the user demand and user satisfaction. After proposing user demands library in Eco-city (including Land use, Ecological environment, Green building, Energy utilization, etc.), the user demands classification and importance analysis methods of Eco-city were proposed based on Kano model. The questionnaire survey for users of two Eco-cities in China as case study was conducted, consisted of user demand items questionnaire based on the Kano model and a questionnaire on the importance of the user demand items. By utilizing the integration of quantitative analysis methods based on the Kano model and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, the final ranking of user demands importance was obtained. Comparing with the existing literatures in terms of user demands research for Eco-city, the user demands analysis method based on Kano model of this paper, is able to reveal the influence degree of user satisfaction towards the facilities and services provided in the Eco-city. The user demands analysis method can be used for other researchers worldwide to investigate and quantitively analyze user demands according to their local development situation and preference of Eco-city. The user demands analysis results obtained through this method, can benefit different stages of Eco-city."
https://openalex.org/W3134361921,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor with unfavorable prognosis. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of microRNA (miR)-1246 detection in various body fluids as a biomarker for this disease. A total of 72 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled, and their blood, urine, and saliva samples were collected prior to treatment. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of miR-1246 was performed, and pre- and postoperative and intraday fluctuations in its expression were examined. The expression of miR-1246 in the blood and urine was significantly higher in the patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma than in 50 healthy control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the area under the curve values were 0.91 (sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 76.0%), 0.82 (sensitivity 90.3%, specificity 62.0%), and 0.80 (sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 66.0%) in the serum, urine, and saliva, respectively. A relatively high diagnostic performance of miR-1246 was observed in all samples, which was better than that of the existing biomarkers squamous cell carcinoma antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cytokeratin 19 fragment. No clear correlation was observed in the levels of miR-1246 expression among the three body fluids. Postoperatively, serum samples displayed significantly decreased miR-1246 levels. Although not significant, changes in the miR-1246 levels were observed at all collection times, with large fluctuations in the saliva. Meanwhile, serum miR-1246 expression was found to be associated with the disease prognosis. The results indicate that the levels of miR-1246 in the urine, saliva, and serum are a useful biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and support the use of urine samples instead of blood samples for noninvasive diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3134718160,"Diaporthe eres has been recently reported as the causal agent of hazelnut defects, with characteristic brown spots on the kernels surface and internal fruit discoloration. Knowledge regarding the ecology of this fungus is poor but, is critical to support a rationale and effective hazelnut crop protection strategy. Therefore, a study was performed to describe and model the effect of different abiotic factors such as temperature (T, 5–35°C, step 5°C) and water activity (a w 0.83–0.99, step 0.03) regimes on D . eres mycelial growth, pycnidial conidiomata development and asexual spore production during a 60-day incubation period. Alpha conidia germination was tested in the same T range and at different relative humidities (RH = 94, 97 and 100%) over 48 h incubation period. Fungal growth was observed from the first visual observation; regarding pycnidia and cirrhi, their development started after 8 and 19 days of incubation, respectively and increased over time. The optimum T for growth was 20–25°C and for pycnidia and cirrhi development was 30°C; a w ≥ 0.98 was optimal for the tested steps of the fungal cycle. The best condition for conidial germination of D . eres was at 25°C with RH = 100%. Quantitative data obtained were fitted using non- linear regression functions (Bete, logistic and polynomial), which provided a very good fit of the biological process (R 2 = 0.793–0.987). These functions could be the basis for the development of a predictive model for the infection of D . eres of hazelnuts."

Real-time motion features are extracted via deep reinforcement networks. DCNN tracks the recognized objects, and the LSTM algorithm predicts the ball’s trajectory. The model is tested on a self-built video dataset and existing systems and compared with other algorithms to verify its effectiveness. Finally, an overall tactical detection system is built to measure ball rotation and predict ball trajectory. Results demonstrate that in feature extraction, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm has the best performance, with a maximum accuracy rate of 89% and a minimum mean square error of 0.2475. The accuracy of target tracking effect and trajectory prediction is as high as 90%. Compared with traditional methods, the performance of the DCNN-LSTM model based on deep learning is improved by 23.17%. The implemented automatic detection system of table tennis tactical indicators can deal with the problems of table tennis tracking and rotation measurement.

Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequently recovered species from human cases and poultry are considered the most important reservoir for its transmission to humans. In this study, 30 Campylobacter jejuni isolates were selected from clinical (n = 15) and broiler (n = 15) sources from a larger cohort, based on source, virulence, and antimicrobial resistance profiles. The objective of this study was to further characterise the genomes of these isolates including MLST types, population structure, pan-genome, as well as virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants. A total of 18 sequence types and 12 clonal complexes were identified. The most common clonal complex was ST-45, which was found in both clinical and broiler samples. We characterised the biological functions that were associated with the core and accessory genomes of the isolates in this study. No significant difference in the prevalence of virulence or antimicrobial resistance determinants was observed between clinical and broiler isolates, although genes associated with severe illness such as neuABC , wlaN and cstIII were only detected in clinical isolates. The ubiquity of virulence factors associated with motility, invasion and cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) synthesis in both clinical and broiler C . jejuni genomes and genetic similarities between groups of broiler and clinical C . jejuni reaffirm that C . jejuni from poultry remains a significant threat to public health."
https://openalex.org/W3134208727,"Introduction The post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) encompasses multiple, diverse conditions, such as physical disability, cognitive impairment, and depression. We sought to evaluate whether conditions within PICS have similar associations with mortality among survivors of critical illness. Materials and methods In this retrospective cohort study, we identified 248 critically ill patients with intensive care unit stay ≥72 hours, who underwent PICS evaluation. Patients with disability in activities of daily living, cognitive impairment, or depression before hospitalization were excluded. We defined PICS using established measures of physical disability (usual gait speed), cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog test), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) at hospital discharge. The endpoint was all-cause mortality. Results Patients had a median age of 69 years and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score of 16. One hundred thirty-two patients were classified as having PICS, and 19 patients died. 81/248 (34%) patients had physical disability, 42/248 (19%) had cognitive impairment, and 44/248 (23%) had depression. After adjusting for covariates on multivariable Cox regression analyses, PICS was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 – 13.95; P = 0.046). However, the association between PICS and all-cause mortality was related to physical disability and cognitive impairment ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.027, respectively), while depression was not ( P = 0.623). Conclusion While PICS as a syndrome has been useful in gaining attention to the sequelae of critical illness, its relationship with long-term mortality is driven largely by physical disability and cognitive impairment and not depression."
https://openalex.org/W3134774187,"Background Several forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) disproportionately affect women. Animal and human studies suggest that estradiol exerts mixed effects on the pulmonary vasculature. Whether premature menopause represents a risk factor for PH is unknown. Methods and findings In this cohort study, women in the UK Biobank aged 40–69 years who were postmenopausal and had complete data available on reproductive history were included. Premature menopause, defined as menopause occurring before age 40 years. Postmenopausal women without premature menopause served as the reference group. The primary outcome was incident PH, ascertained by appearance of a qualifying ICD code in the participant’s UK Biobank study record. Of 136,715 postmenopausal women included, 5,201 (3.8%) had premature menopause. Participants were followed up for a median of 11.1 (interquartile range 10.5–11.8) years. The primary outcome occurred in 38 women (0.73%) with premature menopause and 409 (0.31%) without. After adjustment for age, race, ever-smoking, body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, cholesterol-lowering medication use, C-reactive protein, prevalent type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, venous thromboembolism, forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second-to-FVC ratio, use of menopausal hormone therapy, and hysterectomy status, premature menopause was independently associated with PH (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.31–3.23, P&lt;0.001). In analyses of alternate menopausal age thresholds, risk of PH appeared to increase progressively with younger age at menopause (P trend &lt;0.001), with 4.8-fold risk in women with menopause before age 30 years (95% CI 1.82–12.74, P = 0.002). Use of menopausal hormone therapy did not modify the association of premature menopause with PH. Conclusions Premature menopause may represent an independent risk factor for PH in women. Further investigation of the role of sex hormones in PH is needed in animal and human studies to elucidate pathobiology and identify novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3135691435,"The Scythians are frequently presented, in popular and academic thought alike, as highly mobile warrior nomads who posed a great economic risk to growing Mediterranean empires from the Iron Age into the Classical period. Archaeological studies provide evidence of first millennium BCE urbanism in the steppe while historical texts reference steppe agriculture, challenging traditional characterizations of Scythians as nomads. However, there have been few direct studies of the diet and mobility of populations living in the Pontic steppe and forest-steppe during the Scythian era. Here, we analyse strontium, oxygen, and carbon isotope data from human tooth enamel samples, as well as nitrogen and carbon isotope data of bone collagen, at several Iron Age sites across Ukraine commonly associated with ‘Scythian’ era communities. Our multi-isotopic approach demonstrates generally low levels of human mobility in the vicinity of urban locales, where populations engaged in agro-pastoralism focused primarily on millet agriculture. Some individuals show evidence for long-distance mobility, likely associated with significant inter-regional connections. We argue that this pattern supports economic diversity of urban locales and complex trading networks, rather than a homogeneous nomadic population."
https://openalex.org/W3133639923,"For transgender people, reaching transgender (trans)-specific developmental milestones, including recognizing and expressing one's identity, plays an integral role in overall health, wellbeing, and the pursuit of gender affirmation. Yet trans people continue to face minority stressors, including structural violence (i.e., discrimination, violence, and stigma), which may interfere with the achievement of these milestones. Among trans women specifically, however, potential associations between gender developmental milestones and structural violence are not well characterized in the literature. In a sample of Filipinx (i.e., an inclusive term for describing non-binary genders in the Philippines) trans women who are sexually active with men (trans-WSM), we thus sought to: (a) describe the mean ages at which gender developmental milestones occur and (b) examine the associations between structural violence and mean ages at which at which Filipinx trans-WSM experience trans-specific developmental milestones.Using data from Project #ParaSaAtin, an online survey of Filipinx trans-WSM (n = 139), we mapped age-estimates per trans-specific milestones and then tested whether structural violence is associated with the mean age at which trans women experience trans-specific developmental milestones.Overall, participants who reported higher levels of discrimination, stigma, and violence also experienced a later age for nearly each milestone (i.e., initial self-awareness of transfeminine identity, transfeminine expression in private, transfeminine expression in public, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner, first consensual oral/vaginal/anal sex with a cisgender male partner as a trans women, and hormone integration) (all p-values <0.05). Of note, the single exception to this pattern was the non-significant association between stigma and initial disclosure of transfeminine identification to another person.Results are consistent with psychological literature outlining a temporal sequence of developmental milestones among young trans-WSM. For young trans-WSM in the Philippines, data from this study demonstrate significant associations between structural violence and the achievement of developmental milestones. These findings highlight the need for trauma-informed, strengths-based programming and institutional policies that measure and mitigate anti-trans violence."
https://openalex.org/W3134031737,"Risk models have historically displayed only moderate predictive performance in estimating mortality risk in left ventricular assist device therapy. This study evaluated whether machine learning can improve risk prediction for left ventricular assist devices. Primary durable left ventricular assist devices reported in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support between March 1, 2006 and December 31, 2016 were included. The study cohort was randomly divided 3:1 into training and testing sets. Logistic regression and machine learning models (extreme gradient boosting) were created in the training set for 90-day and 1-year mortality and their performance was evaluated after bootstrapping with 1000 replications in the testing set. Differences in model performance were also evaluated in cases of concordance versus discordance in predicted risk between logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting as defined by equal size patient tertiles. A total of 16,120 patients were included. Calibration metrics were comparable between logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting. C-index was improved with extreme gradient boosting (90-day: 0.707 [0.683–0.730] versus 0.740 [0.717–0.762] and 1-year: 0.691 [0.673–0.710] versus 0.714 [0.695–0.734]; each p&lt;0.001). Net reclassification index analysis similarly demonstrated an improvement of 48.8% and 36.9% for 90-day and 1-year mortality, respectively, with extreme gradient boosting (each p&lt;0.001). Concordance in predicted risk between logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting resulted in substantially improved c-index for both logistic regression and extreme gradient boosting (90-day logistic regression 0.536 versus 0.752, 1-year logistic regression 0.555 versus 0.726, 90-day extreme gradient boosting 0.623 versus 0.772, 1-year extreme gradient boosting 0.613 versus 0.742, each p&lt;0.001). These results demonstrate that machine learning can improve risk model performance for durable left ventricular assist devices, both independently and as an adjunct to logistic regression."
https://openalex.org/W3135128190,"The Argentine Black and White Tegu ( Salvator merianae , formerly Tupinambis merianae ) is a large lizard from South America. Now established and invasive in southern Florida, and it poses threats to populations of many native species. Models suggest much of the southern United States may contain suitable temperature regimes for this species, yet there is considerable uncertainty regarding either the potential for range expansion northward out of tropical and subtropical zones or the potential for the species establishing elsewhere following additional independent introductions. We evaluated survival, body temperature, duration and timing of winter dormancy, and health of wild-caught tegus from southern Florida held in semi-natural enclosures for over a year in Auburn, Alabama (&gt; 900 km northwest of capture location). Nine of twelve lizards emerged from winter dormancy and seven survived the greater-than-one-year duration of the study. Average length of dormancy (176 d) was greater than that reported in the native range or for invasive populations in southern Florida and females remained dormant longer than males. Tegus grew rapidly throughout the study and the presence of sperm in the testes of males and previtellogenic or early vitellogenic follicles in female ovaries at the end of our study suggest the animals would have been capable of reproduction the following spring. The survival and overall health of the majority of adult tegus in our study suggests weather and climate patterns are unlikely to prevent survival following introduction in many areas of the United States far from their current invasive range."
https://openalex.org/W3093278405,"We investigated whether collective narcissism (i.e., believing that the in-group is exceptional but insufficiently recognized by others) and in-group satisfaction (i.e., believing that the in-group is a source of satisfaction) have opposite, unique associations with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge (i.e., an expectation of emotional reward from harming others in response to feeling oneself harmed). Results of two studies conducted in Poland (N = 675) found that collective narcissism is positively related to belief in the hedonistic function of revenge, whereas in-group satisfaction is negatively related, and both are related to intergroup aggression. These relationships were found only when the overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction was partialled out. The results shed a new light on the mechanisms linking in-group positivity to out-group derogation, and highlight the importance of investigating revenge motivations in the intergroup relations."
https://openalex.org/W3134256518,"Aim To identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) that predict response to Methotrexate (MTX) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Materials and methods DNA from baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cells was extracted from 72 RA patients. DNA methylation, quantified using the Infinium MethylationEPIC, was assessed in relation to response to MTX (combination) therapy over the first 3 months. Results Baseline DMPs associated with response were identified; including hits previously described in RA. Additionally, 1309 DMR regions were observed. However, none of these findings were genome-wide significant. Likewise, no specific pathways were related to response, nor could we replicate associations with previously identified DMPs. Conclusion No baseline genome-wide significant differences were identified as biomarker for MTX (combination) therapy response; hence meta-analyses are required."
https://openalex.org/W3134320128,"Healthcare professionals provide paid care at work and potentially have caregiving responsibilities outside of work; work responsibilities in addition to child and/or elder care is considered double- or triple-duty care. Employees may experience conflict and/or enrichment as their work and family responsibilities interface. This study’s purpose is to explore the work and family interface of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs), determine the prevalence of work-family conflict and enrichment, and identify characteristics associated with higher work-family conflict and enrichment scores. A survey instrument assessing caregiving responsibilities and work-family conflict and enrichment was distributed electronically to 4,900 RDNs throughout the United States. Frequencies, means, correlative relationships, and ANCOVA were calculated using SAS software 9.04. Of 1,233 usable responses, nearly two-thirds of RDNs (65.5%) reported providing either double-duty or triple-duty care. About half of RDNs (47.2%) reported work-family conflict and fewer (14.8%) reported family-work conflict. Additionally, most RDNs (79.4%) reported work-family enrichment and even more (85.2%) reported family-work enrichment. Higher work-family conflict scores had correlative relationships with higher levels of burnout, lower life satisfaction, and higher intent to quit. Higher work-family enrichment scores had correlative relationships with lower burnout, higher job satisfaction, higher career satisfaction, higher life satisfaction, and lower intent to quit. Understanding the unpaid caregiving responsibilities of RDNs and the interface of work/family responsibilities may provide insight into career planning for RDNs and guide managers of RDNs in efforts to amplify the contribution of RDNs."
https://openalex.org/W3134555277,"Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal orphan cancers and new treatment alternatives beyond traditional chemotherapeutic regimes are much needed. So far, tumor mutation analysis has not led to significant treatment advances, and we have attempted to bypass this limitation by performing direct drug testing of a library of 353 anti-cancer compounds that are either FDA-approved, in clinical trial, or in advanced stages of preclinical development on a panel of 13 liposarcoma cell lines. We identified and validated six drugs, targeting different mechanisms and with good efficiency across the cell lines: MLN2238 -a proteasome inhibitor, GSK2126458 -a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, JNJ-26481585 -a histone deacetylase inhibitor, triptolide-a multi-target drug, YM155 -a survivin inhibitor, and APO866 (FK866)-a nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase inhibitor. GR50s for those drugs were mostly in the nanomolar range, and in many cases below 10 nM. These drugs had long-lasting effect upon drug withdrawal, limited toxicity to normal cells and good efficacy also against tumor explants. Finally, we identified potential genomic biomarkers of their efficacy. Being approved or in clinical trials, these drugs are promising candidates for liposarcoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3135656727,"The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) population in Nangunhe National Nature Reserve in China represents a unique evolutionary branch that has been isolated for more than twenty years from neighboring populations in Myanmar. The scarcity of information on population structure, sex ratio, and body condition makes it difficult to develop effective conservation measures for this elephant population. Twelve individuals were identified from 3,860 valid elephant images obtained from February to June 2018 (5,942 sampling effort nights) at 52 camera sites. Three adult females, three adult males, one subadult male, two juvenile females, two juvenile males and one male calf were identified. The ratio of adult females to adult males was 1:1, and the ratio of reproductive ability was 1:0.67, indicating the scarcity of reproductive females as an important limiting factor to population growth. A population density of 5.32 ± 1.56 elephants/100 km2 was estimated using Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR) models. The health condition of this elephant population was assessed using an 11-point scale of Body Condition Scoring (BCS). The average BCS was 5.75 (n = 12, range 2-9), with adult females scoring lower than adult males. This isolated population is extremely small and has an inverted pyramid age structure and therefore is at a high risk of extinction. We propose three plans to improve the survival of this population: improving the quality and quantity of food resources, removing fencing and establishing corridors between the east and wet parts of Nangunhe reserve."
https://openalex.org/W3135820042,"Odonata can be sampled following different types of protocols. In Brazil, the most used protocol is the scanning in fixed areas method, where a 100-meter transect is delimited in one of the stream margins, subdivided into 20 segments measuring 5 meters. Despite being universally used, the methodological efficiency or limitations of this protocol for Odonata has never been tested. In this scenario, our objective was to assess the efficiency of the sampling protocol to measure the richness and composition of Odonata in three fundamental aspects: the time of sampling and sampling effort over time and space. We show that the best sampling efficiency was achieved in collections performed at noon, in transects measuring 100 meters, requiring at least two samplings in the same location, supporting the procedures traditionally adopted by many studies with the group. While comparing species composition, we did not see any implication between the different treatments on the capture of the local species pool. However, we highlight and discuss some possible methodological flaws when using this protocol to sample specific Odonata groups. We believe the results obtained are fundamental in the inventory of species and to conduct future studies, as well as to aid conservative measures that use the order Odonata as a tool for environmental monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W3005699072,"Objective To study women’s apprehensions, understanding and experiences of counselling concerning a screen-positive result in screening for fetal chromosomal defects. Methods A questionnaire study including different steps of the prenatal screening process was carried out in Helsinki University Hospital. Women’s experiences concerning counselling immediately after a screen-positive result and during further examinations in the Fetal Medicine Unit (FMU) were analyzed. Results 143 women filled in the questionnaire. Less than half of the women considered the primary counselling after a screen-positive result to be explicit (43.9%) and sufficient (43.1%). In the FMU, 88.3% and 89.8% of women were satisfied with the explicitness and sufficiency of counselling. Most women (75%) experienced worry before further examinations but less than half (45%) had considered their personal values concerning diagnostic tests. Half (50.5%) of women expected the worry to continue even if diagnostic tests turn out normal. Most (81%) women were aware that diagnostic tests are voluntary and were confident (85.3%) with their decision to participate. Conclusions After a screen-positive result, women have unanswered questions, experience anxiety and confusion. The possibility of an abnormal screening result is not seriously considered beforehand. To enable an informed consent for prenatal screening, improvements in prescreening counselling during the first visits of antenatal care need to be made."
https://openalex.org/W3134349218,"A reliable, selective and sensitive stability-indicating RP-HPLC assay was established for the quantitation of bromazepam (BMZ) and one of the degradant and stated potential impurities; 2-(2-amino-5-bromobenzoyl) pyridine (ABP). The assay was accomplished on a C 18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size), and utilizing methanol-water (70: 30, v/v) as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min -1 . HPLC detection of elute was obtained by a photodiode array detector (DAD) which was set at 230 nm. ICH guidelines were adhered for validation of proposed method regarding specificity, sensitivity, precision, linearity, accuracy, system suitability and robustness. Calibration curves of BMZ and ABP were created in the range of 1–16 μg mL -1 with mean recovery percentage of 100.02 ± 1.245 and 99.74 ± 1.124, and detection limit of 0.20 μg mL -1 and 0.24 μg mL -1 respectively. BMZ stability was inspected under various ICH forced degradation conditions and it was found to be easily degraded in acidic and alkaline conditions. The results revealed the suitability of the described methodology for the quantitation of the impurity (ABP) in a BMZ pure sample. The determination of BMZ in pharmaceutical dosage forms was conducted with the described method and showed mean percentage recovery of 99.39 ± 1.401 and 98.72 ± 1.795 (n = 6), respectively. When comparing the described procedure to a reference HPLC method statistically, no significant differences between the two methods in regard to both accuracy and precision were found."
https://openalex.org/W3135225098,"Journalists’ health and science reporting aid the public’s direct access to research through the inclusion of hyperlinks leading to original studies in peer-reviewed journals. While this effort supports the US-government mandate that research be made widely available, little is known about what research journalists share with the public. This cross-sectional exploratory study characterises US-government-funded research on cancer that appeared most frequently in news coverage and how that coverage varied by cancer type, disease incidence and mortality rates. The subject of analysis was 11436 research articles (published in 2016) on cancer funded by the US government and 642 news stories mentioning at least one of these articles. Based on Altmetric data, researchers identified articles via PubMed and characterised each based on the news media attention received online. Only 1.88% (n = 213) of research articles mentioning US government-funded cancer research included at least one mention in an online news publication. This is in contrast to previous research that found 16.8% (n = 1925) of articles received mention by online mass media publications. Of the 13 most common cancers in the US, 12 were the subject of at least one news mention; only urinary and bladder cancer received no mention. Traditional news sources included significantly more mentions of research on common cancers than digital native news sources. However, a general discrepancy exists between cancers prominent in news sources and those with the highest mortality rate. For instance, lung cancer accounted for the most deaths annually, while melanoma led to 56% less annual deaths; however, journalists cited research regarding these cancers nearly equally. Additionally, breast cancer received the greatest coverage per estimated annual death, while pancreatic cancer received the least coverage per death. Findings demonstrated a continued misalignment between prevalent cancers and cancers mentioned in online news media. Additionally, cancer control and prevention received less coverage from journalists than other cancer continuum stages, highlighting a continued underrepresentation of prevention-focused research. Results revealed a need for further scholarship regarding the role of journalists in research dissemination."

We particularly focus on the legal and institutional conditions under which this ride-sharing platform could spread to customers online. Using a unique cross-national, longitudinal dataset, we employ event history models to investigate the effect of institutional environment on the diffusion of Uber. The results suggest that the establishment of the rule of law has a positive impact on the spread of Uber, even after controlling for economic and political characteristics. In addition, the overall quality of governmental regulations on markets is positively related to the diffusion of this ride-sharing platform. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the sharing economy by identifying critical institutional factors that enable the transformation of business models worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3135521262,"Over the past decade, artemisinin (ART)-combination therapies (ACTs) have shown declining efficacy within Southeast Asia (SEA). These resistance-like phenomena manifest as a delayed clearance phenotype (DCP) in some patients treated with ACTs. ACTs are currently the recommended treatment for P. falciparum infections by the World Health Organization (WHO), and they are our last line of defense to effectively treat all strains of malaria. Acceleration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is often theorized to be exacerbated by the use of subtherapeutic dosages of drugs (""substandard"" drug), which for ACTs has been well documented over the last decade. Troublingly, in 2017, the WHO estimated that nearly 1 in 10 medical products tested in low- and middle-income countries failed to meet quality standards. We have developed a tissue culture-based approach for testing possible connections between substandard treatment and the spread of ACT resistant blood stage forms of P. falciparum. Via sequencing of pfk13, a molecular marker that is predictive for ART resistance (ARTR), we monitor competition of sensitive vs resistant strains over time and under various conditions and define conditions that favor emergence of ARTR parasites. Our findings help to define the conditions under which substandard drug treatments might favor the proliferation of mutant PfK13-mediated drug resistant strains over drug sensitive."
https://openalex.org/W3135885914,"Aims The present study aimed to determine factors associated with the frequency of paralyzed upper extremity (UE) use in chronic stroke patients with severe UE functional deficiency. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 138 consecutive patients, and 117 was analyzed (median age, 55 [range, 18–85] years; median stroke duration, 24.5 [range, 7–302] months) with chronic hemiparetic stroke who were admitted to our hospital for intensive upper extremity rehabilitation. The mean Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) UE score was 28.6. All of them are independent in their activity of daily living (ADL) and without remarkable cognitive deficits. Amount-of-use score of Motor Activity Log-14 (MAL-AOU) was applied as the index of daily use of affected UE. The following parameters were examined as the explanatory variables: demographics, proximal and distal sub-scores of FMA UE, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and sensory function scores in the Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS). Results The median MAL-AOU score was 0.57 [range, 0.28–0.80]. Ordinal regression analysis revealed that FMA proximal, FMA distal, and SIAS sensory function (touch) were associated with AOU score of MAL-14 (Pseudo R-square = 0.460). Conclusion Not only motor but also sensory function, especially tactile sensation, play a crucial role in the daily use of affected UE in chronic stroke patients with severe UE hemiparesis."
https://openalex.org/W3134459684,"With advances in neuroimaging and genetics, imaging genetics is a naturally emerging field that combines genetic and neuroimaging data with behavioral or cognitive outcomes to examine genetic influence on altered brain functions associated with behavioral or cognitive variation. We propose a statistical approach, termed imaging genetics generalized structured component analysis (IG-GSCA), which allows researchers to investigate such gene-brain-behavior/cognitive associations, taking into account well-documented biological characteristics (e.g., genetic pathways, gene-environment interactions, etc.) and methodological complexities (e.g., multicollinearity) in imaging genetic studies. We begin by describing the conceptual and technical underpinnings of IG-GSCA. We then apply the approach for investigating how nine depression-related genes and their interactions with an environmental variable (experience of potentially traumatic events) influence the thickness variations of 53 brain regions, which in turn affect depression severity in a sample of Korean participants. Our analysis shows that a dopamine receptor gene and an interaction between a serotonin transporter gene and the environment variable have statistically significant effects on a few brain regions’ variations that have statistically significant negative impacts on depression severity. These relationships are largely supported by previous studies. We also conduct a simulation study to safeguard whether IG-GSCA can recover parameters as expected in a similar situation."
https://openalex.org/W3135834057,"Sleep is crucial for college students’ well-being. Although recommended sleep duration is between 7–9 hours per day, many students do not sleep that much. Scholar demands are among the causes of observed sleep deprivation in youth. We explored the influence of having a school test on previous night sleep in first-year students and the association of sleep duration and test performance. We ran two surveys in freshman students of the Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay: 1) 97 students of the School of Sciences who took the test at the same time; and 2) 252 School of Psychology students who took the test in four successive shifts. More than 1/2 of the participants (survey #1) and almost 1/3 (survey #2) reported short regular sleep duration (&lt; 7h). In both samples, the sleep duration of the night before the test was reduced with respect to regular nights (survey #1: 2.1 ± 0.2 h, p &lt; 0.001; survey #2: between 1.7 ± 0.4 h and 3.6 ± 0.3 h, all p &lt; 0.001), with more than 10% of the students who did not sleep at all. In survey 2, sleep duration increased in later shifts ( F (3,248) = 4.6, p = 0.004). Using logit regressions, we confirmed that sleep duration was positively related to test scores in both samples (survey #1: exp B = 1.15, p &lt; 0.001; pseudo- R 2 = 0.38; survey #2: exp B = 1.03, p &lt; 0.001; pseudo- R 2 = 0.25). Delaying test start time may prevent the reduction in sleep duration, which may also improve school performance. In addition, educational policies should include information for students about the impact of sleep on learning and of the consequences of reduced sleep duration."
https://openalex.org/W3093096950,"The digital spread of misinformation is one of the leading threats to democracy, public health, and the global economy. Popular strategies for mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging binary classifications reduced social learning and maintained polarization. The benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants’ education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship."

Methods This study was based on retrospective interpretation of prospectively acquired data. Thirty-eight consecutive patients (28 females and 10 males; mean age ± standard deviation, 3.2 ± 2.2 months) who underwent propranolol treatment for infantile hemangioma were included. Pre-treatment ultrasound images were assessed in terms of echogenicity, lesion height and vascularity. Presence of prominent intratumoral fat, non-fat septa, and enhancement pattern on MRI were retrospectively evaluated. Mann-Whitney test, chi-square, and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare imaging parameters between patients with treatment success and failure. Results All patients underwent ultrasound and 15 patients underwent MRI. A total of 24 patients showed successful treatment. Between patients with treatment success and failure, there were significant differences in increased vascularity on pre-treatment ultrasound (19/24 vs. 6/14, p = 0.025), decreased vascularity on post-treatment ultrasound (21/24 vs. 5/14, p = 0.001), and prominent intratumoral fat on MRI (1/8 vs. 5/7 p = 0.033). There were no significant differences in echogenicity, lesion height on ultrasound, non-fat septa and MR enhancement pattern. Conclusions Increased vascularity on pre-treatment ultrasound was significantly associated with successful treatment for propranolol therapy in patients with infantile hemangioma, whereas prominent fat component on MRI was significantly associated with treatment failure."

However, in many cases, the dynamic component of mobility data is not considered directly. In this paper, we study how topological indexes and community structure changes in a business day. For the analyzes, we use a mobility database with a high temporal resolution. Our case study is the city of São José dos Campos (Brazil)—the city is divided into 55 traffic zones. More than 20 thousand people were asked about their travels the day before the survey (Origin-Destination Survey). We generated a set of graphs, where each vertex represents a traffic zone, and the edges are weighted by the number of trips between them, restricted to a time window. We calculated topological properties, such as degree, clustering coefficient and diameter, and the network’s community structure. The results show spatially concise community structures related to geographical factors such as highways and the persistence of some communities for different timestamps. These analyses may support the definition and adjustment of public policies to improve urban mobility. For instance, the community structure of the network might be useful for defining inter-zone public transportation."
https://openalex.org/W3133958055,"There are a few existing studies on whether domestic migration improves China’s pension system’s fiscal sustainability in the context of rapid urbanization and industrialization. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of migration on the solvency of the worker’s old-age insurance for urban employees by constructing actuarial and econometric models. We use panel data from 2002 to 2018, collected from 31 provinces in China. The results show that the association between migration and the solvency of pensions is an inverted-U shape along the urbanization process. Further regional comparison showed that the above-stated inverted-U curve is more pronounced in the central and western regions. We also established that the number of participants and the contribution base are the main contributors to these results. Our conclusions are important for future population policies and public pension systems in China."
https://openalex.org/W3134336942,"Emotional stability-Neuroticism is a complex construct influenced by genetics and environmental factors. Women tend to exhibit higher neuroticism scores than men, which may be associated with an increased risk of suffering from some common mental conditions. Some authors have pointed out the influence of sex hormones, since they induce sexual differentiation of the brain that can lead to sex-specific behaviors. 2D:4D digit ratio is commonly used as a marker of prenatal sex hormones. In this study we analyzed whether there was an association between 2D:4D and personality measured through the BFQ in a homogeneous sample of 101 young women college students. We found a positive association between 2D:4D and emotional stability, as well as with its subdimensions emotion control and impulse control. This association could be quadratic and nonlinear. However, no association was found with the other four dimensions. We also measured anxiety, depression and global life satisfaction, variables related to neuroticism. We observed that emotional stability is positively associated to social desirability and global life satisfaction, and negatively related to anxiety and depression. On the other hand, we did not find any association between 2D:4D and anxiety, depression, and global life satisfaction. These results can be linked to other aspects such as subjective well-being and psychopathological symptoms. This study may help to better understand how these constructs are related and could lead to future projects to elucidated how these variables influence personality."
https://openalex.org/W3135568943,"Helicobacter pylori infection does not belong to the spectrum of opportunistic infections in people living with HIV (PLHIV). To evaluate the Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence rate trends in HIV co-infected individuals in comparison to the HIV-negative population, we compared histopathological findings of H . pylori positive gastritis (gastritis topography and histopathology) between 303 PLHIV and 2642 HIV-negative patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) between 1993 and 2014 due to dyspeptic symptoms. The prevalence of H . pylori infection was significantly higher in HIV-negative controls than in PLHIV (50.2% vs. 28.1%). A significantly positive linear trend of H . pylori co-infection in PLHIV was revealed in the observed period (b = 0.030, SE = 0.011, p = 0.013), while this trend was significantly negative in HIV-negative patients (b = - 0.027, SE = 0.003, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with HIV/ H . pylori co-infection had significantly higher CD4 + T cell counts and more often had undetectable HIV viremia, due to successful anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Stomach histopathological findings differed between HIV co-infected and H . pylori mono-infected patients. Our findings confirm that the ART has changed the progression of HIV infection, leading to a significant increase in the prevalence of H . pylori infection in dyspeptic PLHIV over time. Our data also suggests that a functional immune system may be needed for H . pylori -induced human gastric mucosa inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3134478321,"Traffic disturbances (i.e. pollution, light, noise, and vibrations) often extend into the area surrounding a road creating a ‘road-effect zone’. Habitat within the road-effect zone is degraded or, in severe cases, completely unsuitable for wildlife, resulting in indirect habitat loss. This can have a disproportionate impact on wildlife in highly modified landscapes, where remaining habitat is scarce or occurs predominantly along roadside reserves. In this study, we investigated the road-effect zone for insectivorous bats in highly cleared agricultural landscapes by quantifying the change in call activity with proximity to three major freeways. The activity of seven out of 10 species of bat significantly decreased with proximity to the freeway. We defined the road-effect zone to be the proximity at which call activity declined by at least 20% relative to the maximum detected activity. The overall road-effect zone for bats in this region was 307 m, varying between 123 and 890 m for individual species. Given that this road-effect zone exceeds the typical width of the roadside verges (&lt;50 m), it is possible that much of the vegetation adjacent to freeways in this and similar landscapes provides low-quality habitat for bats. Without accounting for the road-effect zone, the amount of habitat lost or degraded due to roads is underestimated, potentially resulting in the loss of wildlife, ecosystem services and key ecosystem processes (e.g. predator-prey or plant-pollinator interactions) from the landscape. We suggest all future environmental impact assessments include quantifying the road-effect zone for sensitive wildlife, in order to best plan and mitigate the impact of roads on the environment. Mitigating the effects of new and existing roads on wildlife is essential to ensure enough high-quality habitat persists to maintain wildlife populations."

Despite the high rates of this diagnosis among Portuguese adults, there is a lack of measures to assess it. In this study, we assessed the psychometric properties of a Portuguese adaptation of the Adult Separation Anxiety questionnaire (ASA-27) on a sample of 267 adults (72.7% women) aged 18–80 years ( M = 40.5, SD = 13.1). Factor structure, internal consistency, and convergence validity were examined. This study confirmed the single-factor structure of the Portuguese version of ASA-27. Consistency was high for the total sample (ω = .92) and by gender (ω = .93 and 92, men and women groups, respectively). The scale was positively related to the Portuguese version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) ( r = .57, p &lt; .001, for both State and trait anxiety scales) and Composite Codependency Scale total score ( r = .29, p &lt; .001). In addition, the ASA-27 total score showed incremental validity in the explanation of anxiety measured by STAI. In conclusion, results show that the Portuguese version of the ASA-27 is a reliable and valid measure of ASAD."

We recruited sixty native Cantonese listeners to participate in two experimental tasks: (a) a Cantonese-version reading span task to measure their working memory (WM) capacity and (b) a standard cross-modal priming task to measure the lexical disambiguation time. The results revealed that (1) the underlying mechanism of the disambiguation process seemed favorable for an inhibition approach and (2) the frequency of the individual meanings of the ambiguous words and the numbers of their meanings might interact with the WM capacity during lexical access, particularly for the low-WM span group."
https://openalex.org/W3135389102,"In the Simon task, participants perform a decision on non-spatial features (e.g., stimulus color) by responding with a left or right key-press to a stimulus presented on the left or right side of the screen. In the flanker task, they classify the central character while ignoring the flanking characters. In each task, there is a conflict between the response-relevant features and the response-irrelevant features (i.e., the location on the screen for the Simon task, and the flankers for the flanker task). Thus, in both tasks, resolving conflict requires to inhibit irrelevant features and to focus on relevant features. When both tasks were combined within the same trial (e.g., when the row of characters was presented on the left or right side of the screen), most previous research has shown an interaction. In the present study, we investigated whether this interaction is affected by a multiplicative priming of the correct response occurring when both Simon and flanker irrelevant features co-activate the correct response (Exp. 1), a spatial overlap between Simon and flanker features (Exp. 2), and the learning of stimulus-response pairings (Exp. 3). The results only show an impact of multiplicative priming."
https://openalex.org/W3135466317,"Among various Naga communities of Northeast India, megalithic building and feasting activities played an integral role in the different and intertwined dimensions of social and political organisation until very recently. During a collaborative fieldwork in 2016, we visited different village communities in the southern areas of Nagaland and recorded local knowledge about the function and social implications of megalithic building activities. The preserved knowledge of the monuments themselves and their embeddedness in complex feasting activities and social structures illustrate the multifaceted character of megalithic building. The case study of Nagaland highlights how the construction of megalithic monuments may fulfil very different functions in societies characterised by institutionalised hierarchies than in those that have a more egalitarian social organisation. The case study of southern Naga communities not only shows the importance of various dimensions and courses of action–such as sharing and cooperation, competitive behaviour, and the influence of economic inequality–, but also the importance of social networks and different layers of kinship. The multifaceted and interwoven character of megalithic building activities in this ethnoarchaeological case study constitutes an expansion for the interpretation of archaeological case studies of monumentality."
https://openalex.org/W3135720413,"When presented with an oscillatory sensory input at a particular frequency, F [Hz], neural systems respond with the corresponding frequency, f [Hz], and its multiples. When the input includes two frequencies ( F1 and F2 ) and they are nonlinearly integrated in the system, responses at intermodulation frequencies (i.e., n1 * f1 + n2 * f2 [Hz], where n1 and n2 are non-zero integers) emerge. Utilizing these properties, the steady state evoked potential (SSEP) paradigm allows us to characterize linear and nonlinear neural computation performed in cortical neurocircuitry. Here, we analyzed the steady state evoked local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortex of anesthetized cats (maintained with alfaxalone) while we presented slow ( F1 = 23Hz) and fast ( F2 = 200Hz) somatosensory vibration to the contralateral paw pads and digits. Over 9 experimental sessions, we recorded LFPs from N = 1620 and N = 1008 bipolar-referenced sites in S1 and S2 using electrode arrays. Power spectral analyses revealed strong responses at 1) the fundamental ( f1 , f2 ), 2) its harmonic, 3) the intermodulation frequencies, and 4) broadband frequencies (50-150Hz). To compare the computational architecture in S1 and S2, we employed simple computational modeling. Our modeling results necessitate nonlinear computation to explain SSEP in S2 more than S1. Combined with our current analysis of LFPs, our paradigm offers a rare opportunity to constrain the computational architecture of hierarchical organization of S1 and S2 and to reveal how a large-scale SSEP can emerge from local neural population activities."
