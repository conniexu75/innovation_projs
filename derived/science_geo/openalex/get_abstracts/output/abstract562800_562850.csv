https://openalex.org/W2472705372,"Pharmacovigilance contributes to health care. However, direct access to the underlying data for academic institutions and individual physicians or pharmacists is intricate, and easily employable analysis modes for everyday clinical situations are missing. This underlines the need for a tool to bring pharmacovigilance to the clinics. To address these issues, we have developed OpenVigil FDA, a novel web-based pharmacovigilance analysis tool which uses the openFDA online interface of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to access U.S. American and international pharmacovigilance data from the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). OpenVigil FDA provides disproportionality analyses to (i) identify the drug most likely evoking a new adverse event, (ii) compare two drugs concerning their safety profile, (iii) check arbitrary combinations of two drugs for unknown drug-drug interactions and (iv) enhance the relevance of results by identifying confounding factors and eliminating them using background correction. We present examples for these applications and discuss the promises and limits of pharmacovigilance, openFDA and OpenVigil FDA. OpenVigil FDA is the first public available tool to apply pharmacovigilance findings directly to real-life clinical problems. OpenVigil FDA does not require special licenses or statistical programs."
https://openalex.org/W2471121878,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with increasing prevalence affecting millions of people worldwide. Currently, only autopsy is able to confirm the diagnosis with a 100% certainty, therefore, biomarkers from body fluids obtained by non-invasive means provide an attractive alternative for the diagnosis of Alzheimer`s disease. Global changes of the protein profile were examined by quantitative proteomics; firstly, electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS were used, thereafter, SRM-based targeted proteomics method was developed and applied to examine quantitative changes of tear proteins. Alterations in the tear flow rate, total tear protein concentration and composition of the chemical barrier specific to AD were demonstrated, and the combination of lipocalin-1, dermcidin, lysozyme-C and lacritin was shown to be a potential biomarker, with an 81% sensitivity and 77% specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2470601847,"Xenobiotics exposure increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proliferation and cytochrome P-450 (CYP) induction to sustain metabolic requirements. Whether autophagy is essential for the removal of excess ER and CYP and whether an autophagy receptor is involved in this process in mammals remains elusive. In this study, we show that autophagy is induced in mouse livers after withdrawal of the hepatic mitogen 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP). Although isolated autophagosomes, autolysosomes, and lysosomes from mouse livers after withdrawal of TCPOBOP contained ER proteins, those in control mouse livers did not. Liver-specific Atg5 knockout mice had higher basal hepatic ER content that was further increased and sustained after withdrawal of TCPOBOP compared with wild-type mice. In addition to regulating ER degradation, our results also suggest that autophagy plays a role in regulating the homeostasis of hepatic CYP because blocking autophagy led to increased CYP2B10 accumulation either at the basal level or following TCPOBOP withdrawal. Furthermore, we found that the autophagy receptor protein sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62 is associated with the ER. After withdrawal of TCPOBOP, p62 knockout mice had increased ER content in the liver compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that p62 may act as an autophagy receptor for the autophagic removal of excess ER in the mouse liver. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy is important for the removal of excess ER and hepatic CYP enzymes in mouse livers, a process associated with the autophagy receptor protein p62."
https://openalex.org/W2428905495,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP), whose mutations cause Alzheimer disease, plays an important in vivo role and facilitates transmitter release. Because the APP cytosolic region (ACR) is essential for these functions, we have characterized its brain interactome. We found that the ACR interacts with proteins that regulate the ubiquitin-proteasome system, predominantly with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases Stub1, which binds the NH2 terminus of the ACR, and CRL4(CRBN), which is formed by Cul4a/b, Ddb1, and Crbn, and interacts with the COOH terminus of the ACR via Crbn. APP shares essential functions with APP-like protein-2 (APLP2) but not APP-like protein-1 (APLP1). Noteworthy, APLP2, but not APLP1, interacts with Stub1 and CRL4(CRBN), pointing to a functional pathway shared only by APP and APLP2. In vitro ubiquitination/ubiquitome analysis indicates that these E3 ligases are enzymatically active and ubiquitinate the ACR residues Lys(649/650/651/676/688) Deletion of Crbn reduces ubiquitination of Lys(676) suggesting that Lys(676) is physiologically ubiquitinated by CRL4(CRBN) The ACR facilitated in vitro ubiquitination of presynaptic proteins that regulate exocytosis, suggesting a mechanism by which APP tunes transmitter release. Other dementia-related proteins, namely Tau and apoE, interact with and are ubiquitinated via the ACR in vitro This, and the evidence that CRBN and CUL4B are linked to intellectual disability, prompts us to hypothesize a pathogenic mechanism, in which APP acts as a modulator of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase(s), shared by distinct neuronal disorders. The well described accumulation of ubiquitinated protein inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases and the link between the ubiquitin-proteasome system and neurodegeneration make this concept plausible."
https://openalex.org/W2473104846,"Background The World Health Organization recommends intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in African regions with moderate to high malaria transmission. However, growing resistance to SP threatens the effectiveness of IPTp-SP, and alternative drugs are needed. This study tested the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of a fixed-dose combination azithromycin-chloroquine (AZCQ; 250 mg AZ/155 mg CQ base) for IPTp relative to IPTp-SP. Methods and Findings A randomized, Phase 3, open-label, multi-center study was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) between October 2010 and November 2013. Pregnant women received 3 IPTp courses with AZCQ (each course: 1,000/620 mg AZCQ QD for 3 days) or SP (each course 1,500/75 mg SP QD for 1 day) at 4- to 8-week intervals during the second and third trimester. Long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets were also provided at enrollment. Study participants were followed up until day 28 post delivery (time window: day 28–42). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes (a composite endpoint comprising live-borne neonates with low birth weight [LBW, <2,500 g], premature birth [<37 weeks], still birth [>28 weeks], abortion [≤28 weeks], lost to follow-up prior to observation of pregnancy outcome, or missing birth weight). The study was terminated early after recruitment of 2,891 of the planned 5,044 participants, due to futility observed in a pre-specified 35% interim analysis. In the final intent-to-treat dataset, 378/1,445 (26.2%) participants in the AZCQ and 342/1,445 (23.7%) in the SP group had sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes, with an estimated risk ratio (RR) of 1.11 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.25; p = 0.12). There was no significant difference in the incidence of LBW between treatment groups (57/1138 [5.0%] in the AZCQ group, 68/1188 [5.7%] in the SP group, RR 0.87 [95% CI: 0.62, 1.23]; p = 0.44). IPTp-AZCQ was less well-tolerated in mothers than IPTp-SP. Occurrences of congenital anomalies, deaths, and serious adverse events were comparable in neonates for both groups. Limitations included the open-label design and early study termination. Conclusions IPTp-AZCQ was not superior to IPTp-SP in this study and alternatives for IPTp-SP remain to be identified. The proportions of sub-optimal pregnancy outcomes and LBW were lower than expected, which may be linked to insecticide-treated bednet use throughout the study. Reduced incidences of symptomatic malaria infection and peripheral parasitemia in the AZCQ group relative to SP suggest that AZCQ warrants further investigation as an alternative treatment of uncomplicated malaria.

https://openalex.org/W2463716254,"Six Veillonella species have been frequently isolated from human oral cavities including infectious sites. Recently, it was reported that diet, smoking, and possibly socioeconomic status can influence the bacterial profile in oral cavities. In addition, oral hygiene habits may also influence oral microbiota in terms of both numbers and diversity of microorganisms. In this study, the identification of Veillonella species in tongue biofilms of Thai children, divided into three groups dependent on their status of oral hygiene. For this, we used a novel one-step PCR method with species-specific primer sets based on sequences of the rpoB gene. As shown in the results, the number of isolates of Veillonella species was 101 strains from only 10 of 89 subjects. However, the total number of bacteria was high for all subjects. Since it was reported in previous studies that Veillonella species were easy to isolate in human tongue biofilms at high numbers, the results obtained in this study may suggest country- or age-specific differences. Moreover, Veillonella species were detected predominantly in subjects who had poor oral hygiene compared to those with good or moderate oral hygiene. From these results, there is a possibility that Veillonella species may be an index of oral hygiene status. Furthermore, V. rogosae was a predominant species in tongue biofilms of Thai children, whereas V. parvula and V. denticariosi were not isolated at all. These characteristics of the distribution and frequency of Veillonella species are similar to those reported in previous studies. Although further studies are needed in other countries, in this study, a successful novel one-step PCR method was established to detect Veillonella species in human oral cavities easily and effectively. Furthermore, this is the first report investigating the distribution and frequency of Veillonella species in tongue biofilms of Thai children."
https://openalex.org/W2470702181,"The utility of genome assemblies does not only rely on the quality of the assembled genome sequence, but also on the quality of the gene annotations. The Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology is a powerful support for accurate eukaryotic gene model annotation as it allows for direct readout of full-length cDNA sequences without the need for noisy short read-based transcript assembly. We propose the implementation of the TeloPrime Full Length cDNA Amplification kit to the Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology in order to enrich for genuine full-length transcripts in the cDNA libraries. We provide evidence that TeloPrime outperforms the commonly used SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit in identifying transcription start and end sites in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we show that TeloPrime-based Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq can be successfully applied to the polyploid genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) not only to efficiently annotate gene models, but also to identify novel transcription sites, gene homeologs, splicing isoforms and previously unidentified gene loci."

Autophagy is a highly conserved biological mechanism that is responsible for lysosome-dependent recycling of long-lived abnormal or misfolded proteins as well as dysfunctional or unnecessary organelles (such as depolarized mitochondria) (1.Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. et al.Autophagy as a cell death and tumor suppressor mechanism.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, basal autophagy help maintain cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is rapidly up-regulated following stress, including nutrient deprivation, accumulation of misfolded proteins, mitochondrial depolarization, or exposure to toxic chemicals (2.Levine B. Klionsky D.J. et al.Development by self-digestion: molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar). Autophagy malfunctions were shown to contribute to several pathologies, such as neurodegenerative diseases, lysosomal storage disorders, and cancer (3.Rubinsztein D.C. Mariño G. Kroemer G. et al.Autophagy and aging.Cell. 2011; 146: 682-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). The process starts with the nucleation and elongation of double-membrane structures called “autophagosomes” or “autophagic vesicles.” As they mature through fusion with late endosomes or lysosomes, vesicles give rise to “autolysosomes,” a hybrid compartment in which vesicle contents are degraded by the action of lysosomal hydrolases (4.Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. et al.Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). So far, around 33 different core autophagy proteins (ATGs) were described (5.Walker S. Chandra P. Manifava M. Axe E. Ktistakis N.T. et al.Making autophagosomes: localized synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate holds the clue.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Among them, two ubiquitination-like reactions are key to autophagic vesicle membrane elongation as follows: ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 and ATG8 (MAP1LC3 or shortly LC3 in mammals). The first ubiquitination-like reaction results in the covalent conjugation of a Lys-130 residue of the ATG5 protein to a ubiquitin-like protein, ATG12. Following addition of ATG16L1 to the ATG12-conjugated ATG5, a larger complex of around 669–800 kDa forms (6.Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. et al.The role of Atg proteins in autophagosome formation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 107-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). The ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex serves as an E3-like enzyme for the second ubiquitylation-like reaction. Here, the LC3 protein is covalently attached to a lipid molecule, generally to a phosphatidylethanolamine contributing to the elongation of autophagic membranes (7.Ohsumi Y. Mizushima N. et al.Two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems essential for autophagy.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 8.Hanada T. Noda N.N. Satomi Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 37298-37302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Conversion of the free cytosolic form of LC3 (LC3-I) to the lipid-conjugated form (LC3-II) leads to its localization to dot-like autophagosome structures in the cytosol and changes its mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (9.Kabeya Y.

ATG5 and LC3 conjugations systems are required for the canonical autophagy pathway to proceed, and abnormalities result in autophagy defects (10.Mizushima N.

In this study, we describe RACK1 (receptor-activated C-kinase 1, GNB2L1), a WD40 repeat protein with a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, as an interaction partner of ATG5 and a novel autophagy protein. RACK1 was originally characterized as a scaffold/adaptor protein that binds to protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (17.Csukai M. Chen C.H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. et al.The coatomer protein β′-COP, a selective binding protein (RACK) for protein kinase Cepsilon.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Since then, several non-PKC partners of RACK1 were described as well, and the protein was involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and protein translation (18.Li J.J. Xie D. et al.RACK1, a versatile hub in cancer.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Here, we showed that RACK1-ATG5 interaction was regulated by autophagy-inducing signals, namely starvation and mTOR inhibition. Importantly, we provide evidence that RACK1 protein itself and the RACK1-ATG5 interaction were indispensable for autophagy induction. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic approaches, we mapped signaling events regulating RACK1-ATG5 interaction downstream to the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway. Therefore, our data show that RACK1 is a new and dynamic component of the core autophagy machinery. To discover novel ATG5 interactors and autophagy-related proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using ATG5 as a bait. At least three different clones of RACK1 (GNB2L1) were found to interact with the autophagy protein. The results of the Y2H screen will be described in detail elsewhere. 10S. Erbil and D. Gozuacik, manuscript in preparation. To confirm the interaction, we cloned full-length RACK1 cDNA into a mammalian expression vector. Following overexpression experiments in HEK293T cells, we could show that immunoprecipitated ATG5 could pull down the RACK1 protein (Fig. 1A). Conversely, RACK1 immunoprecipitation resulted in the pulldown of ATG5 (Fig. 1B). We could also confirm the interaction between the endogenous proteins in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Moreover, we could validate that the two proteins interacted directly in GST pulldown in vitro binding assays using recombinant proteins (Fig. 1E). Finally, examination of cells using confocal microscopy under basal fed conditions (culture in DMEM plus 10% FBS) showed that both proteins were partially colocalized in cytoplasmic dots (Fig. 1, F and G). All these data indicated that RACK1 is a novel ATG5-interacting protein. To further confirm the ATG5-RACK1 interaction, we performed gel filtration experiments with endogenous protein extracts using a gel filtration column with a separation range between 5 and 5000 kDa. In line with the published data (12.Mizushima N. Kuma A. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto A. Matsubae M. Takao T. Natsume T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. et al.Mouse Apg16L, a novel WD-repeat protein, targets to the autophagic isolation membrane with the Apg12-Apg5 conjugate.J.

Endogenous RACK1 protein was mostly absent in ATG12-5-16- containing fractions under fed conditions in HEK293T (Fig. 2A, CNT) and Neuro2A (N2A) (Fig. 2B, CNT) cells. Importantly, upon autophagy activation using an mTOR inhibitor, torin 1 (Fig. 2, A and B), the amount of RACK1 protein that was recovered in fractions containing the ATG12-5-16 complex was significantly increased. Tri-SILAC labeling and LC-MS/MS analysis was performed following immunoprecipitation of a FLAG-tagged ATG5 protein from cells. Using this technique, we could confirm ATG5-RACK1 interaction under autophagy-stimulating conditions (Fig. 2I). Immunoprecipitation assays supported the data as well. Indeed, the RACK1-ATG5 interaction was prominently increased following treatment of cells with mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or torin 1 (Rapa, Torin, Fig. 3, A and C). Starvation of cells stimulated the interaction between two proteins as well (Stv, Fig. 3, B and C). To check the intracellular localization of RACK1-ATG5 interaction following autophagy activation, we performed confocal microscopy analyses. Treatment of cells with rapamycin or torin 1, or starvation led to an increase in the number of dot-like structures where ATG5 and RACK1 colocalized (Fig. 3D) Moreover, RACK1-positive dots colocalized with the autophagosome marker LC3 (Fig. 3E), indicating that these structures truly represent autophagosomes (20.Shibutani S.T. Yoshimori T. et al.A current perspective of autophagosome biogenesis.Cell Res. 2014; 24: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Interaction of RACK1 with an autophagy-related protein complex and in an autophagy stimulus-dependent manner indicated that RACK1 could be an important component of autophagy regulation. Alternatively, RACK1 could be an autophagy target that was recruited to autophagosomes through its interaction with autophagy proteins. To determine the importance of RACK1 in autophagy mechanisms, we knocked down RACK1 using specific siRNAs and quantified autophagy activation levels using LC3 dot quantification analyses. In cells transfected with a control siRNA (CNT siRNA), mTOR inhibition or starvation strongly induced autophagy (around 4–5 times basal levels). Strikingly, knockdown of RACK1 under the same conditions significantly attenuated autophagy induction by these stimuli (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, knockdown of RACK1 prevented LC3-II formation and led to an accumulation of LC3-I in immunoblots. In line with this, p62 degradation that was observed in extracts from CNT siRNA-transfected cells was abolished following RACK1 down-regulation (Fig. 4A). Under these conditions, addition of bafilomycin A (an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion blocking autolysosomal degradation) led to LC3-II accumulation in controls and could block p62 degradation. In contrast, bafilomycin A did not cause further p62 or LC3-II accumulation in extracts from cells with RACK1 knockdown (Fig. 4A). All these results indicate that RACK1 is involved in upstream stages before autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autolysosome formation. To detect whether RACK1 could be an autophagy target, we stimulated autophagy using rapamycin or starvation in the absence or presence of translation inhibitor cycloheximide or bafilomycin A, and we checked endogenous RACK1 protein levels (Fig. 4, C and D). None of these treatments resulted in RACK1 degradation even at longer incubation times (24-h rapamycin treatment or 8-h starvation), and independent of cycloheximide treatment, bafilomycin A treatment did not result in significant RACK1 accumulation. Therefore, RACK1 itself is not degraded by autophagy, but it is required for autophagy induction by classical autophagy stimuli, i.e. mTOR inhibition and starvation. Because inhibition of mTOR resulted in an increase in RACK1-ATG5 interaction, we wondered whether RACK1-ATG5 interaction was regulated by mTOR itself or proteins that function downstream to mTOR. We overexpressed mTOR protein and checked RACK1-ATG5 interaction in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Under these conditions, we observed that overexpression of the mTOR kinase resulted in a decrease in RACK1-ATG5 interaction (Fig. 5A). In line with data obtained using chemical inhibitors, knockdown of mTOR using specific shRNAs resulted in an increase in RACK1-ATG5 interaction (Fig. 5B). p70S6 kinase is a major serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream to mTOR. To check whether p70S6K played a role in the regulation of RACK1-ATG5 interaction, we first overexpressed a wild-type kinase (21.Schalm S.S. Blenis J. et al.Identification of a conserved motif required for mTOR signaling.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 632-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of the kinase led to the dissociation of RACK1 from ATG5 (Fig. 5C). To further confirm that p70S6K protein itself was necessary for the observed effects on the interaction, we transfected cells with specific siRNAs. Indeed, knockdown of p70S6K promoted association of RACK1 with its partner ATG5 (Fig. 5D). All these results showed that RACK1-ATG5 interaction is regulated by mTOR in a p70S6K-dependent manner. In a study searching for S6 kinase targets using a phospho-proteomics screen, Jastrzebski et al. (22.Jastrzebski K. Hannan K.M. House C.M. Hung S.S. Pearson R.B. Hannan R.D. et al.A phospho-proteomic screen identifies novel S6K1 and mTORC1 substrates revealing additional complexity in the signaling network regulating cell growth.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found that four serine or threonine residues in RXX(S/T) consensus sequences on RACK1 could be phosphorylated in a rapamycin-sensitive and S6 kinase-dependent manner. When we compared RACK1 amino acid sequences from different organisms from yeast to man, we observed that three of these consensus sequences were highly conserved (consensus sequences containing residues Thr-39, Ser-63, and Thr-128) (Fig. 6A). We have mutated these Ser/Thr residues to alanine mimicking the dephosphorylated state (Fig. 6B), or to aspartic acid mimicking the phosphorylated state. We then performed ATG5 immunoprecipitation assays and checked its interaction with wild-type (WT) or alanine mutant RACK1 proteins (T39A, S63A, or T128A mutants). As shown in Fig. 6C, although the interaction of ATG5 was prominently increased with RACK1 T39A and T128A mutants, S63A mutation completely abolished RACK1-ATG5 binding. RACK1 Ser-63 residue is located in the WD40 repeat 2 region (Fig. 7A). We used docking and MD simulations to decipher molecular mechanisms of the interaction between RACK1 and ATG5, and particularly the role of Ser-63 in this interaction. Haddock (High Ambiguity-Driven protein-protein docking) is among the most widely used protein-protein docking algorithms. The tool proved itself for prediction of structures of unknown protein-protein complexes. Using that tool, RACK1-ATG5 was modeled, and the residues found within 3 Å of the other subunit were selected as the binding interface (Fig. 7B, ATG5 residues are in green and RACK1 are in yellow). The predicted protein-protein complex structure was found to possess a network of salt bridge interactions that were formed by Asp-4–His-62, Asp-6–Lys-38, Asp-163–His-64, of which negatively charged aspartic acids belong to ATG5, and positively charged residues (Lys and His) belong to RACK1 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, the backbone amide group of Ser-63 in RACK1 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the Oδ of Asp-6 in ATG5 (Fig. 7C). Along with this direct involvement of Ser-63 in RACK1-ATG5 interactions, Ser-63 might indirectly contribute to salt bridge interactions by taking part in positioning the histidines (62 and 64) of RACK1. Overall, the data presented here unveil a network of interactions in which a pivotal role for Ser-63 might be suggested. Further structural information about the role of Ser-63 of RACK1 was collected from MD simulations of the native Ser-63 or S63A and S63D mutant complexes. The r.m.s.d. of backbone atoms of the complex converged to a plateau and oscillated less than the 2 Å range, suggesting equilibration of the protein complexes (Fig. 7G). Moreover, the simulation data showed that S63A mutation led to the loss of Asp-6-Lys-38 interaction, whereas the native and S63D complexes possessed the Asp-6-Lys-38 interaction (Fig. 7, D–F). In line with these observations, fluctuations of ATG5 in the S63A complex have increased, particularly for the regions 32–36 and 50–54, that were also found at the binding interface (Fig. 7H). Increased mobility of the interface in the S63A mutant indicated destabilization of the complex compared with native Ser-63 and S63D complexes (Fig. 7H). Overall, computational analyses confirmed the role played by Ser-63 and also provided insights into the molecular machinery of RACK1-ATG5 interaction. To check whether RACK1-ATG5 interaction is important for autophagy activation or not, we expressed wild-type, S63A, or S63D mutant RACK1 N2A cells (Fig. 8, A–D), and we quantified autophagy activation by torin 1 and starvation in the absence or presence of bafilomycin A. LC3 dot quantification under control conditions (pcDNA3 expression) showed that torin 1 and starvation led to a strong and clear autophagy activation (2 to 3 times basal level) (Fig. 8, A–D). Interestingly, although wild-type RACK1 or S63D mutant expression further increased the amplitude of torin 1 or starvation-induced autophagy and LC3-II formation on immunoblots, expression of the S63A mutant significantly and reproducibly inhibited LC3 dot numbers in cells and LC3-II formation in blots (Fig. 8, A–D). Bafilomycin A treatment under these conditions did not prominently lead to accumulation of LC3 dots, yet in blots an increase in LC3-II levels was observed in wild-type RACK1 or S63D mutants expressing cell extracts. No significant LC3-II accumulation was observed in the S63A mutant expressing cells following bafilomycin A treatment, underlining the fact that autophagosome formation was perturbed by this mutant. We also tested whether wild-type RACK1 or its mutants could rescue autophagic activity in cells with RACK1 knockdown. However, the wild-type protein or the S63D mutant could reverse autophagy inhibition that was observed following RACK1 knockdown, and the S63A mutant did not show the same effect (Fig. 9, B and C). Inhibition of lysosomal protease activity with E64d/pepstatin A led to an accumulation of LC3-II in wild-type protein or the S63D mutant-transfected cells but not in cells expressing the S63A mutant (Fig. 9B). Therefore, the S63A mutant that does bind ATG5 was unable to rescue an autophagy defect caused by endogenous RACK1 down-regulation. These results clearly showed that RACK1-ATG5 interaction is required for autophagy induction by classical autophagy inducing stimuli, i.e. mTOR inhibition and starvation. In this study, we showed that RACK1 protein is an interaction partner of the key autophagy protein ATG5. We confirmed this observation using various independent techniques, i.e. yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation tests, confocal microscopy, SILAC analyses, and gel filtration assays, and we validated our results in three different cell lines (HEK293T, MEF, and Neuro2A). In fact, we showed that endogenous RACK1 was included in a previously reported autophagy-related 669–800-kDa protein complex containing ATG12-5-16 (19.Ishibashi K. Fujita N. Kanno E. Omori H. Yoshimori T. Itoh T. Fukuda M. et al.Atg16L2, a novel isoform of mammalian Atg16L that is not essential for canonical autophagy despite forming an Atg12–5-16L2 complex.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 1500-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Importantly, RACK1-ATG5 interaction was a dynamic one. Treatment of cells with classical autophagy inducers rapamycin and torin 1 (mTOR inhibitors) and starvation stimulated RACK1-ATG5 interaction in cytoplasmic dot-like structures, indicating that under autophagy-inducing conditions, the interaction occurred on ATG5 containing isolation membranes. Indeed in previous proteomics analyses, RACK1 was detected in isolated LC3-positive autophagic vesicles (23.Dengjel J. Hoyer-Hansen M. Nielsen M.O. Eisenberg T. Harder L.M. Schandorff S. Farkas T. Kirkegaard T. Becker A.C. Schroeder S. Vanselow K. Lundberg E. Nielsen M.M. Kristensen A.R. Akimov V. et al.Identification of autophagosome-associated proteins and regulators by quantitative proteomic analysis and genetic screens.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11 (M111.014035)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that RACK1 protein itself could be an autophagy target, we performed kinetic autophagy experiments in the absence or presence of the protein translation inhibitor cycloheximide and bafilomycin A. We observed no significant degradation even at latest time points. Therefore, RACK1 is not an autophagy target protein, and its association with the autophagy machinery should have a functional role. In line with this idea, we observed that RACK1 was required for autophagic vesicle formation, and knockdown of RACK1 attenuated formation of LC3-positive autophagosomes. Interaction of RACK1 with ATG5 was a key event in autophagy regulation. A mutant RACK1 that could no longer interact with ATG5 (the S63A mutant) blocked autophagy induced by mTOR inhibitors or starvation. Data presented here showed that RACK1 is an essential component of the autophagy machinery, and its interaction with ATG5 is a critical event that recruits it to the autophagy pathway. The mTOR signaling pathway is one of the major regulators of autophagy. mTOR kinase complexes sense various upstream stimuli (ATP or amino acid depletion, growth factor deprivation, etc.) and serve as master regulators of cellular anabolic and catabolic pathways. For example, under nutrient- and growth factor-rich conditions, activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) results in the phosphorylation and activation of the p70S6K and eIF4BP (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4E binding protein), stimulating protein synthesis and cell survival (24.Chantranupong L. Wolfson R.L. Sabatini D.M. et al.Nutrient-sensing mechanisms across evolution.Cell. 2015; 161: 67-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of mTOR strongly activates autophagic protein degradation. In our system, overexpression of the mTOR kinase or p70S6K led to the dissociation of the RACK1-ATG5 complex. In addition to data obtained using mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and torin 1, knockdown of the mTOR kinase itself or p70S6K stimulated RACK1-ATG5 association. Our results indicate that RACK1-ATG5 association control is one of the mechanisms used by the mTORC1-p70S6 kinase pathway to regulate autophagy. In fact, RACK1 Ser-63 and other residues, including Thr-39 and Thr-128, were previously suggested to be targets of S6 kinase isoforms (22.Jastrzebski K. Hannan K.M. House C.M. Hung S.S. Pearson R.B. Hannan R.D. et al.A phospho-proteomic screen identifies novel S6K1 and mTORC1 substrates revealing additional complexity in the signaling network regulating cell growth.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Conversion of Ser-63 to alanine (S63A mutation) on RACK1, mimicking a non-phosphorylated form, was sufficient to abolish RACK1-ATG5 interaction and to inhibit mTOR-related or starvation-induced autophagy. Moreover, the S63A mutant could not rescue autophagy inhibition following RACK1 knockdown. On the one hand, T39A/T39D or T128A/T128D mutants did not dissolve the RACK1-ATG5 complex. On the other hand, RACK1 T39A and T128A mutations did result in an increased interaction. Yet, different from the S63A mutant, expression of T39A and T128A mutants or their phospho-mimicking aspartic acid (T39D and T128D) forms did not lead to any change in the autophagic activity. 11S. Erbil and D. Gozuacik, unpublished results. These results indicated that, an optimum level of RACK1-ATG5 interaction is necessary and sufficient for autophagy. Our results showed that both mTOR and p70S6K proteins were necessary for the regulation of RACK1-ATG5 interaction, and overexpression of kinase-active mTOR or p70S6K proteins had an inhibitory effect on complex formation. Nevertheless, our studies using mutants did not confirm autophagy-related relevance of a direct phosphorylation of RACK1 on previously reported p70S6K putative target residues (22.Jastrzebski K.

The analysis included adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation newly initiated on rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or warfarin between November 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, with a baseline CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2, two or more non-valvular atrial fibrillation diagnosis codes (427.31), and ≥6 months' continuous medical and pharmacy benefit enrollment before oral anticoagulant initiation. Propensity score matching was performed to match patients receiving rivaroxaban with those receiving dabigatran (1:1) and warfarin (1:1). Patients were followed until the first event of inpatient death, end of continuous enrollment, or end of study period. Medication persistence was defined as absence of a refill gap of >60 days. Discontinuation was defined as no additional refill for >90 days and through to end of follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) of oral anticoagulant persistence and discontinuation were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models. In total, 3,2634 patients were included (n = 10878/oral anticoagulant group). Rivaroxaban was associated with better persistence than both dabigatran (HR 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.67) and warfarin (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.59-0.64) and lower discontinuation than dabigatran (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.58-0.64) and warfarin (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68). Real-world analysis of oral anticoagulant use may reveal whether the relatively high persistence/low discontinuation demonstrated for rivaroxaban translates into lower rates of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2465870777,"Research conducted following natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes is crucial for improving relief interventions. Such research, however, poses ethical, methodological and logistical challenges for researchers. Oversight of disaster research also poses challenges for research ethics committees (RECs), in part due to the rapid turnaround needed to initiate research after a disaster. Currently, there is limited knowledge available about how RECs respond to and appraise disaster research. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the experiences of REC members who had reviewed disaster research conducted in low- or middle-income countries.We used interpretive description methodology and conducted in-depth interviews with 15 respondents. Respondents were chairs, members, advisors, or coordinators from 13 RECs, including RECs affiliated with universities, governments, international organizations, a for-profit REC, and an ad hoc committee established during a disaster. Interviews were analyzed inductively using constant comparative techniques.Through this process, three elements were identified as characterizing effective and high-quality review: timeliness, responsiveness and rigorousness. To ensure timeliness, many RECs rely on adaptations of review procedures for urgent protocols. Respondents emphasized that responsive review requires awareness of and sensitivity to the particularities of disaster settings and disaster research. Rigorous review was linked with providing careful assessment of ethical considerations related to the research, as well as ensuring independence of the review process.Both the frequency of disasters and the conduct of disaster research are on the rise. Ensuring effective and high quality review of disaster research is crucial, yet challenges, including time pressures for urgent protocols, exist for achieving this goal. Adapting standard REC procedures may be necessary. However, steps should be taken to ensure that ethics review of disaster research remains diligent and thorough."
https://openalex.org/W2463987807,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) plays a key role in the regulation of skeletal muscle substrate utilization. IL-6 is produced in skeletal muscle during exercise in a duration dependent manner and has been reported to increase whole body fatty acid oxidation, muscle glucose uptake and decrease PDHa activity in skeletal muscle of fed mice. The aim of the present study was to examine whether muscle IL-6 contributes to exercise-induced PDH regulation in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) mice and floxed littermate controls (control) completed a single bout of treadmill exercise for 10, 60 or 120 min, with rested mice of each genotype serving as basal controls. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was overall higher (P<0.05) in IL-6 MKO than control mice during the 120 min of treadmill exercise, while RER decreased during exercise independent of genotype. AMPK and ACC phosphorylation also increased with exercise independent of genotype. PDHa activity was in control mice higher (P<0.05) at 10 and 60 min of exercise than at rest but remained unchanged in IL-6 MKO mice. In addition, PDHa activity was higher (P<0.05) in IL-6 MKO than control mice at rest and 60 min of exercise. Neither PDH phosphorylation nor acetylation could explain the genotype differences in PDHa activity. Together, this provides evidence that skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes to the regulation of PDH at rest and during prolonged exercise and suggests that muscle IL-6 normally dampens carbohydrate utilization during prolonged exercise via effects on PDH."
https://openalex.org/W2197085016,"The extent to which federal investment in research crowds out or decreases incentives for investment from other funding sources remains an open question. Scholarship on research funding has focused on the relationship between federal and industry or, more comprehensively, non-federal funding without disentangling the other sources of research support that include nonprofit organizations and state and local governments. This paper extends our understanding of academic research support by considering the relationships between federal and non-federal funding sources provided by the National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development Survey. We examine whether federal research investment serves as a complement or substitute for state and local government, nonprofit, and industry research investment using the population of research-active academic science fields at U.S. doctoral granting institutions. We use a system of two equations that instruments with prior levels of both federal and non-federal funding sources and accounts for time-invariant academic institution-field effects through first differencing. We estimate that a 1% increase in federal research funding is associated with a 0.411% increase in nonprofit research funding, a 0.217% increase in state and local research funding, and a 0.468% increase in industry research funding, respectively. Results indicate that federal funding plays a fundamental role in inducing complementary investments from other funding sources, with impacts varying across academic division, research capacity, and institutional control."

A cross-sectional survey was used to assess a sample of 448 GPs and 412 general nurses from 90 township hospitals located in Heilongjiang province, China. Results revealed that workers exposed to physical, psychological or both WPV types had a strong opinion about the necessity of improving diagnosis/treatment competence, developing violence prevention guidelines and plans, using protective equipment, and reinforcing staff by providing back-up support. The last two strategies were also selected by tertiary hospital workers in our previous study. In addition, workers with high anxiety selected the following prevention strategies as most effective: improving doctor-patient communication skills; installing cameras on wards; keeping work areas bright; improvements in violence reporting, statistics, and interventions; security patrols in the key departments; reinforcing staff; and correcting inaccurate media perspectives and reports. The last four strategies were also selected by tertiary hospital workers. All respondents expected to receive organisational and social support. In conclusion, these prevention strategies should be tailored to the different requirements of specific populations. Furthermore, it is necessary for organisations, the public, and policymakers to provide powerful support in WPV prevention."

In this study, we designed a novel predictive model based on an artificial neural network with a deep structure for predicting odor impression utilizing the mass spectra of chemicals, and we conducted a series of computational analyses to evaluate its performance. Feature vectors extracted from the original high-dimensional space using two autoencoders equipped with both input and output layers in the model are used to build a mapping function from the feature space of mass spectra to the feature space of sensory data.

The basidiomycetous yeast Pseudozyma tsukubaensis produces diastereomer type of MEL-B, which contains 4-O-β-D-mannopyranosyl-(2R,3S)-erythritol (R-form) as the sugar moiety. In this respect it differs from conventional type of MELs, which contain 4-O-β-D-mannopyranosyl-(2S,3R)-erythritol (S-form) as the sugar moiety. While the biosynthetic gene cluster for conventional type of MELs has been previously identified in Ustilago maydis and Pseudozyma antarctica, the genetic basis for MEL biosynthesis in P. tsukubaensis is unknown. Here, we identified a gene cluster involved in MEL biosynthesis in P. tsukubaensis. Among these genes, PtEMT1, which encodes erythritol/mannose transferase, had greater than 69% identity with homologs from strains in the genera Ustilago, Melanopsichium, Sporisorium and Pseudozyma. However, phylogenetic analysis placed PtEMT1p in a separate clade from the other proteins. To investigate the function of PtEMT1, we introduced the gene into a P. antarctica mutant strain, ΔPaEMT1, which lacks MEL biosynthesis ability owing to the deletion of PaEMT1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we identified the biosynthetic product as MEL-A with altered sugar conformation. These results indicate that PtEMT1p catalyzes the sugar conformation of MELs. This is the first report of a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of diastereomer type of MEL."
https://openalex.org/W2460921239,"Suitability of plant tissues as food for insects varies from plant to plant. In lepidopteran insects, fitness is largely dependent on the host-finding ability of the females. Existing studies have suggested that polyphagous lepidopterans preferentially select certain host plant species for oviposition. However, the mechanisms for host recognition and selection have not been fully elucidated. For the polyphagous yellow peach moth Conogethes punctiferalis, we explored the effect of chestnut cultivar on the performance and fitness and addressed the mechanisms of plant-volatile-mediated host recognition. By carrying out laboratory experiments and field investigation on four chestnut Castanea mollissima cultivars (Huaihuang, Huaijiu, Yanhong, and Shisheng), we found that C. punctiferalis females preferentially select Huaijiu for oviposition and infestation, and caterpillars fed on Huaijiu achieved slightly greater fitness than those fed on the other three chestnut cultivars, indicating that Huaijiu was a better suitable host for C. punctiferalis. Plant volatiles played important roles in host recognition by C. punctiferalis. All seven chestnut volatile compounds, α-pinene, camphene, β-thujene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, 3-carene, and nonanal, could trigger EAG responses in C. punctiferalis. The ubiquitous plant terpenoids, α-pinene, camphene and β-pinene, and their specific combination at concentrations and proportions similar to the emissions from the four chestnut cultivars, was sufficient to elicit host recognition behavior of female C. punctiferalis. Nonanal and a mixture containing nonanal, that mimicked the emission of C. punctiferalis infested chestnut fruits, caused avoidance response. The outcome demonstrates the effects of chestnut cultivars on the performance of C. punctiferalis and reveals the preference-performance relationship between C. punctiferalis adults and their offspring. The observed olfactory plasticity in the plant-volatile-mediated host recognition may be important for the forming of the relationship between yellow peach moth and chestnuts since it allows the polyphagous herbivores to adjust to variation in volatile emission from their host plants."

To select superior Salix varieties that adapt to wide saline areas, it is of paramount importance to understand and identify the mechanisms of salt-tolerance at the level of the whole genome. Here, we describe a high-density genetic linkage map of S. matsudana that represents a good coverage of the Salix genome. An intraspecific F1 hybrid population was established by crossing the salt-sensitive “Yanjiang” variety as the female parent with the salt-tolerant “9901” variety as the male parent. This population, along with its parents, was genotyped by specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), leading to 277,333 high-quality SLAF markers. By marker analysis, we found that both the parents and offspring were tetraploid. The mean sequencing depth was 53.20-fold for “Yanjiang”, 47.41-fold for “9901”, and 11.02-fold for the offspring. Of the SLAF markers detected, 42,321 are polymorphic with sufficient quality for map construction. The final genetic map was constructed using 6,737 SLAF markers, covering 38 linkage groups (LGs).

In this study, we investigated the regulation of TBX15 expression in human cancer cells, by analyzing the regulatory function of a 5’-distal conserved region of TBX15. Bisulfite sequencing showed high methylation of the CpG island contained in this region that was not correlated with TBX15 mRNA levels, in the cancer cell lines analyzed; however, after 5-aza-dC treatment of TPC-1 cells an increase of TBX15 expression was observed. We also found a significant response of TBX15 to TNF-α activation of the NF-κB pathway using five cancer cell lines, and similar results were obtained when NF-κB was activated with PMA/ionomycin. Next, by luciferase reporter assays, we identified the TBX15 regulatory region containing two functional NF-κB binding sites with response to NF-κBp65, mapping on the -3302 and -3059 positions of the TBX15 gene. Moreover, a direct interaction of NF-κBp65 with one of the two NF-κB binding sites was indicated by ChIP assays. In summary, we provide novel data showing that NF-κB signaling up-regulates TBX15 expression in cancer cells. Furthermore, the link between TBX15 and NF-κB found in this study may be important to understand cancer and development processes."
https://openalex.org/W2467690514,"We report the carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope records of three modern Tridacna derasa shells from Ishigaki-jima, southwestern Japan. The high-resolution δ13C profiles of samples from the inner shell layer on cross-sections fall within similar narrow ranges and display no regular variations or trends, such as an ontogenetic trend or abrupt short-term drops likely to be related to reproductive activity. This suggests that the calcification site of this species is not likely affected by photosynthetic CO2 uptake or CO2 incorporation during respiration. The δ18O profiles show distinct seasonal cycles. The intraspecific variability in the δ18O values is small in parts of the shell precipitated in the adult stage, but is not negligible in the juvenile and senescent stages. The differences in the monthly and seasonally resolved δ18O values among shells are less than 0.51‰ and 0.76‰, respectively. The shell δ18O values are nearly identical or close to the δ18O values for aragonite precipitated in oxygen isotope equilibrium with ambient seawater (δ18OEA). The largest differences between the shell δ18O and δ18OEA values calculated from the monthly and seasonally resolved data correspond to an overestimate of the seawater temperature by as much as 1.7°C and 2.3°C, respectively. However, these differences are smaller in the adult stage (<0.25‰) than in the other stages. This small difference allows an accurate reconstruction of the seawater temperature with an error of <1.1°C. Consequently, we recommend that multiple shell records be obtained because of the non-negligible intraspecific variations in their δ18O values. Growth banding, composed of alternating narrow white bands and wide light-grey bands, is discernible on cross-sections of the inner shell layer. The δ18Oshell data indicate that they were formed in winter and the other seasons, respectively."

To date, however, analyses considering different types of meta-analyses as well as the potential dependence of bootstrapping success on the decision domain, the level of expertise of the human judge, and the criterion for what constitutes an accurate decision have been missing from the literature. In this study, we addressed these research gaps by conducting a meta-analysis of lens model studies. We compared the results of a traditional (bare-bones) meta-analysis with findings of a meta-analysis of the success of bootstrap models corrected for various methodological artifacts. In line with previous studies, we found that bootstrapping was more successful than human judgment. Furthermore, bootstrapping was more successful in studies with an objective decision criterion than in studies with subjective or test score criteria. We did not find clear evidence that the success of bootstrapping depended on the decision domain (e.g., education or medicine) or on the judge’s level of expertise (novice or expert). Correction of methodological artifacts increased the estimated success of bootstrapping, suggesting that previous analyses without artifact correction (i.e., traditional meta-analyses) may have underestimated the value of bootstrapping models."

The human EAG1 (hEAG1) channel is remarkably sensitive to inhibition by intracellular calcium (Ca(2+) i) through binding of Ca(2+)-calmodulin to three sites adjacent to the eagD and cNBHD. Here, we show that the eagD and cNBHD interact to modulate Ca(2+)-calmodulin as well as voltage-dependent gating. Sustained elevation of Ca(2+) i resulted in an initial profound inhibition of hEAG1 currents, which was followed by a phase when current amplitudes partially recovered, but activation gating was slowed and shifted to depolarized potentials. Deletion of either the eagD or cNBHD abolished the inhibition by Ca(2+) i However, deletion of just the PAS-cap resulted in a >15-fold potentiation in response to elevated Ca(2+) i Mutations of residues at the interface between the eagD and cNBHD have been linked to human cancer. Glu-600 on the cNBHD, when substituted with residues with a larger volume, resulted in hEAG1 currents that were profoundly potentiated by Ca(2+) i in a manner similar to the ΔPAS-cap mutant. These findings provide the first evidence that eagD and cNBHD interactions are regulating Ca(2+)-dependent gating and indicate that the binding of the PAS-cap with the cNBHD is required for the closure of the channels upon CaM binding."
https://openalex.org/W2473490221,"Structured patterns of global visual motion called optic flow provide crucial information about an observer's speed and direction of self-motion and about the geometry of the environment. Brain and behavioral responses to optic flow undergo considerable postnatal maturation, but relatively little brain imaging evidence describes the time course of development in motion processing systems in early to middle childhood, a time when psychophysical data suggest that there are changes in sensitivity. To fill this gap, electroencephalographic (EEG) responses were recorded in 4- to 8-year-old children who viewed three time-varying optic flow patterns (translation, rotation, and radial expansion/contraction) at three different speeds (2, 4, and 8 deg/s). Modulations of global motion coherence evoked coherent EEG responses at the first harmonic that differed by flow pattern and responses at the third harmonic and dot update rate that varied by speed. Pattern-related responses clustered over right lateral channels while speed-related responses clustered over midline channels. Both children and adults show widespread responses to modulations of motion coherence at the second harmonic that are not selective for pattern or speed. The results suggest that the developing brain segregates the processing of optic flow pattern from speed and that an adult-like pattern of neural responses to optic flow has begun to emerge by early to middle childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2473657539,"Background The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic values of three breast tumor markers (i.e., CEA, CA153 and CA125) in milk and nipple discharge in the prediction of different breast diseases diagnoses. Methods Three hundred thirty-six patients (96 breast cancer and 240 benign disease patients) with nipple discharge and a control group of 56 healthy parturient participants were enrolled in the present study. Nipple discharge samples were preoperatively collected from the patients, and milk was collected from the colostrum of the parturient participants. The samples were assayed for the CEA, CA153 and CA125 levels. Cutoff values were determined for the detection of breast diseases using ROC curves. Results The levels of CEA, CA153 and CA125 were significantly different between the nipple discharge and the milk (all ps < 0.001). In the nipple discharge, the CEA and CA153 levels in the breast cancer group were significantly greater than those in the benign group (all ps < 0.001), and cutoff values of 263.3 ng/mL and 1235.3 U/mL, respectively, were established. However, the expression of CA125 did not differ significantly between the breast cancer and benign groups. Conclusion Differences in the apparent expression levels of CEA, CA153 and CA125 in patients with nipple discharge and healthy persons were validated. The present data suggest that CEA and CA153 might potentially be useful in the differential diagnoses of benign tumors and breast cancer. CA125 did not seem to be useful for breast cancer detection."
https://openalex.org/W2463420446,"Background Accurately characterizing children’s body mass index (BMI) trajectories and studying their determinants is a statistical challenge. There is a need to identify early public health measures for obesity prevention. We describe a method that allows studies of the determinants of height, weight and BMI growth up to five years of age. We illustrated this method using maternal smoking during pregnancy as one of the early-life factors that is potentially involved in prenatal programming of obesity. Methods Individual height and weight trajectories were fitted using the Jenss-Bayley model on 28,381 and 30,515 measurements, respectively, from 1,666 children to deduce BMI trajectories. We assessed global associations between smoking and growth trajectories and cross-sectional associations at specific ages. Results Children exposed in late pregnancy had a 0.24 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.41) higher BMI at 5 years of age compared with non-exposed children. Although the BMIs of children exposed during late pregnancy became significantly higher compared with those of non-exposed children from 2 years onwards, the trajectories began to diverge during the first weeks of life. Conclusion Our method is relevant for studies on the relationships between individual-level exposures and the dynamics and shapes of BMI growth during childhood, including key features such as instantaneous growth velocities and the age or BMI value at the BMI infancy peak that benefit from the monotonic pattern of height and weight growth."
https://openalex.org/W2473716045,"F-box protein is a core component of the ubiquitin E3 ligase SCF complex and is involved in the gibberellin (GA) signaling pathway. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of GA signaling in wheat, three homologous GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF2 genes, TaGID2s, were isolated from the Chinese Spring wheat variety. A subcellular localization assay in onion epidermal cells and Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts showed that TaGID2s are localized in the nuclei. The expression profiles using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that TaGID2s were downregulated by GA3. The interaction between TaGID2s and TSK1 (homologous to ASK1) in yeast indicated that TaGID2s might function as a component of an E3 ubiquitin-ligase SCF complex. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that a GA-independent interaction occurred between three TaGID2s and RHT-A1a, RHT-B1a, and RHT-D1a. Furthermore, TaGID2s interact with most RHT-1s, such as RHT-B1h, RHT-B1i, RHT-D1e, RHT-D1f, etc., but cannot interact with RHT-B1b or RHT-B1e, which have a stop codon in the DELLA motif, resulting in a lack of a GRAS domain. In addition, RHT-B1k has a frame-shift mutation in the VHIID motif leading to loss of the LHRII motif in the GRAS domain and RHT-D1h has a missense mutation in the LHRII motif. These results indicate that TaGID2s, novel positive regulators of the GA response, recognize RHT-1s in the LHRII motif resulting in poly-ubiquitination and degradation of the DELLA protein."
https://openalex.org/W2473620285,"Opsins are photosensitive proteins catalyzing light-dependent processes across the tree of life. For both microbial (type 1) and metazoan (type 2) opsins, photosensing depends upon covalent interaction between a retinal chromophore and a conserved lysine residue. Despite recent discoveries of potential opsin homologs lacking this residue, phylogenetic dispersal and functional significance of these abnormal sequences have not yet been investigated. We report discovery of a large group of putatively non-retinal binding opsins, present in a number of fungal and microbial genomes and comprising nearly 30% of opsins in the Halobacteriacea, a model clade for opsin photobiology. We report phylogenetic analyses, structural modeling, genomic context analysis and biochemistry, to describe the evolutionary relationship of these recently described proteins with other opsins, show that they are expressed and do not bind retinal in a canonical manner. Given these data, we propose a hypothesis that these abnormal opsin homologs may represent a novel family of sensory opsins which may be involved in taxis response to one or more non-light stimuli. If true, this finding would challenge our current understanding of microbial opsins as a light-specific sensory family, and provides a potential analogy with the highly diverse signaling capabilities of the eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), of which metazoan type 2 opsins are a light-specific sub-clade."
https://openalex.org/W2461775754,"Background The medico-economic impact of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poorly documented. Objective To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation in a hypothetical cohort of COPD patients. Methods We used a multi-state Markov model, adopting society’s perspective. Simulated cohorts of French GOLD stage 2 to 4 COPD patients with and without pulmonary rehabilitation were compared in terms of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), disease-related costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses included variations of key model parameters. Principal Findings At the horizon of a COPD patient’s remaining lifetime, pulmonary rehabilitation would result in mean gain of 0.8 QALY, with an over disease-related costs of 14 102 € per patient. The ICER was 17 583 €/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that pulmonary rehabilitation was cost-effective in every scenario (ICER <50 000 €/QALY). Conclusions These results should provide a useful basis for COPD pulmonary rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2466704142,"A popular method for studying the function of a given protein is to generate and characterize a suitable model deficient for its expression. For the prion protein (PrP), best known for its role in several invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases, a natural choice, therefore, would be to undertake such studies with brain samples. We recently documented the surprising observation that PrP deficiency caused a loss or enhancement of NCAM1 polysialylation, dependent on the cell model used. To identify possible causes for this disparity, we set out to systematically investigate the consequence of PrP deficiency on the global proteome in brain tissue and in four distinct cell models. Here we report that PrP deficiency causes robust but surprisingly divergent changes to the global proteomes of cell models but has no discernible impact on the global brain proteome. Amongst >1,500 proteins whose levels were compared in wild-type and PrP-deficient models, members of the MARCKS protein family exhibited pronounced, yet cell model-dependent changes to their steady-state levels. Follow-up experiments revealed that PrP collaborates with members of the MARCKS protein family in its control of NCAM1 polysialylation. We conclude that the physiological function of PrP may be masked in analyses of complex brain samples but its cell-type specific influence on a lipid raft-based NCAM1-related cell biology comes to the fore in investigations of specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2472175918,"Network controllability is an important topic in wide-ranging research fields. However, the relationship between controllability and network structure is poorly understood, although degree heterogeneity is known to determine the controllability. We focus on the size of a minimum dominating set (MDS), a measure of network controllability, and investigate the effect of degree-degree correlation, which is universally observed in real-world networks, on the size of an MDS. We show that disassortativity or negative degree-degree correlation reduces the size of an MDS using analytical treatments and numerical simulation, whereas positive correlations hardly affect the size of an MDS. This result suggests that disassortativity enhances network controllability. Furthermore, apart from the controllability issue, the developed techniques provide new ways of analyzing complex networks with degree-degree correlations."
https://openalex.org/W2472976343,"Albuminuria is a well-known predictor of poor renal and cardiovascular outcomes and associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. The study aimed to evaluate the associations between metabolic characteristics and the presence of albuminuria.This cross-sectional study included 18,384 adult Chinese who participated in health examinations during 2013-2014. Differences in clinical characteristics were compared for microalbuminuria (MAU) and albuminuria, and between genders. Potential risk factors associated with the risk of developing MAU and albuminuria were analyzed using univariate logistic regression. Multiple logistic regression was applied to further identify the independent associations between different levels of risk factors and the presence of MAU and albuminuria. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to determine the discriminatory ability of metabolic risk factors in detecting albuminuria.There were significant gender differences in clinical characteristics according to albuminuria status. Risk for the presence of albuminuria was significantly associated with age, male gender, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), hypertension, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-C) in univariate logistic regression. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the factors significantly associated with the presence of MAU were WC > 90cm, WHtR at 0.6-0.7, hypertension, FPG > 6.1 mmole/L, and TG/HDL-C ratio > 1.6. The optimal cutoffs for risk factors of metabolic syndrome (MetS) to predict albuminuria in males and females were: WC, 90.8 vs. 80.0 cm; WHtR, 0.53 vs. 0.52; MAP, 97.9 vs. 91.9 mmHg; FPG, 5.40 vs. 5.28 mmole/L; and TG/HDL-C, 1.13 vs. 1.08.MetS and all its components were associated with the presence of MAU in a health check-up population in China. Gender specific and optimal cutoffs for MetS components associated with the presence of MAU were determined."
https://openalex.org/W2474750001,"Pregnancies obtained by Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are associated with limited maternal nutrient uptake. Our previous studies shown that in vitro culture of sheep embryos is associated with vascularization defects in their placentae and consequent reduction of embryo growth. Autophagy is a pro-survival cellular mechanism triggered by nutrient insufficiency. Therefore, the goal of our present study was to determine if autophagy is involved in early placental development after transfer of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos. To do this, placentae obtained following transfer of IVP sheep embryos were compared with placentae obtained after natural mating (control—CTR). The placentae were collected on day 20 post-fertilization and post-mating, respectively, and were analyzed using molecular (qPCR), ultrastructural and histological/immunological approaches. Our results show drastically increased autophagy in IVP placentae: high levels of expression (p<0.05) of canonical markers of cellular autophagy and a high proportion of autophagic cells (35.08%; p<0.001) were observed. We conclude that high autophagic activity in IVP placentae can be a successful temporary counterbalance to the retarded vasculogenesis and the reduction of foetal growth observed in pregnancies after transfer of IVP embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2465406215,"This study was performed to investigate the genetic determinants of autosomal recessive congenital cataracts in large consanguineous families.Affected individuals underwent a detailed ophthalmological examination and slit-lamp photographs of the cataractous lenses were obtained. An aliquot of blood was collected from all participating family members and genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells. Initially, a genome-wide scan was performed with genomic DNAs of family PKCC025 followed by exclusion analysis of our familial cohort of congenital cataracts. Protein-coding exons of CRYBB1, CRYBB2, CRYBB3, and CRYBA4 were sequenced bidirectionally. A haplotype was constructed with SNPs flanking the causal mutation for affected individuals in all four families, while the probability that the four familial cases have a common founder was estimated using EM and CHM-based algorithms. The expression of Crybb3 in the developing murine lens was investigated using TaqMan assays.The clinical and ophthalmological examinations suggested that all affected individuals had nuclear cataracts. Genome-wide linkage analysis localized the causal phenotype in family PKCC025 to chromosome 22q with statistically significant two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores. Subsequently, we localized three additional families, PKCC063, PKCC131, and PKCC168 to chromosome 22q. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing identified a missense variation: c.493G>C (p.Gly165Arg) in CRYBB3 that segregated with the disease phenotype in all four familial cases. This variation was not found in ethnically matched control chromosomes, the NHLBI exome variant server, or the 1000 Genomes or dbSNP databases. Interestingly, all four families harbor a unique disease haplotype that strongly suggests a common founder of the causal mutation (p<1.64E-10). We observed expression of Crybb3 in the mouse lens as early as embryonic day 15 (E15), and expression remained relatively steady throughout development.Here, we report a common ancestral mutation in CRYBB3 associated with autosomal recessive congenital cataracts identified in four familial cases of Pakistani origin."

To pursue the possibility that the capsule of Francisella live vaccine strain (LVS) has a structurally unique lipid anchor, we have metabolically labeled Francisella with [14C]acetate to facilitate highly sensitive compositional analysis of capsule-associated lipids. Capsule was purified by two independent methods and yielded similar results. Autoradiographic and immunologic analysis confirmed that this purified material was largely devoid of low molecular weight LPS and of the copious amounts of free lipid A that the Francisellae accumulate. Chemical hydrolysis yielded [14C]-labeled free fatty acids characteristic of Francisella lipid A but with a different molar ratio of 3-OH C18:0 to 3-OH C16:0 and different composition of non-hydroxylated fatty acids (mainly C14:0 rather than C16:0) than that of free Francisella lipid A. Mild acid hydrolysis to induce selective cleavage of KDO-lipid A linkage yielded a [14C]-labeled product that partitioned during Bligh/Dyer extraction and migrated during thin-layer chromatography like lipid A. These findings suggest that the O-antigen capsule of Francisella contains a covalently linked and structurally distinct lipid A species. The presence of a discrete lipid A-like molecule associated with capsule raises the possibility that Francisella selectively exploits lipid A structural heterogeneity to regulate synthesis, transport, and stable bacterial surface association of the O-antigen capsular layer."
https://openalex.org/W2462587930,"Purpose In the present study, we aimed to investigate the frequency of blood brain barrier injury in posterior circulation infarction as demonstrated by the hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) on fluid attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR). Methods From a MRI report database we identified patients with posterior circulation infarction who underwent MRI, including perfusion-weighted images (PWI), within 12 hours after onset and follow-up MRI within 24 hours and analyzed diffusion-weighted images (DWI), PWI, FLAIR, and MR angiography (MRA). On FLAIR images, the presence of HARM was noted by using pre-specified criteria (focal enhancement in the subarachnoid space and/or the ventricles). Results Overall 16 patients (median age of patients 68.5 (IQR 55.5–82.75) years) with posterior circulation infarction were included. Of these, 13 (81.3%) demonstrated PCA occlusion, and 3 (18.7%) patients BA occlusion on MRA. Initial DWI demonstrated ischemic lesions in the thalamus (68.8%), splenium (18.8%), hippocampus (75%), occipital lobe (81.3%), mesencephalon (18.8%), pons (18.8%), and cerebellum (50%). On follow-up MRA recanalization was noted in 10 (62.5%) patients. On follow-up FLAIR images, HARM was observed in 8 (50%) patients. In all of these, HARM was detected remote from the acute ischemic lesion. HARM was more frequently observed in patients with vessel recanalization (p = 0.04), minor infarction growth (p = 0.01), and smaller ischemic lesions on follow-up DWI (p = 0.05). Conclusions HARM is a frequent finding in posterior circulation infarction and associated with vessel recanalization, minor infarction growth as well as smaller infarction volumes in the course. Neuroradiologists should be cognizant of the fact that HARM may be present on short interval follow-up FLAIR images in patients with acute ischemic infarction who initially underwent MRI and received intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents."
https://openalex.org/W2469777882,"A main application for mRNA sequencing (mRNAseq) is determining lists of differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between two or more conditions. Several software packages exist to produce DEGs from mRNAseq data, but they typically yield different DEGs, sometimes markedly so. The underlying probability model used to describe mRNAseq data is central to deriving DEGs, and not surprisingly most softwares use different models and assumptions to analyze mRNAseq data. Here, we propose a mechanistic justification to model mRNAseq as a binomial process, with data from technical replicates given by a binomial distribution, and data from biological replicates well-described by a beta-binomial distribution. We demonstrate good agreement of this model with two large datasets. We show that an emergent feature of the beta-binomial distribution, given parameter regimes typical for mRNAseq experiments, is the well-known quadratic polynomial scaling of variance with the mean. The so-called dispersion parameter controls this scaling, and our analysis suggests that the dispersion parameter is a continually decreasing function of the mean, as opposed to current approaches that impose an asymptotic value to the dispersion parameter at moderate mean read counts. We show how this leads to current approaches overestimating variance for moderately to highly expressed genes, which inflates false negative rates. Describing mRNAseq data with a beta-binomial distribution thus may be preferred since its parameters are relatable to the mechanistic underpinnings of the technique and may improve the consistency of DEG analysis across softwares, particularly for moderately to highly expressed genes."

Plk could recognize substrates through interaction between its phosphopeptide interaction domain, the polo-box domain, and a phosphorylated priming site in the substrate, which has been generated by a priming kinase beforehand. However, the physiological relevance of this targeting mechanism remains to be addressed for many of the Plk1 substrates. Here, we show that budding yeast Plk1, Cdc5, is pre-deposited onto cohesin engaged in cohesion on chromosome arms in G2/M phase cells.

This study aimed to investigate the use of normal myometrium as an internal reference for endometrial and cervical cancer during multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MCE-MRI) and to explore whether this information regarding tumor enhancement relative to the myometrium could be used to discriminate between endometrial and cervical cancer.MRI images, before and after contrast enhancement, were analyzed in newly diagnosed cervical (n = 18) and endometrial cancer (n = 19) patients. Signal intensities (SIs) from tumor tissue and non-neoplastic myometrium were measured using imaging software.The relative signal for cervical cancer was approximately 30% higher than that of endometrial cancer after contrast administration. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for SI, relative signal enhancement, and tumor to myometrium contrast ratio (as used to discriminate between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer) was 0.7807, 0.7456 and 0.7895, respectively. There was no difference in SI of the normal myometrium between endometrial and cervical cancer patients prior to and after contrast administration. Using non-tumorous myometrium as an internal reference, the tumor to myometrium contrast ratio was significantly higher in tumor tissue from cervical cancer compared with that from endometrial cancer at 25 s post contrast enhancement (p = 0.0016), with an optimal sensitivity of 72.22% and specificity of 84.21%.With SI normalized to baseline or normal myometrium, tumor tissue from cervical cancer patients showed significant hyperintensity compared with that of tumor tissue from endometrial cancer patients after contrast enhancement, yielding acceptable performance. The use of the myometrium as an internal reference may provide an alternative method to analyze MCE-MRI data."

Methods One-hundred-thirty patients with pSS who underwent immunoserological tests, minor salivary gland biopsies, and optical coherence tomography examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Risk factors for abnormally reduced peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (mGCIPL) thicknesses were evaluated, as well as the correlation between clinical factors and pRNFL and mGCIPL thicknesses. Results Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SSB) antibody positivity (P = 0.048) was identified as a risk factor associated with abnormally reduced pRNFL thickness, and anti-SSB positivity (P = 0.005) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) level (P = 0.031) were identified as risk factors associated with an abnormally reduced mGCIPL thickness as revealed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. There was a significant negative correlation between anti-SSB antibody levels and the thickness of pRNFL and mGCIPL. The thicknesses of pRNFL and mGCIPL were significantly reduced in anti-SSB–positive eyes when compared to anti-SSB–negative eyes (P < 0.05). However, histopathologic grading was not associated with the pRNFL and mGCIPL thicknesses. Conclusion Anti-SSB antibody positivity and ESR levels may be useful for predicting an abnormally reduced pRNFL or mGCIPL thickness in patients with pSS. Our results may provide clinical evidence to substantiate the association between aberrant autoimmunity and inner retinal changes in patients with pSS."

DERA´s potential is particularly highlighted by the ability to catalyze sequential, highly enantioselective aldol reactions. However, its synthetic use is limited by the absence of an enantiocomplementary enzyme. Here, we introduce the concept of homologous grafting to identify stereoselectivity-determining amino acid positions in DERA. We identified such positions by structural analysis of the homologous aldolases 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase (KDPG) and the enantiocomplementary enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate aldolase (KDPGal). Mutation of these positions led to a slightly inversed enantiopreference of both aldolases to the same extent. By transferring these sequence motifs onto DERA we achieved the intended change in enantioselectivity."

To define the mechanisms how the lncRNAs regulate LR, we performed bio-chip technology, high-throughput sequencing and RT-PCR to detect the expression of lncRNAs at 0, 2 and 6 h during LR after 2/3 hepatectomy (PH). The results indicated that 28 lncRNAs were involved in LR. Bioinformatics analysis predicated 465 co-expression target genes including 10 regulatory genes were related to these 28 lncRNAs. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was employed to analyze the signaling pathways and physiological activities that regulated by these genes, and the results suggested that these genes were potentially related to ILK, SAPK/JNK and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, and possibly regulate many important physiological activities in LR in terms of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis and necrosis."

In this work, the thickness and radial dependence of cartilage properties are incorporated into a 3D mechano-electrochemical model to explore the relevance of heterogeneity in the behaviour of the tissue. The model considers four essential phenomena: (i) osmotic pressure, (ii) convective and diffusive processes, (iii) chemical expansion and (iv) three-dimensional through-the-thickness heterogeneity of the tissue. The need to consider heterogeneity in computational simulations of cartilage behaviour and in manufacturing biomaterials mimicking this tissue is discussed. To this end, healthy tibial plateaus from pigs were mechanically and biochemically tested in-vitro. Heterogeneous properties were included in the mechano-electrochemical computational model to simulate tissue swelling. The simulation results demonstrated that swelling of the heterogeneous samples was significantly lower than swelling under homogeneous and isotropic conditions. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the flux of water and ions in the former samples. In conclusion, the computational model presented here can be considered as a valuable tool for predicting how the variation of cartilage properties affects its behaviour, opening up possibilities for exploring the requirements of cartilage-mimicking biomaterials for tissue engineering. Besides, the model also allows the establishment of behavioural patterns of swelling and of water and ion fluxes in articular cartilage."

In this way we have followed abundance trends of five wolf packs whose home ranges are intersected by a motorway which spans throughout the wolf distribution range in Croatia. During the five-year monitoring of six green bridges we have recorded 28 250 camera-events, 132 with wolves. Four viaducts were monitored for two years, recording 4914 camera-events, 185 with wolves. We have detected a negative abundance trend of the monitored Croatian wolf packs since 2011, especially severe in the northern part of the study area. Further, we have pinpointed the legal cull as probable major negative influence on the wolf pack abundance trends (linear regression, r2 > 0.75, P < 0.05). Using the same approach we did not find evidence for a negative impact of wolves on the prey populations, both wild ungulates and livestock. We encourage strict protection of wolf in Croatia until there is more data proving population stability. In conclusion, quantitative methods, such as the one presented here, should be used as much as possible when assessing wolf abundance trends."
https://openalex.org/W848995424,"Stability is a desirable property of complex ecosystems. If a community of interacting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to withstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without suffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an equilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the population dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and long-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the community matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to describe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established result that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region of `transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to species' abundances---to the population vector---is amplified before ultimately decaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability can be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the community matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude of perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community matrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey interactions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose dynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Our results will lead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex system may irrecoverably break stability."
https://openalex.org/W2468665492,"Usp29 (Ubiquitin-specific protease 29) is a paternally expressed gene located upstream of another imprinted gene Peg3. In the current study, the transcription of this long coding gene spanning a 250-kb genomic distance was truncated using a knockin allele. According to the results, paternal transmission of the mutant allele resulted in reduced body and litter sizes whereas the maternal transmission caused no obvious effects. In the paternal mutant, the expression levels of Usp29 were reduced to 14–18% level of the wild-type littermates due to the Poly-A signal included in the knockin cassette. Expression analyses further revealed an unusual female-specific up-regulation of the adjacent imprinted gene Zfp264 in the mutant. Consistent with this, the promoter of Zfp264 was hypomethylated only in the female mutant. Interestingly, this female-specific hypomethylation by the knockin allele was not detected in the offspring of an interspecific crossing, indicating its sensitivity to genetic background. Overall, the results suggest that the transcription of Usp29 may be involved in DNA methylation setting of Zfp264 promoter in a sex-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2471253766,"The conservation of aquatic plants in river ecosystems should consider the wash-out (away) problem resulting from severe rainfall. The aquatic plant Schoenoplectus gemmifer is an endangered species endemic to Japan. Our previous study reported that the population size of S. gemmifer in Hamamatsu city, Japan, had decreased by one-tenth because many individuals had been washed out by a series of heavy rains in 2004. However, there is insufficient information on the ecological nature of this endangered aquatic plant for adequate conservation. In this paper, we report the population dynamics of one population in Hamamatsu city from 2004 to 2012 in relation to rainfall. We surveyed the number and growing location of all living individuals in the population 300 times during the study period. To examine the temporal changes of individual plants, we also counted the number of culms for 38 individuals in four observations among 300 records. Decreases and increases in the population size of this plant were associated with washing out and the settlement of gemmae (vegetative propagation), respectively. The major cause of the reduction in the population size was an increase in the number of washed-out individuals and not the decreased settlement of gemmae. The wash-out rates for small and large individuals were not significantly different. Small individuals having a stream form with linear leaves resisted flooding, and large individuals were often partially torn off by flooding events. Modification of river basins to reduce the flow velocity may be effective for the conservation of S. gemmifer."
https://openalex.org/W2462030450,"Major joining methods of dental casting metal include brazing and laser welding. However, brazing cannot be applied for electroformed metals since heat treatment could affect the fit, and, therefore, laser welding is used for such metals. New methods of joining metals that do not impair the characteristics of electroformed metals should be developed. When new coating is performed on the surface of the base metal, surface treatment is usually performed before re-coating. The effect of surface treatment is clinically evaluated by peeling and flex tests. However, these testing methods are not ideal for deposition coating strength measurement of electroformed metals. There have been no studies on the deposition coating strength and methods to test electroformed metals. We developed a new deposition coating strength test for electroformed metals. The influence of the negative electrolytic method, which is one of the electrochemical surface treatments, on the strength of the deposition coating of electroformed metals was investigated, and the following conclusions were drawn: 1. This process makes it possible to remove residual deposits on the electrodeposited metal surface layer. 2. Cathode electrolysis is a simple and safe method that is capable of improving the surface treatment by adjustments to the current supply method and current intensity. 3. Electrochemical treatment can improve the deposition coating strength compared to the physical or chemical treatment methods. 4. Electro-deposition coating is an innovative technique for the deposition coating of electroformed metal."
