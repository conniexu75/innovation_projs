https://openalex.org/W3093974194,"Several coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently in human trials. In June 2020, we surveyed 13,426 people in 19 countries to determine potential acceptance rates and factors influencing acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of these, 71.5% of participants reported that they would be very or somewhat likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine, and 48.1% reported that they would accept their employer's recommendation to do so. Differences in acceptance rates ranged from almost 90% (in China) to less than 55% (in Russia). Respondents reporting higher levels of trust in information from government sources were more likely to accept a vaccine and take their employer's advice to do so."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the earlier SARS-CoV use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor; however, their tissue tropism differs, raising the possibility that additional host factors are involved. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a cleavage site for the protease furin that is absent from SARS-CoV (see the Perspective by Kielian). Cantuti-Castelvetri et al. now show that neuropilin-1 (NRP1), which is known to bind furin-cleaved substrates, potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with highest expression in endothelial and epithelial cells. Daly et al. found that the furin-cleaved S1 fragment of the spike protein binds directly to cell surface NRP1 and blocking this interaction with a small-molecule inhibitor or monoclonal antibodies reduced viral infection in cell culture. Understanding the role of NRP1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection may suggest potential targets for future antiviral therapeutics. Science , this issue p. 856 , p. 861 ; see also p. 765"

https://openalex.org/W3092296275,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently identified coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we comprehensively define the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human RNAs. NSP16 binds to the mRNA recognition domains of the U1 and U2 splicing RNAs and acts to suppress global mRNA splicing upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. NSP1 binds to 18S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome and leads to global inhibition of mRNA translation upon infection. Finally, NSP8 and NSP9 bind to the 7SL RNA in the signal recognition particle and interfere with protein trafficking to the cell membrane upon infection. Disruption of each of these essential cellular functions acts to suppress the interferon response to viral infection. Our results uncover a multipronged strategy utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize essential cellular processes to suppress host defenses."

A trimeric spike protein that decorates the virus is a primary target of the host immune system and the focus of vaccine development. Bangaru et al. present the structure of a leading vaccine candidate: a full-length spike protein with some modifications aimed at enhancing stability that is formulated in polysorbate 80 detergent. The study confirms that the full-length immunogen is in a stable prefusion conformation and provides a basis for understanding immune responses to the vaccine. Science , this issue p. 1089"
https://openalex.org/W3094032395,"COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared throughout the World and currently affected more than 9 million people and caused the death of around 470,000 patients. The novel strain of the coronavirus disease is transmittable at a devastating rate with a high rate of severe hospitalization even more so for the elderly population. Naso-oro-pharyngeal swab samples as the first step towards detecting suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2 provides a non-invasive method for PCR testing at a high confidence rate. Furthermore, proteomics analysis of PCR positive and negative naso-oropharyngeal samples provides information on the molecular level which highlights disease pathology. Samples from 15 PCR positive cases and 15 PCR negative cases were analyzed with nanoLC-MS/MS to identify the differentially expressed proteins. Proteomic analyses identified 207 proteins across the sample set and 17 of them were statistically significant. Protein-protein interaction analyses emphasized pathways like Neutrophil degranulation, Innate Immune System, Antimicrobial Peptides. Neutrophil Elastase (ELANE), Azurocidin (AZU1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Myeloblastin (PRTN3), Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Transcobalamine-1 (TCN1) were found to be significantly altered in naso-oropharyngeal samples of SARS-CoV-2 patients. The identified proteins are linked to alteration in the innate immune system specifically via neutrophil degranulation and NETosis."
https://openalex.org/W3093382842,"Distributed neural population spiking patterns in macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex that support core object recognition require additional time to develop for specific, “late-solved” images. This suggests the necessity of recurrent processing in these computations. Which brain circuits are responsible for computing and transmitting these putative recurrent signals to IT? To test whether the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a critical recurrent node in this system, here, we pharmacologically inactivated parts of vlPFC and simultaneously measured IT activity while monkeys performed object discrimination tasks. vlPFC inactivation deteriorated the quality of late-phase (>150 ms from image onset) IT population code and produced commensurate behavioral deficits for late-solved images. Finally, silencing vlPFC caused the monkeys’ IT activity and behavior to become more like those produced by feedforward-only ventral stream models. Together with prior work, these results implicate fast recurrent processing through vlPFC as critical to producing behaviorally sufficient object representations in IT."
https://openalex.org/W3092961487,"Optogenetics has revolutionized neuroscience in small laboratory animals, but its effect on animal models more closely related to humans, such as non-human primates (NHPs), has been mixed. To make evidence-based decisions in primate optogenetics, the scientific community would benefit from a centralized database listing all attempts, successful and unsuccessful, of using optogenetics in the primate brain. We contacted members of the community to ask for their contributions to an open science initiative. As of this writing, 45 laboratories around the world contributed more than 1,000 injection experiments, including precise details regarding their methods and outcomes. Of those entries, more than half had not been published. The resource is free for everyone to consult and contribute to on the Open Science Framework website. Here we review some of the insights from this initial release of the database and discuss methodological considerations to improve the success of optogenetic experiments in NHPs."
https://openalex.org/W3094211096,"Neutralizing agents against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. Here, we present a strategy to rapidly identify and assemble synthetic human variable heavy (VH) domains toward neutralizing epitopes. We constructed a VH-phage library and targeted the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding interface of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (Spike-RBD). Using a masked selection approach, we identified VH binders to two non-overlapping epitopes and further assembled these into multivalent and bi-paratopic formats. These VH constructs showed increased affinity to Spike (up to 600-fold) and neutralization potency (up to 1,400-fold) on pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus when compared to standalone VH domains. The most potent binder, a trivalent VH, neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.0 nM (180 ng ml-1). A cryo-EM structure of the trivalent VH bound to Spike shows each VH domain engaging an RBD at the ACE2 binding site, confirming our original design strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3093424769,"Imaging large-scale circuit dynamics is crucial to understanding brain function, but most techniques have a limited depth of field. Here, we describe volumetric functional ultrasound imaging (vfUSI), a platform for brain-wide vfUSI of hemodynamic activity in awake head-fixed mice. We combined a high-frequency 1,024-channel 2D-array transducer with advanced multiplexing and high-performance computing for real-time 3D power Doppler imaging at a high spatiotemporal resolution (220 × 280 × 175 μm3, up to 6 Hz). We developed a standardized software pipeline for registration, segmentation, and temporal analysis in 268 individual brain regions based on the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework. We demonstrated the high sensitivity of vfUSI under multiple experimental conditions, and we successfully imaged stimulus-evoked activity when only a few trials were averaged. We also mapped neural circuits in vivo across the whole brain during optogenetic activation of specific cell types. Moreover, we identified the sequential activation of sensory-motor networks during a grasping water-droplet task."

BP proliferation is governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals, several of which have been identified. However, a role of neurotransmitters, a canonical class of extrinsic signaling molecules, in BP proliferation remains to be established. Here, we show that serotonin (5-HT), via its receptor HTR2A, promotes BP proliferation in an evolutionarily relevant manner. HTR2A is not expressed in embryonic mouse Ncx; accordingly, 5-HT does not increase mouse BP proliferation. However, ectopic HTR2A expression can increase mouse BP proliferation. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of endogenous HTR2A in embryonic ferret Ncx reduces BP proliferation. Pharmacological activation of endogenous HTR2A in fetal human Ncx ex vivo increases BP proliferation via HER2/ERK signaling. Hence, 5-HT emerges as an important extrinsic pro-proliferative signal for BPs, which may have contributed to evolutionary Ncx expansion.

The expansion of the Ncx, which in humans is the site of our cognitive abilities, is thought to primarily be due to an increase in neuron production. Neuron production and Ncx size are governed by the abundance and proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during embryonic/fetal development (Dehay et al., 2015Dehay C. Kennedy H.

Two classes of NPCs in the developing Ncx can be distinguished. First is apical progenitors (APs), which include neuroepithelial cells and apical (or ventricular) radial glia (aRG) and which reside in the ventricular zone (VZ), undergoing mitosis at the ventricular surface (Götz and Huttner, 2005Götz M.

Second is basal progenitors (BPs), which originate from APs, leave the VZ, migrate to and reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ), and undergo mitosis at an abventricular location, typically in the SVZ (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W. Attardo A. Denk W. Huttner W.B. Neurons arise in the basal neuroepithelium of the early mammalian telencephalon: a major site of neurogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

APs are highly proliferative in most, if not all, mammalian species, whereas BPs display great variability in proliferative capacity across mammals (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H. Hansen D.V.

This variability appears to be linked to (1) the relative abundance of the two major BP subtypes, basal intermediate progenitors (bIPs) versus basal (or outer) radial glia (bRG) (Florio and Huttner, 2014Florio M.

Specifically, among the cell-extrinsic signals, growth factors such as heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) and fibroblast growth factor have been reported to stimulate NPC proliferation and to regulate the cell fate switch from neurons to astrocytes, respectively (Dinh Duong et al., 2019Dinh Duong T.A.

In contrast, little is known about the potential regulation of BP proliferation by neurotransmitters. Among the neurotransmitters, serotonin (5-HT) emerges as an interesting target of study to be potentially involved in BP proliferation. First, both mouse and human developing Ncx contain 5-HT, which arises from placental sources at the onset of neurogenesis and from embryonic serotonergic afferents at later developmental stages (Bonnin et al., 2011Bonnin A. Goeden N. Chen K. Wilson M.L. King J. Shih J.C. Blakely R.D. Deneris E.S. Levitt P. A transient placental source of serotonin for the fetal forebrain.Nature. 2011; 472: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Second, 5-HT has been implicated in certain aspects of cortical development based on studies using transgenic mouse models with altered 5-HT levels in the embryonic (E-) Ncx and rat or human organotypic slice culture systems (Cheng et al., 2010Cheng A.

However, despite their value, these studies did not show a 5-HT–mediated increase in BP proliferation, nor did they focus on a possible role of 5-HT–stimulated BP proliferation in the evolutionary expansion of the Ncx. Here, we have examined the effects of 5-HT in BP proliferation in developing mouse, ferret, and human Ncx. We find that, in E-ferret and fetal (F-) human Ncx, 5-HT stimulates the proliferation of BPs, and notably of bRG, and demonstrate the key role of the receptor HTR2A in this evolutionarily relevant function of 5-HT. In order to explore a possible role of 5-HT in BP proliferation, we first treated E-mouse (embryonic day [E] 13.5), E-ferret (E37), and F-human (11 weeks post-conception [wpc]) Ncx tissue with 50 μM 5-HT for 48 h in an ex vivo free-floating tissue (FFT) culture system. Analysis by immunofluorescence (Figures 1A–1C, Figure S1A) showed that there was a significant increase in abventricular phospho-histone H3–positive (PH3+) cells, i.e., mitotic BPs, in E-ferret and F-human Ncx treated with 5-HT compared to controls (Figures 1E and 1F; Figure S1B) but no change in mitotic BPs in E-mouse Ncx treated with 5-HT (Figure 1D). This raised the possibility that a difference in the expression of serotonergic system-related genes, notably the 5-HT receptors (HTR), may explain the lack in E-mouse versus presence in F-human Ncx of the 5-HT–increased BP proliferation. We therefore exploited previously published transcriptome datasets (Fietz et al., 2012Fietz S.A. Lachmann R. Brandl H. Kircher M. Samusik N. Schröder R. Lakshmanaperumal N. Henry I. Vogt J. Riehn A. et al.Transcriptomes of germinal zones of human and mouse fetal neocortex suggest a role of extracellular matrix in progenitor self-renewal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In 13–16 wpc human Ncx, the 5-HT receptor 2A (HTR2A) was the only one among the seven main HTR family members that showed a significant level of mRNA expression in all three germinal zones (VZ, ISVZ, and OSVZ; Figures S1C and S1E). Accordingly, in 12–13 wpc human aRG and bRG, the HTR2A mRNA level was the highest when compared to the other HTR family members (Figures S1D and S1F). In contrast, HTR2A mRNA was virtually absent (FPKM < 0.5) in all the Ncx zones and isolated cell populations of E14.5 mouse Ncx analyzed (Figures S1C–S1F). Such an expression pattern, with higher levels in NPCs (germinal zones) and lower levels in neurons (cortical plate) in F-human Ncx and a virtual absence in E-mouse Ncx, was not observed for any other neurotransmitter receptor analyzed (Figure S2). We next examined the distribution of the HTR2A protein in E-mouse, E-ferret, and F-human Ncx by immunofluorescence (Figures 1G–1I). Consistent with the mRNA expression data (Figures S1C–S1F), the HTR2A protein was readily detected in 11 wpc human VZ, ISVZ, and OSVZ, with a pattern indicative of an occurrence in NPCs (Figure 1I). This immunofluorescence signal was specific because it was not observed in the absence of primary, anti-HTR2A, antibody (Figure S3A). The latter antibody selectively recognized the HTR2A protein upon immunoblotting of a total homogenate of F-human Ncx (Figure S3B), further corroborating its specificity. In contrast to the immunofluorescence signal observed in F-human Ncx, no specific immunofluorescence signal could be detected in the E13.5 mouse Ncx (Figure 1G), consistent with previous findings (Mayer et al., 2019Mayer S. Chen J. Velmeshev D. Mayer A. Eze U.C. Bhaduri A. Cunha C.E. Jung D. Arjun A.

This lack of HTR2A immunoreactivity in E-mouse Ncx was not due to the fact that an anti-human HTR2A antibody was used because we did detect HTR2A immunoreactivity in the adult mouse hippocampus (Figure S3C). The HTR2A protein was also detected in the germinal zones of E37 ferret Ncx (Figure 1H). In addition to the germinal zones, HTR2A protein was also observed in the E37 ferret and 11 wpc human cortical plate (CP) (Figures 1H and 1I), where its presence does not necessarily reflect occurrence in neurons but would also be compatible with a localization in NPC basal processes"
https://openalex.org/W3093166905,"Corticostriatal synaptic integration is partitioned among striosome (patch) and matrix compartments of the dorsal striatum, allowing compartmentalized control of discrete aspects of behavior. Despite the significance of such organization, it's unclear how compartment-specific striatal output is dynamically achieved, particularly considering new evidence that overlap of afferents is substantial. We show that dopamine oppositely shapes responses to convergent excitatory inputs in mouse striosome and matrix striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Activation of postsynaptic D1 dopamine receptors promoted the generation of long-lasting synaptically evoked ""up-states"" in matrix SPNs but opposed it in striosomes, which were more excitable under basal conditions. Differences in dopaminergic modulation were mediated, in part, by dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs): pharmacological manipulation of L-type VGCCs reversed compartment-specific responses to D1 receptor activation. These results support a novel mechanism for the selection of striatal circuit components, where fluctuating levels of dopamine shift the balance of compartment-specific striatal output."
https://openalex.org/W3094632803,"The initial phase dynamics of an epidemic without containment measures is commonly well modelled using exponential growth models. However, in the presence of containment measures, the exponential model becomes less appropriate. Under the implementation of an isolation measure for detected infectives, we propose to model epidemic dynamics by fitting a flexible growth model curve to reported positive cases, and to infer the overall epidemic dynamics by introducing information on the detection/testing effort and recovery and death rates. The resulting modelling approach is close to the Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, active cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Fits on limited data before the observed peaks illustrate the ability of the flexible growth model to approach the estimates from the whole data."

We aimed to compare various Machine learning algorithms with a Meta learner approach to find the best of these as a predictor of NAFLD. Methods The study included 2970 subjects, 2920 constituting the training set and 50, randomly selected, used in the test phase, performing cross-validation. The best predictors were combined to create three models: 1) FLI plus GLUCOSE plus SEX plus AGE, 2) AVI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE, 3) BRI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE. Eight machine learning algorithms were trained with the predictors of each of the three models created. For these algorithms, the percent accuracy, variance and percent weight were compared. Results The SVM algorithm performed better with all models. Model 1 had 68% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 27.35; Model 2 had 68% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 33.62 and Model 3 had 77% accuracy, with 1% variance and an algorithm weight of 34.70. Model 2 was the most performing, composed of AVI plus GLUCOSE plus GGT plus SEX plus AGE, despite a lower percentage of accuracy. Conclusion A Machine Learning approach can support NAFLD diagnosis and reduce health costs. The SVM algorithm is easy to apply and the necessary parameters are easily retrieved in databases."
https://openalex.org/W3093721121,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndrome, characterized by tumor development in multiple organs, including renal angiomyolipoma. Biallelic loss of TSC1 or TSC2 is a known genetic driver of angiomyolipoma development, however, whether an altered transcriptional repertoire contributes to TSC-associated tumorigenesis is unknown. RNA-seq analyses showed that MITF A isoform (MITF-A) was consistently highly expressed in angiomyolipoma, immunohistochemistry showed microphthalmia-associated transcription factor nuclear localization, and Chromatin immuno-Precipitation Sequencing analysis showed that the MITF-A transcriptional start site was highly enriched with H3K27ac marks. Using the angiomyolipoma cell line 621-101, MITF knockout (MITF.KO) and MITF-A overexpressing (MITF.OE) cell lines were generated. MITF.KO cells showed markedly reduced growth and invasion in vitro, and were unable to form xenografted tumors. In contrast, MITF.OE cells grew faster in vitro and as xenografted tumors compared to control cells. RNA-Seq analysis showed that both ID2 and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) expression levels were increased in the MITF.OE cells and reduced in the MITF.KO cells, and luciferase assays showed this was due to transcriptional effects. Importantly, CYR61 overexpression rescued MITF.KO cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that MITF-A is a transcriptional oncogenic driver of angiomyolipoma tumor development, acting through regulation of CYR61."

https://openalex.org/W3094247769,"Background Post-term pregnancies have increased risks for adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. Maternal concentrations of the placenta-associated proteins placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) have been identified as predictors for preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction, both syndromes of placental dysfunction. We have proposed that low maternal circulating PlGF and increased sFlt-1 are general markers for syncytiotrophoblast stress, which increases at and beyond term, even in apparently uncomplicated pregnancies. Our aim was to establish circulating PlGF, sFlt-1, and sFlt-1/PlGF reference ranges in healthy post-term pregnancies (gestational week ≥40+2), comparing with healthy term pregnancies and evaluating associations between time to delivery and biomarker percentiles. Methods Of 501 healthy, singleton post-term pregnancies prospectively recruited between September 2016 and December 2017 at our tertiary obstetric department, 426 with an uncomplicated delivery outcome contributed PlGF and sFlt-1 serum concentrations for reference range construction. A retrospective, cross-sectional, term group with an uncomplicated delivery outcome (n = 146) served as comparison. Differences in percentile values between groups and confidence intervals were calculated by quantile regression. Results In post-term pregnancies the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles for PlGF were: 70, 172, and 496 pg/mL; for sFlt-1: 2074, 4268, and 9141 pg/mL; and for sFlt-1/PlGF 5.3, 25.5, and 85.2. Quantile regression analyses comparing the post-term to the term group showed for PlGF a trend towards higher 10th through 30th percentiles, for sFlt-1 significantly higher 10th through 80th percentiles, and for sFlt-1/PlGF ratio significantly higher 30th percentile and significantly lower 95th percentile. PlGF below the 5th percentile and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio above the 95th percentile was associated with shorter time to delivery (p = 0.031 and p = 0.025, respectively). Conclusions Our findings support the concept of increasing syncytiotrophoblast stress post-term in clinically healthy pregnancies. Whether post-term dysregulated angiogenic markers reflect a biological placental clock merits further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3093587930,"The robustness of networks against node failure and the response of networks to node removal has been studied extensively for networks such as transportation networks, power grids, and food webs. In many cases, a network’s clustering coefficient was identified as a good indicator for network robustness. In ecology, habitat networks constitute a powerful tool to represent metapopulations or -communities, where nodes represent habitat patches and links indicate how these are connected. Current climate and land-use changes result in decline of habitat area and its connectivity and are thus the main drivers for the ongoing biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts are therefore needed to improve the connectivity and mitigate effects of habitat loss. Habitat loss can easily be modelled with the help of habitat networks and the question arises how to modify networks to obtain higher robustness. Here, we develop tools to identify which links should be added to a network to increase the robustness. We introduce two different heuristics, Greedy and Lazy Greedy, to maximize the clustering coefficient if multiple links can be added. We test these approaches and compare the results to the optimal solution for different generic networks including a variety of standard networks as well as spatially explicit landscape based habitat networks. In a last step, we simulate the robustness of habitat networks before and after adding multiple links and investigate the increase in robustness depending on both the number of added links and the heuristic used. We found that using our heuristics to add links to sparse networks such as habitat networks has a greater impact on the clustering coefficient compared to randomly adding links. The Greedy algorithm delivered optimal results in almost all cases when adding two links to the network. Furthermore, the robustness of networks increased with the number of additional links added using the Greedy or Lazy Greedy algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W3094519101,"Objective An increasing number of diseases is linked to deterioration of quality of life (QoL). Part of this association can be explained by socio-economic factors, which are most commonly accounted for. Our aim was to explore the potential contribution of other factors related to clinical burden, social interaction and functioning. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on wave 6 of the population-based Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), among participants aged 50+ (n = 67 179). The Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization and Pleasure (CASP-12v1) questionnaire measured QoL. The association between number of diseases and QoL was tested in a mixed-effects linear regression model. The base model controlled for socio-economic characteristics. Factors of interest (symptoms, polypharmacy, unmet care needs, utilisation of care, social network, personal and financial help, loneliness and activities of daily living (ADL) with instrumental activities (IADL)) were added to the base model one at a time and tested for relevance (i.e. change in the β-coefficient of the number of conditions of 15% or more). Results Symptoms, polypharmacy, loneliness and ADL/IADL appeared relevant and were retained in the final model. The association between number of conditions and QoL in the base model was -2.44 [95% CI: -2.72; -2.16], while this association was -0.76 [95%CI: -0.97; -0.54] after all relevant factors were included. Conclusion Factors beyond the socio-economic circumstances play an important role in explaining the association between number of conditions and QoL. These factors should be considered to better estimate the impact of chronic diseases on QoL, and for improving patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3093876299,"Introduction Antimicrobial use is associated with emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We report hospital antimicrobial procurement, as a surrogate for consumption in humans, expenditure and prices in public hospitals in Vietnam, a lower middle-income country with a high burden of drug resistant infections. Method Data on antimicrobial procurement were obtained from tender-winning bids from provincial health authorities and public hospitals with detailed bids representing 28.7% (1.68 / 5.85 billion US $) of total hospital medication spend in Vietnam. Antimicrobials were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Index and the 2019 WHO Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) groups. Volume was measured in number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Antimicrobial prices were presented per DDD. Results Expenditure on systemic antibacterials and antifungals accounted for 28.6% (US $482.6 million/US $1.68 billion) of the total drug bids. 83% of antibacterials (572,698,014 DDDs) by volume (accounting for 45.5% of the antibacterials spend) were domestically supplied. Overall, the most procured antibacterials by DDD were second generation cephalosporins, combinations of penicillins and beta-lactamase inhibitors, and penicillins with extended spectrum. For parenteral antibacterials this was third generation cephalosporins. The average price for antibacterials was US $15.6, US $0.86, US $0.4 and US $11.7 per DDD for Reserve, Watch, Access and non-recommended/unclassified group antibacterials, respectively. Conclusions Antimicrobials accounted for a substantial proportion of the funds spent for medication in public hospitals in Vietnam. The pattern of antibacterial consumption was similar to other countries. The high prices of Reserve group and non-recommended/unclassified antibacterials suggests a need for a combination of national pricing and antimicrobial stewardship policies to ensure appropriate accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W3093961821,"Coral bleaching driven by ocean warming is one of the most visible ecological impacts of climate change and perhaps the greatest threat to the persistence of reefs in the coming decades. In the absence of returning atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to those compatible with ocean temperatures below the mass coral bleaching temperature thresholds, the most straightforward means to reduce thermal-stress induced bleaching is to cool water at the seabed. The feasibility of reducing the seabed temperature through cool-water injections is considered first by analysing the feasibility of doing so on 19 reefs with differing physical environments using a simple residence time metric in 200 m resolution hydrodynamic model configurations. We then concentrate on the reefs around Lizard Island, the most promising candidate of the 19 locations, and develop a 40 m hydrodynamic model to investigate the effect of the injection of cool water at differing volumetric rates. Injecting 27°C seawater at a rate of 5 m3 s−1 at 4 sites in early 2017 cooled 97 ha of the reef by 0.15°C or more. The power required to pump 5 m3 s−1 through a set of pipes over a distance of 3 km from a nearby channel is ∼466 kW. This power applied at 4 sites for 3 months achieves a 2 Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs) reduction on 97 ha of reef. A more precise energy costing will require further expert engineering design of the pumping equipment and energy sources. Even for the most physically favourable reefs, cool-water transported through pipes and injected at a reef site is energy expensive and cannot be scaled up to any meaningful fraction of the 3,100 reefs of the GBR. Should priority be given to reducing thermal stress on one or a few high value reefs, this paper provides a framework to identify the most promising sites."
https://openalex.org/W3094133068,"Background Though long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are highly effective, have minimal side effects, require minimal follow-up, and are low cost, only 10% of contraceptives used in Ethiopia are LARCs. The reason for this low uptake is not understood at the country or regional level. Therefore, this study identified determinants of LARC utilization in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based unmatched case control study, using LARC users as cases and short- acting reversible contraception (SARC) users as controls, had been conducted at fourteen public health institutions in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select participants with a 1:2 case to control ratio (n = 1167). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of LARC utilization among family planning service users. Results Wealth status [AOR:1.87, 95%CI (1.08, 3.24)], history of abortion [AOR:2.69, 95%CI (1.41, 5.12)], limiting family size [AOR: 2.38, 95%CI (1.01, 5.62)], good knowledge about LARCs [AOR: 2.52, 95%CI (1.17, 5.41)], method convenience [AOR: 0.23, 95%CI (0.16, 0.34)], good availability of method [AOR:0.10 (0.05, 0.19)], less frequent visits to health facility [AOR:2.95, 95% CI(1.89, 4.62)], health care providers advice [AOR:10.69, 95%CI (3.27, 34.87)], partner approval [AOR:0.66, 95%CI (0.45, 0.97)], and favorable attitude towards LARCs [AOR:13.0, 95%CI (8.60, 19.72)] were significantly associated with LARC utilization. Conclusion Professional support, favorable attitude towards LARC use, high economic status, history of abortion, advantage of less frequent visits, having good knowledge towards LARC and interest of limiting births were significantly associated with LARC Utilization. On the other hand, perceived method convenience, and contraception availability were inversely associated with it. Family planning education about the benefits of LARC should be done by health providers and media. Male involvement in the counselling and decision making about the advantage of using LARC may improve the negative influence of partners on LARC utilization. It is also recommended that, future qualitative research further explore perceptions of LARC use."
https://openalex.org/W3088413218,"Does the experience of childbirth create social bonds among first-time mothers? Previous research suggests that sharing emotionally intense or painful experiences with others leads to “identity fusion,” a visceral feeling of oneness with a group that predicts strong forms of prosocial action and self-sacrifice for other group members. This study compared identity fusion with other mothers during pregnancy versus after childbirth in a sample of 164 U.S. women. Eighty-nine mothers in our sample were pregnant with their firstborn, and 75 mothers had given birth to their firstborn up to 6 months prior to the time of data collection. Results demonstrated that identity fusion with other mothers was higher for postpartum mothers than for antenatal mothers. As predicted, among postpartum mothers, those who thought that their childbirth was more painful than a typical childbirth experience reported greater identity fusion with mothers who reported having had a very difficult birth. Postpartum mothers’ ruminative thought about the birth mediated the association between level of dysphoria and identity fusion, and identity fusion moderated the association between postpartum mothers’ ruminative and reflective thought about the birth and their posttraumatic growth in complex ways. These findings provide evidence that perceived sharedness of the childbirth experience and thoughts about the birth are important to the process of identity fusion with other mothers, and highlight the importance of post-event processing for psychological health."
https://openalex.org/W3094046789,"Introduction With increasing rates of opioid overdoses in the US, a surveillance tool to identify high-risk patients may help facilitate early intervention. Objective To develop an algorithm to predict overdose using routinely-collected healthcare databases. Methods Within a US commercial claims database (2011–2015), patients with ≥1 opioid prescription were identified. Patients were randomly allocated into the training (50%), validation (25%), or test set (25%). For each month of follow-up, pooled logistic regression was used to predict the odds of incident overdose in the next month based on patient history from the preceding 3–6 months (time-updated), using elastic net for variable selection. As secondary analyses, we explored whether using simpler models (few predictors, baseline only) or different analytic methods (random forest, traditional regression) influenced performance. Results We identified 5,293,880 individuals prescribed opioids; 2,682 patients (0.05%) had an overdose during follow-up (mean: 17.1 months). On average, patients who overdosed were younger and had more diagnoses and prescriptions. The elastic net model achieved good performance (c-statistic 0.887, 95% CI 0.872–0.902; sensitivity 80.2, specificity 80.1, PPV 0.21, NPV 99.9 at optimal cutpoint). It outperformed simpler models based on few predictors (c-statistic 0.825, 95% CI 0.808–0.843) and baseline predictors only (c-statistic 0.806, 95% CI 0.787–0.26). Different analytic techniques did not substantially influence performance. In the final algorithm based on elastic net, the strongest predictors were age 18–25 years (OR: 2.21), prior suicide attempt (OR: 3.68), opioid dependence (OR: 3.14). Conclusions We demonstrate that sophisticated algorithms using healthcare databases can be predictive of overdose, creating opportunities for active monitoring and early intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3093858164,"Background Poor diets contribute to metabolic complications of obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Metabolomic biomarkers may serve as early nutrition-sensitive health indicators. This family-based lifestyle change program compared metabolic outcomes in an intervention group (INT) that consumed 2 nutrient bars daily for 2-months and a control group (CONT). Methods Overweight, predominantly minority and female adolescent (Teen)/parent adult caretaker (PAC) family units were recruited from a pediatric obesity clinic. CONT (8 Teen, 8 PAC) and INT (10 Teen, 10 PAC) groups randomized to nutrient bar supplementation attended weekly classes that included group nutrition counseling and supervised exercise. Pre-post physical and behavioral parameters, fasting traditional biomarkers, plasma sphingolipids and amino acid metabolites were measured. Results In the full cohort, a baseline sphingolipid ceramide principal component composite score correlated with adiponectin, triglycerides, triglyceride-rich very low density lipoproteins, and atherogenic small low density lipoprotein (LDL) sublasses. Inverse associations were seen between a sphingomyelin composite score and C-reactive protein, a dihydroceramide composite score and diastolic blood pressure, and the final principal component that included glutathionone with fasting insulin and the homeostatic model of insulin resistance. In CONT, plasma ceramides, sphinganine, sphingosine and amino acid metabolites increased, presumably due to increased physical activity. Nutrient bar supplementation (INT) blunted this rise and significantly decreased ureagenic, aromatic and gluconeogenic amino acid metabolites. Metabolomic changes were positively correlated with improvements in clinical biomarkers of dyslipidemia. Conclusion Nutrient bar supplementation with increased physical activity in obese Teens and PAC elicits favorable metabolomic changes that correlate with improved dyslipidemia. The trial from which the analyses reported upon herein was part of a series of nutrient bar clinical trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02239198."
https://openalex.org/W3093893709,"To identify the genomic regions for yield and NUE of rice genotypes and lines with promising yield under low N, a recombinant inbred population (RIL) developed between BPT5204 (a mega variety known for its quality) and PTB1 (variety with high NUE) was evaluated for consecutive wet and dry seasons under low nitrogen (LN) and recommended nitrogen (RN) field conditions. A set of 291 RILs were characterized for 24 traits related to leaf, agro-morphological, yield, N content and nitrogen use efficiency indices. More than 50 RILs were found promising with grain yield >10 g under LN. Parental polymorphism survey with 297 SSRs and selective genotyping revealed five genomic regions associated with yield under LN, which were further saturated with polymorphic SSRs. Thirteen promising SSRs were identified out of 144 marker trait associations under LN using single marker analysis. Composite interval mapping showed 37 QTL under LN with five pleiotropic QTL. A major stable pleiotropic (RM13201-RM13209) from PTB1 spanning 825.4 kb region associated with straw N % (SNP) in both treatments across seasons and yield and yield related traits in WS appears to be promising for the MAS. Another major QTL (RM13181-RM13201) was found to be associated with only relative trait parameters of biomass, grain and grain nitrogen. These two major pleiotropic QTL (RM13201-RM13209 and RM13181-RM13201) on chromosome 2 were characterized for their positive allele effect and could be deployed for the development of rice varieties with NUE."
https://openalex.org/W3093550060,"Aim To assess the effect of the bisphosphonate etidronate on choroidal neovascular (CNV) activity in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Methods This is an ancillary study in a single center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) in which 74 patients with PXE were assigned to either one-year etidronate or placebo treatment. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging and color fundus photography were performed every three months for one year and were systematically assessed on signs of CNV activity. Results In the etidronate group, 11 (30%) of the patients had CNV activity at baseline, compared to 25 (67%) of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.005). The proportion of eyes with CNV activity during the study ranged from 18–33% in the etidronate group and 42–56% in the placebo group and no significant difference in improvement or worsening of CNV activity was found (P = 0.168). Using a generalized mixed model for repeated measures, there was a protective effect of etidronate in crude analysis (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.98) that disappeared when adjusting for baseline CNV activity (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84–1.13). Conclusion In this post-hoc RCT analysis we did not observe a protecting or deteriorating effect of etidronate on CNV activity in patients with PXE after adjustment for baseline CNV."
https://openalex.org/W3093675882,"Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) is a sexually transmitted bacterium in which macrolide resistance is rapidly increasing, limiting treatment options. We validated a new assay to detect the presence of macrolide resistance-associated mutations in MG (MG-MRAM). In 2018, symptomatic and asymptomatic clients visiting sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics in Amsterdam or The Hague were tested for MG using transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assays. The sensitivity to detect MG of the newly developed MG-MRAM qPCR was compared to the MgPa qPCR, both in relation to the TMA assay. For the sensitivity and specificity to detect relevant mutations the MG-MRAM qPCR was compared to 23SrRNA sequencing analysis. The qPCR was subsequently used to determine the presence of MG-MRAM at different anatomical locations and to identify risk factors for MG-MRAM. MG-positive clients (402) providing 493 MG-positive samples were included. In total 309/493 (62.7%) samples from 291 (72.4%) clients were successfully typed with the MG-MRAM qPCR. The MG-MRAM qPCR had a sensitivity of 98.6% (95%CI 91.1%-99.9%) and specificity of 94.1% (95%CI 78.9%-99.0%) to detect MG-MRAM compared to sequencing analysis. Infection with MG-MRAM was detected in 193/291 (66.3%) clients: in 129/178 (72.5%) men and 64/113 (56.6%) women (p = 0.005). Prevalence of MG-MRAM was significantly higher in men, clients with a higher education, HIV-positive clients and clients with >10 sexual partners in the previous six months, but in multivariable analysis no factor was significantly associated with MG-MRAM presence. Since MG-MRAM prevalence was very high, testing for MG-MRAM is essential if treatment for MG is considered, and can be performed with this sensitive and specific qPCR test in routine diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3093710922,"Rice foot rot caused by Dickeya zeae is an important bacterial disease of rice worldwide. In this study, we identified a new strain EC2 from rice in Guangdong province, China. This strain differed from the previously identified strain from rice in its biochemical characteristics, pathogenicity, and genomic constituents. To explore genomic discrepancies between EC2 and previously identified strains from rice, a complete genome sequence of EC2 was obtained and used for comparative genomic analyses. The complete genome sequence of EC2 is 4,575,125 bp in length. EC2 was phylogenetically closest to previously identified Dickeya strains from rice, but not within their subgroup. In terms of secretion systems, genomic comparisons revealed that EC2 harbored only type I (T1SS), typeⅡ (T2SS), and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems. The flagella cluster of this strain possessed specific genomic characteristics like other D. zeae strains from Guangdong and from rice; within this locus, the genetic diversity among strains from rice was much lower than that of within strains from non-rice hosts. Unlike other strains from rice, EC2 lost the zeamine cluster, but retained the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-1 (CRISPR-1) array. Compared to the other D. zeae strains containing both exopolysaccharide (EPS) and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) clusters, EC2 harbored only the CPS cluster, while the other strains from rice carried only the EPS cluster. Furthermore, we found strain MS1 from banana, carrying both EPS and CPS clusters, produced significantly more EPS than the strains from rice, and exhibited different biofilm-associated phenotypes. Comparative genomics analyses suggest EC2 likely evolved through a pathway different from the other D. zeae strains from rice, producing a new type of rice foot rot pathogen. These findings emphasize the emergence of a new type of D. zeae strain causing rice foot rot, an essential step in the early prevention of this rice bacterial disease."
https://openalex.org/W3093736927,"To describe the extent to which local guidelines for admission to UK midwifery units align with national guidance; to describe variation in individual admission criteria; and to describe the extent to which alongside midwifery units (AMUs) are the default option for eligible women.National cross-sectional survey.All 122 UK maternity services with midwifery units, between October 2018 and February 2019.Alignment of local admission guidelines with national guidance (NICE CG190); frequency and nature of variation in individual admission criteria; percentage of services with AMU as default birth setting for eligible women.Admission guidelines were received from 87 maternity services (71%), representing 153 units, and we analysed 85 individual guideline documents. Overall, 92% of local admission guidelines varied from national guidance; 76% contained both some admission criteria that were 'more inclusive' and some that were 'more restrictive' than national guidance. The most common 'more inclusive' admission criteria, occurring in 40-80% of guidelines, were: explicit admission of women with parity ≥4; aged 35-40yrs; with a BMI 30-35kg/m2; selective admission of women with a BMI 35-40kg/m2; Group B Streptococcus carriers; and those undergoing induction of labour. The most common 'more restrictive' admission criteria, occurring in around 30% of guidelines, excluded women who: declined blood products; had experienced female genital cutting; were aged <16yrs; or had not attended for regular antenatal care. Over half of services (59%) reported the AMU as the default option for healthy women with straightforward pregnancies.The variation in local midwifery unit admission criteria found in this study represents a potentially confusing and inequitable basis for women making choices about planned place of birth. A review of national guidance may be indicated and where a lack of relevant evidence underlies variation in admission criteria, further research by planned place of birth is required."
https://openalex.org/W3093820105,"The optimal timing of frozen-thawed blastocyst transfer following hysteroscopic polypectomy is an important and unanswered clinical question. In this study, we conducted a retrospective survey of cases from an infertility center at an academic hospital. We reviewed the charts of all patients who received in-vitro fertilization and frozen-thawed blastocyst transfers (FBT) at the center from January 2009 to November 2019. One hundred and two patients with prior diagnosis of endometrial polyp that were treated with hysteroscopic polypectomy before received their first FBT at the center were identified as cases. Patients without prior diagnosis of endometrial polyp, and who received their first FBT at the center were defined as controls. Controls were enrolled at a 1-to-1 ratio to the cases. The cases and controls did not show differences in baseline characteristics, endometrial thickness, or the number of good blastocysts transferred. The clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates were similar. Regarding the optimal interval between polypectomy and FBT, a cut-off of 120 days was identified from the ROC curve. A stratified analysis showed that when FBT was performed within an interval of 120 days after polypectomy, there were higher biochemical pregnancy rates (73.2%, 45.2%; OR 3.3; P = .007) and clinical pregnancy rates (64.8%, 41.9%; OR 2.54; P = .032), when compared with intervals greater than 120 days. There were no significant differences in implantation and live birth rates. In conclusion, pregnancy rates following FBT in patients who had received prior endometrial polypectomy were comparable to pregnancy rates after FBT in patients without endometrial polyp. Subgroup analysis showed that an interval greater than 120 days between hysteroscopic polypectomy and FBT was associated with decreased pregnancy rates. Patients who wish to receive embryo transfer after polypectomy should wait no longer than 120 days."
https://openalex.org/W3094378371,"Background Since 2010, the Zwolle Healthy City approach, an integrated community-based approach, has been implemented in the Dutch municipality of Zwolle. This approach is proven successful in reducing health inequalities. However, the key elements of this approach are not clear. The current study aimed to identify key elements of this successful local community-based approach, according to the perspectives of various stakeholders. Methods Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 29 professionals who were involved in the approach in the period 2010–2018 and have occupations at the strategic (n = 4), tactical (n = 17) and operational level (n = 8). Data was analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. Results We identified nine perceived key elements that contributed to the success of the approach aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities. The respondents indicated the following key elements: (1) collaboration between a variety of local organizations that want to have impact on the health of citizens; (2) support for the approach on the strategic, tactical and operational level of involved organizations; (3) proper communication and coordination, both for the network and within the organizations; (4) embeddedness in organizations’ policies and processes and (5) collaboration with private organizations is of added value, although there is no “one size fits all”. Other key elements are (6) collaboration with citizens, (7) profiling the approach like a brand and (8) moving along with and taking advantage of opportunities. Finally, (9) continuous monitoring and evaluating goals and processes, and learning from the results, is important. Conclusion Nine key elements were identified that, according to various stakeholders, contributed to the success of the Zwolle Healthy City approach. These insights are important to further strengthen the Zwolle Healthy City approach but may also help and inspire other local integrated community-based approaches aimed at reducing socioeconomic health inequalities, to improve and adapt the approach within their specific local and dynamic context."
https://openalex.org/W3093522693,"An important determinant of alcohol and tobacco use is the adolescent's social network, which has not been explored among out of school youth (OSY). OSY are adolescents not currently enrolled in school and have not completed their schooling. This study aims to qualitatively understand how OSY’s social networks support or constrain alcohol and tobacco use. Respondent-driven sampling was used to select 41 OSY (aged 13–20 years) for individual in-depth interviews in a South African urban area. The data were analysed using content analysis. Smoking and drinking friends, family close in age to OSY that drank and smoked, and lack of parental support were associated with alcohol and tobacco use among OSY. Household norms, romantic partners and non-smoking or non-drinking friends were suggested to mitigate alcohol and tobacco use. Understanding how the social network of OSY plays a role in alcohol and tobacco use is useful for gaining an insight into the profile of OSY at risk for alcohol and tobacco use. Registration of OSY youth and community-based peer led programmes that include influential OSY family and friends could be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W3093549389,"The relationships between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) measurements not confounded by adiposity and the prevalence of pre-diabetes mellitus (pre-DM) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are not well known. Thus, we aimed to investigate the associations of visceral fat (VF) and CRF with the prevalence of pre-DM/DM among Japanese adults. The study included 970 individuals (327 women and 643 men) who were 40–87 years old and had complete health examinations, abdominal fat area, and fitness data from WASEDA’S Health Study during 2015–2018. The VF area was measured using magnetic resonance imaging. CRF was measured using a cycle ergometer and was defined as VO2peak divided by fat free mass. The pre-DM/DM was identified based on the questionnaire and fasting blood tests. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prevalence of pre-DM/DM were calculated. Seventy-three participants had pre-DM and 48 participants had DM. Compared to the low VF group, the high VF group had a higher prevalence of pre-DM/DM (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.18–2.96), although no significant relationship was observed between CRF and pre-DM/DM prevalence (P for trend = 0.239). The sub-group analyses also revealed no significant relationship between CRF and pre-DM/DM prevalence in the low VF group (P for trend = 0.979), although CRF values were inversely related to the prevalence of pre-DM/DM in the high VF group (P for trend = 0.024). Although CRF was not independently related to the prevalence of pre-DM/DM after adjusting for adiposity, higher VF values were related to a higher prevalence of pre-DM/DM. In addition, CRF levels were inversely associated with the prevalence of pre-DM/DM only among high VF individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3094286354,"The hijab is central to the lives of Muslim women across the world but little is known about the actual effects exerted by this garment on perceptions of the wearer. Indeed, while previous research has suggested that wearing the hijab may affect the physical attractiveness of women, the actual effect of wearing the hijab on perceptions of female facial attractiveness by Muslim men in a Muslim country is largely unknown. Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of the hijab on female facial attractiveness perceived by practising Muslim men living in their native Muslim country (the United Arab Emirates). Participants were presented with frontal-head images of women shown in three conditions: in the fully covered condition, heads were completely covered by the hijab except for the face; in the partially covered condition, heads were completely covered by the hijab except for the face and areas around the forehead and each side of the face and head; in the uncovered condition, heads had no covering at all. The findings revealed that faces where heads were uncovered or partially covered were rated as equally attractive, and both were rated as substantially more attractive than faces where heads were fully covered. Thus, while wearing the hijab can suppress female facial attractiveness to men, these findings suggest that not all hijab wearing has this effect, and female facial attractiveness for practising Muslim men living in their native Muslim country may not be reduced simply by wearing this garment. Indeed, from the findings we report, slight changes to the positioning of the hijab (the partially covered condition) produce perceptions of facial attractiveness that are no lower than when no hijab is worn, and this may have important implications for wearing the hijab in Muslim societies. Finally, we argue that the pattern of effects we observed is not explained by anti-Islamic feeling or cultural endogamy, and that a major contributory factor is that being fully covered by the hijab occludes external features, especially the hair and lateral parts of the head and face, which, when normally visible, provide a substantial perceptual contribution to human facial attractiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3094323898,"As one of the most extensively studied glycosaminoglycan lyases, heparinase I has been used in producing low or ultra-low molecular weight heparin. Its’ important applications are to neutralize the heparin in human blood and analyze heparin structure in the clinic. However, the low productivity and activity of the enzyme have greatly hindered its applications. In this study, a novel Hep-I from Bacteroides cellulosilyticus (BcHep-I) was successfully cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as a soluble protein. The molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of the enzyme are 44.42 kDa and 9.02, respectively. And the characterization of BcHep-I after purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography suggested that it is a mesophilic enzyme. BcHep-I can be activated by 1 mM Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, while severely inhibited by Zn2+, Co2+, and EDTA. The specific activity of the enzyme was 738.3 U·mg-1 which is the highest activity ever reported. The Km and Vmax were calculated as 0.17 mg·mL-1 and 740.58 U·mg-1, respectively. Besides, the half-life of 300 min at 30°C showed BcHep-I has practical applications. Homology modeling and substrate docking revealed that Gln15, Lys74, Arg76, Lys104, Arg149, Gln208, Tyr336, Tyr342, and Lys338 were mainly involved in the substrate binding of Hep-I, and 11 hydrogen bonds were formed between heparin and the enzyme. These results indicated that BcHep-I with high activity has great potential applications in the industrial production of heparin, especially in the clinic to neutralize heparin."

We found cruciform DNA foci exist in transcription active growing oocytes but not in transcription inactive fully grown oocytes and colocalized with Parp1 but not with DNA damage marker γH2A.X. By analyzing the Genotype-Tissue Expression data, we found cruciform DNA-mediated chromosomal translocation in human spermatocytes is associated with the specific DNA transcription in testis. When inhibiting the transcription with α-amanitin in mouse oocytes, we found oocyte cruciform DNA foci decreased significantly. In summary, we observed the endogenous cruciform DNA in growing oocytes and our results showed that the cruciform DNA formation is transcription-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3094092011,"Autoimmune hepatitis (AH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are autoimmune diseases (AIDs) targeting cellular components of the liver. Being rare diseases, limited data are available about familial risks among these AIDs (concordant) or between them and other AIDs (discordant). We aimed to carry out an unbiased study on these AIDs based on medically diagnosed patients. We collected data on patients diagnosed in Swedish hospitals with AH, PBC and other AIDs and calculated familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for concordant and discordant familial relative risks. The number of AH patients was 6,269, of whom 43.0% were male; patient numbers for PBC were 4,269, with 17.8% males. AH accounted for 0.8% and 0.6% of all hospitalized AIDs in Sweden. For AH only the familial risk between siblings was significant (3.83). For PBC the risks for offspring of parents (9.05) and siblings (10.88) were high, but only risk for females was significant. Spousal risks were very high, 5.91 and 6.07 for AH. Risk for AH was 2.21 in families of PBC, and it was 2.47 for PBC in families of AH patients. Among other AIDs, 14 showed a significant association with AH, compared to 16 AIDs with PBC. The surprising finding in this nation-wide family study on medically diagnosed patients was the high risk for AH (6.0) between spouses, which exceed the risk between siblings, suggesting the existence of strong environmental risk factors. AH and PBC were associated with multiple other AIDs. The results call attention to environmental factors in AID etiology which should also be in focus in taking anamnestic data from patients."
https://openalex.org/W3094310259,"Rooting ability of rice seedling for mechanical transplanting has a large impact on grain yield. This study explored the relationship between endogenous soluble sugar content and rooting ability of rice seedlings. We placed 15-day-old rice seedlings in controlled environment cabinets with stable light and sampled after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours of light to measure their soluble sugar content, nitrate content, starch content, soluble protein content and rooting ability. The soluble sugar content of the rice seedlings before rooting increased rapidly from 65.1 mg g-1 to 126.3 mg g-1 in the first 9 hours of light and then tended to stabilize; however, few significant changes in the other physiological indices were detected. With the light exposure time increasing from 3 hours to 12 hours, the rooting ability measured with fresh weight, dry weight, total length, and number of new roots increased by 91.7%, 120.0%, 60.6% and 30.3%, respectively. Rooting ability was related more closely to soluble sugar content than to nitrate-nitrogen content of rice seedlings before rooting and their correlation coefficients were 0.8582–0.8684 and 0.7045–0.7882, respectively. The stepwise regression analysis revealed that the soluble sugar content before rooting explained 73.6%–75.4% of the variance, and the nitrate-nitrogen content explained an additional 7.3%–14.2% of the variance in rooting ability, indicating that compared with nitrate-nitrogen content, soluble sugar content of rice seedlings before rooting was more dominant in affecting rooting ability. This study provides direct evidence of the relationship between the rooting ability and endogenous soluble sugar content of rice seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W3093475977,"Climate change affects individual life-history characteristics and species interactions, including predator-prey interactions. While effects of warming on Aedes aegypti adults are well known, clarity the interactive effects of climate change (temperature and CO2 concentration) and predation risk on the larval stage remains unexplored. In this study, we performed a microcosm experiment simulating temperature and CO2 changes in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, for the year 2100. Simulated climate change scenarios (SCCS) were in accordance with the Fourth Assessment Report of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Used SCCS were: Control (real-time current conditions in Manaus: average temperature is ~25.76°C ± 0.71°C and ~477.26 ± 9.38 parts per million by volume (ppmv) CO2); Light: increase of ~1,7°C and ~218 ppmv CO2; Intermediate: increase of ~2.4°C and ~446 ppmv CO2; and Extreme: increase of ~4.5°C and ~861 ppmv CO2, all increases were relative to a Control SCCS. Light, Intermediate and Extreme SCCS reproduced, respectively, the B1, A1B, and A2 climatic scenarios predicted by IPCC (2007). We analyzed Aedes aegypti larval survivorship and adult emergence pattern with a factorial design combining predation risk (control and predator presence–Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis larvae) and SCCS. Neither SCCS nor predation risk affected Aedes aegypti larval survivorship, but adult emergence pattern was affected by SCCS. Accordingly, our results did not indicate interactive effects of SCCS and predation risk on larval survivorship and emergence pattern of Aedes aegypti reared in SCCS in western Amazonia. Aedes aegypti is resistant to SCCS conditions tested, mainly due to high larval survivorship, even under Extreme SCCS, and warmer scenarios increase adult Aedes aegypti emergence. Considering that Aedes aegypti is a health problem in western Amazonia, an implication of our findings is that the use of predation cues as biocontrol strategies will not provide a viable means of controlling the accelerated adult emergence expected under the IPCC climatic scenarios."

All participants in the three programs practiced three sessions on non-consecutive days per week during the intervention phase. Each participant's performance was assessed before and after six weeks of the program through hitting ten maximal drives with the ball flight and swing analyzed using the P3ProSwing Golf Simulator and recorded for the driver club head speed, driving distance, and driving accuracy. Multivariate analysis of variance showed no statistically significant differences (P < .05) of the performances of the golfers participated in the 3 programs (club head speed: F = 1.02, P = 0.33; accuracy: F = 0.32, P = 0.72; distance: F = 0.18, P = 0.83). Furthermore, a paired t-tests also showed no statistically significant (P < .05) improvement occurred in the 3 programs after the six-week training. Although the effect of the 3 programs did not show statistically significant increase in the performance of the amateur golfers, however, the three parameters of the performance, i.e. the driver club head speed, the driving distance and the driving accuracy showed certain improvements. The 3 training programs may have benefit to the amateur golfers with certain increases of their performance."
https://openalex.org/W3094450003,"There is an old soccer wisdom that a goal scored just before halftime has greater value than other goals. Many dismiss this old wisdom as just another myth waiting to be busted. To test which is right we have analysed the final score difference through linear regression and outcome (win, draw, loss) through logistic regression. We use games from many leagues, control for the halftime score, comparing games in which a goal was scored after 1 minute remained of regulation time with games in which it was scored before the 44th minute. Our main finding is that the home team scoring just before halftime influence these outcomes to its advantage, compared with scoring earlier with the same halftime score. We conclude that a goal scored just before halftime has greater value than other goals provided it is scored by the home team. In other words; the wisdom may be old, but it's still wise."

Although ongoing efforts are attempting to limit the spread of these infections, targeted treatments are necessary to manage the disease. Currently, no tools for genetic manipulation are available to identify and test specific drug targets in these fungi. To facilitate the development of genetic tools in Bd and Bsal, we have tested five commonly used antibiotics with available resistance genes: Hygromycin, Blasticidin, Puromycin, Zeocin, and Neomycin. We have identified effective concentrations of each for selection in both liquid culture and on solid media. These concentrations are within the range of concentrations used for selecting genetically modified cells from a variety of other eukaryotic species."
