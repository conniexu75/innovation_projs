https://openalex.org/W2067346789,"Several cell-surface lipid-tethered proteins exhibit a concentration-independent, cholesterol-sensitive organization of nanoscale clusters and monomers. To understand the mechanism of formation of these clusters, we investigate the spatial distribution and steady-state dynamics of fluorescently tagged GPI-anchored protein nanoclusters using high-spatial and temporal resolution FRET microscopy. These studies reveal a nonrandom spatial distribution of nanoclusters, concentrated in optically resolvable domains. Monitoring the dynamics of recovery of fluorescence intensity and anisotropy, we find that nanoclusters are immobile, and the dynamics of interconversion between nanoclusters and monomers, over a range of temperatures, is spatially heterogeneous and non-Arrhenius, with a sharp crossover coinciding with a reduction in the activity of cortical actin. Cholesterol depletion perturbs cortical actin and the spatial scale and interconversion dynamics of nanoclusters. Direct perturbations of cortical actin activity also affect the construction, dynamics, and spatial organization of nanoclusters. These results suggest a unique mechanism of complexation of cell-surface molecules regulated by cortical actin activity."
https://openalex.org/W2060236569,"Chromosomal translocation requires formation of paired double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) on heterologous chromosomes. One of the most well characterized oncogenic translocations juxtaposes c-myc and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus (IgH) and is found in Burkitt's lymphomas in humans and plasmacytomas in mice. DNA breaks in IgH leading to c-myc/IgH translocations are created by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) during antibody class switch recombination or somatic hypermutation. However, the source of DNA breaks at c-myc is not known. Here, we provide evidence for the c-myc promoter region being required in targeting AID-mediated DNA damage to produce DSBs in c-myc that lead to c-myc/IgH translocations in primary B lymphocytes. Thus, in addition to producing somatic mutations and DNA breaks in antibody genes, AID is also responsible for the DNA lesions in oncogenes that are required for their translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2147290892,"Kinetochore specification and assembly requires the targeted deposition of specialized nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A at centromeres. However, CENP-A is not sufficient to drive full-kinetochore assembly, and it is not clear how centromeric chromatin is established. Here, we identify CENP-W as a component of the DNA-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins. We demonstrate that CENP-W forms a DNA-binding complex together with the CCAN component CENP-T. This complex directly associates with nucleosomal DNA and with canonical histone H3, but not with CENP-A, in centromeric regions. CENP-T/CENP-W functions upstream of other CCAN components with the exception of CENP-C, an additional putative DNA-binding protein. Our analysis indicates that CENP-T/CENP-W and CENP-C provide distinct pathways to connect the centromere with outer kinetochore assembly. In total, our results suggest that the CENP-T/CENP-W complex is directly involved in establishment of centromere chromatin structure coordinately with CENP-A."
https://openalex.org/W2098889694,"The microtubule motor kinesin-1 plays central roles in intracellular transport. It has been widely assumed that many cellular cargos are moved by multiple kinesins and that cargos with more motors move faster and for longer distances; concrete evidence, however, is sparse. Here we rigorously test these notions using lipid droplets in Drosophila embryos. We first employ antibody inhibition, genetics, biochemistry, and particle tracking to demonstrate that kinesin-1 mediates plus-end droplet motion. We then measure how variation in kinesin-1 expression affects the forces driving individual droplets and estimate the number of kinesins actively engaged per droplet. Unlike in vitro, increased motor number results in neither longer travel distances nor higher velocities. Our data suggest that cargos in vivo can simultaneously engage multiple kinesins and that transport properties are largely unaffected by variation in motor number. Apparently, higher-order regulatory mechanisms rather than motor number per se dominate cargo transport in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2109418446,"Vascular development begins when mesodermal cells differentiate into endothelial cells, which then form primitive vessels. It has been hypothesized that endothelial-specific gene expression may be regulated combinatorially, but the transcriptional mechanisms governing specificity in vascular gene expression remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a 44 bp transcriptional enhancer that is sufficient to direct expression specifically and exclusively to the developing vascular endothelium. This enhancer is regulated by a composite cis-acting element, the FOX:ETS motif, which is bound and synergistically activated by Forkhead and Ets transcription factors. We demonstrate that coexpression of the Forkhead protein FoxC2 and the Ets protein Etv2 induces ectopic expression of vascular genes in Xenopus embryos, and that combinatorial knockdown of the orthologous genes in zebrafish embryos disrupts vascular development. Finally, we show that FOX:ETS motifs are present in many known endothelial-specific enhancers and that this motif is an efficient predictor of endothelial enhancers in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1985442801,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of sustained clinical arrhythmia. We previously mapped an AF locus to chromosome 5p13 in an AF family with sudden death in early childhood. Here we show that the specific AF gene underlying this linkage is NUP155, which encodes a member of the nucleoporins, the components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We have identified a homozygous mutation, R391H, in NUP155 that cosegregates with AF, affects nuclear localization of NUP155, and reduces nuclear envelope permeability. Homozygous NUP155(-/-) knockout mice die before E8.5, but heterozygous NUP155(+/-) mice show the AF phenotype. The R391H mutation and reduction of NUP155 are associated with inhibition of both export of Hsp70 mRNA and nuclear import of Hsp70 protein. These human and mouse studies indicate that loss of NUP155 function causes AF by altering mRNA and protein transport and link the NPC to cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2056265881,"We have assembled, annotated, and analyzed a database of over 1700 breakpoints from the most common chromosomal rearrangements in human leukemias and lymphomas. Using this database, we show that although the CpG dinucleotide constitutes only 1% of the human genome, it accounts for 40%-70% of breakpoints at pro-B/pre-B stage translocation regions-specifically, those near the bcl-2, bcl-1, and E2A genes. We do not observe CpG hotspots in rearrangements involving lymphoid-myeloid progenitors, mature B cells, or T cells. The stage specificity, lineage specificity, CpG targeting, and unique breakpoint distributions at these cluster regions may be explained by a lesion-specific double-strand breakage mechanism involving the RAG complex acting at AID-deaminated methyl-CpGs."
https://openalex.org/W2066259947,"Fisheries catches represent a net export of mass and energy that can no longer be used by trophic levels higher than those fished. Thus, exploitation implies a depletion of secondary production of higher trophic levels (here the production of mass and energy by herbivores and carnivores in the ecosystem) due to the removal of prey. The depletion of secondary production due to the export of biomass and energy through catches was recently formulated as a proxy for evaluating the ecosystem impacts of fishing–i.e., the level of ecosystem overfishing. Here we evaluate the historical and current risk of ecosystem overfishing at a global scale by quantifying the depletion of secondary production using the best available fisheries and ecological data (i.e., catch and primary production). Our results highlight an increasing trend in the number of unsustainable fisheries (i.e., an increase in the risk of ecosystem overfishing) from the 1950s to the 2000s, and illustrate the worldwide geographic expansion of overfishing. These results enable to assess when and where fishing became unsustainable at the ecosystem level. At present, total catch per capita from Large Marine Ecosystems is at least twice the value estimated to ensure fishing at moderate sustainable levels."
https://openalex.org/W2065326477,"Basal cells are by definition located on the basolateral side of several epithelia, and they have never been observed reaching the lumen. Using high-resolution 3D confocal imaging, we report that basal cells extend long and slender cytoplasmic projections that not only reach toward the lumen but can cross the tight junction barrier in some epithelia of the male reproductive and respiratory tracts. In this way, the basal cell plasma membrane is exposed to the luminal environment. In the epididymis, in which luminal acidification is crucial for sperm maturation and storage, these projections contain the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2). Activation of AGTR2 by luminal angiotensin II, increases proton secretion by adjacent clear cells, which are devoid of AGTR2. We propose a paradigm in which basal cells scan and sense the luminal environment of pseudostratified epithelia and modulate epithelial function by a mechanism involving crosstalk with other epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2116252849,"Tool use is rare in wild animals, but of widespread interest because of its relationship to animal cognition, social learning and culture. Despite such attention, quantifying the costs and benefits of tool use has been difficult, largely because if tool use occurs, all population members typically exhibit the behavior. In Shark Bay, Australia, only a subset of the bottlenose dolphin population uses marine sponges as tools, providing an opportunity to assess both proximate and ultimate costs and benefits and document patterns of transmission. We compared sponge-carrying (sponger) females to non-sponge-carrying (non-sponger) females and show that spongers were more solitary, spent more time in deep water channel habitats, dived for longer durations, and devoted more time to foraging than non-spongers; and, even with these potential proximate costs, calving success of sponger females was not significantly different from non-spongers. We also show a clear female-bias in the ontogeny of sponging. With a solitary lifestyle, specialization, and high foraging demands, spongers used tools more than any non-human animal. We suggest that the ecological, social, and developmental mechanisms involved likely (1) help explain the high intrapopulation variation in female behaviour, (2) indicate tradeoffs (e.g., time allocation) between ecological and social factors and, (3) constrain the spread of this innovation to primarily vertical transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1970934635,"Background The blood based interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis do not discriminate between active TB disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). The search for distinguishing biomarkers therefore continues, as the accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis is particularly challenging in children. IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10) has recently been evaluated as a marker for active TB in adults with promising results. Aim To investigate this new biomarker for active TB and LTBI in paediatrics. Method We measured IP-10 levels using ELISA in supernatants of whole blood samples stimulated with TB-specific-antigens and negative control antigen. Results IP-10 is produced in high levels following mycobacterial antigen stimulation in active TB (n = 17) and LTBI (n = 16) compared to controls (n = 16) and to IFN-γ. The baseline levels of IP-10 are increased in active TB and in LTBI, but there is no significant difference of stimulated levels of IP-10 between active TB and LTBI. Conclusions IP-10 is a biomarker for tuberculosis in children. However like IFNγ, IP-10 also does not distinguish between active TB and LTBI."
https://openalex.org/W2093632126,"Although the most common mechanism underlying congenital hyperinsulinism is dysfunction of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium channel, the pathogenesis and genetic origins of this disease remains largely unexplained in more than half of all patients. UCP2 knockout mice exhibit an hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, suggesting an involment of UCP2 in insulin secretion. However, a possible pathogenic role for UCP2 protein in the development of human congenital hyperinsulinism or of any human disease has not yet been investigated. We studied ten children exhibiting congenital hyperinsulinism, without detectable mutations in the known congenital hyperinsulinism-causing genes. Parental-inherited heterozygous UCP2 variants encoding amino-acid changes were found in two unrelated children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Functional assays in yeast and in insulin-secreting cells revealed an impaired activity of UCP2 mutants. Therefore, we report the finding of UCP2 coding variants in human congenital hyperinsulinism, which reveals a role for this gene in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism in humans. Our results show for the first time a direct association between UCP2 amino acid alteration and human disease and highlight a role for mitochondria in hormone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2094393593,"Background We and others have reported that rapid ischemic postconditioning, interrupting early reperfusion after stroke, reduces infarction in rats. However, its extremely short therapeutic time windows, from a few seconds to minutes after reperfusion, may hinder its clinical translation. Thus, in this study we explored if delayed postconditioning, which is conducted a few hours after reperfusion, offers protection against stroke. Methods and Results Focal ischemia was generated by 30 min occlusion of bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) combined with permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA); delayed postconditioning was performed by repetitive, brief occlusion and release of the bilateral CCAs, or of the ipsilateral CCA alone. As a result, delayed postconditioning performed at 3h and 6h after stroke robustly reduced infarct size, with the strongest protection achieved by delayed postconditioning with 6 cycles of 15 min occlusion/15 min release of the ipsilateral CCA executed from 6h. We found that this delayed postconditioning provided long-term protection for up to two months by reducing infarction and improving outcomes of the behavioral tests; it also attenuated reduction in 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-uptake therefore improving metabolism, and reduced edema and blood brain barrier leakage. Reperfusion in ischemic stroke patients is usually achieved by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) application, however, t-PA's side effect may worsen ischemic injury. Thus, we tested whether delayed postconditioning counteracts the exacerbating effect of t-PA. The results showed that delayed postconditioning mitigated the worsening effect of t-PA on infarction. Conclusion Delayed postconditioning reduced ischemic injury after focal ischemia, which opens a new research avenue for stroke therapy and its underlying protective mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2140946521,"Faces are processed by a neural system with distributed anatomical components, but the roles of these components remain unclear. A dominant theory of face perception postulates independent representations of invariant aspects of faces (e.g., identity) in ventral temporal cortex including the fusiform gyrus, and changeable aspects of faces (e.g., emotion) in lateral temporal cortex including the superior temporal sulcus. Here we recorded neuronal activity directly from the cortical surface in 9 neurosurgical subjects undergoing epilepsy monitoring while they viewed static and dynamic facial expressions. Applying novel decoding analyses to the power spectrogram of electrocorticograms (ECoG) from over 100 contacts in ventral and lateral temporal cortex, we found better representation of both invariant and changeable aspects of faces in ventral than lateral temporal cortex. Critical information for discriminating faces from geometric patterns was carried by power modulations between 50 to 150 Hz. For both static and dynamic face stimuli, we obtained a higher decoding performance in ventral than lateral temporal cortex. For discriminating fearful from happy expressions, critical information was carried by power modulation between 60–150 Hz and below 30 Hz, and again better decoded in ventral than lateral temporal cortex. Task-relevant attention improved decoding accuracy more than10% across a wide frequency range in ventral but not at all in lateral temporal cortex. Spatial searchlight decoding showed that decoding performance was highest around the middle fusiform gyrus. Finally, we found that the right hemisphere, in general, showed superior decoding to the left hemisphere. Taken together, our results challenge the dominant model for independent face representation of invariant and changeable aspects: information about both face attributes was better decoded from a single region in the middle fusiform gyrus."
https://openalex.org/W2024350759,"The influenza virus polymerase is formed by the PB1, PB2 and PA subunits and is required for virus transcription and replication in the nucleus of infected cells. As PB2 is a relevant host-range determinant we expressed a TAP-tagged PB2 in human cells and isolated intracellular complexes. Alpha-importin was identified as a PB2-associated factor by proteomic analyses. To study the relevance of this interaction for virus replication we mutated the PB2 NLS and analysed the phenotype of mutant subunits, polymerase complexes and RNPs. While mutant PB2 proteins showed reduced nuclear accumulation, they formed polymerase complexes normally when co expressed with PB1 and PA. However, mutant RNPs generated with a viral CAT replicon showed up to hundred-fold reduced CAT accumulation. Rescue of nuclear localisation of mutant PB2 by insertion of an additional SV40 TAg-derived NLS did not revert the mutant phenotype of RNPs. Furthermore, determination of recombinant RNP accumulation in vivo indicated that PB2 NLS mutations drastically reduced virus RNA replication. These results indicate that, above and beyond its role in nuclear accumulation, PB2 interaction with α-importins is required for virus RNA replication. To ascertain whether PB2-α-importin binding could contribute to the adaptation of H5N1 avian viruses to man, their association in vivo was determined. Human alpha importin isoforms associated efficiently to PB2 protein of an H3N2 human virus but bound to diminished and variable extents to PB2 from H5N1 avian or human strains, suggesting that the function of alpha importin during RNA replication is important for the adaptation of avian viruses to the human host."
https://openalex.org/W1973764129,"Understanding the general features of speciation is an important goal in evolutionary biology, and despite significant progress, several unresolved questions remain. We analyzed an extensive comparative dataset consisting of more than 1900 crosses between 92 species of toads to infer patterns of reproductive isolation. This unique dataset provides an opportunity to examine the strength of reproductive isolation, the development and sex ratios of hybrid offspring, patterns of fertility and infertility, and polyploidization in hybrids all in the context of genetic divergence between parental species. We found that the strength of intrinsic postzygotic isolation increases with genetic divergence, but relatively high levels of divergence are necessary before reproductive isolation is complete in toads. Fertilization rates were not correlated to genetic divergence, but hatching success, the number of larvae produced, and the percentage of tadpoles reaching metamorphosis were all inversely related with genetic divergence. Hybrids between species with lower levels of divergence developed to metamorphosis, while hybrids with higher levels of divergence stopped developing in gastrula and larval stages. Sex ratios of hybrid offspring were biased towards males in 70% of crosses and biased towards females in 30% of crosses. Hybrid females from crosses between closely related species were completely fertile, while approximately half (53%) of hybrid males were sterile, with sterility predicted by genetic divergence. The degree of abnormal ploidy in hybrids was positively related to genetic divergence between parental species, but surprisingly, polyploidization had no effect on patterns of asymmetrical inviability. We discuss explanations for these patterns, including the role of Haldane's rule in toads and anurans in general, and suggest mechanisms generating patterns of reproductive isolation in anurans."
https://openalex.org/W2063651589,"UCP2 and UCP3, two novel uncoupling proteins, are important regulators of energy expenditure and thermogenesis in various organisms. The striking disparity between UCP2 mRNA and protein levels in muscle tissues prompted initial speculation that microRNAs are implicated in the regulatory pathway of UCP2. We found, for the first time, that the repression of UCP2 expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle resulted from its targeting by a muscle-specific microRNA, miR-133a. Moreover, our findings illustrate a novel function of UCP2 as a brake for muscle development. We also show that MyoD can remove the braking role of UCP2 via direct up-regulation of miR-133a during myogenic differentiation.

UCPs are mitochondrial inner membrane transporters that uncouple ATP synthesis by dissipating the proton gradient, a process that generates heat and decreases ATP production (1Krauss S. Zhang C.Y.

UCPs have been described across various animal and plant species, and they are prominent in the fields of thermogenesis, obesity, diabetes, and free radical biology (1Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B.

In contrast to UCP1, the arche-typal uncoupling protein, the exact physiological functions of UCP2 remain obscure (1Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Lowell B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol.

One of the main puzzles encountered in the studies of UCP2 is the ambiguous regulatory mechanisms controlling its expression. Previous study has suggested that the expression of UCP2 mRNA in a specific tissue does not necessarily correlate with the expression at the protein level. For example, although UCP2 mRNA is found in mouse heart and skeletal muscle, no UCP2 protein could be detected in these tissues (3Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M.C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Given the disparity between UCP2 mRNA and protein in mouse muscle tissues, it is quite likely that a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism exists. Recently, a class of RNA regulatory genes known as microRNAs (miRNAs) has been found to introduce a whole new layer of protein regulation after transcription (4Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28991) Google Scholar). miRNAs act as endogenous sequence-specific suppressors of translation and thus can block target protein expression without affecting mRNA stability (4Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28991) Google Scholar). Their widespread and important role in eukaryotes is highlighted by recent discoveries that they control a range of physiological processes including development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism (4Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28991) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified UCP2 as a target of the muscle-specific miR-133a and demonstrated that UCP2 plays a role in inhibiting muscle differentiation and promoting myoblast proliferation. Therefore, we suggested that down-regulation of UCP2 might be an indispensable step during myogenic differentiation. The specific mechanism through which miR-133a and UCPs regulate the myogenic pathway has also been well described in this study.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Mouse lung fibroblast cells L929, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma cells LLC, and mouse mesenchymal stem cells C2C12 were obtained from China Cell Culture Center (Shanghai, China). L929 and LLC cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 myoblasts were maintained at subconfluent densities in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). When cells reached ∼75% confluence, the medium was switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum). Medium was changed every other day. After incubation for several days, cells were harvested and subjected to various experiments. Antibodies, including anti-UCP2 (C-20), anti-UCP3 (C-20), anti-MyoD (M-318), anti-cytochrome c (A-8), and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (6C5), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Precursor oligonucleotides (pre-miR-133a, pre-miR-1, and pre-miR-210), antisense oligonucleotides (anti-miR-133a), and scrambled negative control oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion.PCR Analysis—Assays to quantify mature miRNAs were conducted as described previously (5Chen C.F. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z.H. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (3969) Google Scholar). For real-time PCR analysis, the relative amount of each gene to internal control was calculated by using the equation 2-ΔCT, in which ΔCT = CTgene-CTcontrol. For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis, 20-30 PCR cycles were performed. All primers used are listed in supplemental Table 1.Overexpression or Knockdown of miR-133a—L929, LLC, or C2C12 cells were seeded on 6-well plates or 60-mm dishes and were transfected the following day by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each well, equal doses of precursor oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides, or scrambled negative control RNA were used. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for semiquantitative RT-PCR, real-time PCR analysis, and Western blotting.Plasmid Construction and Luciferase Assay—The entire mouse UCP2 3′-untranslated region (UTR) segment was amplified by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as a template. The PCR products were inserted into the p-MIR-report plasmid (Ambion). Efficient insertion was confirmed by sequencing. For luciferase reporter assays, 1 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (Ambion), and equal amounts (200 pmol) of pre-miR-133a, anti-miR-133a, or scrambled negative control RNA were transfected into cells in 6-well plates. The β-galactosidase vector was used as a transfection control. At 24 h after transfection, cells were assayed using luciferase assay kits (Promega).Cloning of miR-133a—The genomic fragment of pre-miR-133a-1 from mouse chromosomes 18 was amplified by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as a template. The PCR products were cloned into the pcDNA(-)3.1 vector (Invitrogen), and effective overexpression was qualified by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis after transfecting the expression vector into L929 cells.Isolation of Mitochondria and Western Blotting—Mitochondria of UCP2 knock-out mice (gift from Bradford B. Lowell, Harvard University), wild type mice and culture cells were isolated as described previously (6Krauss S. Zhang C.Y. Scorrano L. Dalgaard L.T. St-Pierre J. Grey S.T. Lowell B.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). UCP2 or UCP3 protein levels were quantified by Western blot analysis of 50 μg of mitochondrial proteins with antibodies against UCP2 or UCP3. Normalization was performed by blotting the same samples with an antibody to cytochrome c. The MyoD protein level was quantified by Western blot analysis of 100 μg of whole cell extracts with antibodies against MyoD, and the normalization was performed by blotting the same sample with an anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody.ChIP Experiments—Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (7O'Donnell K.A. Wentzel E.A. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Mendell J.T. Nature. 2005; 435: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Briefly, C2C12 cells were maintained in differentiation medium (DM) for 3 days and then cross-linked with formaldehyde. Cell extracts were sonicated to generate 200-1000-bp DNA fragments. Rabbit polyclonal anti-MyoD antibody and rabbit IgG were used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. The DNA-protein cross-links were reversed by heating at 65 °C for 4 h, and the recovered DNA was PCR-amplified. In the PCR analysis, 26, 20, and 48 PCR amplicons roughly 200 bp in length were designed to assay for binding sites in the 5-kb sequence upstream of pre-miR-133a-1, the 5-kb sequence upstream of pre-miR-133a-2, and the 10-kb sequence upstream of UCP3. Control amplification was carried out on input chromatin before immunoprecipitation and on mock-immunoprecipitated chromatin.Statistical Analysis—All photo images of Western blotting, semiquantitative RT-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were representatives of at least three independent experiments. Real-time PCR and luciferase reporter assay were performed in triplicate, and the entire experiment was repeated several times. Data shown were presented as means ± S.E. of three or more independent experiments, and the differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 by using the Student's t test.RESULTSRegulation of UCP2 Expression by miR-133a—We first investigated the distribution of UCP2 mRNA and protein in mouse tissues. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of UCP2 protein in spleen and lung (Fig. 1A). This detection was specific because the 33-kDa band detected by the antibody disappeared in ucp2-/- mice (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, we were unable to detect UCP2 protein in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 1A) despite a clear identification of UCP2 mRNA in these tissues (Fig. 1B). Moreover, this disparity between protein and mRNA in mouse muscle tissues seemed specific for UCP2; both the protein and the mRNA of UCP3, the most homologous of UCP2 in UCPs, were normally expressed in mouse muscle tissues (Fig. 1, B and C).Because UCP2 protein is absent from mouse muscle tissues but is highly expressed in other tissues, it is intriguing to speculate that muscle-specific miRNAs modulate the expression of UCP2. Overall, four muscle-specific miRNAs have been identified: miR-1, miR-133a, miR-206, and miR-208 (8Chen J.F. Mandel E.M. Thomson J.M. Wu Q.L. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z. Nat.

Sutherland L.B. Qi X.X. Richardson J.A. Hill J. Olson E.N. Science. 2007; 316: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Previous work has reported that miR-1 and miR-133a are specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (8Chen J.F. Mandel E.M. Thomson J.M. Wu Q.L. Callis T.E. Hammond S.M. Conlon F.L. Wang D.Z. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), whereas miR-206 and miR-208 are expressed only in skeletal muscle or cardiac muscle, respectively (9Anderson C. Catoe H. Werner R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 10van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Qi X.X. Richardson J.A. Hill J. Olson E.N. Science. 2007; 316: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Given the absence of miR-206 from heart and miR-208 from skeletal muscle, we then focused on miR-1 and miR-133a. As expected, our PCR analysis revealed that mature miR-1 and miR-133a were strictly limited to cardiac and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1, B and D).The correlation between miRNAs and UCP2 was further examined by evaluating the expression of UCP2 after overexpression or knockdown of miRNAs. In these experiments, overexpression of miRNAs was achieved by transfecting cells with pre-miRNAs (synthetic RNA oligonucleotides mimicking miRNA precursors), whereas knockdown was achieved by transfecting cells with anti-miRNAs (chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides designed to specifically target against mature miRNAs). As shown in Fig. 2A, three exogenous pre-miRNAs, pre-miR-1, pre-miR-133a, and an unrelated miRNA precursor pre-miR-210, were introduced into the mouse lung fibroblast cell line L929. UCP2 levels were assayed with mitochondrial proteins isolated on day 2 after transfection. Control experiments were performed in the same manner except using cells transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (negative control) or UCP2 siRNA (positive control). L929 cells were selected for this experiment because they expressed low levels of endogenous miR-1 and miR-133a but a high level of UCP2 protein (supplemental Fig. 1). The expression of UCP2 was significantly abolished by the introduction of pre-miR-133a or UCP2 siRNA, whereas cells treated with pre-miR-1, pre-miR-210, or scrambled oligonucleotides maintained a considerable protein level of UCP2 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, anti-miR-133a significantly delayed the down-regulation of UCP2 by pre-miR-133a. As shown in Fig. 2B, although pre-miR-133a alone was sufficient to reduce UCP2 protein level, cells treated with pre-miR-133a plus anti-miR-133a expressed constant UCP2 protein when compared with control cells treated with scrambled oligonucleotides. To determine at which level miR-133a influenced UCP2 expression, UCP2 transcript levels were evaluated after pre-miR-133a or anti-miR-133a treatment. Although miR-133a intracellular level was altered significantly after pre-miR-133a or anti-miR-133a treatment (Fig. 2C), overexpression or knockdown of miR-133a did not affect UCP2 mRNA stability (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these results confirm that miR-133a blocks UCP2 translation without affecting its mRNA abundance, a hallmark of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. Subsequently, the entire UCP2 3′-UTR was fused into a luciferase reporter plasmid, and the resulting plasmid was introduced into L929 cells combined with a transfection control plasmid (β-galactosidase) and pre-miR-133a, pre-miR-1, pre-miR-210, or scrambled oligonucleotides. As expected, overexpression of miR-133a resulted in a ∼60% reduction of firefly luciferase reporter activity (normalized against β-galactosidase activity) when compared with the scrambled oligonucleotides transfected cells (Fig. 2E). In contrast, pre-miR-1 and pre-miR-210 did not significantly affect the luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2E). The observed alteration of luciferase activity was specific because co-transfection of L929 cells with the parental luciferase plasmid (without the UCP2 3′-UTR) and pre-miR-133a did not affect luciferase activity (Fig. 2E). To narrow down the miR-133a-responsive element, our in silico analysis further identified an ∼0.5-kb region that is most likely responsible for the down-modulation of UCP2 in muscle tissues. As shown in Fig. 2F, three hybrids in this region were observed. The predicted free energy values of these hybrids (-23.7, -21.9, and -21.6 kcal/mol) were all well within the range of true miRNA-target pairs. Subsequently, we constructed an equivalent luciferase reporter with these three putative miR-133a binding sites mutated (the sequence that interacts with the 2-4 bases of miR-133a were mutated). Mutant luciferase reporter was unaffected by overexpression of miR-133a (Fig. 2E). Thus, this region is likely the core sequence through which miR-133a recognizes UCP2 transcripts. Besides L929, the mouse lung cancer cell line LLC, which expressed neither endogenous UCP2 nor endogenous miR-133a (supplemental Fig. 1), was also used in the present study. As anticipated, the effect of overexpression of miR-133a in LLC cells was concordant with that in L929 cells. Overexpression of miR-133a significantly affected luciferase reporter activity, whereas anti-miR-133a could relieve the suppression of pre-miR-133a on UCP2 (Fig. 2G). These results unequivocally demonstrate that miR-133a directly recognizes the 3′-UTR of UCP2 transcripts. In addition to a chemically synthetic miRNA mimic, an expression plasmid of miR-133a was also constructed and transfected into L929 and LLC cells along with luciferase reporters. As shown in Fig. 2H, luciferase activity was markedly repressed by overexpression of miR-133a. In conclusion, these experiments unequivocally demonstrate that miR-133a directly represses UCP2 translation through a post-transcriptional mechanism.FIGURE 2Regulation of UCP2 expression by miR-133a.

C2C12 cells were propagated as undifferentiated, mononucleated myoblasts under high serum conditions. Upon serum depletion, mononucleated myoblasts fused to each other to form multinucleate myotubes (11Soulez M. Rouviere C.G. Chafey P. Hentzen D. Vandromme M. Lautredou N. Lamb N. Kahn A. Tuil D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The differentiation in this model system was very efficient, as indicated by marked induction of myogenic markers including myogenin, myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3A, MHC), MyoD, MEF2, and skeletal α-actin (Fig. 3A, sk.a-actin). Accelerated myogenic differentiation was accompanied by a decrease in cell proliferation, as indicated by a significant decrease in expression of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig. 3A). MiR-133a was also robustly induced during the myoblast-myotube transition. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the undifferentiated myoblasts in proliferative condition did not express miR-133a. Upon differentiation into myotubes, a strong up-regulation of miR-133a was observed. UCP2 transcripts were detectable in undifferentiated primary myoblasts, but their steady-state levels increased many folds and then remained constant during the myoblast-myotube transition (Fig. 3, A and C). However, UCP2 proteins were present in proliferative myoblasts but nearly completely eliminated in differentiated myotubes (Fig. 3D) despite an increase in mRNA expression. In sharp contrast, both UCP3 transcripts and proteins were undetectable in myoblasts but strongly induced upon differentiation (Fig. 3, A and D). Hence, miR-133a and UCP3 levels were inversely related to UCP2 levels in a manner consistent with muscle development. To further investigate the suppression of elevated endogenous miR-133a on UCP2 during myogenic differentiation, we transfected proliferative myoblasts with wild type or mutant luciferase reporter plasmids. Because the luciferase activity generally wanes after a long time of cell culture, reporter activity continued to be reduced throughout the differentiation process (Fig. 3E). However, the accelerated reduction of wild type plasmid when compared with mutant plasmid (Fig. 3E) suggests that endogenous miR-133a may partially contribute to the drop of luciferase activity. Furthermore, anti-miR-133a oligonucleotides significantly delayed the reduction of luciferase activity during myogenesis, whereas pre-miR-133a hastened the drop of luciferase activity when compared with scrambled negative control oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that exogenous antisense oligonucleotides could partially rescue the suppression of endogenous miR-133a on UCP2. In summary, both the loss of UCP2 protein upon myotube formation without a similar reduction in mRNA and the constant inhibition of a luciferase reporter carrying the UCP2 3′-UTR during myogenic differentiation demonstrate a miRNA-mediated UCP2 translational repression mechanism.FIGURE 3The braking role of UCP2 in myogenic differentiation. A-D, C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (GM) or transferred into DM for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days. Semiquantitative PCR analysis of the expression of the indicated genes (A), real-time PCR analysis of miR-133a (B) and UCP2 transcripts (C), Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins (D) were performed. E, luciferase reporters carrying either wild type (WT) or mutant (Mut) UCP2 3′-UTR were co-transfected into C2C12 myoblasts with the indicated oligonucleotides.

PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The continuous suppression of UCP2 and induction of UCP3 during myogenesis prompt the speculation that the down-regulation of UCP2 and up-regulation of UCP3 might be indispensable to myotube formation. To verify this hypothesis, a UCP2 expression plasmid designed to specially express the UCP2 open reading frame (ORF) without the miR-133a-responsive 3′-UTR was constructed. We transfected this plasmid into C2C12 cells to rescue the suppressive effect of miR-133a on UCP2. Strikingly, miR-133a-resistant UCP2 strongly inhibited differentiation but enhanced proliferation of C2C12 cells, as indicated by the dramatic decrease of myogenin, myosin heavy chain, MyoD, MEF2, and skeletal α-actin and the marked increase of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Fig. 3, F-H, PCNA). UCP2 siRNA significantly attenuated this effect of UCP2 because cells co-transfected with the UCP2 ORF and UCP2 siRNA exhibited constant levels of myogenic and proliferative markers when compared with green fluorescent protein transfected cells (Fig. 3F, GFP). In contrast, overexpression of UCP3 caused only a slight reduction of myogenic markers and had almost no effect on proliferative markers (Fig. 3, F and H). Despite their structural and functional similarities, therefore, UCPs may play different roles in muscle cell differentiation. UCP2 may play a role at an earlier stage in the differentiation process, perhaps in maintaining the undifferentiated state and promoting myoblasts proliferation. On the other hand, miR-133a may serve to maintain and define cell types by suppressing unwanted UCP2 transcripts. Alternatively, the loss of basal UCP2 functions (e.g. mediating proton leak and controlling the production of reactive oxygen species) are compensated for by UCP3, which has a comparatively lower impact on muscle development. Hence, down-regulation of UCP2 and up-regulation of miR-133a may form a checkpoint of the myoblast-myotube transition. Taken together, our findings illustrate a novel function of UCP2 in fine-tuning myogenic differentiation of muscle cells.The Model of UCPs and miR-133a-mediated Myogenic Differentiation Pathway—The observation that both miR-133a and UCP3 are specifically up-regulated during myogenesis leads to the hypothesis that their activation may be controlled by myogenic transcription factors. Therefore, two computer-aided algorithms, MATCH (12Kel A.E. Gossling E. Reuter I. Cheremushkin E. Kel-Margoulis O.V. Wingender E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3576-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and PROMO (13Messeguer X. Escudero R. Farre D. Nunez O. Martinez J. Alba M. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), were employed to search for putative myogenic transcription factor binding sites in miR-133a and UCP3 regulatory regions. A 5-kb sequence upstream from the pre-miR-133a-1 stem loop on chromosome 18, a 5-kb sequence upstream from pre-miR-133a-2 on chromosome 2, and a 10-kb sequence upstream from UCP3 start codon were screened. Within these regions, several cis elements conserved across species were noted (data not shown). These elements represented potential binding sites for essential myogenic transcription factors like MyoD, MEF2, serum response factor, and GATA-binding protein 4. Because MyoD has long been thought to represent the core regulators of myogenesis (14Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ChIP was used to determine whether miR-133a and UCP3 are direct transcriptional targets of MyoD. MyoD is known to bind to the canonical CANNTG sequence known as the E-box (14Olson E.N. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Berkes C.A. Tapscott S.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). As anticipated, ChIP assays using antibody against MyoD showed robust PCR product enrichment indicative of MyoD binding at -2.1 kb and -4.1 kb upstream from pre-miR-133a-1, -2.3 kb and -4.1 kb upstream from pre-miR-133a-2, and -6.7 kb and -9.7 kb upstream from UCP3 (Fig. 4, A and B).

To understand this process, deletion analysis was used to identify the region of eIF3-f that is required for its proteolysis. Here, we report that the highly conserved C-terminal domain of eIF3-f is implicated for MAFbx-directed polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis of eIF3-f revealed that the six lysine residues within this domain are required for full polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In addition, mutation of these six lysines (mutant K5–10R) displayed hypertrophic activity in cellulo and in vivo and was able to protect against starvation-induced muscle atrophy. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the C-terminal modifications, believed to be critical for proper eIF3-f regulation, are essential and contribute to a fine-tuning mechanism that plays an important role for eIF3-f function in skeletal muscle.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that the C-terminal modifications, believed to be critical for proper eIF3-f regulation, are essential and contribute to a fine-tuning mechanism that plays an important role for eIF3-f function in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue that has the capacity to continuously regulate its size in response to a variety of external cues including mechanical load, neural activity, hormones/growth factors, stress, and nutritional status. In addition, skeletal muscle serves as the most significant repository for protein in the body, a source that is tapped to provide a pool of amino acids for tissue repair and gluconeogenesis under conditions of starvation and other stresses. The maintenance of muscle mass is controlled by a fine balance between catabolic and anabolic processes, which determine the level of muscle proteins and the diameter of muscle fibers. Muscle loss occurs as the result of a number of disparate conditions including cancer, diabetes, AIDS, sepsis, renal failure, aging, cachexia, and other systemic diseases (1Tisdale M.J. J. Support. Oncol. 2005; 3: 209-217PubMed Google Scholar). These diverse conditions result in reduced protein synthesis and increased protein breakdown. The process of atrophy is characterized by the activation of the ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis pathway (2Jagoe R.T. Goldberg A.L. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2001; 4: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Proteins destined for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are marked by covalent linkage with a chain of ubiquitin molecules (Ub) 3The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; MAFbx, muscle atrophy F-box; eIF3, eukaryotic initiation factor 3; eIF3-f, eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit f; eIF1, eukaryotic initiation factor 1; eIF4F, eukaryotic initiation factor 4F; eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E; MyHC, myosin heavy chain; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; TA, tibialis anterior; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K1, ribosomal S6 kinase 1; rpS6, ribosomal protein S6; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; 4E-BP1, eIF4E-binding protein 1; CHX, cycloheximide; E1, Ub-activating enzyme; E2, Ub-conjugating enzyme; E3, Ub ligase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type. on lysine residue(s) for further degradation into short peptides by the 26 S proteasome. This process requires an Ub-activating enzyme (E1), an Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and an Ub ligase (E3) that acts as the last step of the cascade (3Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). E3 proteins regulate the timing and the substrate specificity in protein degradation. In multiple models of skeletal muscle atrophy, the muscle-specific F-box protein MAFbx/Atrogin-1 (MAFbx) is up-regulated and appears to be essential for accelerated muscle protein loss (4Gomes M.D. Lecker S.H.

Moreover, knock-out animals lacking MAFbx show a reduced rate of muscle atrophy after denervation (5Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K. Nunez L. Clarke B.A. Poueymirou W.T. Panaro F.J. Na E.

These observations suggest a major role for MAFbx in regulating muscle size via its participation in a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase complex. Recently, we demonstrated that MAFbx interacts physically with the f-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 (eIF3-f) for polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation during skeletal muscle atrophy (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). eIF3 is a multisubunit complex with an apparent molecular mass of ∼650 kDa. It plays an important role in translation by binding directly to the 40 S ribosomal subunit and promoting the formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex, consisting of the Met-tRNA-eIF2-GTP ternary complex, eIF1, eIF1A, and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (8Fracer C.S.

Furthermore, eIF3 interacts with the eIF4F-mRNA complex, thus facilitating the binding of mRNA to the 43 S ribosomal complex, thereby forming the 48 S complex. Mammalian eIF3 is composed of at least 13 non-identical subunits, among which is the regulatory subunit eIF3-f. eIF3-f is a member of the Mov34 family, containing an Mpr1/Pad N-terminal (MPN) motif, which is found in certain subunits in two macromolecular complexes, homologous to eIF3, the COP9 signalosome, and the lid of the 19 S proteasome (10Hoffmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 204-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). eIF3-f function within the eIF3 complex remains to be defined. However, eIF3-f is essential for Schizosaccharomyces pombe viability, and its depletion markedly decreases the global protein synthesis in fission yeast (11Zhou C. Arslan F. Wee S. Krishnan S. Ivanov A.R. Oliva A. Leatherwood J. Wolf D.A. BMC Biol. 2005; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The same effect on protein translation was recently described in cells infected with the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coV) and coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (12Xiao H. Xu L.H. Yamada Y. Liu D.X. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In humans, down-regulation of eIF3-f is associated with several tumors (13Doldan A. Chandramouli A.

Leong S.P. Nelson M.A. Shi J. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 806-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and when overexpressed, eIF3-f negatively regulates cell growth by affecting translation efficiency and activation of apoptosis (15Shi J. Kahle A. Hershey J.W. Honchak B.M. Warneke J.A. Leong S.P. Nelson M.A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4923-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, overexpression of eIF3-f induces a marked hypertrophy associated with an increase of sarcomeric proteins such as myosin heavy chain, troponin T, and desmin (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific targeting of eIF3-f by the SCFMAFbx may account for the decreased protein synthesis observed in multiple types of skeletal muscle atrophy by specific translation inhibition of key muscle proteins expression (reviewed in Ref. 16Csibi A. Tintignac L.A. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1698-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have mapped the regions of eIF3-f responsible for its MAFbx-mediated ubiquitination. We show that multiple lysine residues located in the C-terminal domain of eIF3-f are required for its polyubiquitination. Preventing polyubiquitination of eIF3-f by point mutations (K5–10R) leads to stabilization of the protein. (K5–10R indicates point mutations in which lysines are sequentially replaced by arginine (Lys → Arg) starting by lysine 218 (K5) to lysine 357 (K10).) We also demonstrate that the eIF3-f mutant K5–10R induces a strong hypertrophic phenotype in cellulo and in vivo. Finally, overexpression of eIF3-f K5–10R shows an enhanced ability in avoiding skeletal muscle atrophy. Taken together, these data suggest that the ubiquitination of eIF3-f on C-terminal lysine residues may serve two functions: in addressing protein degradation specifically by the SCFMAFbx during skeletal muscle atrophy and in regulating the translation of specific pool of mRNA of key sarcomeric proteins.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). eIF3-f mutants were obtained by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange multi site-directed PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Cultures—The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% of fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Myoblast fusion and differentiation was induced in subconfluent cells by replacing the medium with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 2% fetal calf serum. Primary cultures were prepared from male mice from our own breeding stocks. All animals were treated in accordance with institutional and national guidelines. Briefly, mice satellite cells were isolated from the whole muscles of the paw. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cell/cm2 on Matrigel-coated Petri dishes (BD Biosciences) in 80% Ham's-F10 medium containing glutamine, penicillin, and amphotericin B (Invitrogen), supplemented with 20% horse serum. After 2 days, cells were washed with Ham's-F10 and placed in complete medium supplemented with 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor. Atrophy was induced in cultured myotubes by switching the medium to PBS (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2) for 6 h. Primary cultures of satellite cells were transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid using DreamFect (OZ Biosciences). C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in 36-mm dishes and transfected with 3 μg of total plasmid by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). High level transfection efficiency for C2C12 myoblasts was achieved by using a modified protocol for Lipofectamine 2000. Freshly trypsinized myoblasts were transfected 30 min after plating (300 × 103 cells/36-mm dish) with a 2:1 ratio (μl/μg) of Lipofectamine 2000 (10 μl/36-mm dish) to plasmid DNA (5 μg/36-mm dish). An expression vector coding for the GFP protein was transfected as control of transfection efficacy. GFP expression level in cells was the same. For cycloheximide and MG132 treatments (see Figs. 1A and 2, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1), cells were transfected with expression vectors as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, pooled, and redistributed in the number of necessary wells for the experiment to homogenize the transfection and protein expression levels for half-life or proteasome stabilization determinations.FIGURE 2Mutation of the C-terminal lysine residues suppresses polyubiquitination and stabilizes eIF3-f. A, C2C12 myoblasts were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ubiquitin, FLAG-eIF3-f wild type, FLAG eIF3-f K5–10R, GFP-MAFbx wild type, and/or GFP-MAFbx ΔF-box. Transfected cells were treated 2 h with MG132 (30 μm) before being harvested. Cell lysates were then diluted in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (middle panel), and analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-HA, anti-FLAG, and anti-GFP antibodies (lower panels). B, the cells were treated with CHX 36 h after transfection to block protein synthesis. Cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times and analyzed by immunoblotting (left panel). C, C2C12 cells were cotransfected with the expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged eIF3-f WT and/or the mutant K5–10R and HA-tagged MAFbx. Cells were treated with CHX as described in panel B and analyzed by immunoblotting.

The Perfect Image version 5.5 software (Claravision, France) was used to measure diameters of at least 150 myotubes in a region where myonuclei were absent and the diameter was constant. Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, and Antibodies—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were made essentially as described (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P.

Analyses of the mobilities of differently phosphorylated forms of 4-EBP1 and phosphorylated ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) were made as described previously (18Beugnet A. Tee A. Taylor P.M. Proud C. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Following electrophoretic transfer from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes, they were blocked with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5% skimmed milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies: anti α-tubulin (DM1A), anti-myosin heavy chain (My32) (Sigma), anti-HA epitope (12CA5) (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG epitope (Sigma), anti-S6K1 (C-18) and anti-CdK4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (Chemicon), anti-4-EPB1 and anti-Phospho-S6 (Ser-265/236) (Cell Signaling), and anti-eIF3-f (Rockland). The anti-MAFbx antibodies have been described previously (17Tintignac L.A. Lagirand J. Batonnet S. Sirri V. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol.

Nitrocellulose membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The blots were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were exposed with Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) films. In Vitro and in Cellulo Ubiquitination Assay—In vitro ubiquitination assays were determined essentially as described (17Tintignac L.A. Lagirand J. Batonnet S. Sirri V. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2847-2856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C and were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. The products were subject to SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For the in cellulo ubiquitination assay, pCMV-FLAG-eIF3-f and pCDNA-HA-ubiquitin were cotransfected into C2C12 cells in the presence of expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged MAFbx wild type (WT) and/or GFP-MAFbx-ΔF-box. MG132 (30 μm) was added to the culture medium 2 h before harvesting the cells. Cell lysates were prepared in ubiquitination buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% NaDOC, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were revealed using anti-HA antibody. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were cultured on coverslips and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were treated with 5% normal goat serum and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) followed by immunostaining with monoclonal antibody anti-HA and the polyclonal anti-skeletal myosin. The Texas Red-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of donkey anti-mouse IgG was used to visualize the mouse monoclonal antibody, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to visualize the rabbit polyclonal antibody. Cells were rinsed in PBS containing Hoechst, mounted in Citifluor, and viewed and photographed as described above. Muscle Electrotransfer, Histological Analysis, and Fiber Size Measurement—In vivo transfection experiments were carried out as described previously (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Fasted (48 h) and control (fed) C57BL/6 mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were removed, embedded in Cryomatrix (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and quickly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Muscles were then sectioned in a microtome cryostat (Leica). Transversal sections (12 μm) were fixed with methanol for 5 min at -20 °C, rinsed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocking buffer for 1 h (3% bovine serum albumin, 20% normal goat serum in PBS). Rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, used at 1:100) and rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin antibody (Sigma) were then applied overnight to the treated sections. Bound primary antibodies were detected with cyanine 3-conjugated anti-rat IgG and goat anti-rabbit Texas Red IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), respectively. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. Fiber cross-sectional areas were measured using Perfect Image software and determined for four sections from our animals in each group. Statistics—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant differences test (SigmaSTAT software). A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-terminal Lysine Residues of eIF3-f Control MAFbx-directed Polyubiquitination of eIF3-f—During skeletal muscle atrophy, MAFbx targets the initiation factor eIF3-f for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To determine which region of eIF3-f is involved in the MAFbx-mediated polyubiquitination, we constructed a panel of eIF3-f deletion mutants. The expression constructs were transiently expressed in C2C12 cells, and the stability of eIF3-f protein was assessed after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132) 48 h later. The expressions of the NH2 domain and the Mov34 motif were not significantly modified after MG132 treatment and were stable with regard to eIF3-f WT. In contrast, the C-terminal domain of eIF3-f (amino acids 192–361) was accumulated, suggesting that it is involved in the destabilization of the protein (supplemental Fig. S1). Because the conserved eIF3-f protein contains six lysines in the C terminus, point mutations in which lysines are sequentially replaced by arginine (Lys → Arg) starting by lysine 218 (K5) to lysine 357 (K10) were used in in vitro and in cellulo experiments. The ability of these eIF3-f mutants to accumulate in the presence of MG132 was tested in cellulo. The addition of MG132 for 5 h demonstrated that all the eIF3-f mutants proteins retained sensibility to proteasome degradation (Fig. 1A). Independent mutation of the six lysines did not confer resistance to proteasome-mediated eIF3-f degradation. Although some lysines such as Lys-242, Lys-258, and Lys-357 seem to be more implicated in the polyubiquitination of eIF3-f, Fig. 1B illustrates that none of these residues is the preferential ubiquitination site. In contrast, the mutation of the six lysines in arginines (mutant K5–10R) abolished the sensibility to MG132 (Fig. 1A). Altogether, these data suggest that all six lysine residues are involved in the proteasome-mediated degradation of eIF3-f. In addition, in an in vitro ubiquitination assay, SCFMAFbx purified from recombinant baculoviruses produced in Sf9 cells (17Tintignac L.A. Lagirand J. Batonnet S. Sirri V. Leibovitch M.-P. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2847-2856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) catalyzed the polyubiquitination of each of the different eIF3-f mutants (Fig. 1C). As starvation increases the expression of MAFbx, leading to rapid myotube atrophy (5Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K. Nunez L. Clarke B.A. Poueymirou W.T. Panaro F.J. Na E. Dharmarajan K.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the effects of atrophic lysates were tested on eIF3-f ubiquitination. The polyubiquitination of each of the six eIF3-f mutants was dramatically increased after incubation in extracts from atrophic myotubes when compared with extracts of normal C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 1D). Because of the functionality of the six lysines, mutant (K5–10R) was examined for MAFbx-mediated polyubiquitination of eIF3-f. The eIF3-f mutant K5–10R showed a dramatically reduced polyubiquitination by the SCFMAFbx purified complex (Fig. 1C) and was no longer polyubiquitinated when incubated with extracts from atrophic myotubes (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, MAFbx-mediated polyubiquitination of eIF3-f mutant K5–10R was tested in cellulo. Expression vectors encoding either MAFbx WT or the mutant MAFbx ΔF-box (deletion of the F-box domain required for Skp1 interaction) were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged eIF3-f WT or mutant eIF3-f K5–10R and HA-ubiquitin, into C2C12 cells. eIF3-f was first immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and then probed with anti-HA to detect ubiquitinated eIF3-f proteins. eIF3-f WT showed increasing amounts of polyubiquitination only in the presence of MAFbx WT but not in the presence of MAFbx ΔF-box mutant (7Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.-P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), whereas MAFbx WT and/or the ΔF-box mutant did not promote the ubiquitination of the eIF3-f mutant K5–10R (Fig. 2A). To exclude the possibility that the observed resistance of mutant K5–10R to MAFbx-mediated polyubiquitination resulted from a failure to bind MAFbx, this interaction was analyzed in cellulo. In transfected C2C12 cells, HA-MAFbx coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-eIF3-f WT and/or FLAG-eIF3-f mutant K5–10R (supplemental Fig. S2). Finally, to assess the consequence of the C-terminal lysine polyubiquitination on eIF3-f stability, we compared the half-life of transiently expressed FLAG-eIF3-f WT and mutant K5–10R in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, substitution mutagenesis of the C terminus lysines was sufficient to markedly stabilize eIF3-f (half-life >240 min). To test whether MAFbx could influence the turnover of the mutant eIF3-f K5–10R in cellulo, we cotransfected HA-MAFbx with FLAG-eIF3-f WT or the mutant K5–10R into C2C12 cells and then monitored eIF3-f protein stability after CHX treatment. As expected, overexpression of MAFbx did not affect eIF3-f K5–10R stability (half-life was >240 min) but enhanced destabilization of eIF3-f WT by decreasing its half-life to ∼80 min (Fig. 2C). A sequence comparison revealed that all six lysines and the surrounding residues are well conserved in eIF3-f homologs from chicken to human (supplemental Fig. S3). Our results suggest that the MAFbx-mediated polyubiquitination of eIF3-f and degradation by the proteasome require each of six lysine residues (K5 to K10) located in the C-terminal domain. Thus, mutation of C-terminal lysine residues prevents the polyubiquitination and stabilizes eIF3-f. The eIF3-f Mutant K5–10R Delays Starvation-induced Atrophy in Primary Mouse Skeletal Muscle Myotubes—Among the myofibrillar proteins, the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) is a preferred target of multiple pro-cachectic factors inducing muscle wasting in cellulo and in vivo (19Acharyya S. Ladner K.J. Nelsen L.L. Damrauer J. Reiser P.J. Swoap S. Guttridge D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). This prompted us to test whether the eIF3-f mutant K5–10R was able to prevent the loss of MyHC in muscle cells. Primary myoblasts from satellite cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged eIF3-f WT and/or the mutant eIF3-f K5–10R under the control of the MCK promoter. After 72 h in differentiation medium, myotubes were starved for 6 h in PBS. Western blot analysis revealed an increase in MAFbx expression in atrophy, and expression of the eIF3-f mutant K5–10R not only increased the levels of the MyHC in control conditions but efficiently prevented MyHC loss in myotubes undergoing atrophy (Fig. 3A). In addition, overexpression of the mutant K5–10R efficiently prevented the starvation-induced atrophy by blocking the decrease of mean myotube diameter in satellite cells (Fig. 3, B and C). As expected, in control cells, overexpression of eIF3-f WT showed an increase in myotube diameter when compared with empty vector. Interestingly, eIF3-f K5–10R showed a higher enhanced hypertrophic effect than eIF3-f WT as observed by the increased myotubes diameter (Fig. 3, B and C). Muscle hypertrophy is associated with increased protein synthesis (20Goldspink D.F. Garlick P.J. McNurlan M.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (21Bodine S.C. Stitt T.N. Gonzalez M. Kline W.O. Stover G.L. Bauerlein R. Zlotchenko E. Scrimgeour A. Lawrence J.C. Glass D.J.

This unique light-driven reaction plays a key role in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus, but despite its biological importance, the mechanism of light-activated catalysis is unknown. In this study, we show that Pchlide reduction occurs by dynamically coupled nuclear quantum tunneling of a hydride anion followed by a proton on the microsecond time scale in the Pchlide excited and ground states, respectively. We demonstrate the need for fast dynamic searches to form degenerate “tunneling-ready” configurations within the lifetime of the Pchlide excited state from which hydride transfer occurs. Moreover, we have found a breakpoint at -27 °C in the temperature dependence of the hydride transfer rate, which suggests that motions/vibrations that are important for promoting light-activated hydride tunneling are quenched below -27 °C. We observed no such breakpoint for the proton-tunneling reaction, indicating a reliance on different promoting modes for this reaction in the enzyme-substrate complex. Our studies indicate that the overall photoreduction of Pchlide is endothermic and that rapid dynamic searches are required to form distinct tunneling-ready configurations within the lifetime of the photoexcited state.

Consequently, we have established the first important link between photochemical and nuclear quantum tunneling reactions, linked to protein dynamics, in a biologically significant system. Hydrogen transfer reactions are fundamental chemical processes that are essential for almost all biological reactions. H-transfer by tunneling is an important feature of these reactions in enzymes (1Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature.. 1999; 399: 496-499Google Scholar, 2Garcia-Viloca M. Gao J.

Science.. 2006; 313: 1638-1642Google Scholar). A major limitation has been the inability to synchronously trigger catalysis on ultrafast time scales for the majority of enzymes that require mixing strategies to initiate the reaction. However, by using the light-activated enzyme, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR 4The abbreviations used are: POR, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; Chlide, chlorophyllide; KIE, kinetic isotope effect; SIE, solvent isotope effect; DFT, density functional theory. ; EC 1.3.1.33) (7Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 2005; 30: 642-649Google Scholar), we have triggered two enzymatic H-transfer reactions using a single pulse of light, and we show these reactions occur sequentially by quantum tunneling in a pre-formed enzyme-substrate complex. This has provided a unique opportunity to analyze these reactions at physiological and cryogenic temperatures, on very fast time scales, that are experimentally inaccessible with other enzyme systems. POR catalyzes the trans addition of hydrogen across the C-17–C-18 double bond of the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to produce chlorophyllide (Chlide) (7Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci.. 2005; 30: 642-649Google Scholar), a unique light-driven reaction in the synthesis of the most abundant pigment on earth, which plays a key role in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (8Lebedev N.

In addition to POR, nonflowering land plants, algae, and cyanobacteria possess a light-independent Pchlide reductase, which consists of three separate subunits and allows these organisms to produce Chlide in the dark (10Bröcker M.J.

However, despite its biological significance, the detailed mechanism of this light-activated catalysis remains poorly understood. Low temperature spectroscopy has identified a number of steps in the reaction cycle, including an initial light-driven reaction (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the reaction, reduction of Pchlide by NADPH in the POR-NADPH-Pchlide complex involves hydride transfer from the pro-S face of NADPH to the C-17 atom of Pchlide (16Begley T.P. Young H. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1989; 111: 3095-3096Google Scholar). The valence of the C-18 atom is satisfied by the transfer of a proton from a conserved Tyr residue (Fig. 1), a finding based on previous site-directed mutagenesis studies (17Wilks H.M. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 724-728Google Scholar) and the structural homology model of the Synechocystis enzyme (18Townley H.E. Sessions R.B. Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Griffiths W.T. Proteins.. 2001; 44: 329-335Google Scholar). The remaining dark reactions involve a series of ordered product release and cofactor binding steps, which are linked to conformational changes in the enzyme (13Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Hunter C.N.

In addition, previous ultrafast measurements on POR have revealed that spectral changes on the picosecond time scale are likely to represent conformational changes that occur before the reduction of Pchlide (19Heyes D.J.

Hunter C.N. Alexandre M.T. van Stokkum I.H.M. van Grondelle R. Groot M.L. Nature.. 2008; 456: 1001-1004Google Scholar). However, a detailed description of the light-driven chemical steps is currently lacking. To access this chemistry we have now synchronized the turnover of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide complex (assembled in the dark) by using a 6-ns laser pulse tuned to the Soret region of the Pchlide absorbance spectrum for analysis in the nanosecond to microsecond time domain. We have combined kinetic analysis with studies of both the temperature and isotopic dependence of the rate of hydride and proton transfer to derive information on the mechanism of H-transfer in the photoexcited state of the ternary enzyme-substrate complex. Sample Preparation—Recombinant POR from Thermosynechococcus elongatus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (14Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Google Scholar). Pchlide was purified as described (14Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Google Scholar). Deuterated pro-S NADPH (NADP2H) was purified and analyzed for chemical and isotopic purity as described (23Pudney C.R. Hay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2006; 128: 14053-14058Google Scholar). Solvent isotope effects were measured using deuterated buffer systems made with D2O, d8-glycerol (both Goss Scientific), and deuterated sucrose, which was produced by exchange into D2O. For solvent isotope effect measurements, POR was deuterated by exchange into a deuterated buffer system containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Laser Photoexcitation Measurements—Photoexcitation of POR ternary complexes (POR-NADPH-Pchlide) was by excitation at 450 nm, using an optical parametric oscillator of a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (Brilliant B, Quantel) in a cuvette of 1-cm path length as described (15Heyes D.J. Sakuma M. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 32015-32020Google Scholar). Laser pulses (∼60 mJ) were between 6 and 8 ns in duration. Absorption transients were recorded at 696 and 681 nm using an LKS-60 flash photolysis instrument (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) with the detection system (comprising probe light, first monochromator, sample, second monochromator, and photomultiplier) at right angles to the incident laser beam. Rate constants were observed from the average of at least five time-dependent absorption measurements by fitting to a single exponential function. For studies of the temperature dependence of rate constants, reaction components were assembled in the dark in a volume of 1 ml and contained 100 μm POR (or deuterated enzyme), 250 μm NADPH (or NADP2H), and 30 μm Pchlide in 44% glycerol and 20% sucrose containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Genapol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Control experiments in the absence of any cryoprotectant confirmed that the respective kinetic and solvent isotope effects were not influenced by the presence of glycerol or sucrose. Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations—Calculations followed previous procedures (24de Visser S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2006; 128: 9813-9824Google Scholar) and used the hybrid density functional method B3LYP (25Becke A.D. J. Chem. Phys.. 1993; 98: 5648-5652Google Scholar) in combination with a 6-311+G* basis set on all atoms (26Hehre W.J. Ditchfield R. Pople J. J. Chem. Phys.. 1972; 56: 2257-2261Google Scholar). Full geometry optimizations were performed in Jaguar 7.0 with a dielectric constant of ϵ = 5.7 included using the self-consistent reaction field model (27Schrödinger LLC Jaguar 7.0. Schrödinger LLC, Portland, OR2007Google Scholar). The theoretical model for the reduction of the C-17–C-18 bond of Pchlide contains the pigment without side chains, except for the propionate chain that is attached to C-17, which is replaced by an ethyl group to keep the overall charge of the model neutral. In addition, the nicotinamide ring of NADPH and phenol (for the Tyr-193 side chain) was added to the model, and they function as hydride and proton donors, respectively. To prevent the NADPH and phenol groups from undergoing excessive changes during the geometry optimizations, a constraint was placed on one of the atoms of each group with respect to the magnesium atom of the Pchlide. This did not cause any problems during the geometry optimization. The total model had stoichiometry of MgC36N6H30O3 and overall charge of 0. All calculations followed established procedures in the field (24de Visser S.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2006; 128: 9813-9824Google Scholar) and use the hybrid density functional method B3LYP (25Becke A.D. J. Chem. Phys.. 1993; 98: 5648-5652Google Scholar), as implemented in Jaguar 7.0 (27Schrödinger LLC Jaguar 7.0. Schrödinger LLC, Portland, OR2007Google Scholar) in combination with 6-311+G* basis set on all atoms (26Hehre W.J. Ditchfield R. Pople J. J. Chem. Phys.. 1972; 56: 2257-2261Google Scholar). Structures were fully optimized in Jaguar, followed by an analytical frequency calculation. Obtained gas-phase results predicted a stepwise reaction process via a radical intermediate between two consecutive hydrogen abstraction reactions, which is in disagreement with the experiment. We subsequently added a dielectric constant of ϵ = 5.7 in combination with a probe radius of 2.72 Å, as is commonly used for theoretical studies of enzyme mechanism and has been shown to be a good representative of environmental perturbations generated by an enzyme (28Shaik S. Kumar D. de Visser S.P. Altun A. Thiel W. Chem. Rev.. 2005; 105: 2279-2328Google Scholar, 29de Visser S.P. Oh K. Han A.-R. Nam W. Inorg. Chem.. 2007; 46: 4632-4641Google Scholar). Calculations, with a dielectric constant incorporated, predicted the charge distributions of intermediates and products that are consistent with sequential hydride and proton transfer. Therefore, only results in which a dielectric constant was included were used for the final calculations. Despite the large electronic differences between the gas-phase and solvent-based calculations, the differences in optimized geometries were actually quite small. The solvent optimized structures have little radical character, and hence the group spin densities are close to zero. Sequential Kinetic Mechanism for Hydride and Proton Transfer—Photoexcitation of the POR-NADPH-Pchlide complex generates an intermediate at 696 nm (Fig. 2A) with a rate constant of 2.02 ± 0.21 × 106 s-1 at 25 °C. Similar traces obtained between 665 and 720 nm define the “action spectrum” for this step (Fig. 2A, inset) and reveal that this species is identical to the intermediate observed in earlier studies (11Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Google Scholar), thus providing the first direct kinetic link to previous cryogenic measurements. In addition, this step has a primary kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of ∼2, when measurements are repeated with pro-S NADP2H, which confirms that the hydride transfer reaction from coenzyme to Pchlide (Fig. 1, reaction A) is significantly faster than any other reported hydride transfer reaction in biology. At longer times following laser initiation of catalysis, the 696 nm trace decays over ∼100 μs (rate constant = 25.3 ± 1.5 × 103 s-1 at 25 °C; Fig. 2B) and is accompanied by an absorbance increase at 681 nm with a similar rate constant (Fig. 2C). Action spectra, generated from a series of kinetic traces (wavelength range 660–720 nm), confirm that the new intermediate has an absorbance peak centered at ∼680 nm (Fig. 2B, inset), which has previously been shown to represent the POR-NADP+-Chlide product complex (13Heyes D.J. Ruban A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 523-528Google Scholar, 14Heyes D.J. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry.. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Google Scholar). A solvent isotope effect (SIE) of ∼2.2 at 25 °C was measured for this step, implying that it represents the proton transfer reaction (Fig. 1, reaction B). Importantly, the SIE associated with reaction A is close to unity, which suggests that the SIE on the second step is a specific probe of proton transfer to substrate. Also, the lack of a KIE in reaction B indicates that hydride transfer only occurs during reaction A (Table 1) and provides conclusive proof of a sequential hydride transfer followed by proton transfer mechanism.TABLE 1The rates of the hydride transfer and proton transfer steps in the presence of either pro-S NADPH or S-NADP2H and in either H2O or 2H2O buffers All rates were measured at 25 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”SampleHydride transferProton transferRateKIERateSIEs–1 × 106s–1 × 103NADPH in H2O2.02 ± 0.21125.3 ± 1.51NADP2H in H2O1.00 ± 0.142.03 ± 0.3525.6 ± 3.10.99 ± 0.14NADPH in 2H2O1.79 ± 0.221.13 ± 0.1811.5 ± 1.12.20 ± 0.24NADP2H in 2H2O0.89 ± 0.122.25 ± 0.3810.6 ± 0.42.39 ± 0.17 Open table in a new tab Both H-transfer Reactions Proceed via Quantum Mechanical Tunneling—We extended our analysis of hydride and proton transfer to cover a wide temperature range (-80 °C to +50 °C), and in particular to cryogenic temperatures, a regime that is difficult for thermally activated enzyme systems that require mixing methods for reaction initiation. Data were analyzed in the form of Eyring plots (Fig. 3), which provides thermodynamic parameters for each step (Tables 2 and 3) and reveals that both H-transfer reactions proceed by quantum mechanical tunneling. The proton transfer rate is strongly dependent on temperature (ΔH‡ = 74.8 kJ mol-1), and the SIE is temperature-dependent with an inverse extrapolated Eyring prefactor ratio (A′H/A′D = 0.041) (Fig. 3A and Table 2). This is consistent with a proton-tunneling reaction, which requires fast (sub-picosecond) promoting motions coupled to the reaction coordinate (30Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2002; 269: 3113-3121Google Scholar, 31Masgrau L. Basran J. Hothi P. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2004; 428: 41-51Google Scholar) within the model for environmentally coupled hydrogen tunneling (32Kuznetsov A.M. Ulstrup J. Can. J. Chem.. 1999; 77: 1085-1096Google Scholar, 33Knapp M.J. Ricert K. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2002; 124: 3865-3874Google Scholar). This involves motion to achieve the reactant and product well degeneracy required for tunneling, and gated motion along the H-transfer coordinate (indicated by the temperature dependence of the KIE) to enhance nuclear wave function overlap for the transferring proton (30Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2002; 269: 3113-3121Google Scholar, 31Masgrau L. Basran J. Hothi P. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2004; 428: 41-51Google Scholar). The lack of a breakpoint in the Eyring plot suggests that the gated motion is coupled to the proton tunneling coordinate at all temperatures studied (-80 °C to +50 °C).TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for the proton transfer step in the POR-catalyzed reaction The enthalpies of activation, ΔH‡, and the entropies of activation, ΔS‡, have been calculated by fitting the temperature dependence data to the Eyring equation for each step.H2OD2OΔH‡ (kJ mol–1)74.8 ± 0.884.6 ± 0.3ΔΔH‡ (kJ mol–1)9.8 ± 0.8ΔS‡ (J mol–1 K–1)65.7 ± 0.892.2 ± 0.4lnA′31.7 ± 0.434.9 ± 0.1A′H/A′D0.041 ± 0.016 Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Thermodynamic parameters for the hydride transfer step in the POR-catalyzed reaction The enthalpies of activation, ΔH‡, and the entropies of activation, ΔS‡, have been calculated by fitting the temperature dependence data to the Eyring equation for each step.Above –27 °CBelow –27 °CNADPHNADPDNADPHNADPDΔH‡ (kJ mol–1)9.3 ± 0.417.5 ± 0.527.2 ± 0.527.7 ± 0.9ΔΔH‡ (kJ mol–1)8.2 ± 0.60.4 ± 1.0ΔS‡ (J mol–1 K–1)–94.4 ± 1.2–73.2 ± 1.1–21.8 ± 0.3–32.4 ± 0.8lnA′12.4 ± 0.215.0 ± 0.221.1 ± 0.319.9 ± 0.5A′H/A′D0.08 ± 0.023.6 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab By contrast, the faster light-activated hydride transfer step shows a clear breakpoint at -27 °C in the Eyring plot with both protiated and deuterated NADPH (Fig. 3B). Above -27 °C the reaction has a relatively weak temperature dependence (ΔH‡ = 9.3 kJ mol-1 for NADPH) but becomes considerably more temperature-dependent below the breakpoint (ΔH‡ = 27.2 kJ mol-1) (Table 3). At temperatures below the breakpoint, the KIE is measurably independent of temperature, and the prefactor ratio (A′H/A′D = 3.59) is similar in value to the observed KIE, indicating quantum tunneling of hydride in the absence of an experimentally detectable (i.e. dominant) gating motion, coupled to the hydride transfer coordinate (3Masgrau L. Roujeinikova A. Johannissen L.O. Hothi P. Basran J. Ranaghan K.E. Mulholland A.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Leys D. Science.. 2006; 312: 237-241Google Scholar, 34Johannissen L.O. Hay S. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. J. Phys. Chem. B.. 2007; 111: 2631-2638Google Scholar). This contrasts with the situation at temperatures above -27 °C, where the KIE is dependent on temperature and the prefactor ratio is less than unity (A′H/A′D = 0.077), consistent with the need for a more dominant gating motion along the hydride transfer coordinate (30Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2002; 269: 3113-3121Google Scholar). DFT Calculations Confirm the Catalytic Mechanism—To gain further insights into the reaction mechanism, we set up a theoretical model representing the important features of the system (Fig. 4; supplemental Fig. S1). We have assumed a starting reactant complex (R) that involves Pchlide forming a long range complex with NADPH and the phenol group of the Tyr proton donor. Full geometry optimizations were performed in a dielectric constant of magnitude ϵ = 5.7, which has been shown to correctly predict the values of an enzyme-mimicked environment (35Blomberg L.M. Blomberg M.R.A. Siegbahn P.E.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem.. 2004; 9: 923-935Google Scholar, 36de Visser S.P. Inorg. Chem.. 2006; 45: 9551-9557Google Scholar). The overall reaction mechanism is endothermic (63.9 kJ mol-1) and involves hydride transfer from NADPH to the C-17 atom of Pchlide to give an intermediate (I) via transition state TS1, followed by the subsequent proton transfer reaction to form the product complex (P) via barrier TS2. A time-dependent density functional theory calculation (37Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Montgomery Jr., J.A. Vreven T. Kudin K.N. Burant J.C.

Gonzalez C. Pople J.A. Gaussian-03. Revision C.01, Gaussian, Inc, Wallingford, CT2004Google Scholar) on the reactant geometry shows that a close manifold of electronic states is accessible with the lowest Franck-Condon transition located at 210 kJ mol-1 (2.18 eV). The system then has sufficient energy to cross the hydride transfer barrier via quantum mechanical tunneling and relax back to the ground state potential energy surface to form the intermediate complex. The subsequent barrier (ΔG‡ = 67.7 kJ mol-1 at 298 K) of the proton transfer step, leading to product formation, is of much lower energy on the ground state potential energy surface and is in excellent agreement with the experimental data shown above in Fig. 3. Charge distributions (Fig. 4) confirm that the I is formed by hydride transfer, generating a positively charged NADP+ group (QNADPH = 1.16) and a double negatively charged Pchlide (QPchlide =-2.09), consistent with a change in hybridization (sp2 to sp3) for the C-17 atom of Pchlide. The theoretical reaction energetics agree closely with those observed from our temperature dependence studies of the hydride and proton transfer kinetics (Table 2 and Table 3) and confirm that the light-activated sequential transfer of hydride (excited state) and proton (ground state) is an appropriate chemical mechanism for the POR-catalyzed reduction of Pchlide. Our theoretical model demonstrates the need for light activation to drive an overall endothermic reaction from the Pchlide excited state. A consequence is that a dynamic search for “tunneling-ready” configurations (i.e. reactant configurations in which donor and acceptor wells become degenerate (23Pudney C.R. Hay S. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2006; 128: 14053-14058Google Scholar)) must occur within the lifetime of the photoexcited state. Significantly, there is a loss of amplitude for the hydride and proton transfer signals at lower temperatures (Fig. 3C), which suggests that dynamic searches for the tunneling-ready configuration are impeded as the temperature is reduced and that relaxation from the excited state becomes dominant. This model is supported by the presence of the -27 °C breakpoint for the hydride transfer reaction. Below the breakpoint, the lack of a measurable temperature dependence on the KIE implies that quenching of gated motion along the hydride transfer coordinate will impede hydride tunneling as the wavefunction overlap becomes less optimal (30Knapp M.J. Klinman J.P. Eur. J. Biochem.. 2002; 269: 3113-3121Google Scholar, 31Masgrau L. Basran J. Hothi P. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 2004; 428: 41-51Google Scholar). In addition, the observed increase in the temperature dependence of the hydride transfer rate below the transition point reflects the increased energetic cost of tunneling in the absence of an “assisting” motion coupled to the hydride transfer coordinate. By necessity, this implies that the system rarely reaches a tunneling-ready conformation, but when it does, it is at an ideal donor-acceptor distance. Conclusions—In conclusion, we have established a direct link between light-activated chemistry and nuclear tunneling in a biologically important enzyme system. Furthermore, by extending our studies of light activation to cryogenic regimes, we have shown that gated motion along the H-transfer coordinate enhances the tunneling reaction. In contrast to the slower dynamic searches that generally limit H-transfer rates in thermally activated enzyme systems (1Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature.. 1999; 399: 496-499Google Scholar, 38Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Google Scholar, 39Hammes-Schiffer S. Benkovic S.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2006; 75: 519-541Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that fast dynamic searches within the lifetime of the excited state are required to reach a tunneling-ready configuration. Viewed globally, light-driven nuclear tunneling enables photosynthetic organisms to make chlorophyll despite the large and opposing thermodynamic gradient for this crucial reaction.

We compared mortality and HIV-free of breast and formula-fed infants born to HIV-positive mothers in a program in rural, Rakai District Uganda. Methodology/Principal Findings One hundred eighty two infants born to HIV-positive mothers were followed at one, six and twelve months postpartum. Mothers were given infant-feeding counseling and allowed to make informed choices as to whether to formula-feed or breast-feed. Eligible mothers and infants received antiretroviral therapy (ART) if indicated. Mothers and their newborns received prophylaxis for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (pMTCT) if they were not receiving ART. Infant HIV infection was detected by PCR (Roche Amplicor 1.5) during the follow-up visits. Kaplan Meier time-to-event methods were used to compare mortality and HIV-free survival. The adjusted hazard ratio (Adjusted HR) of infant HIV-free survival was estimated by Cox regression. Seventy-five infants (41%) were formula-fed while 107 (59%) were breast-fed. Exclusive breast-feeding was practiced by only 25% of breast-feeding women at one month postpartum. The cumulative 12-month probability of infant mortality was 18% (95% CI = 11%–29%) among the formula-fed compared to 3% (95% CI = 1%–9%) among the breast-fed infants (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 6.1(95% CI = 1.7–21.4, P-value<0.01). There were no statistically significant differentials in HIV-free survival by feeding choice (86% in the formula-fed compared to 96% in breast-fed group (Adjusted RH = 2.8[95%CI = 0.67–11.7, P-value = 0.16] Conclusions/Significance Formula-feeding was associated with a higher risk of infant mortality than breastfeeding in this rural population. Our findings suggest that formula-feeding should be discouraged in similar African settings."

A similar approach can be helpful to identify biologically relevant and clinically meaningful targets in M.tuberculosis (MTB) infection for diagnosis or TB vaccine development in clinically well defined populations. Method We constructed a high-content peptide microarray with 61 M.tuberculosis proteins as linear 15 aa peptide stretches with 12 aa overlaps resulting in 7446 individual peptide epitopes. Antibody profiling was carried with serum from 34 individuals with active pulmonary TB and 35 healthy individuals in order to obtain an unbiased view of the MTB epitope pattern recognition pattern. Quality data extraction was performed, data sets were analyzed for significant differences and patterns predictive of TB+/−. Findings Three distinct patterns of IgG reactivity were identified: 89/7446 peptides were differentially recognized (in 34/34 TB+ patients and in 35/35 healthy individuals) and are highly predictive of the division into TB+ and TB−, other targets were exclusively recognized in all patients with TB (e.g. sigmaF) but not in any of the healthy individuals, and a third peptide set was recognized exclusively in healthy individuals (35/35) but no in TB+ patients. The segregation between TB+ and TB− does not cluster into specific recognition of distinct MTB proteins, but into specific peptide epitope ‘hotspots’ at different locations within the same protein. Antigen recognition pattern profiles in serum from TB+ patients from Armenia vs. patients recruited in Sweden showed that IgG-defined MTB epitopes are very similar in individuals with different genetic background. Conclusions A uniform target MTB IgG-epitope recognition pattern exists in pulmonary tuberculosis. Unbiased, high-content peptide microarray chip-based testing of clinically well-defined populations allows to visualize biologically relevant targets useful for development of novel TB diagnostics and vaccines."

Low molecular weight compounds that interfere with ATP-binding such as geldanamycin or radicicol inhibit the Hsp90 function by competing for the interaction site. Many of the client proteins of Hsp90 are crucial elements of the cellular signal transduction pathway. Protein kinases represent the largest class of Hsp90 client proteins, and many have been shown to cause cancer when deregulated. These protein kinases depend on Hsp90 for their proper folding and functioning suggesting that Hsp90 itself is a valid anti-cancer target of pharmaceutical interest (8Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2005; 5: 761-772Google Scholar). Hsp90 does not directly bind to protein kinases, but this interaction is mediated by the co-chaperone Cdc37/p50. Hence, Cdc37 has also been dubbed as a kinase targeting subunit of the Hsp90 machinery (9Hunter T. Poon R.Y.C. Trends Cell Biol.. 1997; 7: 157-161Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cdc37 is also able to act as a chaperone by itself independent of Hsp90 (10MacLean M. Picard D. Cell Stress Chaperones.. 2003; 8: 114-119Google Scholar). The cell division cycle protein 37 (Cdc37) was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a protein required for the “Start” event in the cell division cycle (11Reed S.I. Genetics.. 1980; 95: 561-577Google Scholar). In yeast, cdc37 mutations cause synthetic lethality (as defined by Kaelin (56Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2005; 5: 689-698Google Scholar)) in combination with thermosensitive cdc28 or kin28 mutations (12Reed S.I. de Barros Lopes M.A. Ferguson J. Hadwiger J.A. Ho J.Y. Horwitz R. Jones C.A. Lorincz A.T. Mendenhall M.D. Peterson T.A. Richardson S.L. Wittenberg C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol.. 1985; 50: 627-634Google Scholar, 13Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol.. 1995; 249: 535-544Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of Cdc37, also referred to as p50cdc37, was first identified within a complex consisting of the Rous sarcoma virus encoded oncogene pp60v-scr and Hsp90 (14Whitelaw M.L. Hutchison K. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem.. 1991; 266: 16436-16440Google Scholar, 15Brugge J.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol.. 1986; 123: 1-22Google Scholar). Further studies confirmed that protein kinases are the most favored targets of Cdc37 (16Mort-Bontemps-Soret M. Facca C. Faye G. Mol. Genet. Genomics.. 2002; 267: 447-458Google Scholar). A plethora of other oncogenic kinases, including Raf isoforms, Akt, and ErbB2, have been identified as potential clients of Cdc37 (17Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 39858-39866Google Scholar, 18Lamphere L. Fiore F. Xu X. Brizuela L. Keezer S. Sardet C. Draetta G.F. Gyuris J. Oncogene.. 1997; 14: 1999-2004Google Scholar, 19Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Google Scholar, 20Pearl L.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev.. 2005; 15: 55-61Google Scholar). Expression of Cdc37 is up-regulated in cancer cells and tissues and can promote tumorigenesis when overexpressed (21Schwarze S.R. Fu V.X. Jarrard D.F. Cancer Res.. 2003; 63: 4614-4619Google Scholar, 22Stepanova L. Yang G. DeMayo F. Wheeler T.M. Finegold M. Thompson T.C. Harper J.W. Oncogene.. 2000; 19: 2186-2193Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc37 can inhibit the ATPase activity of Hsp90 implied in promoting the assembly of kinase clients with both chaperone proteins (23Matts R.L. Caplan A.J. Calderwood S.K. Sherman M.Y. Ciocca D.R. Heat Shock Proteins in Cancer. 1st Ed. Springer Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2007: 331-350Google Scholar, 24Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyerc P. Singh S. Woolfson D.N. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 20151-20159Google Scholar). Structurally, the 44.5-kDa protein Cdc37 can be dissected into three domains (10MacLean M. Picard D. Cell Stress Chaperones.. 2003; 8: 114-119Google Scholar, 25Shao J. Irwin A. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 12577-12588Google Scholar). Proteolytic fingerprinting studies indicate that it is comprised of an N-terminal domain (residues 1-127 (Cdc37N), 15.5 kDa), a middle domain (residues 147-276 (Cdc37M), 16 kDa), and a C-terminal domain (residues 283-378 (Cdc37C), 10.5 kDa). The middle domain Cdc37M is highly resistant to proteolytic digestion and was found to be the most stable domain of Cdc37 (26Zhang W. Hirshberg M. McLaughlin S.H. Lazar G.A. Grossmann J.G. Nielsen P.R. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. Laue E.D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 340: 891-907Google Scholar). Several studies (19Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Google Scholar, 27Lee P. Rao J. Fliss A. Yang E. Garrett S. Caplan A.J. J. Cell Biol.. 2002; 159: 1051-1059Google Scholar, 28Scholz G. Hartson S.D. Cartledge K.

Chem.. 2003; 278: 38117-38120Google Scholar) have shown that Cdc37N binds to the client proteins (e.g. kinases). A highly conserved region within Cdc37N contains Ser-13 as a unique phosphorylation site for the protein kinase CKII. Phosphorylation seems to be an important mechanism for controlling the binding affinity to the client protein kinases and as a consequence thereof regulating the activity of multiple protein kinases (31Miyata Y. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 4065-4074Google Scholar). The Hsp90 binding site is located in the middle domain of Cdc37, which also comprises a putative dimerization region (32Roe S.M. Ali M.M.U. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell.. 2004; 116: 87-98Google Scholar). An extended α-helix connects the Hsp90 binding site to the C-terminal domain, which might also be required for dimer formation (24Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyerc P. Singh S. Woolfson D.N. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 20151-20159Google Scholar, 32Roe S.M. Ali M.M.U. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell.. 2004; 116: 87-98Google Scholar). The structure of the N-terminal domain is yet unknown but sequence analysis predicts a high content of α-helices (32Roe S.M. Ali M.M.U. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell.. 2004; 116: 87-98Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Cdc37MC (middle and C-terminal domain) bound to Hsp90N (from yeast) is a heterotetrameric complex, comprising Hsp90 bound to a Cdc37 dimer (32Roe S.M. Ali M.M.U. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell.. 2004; 116: 87-98Google Scholar). The function of Cdc37 to inhibit the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (24Siligardi G. Panaretou B. Meyerc P. Singh S. Woolfson D.N. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 20151-20159Google Scholar) is due to the extended side chain of Arg-167 that binds to Glu-33 of Hsp90, thereby inhibiting the ATPase reaction. Additional studies indicate that Cdc37M exists as a monomer (26Zhang W. Hirshberg M. McLaughlin S.H. Lazar G.A. Grossmann J.G. Nielsen P.R. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. Laue E.D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 340: 891-907Google Scholar). Low resolution cryoelectron microscopy images of the Hsp90·Cdc37·Cdk4 complex show that Cdc37 is a monomer in this interaction (33Vaughan C.K. Gohlke U. Sobott F. Good V.M. Ali M.M.U. Prodromou C. Robinson C.V. Saibil H.R. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 23: 697-707Google Scholar). However, these studies utilized yeast Hsp90, and it was realized that it is necessary to investigate the interaction with human Hsp90 (26Zhang W. Hirshberg M. McLaughlin S.H. Lazar G.A. Grossmann J.G. Nielsen P.R. Sobott F. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. Laue E.D. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 340: 891-907Google Scholar) to resolve the differences. Here, we report the structure determination of the human Hsp90N·Cdc37M complex based on the NMR backbone assignments of Cdc37M (34Sreeramulu S. Kumar J. Richter C. Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Langer T. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2005; 32: 262Google Scholar) and Hsp90N (35Jacobs D.M. Langer T. Elshorst B. Saxena K. Fiebig K.M. Vogtherr M. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2006; 36: 52Google Scholar). The interface of the complex between human Cdc37M and Hsp90N could be mapped based on NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) studies, and cross-saturation transfer (CST) techniques. Subsequently, we solved the x-ray crystal structure of human Cdc37M at 1.88 Å in its monomeric form. The structure of the Cdc37M·Hsp90N complex was generated by incorporating NMR data (CSPs and CSTs as ambiguous distance restraints and RDCs as orientational restraints) in the HADDOCK (36Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Google Scholar) docking protocol. Cdc37 Cloning, Expression, and Purification—From the cDNA (Invitrogen) the base pairs corresponding to amino acids 1-126, 147-276, 1-283, and 1-378 of human Cdc37 were amplified by PCR using 5′-ACACAACCATGGTGGACTACAGCGTGTGGGACCAC-3′,5′-ACACAAGGATCCTTCACTTGCTGAAGCCGTCTTTGCTGAGC-3′,5′-AAACCATGGGGAAACACAAGACCTTCGTGGAAAAATACG-3′,5′-AAGCAAGGATCCTTCACTTCATGGCCTTCTCGATGCGCAG-3′,5′-ACACAAGGATCCTTCAGCGCTCCTCCTCCTCGTACTCCTTC-3′,5′-TCTTTATTTTCAGGGCGCCATGGTGGACTACAGCGT-3′, and 5′-GCAGCCGGATCCTTCACACACTGACATCC-3′ as primers, respectively. The PCR product was double digested with NcoI and BamHI and cloned into the derivatized pKM263 (6xHis tag ProtGB1-Tev between Nde1 and Xho1) vector, which harbors ProtGB1 to enhance the solubility of the expressed fusion partner. The authenticity of the clone construct was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) containing the desired plasmid was grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth medium at 37 °C supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 reached 0.6-0.7. The culture was incubated in 5-liter Erlenmeyer flask for 5-6 h with aeration (160 rpm) at 37 °C before the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm of β-mercaptoethanol) with addition of 2 mg/ml lysozyme and 100 units/ml benzonase (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) protein suspension. After sonication (10×, 60-s pulse on, and 180-s pulse off) in an ice bath, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 45 min, 4 °C) to yield a supernatant containing the soluble protein. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid FastFlow column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After Tev-protease cleavage to remove the His tag ProtGB1, the protein was applied again on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The pooled protein fractions were further purified by gel filtration on a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 75 preparative grade column (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) in Hepes 50 mm (pH 7.5), NaCl 100 mm, and 1 mm DTT. The protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and either immediately used for the experiments or stored at -20 °C. The 15N-labeled protein was produced by using M9 minimal media with 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source. Uniformly triple (2H,13C, and 15N) or double (2H and 15N) labeled protein was produced using Silantes OD2 media. The degree of isotopic enrichment for the Silantes media was >98% for all isotopes (manufacturer's data). For selective labeling with 15N-labeled amino acids, the following 15N-labeled amino acids were used: alanine, arginine, lysine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Spectra Stable Isotopes, Germany). The procedure applied for selective amino acid labeling is essentially the same as described in the literature (37Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol.. 1989; 177: 44-73Google Scholar). Hsp90N Cloning, Expression, and Purification—From the cDNA (Stratagene) the base pairs corresponding to amino acids 18-223 (N-terminal domain) of human Hsp90 were amplified by PCR using 5′-AAACCATGGGGGAGACGTTCGCCTTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCGGATCCTCACTCCACAAAAAGAG-3′ as primers. The PCR product was double digested with NcoI and BamHI and was cloned into the derivatized pKM263, with a Protein G B1 domain (ProtGB1) fusion protein located C-terminally behind a stretch of six histidines and a tev cleavage site under the control of a T7-promoter (see above). The protein was expressed and purified in the same way as Cdc37, except for the post induction temperature, which was 25 °C. In addition, tetra-selective labeling with 15N-glycine, 15N-alanine, 15N-phenylalanine, and 15N-leucine was carried out as described above. Due to the design of the expression vectors, Cdc37 and Hsp90N constructs carry two (GA) or four (GAMG) additional amino acids at the N terminus. High expression levels were achieved after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for Cdc37 and 25 °C for Hsp90N and ∼95% of the fused protein was found in the soluble fraction. Typically, 30 mg/liter of pure (95%) proteins was obtained after cleavage of protein G. The final samples were dialyzed against the NMR buffer (Hepes 50 mm (pH 7.5), NaCl 100 mm, and 1 mm DTT). Mutagenesis—Mutants of Cdc37M were created with Quik-Change kit (Stratagene), and sequenced to confirm the incorporation of the correct mutation. The mutant proteins were purified following the same protocol as the wild-type Cdc37M. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed at 298 K, on Bruker 600-, 700-, 800-, 900-, and 950-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryogenic triple-resonance probes. For the Cdc37M·Hsp90N complex a ratio of 1:1 was used for all measurements. The spectrometer was locked on D2O. The spectra were processed using Topspin 2.0 (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed using either SPARKY 3.113 4T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco. or CARA 1.8.3 (39Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial, CANTINA. Verlag, Goldau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). The resonances for the free form of Cdc37M at pH 5.5 and Hsp90N at pH 7.5 have been assigned before (34Sreeramulu S. Kumar J. Richter C. Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Langer T. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2005; 32: 262Google Scholar). Spectra of Cdc37M at pH 7.4 have been assigned by performing a pH series (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0) with 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid as an internal standard for calibration. Sequential backbone assignment of 15N-labeled Cdc37M in complex with unlabeled Hsp90N and vice versa was achieved by overlaying the 1H,15N-HSQC spectra of free Cdc37M (or Hsp90N) and Cdc37M (or Hsp90) in complex and verified by the NOE patterns from a high resolution three-dimensional 1H,15N-NOESY HSQC spectrum and selective 15N-amino acid labeling (alanine, arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine). Additionally, a three-dimensional 1H,15N-NOESY HSQC spectrum for Hsp90N with a tetra-selectively labeled sample in which only glycine, alanine, phenylalanine, and leucine were 15N-labeled was used to assist the assignment. 1D(H,N) RDCs were measured for the Cdc37M·Hsp90N complex (in which both proteins were 15N-labeled) in pf1 phage (5 g/liter, Profos) and in 4% polyacrylamide (PAA) gel alignment media at 700 MHz. The 1D (H,N) were extracted from IPAP-(1H,15N)-HSQC spectra (40Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson.. 1998; 131: 373-378Google Scholar, 41Wang Y.X. Marquardt J.L. Wingfield P. Stahl S.J. Lee-Huang S. Torchia D. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1998; 120: 7385-7386Google Scholar). Signals that could be traced back reliably and determined unambiguously were analyzed using MODULE (42Dosset P. Hus J.C. Marion D. Blackledge M. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2001; 20: 223-231Google Scholar) and PALES (43Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Google Scholar). CST experiments were carried out at 25 °C according to the procedure of Takahashi et al. (57Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Biol.. 2000; 7: 220-223Google Scholar). The sample contained 1 mm of 2H,15N,13 C-labeled Cdc37M protein with the unlabeled Hsp90N protein in 1H2O/2H2O (1:9, v/v) containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl. The Gaussian pulse scheme was used for saturation of aliphatic protons with irradiation frequency set to 1.1 ppm. A saturation time of 2.0 s was employed. X-ray Crystallography—Initial screening for crystallization conditions of Cdc37M was performed using screening kits purchased from JB (Jena Bioscience). These trials were successful, with five promising conditions producing crystals. The protein samples that did not give crystals were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which identified that they contained small fractions of proteins with an increased molecular mass of ∼75, 150, and 228 Da. We attributed this observation to the formation of mixed disulfides of β-mercaptoethanol with the four free cysteines of Cdc37M. Therefore, β-mercaptoethanol was omitted from the further protein preparations. The final diffracting quality crystals were grown from Cdc37M (Hepes, 50 mm, NaCl, 100 mm, pH 7.5, “protein buffer”) at a final concentration of 1.1 mm, in solution containing Hepes, 100 mm, pH 7.5, sodium acetate, 100 mm, 22% polyethylene glycol 4000, (“reservoir buffer”). Crystal drops were setup using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Crystals were transferred in a stepwise manner into solutions of increasing glycerol concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25%, respectively, based on one volume of protein buffer and two volumes of reservoir buffer, and flash-cooled in an X-Stream 2000 nitrogen stream at 140 K. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku R-Axis IV image plate detector at a wavelength of 1.5418 Å (CuKα radiation from a MicroMax-007 Microfocus generator). In addition to a high exposure data set consisting of 360 images of 1.0° rotations, a low exposure (one-third of the exposure time per image of that for high exposure) data set was collected consisting of 240 images of 1.5° rotations. The oscillation images were processed with the HKL/DENZO program package (44Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P61 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 48.67 Å and c = 104.26 Å. Scaling and merging of the oscillation images was performed with SCALEPACK (44Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Data reduction and approximate absolute scaling of the data were performed with TRUNCATE from the CCP4 program suite (45Collaborative Computation Project Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr.. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (46Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A.. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite, the diffraction data between 15 Å and 3 Å resolution, and a Cdc37 search model constructed from PDB entry 1US7 (32Roe S.M. Ali M.M.U. Meyer P. Vaughan C.K. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Cell.. 2004; 116: 87-98Google Scholar), extending from residue His-148 to residue Lys-276 and consisting of 1086 non-hydrogen atoms. The top solution with rotation angles α = 45.52°, β = 150.55°, γ = 311.52° and translations Tx = -0.3117 and Ty = 0.0954 (fractional coordinates) was associated with a correlation coefficient of 58.2% and an R-factor of 40.4%. After rigid body refinement with Refmac5 (47Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr.. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar), the R-factor for the data between 42.14 Å and 1.88 Å was 43.8% (RfreeT = 43.9%). After several cycles of restrained refinement with Refmac5, the modeling of tightly bound water molecules, and manual rebuilding with COOT (48Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar), the final structure was obtained. Docking—Calculation of the Cdc37M·Hsp90N complex was achieved using a high ambiguity driven docking (HADDOCK 2.0) approach with CNS 1.1 (49Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr.. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) essentially as described in the literature (36Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Google Scholar). The ambiguous interaction restraints have been defined for the residues that exhibited significant NMR amide chemical shift changes and/or strong saturation transfer upon interaction with its partner protein. For Hsp90, residues 117, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, and 129 have been defined as active and residues 28, 32, 40, 46, 51, 54, 55, 114, 116, 119, 120, 122, 127, 130, 132, 133, and 134 as passive. The helix (112-124) and adjacent loop region from residues 106-127 were left fully flexible to offer freedom to the orientation of this helix. Additional hydrogen-bond restraints were added to keep the secondary structure of this helix. For Cdc37M, residues 160, 161, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 193, 202, 204, 205, and 208 have been defined as active and residues 156, 157, 158, 169, 170, 174, 189, 192, 196, 197, 200, 201, 203, 207, 211, 242, and 249 as passive. The loop region 164-168 was left fully flexible during the docking. One intermolecular NOE (Ala-117-HN to Ala-204-HB), as obtained from NOESY experiments, fitted very well with the initial docking results and was included in the final calculation. To enhance the convergence, 1D(H,N) RDCs obtained both in 4% PAA gel and in 5 g/liter pf1 phage alignment media, were included in the calculation and the axial (Da) and rhombic (Dr) components of the alignment tensor were estimated using PALES (43Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Google Scholar). For the initial rigid-body docking, only the RDCs in the stable secondary structure elements were used, whereas in the further refinement steps, all RDCs were used. The final values for Da and Dr were -8.21 and 0.62 for the phage alignment and 9.39 and 0.45 for the alignment in the PAA gel. The dockings were performed using our Cdc37M crystal structure and the Hsp90 crystal structure (pdb: 1YES) (7Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell.. 1997; 89: 239-250Google Scholar). The protein allhdg 5.3 force field (50Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1999; 13: 51-59Google Scholar) was used for the calculations. The 200 final water-refined docking results are clustered at the interface within a threshold of 3.0 Å pairwise backbone r.m.s.d. The top-ranked ensemble, according to the average interaction energy and buried surface area, was accepted as the best representative of the complex. Comparing Different Constructs of Cdc37 and Hsp90—The study of the rather large complex formed between the 45-kDa Cdc37 protein and the 23-kDa N-terminal domain of Hsp90 is a challenge for NMR spectroscopic studies. To study this complex, we reduced the boundaries of Cdc37 to obtain a construct that retains its structural and functional properties and is suitable for NMR studies. Beside the Hsp90N binding domain of Cdc37 (147-276, Cdc37M), for which we recently published the NMR assignments (34Sreeramulu S. Kumar J. Richter C. Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Langer T. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2005; 32: 262Google Scholar), also the following Cdc37 constructs were investigated: full-length Cdc37 (1-378), the kinase binding domain (1-126, Cdc37N), and both kinase and Hsp90N binding domains (1-283, Cdc37NM). The suitability of the Cdc37 constructs for NMR was investigated by recording 1H,15N-TROSY spectra (Fig. 1). The spectrum of the full-length Cdc37 revealed considerable signal overlap and, in addition, signals that indicate unfolded regions (Fig. 1A). For Cdc37N, the spectrum shows again signal overlap and evidence for a high content of partially unfolded and/or helical regions (Fig. 1C). Cdc37M shows a nicely resolved high resolution 1H,15N-TROSY spectrum (with 131 out of the 133 expected amide resonances), which indicates that this Hsp90-binding domain of Cdc37 is properly folded (34Sreeramulu S. Kumar J. Richter C. Vogtherr M. Saxena K. Langer T. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2005; 32: 262Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). It was suspected that the Cdc37N might become more structured when it is together with the middle domain. Nevertheless, for the corresponding Cdc37NM construct the 1H,15N-TROSY spectra indicated insufficient chemical shift dispersion (Fig. 1B). The amide signals originating from Cdc37M (shown specifically for three peaks as in the insert in Fig. 1D) have the same chemical shifts as in the full-length Cdc37 and Cdc37NM (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that the fold of the Cdc37M is the same as in the full-length protein. Hence, the 16-kDa Cdc37M domain was used for all further NMR experiments. For Hsp90, the 23-kDa construct comprising the N-terminal ATP-binding domain (18-223) known to interact with Cdc37 was used throughout this study (35Jacobs D.M. Langer T. Elshorst B. Saxena K. Fiebig K.M. Vogtherr M. Schwalbe H. J. Biomol. NMR.. 2006; 36: 52Google Scholar). Structure of Human Cdc37M—In the x-ray structure of the complex between yeast Hsp90 and human Cdc37, the middle domain of the Cdc37 protein forms a homodimeric interaction with a symmetry-related molecule (32Roe S.M.

In this study, we investigated CL-P1-mediated binding and ingestion of yeast-derived zymosan bioparticles using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human CL-P1 (CHO/CL-P1) and human vascular endothelial cells constitutively expressed CL-P1. The uptake of zymosan by CHO/CL-P1 was dependent upon the level of CL-P1 expressed on the membrane and was inhibited by cytochalasin D and wortmannin. The binding of zymosan was also inhibited by ligands of other scavenger receptors such as poly(I) and dextran sulfate. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analyses showed that other scavenger receptors, namely LOX-1, Stabilin-2, or macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), were not expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells isolated from different individuals. Nonopsonic zymosan ingestion was inhibited in three primary cultured vascular endothelial cells, including different human umbilical vein endothelial cells from nine individuals treated with CL-P1 small interfering RNAs, although small interfering RNAs of other scavenger receptors had no effect on zymosan uptake in these cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that CL-P1 is expressed in human and murine vascular endothelial layers. Our results demonstrated that CL-P1 predominantly mediated phagocytosis for fungi in vascular endothelia.

Scavenger receptors are integral membrane proteins consisting at least eight different subclasses (Class A to Class H), with little amino acid sequence homology, that bind to a wide variety of ligands, including modified or oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDLs), 2The abbreviations used are: oxLDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; CL-P1, collectin placenta 1; LOX-1, lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells; FEEL-1, fascilin, epidermal growth factor-like, laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like, and link domain containing scavenger receptor-1; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; CR, complement receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab; HUAEC, human umbilical artery endothelial cell; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell. 2The abbreviations used are: oxLDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; CL-P1, collectin placenta 1; LOX-1, lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells; FEEL-1, fascilin, epidermal growth factor-like, laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like, and link domain containing scavenger receptor-1; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; CR, complement receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab; HUAEC, human umbilical artery endothelial cell; HAEC, human aortic endothelial cell. apoptotic cells, and microbial pathogens (1Murphy J.E. Tedbury P.R. Homer-Vanniasinkam S. Walker J.H. Ponnambalam S. Atherosclerosis.. 2005; 182: 1-15Google Scholar). Among these ligands, oxLDLs are considered to have an important role in interactions with endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells in the development of atherosclerosis according to Ross's response-to-injury hypothesis (2Goldstein J.L.

Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar), a type II transmembrane protein with a coiled-coil, a collagen-like domain, and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and showed it to be a scavenger receptor, in addition to its role as a collectin (Colec12). This molecule resembles a Class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) in its structure except for the replacement of the cysteine-rich domain by a CRD (11Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature.. 1990; 343: 531-535Google Scholar). CL-P1 can bind to oxLDL without interacting with other modified LDLs such as acetyl-LDL. Interestingly, we found that CL-P1 expression in HUVECs was up-regulated after the induction of oxidative stress in vitro and was increased in aortic endothelia in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model (12Koyama S. Ohtani K. Jang S. Itabe H. Fukuzawa J. Suzuki Y. Wakamiya N. Glycoconj. J.. 2005; 22: 281Google Scholar). Another reported finding on the ability of CL-P1 to mediate the binding of yeast, as well as Gram-negative and -positive bacteria in CL-P1-transfected CHO cells, strongly suggested a significant role for CL-P1 in host defense (10Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar).Phagocytosis in mammals is a process that involves the binding and internalization of pathogens and is essential for host defense. It is mainly achieved through the action of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages as “professional” phagocytes (13Brown E.J. BioEssays.. 1995; 17: 109-117Google Scholar). The phagocytic process is mediated by a large number of different receptors that facilitate the attachment of particles on the cell surface. These receptors may interact with targets, either directly through structural determinants present on the target surface (nonopsonic phagocytosis) or indirectly through opsonins supplied by the host (opsonin-dependent phagocytosis) (14Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol.. 2002; 14: 103-110Google Scholar). Currently, the well characterized opsonin receptors are Fcγ-receptor (FcγR) and complement receptor 3 (CR3), which bind to the Fc portion of IgG and complement iC3b, respectively (15Swanson J.A. Baer S.C. Trends Cell Biol.. 1995; 5: 89-92Google Scholar).In recent reports, Dectin-1, a type II transmembrane receptor containing a single extracellular C-type lectin domain, was shown to mediate phagocytosis of particles containing β-glucan, a major structural component of fungal cell walls. Dectin-1 is expressed widely in phagocytes, including macrophages and dendritic cells, and interacts with β-glucans (16Brown G.D. Gordon S. Nature.. 2001; 413: 36-37Google Scholar, 17Brown G.D. Taylor P.R. Reid D.M. Willment J.A. Williams D.L. Martinez-Pomares L. Wong S.Y. Gordon S. J. Exp. Med.. 2002; 196: 407-412Google Scholar). Dectin-1 and Toll-like receptor 2 were reported to collaborate in coordinating inflammatory responses, such as cytokine secretion and the production of reactive oxygen species, in response to β-glucan-containing particles (18Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Underhill D.M. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1277-1286Google Scholar). Another novel c-type lectin, SIGN-R1, which is highly expressed in macrophages in the marginal zone of spleen, mediates the uptake of polysaccharides and encapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae (19Gantner B.N. Simmons R.M. Canavera S.J. Akira S. Underhill D.M. J. Exp. Med.. 2003; 197: 1107-1117Google Scholar). Some scavenger receptors have also been shown to bind to various microbes, including bacteria and yeast. Of special note, studies on SR-A knock-out mice have revealed an enhanced sensitivity to both Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria infection. This suggested the important roles of SR-A scavenger receptor in innate immunity and in cross-talk with acquired immunity (20Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyada Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y. Horiuchi S.

Thromb.. 1997; 4: 1-11Google Scholar).In this study, we investigated CL-P1-mediated phagocytosis of zymosan by human vascular endothelial cells as well as by CHO/CL-P1, and we characterized its recognition in the phagocytic process. The role of CL-P1 in fungal phagocytosis in human vascular endothelia is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Ham's F-12 medium was purchased from Sigma. Endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2) with bullet kit additives and primary human vascular endothelial cells were from Cambrex (La Jolla, CA). Texas Red-conjugated zymosan A bioparticles, rabbit anti-zymosan Ab, and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Invitrogen. Antibodies to CL-P1 were obtained using the recombinant CRD of human CL-P1 in Escherichia coli. Cytochalasin D and wortmannin were from Calbiochem. Poly(I), poly(C), and dextran sulfate (500 kDa) were from Sigma. The preparation of oxidized LDL was carried out as described previously (10Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar). Other chemicals, unless mentioned otherwise, were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—CHO/ldlA7 and CHO/CL-P1 cells were cultured as described previously (10Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar). Three types of human primary endothelial cells were used. HUVECs (nine clones from different donors), human umbilical artery endothelial cells (HUAEC), and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were maintained according to the supplier's directions (Cambrex, La Jolla, CA). All experiments with HUVECs were performed between the third and sixth passages. In cases of HUAEC and HAEC, all experiments were performed between the fifth and eighth passages.RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of each RNA sample was measured using an Ultrospec2000 spectrometer (GE Healthcare). Only RNA samples with a 260/280 ratio (an indication of protein contamination) between 1.9 and 2.0 were used for the analysis. Reverse transcription (RT) reaction from 1 μg of RNA template was performed using TaqMan reverse transcriptase reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A real time PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 real time PCR system, and the collected data were analyzed with 7500 System SDS software, version 1.3, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The threshold cycle (Ct) values for each transcript were compared with those for 18 S rRNA, which remained relatively constant in abundance. Primers and probes used to confirm all transcripts were proprietary oligonucleotides obtained from TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) and utilized a 5′-FAM reporter and a 3′-nonfluorescent minor groove binder (supplemental Table 1). All PCRs were performed in 96-well optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) applying the following conditions: 2 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. Triplicate real time RT-PCR analyses were executed for each sample, and the obtained Ct values were averaged. Using the comparative Ct method described in the manual from Applied Biosystems, gene expression was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene 18 S rRNA, yielding the ΔCt value. The average ΔCt value obtained from the negative control was then subtracted from the average ΔCt value of each corresponding sample, yielding the ΔΔCt value. The gene expression level, normalized to that of the housekeeping gene, and relative to the control sample, was calculated using 2-ΔΔCt. Data were normalized to an untreated, negative control arbitrarily set at 1.siRNA Transfection—CL-P1 siRNAs and other siRNAs were purchased as four oligonucleotide siGENOME SmartPools or ON-TARGETplus SmartPools (Dharmacon Research, Inc.), each containing about 50% guanidine-cytosine content (supplemental Table 2). The negative control sequence used was fluorescein siRNA having no perfect matches to known human genes (Dharmacon Research, Inc.). Lamin siRNA was commercially available as a SmartPool (Dharmacon Research, Inc.). HUVECs were trypsinized, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended (106 cells) in HUVEC solution (Amaxa Biosystems) containing 1-2 μm siRNA duplex, and were then transfected using a Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. The negative control siRNA-treated HUVECs were used as a mock transfection. After transfection, cells were immediately plated in collagen-coated dishes containing pre-warmed complete medium. After 48 h, cells were transferred to 35-mm collagen-coated dishes or collagen gel coverslips, and 24 h later, they were either lysed or subjected to phagocytosis assays, as described.Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, and protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary Ab. Immune complexes were collected at 4 °C for 3 h with protein G-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The final pellets were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), and residual binding sites on the filters were blocked by incubation with Block Ace blocking buffer (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co.) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the appropriate antibodies and developed using an ECL (GE Healthcare). The results were visualized using an LAS-3000 (Fuji Photo Film Co.).Binding and Phagocytosis Assays—For the zymosan binding assay, CHO/CL-P1 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with nonlabeled or Texas Red-conjugated zymosan A bioparticles. After binding, cells were washed and then fixed at room temperature for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Texas Red-conjugated zymosan A was the source of particles for phagocytosis assays. For most experiments, zymosan A was added at a final concentration of 10 particles per cell. All endothelial cells grown on collagen gel coverslips were overlaid with zymosan A. The cells were then incubated with the particles for 2 h at 37 °C. External particles were labeled in the cold with rabbit anti-zymosan Ab and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Particles that were red color-positive but Alexa Fluor 488 (green color)-negative were considered to be internalized. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with Hoechst 33342 obtained from Invitrogen. To block the phagocytosis of zymosan particles, the transfected CHO/CL-P1 cells or HUVECs were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the appropriate inhibitors diluted in serum-free Ham's F-12 or EBM-2 basal medium prior to the addition of zymosan. We verified that the preincubation time and temperature were optimal to obtain an efficient blockade of phagocytosis. Fluorescent particles were visualized using the Olympus IX70-23FL/DIC-SP and SPOT2-SP system (Olympus Co. Ltd.). Phagocytosis was quantified using the total number of internalized zymosan particles per 100 cells as the phagocytic index (>1000 cells were counted). After the same staining, phagocytosed bioparticles were observed under an Olympus FLUOVIEW 1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope and analyzed using ASW software (version 3.1). All experiments were independently performed at least three times, and data are expressed as means ± S.D.Flow Cytometry—Immunofluorescent flow cytometry was performed with several CHO/CL-P1 transfectants. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-CL-P1 mAb and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 4 °C for 30 min and assayed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry analyses showed that the x axis was fluorescence intensity (FL1-H) of CL-P1 and the y axis was cells counts.Immunohistochemistry—Transgenic Tie-2-lacZ mice expressing β-galactosidase under the control of the endothelium-specific protein Tie-2 promoter were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). An endothelium-specific enhancer was introduced into the first intron of the mouse Tie-2 gene. A combination of the Tie-2 promoter with the intron fragment containing this enhancer allows for specific and uniform gene expression in virtually all vascular endothelial cells throughout embryogenesis and adulthood. Mice were anesthetized and perfused with 0.9% NaCl solution and subsequently perfusion-fixed with 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.2) for 2 and 10 min, respectively. Mouse hearts were collected and treated as described elsewhere (10Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar). Specimens were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm-thick paraffin sections using rabbit anti-CL-P1 Ab or anti-β-galactosidase mAb (Dako, Denmark), and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with biotin (Vector Laboratories), and streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). In case of human heart, cryo-embedded sections were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 10-μm-thick sections using rabbit anti-CL-P1 Ab or anti-CD31 mAb (Dako, Denmark), and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with biotin (Vector Laboratories), and streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with TO-PRO-3 iodide obtained from Invitrogen. The fluorescent images were observed under an Olympus FLUOVIEW 1000 confocal laser-scanning microscope and analyzed using ASW software (version 3.1).Statistics—Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of the specified number of experiments performed in triplicate. The significance of difference was determined by a paired or unpaired Student's t test. Unless otherwise stated, data are not significantly different from control values.RESULTSPhagocytosis of Zymosan by CL-P1 cDNA-transfected CHO Cells—We transfected human CL-P1 cDNA into CHO-ldlA7 cells (lacking functional LDL receptors) and chose three stable clones on the basis of the expression level of CL-P1 determined using flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). The phagocytic properties of CL-P1 cDNA-transfected CHO cells (CHO/CL-P1) were evaluated by quantifying the amount of internalized zymosan particles as red-colored dots using a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 1B). CHO/CL-P1 cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated zymosan particles for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound zymosan particles were washed, and external zymosan particles were labeled in the cold (at 4 °C) with rabbit anti-zymosan Ab and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Those zymosan particles that were Texas Red-positive but Alexa Fluor 488-negative were considered to be internalized. The phagocytic index was calculated from the number of internalized zymosan particles per 100 cells. Some phagocytosed cells became larger than others (Fig. 1B, phase contrast view). The binding and internalization of zymosan were also analyzed simultaneously by laser-confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 1C). The amounts of attached and phagocytosed zymosan in these cells were dependent on the surface expression level of the scavenger receptor, CL-P1 (Fig. 1D). The binding of zymosan was inhibited by ligands of scavenger receptor and polyanionic substances (poly(I) and dextran sulfate) as in the case of oxLDL binding (10Ohtani K. Suzuki Y. Eda S. Kawai T. Kase T. Keshi H. Sakai Y. Fukuoh A. Sakamoto T. Itabe H. Suzutani T. Ogasawara M. Yoshida I. Wakamiya N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 44222-44228Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A-C and G). Cytochalasin D, an antagonist of actin assembly, disturbed zymosan uptake (Fig. 3, A-C), and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, inhibited uptake mediated by CL-P1 (Fig. 3, D-F) similar to the phenomena seen in macrophages. In contrast, CL-P1-mediated binding of zymosan was not inhibited by treatment with wortmannin and cytochalasin D in CHO/CL-P1 (Fig. 2, E-G). The morphological change in cytochalasin D-treated cells caused by interference of cytoskeletal assembly did not affect the binding of zymosan (Fig. 3, C and F).FIGURE 2Binding of zymosan to CHO/CL-P1 cells. CHO/CL-P1 cells were permanent transfectants of CL-P1. Texas Red-labeled zymosan was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with CHO/CL-P1. A-F, zymosan bound to the cell surface of CHO/CL-P1. The binding of zymosan was inhibited by dextran sulfate (B) and poly(I) (C) but not by poly(C) (D) or two phagocytic inhibitors of wortmannin and cytochalasin D (E and F). A is a nontreated control. Red spots are zymosan particles bound to the cell surface, and blue spots indicate nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst 43322 (scale bars, 100 μm for all images).

A minimum of 200 cells was counted per experiment. **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of phagocytic inhibitors on nonopsonic zymosan phagocytosis. A-C, cytochalasin D (CytoD) treatment inhibited CL-P1-mediated zymosan phagocytosis. D-F, wortmannin treatment also inhibited CL-P1-mediated zymosan phagocytosis. CHO/CL-P1 cells were permanent transfectants of CL-P1. The cells were allowed to internalize zymosan for 2 h before analysis.

Furthermore, treatment with either cytochalasin D or wortmannin inhibited nonopsonic zymosan phagocytosis but had no effect on zymosan binding (Fig. 4, E-G).FIGURE 4Nonopsonic zymosan phagocytosis in HUVECs. A-F, representation of nonopsonic zymosan binding and phagocytosis in HUVECs is as follows: control, A; scavenger receptor ligands such as oxLDL, B; dextran sulfate (the same as poly(I)), C; poly(C), D; wortmannin, E; and cytochalasin D, F. Yellow particles are extracellular adherent zymosans; red particles are intracellular zymosans, and blue particles indicate nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst 43322 (scale bars, 100 μm for all images).

Phagocytosis was quantified using the total number of internalized zymosan particles per 100 cells as the phagocytic index. Each bar represents the percentage of phagocytosis compared with the untreated HUVEC. The phagocytic index was 30.7 ± 11.2 in the negative control HUVEC (clone 2F-1899).

We quantified each scavenger receptor in primary cultured HUVECs with real time RT-PCR (Fig. 5A and Table 1). HUVECs mainly expressed CL-P1, SR-B1, and CD36 mRNAs. No expression of LOX-1 and FEEL-2/Stabilin-2 was observed in early passaged HUVECs, whereas LOX-1 was faintly detected in long passaged cells. In early passaged cells, levels of expression of SREC and FEEL-1/Stabilin-1 were also very low. These results suggest that CL-P1 is a major scavenger receptor in vascular endothelial cells. The expression of mRNAs encoding a variety of phagocytic receptors (CR1, CR2, CR3, and FcγRs) could not be detected or little in vitro cultivated HUVECs was detected by real time RT-PCR (Table 1). Although expressions of FcγRII and CD11c/CD18 (CR4) were detected, mRNA levels were about 1000 times lower than CL-P1. The mRNA of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) known to modulate IgG transport in endothelial cells was detected three times higher than that of CL-P1.FIGURE 5Depletion of scavenger receptor CL-P1 by siRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2170696291,"Activation of a number of class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is thought to involve two molecular switches, a rotamer toggle switch within the transmembrane domain and an ionic lock at the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor; however, the mechanism by which agonist binding changes these molecular interactions is not understood. Importantly, 80% of GPCRs including free fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) lack the complement of amino acid residues implicated in either or both of these two switches; the mechanism of activation of these GPCRs is therefore less clear. By homology modeling, we identified two Glu residues (Glu-145 and Glu-172) in the second extracellular loop of FFAR1 that form putative interactions individually with two transmembrane Arg residues (Arg-183(5.39) and Arg-258(7.35)) to create two ionic locks. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding of agonists to FFAR1 leads to breakage of these Glu-Arg interactions. In mutagenesis experiments, breakage of these two putative interactions by substituting Ala for Glu-145 and Glu-172 caused constitutive receptor activation. Our results therefore reveal a molecular switch for receptor activation present on the extracellular surface of FFAR1 that is broken by agonist binding. Similar ionic locks between the transmembrane domains and the extracellular loops may constitute a mechanism common to other class A GPCRs also."
https://openalex.org/W2006842959,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is highly conserved throughout evolution and regulates cell size and survival and cell cycle progression. It regulates the latter by stimulating procession through G1 and the G1/S phase transition. Entry into S phase requires an abundant supply of purine nucleotides, but the effect of the PI3K/Akt pathway on purine synthesis has not been studied. We now show that the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates both de novo and salvage purine nucleotide synthesis in insulin-responsive mouse mesenchymal cells. We found that serum and insulin stimulated de novo purine synthesis in serum-starved cells largely through PI3K/Akt signaling, and pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PI3K/Akt reduced de novo synthesis by 75% in logarithmically growing cells. PI3K/Akt regulated early steps of de novo synthesis by modulating phosphoribosylpyrophosphate production by the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and late steps by modulating activity of the bifunctional enzyme aminoimidazole-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase IMP cyclohydrolase, an enzyme not previously known to be regulated. The effects of PI3K/Akt on purine nucleotide salvage were likely through regulating phosphoribosylpyrophosphate availability.

Activated Akt regulates several intracellular processes including protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, and cell cycle progression (1Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res.. 1999; 253: 210-229Google Scholar, 2Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell.. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Google Scholar). Frequently regulation occurs at more than one step. (i) Akt increases protein synthesis by activating mTOR, which regulates the activities of S6 kinase-1 and 4E-BP1, two translational regulators (3Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Google Scholar). (ii) Akt regulates glucose metabolism by inducing translocation of glucose transporters to the cell surface, by activating hexokinase, and by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3 (4Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Google Scholar). (iii) Akt stimulates the cell cycle by phosphorylating, and thereby inhibiting, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip/WAF1 and p27Kip1 and the FOXO transcription factors and through phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3, which regulates the G1 cyclins, cyclins D and E (2Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell.. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Google Scholar, 5Liang J. Slingerland J.M. Cell Cycle.. 2003; 2: 339-345Google Scholar). The de novo synthesis of purines consists of 10 sequential steps, starting with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and ending with IMP; the latter is converted to AMP or GMP (see Fig. 1). PRPP amidotransferase catalyzes the first committed step of the pathway (see Fig. 1, reaction 2) and is subject to feedback inhibition by purine nucleotides; therefore, it has been considered a major point of pathway regulation (6Holmes E.W. Wyngaarden J.B. Kelley W.N. J. Biol. Chem.. 1973; 248: 6035-6040Google Scholar). We showed previously that production of ribose 5-phosphate, the immediate precursor of PRPP and an end product of the pentose phosphate pathway, also contributes to the regulation of purine synthesis (7Pilz R.B. Willis R.C. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 2927-2935Google Scholar). Salvage purine nucleotide synthesis involves hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of hypoxanthine or guanine to IMP, a PRPP-requiring reaction (see Fig. 1, reaction 6). Although no previous studies have assessed whether the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates purine synthesis, several lines of evidence suggest that this may indeed be the case. First, the intracellular ATP concentration is decreased in mouse embryo fibroblasts that lack Akt1 and Akt2 (8Hahn-Windgassen A. Nogueira V. Chen C.C. Skeen J.E. Sonenberg N. Hay N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 32081-32089Google Scholar). Second, treating keratinocytes with epidermal or keratinocyte growth factor, both of which activate PI3K and Akt, increases expression of several purine synthetic enzymes (9Gassmann M.G. Stanzel A. Werner S. Oncogene.. 1999; 18: 6667-6676Google Scholar). Third, the intracellular ATP concentration is 3 times higher in Rat1a fibroblasts that overexpress myristoylated, constitutively active Akt compared with control cells (8Hahn-Windgassen A. Nogueira V. Chen C.C. Skeen J.E. Sonenberg N. Hay N. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 32081-32089Google Scholar, 10Gottlob K. Majewski N. Kennedy S. Kandel E. Robey R.B. Hay N. Genes Dev.. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Google Scholar). Although the concentrations of ADP and AMP were not reported, their intracellular concentrations are considerably less than ATP, and thus the increased ATP likely arose from increased purine synthesis rather than from increased ADP and AMP phosphorylation. Finally in the IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell line FL5.12, activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is higher in cells expressing myristoylated Akt than in control cells and does not decrease on removing IL-3 as occurs in control cells (4Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Google Scholar). Similarly increased pentose phosphate pathway activity on antigen receptor cross-linking of B lymphocytes is attenuated by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (11Doughty C.A. Bleiman B.F. Wagner D.J. Dufort F.J. Mataraza J.M. Roberts M.F. Chiles T.C. Blood.. 2006; 107: 4458-4465Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed possible that PI3K/Akt regulate purine synthesis. Materials—Antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and an anti-tubulin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An expression vector encoding human Akt1 with a myristoylation signal sequence was from J. R. Woodgett (Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada) and human ATIC was produced as described previously (12Wolan D.W. Greasley S.E. Beardsley G.P. Wilson I.A. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 15505-15513Google Scholar). LY294002, LY303511, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem; 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-4-ribofuranoside (AICA-riboside) and AICA-riboside monophosphate (AICAR) were from Sigma-Aldrich; 5-formyltetrahydrofolate was from Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland); and AG 50 resin was from Bio-Rad. LY294002 and LY303511 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and when added to cells yielded a final DMSO concentration of 0.2%; cells not treated with either drug also received 0.2% DMSO, referred to as vehicle. [14C]Formate, [8-14C]adenine, [8-14C]hypoxanthine, [1-14C]glucose, and [6-14C]glucose were from Moravek (Brea, CA). Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—C2C12 mouse mesenchymal cells were from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC), and tuberin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts were provided by D. J. Kwiatkowski (13Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig.. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Google Scholar); both cell types were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells from the ATCC were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. In some experiments, cells were transfected 48 h prior to use with a cDNA plasmid or siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. To reduce endogenous Akt1, two siRNAs targeting different Akt1 sequences were used: Akt1 siRNA1 was from Dharmacon, and Akt1 siRNA2 had the sequence UGCCCUUCUACAACCAGGA. An siRNA targeting green fluorescent protein was used as a control. Measurement of Rates of de Novo Purine Synthesis—Rates of de novo purine synthesis were measured as described previously by following [14C]formate incorporation into all cellular purine nucleotides, i.e. the soluble purine nucleotide pool as well as purines incorporated into newly synthesized DNA and RNA (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar). Briefly cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes at 5 × 105 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. About 18 h later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, placed in 1 ml of fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, and incubated for 2 h with 0.2% DMSO, 20 μm LY294002, 20 μm LY303511, or 100 nm wortmannin. In experiments where cells were serum-starved, they were incubated for 14 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS; some cells received either 10% FBS (serum-stimulated) or 10 nm insulin for 2 h in the absence or presence of 20 μm LY294002. After the 2-h incubation with drugs, [14C]formate (10 μCi; specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol) was added for 2 h, and then the cells were extracted in situ in 0.4 n perchloric acid. Cell lysates were boiled for 70 min to release purine bases from DNA, RNA, and purine nucleotides, and then the samples were cooled on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. The clarified lysates were loaded onto 0.5 × 5-cm AG 50 columns, which were washed with 0.1 n HCl to remove unreacted [14C]formate; purine bases were eluted from the columns in 6 n HCl. Radioactivity in the column eluates was measured by liquid scintillation counting, and the data are expressed as [14C]formate incorporation into purines/h/106 cells. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, the assay was linear with time to at least 3 h. In addition, the assay was linear with cell number to at least 1 × 106 cells/well, and all subsequent assays using radioactive labels were linear with time and cell number. To measure [14C]formate incorporation into adenine and guanine separately, the AG 50 column eluates were dried under vacuum, resuspended in 50 μl of water, and spotted on cellulose acetate thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates. The plates were developed in butanol/acetonitrile/water (65:20:20), spots corresponding to adenine and guanine were cut out, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In some experiments, de novo purine synthesis was measured following glycine incorporation into purines (15Martin Jr., D.W. Owen N.T. J. Biol. Chem.. 1972; 247: 5477-5485Google Scholar). Briefly [14C]glycine (10 μCi; specific activity, 54 mCi/mmol) was added to cells instead of [14C]formate, 2 h later the cells were lysed in perchloric acid, and the lysates were boiled as described above. After cooling the lysates on ice, KHCO3 was added to neutralize the perchloric acid, and insoluble potassium perchlorate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were dried, and adenine and guanine in the samples were separated from unreacted [14C]glycine by TLC as described above. The data are expressed as [14C]glycine incorporation into purines/h/106 cells. Measurement of PRPP Availability—Incorporation of [8-14C]adenine into adenine nucleotides by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase requires intracellular PRPP and can be used to measure cellular PRPP availability (7Pilz R.B. Willis R.C. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 2927-2935Google Scholar). Cells were plated as described for measuring de novo purine synthesis. After a 3-h incubation with the indicated drugs, [8-14C]adenine (0.2 μCi; specific activity, 56 mCi/mmol) was added to the cells, and 30 min later cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in water. The cell lysates were placed on 2 × 2-cm squares of diethylaminoethyl cellulose paper (DE-81, Whatman), which were washed four times in 1 mm ammonium formate to remove unincorporated [8-14C]adenine. Radioactivity in adenine nucleotides, which remain bound to the cellulose squares, was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Measurement of Carbon Flow through the Pentose Phosphate Pathway—Carbon flow through the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway was measured by following [6-14C]glucose incorporation into ATP as described previously (16Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1985; 260: 6054-6059Google Scholar). Briefly C2C12 cells were incubated as described for measuring rates of de novo purine synthesis except [6-14C]glucose (10 μCi; specific activity, 45 mCi/mmol) replaced the formate label. The cells were extracted in 0.4 n perchloric acid, the extracts were neutralized with KHCO3, and the extracts were fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a strong anion exchange column eluted with a linear gradient from 10 mm NH4PO4, pH 4.0 to 480 mm NH4PO4, pH 4.0 over 75 min. Fractions containing ATP were collected, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Although this method potentially includes carbon flow through the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, it predominantly measures flow through the non-oxidative branch because the latter provides the majority of ribose 5-phosphate used in purine synthesis (16Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1985; 260: 6054-6059Google Scholar, 17Raivio K.O. Lazar C.S. Krumholz H.R. Becker M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1981; 678: 51-57Google Scholar, 18Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Cascante M. Lee W.N. Brandes J.L. Bassilian S. Yusuf F.I. Williams R.D. Muscarella P. Melvin W.S. Schirmer W.J. Cancer Res.. 1997; 57: 4242-4248Google Scholar, 19Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.N. Pancreas.. 2001; 22: 1-7Google Scholar). Carbon flow through the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway was measured by following CO2 release from [1-14C]glucose as described previously (16Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1985; 260: 6054-6059Google Scholar). Briefly 1 × 106 HEL cells were incubated in 16 × 100-mm glass tubes containing 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and 10% dialyzed FBS. The tubes were capped tightly with a rubber septum that held a plastic center well (Kontes Glass Co.) containing a fluted piece of Whatman No. 1 filter paper saturated with 1 n NaOH. After a 2-h equilibration period with or without 20 μm LY294002 or LY303511, 10 μCi of [1-14C]glucose (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) was added to the cells by piercing a Hamilton syringe through the rubber septum. At the end of the incubation, the center well was transferred to a scintillation vial, and radioactivity trapped in the NaOH was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Because these experiments must be performed in a sealed system, they were performed on suspension (HEL) cells in capped tubes rather than on surface-adherent cells. Measurement of PRPP Synthetase and ATIC Activity—Cells incubated for 3 h in 0.2% DMSO or 20 μm LY294002 were extracted by three 10-s bursts of sonication on ice, and the extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. For measuring PRPP synthetase activity, the extract buffer and assay conditions were as described by Torres et al. (20Torres R.J. Mateos F.A. Puig J.G. Becker M.A. Clin. Chim. Acta.. 1996; 245: 105-112Google Scholar). For measuring ATIC activity, cells were extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The assay contained 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthesized from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate as described by Rabinowitz (21Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol.. 1963; 6: 814-815Google Scholar) and was performed as described by Mueller and Benkovic (22Mueller W.T. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry.. 1981; 20: 337-344Google Scholar) with the following changes. (i) 1 mm β-glycerophosphate and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate were included to inhibit nonspecific phosphatases, and 2 mm α,β-methylene adenosine diphosphate (AOPCP) was included to inhibit 5′-nucleotidase activity (23Boss G.R. Thompson L.F. Spiegelberg H.L. Pichler W.J. Seegmiller J.E. J. Immunol.. 1980; 125: 679-682Google Scholar). (ii) The IMP product was separated from the AICAR substrate (and AOPCP) by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column eluted with a linear gradient from 20 mm K2PO4, pH 5.5 to 60% aqueous methanol. The assay measures both AICAR transformylase and IMP cyclohydrolase activity. Protein in the cell extracts was measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and enzyme activities were measured at two time points. Measurement of Intracellular Purine Nucleotides—Intracellular purine nucleotides were measured as described previously (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar). Briefly about 10 × 106 C2C12 cells were extracted rapidly in ice-cold 0.4 n perchloric acid, precipitated macromolecules were removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were neutralized with KHCO3. Purine nucleotides in the samples were analyzed by HPLC on a strong anion exchange column using the same system as described for following [6-14C]glucose incorporation into ATP. Measurement of the Early and Late Steps of the de Novo Purine Synthesis Pathway—Rates of the early steps of the de novo purine synthesis pathway were measured by following [14C]formate incorporation into formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) as described previously (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar). Briefly cells were incubated with a 10 μm concentration of the glutamine analog azaserine; this azaserine concentration inhibits formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (Fig. 1, reaction 4) but has minimal effect on other glutamine-requiring processes, such as protein synthesis (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar, 25Henderson J.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1962; 237: 2631-2635Google Scholar, 26Boss G.R. Biochem. J.. 1987; 242: 425-431Google Scholar). After a 45-min incubation with azaserine, [14C]formate was added, and 2 h later cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in acetonitrile/water (50:50). After centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins, supernatants were spotted on cellulose acetate TLC plates and developed in a butanol/acetone/water/acetic acid/ammonium hydroxide (35:35:22.5:15:2.5) system. The plates were exposed to x-ray film, and FGAR was identified on the autoradiographs based on its Rf value in the TLC system and its presence only in azaserine-treated cells (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar, 27Boyle J.A. Raivio K.O. Becker M.A. Seegmiller J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1972; 269: 179-183Google Scholar). Corresponding areas on the TLC plates were cut out, and radioactivity in FGAR was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Rates of the last two steps of the de novo purine synthesis pathway were measured as described for measuring total de novo purine synthesis except 10 μm azaserine and 200 μm AICA-riboside were added to the cells (14Boss G.R.

The azaserine was present to inhibit the early steps of the de novo pathway, thereby making purine synthesis dependent on the exogenously added AICA-riboside. Measurement of Purine Synthesis by the Salvage Pathway—Purine synthesis by the salvage pathway was assessed by measuring [8-14C]hypoxanthine incorporation into purine nucleotides as described previously (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar). The assay was the same as described for measuring de novo purine synthesis except the cells were incubated with 10 μCi of [8-14C]hypoxanthine (specific activity, 47 mCi/mmol). Western Blots—Western blots were performed as described previously using chemiluminescence detection (28Scheele J.S. Pilz R.B. Quilliam L.A. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 18599-18606Google Scholar). Cells were extracted in situ in hot SDS sample buffer and applied to 8% polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibody. Data Presentation and Analysis—All data presented in bar and line graphs are the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad, Carlsbad, CA). Student's t test was used for paired comparisons, and a one-way analysis of variance with a Dunnett's or Bonferroni post-test analysis was used for multiple comparisons with the control group or comparisons across experimental conditions, respectively. Effect of Akt Inhibition on de Novo Purine Synthesis—To determine whether the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates de novo purine synthesis, we treated C2C12 cells with LY294002 for 2 h and found that the drug reduced [14C]formate incorporation into purines by >75% over the ensuing 2 h (Fig. 2a). Rates of purine synthesis were reduced during the earliest time interval that could be measured, i.e. the first 30 min after adding the formate label, and remained reduced for at least 3 h (supplemental Fig. S1; all subsequent measurements with the formate label were performed at 2 h, well within the linear range of the assay). LY303511, which is structurally similar to LY294002 but does not inhibit PI3K (29Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Google Scholar), had no significant effect on purine synthesis (Fig. 2a), whereas wortmannin, another PI3K inhibitor, also severely reduced purine synthesis (data not shown). Starving cells for serum for 15 h reduced purine synthesis, and adding back serum or insulin returned purine synthesis rates toward those of control, non-starved cells; under all three conditions, LY294002 significantly inhibited rates of purine synthesis (Fig. 2a). We confirmed that LY294002 inhibited Akt activation by assessing Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 and threonine 308 (Fig. 2a). LY303511 had no effect on Akt phosphorylation, and serum starvation partially reduced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2a). The marked reduction of purine synthesis in serum-starved cells in the presence of some residual Akt activity suggests that serum regulates purine synthesis in part through non-PI3K/Akt mechanisms; further reduction in purine synthesis by LY294002 in serum-starved cells is consistent with this hypothesis. However, that LY294002 largely prevented serum and insulin from restoring purine synthesis in serum-starved cells indicates that PI3K/Akt signaling is critical to serum and insulin regulation of purine synthesis. Because formate is incorporated into purines via 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1, reactions 3 and 5), decreased tetrahydrofolate availability would decrease apparent rates of purine synthesis using a [14C]formate label. However, LY294002 reduced purine synthesis to a similar extent in folic acid-supplemented cells as in non-supplemented cells (Fig. 2b). Further evidence that LY294002 directly inhibited purine synthesis was that the drug inhibited [14C]glycine incorporation into purines to a similar extent as [14C]formate incorporation (Fig. 2c). The inactive analog LY303511 had no significant effect on [14C]glycine incorporation into purines, and supplementing cells with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, which is in rapid equilibrium with 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, did not attenuate the effect of LY294002 (Fig. 2c); the latter experiment confirmed that LY294002 was not acting by reducing 10-formyltetrahydrofolate availability. To determine whether regulation of purine synthesis by the PI3K/Akt cassette occurred distal to PI3K, we reduced Akt1 expression in C2C12 cells using an siRNA approach (none of the commercially available Akt inhibitors significantly reduced Akt activity over the relatively short time period of our experiments). Two different Akt1 siRNAs significantly reduced purine synthesis, whereas a control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 2d; the control siRNA was targeted to green fluorescent protein; rates of purine synthesis with this siRNA were similar to those in untreated cells shown in Fig. 2, a and b). Neither Akt1 siRNA reduced purine synthesis to the same extent as LY294002, which is likely related to the siRNAs only partially reducing Akt protein and Akt activation (Fig. 2d, Western blots; only Akt protein is shown). Expressing myristoylated human Akt1 in C2C12 cells treated with Akt1 siRNA1 returned rates of purine synthesis to those found in cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2d; these experiments could not be performed with Akt1 siRNA2 because the latter was directed to a sequence common to the mouse and human genes). Expressing myristoylated Akt1 in otherwise untreated cells increased rates of purine synthesis, but the increase did not reach statistical significance. Because LY294002 more effectively inhibited Akt activation than Akt1 siRNAs, subsequent experiments were performed with LY294002 using LY303511 as a negative control. To examine whether PI3K/Akt regulate purine synthesis via the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway, we performed two separate sets of experiments. First, we studied tuberin (Tsc2)-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts; tuberin regulates mTOR activity by serving as a Rheb GTPase and is inhibited when phosphorylated by Akt (13Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig.. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Google Scholar). We found that LY294002 reduced purine synthesis to the same extent in tuberin-deficient cells as in sister cells containing Tsc2 (Fig. 2e). Tsc2-deficient cells are resistant to the effects of Akt on the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway and demonstrate constitutive S6 kinase activation (13Zhang H. Cicchetti G. Onda H. Koon H.B. Asrican K. Bajraszewski N. Vazquez F. Carpenter C.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig.. 2003; 112: 1223-1233Google Scholar). Second, we showed that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin only modestly reduced total purine synthesis in C2C12 cells and had no effect on the early or late steps of de novo purine synthesis (shown later in Fig. 4, a and b). Thus, Akt appeared to regulate purine synthesis independently of the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway. Effect of Akt Inhibition on PRPP Availability—Because ribose 5-phosphate and PRPP production can be limiting for purine synthesis (7Pilz R.B. Willis R.C. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 2927-2935Google Scholar, 30Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 2936-2941Google Scholar) and expression of a constitutively active Akt increases carbon flow through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (4Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Plas D.R. Hammerman P.S. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 7315-7328Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PI3K/Akt could regulate purine synthesis by regulating PRPP availability. We measured PRPP availability by incubating cells with [14C]adenine, which is converted to AMP by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, a reaction requiring PRPP (7Pilz R.B. Willis R.C. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1984; 259: 2927-2935Google Scholar). LY294002 decreased PRPP availability in C2C12 cells by 31%, whereas LY303511 had no effect (Fig. 3a). Serum starvation reduced PRPP availability albeit not to the extent it reduced purine synthesis, and replenishing cells with serum or insulin increased PRPP toward control levels (Fig. 3a). LY294002 further reduced PRPP availability under serum-starved conditions and largely prevented the effects of restoring serum or insulin (Fig. 3a). Treating cells with rapamycin had no significant effect on PRPP availability under any of the four conditions tested. These data suggest that some of the effects of Akt and serum on purine synthesis are from a decrease in PRPP availability. To investigate the basis for decreased PRPP availability in LY294002-treated C2C12 cells, we performed three separate experiments. First, we measured PRPP availability at several glucose concentrations and found a similar reduction in PRPP at each concentration (Fig. 3b). These data suggest that decreased PRPP in LY294002-treated cells was not from regulation of glucose transport because a more profound effect on PRPP availability would have been expected at lower glucose concentrations. Second, we measured carbon flow through the pentose phosphate pathway. We and others have shown that the non-oxidative branch of the pathway supplies most of the ribose 5-phosphate used in purine nucleotide synthesis (16Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1985; 260: 6054-6059Google Scholar, 17Raivio K.O. Lazar C.S. Krumholz H.R. Becker M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1981; 678: 51-57Google Scholar, 18Boros L.G. Puigjaner J. Cascante M. Lee W.N. Brandes J.L. Bassilian S. Yusuf F.I. Williams R.D. Muscarella P. Melvin W.S. Schirmer W.J. Cancer Res.. 1997; 57: 4242-4248Google Scholar, 19Boros L.G. Bassilian S. Lim S. Lee W.N. Pancreas.. 2001; 22: 1-7Google Scholar), and we found that LY294002 reduced carbon flow through this pathway by 39% (Fig. 3c). LY294002 had no effect on carbon flow through the oxidative branch of the pathway in HEL cells, whereas it inhibited purine synthesis to a similar extent in these cells as in C2C12 cells (Fig. 3d). The lack of an effect of LY294002 on carbon flow through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is further evidence that the effect of Akt on PRPP production was not from decreased glucose transport or glucose phosphorylation. Third, we measured the activity of PRPP synthetase, a multimeric enzyme whose activity is regulated by the intracellular phosphate concentration and PRPP synthetase-associated protein PAP 39 (31Becker M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol.. 2001; 69: 115-148Google Scholar). We found that PRPP synthetase activity was the same in control and LY294002-treated cells: 2.2 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.4 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively (mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments). Thus, reduced flow through the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway appeared to be the basis for reduced PRPP availability in Akt-inhibited cells. Effect of Akt Inhibition on Early and Late Steps of de Novo Purine Synthesis—The early steps of de novo purine synthesis can be measured by following [14C]formate incorporation into FGAR in the presence of 10 μm azaserine; at this concentration, azaserine inhibits formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (Fig. 1, reaction 4) but has minimal effect on other glutamine-requiring processes (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar, 25Henderson J.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 1962; 237: 2631-2635Google Scholar, 26Boss G.R. Biochem. J.. 1987; 242: 425-431Google Scholar). LY294002 decreased FGAR synthesis by ∼40% in C2C12 cells, whereas LY303511 and rapamycin had no significant effect (Fig. 4a). Because PRPP amidotransferase, which catalyzes the first committed step of the de novo pathway (Fig. 1, reaction 2), is inhibited by purine nucleotides, it seemed possible that Akt could inhibit FGAR synthesis by altering nucleotide levels. However, LY294002 had no effect on the intracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, or GMP when present for up to 9 h (supplemental Table S1; only the data at 3 h are shown, but similar results were seen at 6 and 9 h of LY294002 treatment). The intracellular concentrations of purine nucleotides did decrease after 15 h of LY24002 exposure at which time they fell by ∼50% (supplemental Fig. S2). Because LY294002 decreased FGAR synthesis to a similar extent as it reduced PRPP availability, these data suggest that Akt inhibits the early steps of purine synthesis by decreasing PRPP availability. The last two steps of de novo purine synthesis, which are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme ATIC (Fig. 1, reaction 5), can be measured by following [14C]formate incorporation into purine nucleotides in the presence of azaserine and AICA-riboside. Azaserine renders the assay dependent on exogenously supplied AICA-riboside, which is converted to AICAR by adenosine kinase. LY294002 inhibited AICAR-dependent purine synthesis in C2C12 cells by 50%, whereas LY303511 and rapamycin had no effect (Fig. 4b). To study the mechanism of the decrease in AICAR-dependent purine synthesis, we measured ATIC activity in cell extracts and observed a 20% decrease in enzyme activity in C2C12 cells that had been treated with LY294002: 3.71 ± 0.38 versus 2.94 ± 0.33 nmol/min/mg of protein in control and LY294002-treated cells, respectively (mean ± S.E. of five independent experiments; p = 0.0015 for the difference between control and LY294002-treated cells). Enzyme activity was unchanged in extracts of cells treated with LY303511, and adding LY294002 to either purified ATIC or cell extracts had no effect. In other experiments, expressing human ATIC in C2C12 cells increased rates of de novo purine synthesis, indicating that endogenous ATIC was limiting to purine synthesis; Sidi and Mitchell (32Sidi Y. Mitchell B.S. J. Clin. Investig.. 1985; 76: 2416-2419Google Scholar) reached a similar conclusion after finding increased AICAR (ZMP), and ZDP, and ZTP in erythrocytes from Lesch-Nyhan patients. Effect of Akt Inhibition on Adenine and Guanine Nucleotide Synthesis—IMP, the product of the de novo purine pathway, is converted to either AMP or GMP (Fig. 1). We found that LY294002 reduced adenylate synthesis by 50% and guanylate synthesis by 75%, whereas LY303511 had no effect on synthesis of either nucleotide (Fig. 5, a and b). Similar results were found for AICA-riboside-dependent AMP and GMP synthesis, eliminating the effects of Akt inhibition on PRPP availability and providing a more focused evaluation of AMP and GMP synthesis. We previously found preferential reduction in guanylate synthesis during other states of reduced purine nucleotide synthesis (14Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that under states of reduced IMP synthesis a shift to adenylates occurs, constituting a protective cellular mechanism to preserve ATP. Effect of Akt Inhibition on Salvage Purine Nucleotide Synthesis—To determine whether the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates purine nucleotide synthesis from the salvage pathway (Fig. 1, reaction 6), we measured [8-14C]hypoxanthine incorporation into purine nucleotides. This assay assesses the activity of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, the major enzyme of purine salvage. LY294002 reduced salvage synthesis by almost 50%, whereas LY303511 had no effect (Fig. 5c). The basis for the decrease in salvage pathway synthesis was likely from decreased PRPP availability because the salvage pathway requires this substrate, and the reduction in salvage synthesis was similar to the reduction in PRPP availability. We have found that the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates the synthesis of purine nucleotides via both the de novo and salvage pathways. Akt is known to positively regulate glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, and we now show that it regulates the synthesis of yet another major class of macromolecules. The regulation of purine synthesis by Akt is consistent with its positive effects on cell growth and proliferation, which require a concomitant increase in ATP and GTP production. We found that Akt regulates de novo purine synthesis at two separate steps: PRPP production and ATIC-catalyzed conversion of AICAR to IMP. This dual effect is analogous to Akt regulation of glucose metabolism and protein synthesis at several levels (1Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res.. 1999; 253: 210-229Google Scholar, 33Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J.. 1998; 335: 1-13Google Scholar). In addition to being required for purine synthesis, PRPP is required for pyrimidine and pyridine (NAD/NADP) synthesis. Thus, by regulating PRPP production, Akt can regulate multiple cellular processes, contributing to its role as a master cellular regulator (2Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell.. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Google Scholar). ATIC would seem an unlikely candidate for regulation because it is the last enzyme in the de novo pathway. However, because ATIC activity appears to be limiting to purine synthesis, small changes in enzyme activity could have profound effects on purine synthesis; thus, the 20% decrease in ATIC activity we found in Akt-inhibited cells could be the basis for the 50% decrease in AICAR-dependent purine synthesis. Moreover AICAR would be expected to accumulate in cells with decreased ATIC activity as occurs in patients with genetic ATIC deficiency (34Marie S. Heron B. Bitoun P. Timmerman T. Van Den Berghe G. Vincent M.F. Am. J. Hum. Genet.. 2004; 74: 1276-1281Google Scholar). AICAR is a potent activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (35Henin N. Vincent M.F. Gruber H.E. Van Den Berghe G. FASEB J.. 1995; 9: 541-546Google Scholar); the latter inhibits anabolic and activates catabolic pathways, decreasing protein, carbohydrate, and lipid synthesis and inhibiting cell growth and proliferation (35Henin N. Vincent M.F. Gruber H.E. Van Den Berghe G. FASEB J.. 1995; 9: 541-546Google Scholar, 36Hardie D.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2007; 8: 774-785Google Scholar). Thus, decreased Akt activation during growth factor deprivation could both directly (through decreased phosphorylation of Tsc2 and other substrates) and indirectly (through AMP-activated protein kinase activation) reduce macromolecule synthesis, and the two mechanisms could have a potentially synergistic effect. During catabolism of purine nucleotides, GMP is degraded to guanine, and AMP is degraded to hypoxanthine via inosine (Fig. 1). Guanine and hypoxanthine are converted to IMP by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Fig. 1, reaction 6), and in the presence of an adequate supply of these purine bases, cells derive purine nucleotides via this salvage pathway (37Hershfield M.S. Seegmiller J.E. J. Biol. Chem.. 1976; 251: 7348-7354Google Scholar). Because hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-mediated salvage activity was significantly reduced in Akt-inhibited cells, purine bases will be lost from the cell under states of low Akt activation. When combined with low rates of de novo purine synthesis, the cell will become depleted of purine nucleotides. Thus, the combination of a purine synthesis inhibitor, such as methotrexate, with a PI3K or Akt inhibitor could potentially be beneficial in treating cancer and other proliferative diseases requiring an abundant supply of purines. We measured PRPP availability using [14C]adenine because the Km of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase for PRPP is about 125 that of the Km of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase for PRPP (38Krenitsky T.A. Papaioannou R. Elion G.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 1969; 244: 1263-1270Google Scholar, 39Henderson J.F. Miller H.R. Kelley W.N. Rosenbloom F.M. Seegmiller J.E. Can. J. Biochem.. 1968; 46: 703-706Google Scholar). Thus, assessing adenine incorporation into purine nucleotides should be more sensitive to changes in the intracellular PRPP concentration than measuring hypoxanthine or guanine incorporation into nucleotides. Accurate assessment of the purine salvage pathway required measuring hypoxanthine incorporation into purine nucleotides because hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase is the major enzyme of purine salvage. In conclusion, the PI3K/Akt cassette regulates de novo and salvage purine nucleotide synthesis by regulating PRPP availability and ATIC activity. These newly discovered activities of the PI3K/Akt cassette can profoundly influence cellular metabolism and cell growth and proliferation. We thank J. R. Woodgett and D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2009011206,"Cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) involves fusion of viral and cellular membranes and is mediated by structural transitions in viral glycoprotein gp41. The antiviral C-peptide T20 targets the gp41 N-terminal heptad repeat region (N-HR), blocking gp41 conformational changes essential for the entry process. To probe the T20 structure-activity relationship, we engineered a molecular mimic of the entire gp41 N-HR coiled coil using the 5-Helix design strategy. T20 bound this artificial protein (denoted 5H-ex) with nanomolar affinity (K(D) = 30 nm), close to its IC50 concentration (approximately 3 nm) but much weaker than the affinity of a related inhibitory C-peptide C37 (K(D) = 0.0007 nm). T20/C37 competitive binding assays confirmed that T20 interacts with the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the N-HR coiled coil outside of a deep pocket region crucial for C37 binding. We used 5H-ex to investigate how the T20 N and C termini contributed to the inhibitor binding activity. Mutating three aromatic residues at the T20 C terminus (WNWF --> ANAA) had no effect on affinity, suggesting that these amino acids do not participate in T20 binding to the gp41 N-HR. The results support recent evidence pointing to a different role for these residues in T20 inhibition (Peisajovich, S. G., Gallo, S. A., Blumenthal, R., and Shai, Y. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 21012-21017; Liu, S., Jing, W., Cheung, B., Lu, H., Sun, J., Yan, X., Niu, J., Farmar, J., Wu, S., and Jiang, S. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9612-9620). By contrast, mutations near the T20 N terminus substantially influenced inhibitor binding strength. When Ile was substituted for Thr in the second T20 position, a 40-fold increase in binding affinity was measured (K(D) = 0.75 nm). The effect of this affinity enhancement on T20 inhibitory potency varied among different viral strains. The original T20 and the higher affinity T20 variant had similar potency against wild type HIV-1. However, the higher affinity T20 variant was significantly more potent against T20-resistant virus. The findings suggest that other factors in addition to binding affinity play a role in limiting T20 potency. As a mimetic of the complete gp41 N-HR coiled coil region, 5H-ex will be a useful tool to further elucidate mechanistic profiles of C-peptide inhibitors."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the esterification reaction between an amino acid and its cognate tRNA (1Schimmel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 1987; 56: 125-158Google Scholar, 2Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.. 2000; 64: 202-236Google Scholar). These enzymes are specific for both amino acid and tRNA substrates, ensuring the high fidelity required by translation. Mistakes caused by these synthetases can result in genetic code ambiguity and disruption of cellular functions (3Hendrickson T.L. de Crecy-Lagard V. Schimmel P. Annu. Rev.

Nature.. 2006; 443: 50-55Google Scholar). The aminoacylation of tRNA is a two-step reaction: (a) activation of amino acids with ATP by forming aminoacyl adenylates (AA-AMP) 3The abbreviations used are: AA-AMP, aminoacyl adenylate(s); LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase; IleRS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase; AaLeuRS, Aquifex aeolicus LeuRS; Nva, norvaline; WT, wild type. followed by (b) transfer of the aminoacyl residues from the aminoacyl adenylates to the cognate tRNA substrate (2Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev.. 2000; 64: 202-236Google Scholar). The accuracy of aminoacylation depends on both the specific recognition of amino acids during their activation (“coarse sieve”) and the editing that corrects errors at either the aminoacyl adenylate level (pretransfer editing) or the aminoacyl-tRNA level (post-transfer editing or “fine sieve”) (5Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry.. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Google Scholar). The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases can be divided into two classes of 10 enzymes on the basis of conserved sequences and characteristic structural motifs (6Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature.. 1990; 347: 203-206Google Scholar). Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), and valyl-tRNA synthetase belong to class Ia. LeuRS, IleRS, and valyl-tRNA synthetase develop a separated editing domain (also called the CP1 domain) that is appended to the aminoacylation active site to distinguish structurally similar Leu, Ile, and Val and to eliminate misacylated products (7Silvian L.F.

The mechanism of post-transfer editing is relatively clear. Based on structural and biochemical data, a model has been proposed wherein the flexible 3′-end of a misacylated tRNA is translocated from the aminoacylation active site to the hydrolytic editing site (8Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell.. 2000; 103: 793-803Google Scholar, 21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol.

In contrast, the mechanism of pretransfer editing is less well understood. Fluorescence-based assays and mutational analysis, together with x-ray crystallography studies showing that both pre- and post-transfer editing substrate analogs bind in overlapping sites in the CP1 domain of LeuRS and IleRS, have led to the proposal that misactivated amino acids are translocated from the catalytic site to the editing domain in a tRNA-dependent manner (8Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell.. 2000; 103: 793-803Google Scholar, 17Nomanbhoy T.K. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 519-528Google Scholar, 18Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2000; 97: 5119-5122Google Scholar, 19Bishop A.C. Beebe K. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 490-494Google Scholar). A “post-initiated pretransfer editing” model has been postulated for IleRS. In this model, an initial post-transfer editing step triggers a conformational change to an editing active conformation that can perform pretransfer editing in the CP1 domain (20Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 12989-12997Google Scholar). However, based on x-ray crystallography data, the aminoacylation and editing active sites are separated by ∼30 Å, and no confined passageway between active sites serving to prevent dissociation of AA-AMP from the surface of the enzyme during translocation is apparent. Thus, the mechanism of this translocation remains unclear. On the other hand, a recent study of class I glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, which normally lacks editing function and a spatially separate editing domain, has provided evidence for a tRNA-dependent pretransfer editing-like reaction occurring in the aminoacylation active site (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar). Another intriguing feature of pretransfer editing lies in the tRNA dependence of the reaction. It is well accepted that the pretransfer editing of IleRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase, and LeuRS is tRNA-dependent, consistent with the hypothesis that tRNA plays a role in the translocation of AA-AMP from the catalytic site to the editing domain. However, a recent study has revealed that, although it carries an extra editing domain, the class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzes Ala-AMP hydrolysis predominantly into the synthetic active site in a tRNA-independent way, whereas the “selective release” of the noncognate adenylate from the active site into solution constitutes only a minor pathway (22Splan K.E. Ignatov M.E. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 7128-7134Google Scholar). The recently designed experiments based on TLC analysis (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar) led us to further investigate the pretransfer editing function of class I LeuRS, with emphasis on tRNA independence and the synthetic catalytic site. LeuRSs from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (AaLeuRS) was used in the study. In addition, the editing properties of post-transfer editing-deficient mutants of AaLeuRS were also studied. Preparation of Enzymes and RNA Substrates—AaLeuRS and its mutant D373A were overproduced in Escherichia coli as His-tagged proteins and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography, as previously described (24Zhao M.W. Zhu B. Hao R. Xu M.G. Eriani G. Wang E.D. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Google Scholar). AatRNALeu was purified from an E. coli overproduction strain (25Xu M.G. Chen J.F. Martin F. Zhao M.W. Eriani G. Wang E.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 41590-41596Google Scholar, 26Zhu B. Zhao M.W Eriani G. Wang E.D. RNA.. 2007; 13: 15-21Google Scholar); the tRNA charging level was 1400 pmol/A260. Ile-AatRNALeu was prepared using AaLeuRS D373A. ATP/PPi Exchange, tRNA Charging, and Deacylation—The ATP-PPi exchange (60 °C) and isoleucylation (37 °C) assays of AaLeuRS were performed as previously described (24Zhao M.W. Zhu B. Hao R. Xu M.G. Eriani G. Wang E.D. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Google Scholar). ATP-PPi exchange kinetics of enzymes were determined in the presence of 0.02–0.2 mm Leu and 0.25–64 mm Nva, Ile, or Met. The hydrolytic editing assays of AaLeuRS were performed at 37 °C (24Zhao M.W. Zhu B. Hao R. Xu M.G. Eriani G. Wang E.D. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 1430-1439Google Scholar). ATP Consumption—Assays for AaLeuRSs were carried out in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (20–30 cpm/pmol), 15 mm amino acids, and 1 μm LeuRS with or without 5 μm cognate tRNALeu at 60 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) of the editing reaction mixture were removed at appropriate time intervals and quenched in 350 μl of a mixture containing 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 7% HClO4, and 6% activated charcoal. After centrifugation, the amount of inorganic phosphate 32P in 50 μl of supernatant was quantified by scintillation counting. The background rate in the ATP consumption assay in the absence of amino acid was subtracted. AMP Formation—For AaLeuRS, AMP formation was measured in reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 30 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 units/ml pyrophosphatase, 3 mm ATP, 20 nm [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 15 mm Leu or 15 mm Nva or 30 mm Ile, with or without 5 μm AatRNALeu. Reactions were incubated at 60 °C and initiated by the addition of 1 μm AaLeuRS or its D373A mutant. Aliquots (1.5 μl) were quenched in 6 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). Quenched aliquots (1.0 μl each) were spotted in duplicate on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates (Merck) prewashed with water. Separation of AA-[32P]AMP, [32P]AMP, and [32P]ATP was performed by developing TLC plates in 0.1 m ammonium acetate and 5% acetic acid (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar, 22Splan K.E. Ignatov M.E. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 7128-7134Google Scholar). The plates were visualized by phosphorimaging, and data were analyzed using ImageQuant version 5.2 software (GE Healthcare). The positions corresponding to the elution of free AMP were confirmed by using commercially available AMP (Sigma), and the positions corresponding to AA-AMP were as previously described (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar, 22Splan K.E. Ignatov M.E. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 7128-7134Google Scholar). Data were corrected for a small background rate of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of AaLeuRS (Fig. S1). The gray densities of [32P]AMP and AA-[32P]AMP spots were compared with the gray density of a known [32P]ATP concentration. Rate constants were obtained from graphs of AA-[32P]AMP and [32P]AMP formation plotted against time. Because Leu-AMP is the cognate product, its binding to LeuRS is very tight, and we could not detect it by the TLC procedure described above without using a modified quenching buffer containing 0.5% SDS, 250 mm ATP, 25 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaAc, pH 4.7. Under these denaturing conditions, the released Leu-AMP could be detected (Fig. S2). Nonenzymatic Hydrolysis of Adenylates—The rate of nonenzymatic hydrolysis of adenylate was measured by a chase experiment wherein a large excess of unlabeled ATP was added to the reaction mixtures following the initiation of Nva-AMP synthesis (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar). The excess of unlabeled ATP induces the release of the noncognate aminoacyl-adenylate from the active site into solution, where its spontaneous hydrolysis is monitored on TLC plates. A solution of 1 μm AaLeuRS was first incubated with 15 mm Nva, 100 μm ATP, and 0.25 μm [α-32P]ATP for 12 min at 60 °C to prepare Nva-[32P]AMP. Then unlabeled ATP (120 mm, equal to a 1200-fold molar excess of unlabeled ATP) was added, and the hydrolysis activity was quenched at various time points (0.5–10 min) by mixing 2 μl of the reaction mixture with 6 μl of 200 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1% SDS. Separation of Nva-[32P]AMP and [32P]AMP by TLC was then performed, and reactions were quantified as described above. The rate constants for the nonenzymatic hydrolysis reactions were obtained by plotting the concentration of Nva-[32P]AMP against time and fitting the data to a first-order decay curve. AaLeuRS Misactivates and Edits Norvaline—In cognate aminoacylation, the formation of one aminoacyl-tRNA molecule leads to the transient synthesis of one aminoacyl-adenylate molecule and the consumption of a single ATP molecule. However, when a noncognate amino acid is activated and then hydrolyzed at the aminoacyl-adenylate or later aminoacyl-tRNA level, one molecule of ATP is wasted (27Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1974; 71: 4135-4139Google Scholar, 28Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Google Scholar). Therefore, the extra consumption of ATP during enzyme catalysis is characteristic of editing events. In this study, we measured and compared ATP consumption of the bacterial AaLeuRS for Leu and its analogs Nva, Ile, and Met. These amino acids triggered ATP consumption at different levels in the order Nva ≫ Met > Ile > Leu in the presence of tRNALeu. In the absence of tRNA, the order was Nva ≫ Ile > Met > Leu, and the consumption was clearly lower (Fig. 1). As expected, AaLeuRS consumed negligible ATP in the presence of Leu, the cognate substrate, because there was no waste of ATP due to editing. Nva triggered the strongest ATP consumption, suggesting a very active editing process. In the absence of tRNA, ATP consumption was reduced but not abolished, suggesting the existence of a tRNA-independent editing mechanism in addition to tRNA-dependent editing. In addition, we measured Nva activation by the ATP-PPi exchange assay and compared it with the other amino acids. Compared with leucine, Nva was efficiently activated. The values of kcat decreased by half, and Km increased 35-fold for Nva, which indicated that the enzyme needed more substrate to reach half-saturation; the global effect corresponded to a 70-fold loss in catalytic efficiency (Table 1). AaLeuRS also activated Ile and Met but with a 40–50-fold lower efficiency than it did with Nva (Table 1). Taken together, these results showed a strong correlation between amino acid activation efficiency and ATP consumption levels. Nva, the most efficiently activated analog, consumed the largest amount of ATP. A significant level of ATP consumption was also measured in the absence of tRNA, indicating that proofreading occurs at the aminoacyl-adenylate level independently of the presence of tRNA.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of AaLeuRS in amino acid activation reaction at 60 °CAmino acidKmkcatkcat/Kmkcat/Km (relative)μms-1s-1 μm-1Leu2.8 ± 0.426.3 ± 3.39.41Nva96 ± 1212.6 ± 1.40.131.4 × 10-2Ile698 ± 1091.9 ± 0.32.7 × 10-32.9 × 10-4Met983 ± 1393.2 ± 0.43.3 × 10-33.5 × 10-4 Open table in a new tab AaLeuRS Possesses an Efficient tRNA-dependent Editing Pathway—In the previous assay, we showed that AaLeuRS activated the noncognate amino acids Nva, Ile, and Met and consumed an extra amount of ATP to probably edit these noncognate products. We applied a TLC-based assay to simultaneously follow [32P]AMP and aminoacyl-[32P]adenylate formation in the presence of noncognate amino acids and tRNA. The same assay was performed without tRNA in order to investigate the tRNA-independent editing step. Our data showed that Nva stimulated much more [32P]AMP formation than Ile or Leu, in accordance with the ATP consumption results. Control reactions showed that there was very little AMP formation in the absence of enzyme or amino acid (Fig. S1). In the presence of tRNA, the rate of AMP formation in the presence of 15 mm Nva was 18-fold (kobs ratio 1.5:0.082) greater than the rate of AMP formation in the presence of 30 mm Ile and 44-fold (kobs ratio 1.5:0.034) greater than that in the presence of 15 mm Leu (Table 2, Fig. 2, and Fig. S3). A significant amount of Nva-[32P]AMP was also detected, but its formation rate was only 1500 (kobs ratio 0.0031:1.5) of the rate of [32P]AMP formation.TABLE 2Steady-state rate constants of AaLeuRS and its D373A mutant in AMP and AA-AMP synthesis at 60 °CLeuRSAmino acidtRNAAMP formation kobsAA-AMP formation kobss-1s-1WTLeu+(3.4 ± 0.6) × 10-2NDaND, not detected.WTLeu-(6.8 ± 0.1) × 10-3NDWTIle+(8.2 ± 0.1) × 10-2NDWTIle-(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10-2NDWTNva+1.5 ± 0.2(3.1 ± 0.3) × 10-3WTNva-(9.8 ± 1.5) × 10-2(6.6 ± 0.8) × 10-3D373ANva+(2.9 ± 0.3) × 10-1(5.0 ± 0.6) × 10-3D373ANva-(9.8 ± 1.3) × 10-2(6.3 ± 0.9) × 10-3a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab An Additional Minor tRNA-independent Editing Pathway to Edit Norvaline—In the absence of tRNA, the AMP formation was considerably reduced (Table 2, Fig. 2, and Figs. S2 and S3). The rate of AMP formation in the presence of 15 mm Nva was only 115 times (kobs ratio 0.098:1.5) the corresponding rate in the presence of tRNA, whereas those in the presence of Leu and Ile were very close to the background level (Table 2, Fig. 2, and Fig. S3). Therefore, these data suggested that tRNA-dependent editing was the main pathway used by AaLeuRS to clear the misactivated compounds. However, the data also showed the existence of an additional process, weaker in efficiency, which did not depend on the tRNA. In addition, the data showed that in the absence of tRNA, the rate of Nva-[32P]AMP formation was increased 2-fold, and its concentration exceeded the enzyme concentration when the reaction was carried out for 12 min (Table 2 and Fig. 2). This might indicate that a fraction of this compound was released into solution instead of being edited on the enzyme by a tRNA-independent process. Once released into solution, Nva-[32P]AMP might undergo noncatalytic hydrolysis. In order to measure the rate of this later reaction, we performed a cold chase experiment. The rate of Nva-[32P]AMP hydrolysis was insensitive to the concentration of ATP in this concentration range and yielded a kobs of 0.0004 s–1 (Fig. 3), 245-fold lower than the kobs determined for AMP formation (0.098 s–1 in Table 2), which takes into account both catalytic and noncatalytic AMP formation (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This showed that the rate of hydrolysis of Nva-[32P]AMP after its release into solution was negligible compared with the total hydrolysis rate measured in the presence of Nva. Thus, the rate of AMP formation was not driven by nonenzymatic adenylate hydrolysis but by another faster step. tRNA-independent Editing Does Not Occur in the CP1 Editing Domain—To explore the role of the CP1 domain in the tRNA-independent editing of AaLeuRS, we inactivated the CP1 domain by mutating a conserved aspartic acid of AaLeuRS to alanine (D373A). This residue has been shown to be crucial for maintaining the proper orientation of both pre- and post-transfer editing substrates into the CP1 domain (29Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 951-963Google Scholar), and its mutation in E. coli and yeast LeuRS abolishes the editing activity (30Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res.. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Google Scholar). When introduced into AaLeuRS, the D373A mutation abolished the post-transfer editing of the mischarged Ile-tRNALeu (Fig. 4). The D373A mutation also reduced to ⅕ (kobs ratio 0.29:1.5) the rate of AMP formation measured in the presence of Nva in the TLC assay (Figs. 1 and 4 and Table 2). This was expected, according to the loss of post-transfer editing monitored in the deacylation assay. However, the kobs value of the mutant for AMP formation with tRNA was 3-fold (kobs ratio 0.29:0.098) higher than that of the native enzyme monitored without tRNA (Table 2). This showed that a mutant exhibiting an inactive CP1 domain, in the presence of tRNA, consumed more ATP than the native LeuRS in the absence of tRNA. If we assume that the CP1 domain was completely inactivated, this would mean that tRNALeu was also involved in an editing process not located in the CP1 domain. The kobs of the AaLeuRS-D373A mutant with tRNA in Nva-[32P]AMP formation was 0.005 s–1 and increased slightly more than that of the native AaLeuRS (0.0031 s–1) (Fig. 5 and Table 2). This indicated that in the absence of efficient post-transfer editing and with a constant synthesis rate, there was an increase in the steady-state rate formation of Nva-[32P]AMP. As a consequence, the accumulation of noncognate adenylates by mutant D373A induced a weak but significant mischarging of tRNALeu, as shown in the aminoacylation assay (Fig. 4). This also indicated that the remaining editing activity was not dependent on the CP1 domain and was not sufficient to prevent the misaminoacylation of tRNALeu. More interestingly, in the absence of tRNA, when only the tRNA-independent editing was monitored, the AMP formation was identical to that measured with the native AaLeuRS (both kobs 0.098 s–1 in Table 2). Thus, the tRNA-independent editing activity was not affected by the D373A mutation, suggesting that this activity was not confined to the CP1 domain but resides most probably at the synthetic site, as observed for other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (15Gruic-Sovulj I. Rokov-Plavec J. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett.. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Google Scholar, 21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar, 22Splan K.E. Ignatov M.E. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2008; 283: 7128-7134Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 and Table 2). For the AaLeuRS D373A mutant, the AMP formation activity in the absence of tRNA was equal to that of the wild-type LeuRS (kobs = 0.098 s–1) corresponding to 7% (0.098/1.5) of the total editing activity of the native enzyme in the presence of tRNA, however, 93% of AMP formation resulted from a tRNA-dependent reaction (Table 2 and Fig. 6). Although it showed no detectable post-transfer editing activity (Fig. 3), mutant D373A in the presence of tRNA displayed an additional 12.8% (0.29–0.098/1.5) AMP formation activity as compared with the assay without tRNA (Table 2). This suggested that tRNALeu might be involved in an editing process not located in the CP1 domain or, alternatively, that the D373A mutation did not totally inactivate the CP1 editing site. Norvaline Editing May Be Essential for Maintaining Translation Fidelity—A number of previous studies of the LeuRS editing function have used Ile as a noncognate amino acid substrate. Here, we showed that AaLeuRS activated Ile with a rate 3500-fold lower than that of the cognate Leu. Such a low misactivation rate is comparable with the general error level in protein synthesis, 1:3000 (31Loftfield R.B. Vanderjagt D. Biochem. J.. 1972; 128: 1353-1356Google Scholar), suggesting that the proofreading of Ile-tRNALeu is not critical for the cell. In contrast, we showed here that Nva was activated by AaLeuRS with an efficiency only 70-fold lower than that of Leu. Since Nva differs from Leu by a single methyl group, its smaller size and structural similarity with Leu make it less distinguishable by the coarse sieve of the synthetic site of LeuRS (5Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry.. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Google Scholar). Nva is naturally found in vivo. Norvaline has been reported in an antifungal peptide produced by Bacillus subtilis (32Nandi S. Sen G.P. Nature.. 1953; 172: 871-872Google Scholar) and as an Ile fermentation product (33Kisumi M. Sugiura M. Chibata I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo).. 1976; 80: 333-339Google Scholar). Nva has also been reported to be a potential by-product of the Leu biosynthetic pathway in E. coli (23Apostol I. Levine J. Lippincott J. Leach J. Hess E. Glascock C.B. Weickert M.J. Blackmore R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 28980-28988Google Scholar). Since there is no clear mechanism to utilize Nva, it accumulates, and the ratio of free Nva/Leu rises. This leads to increasing mischarge of leucine-specific tRNAs with Nva, resulting in some conditions in the detectable incorporation of Nva into proteins (23Apostol I. Levine J. Lippincott J. Leach J. Hess E. Glascock C.B. Weickert M.J. Blackmore R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 28980-28988Google Scholar). Such a high misactivation rate of Nva by LeuRS may threaten the fidelity of translation, and we hypothesize that the enzyme may have evolved some editing mechanism against Nva. Post-transfer Editing Is the Major Pathway for Nva Editing—To investigate the editing reactions of AaLeuRS, we performed two experiments. (a) First, we monitored AMP and Nva-AMP formation in the presence or absence of tRNA in order to separate the contribution of the tRNA-dependent editing from tRNA-independent editing. Because 93% of AMP formation resulted from a tRNA-dependent reaction and only 7% from a tRNA-independent reaction, AaLeuRS preferentially uses the fine sieve of the post-transfer editing reaction as valyl-tRNA synthetase, another class Ia synthetase (34Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Google Scholar, 35Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry.. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Google Scholar), and in contrast to E. coli IleRS, which proceeds 70–90% through the pretransfer editing pathway (28Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Google Scholar). (b) Second, we repeated the same experiment on a LeuRS mutant carrying an inactive CP1 domain in order to measure the contribution of the CP1 domain to the formation of AMP. To inactivate the CP1 domain, residue Asp-373 was mutated to Ala in order to mimic the corresponding E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae LeuRS mutants that are deficient in editing (29Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 951-963Google Scholar). According to the x-ray structure of TtLeuRS, this conserved acidic residue has been shown to interact with both post-transfer and pretransfer analogs (29Lincecum Jr., T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grøtli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell.. 2003; 11: 951-963Google Scholar). Our results clearly showed that the tRNA-independent editing activity was not decreased by the D373A mutation, suggesting that this activity was not confined to the CP1 domain but resided most likely at the synthetic site, as observed for other editing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases lacking separated editing domains (15Gruic-Sovulj I. Rokov-Plavec J. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett.. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Google Scholar, 21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar). Kinetic Proofreading and Pretransfer Editing to Achieve LeuRS Specificity—The TLC assay revealed significant Nva-AMP accumulation when the editing reaction was hampered by the absence of tRNA or when the inactivated D373A mutant was used. Under those conditions, Nva-AMP formed and accumulated if the pretransfer editing activity was not efficient enough to clear the noncognate adenylate molecules. In addition to post-transfer editing (Fig. 7, route 4) (34Eldred E.W. Schimmel P.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1972; 247: 2961-2964Google Scholar, 36Yarus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1972; 69: 1915-1919Google Scholar), hydrolytic editing of errors of misactivation of amino acids can take place by three other routes, as shown in Fig. 7: (a) via route 1, the dissociation of the complex to give the free aminoacyl adenylate complex, which hydrolyzes in solution (“kinetic proofreading”) (27Hopfield J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1974; 71: 4135-4139Google Scholar) or (b) via routes 2 and 3, the hydrolysis of aminoacyl-adenylate when bound to the enzyme. We have evidence from this study that these pathways could be used to some extent. With regard to kinetic proofreading (route 1), it has been pointed out previously that the rate constant for the dissociation of the cognate aminoacyl-adenylate from its enzyme is in general low, and consequently, only very dissimilar noncognate complexes should dissociate sufficiently rapidly to compete significantly with transfer (37Mulvey R.S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1977; 16: 4731-4737Google Scholar). Here, we showed that by a tRNA-independent process, AMP was formed with a kobs of 0.098 s–1. The dissociation and accumulation (or formation) of Nva-AMP into the reaction mixture was also observed with a kobs of 0.0066 s–1 (Table 2). In contrast, under the same conditions, the release of Leu-AMP was not observed after the cognate activation reaction, suggesting that the stability of the cognate adenylate on the enzyme was much higher than that of Nva-AMP. To observe Leu-AMP release, protein-denaturing conditions were required, confirming that the cognate adenylate is tightly bound. These observations showed that preferential or selective dissociation occurred with Nva-AMP compared with Leu-AMP. However, this phenomenon cannot contribute significantly to the global AMP formation, since our data indicate that Nva-AMP accumulation rate was low despite good stability of Nva-AMP in solution, the spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis rates being 0.0004 s–1 at 60 °C and 0.0001 s–1 at 30 °C, much lower that the tRNA-independent AMP formation rate (0.098 and 0.14 s–1 for AaLeuRS). These data strongly suggested that the nonenzymatic degradation of noncognate adenylates did not play a significant role in the global editing reaction. This also indicated that there is another rate-determining step in the pretransfer tRNA-independent editing mechanism. The rate-determining step might be, for example, another editing step catalyzed by the enzyme at the pretransfer level (e.g. route 2). Such editing reactions have recently been described for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and seryl-tRNA synthetase (15Gruic-Sovulj I. Rokov-Plavec J. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett.. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Google Scholar, 21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar). Although conceptually described in the 1960s (38Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem.. 1966; 241: 839-845Google Scholar), the enzyme-catalyzed pretransfer editing (route 2) has proven to be more difficult to elucidate, essentially because of the inability to directly assess its pathway. Evidence in favor of pretransfer editing was obtained by detailed kinetic investigations performed on IleRS (28Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Google Scholar). Pretransfer editing includes several mechanisms that remove the adenylate before the aminoacylation catalysis, as shown in Fig. 7. It can occur at the synthetic site in the absence of tRNA (Fig. 7, route 2) or in the presence of cognate tRNA (Fig. 7, route 3) (28Fersht A.R. Biochemistry.. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Google Scholar) and, alternatively, at a distinct hydrolytic site, such as the CP1 editing site. In that case, the noncognate adenylate has to be transferred to the editing site in a tRNA-dependent manner, and this would require a complex mechanism (19Bishop A.C. Beebe K. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 490-494Google Scholar, 20Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. Biochemistry.. 2003; 42: 12989-12997Google Scholar) and structural rearrangements (39Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 10: 915-922Google Scholar). As suggested before, the rate-determining step for the 12.8% residual AMP formation activity observed with the D373A mutant might also be the rate of a tRNA-dependent pretransfer editing reaction. Although we did not demonstrate its existence, we cannot exclude the existence of such activity in AaLeuRS. Such hydrolytic activity, occurring at the synthetic site, was proposed for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar) and seryl-tRNA synthetase (15Gruic-Sovulj I. Rokov-Plavec J. Weygand-Durasevic I. FEBS Lett.. 2007; 581: 5110-5114Google Scholar), two other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases lacking editing sites. In summary, our findings suggested that AaLeuRS follows the “double sieve” theory for rejection of noncognate amino acids (5Fersht A.R. Dingwall C. Biochemistry.. 1979; 18: 2627-2631Google Scholar). The coarse sieve mechanism rejects most of the noncognate amino acids during the activation step. As a consequence, Ile and Met are poorly activated, whereas Nva escapes partially to this sieve. The second sieve, or fine sieve, includes the post-transfer editing activity, which is the major editing pathway, and one additional minor pretransfer editing activity, which does not depend on tRNA. It has been suggested that pretransfer editing activities that still persist in contemporary enzymes are remnants of the initial editing activity. They were operating as crude filters to generate only a small increase in the overall fidelity (21Gruic-Sovulj I. Uter N. Bullock T. Perona J.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 23978-23986Google Scholar). During evolution, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have improved the proofreading mechanism by adding a more sophisticated post-transfer editing mechanism. At the same time, they have evolved separate editing domains. For AaLeuRS, further investigations to locate the exact active site for the tRNA-dependent pretransfer editing pathway are currently under way by constructing and analyzing more editing-deficient mutants.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, is found in all organisms, and five different classes of these enzymes have been identified. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli has two class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphatases, GlpX and YggF, which show different catalytic properties. We present the first crystal structure of a class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (GlpX) determined in a free state and in the complex with a substrate (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate) or inhibitor (phosphate). The crystal structure of the ligand-free GlpX revealed a compact, globular shape with two α/β-sandwich domains. The core fold of GlpX is structurally similar to that of Li+-sensitive phosphatases implying that they have a common evolutionary origin and catalytic mechanism. The structure of the GlpX complex with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate revealed that the active site is located between two domains and accommodates several conserved residues coordinating two metal ions and the substrate. The third metal ion is bound to phosphate 6 of the substrate. Inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited activity of both GlpX and YggF, and the crystal structure of the GlpX complex with phosphate demonstrated that the inhibitor molecule binds to the active site. Alanine replacement mutagenesis of GlpX identified 12 conserved residues important for activity and suggested that Thr90 is the primary catalytic residue.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase, 2The abbreviations used are: FBPase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; IMPase, inositol monophosphatase; PAPase, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphatase; PIPase, enzyme acting on both inositol-1,4-bisphosphate and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank. EC 3.1.3.11), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to form fructose 6-phosphate and orthophosphate. It is the reverse of the reaction catalyzed by phosphofructokinase in glycolysis, and the product, fructose 6-phosphate, is an important precursor in various biosynthetic pathways (1Horecker B.L. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol.. 1975; 42: 193-226Google Scholar). In all organisms, gluconeogenesis is an important metabolic pathway that allows the cells to synthesize glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors, such as organic acids, amino acids, and glycerol. FBPases are members of the large superfamily of lithium-sensitive phosphatases, which includes three families of inositol phosphatases and FBPases (the phosphoesterase clan CL0171, 3167 sequences, Pfam data base). These enzymes show metal-dependent and lithium-sensitive phosphomonoesterase activity and include inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases, inositol monophosphatases (IMPases), 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphatases (PAPases), and enzymes acting on both inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and PAP (PIPases) (2York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Google Scholar). They possess a common structural core with the active site lying between α+β and α/β domains (3Patel S. Martinez-Ripoll M. Blundell T.L. Albert A. J. Mol. Biol.. 2002; 320: 1087-1094Google Scholar). Li+-sensitive phosphatases are putative targets for lithium therapy in the treatment of manic depressive patients (4Nahorski S.R. Ragan C.I. Challiss R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci.. 1991; 12: 297-303Google Scholar), whereas FBPases are targets for the development of drugs for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (5Wright S.W. Carlo A.A. Carty M.D. Danley D.E. Hageman D.L. Karam G.A. Levy C.B. Mansour M.N. Mathiowetz A.M. McClure L.D. Nestor N.B. McPherson R.K. Pandit J. Pustilnik L.R. Schulte G.K. Soeller W.C. Treadway J.L. Wang I.K. Bauer P.H. J. Med.

In addition, FBPase is required for virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania major and plays an important role in the production of lysine and glutamate by Corynebacterium glutamicum (7Naderer T. Ellis M.A. Sernee M.F. De Souza D.P. Curtis J. Handman E. McConville M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2006; 103: 5502-5507Google Scholar, 8Becker J. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Heinzle E. Wittmann C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.. 2005; 71: 8587-8596Google Scholar). Presently, five different classes of FBPases have been proposed based on their amino acid sequences (FBPases I to V) (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar, 10Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Structure (Lond.).. 2004; 12: 949-959Google Scholar, 11Hines J.K. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Google Scholar). Eukaryotes contain only the FBPase I-type enzyme, but all five types exist in various prokaryotes. Types I, II, and III are primarily in bacteria, type IV in archaea (a bifunctional FBPase/inositol monophosphatase), and type V in thermophilic prokaryotes from both domains (11Hines J.K. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Google Scholar). Many organisms have more than one FBPase, mostly the combination of types I + II or II + III, but no bacterial genome has a combination of types I and III FBPases (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). The type I FBPase is the most widely distributed among living organisms and is the primary FBPase in Escherichia coli, most bacteria, a few archaea, and all eukaryotes (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L.

Three-dimensional structures of the type I (from pig kidney, spinach chloroplasts, and E. coli), type IV (MJ0109 and AF2372), and type V (ST0318) FBPases have been solved (10Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S.

Xue Y. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry.. 1995; 34: 4299-4306Google Scholar). FBPases I and IV and inositol monophosphatases share a common sugar phosphatase fold organized in five layered interleaved α-helices and β-sheets (α-β-α-β-α) (2York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W.

Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry.. 2000; 39: 8565-8574Google Scholar). ST0318 (an FBPase V enzyme) is composed of one domain with a completely different four-layer α-β-β-α fold (10Nishimasu H. Fushinobu S. Shoun H. Wakagi T. Structure (Lond.).. 2004; 12: 949-959Google Scholar). The FBPases from these three classes (I, IV, and V) require divalent cations for activity (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+), and their structures have revealed the presence of three or four metal ions in the active site. E. coli has five Li+-sensitive phosphatases as follows: CysQ (a PAPase), SuhB (an IMPase), Fbp (a FBPase I enzyme), GlpX (a FBPase II), and YggF (an uncharacterized protein) (see the Pfam data base). CysQ is a 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphatase involved in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway (25Neuwald A.F. Krishnan B.R. Brikun I. Kulakauskas S. Suziedelis K. Tomcsanyi T. Leyh T.S. Berg D.E. J.

Microbiol.. 2007; 73: 5447-5452Google Scholar), whereas SuhB is an inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) that is also known as a suppressor of temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes in E. coli (27Matsuhisa A. Suzuki N. Noda T. Shiba K. J. Bacteriol.. 1995; 177: 200-205Google Scholar, 28Wang Y. Stieglitz K.A. Bubunenko M. Court D.L. Stec B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 26989-26996Google Scholar). Fbp is required for growth on gluconeogenic substrates and probably represents the main gluconeogenic FBPase (12Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol.. 1965; 90: 837-842Google Scholar). This enzyme has been characterized both biochemically and structurally and shown to be inhibited by low concentrations of AMP (IC50 15 μm) (11Hines J.K. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Google Scholar, 29Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys.. 1983; 225: 944-949Google Scholar, 30Kelley-Loughnane N. Biolsi S.A.

The E. coli GlpX, a class II enzyme FBPase, has been shown to possess a Mn2+-dependent FBPase activity (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). The increased expression of glpX from a multicopy plasmid complemented the Fbp- phenotype; however, the glpX knock-out strain grew normally on gluconeogenic substrates (succinate or glycerol) (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). In this study, we present the first structure of a class II FBPase, the E. coli GlpX, in a free state and in the complex with FBP + metals or phosphate. We have demonstrated that the fold of GlpX is similar to that of the lithium-sensitive phosphatases. We have identified the GlpX residues important for activity and proposed a catalytic mechanism. We have also showed that YggF is a third FBPase in E. coli, which has distinct catalytic properties and is more sensitive than GlpX to the inhibition by lithium or phosphate. Gene Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of GlpX and YggF—The GlpX open reading frame was PCR-amplified using chromosomal DNA of the E. coli DH5α strain and the cloning primers containing the restriction sites for BamHI and NdeI and was cloned into the modified pET15b vector (Novagen) in which the tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site, and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site (31Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure (Lond.).. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Google Scholar). The overexpression plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold strain (Stratagene). The YggF overexpressing plasmid was obtained from the Genobase collection (32Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res.. 2005; 12: 291-299Google Scholar). GlpX and YggF were overexpressed in E. coli and purified using metal-chelate affinity chromatography on nickel affinity resin (Qiagen) with a high yield (>50 mg/liter culture) and homogeneity (>95%) as described previously (31Zhang R.G. Skarina T. Katz J.E. Beasley S. Khachatryan A. Vyas S. Arrowsmith C.H. Clarke S. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. Structure (Lond.).. 2001; 9: 1095-1106Google Scholar). Purified proteins were concentrated using a centrifugal membrane concentrator (Millipore), frozen as drops in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Gel filtration analysis of the oligomeric state of GlpX and YggF was performed with a Superdex-75 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES-K (pH 7.5) and 0.2 m NaCl using AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated with ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Enzymatic Assays—Phosphatase activity against fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or other substrates (glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, all from Sigma) was measured spectrophotometrically using the Malachite Green reagent (33Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1988; 171: 266-270Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (34Proudfoot M. Kuznetsova E. Brown G. Rao N.N. Kitagawa M. Mori H. Savchenko A. Yakunin A.F. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 54687-54694Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.16 or 0.8 ml) contained 50 mm CHES-K buffer (pH 9.0), 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and 0.07–0.2 μg of enzyme. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of Malachite Green reagent (0.04 or 0.2 ml) (33Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem.. 1988; 171: 266-270Google Scholar), and the production of Pi was measured at 630 nm. For determination of the Km and Vmax, the assays contained substrates at concentrations of 0.02–0.5 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear curve fitting from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The effect of inorganic phosphate on FBPase activity of GlpX and YggF was measured using the continuous assay with phosphoglucoisomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of GlpX—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amino acids selected to be mutated were all changed to alanine. DNA encoding wild-type GlpX cloned into the modified pET15b was used as a template for mutagenesis. The standard PCR mixture contained 50–100 ng of template DNA and 150–250 ng of each mutagenizing primer. The methylated plasmid was digested with DpnI, and 4 μl of each reaction were used to transform competent DH5α cells. Plasmid was purified from the resulting ampicillin-resistant colonies using the QIAprep Spin mini prep kit (Qiagen), and all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Verified plasmids containing the desired mutations were transformed into the E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain, and the mutant GlpX proteins were overexpressed and purified in the same manner as the wild-type GlpX. Protein Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of GlpX were grown at 21 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 2 μl of protein sample mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir buffer as described previously (35Kimber M.S.

The crystals of the wild-type GlpX grew after 1–2 weeks in the presence of 7% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.4). The crystals of the GlpX D61A complex with fructose 1,6-bisphosphate were obtained by crystallization in the presence of 28% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.2 m CaCl2, 0.1 m HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), and 10 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, whereas the complex of the GlpX D61A with phosphate was crystallized in 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m NH4 acetate, and 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.6). For diffraction studies, the crystals were stabilized with the crystallization buffer supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Diffraction data for native crystals of apo-GlpX in space group P422 (PDB code 3bih), GlpX D61A plus phosphate (PDB code 3big), and GlpX D61A plus FBP (PDB code 3d1r) were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku Micromax-007 rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic confocal “blue” optics, and diffraction intensities were recorded on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate system (Table 2). The resulting diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar), and the structures were solved using molecular replacement using the protein atoms from the first GlpX structure (PDB code 1ni9). Molecular replacement was performed using MOLREP (41Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

E. coli Has Two Genes Encoding the Type II (GlpX-like) FBPases—In the E. coli genome, the glpX gene forms an operon (glpFKX) with glpF (a glycerol transport facilitator) and glpK (a glycerol kinase). This operon is one of five operons of the glp regulon involved in the growth of E. coli on glycerol (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). A BLAST analysis of the E. coli genome using the GlpX sequence (336 amino acids) as a query identified the uncharacterized protein YggF (321 amino acids), which shares 58% sequence identity with GlpX. The yggF gene is part of a large operon (cmtBA and yggPFDC), which encodes a mannitol phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent transferase (CmtB and CmtA), a predicted dehydrogenase (YggP), a predicted transcriptional regulator (YggD), and a putative kinase (YggC). The role of YggF in E. coli is unknown, although GlpX is likely to be involved in gluconeogenesis during growth on glycerol (9Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol.. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Google Scholar). A BLAST search of the sequenced genomes with the E. coli GlpX as a query revealed that the type II FBPases are quite conserved enzymes with over 100 sequences showing 50% or higher sequence identity. Besides E. coli, two genes encoding a type II FBPase were found in many strains of Shigella and Bacillus. Sequence alignment of GlpX and YggF with the experimentally verified type II FBPases from M. tuberculosis (46Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C. Wheeler P.R. Kendall S.L. Larson T.J. Stoker N.G. Microbiology.. 2004; 150: 3499-3505Google Scholar), C. glutamicum (47Rittmann D. Schaffer S. Wendisch V.F. Sahm H. Arch. Microbiol.. 2003; 180: 285-292Google Scholar), and Synechocystis PCC 6803 (16Tamoi M. Murakami A. Takeda T. Shigeoka S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 1998; 1383: 232-244Google Scholar) (42–44% sequence identity) identified over 50 conserved residues (Fig. 1). These sequences show the presence of four blocks of conserved residues (54VIGEGE59, 63APML66, 83AVDP86, and 186DGDV189). The block-3 is a part of the Li+-sensitive phosphatase motif DP(I/L)D(G/S)(T/S) (Fig. 1) that has been shown by crystallographic and mutational studies to bind metals and participate in catalysis (2York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Google Scholar, 48Ke H. Thorpe C.M. Seaton B.A. Marcus F. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1989; 86: 1475-1479Google Scholar). Previously, it has been mentioned that the presence of this sequence motif in proteins is not sufficient to identify family members per se (2York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Google Scholar). However, the FBPase II sequences revealed no presence of the extended Li+-sensitive phosphatase motif with the conserved combinations of EE, WD, or GG (2York J.D. Ponder J.W. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 5149-5153Google Scholar) suggesting that the class II FBPases are evolutionarily distant from the main group of Li+-sensitive phosphatases. Biochemical Characterization of GlpX and YggF—Purified GlpX and YggF exhibited a high fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity, a low activity toward glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (0.11–0.39 μmol/min mg protein), and no activity against ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, or fructose 1-phosphate. With fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as substrate, both proteins had maximal activity at pH 7.5–8.0 (data not shown) and required a divalent metal cation for activity. When tested with a range of divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+; 1 mm final concentration), only Mn2+ supported activity of both proteins. This is in contrast to FBPases from other classes, which can be activated by Mg2+, Mn2+, or Zn2+ (21Rashid N. Imanaka H. Kanai T. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 30649-30655Google Scholar, 49Marcus F. Rittenhouse J. Chatterjee T. Hosey M.M. Methods Enzymol.. 1982; 90: 352-357Google Scholar). GlpX had a slightly higher affinity to Mn2+ (KD 0.6 mm) than YggF (KD 1.0 mm) (Table 1). Moreover, GlpX showed higher activity and affinity to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate resulting in three times higher catalytic efficiency (Table 1). With this substrate, both proteins showed saturation kinetics with sigmoidal saturation curve with a Hill coefficient nH 2.0–2.1 indicating positive cooperativity in substrate binding. When compared with other E. coli FBP phosphatases, both GlpX and YggF showed lower substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency than those of Fbp, but they were more efficient in FBP hydrolysis than YaeD and YbhA, which belong to the haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphohydrolase superfamily (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of the E. coli FBPases, GlpX, YggF, Fbp, YaeD, and YbhAProteinVariable substrateKmVmaxaData are from Kelley-Loughnane et al.

https://openalex.org/W2031146128,"The latitudinal biodiversity gradient remains one of the most widely recognized yet puzzling patterns in nature. Presently, the high level of extinction of tropical species, referred to as the ""tropical biodiversity crisis"", has the potential to erode this pattern. While the connection between species richness, extinction, and speciation has long intrigued biologists, these interactions have experienced increased poignancy due to their relevancy to where we should concentrate our conservation efforts. Natural extinction is a phenomenon thought to have its own latitudinal gradient, with lower extinction rates in the tropics being reported in beetles, birds, mammals, and bivalves. Processes that have buffered ecosystems from high extinction rates in the past may also buffer ecosystems against disturbance of anthropogenic origin. While potential parallels between historical and present-day extinction patterns have been acknowledged, they remain only superficially explored and plant extinction patterns have been particularly neglected. Studies on the disappearances of animal species have reached conflicting conclusions, with the rate of extinction appearing either higher or lower in species richness hotspots. Our global study of extinction risk in vascular plants finds disproportionately higher extinction risk in tropical countries, even when indicators of human pressure (GDP, population density, forest cover change) are taken into account. Our results are at odds with the notion that the tropics represent a museum of plant biodiversity (places of historically lowered extinction) and we discuss mechanisms that may reconcile this apparent contradiction."
https://openalex.org/W2107807887,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cystitis and a non-cognate ligand of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in vitro. We studied whether CXCR4-MIF associations occur in rat bladder and the effect of experimental cystitis.Twenty male rats received saline or cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg; i.p.; every 3(rd) day) to induce persistent cystitis. After eight days, urine was collected and bladders excised under anesthesia. Bladder CXCR4 and CXCR4-MIF co-localization were examined with immunhistochemistry. ELISA determined MIF and stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1; cognate ligand for CXCR4) levels. Bladder CXCR4 expression (real-time RTC-PCR) and protein levels (Western blotting) were examined. Co-immunoprecipitations studied MIF-CXCR4 associations.Urothelial basal and intermediate (but not superficial) cells in saline-treated rats contained CXCR4, co-localized with MIF. Cyclophosphamide treatment caused: 1) significant redistribution of CXCR4 immunostaining to all urothelial layers (especially apical surface of superficial cells) and increased bladder CXCR4 expression; 2) increased urine MIF with decreased bladder MIF; 3) increased bladder SDF-1; 4) increased CXCR4-MIF associations.These data demonstrate CXCR4-MIF associations occur in vivo in rat bladder and increase in experimental cystitis. Thus, CXCR4 represents an alternative pathway for MIF-mediated signal transduction during bladder inflammation. In the bladder, MIF may compete with SDF-1 (cognate ligand) to activate signal transduction mediated by CXCR4."
https://openalex.org/W2022901458,"Enfuvirtide (T-20) is a fusion inhibitor that suppresses replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) variants with multi-drug resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. It is a peptide derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (C-HR) of HIV-1 gp41, and it prevents interactions between the C-HR and the N-terminal HR (N-HR) of gp41, thus interfering with conformational changes that are required for viral fusion. However, prolonged therapies with T-20 result in the emergence of T-20-resistant strains that contain primary mutations such as N43D in the N-HR of gp41 (where T-20 and C-HR bind) that help the virus escape at a fitness cost. Such variants often go on to acquire a secondary mutation, S138A, in the C-HR of gp41 region that corresponds to the sequence of T-20. We demonstrate here that the role of S138A is to compensate for the impaired fusion kinetics of HIV-1s carrying primary mutations that abrogate binding of T-20. To preempt this escape strategy, we designed a modified T-20 variant containing the S138A substitution and showed that it is a potent inhibitor of both T-20-sensitive and T-20-resistant viruses. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that the S138A provided increased stability of the 6-helix bundle. We validated our approach on another fusion inhibitor, C34. In this case, we designed a variant of C34 with the secondary escape mutation N126K and showed that it can effectively inhibit replication of C34-resistant HIV-1. These results prove that it is possible to design improved peptide-based fusion inhibitors that are efficient against a major mechanism of drug resistance.

After binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor and CCR5 (or CXCR4) coreceptor on the surface of the target cell, the gp41 trimer forms an extended conformation of the three helices that allows a hydrophobic fusion peptide to be inserted into the target cell membrane, generating an intermediate that is anchored to both cellular and viral membranes. After this step, the gp41 is believed to start refolding to a more stable 6-helix bundle composed of the α-helical trimer of the N-terminal heptad repeat (N-HR) folded into an anti-parallel conformation with the three C-terminal heptad repeats (C-HR) (1Chan D.C.

This refolding brings the viral and cellular membranes together to catalyze fusion. The transition of the extended intermediate to the 6-helix bundle can be inhibited by the addition of exogenous peptides derived from gp41 C-HR (Fig. 1A) that prevent the formation of the 6-helix bundle and inhibit the HIV-1 fusion with the target cells (3Jiang S.

During in vitro selection of C34 resistance, we identified a mutation in the C-HR domain, N126K, that is also observed in some T-20-resistant clinical variants (10Cabrera C. Marfil S. Garcia E.

We showed that N126K conferred resistance to C34 by compensating for the impaired intra-gp41 interaction by a primary mutation, I37K (13Nameki D. Kodama E. Ikeuchi M. Mabuchi N. Otaka A. Tamamura H. Ohno M. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). N126K was initially identified in background of V38A, another primary mutation, for T-20 resistance in vivo (17Baldwin C.E. Sanders R.W. Deng Y. Jurriaans S. Lange J.M. Lu M. Berkhout B. J.

Virol. 2008; 82: 7735-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) demonstrated a striking T-20-dependent replication phenotype in the V38A/N126K variant and proposed that T-20 acts as a safety pin to prevent premature formation of helical bundle, as N126K enhanced binding capacity of the introduced C-HR to N36 with V38A. Taken together, these studies suggest that mutations in the C-HR serve as secondary mutations. In this study we show that the main role of secondary mutations that follow the appearance of primary mutations during treatment with peptide-based fusion inhibitors is to compensate for the impairment in replication kinetics that is caused by the primary mutations (supplemental Fig. 1). Based on this finding we hypothesized that analogs of T-20 carrying substitutions corresponding to secondary T-20 resistance mutations should be active against both wild-type and T-20-resistant viruses containing primary mutations. Indeed, our results confirmed our hypothesis and showed that T-20 with the S138A substitution (T-20S138A) has a strong anti-HIV-1 activity even against T-20-resistant clones. Moreover, we demonstrate that this restoration is concomitant to improved binding of C-HRS138A to N-HRN43D, suggesting that our approach utilizing the resistance-associated mutations to design peptides may provide useful broad insights into effective peptide-based therapies. Cells and Viruses—MT-2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-based culture medium. HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal cells were kindly provided by M. Emerman through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) and were used for the drug susceptibility assay as described previously (13Nameki D.

An HIV-1 infectious clone, pNL4–3 (21Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used for generation of HIV-1 variants. Antiviral Agents—The peptides used in this study were synthesized as described previously (6Otaka A. Nakamura M. Nameki D. Kodama E. Uchiyama S. Nakamura S. Nakano H. Tamamura H. Kobayashi Y. Matsuoka M. Fujii N. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 2937-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Drug Susceptibility of HIV-1—The peptide sensitivity of infectious clones was determined by the multinuclear activation of galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay as described previously (13Nameki D. Kodama E. Ikeuchi M. Mabuchi N. Otaka A. Tamamura H. Ohno M. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the target cells (HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal; 104 cells/well) were plated in 96-well flat microtiter culture plates. On the following day the cells were inoculated with the HIV-1 clones (60 MAGI unit/well, giving 60 blue cells after 48 h of incubation) and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of drugs in fresh medium. Forty-eight hours after viral exposure, all the blue cells stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) were counted in each well. The activity of test compounds was determined as the concentration that blocked HIV-1 replication by 50% (50% effective concentration, (EC50). Generation of Recombinant HIV-1 Clones—Recombinant infectious HIV-1 clones, carrying various mutations, were generated as described previously (13Nameki D. Kodama E. Ikeuchi M. Mabuchi N. Otaka A. Tamamura H. Ohno M. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Each molecular clone was transfected into 293T cells with TransIT® (Madison, WI). After 48 h, the supernatants were harvested and stored at –80 °C until use. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Each peptide (10 μm) was mixed with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and the data were collected using a Jasco spectrometer (Model J-710; Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. The thermal stability was assessed by monitoring the change in the circular dichroism signal at 222 nm. The midpoint of the thermal unfolding transition (melting temperature, (Tm) of each complex was determined as described previously (6Otaka A. Nakamura M. Nameki D. Kodama E. Uchiyama S. Nakamura S. Nakano H. Tamamura H. Kobayashi Y. Matsuoka M. Fujii N. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 2937-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral Replication Kinetics Assay—MT-2 cells (105 cells/3 ml) were infected with each virus preparation (1000 MAGI unit) for 16 h. The infected cells were then washed and cultured in a final volume of 3 ml. The culture supernatants were harvested after infection on days 2–7, and the levels of p24 antigen were determined (22Hachiya A. Kodama E.N. Sarafianos S.G. Schuckmann M.M. Sakagami Y. Matsuoka M. Takiguchi M. Gatanaga H. Oka S. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 3261-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For each competitive HIV-1 replication assay, two infectious clones of interest that had been previously titrated were mixed and added to MT-2 cells (105 cells/3 ml) as described previously (13Nameki D.

To ensure that the two infectious clones being compared were of approximately equal infectivity, a fixed amount (500 MAGI unit) of one infectious clone was mixed with three different amounts (250, 500, and 1000 MAGI unit) of the other infectious clone. On day 1, one-third of the infected MT-2 cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cellular DNA was extracted. The purified DNA was subjected to nested PCR and then direct DNA sequencing. The HIV-1 co-culture, which best approximated a 50:50 mixture on day 1, was further propagated. Every 3–4 days, the co-culture supernatant (100 μl) was transmitted to new uninfected MT-2 cells (5 × 105 cells/3 ml). The cells harvested at the end of each passage were subjected to direct sequencing, and the viral population change was determined. Structure Modeling of gp41 S138A Mutant Core—The gp41 core model was built using the coordinates of crystal structure of the N36/C34 complex (23Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1AIK). The coordinates of the water molecules were removed. Additionally, the hydrogen atoms were placed in optimal positions and refined by the energy minimization with the AMBER9 program (24Case D.A. Cheatham 3rd, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6422) Google Scholar) using the FF99 force field. Ser-138 in the gp41 core model was replaced with alanine (replacement of -OH with -H), and the positions of the hydrogen atoms were refined as described above. The S138A mutant core model (N36/C34S138A complex) was further optimized by the energy minimization using the FF99 force field with the restraints on each of the three residues of N and C termini and the backbone atoms. The restraint weight was 5.0 kcal/mol Å2. Effect of Amino Acid Substitutions at 138 on Antiviral Activities—We chemically synthesized peptide analogs of T-20 with all natural amino acid substitutions at the 138 position (T-20S138X) and evaluated them for their ability to inhibit three major T-20-resistant clones using the MAGI assay (13Nameki D. Kodama E. Ikeuchi M. Mabuchi N. Otaka A. Tamamura H. Ohno M. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The results indicated that only T-20S138A inhibited replication of T-20-resistant clones as efficiently as the wild-type clone. Substitution to glycine enhanced T-20 activity, but unlike T-20S138A, T-20S138G reduced its activity against T-20-resistant clones by ∼2–3-fold as compared with the parental peptide, T-20. Substitutions to hydrophobic amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and methionine maintained their anti-HIV-1 activity; however, those to valine reduced anti-HIV-1 activity to T-20-resistant clones. The proline substitution drastically decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of the peptide inhibitors.TABLE 1Antiviral activity of T-20-derived peptides against T-20-resistant gp41 recombinant virusesEC50HIV-1WTaTo improve the replication kinetics, D36G mutation, observed in the majority of HIV-1 strains, was introduced into the NL4-3 background used in this study (reference virus).HIV-1V38AHIV-1N43DHIV-1N43D/S138AnmT-20>2.4 ± 0.623 ± 8.2 (9.6)49 ± 10 (20)84 ± 16 (35)Small T-20S138G1.3 ± 0.5 (0.5)65 ± 8.8 (27)141 ± 26 (59)185 ± 68 (77) T-20S138A0.6 ± 0.1 (0.3)3.6 ± 1.7 (1.5)3.5 ± 0.9 (1.5)3.2 ± 1.0 (1.3)Hydrophobic T-20S138V0.4 ± 0.2 (0.2)31 ± 14 (13)22 ± 3.5 (9.2)23 ± 5.7 (9.6) T-20S138L0.7 ± 0.1 (0.3)13 ± 6 (5.4)2.9 ± 0.7 (1.2)2.2 ± 0.4 (0.9) T-20S138I0.5 ± 0.1 (0.2)4.9 ± 2 (2)2.9 ± 0.8 (1.2)2.4 ± 0.6 (1) T-20S138M0.7 ± 0.2 (0.3)4.4 ± 0.1 (1.8)1.7 ± 0.5 (0.7)1.2 ± 0.4 (0.5) T-20S138P446 ± 167 (186)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)Nucleophilic T-20S138T0.9 ± 0.2 (0.4)39 ± 8.5 (16)161 ± 35 (67)124 ± 43 (52)Aromatic T-20S138F9.4 ± 2.6 (4)203 ± 89 (85)393 ± 119 (164)478 ± 116 (200) T-20S138Y25 ± 9 (10)516 ± 223 (215)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416) T-20S138V29 ± 14 (12)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)Amide T-20S138N19 ± 4 (8)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416) T-20S138Q34 ± 11 (14)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)Acidic T-20S138D210 ± 94 (88)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416) T-20S138E283 ± 80 (118)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)Basic T-20S138H210 ± 85 (88)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416) T-20S138K708 ± 145 (295)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416) T-20S138R362 ± 114 (150)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)>1000 (>416)a To improve the replication kinetics, D36G mutation, observed in the majority of HIV-1 strains, was introduced into the NL4-3 background used in this study (reference virus). Open table in a new tab Nucleophilic amino acid at position 138 of T-20 (T-20S138T) showed similar profiles. Conversely, aromatic and amide substitutions reduced the anti-HIV-1 activity of T-20 against HIV-1WT- and T-20-resistant clones. Other amino acid substitutions, especially acidic and basic amino acids, decreased the anti-HIV-1 inhibitory activity even against HIV-1WT. These results suggest that smaller hydrophobic (Ala > Leu, Ile) or more flexible (Met > Thr) residues are preferred in this position. Furthermore, the α-helical structure is important for the interaction, as a mutation to proline which is expected to disrupt the helix (25Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) resulted in an inactive T-20 analog. Circular Dichroism—To clarify the mechanism by which the substitutions at Ser-138 influence the antiviral activity of T-20 derivatives, we examined the binding affinities of these peptides to N-HR using circular dichroism (CD) analysis (Fig. 2). CD spectra reveal the presence of stable α-helical structure of the 6-helix bundle that is a requisite for biological activity and is thought to be mechanistically and thermodynamically correlated with HIV-1 fusion (26Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Therefore, CD spectra typically at 222 nm indicate interaction of N-HR (N36) and C-HR (T-20 or C34). Because T-20 does not interact significantly in vitro with the N36 peptide, which is derived from amino acids 35–70 of N-HR, we used a derivative of C34, a peptide that overlaps with T-20 and also inhibits HIV fusion by the same mechanism. The C34 derivative contained the analogous T-20 substitutions described above (Fig. 1B). Consistent with antiviral activities, a mixture of N36 and C34S138P or C34S138W showed no apparent or reduced α-helicity, respectively. For binding with N36V38A or N36N43D, sufficient α-helicity at 25 °C was observed only in C34S138A, C34S138L, and C34S138T or C34S138A, C34S138L, and C34S138W, respectively (Fig. 2, A–C). To determine the thermal stability of the helical complexes formed from the N36 and C34 peptides, we measured the melting temperature (Tm) of each complex (supplemental Table 1). The sigmoidal transition of the CD signal at 222 nm correlates with the thermal stability of the helical complexes formed from the N36 and C34 peptides, which in turn are indicative of the binding affinity of these peptides. The melting temperature (Tm) indicating the 50% disruption of 6-helix bundle was comparatively evaluated. Complexes of N36 and C34 containing the S138A or S138L substitutions (N36/C34S138A or N36/C34S138L) showed high thermal stability, comparable with that of the wild-type N36/C34 complex. Similarly, the addition of the S138A or S138L also improved the thermal stability of the N36N43D/C34 complex. These results reveal a striking correlation between the thermal stability and the anti-HIV-1 activity of the complexes (R2 = 0.75, Fig. 3). The low Tm value of the complex formed from N36N43D and C34 suggests that virus containing the N43D mutation shows high resistance to T-20, likely due to less favorable thermodynamics that are expected to drive the formation of the 6-helix bundles containing T-20 inhibitor. Antiviral Activity of Substituted C34 at Ser-138—To confirm that binding of C34 to N-HR is indeed representative of T-20 binding to N-HR, we examined the anti-HIV-1 activities of C34-derived peptides that have S138A substitutions. The C34S138A and C34S138L peptides showed potent anti-HIV-1 activities, similar to T-20S138A and T-20S138L (supplemental Table 2). Based on these findings, we conclude that the stability of complexes comprised of modified C34s and N36s containing T-20 resistance mutations offers a good measure of the binding affinity of T-20S138X to N-HR. Antiviral Activity of C34 with N126K—We have recently identified another mutation at the N-HR of gp41 (N126K) during exposure of HIV-1 to C34 in vitro (13Nameki D. Kodama E. Ikeuchi M. Mabuchi N. Otaka A. Tamamura H. Ohno M. Fujii N. Matsuoka M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The N126K has been occasionally observed after prolonged T-20-containing therapy (10Cabrera C. Marfil S. Garcia E. Martinez-Picado J. Bonjoch A. Bofill M. Moreno S. Ribera E. Domingo P. Clotet B.

Cane P.A. Greenberg M.L. Pillay D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed that the C34N126K peptide can also suppress a C34-resistant clone containing several mutations: I37K/N126K/L204I (Table 2). Therefore, peptides designed to have compensatory mutations seem to have potent antiviral activity. However, because residue 126 is located outside the amino acid sequence of T-20 (Fig. 1B), we could not examine the effect of N126K substitution on T-20 activity.TABLE 2Antiviral activity of C34N126K peptides against C34-resistant gp41 recombinant virusesEC50HIV-1WTaTo improve the replication kinetics, the D36G mutation, observed in majority of HIV-1 strains, was introduced into the NL4-3 background used in this study (reference virus).HIV-1ΔV4/I37K/N126K/L204IbC34-resistant HIV-1 was constructed with the reference virus as described (13).

ΔV4 indicates 5 amino acids deletion (FNSTW) in the V4 region of gp120. Open table in a new tab Replication Kinetics of Ser-138-substituted HIV-1—To evaluate the effect of Ser-138 substitutions on viral replication, we constructed molecular clones introducing several Ser-138 and determined their replication kinetics by measuring p24 gag antigen production in the culture supernatant. Single nucleotide changes to the TCA codon for Ser-138 may generate 4 amino acid substitutions, Ala, Thr, Leu, Pro, and Trp. As expected, the compensative substitution, S138A, in the T-20 resistance mutation N43D background enhanced replication kinetics of the N43D-containing clone as shown in supplemental Fig. 1. However, in the WT background the S138A appeared to decrease production of p24 as compared with HIV-1WT (Fig. 4). Other substitutions also reduced their replication kinetics. Interestingly, the S138W substitution did not show measurable p24 production. Syncytia induction and single cycle replication kinetics of the Ser-138-substituted HIV-1 were also examined (supplemental Fig. 2). Sizes of syncytia of each virus formed in the MAGI cells (supplemental Fig. 2, panels A–E) were associated with p24-normalized single-cycle infectivities (supplemental Fig. 2, panel F) and multicycle replication kinetics (Fig. 4). These results suggest that substitutions at Ser-138 are not likely to appear in the absence of T-20 therapy or the emergence of N43D mutation. Structure Modeling—The side chain of amino acid 138 (Ser or Ala) closely contacts with the hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu-44 and Leu-45 in the N-HR. The mutation from Ser to Ala increases hydrophobicity and may help to stabilize the N-HR/C-HR complex related with the potency of the HIV-1 fusion inhibitors (Fig. 5). Larger hydrophobic substitutions such as S138W, S138L, or S138I are likely to sterically interfere with efficient packing of the N-HR and C-HR helices. Similarly, introduction of charged residues at this region of the interface would also disrupt the hydrophobic environment and result in destabilized helix bundles, consistent with the biochemical and virological findings (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and Table 1).

At least 80 To genes have now been identified from seven orders of insect, including 20 from D. melanogaster, but few have been characterized in any detail. Due to the localization and/or expression profiles of their transcripts, some are proposed to have roles in chemosensory perception (5Bohbot J. Vogt R.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2005; 35: 961-979Google Scholar, 6Justice R.W. Dimitratos S. Walter M.F. Woods D.F. Biessmann H. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2003; 12: 581-594Google Scholar, 7Saito K. Su Z.H. Emi A. Mita K. Takeda M.

To proteins share limited sequence similarity and a conserved N-terminal disulfide bond with juvenile hormone-binding proteins (JHBPs). These proteins specifically bind and transport JH to target tissues in the Lepidoptera, further suggesting a role for To proteins in binding hydrophobic ligands (2So W.V. Sarov-Blat L. Kotarski C.K. McDonald M.J. Allada R. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 6935-6944Google Scholar). There are, however, two major differences between the families: a second disulfide bond in the JHBPs, not present in To; and the presence of two conserved C-terminal sequence motifs that are unique to the To family (2So W.V. Sarov-Blat L. Kotarski C.K. McDonald M.J. Allada R. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 6935-6944Google Scholar). Very recently, the structure of JHBP from the moth Galleria mellonella (GmJHBP) has been solved, revealing an unusual fold in which a highly curved antiparallel β-sheet wraps around a long α-helix (16Kolodziejczyk R. Bujacz G. Jakob M. Ozyhar A. Jaskolski M. Kochman M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2008; 377: 870-881Google Scholar). Although no direct evidence of ligand binding was obtained, two hydrophobic cavities were found within the protein, and it was hypothesized that one cavity binds JH. The presence of the second cavity was not anticipated, and its role remains unclear (16Kolodziejczyk R. Bujacz G. Jakob M. Ozyhar A. Jaskolski M. Kochman M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2008; 377: 870-881Google Scholar). In the light brown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana (Tortricidae: Lepidoptera), a common horticultural pest, we identified an abundant To protein (EpTo1) that is more highly expressed in male when compared with female antennae (17Jordan M. Stanley D. Marshall S.D.G. deSilva D. Crowhurst R.N. Gleave A.P. Greenwood D.R. Newcomb R.D. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2008; 17: 361-373Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of three additional To proteins from E. postvittana, and in an effort to gain a better understanding of the role(s) these proteins play in insects, we have determined the crystal structure of EpTo1. Our discovery of a surrogate ubiquinone ligand, bound deeply in the EpTo1 structure, gives the first direct evidence for ligand binding in To proteins and provides key data on the control of specificity and on likely mechanisms of ligand binding and release. Bioinformatics—Takeout sequences were identified within E. postvittana expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (17Jordan M. Stanley D. Marshall S.D.G. deSilva D. Crowhurst R.N. Gleave A.P. Greenwood D.R. Newcomb R.D. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2008; 17: 361-373Google Scholar) using BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res.. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar). ESTs encoding predicted To family members (EpTo1, EV812668; EpTo2, EV810864; EpTo3, EV812862; EpTo4, EV812824) were full-length sequenced (GenBank™ accession numbers: EpTo1, EU834740; EpTo2, EU834741; EpTo3, EU834742; EpTo4 EU834743). ButterflyBase, the Gene Database for Butterflies and Moths (34Papanicolaou A. Gebauer-Jung S. Blaxter M.L. Owen McMillan W. Jiggins C.D. Nucleic Acids Res.. 2008; 36: D582-D587Google Scholar), was searched to retrieve Lepidoptera JHBP and To sequences. Forty-two amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (19Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Bioinformatics (Oxf.).. 2007; 23: 2947-2948Google Scholar). Among the proteins included in this analysis, the Danaus plexippus BF01062B1H01.f1 sequence, which was proposed to be a To protein (32Zhu H. Casselman A. Reppert S.M. PLoS ONE.. 2008; 3: 1-8Google Scholar), is in fact a JHBP. Furthermore two sequences that were retrieved from a BLAST search for Manduca sexta JP29 homologues were not initially identified as To proteins. Agrius convolvuli AB294514 is referred as “Epidermal carotenoid-binding protein,” but no publication supporting this function has been released yet. EF082245 was identified from a spruce transcriptome EST project and was therefore proposed to be a protein from Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce). Given its high similarity with To proteins, it seems more likely that this protein in fact originates from unknown moth larvae that were harvested together with the spruce sample. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Jones-Taylor-Thornton distances and the FITCH algorithm from PHYLIP (20Felsenstein J. Cladistics.. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000 replicates. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Primers were designed to exclude the signal peptide sequence of EpTo1 (the first 20 amino acids). PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. Correct sequences were ligated into a pET30a vector (Novagen) to produce a His-tagged protein (His-To1). The resulting protein consists of (i) the His6 tag; (ii) 45 amino acids resulting from the pET30a vector; (iii) a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (ENLYFQ); and (iv) the native EpTo1 sequence of 220 residues. Expression was induced in E. coli Rosetta-Gami2 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside during growth in Terrific Broth medium at 20 °C. Bacteria were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole together with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were homogenized twice at 10,000 p.s.i. using an Emulsiflex C5 (Avestin). The soluble fraction was applied to a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. After dialysis for 16 h at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, His-To1 was further purified by anion exchange using a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) and a 50–500 mm NaCl linear elution gradient. His-To1 was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. Cleavage of the His tag was performed by incubating His-To1 with AcTEV™ (Invitrogen) for 18 h at 30 °C, using 1 unit/40 μg of protease/protein ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and ∼200 mm NaCl. The digestion reaction was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl at 20 °C and reapplied to a HisTrap column. The flowthrough was collected, and a final gel filtration step was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl as elution buffer. EpTo1 was finally concentrated to 40 mg/ml before crystallization trials. The integrity of the protein was checked by electrospray mass spectrometry. The experimental mass of EpTo1 was 24,479.7 Da, in agreement with the calculated value of 24,479.3 Da for the 220 residues of the native sequence. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—EpTo1 was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C. Drops comprised 0.7 μl of protein solution (25 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and 0.7 μl of reservoir solution (50 mm MES, pH 6.2–6.7; 20–25% polyethylene glycol 3000). Cryoprotection was by successive transfers of the crystals into mother liquor supplemented with 5, 10, 15, and 20% 3-methyl-1, 5-pentanediol. Two crystal forms (monoclinic P21 and orthorhombic P212121) were found in the same crystallization drops. The structure was solved by sulfur-SAD phasing using data collected on a Rigaku Micromax-007 HF generator, equipped with osmic optics and a Mar 345 detector. A highly redundant data set was collected to the maximum hardware resolution limit of 1.6 Å on a single P21 crystal. Data were processed with MOSFLM (21Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2006; 62: 48-57Google Scholar) and programs from the CCP4 package (2222. Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 (1994) Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 760–763Google Scholar). The structure solution and initial model building were performed automatically with the autoSHARP package (23Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2007; 364: 215-230Google Scholar). The final model was obtained by cycles of manual building in Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar) and refinement in Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1999; 55: 247-255Google Scholar) against a 1.3 Å resolution data set collected on the same crystal on the BL9-2 beam line (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) synchrotron, Stanford, CA). In the latter case, anisotropic individual B-factors were refined for all atoms. A 2.5 Å resolution data set was also collected in-house for the P212121 crystal form. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (26McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn L.C. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr.. 2007; 40: 658-674Google Scholar), using the P21 structure as template. Refinement was conducted with Refmac5, with individual isotropic B-factors for all atoms and one TLS group comprising the whole protein. In both structures, Leu-104 was found to lie in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). The unusual geometry of Leu-104, supported by unambiguous electron density maps, is due to hydrogen bonding of its carbonyl group to the guanidinium group of Arg-102. From the initial experimental maps and during the course of the refinement of both crystal forms, strong electron density was observed in σa-weighted 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc maps to account for a surrogate ligand. The shape of the additional electron density suggested a ubiquinone compound. After formal identification using thin layer chromatography and mass spectrometry (see below), ubiquinone-8 was included in both models in the final steps of the refinements. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under codes 3E8T and 3E8W for the P21 and the P212121 structures, respectively.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for the EpTo1 data setsCrystalSpace groupP21P21P212121Cell parameters (Å and °)a = 45.4, b = 45.0, c = 53.7, β = 108.7a = 45.5, b = 45.2, c = 53.8, β = 108.8a = 45.0, b = 54.1, c = 83.6Data setλ (Å)1.54 (Cu-Kα)0.97951 (SSRL BL9-2)1.54 (Cu-Kα)f″ (e)0.556Total rotation range (°)1980360300Reflections observed96280333515584738Unique reflections26782488657491Resolution (Å)24.2-1.6 (1.69-1.60)33.8-1.3 (1.37-1.30)34.6-2.5 (2.64-2.50)Rsym (%)5.4 (23.1)4.1 (40.7)11.0 (38.9)I/σ(I)65.6 (14.9)25.5 (3.2)20.2 (6.2)Completeness97.9 (87.0)96.1 (78.3)99.9 (99.8)Anomalous completeness97.7 (85.9)Multiplicity35.9 (33.6)6.9 (4.7)11.3 (11.4)Anomalous Multiplicity18.4 (17.1)DelAnom correlation between half-sets0.154 (0.510)Figure of merit (acentric/centric)0.26274/0.07481Phasing power0.637RefinementResolution (Å)31.2-1.3 (1.33-1.30)33.1-2.5 (2.56-2.50)Reflections48848 (2537)7458 (512)Number of atoms (protein/ligand/water)1784/53/3081719/53/83Rwork/Rfree14.4/18.2 (21.0/26.7)18.7/26.0 (21.2/35.9)Average B-factorsProtein/ligand/water17.9/40.8/33.024.5/48.5/22.8Protein N-terminal (residue range)25.5 (5-7)46.4 (2-7)protein C-terminal (residue range)30.9 (214-220)47.8 (214-220)Root mean square deviation bonds (Å)/angles (°)0.017/1.6650.013/1.408Ramachandran statistics of φ/ψ angles (%)Most favored90.788.3Additionally allowed8.811.2Generously allowed00Disallowed0.5 (Leu-104)0.5 (Leu-104) Open table in a new tab Ligand Identification—His-tagged EpTo1 was digested with proteinase K (4% w/w protease/protein ratio) for 24 h at 20 °C in a sealed glass tube. The reaction mixture was extracted with 800 μl of n-hexane. The extract was evaporated to ∼100 μl under nitrogen and analyzed by TLC on a precoated silica gel plate (Merck) with petroleum spirit/diethyl ether (85:15, v/v) as developing solvent. Ubiquinone-9 and ubiquinone-10 (Sigma) were analyzed simultaneously as standards. Spots were visualized under UV light (254 nm). The spots corresponding to the ligand, ubiquinone-9, and ubiquinone-10 were removed and extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) for 16 h. Aliquots were diluted 5-fold with methanol containing 0.1% formic acid and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The solutions were infused at 3 μl/min into a Thermo Finnigan LTQ-FTMS operating at a resolution of 100,000 at m/z 400. Full scan positive ion mass spectra were obtained at high mass accuracy, and selected parent ions were isolated for MSn analysis in the ion trap and also in the ion cyclotron resonance cell when the signals were sufficiently intense. Identification of Four New Takeout Family Members—Four sequences that share similarities with To gene sequences were found among the 5739 EST sequences from male antennae of E. postvittana (17Jordan M. Stanley D. Marshall S.D.G. deSilva D. Crowhurst R.N. Gleave A.P. Greenwood D.R. Newcomb R.D. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2008; 17: 361-373Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses of Lepidoptera JHPB/To protein sequences show that the To proteins fall into six distinct lineages, with the JHBPs forming an outlier group within the superfamily (Fig. 1) (7Saito K. Su Z.H. Emi A. Mita K. Takeda M. Fujiwara Y. Insect Mol. Biol.. 2006; 15: 245-251Google Scholar, 11Hagai T. Cohen M. Bloch G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2007; 37: 689-701Google Scholar). Five of the six Lepidoptera To lineages (Lep1, Lep3, Lep4, Lep5, and Lep6) are supported by high bootstrap values. All lineages contain proteins from various species and the four E. postvittana To proteins belong to separate lineages (Fig. 1). When proteins from other insect species are added, the five strongly supported Lepidopteran lineages (Lep1, Lep3, Lep4, Lep5, and Lep6) remain separate from the eight lineages previously described (11Hagai T. Cohen M. Bloch G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol.. 2007; 37: 689-701Google Scholar), resulting in a complex tree with multiple lineages (supplemental Fig. 1). Structure Determination of E. postvittana Takeout 1 (EpTo1)—EpTo1 was overexpressed in E. coli and crystallized in two crystal forms, with space groups P21 and P212121 (Table 1). The structure of the P21 form was solved in-house by sulfur-SAD phasing, using 1.6 Å diffraction data. Despite the low Bijvoet ratio of 1.16 for Cu-Kα radiation (EpTo1 contains only eight sulfurs out of 1724 atoms, with six Met and two Cys residues), the 36-fold redundant data set allowed straightforward structure determination. Automated building in autoSHARP (23Vonrhein C. Blanc E. Roversi P. Bricogne G. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2007; 364: 215-230Google Scholar) fitted 209 out of 220 residues and refinement against a second, 1.3 Å resolution data set, collected on the same crystal at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, gave a high quality final model comprising residues 5–220, with R = 0.144, Rfree = 0.182 (Table 1). The structure of the P212121 form of EpTo1 was also solved by molecular replacement with the P21 structure as template and refined at 2.5 Å resolution. Overall Structure—EpTo1 adopts an unusual α/β fold in which a central, highly curved antiparallel five-stranded β-sheet wraps around a long helix, α3, to form a cylindrical barrel ∼65 Å long and ∼30 Å in diameter (Fig. 2, A and B). Two helices (α1 and α2) complement the β-sheet at both ends. The curvature of the β-sheet is due to a series of β-bulges that change the direction of the strands at regular intervals, dividing the individual strands into two or three fragments. At the top of the barrel (as oriented in Fig. 2A), an N-terminal arm lies across the barrel, together with a C-terminal arm and short helix α4. Finally, a β-hairpin is inserted between α1 and β1. A key feature of the top of the barrel is the conserved disulfide bond, between Cys-8 and Cys-15, which joins the N-terminal arm to the first turn of the antiparallel helix α1. This disulfide bond seems likely to be critical for the structure of the opening to the ligand-binding tunnel, described below, rather than for stabilizing the overall structure. The N-terminal arm itself is somewhat flexible as the first four residues are disordered in the P21 crystal form. In contrast, in the P212121 crystal form, residues 2–4 adopt well defined conformations, apparently due to crystal contacts with another molecule, and only Gly-1 is disordered. This is the only significant difference between the two structures. Structural superposition over residues 5–220 of both structures gives root mean square deviations of 0.8 and 0.3 Å for all atoms and Cα atoms, respectively. Ligand-binding Tunnel and Bound Surrogate Ligand—The most striking feature of the EpTo1 structure is the large central tunnel, ∼45 Å long; beginning with a slightly wider cavity at the top of the molecule, it extends for the entire length of the barrel (Fig. 2C). All of the main structural elements of the molecule participate in shaping the tunnel; the twisted β-sheet, α1, α2, and α3 build a hollow tube, capped at the top end by the N-terminal arm and the C-terminal α4 and at the bottom end by the β3-β4 loop and parts of α2. In the P21 structure, the top cavity is slightly open due to the absence of the first four N-terminal residues from the model. In contrast, in the P212121 structure, residues Val-2, Leu-3, and Pro-4 cover the opening and build a completely enclosed cavity and tunnel. The internal surface of the tunnel is almost exclusively hydrophobic, lined by the side chains of some 57 hydrophobic residues (Fig. 3). The few polar atoms at or close to the internal surface of the tunnel come from the amide and carbonyl moieties of the protein main chain, and most are engaged in interstrand hydrogen bonds of the β-sheet or interturn hydrogen bonds of α3. The only exceptions are Glu-6, Phe-189, and Ile-217. The carbonyl moiety of Phe-189 is not hydrogen-bonded but does not point into the tunnel. In contrast, the carbonyls of Glu-6 and Ile-217 are close together, both directed inwards, toward the center of the opening cavity (Fig. 3). In the P21 structure, these two carbonyls bind the only water molecule found inside the cavity (HOH 265). In both structures, a ∼35 Å long stretch of electron density was observed inside the tunnel (Fig. 2D). The electron density suggested a ubiquinone molecule, and formal identification was achieved by TLC followed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4). The parent ion mass found at m/z 727.56657 and the MS2 protonated parent fragments at m/z 709.44, 695.46, 667.57, 531.47, and 235.11 unambiguously identify the ligand as ubiquinone-8, which is the major isoprenoid quinone in E. coli (27Gao M. Liu H. Yang M. Hu J. Shao B. J. Basic Microbiol.. 2004; 44: 424-429Google Scholar). The ubiquinone-8 moiety fills almost the entire tunnel, with the quinone group positioned in the top cavity and the eight isoprenyl subunits extending all the way to the bottom. The electron density of the bound ligand is of moderate quality when compared with the rest of the structure (Fig. 2D), with B-factors for the ligand typically twice as high as those of the surrounding protein atoms. The Conserved Takeout Motifs Form One Takeout Region—A distinctive feature of the To proteins, not present in JHBPs, is the two conserved To sequence motifs (2So W.V. Sarov-Blat L. Kotarski C.K. McDonald M.J. Allada R. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 6935-6944Google Scholar). In the EpTo1 structure, both motifs cluster together to form a single To region, exposed at the bottom end of the barrel (Fig. 5, B and C). Motif 1 (residues 97–113) consists of the end of β3, the β3-β4 loop, and the start of β4, whereas Motif 2 (residues 160–182) includes the long β5-α2 loop and the whole α2 helix. A network of six hydrogen bonds involving Tyr-97, Thr-109, Asp-111, Gln-113, Thr-161, Asn-162, and Phe-164 provides a tight interaction between Motif 1 and Motif 2 and confers structural integrity to the whole To region (Fig. 5B). Six hydrophobic residues from the To region (Tyr-97, Ala-99, Ile-103, Ile-108, Leu-160, and Leu-178) are buried inside the molecule and shape the end of the tunnel (Fig. 3). With the sole exception of Leu-163, whose side chain is buried between the surface of the protein and the internal tunnel, all other residues within the To region have their side chains at least partially exposed at the surface of the protein. Leu-104, Ile-105, Leu-106, Pro-107, Phe-164, Leu-170, Met-174, and Phe-177, whose hydrophobic character is very conserved for all members of the family, form a long hydrophobic groove at the surface of the molecule between Motif 1 and Motif 2 (Fig. 5D). The remaining residues of the To region are mostly polar or charged and are located on both sides of the groove. Comparison with GmJHBP—Comparison of EpTo1 with GmJHBP (16Kolodziejczyk R. Bujacz G. Jakob M. Ozyhar A. Jaskolski M. Kochman M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2008; 377: 870-881Google Scholar) reveals structural differences that are clearly related to ligand specificity and functional variation in the JHBP/To superfamily. With only 18% sequence identity, these two proteins are distantly related members of this family (Fig. 1) but have the same α/β barrel fold. Structural superposition gives a root mean square difference of 3.0 Å over 202 Cα atoms, with structural conservation over α1, the N-terminal disulfide bond, the hairpin, the five-stranded twisted β-sheet and, to a lesser extent, the long α3 helix (Fig. 5A). Two key differences shape the respective binding cavities and To motif regions, however. The first difference results from the presence of a second disulfide bond in GmJHBP, which is strictly conserved for JHBPs but absent in To proteins. This disulfide, between Cys-151 and Cys-195 in GmJHBP, anchors α3 to the β-sheet in the central part of the barrel and triggers the formation of two separate cavities (16Kolodziejczyk R. Bujacz G. Jakob M. Ozyhar A. Jaskolski M. Kochman M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2008; 377: 870-881Google Scholar). In the absence of this disulfide in EpTo1, α3 is shifted away by up to 5 Å from the β-sheet (Fig. 5B), creating more space in the core of the protein and a long continuous tunnel instead of two smaller cavities. The second conspicuous difference is the presence of a proline residue, Pro-192, in the third turn of α3 in EpTo1. The effect of this substitution, which is very common in To proteins, is to produce a marked kink in α3 that leads to an alternative organization of the bottom part of the EpTo1 barrel, including the whole To region (Fig. 5B). In EpTo1, the β3-β4 loop of Motif 1 extends across the barrel, closing the end of the ligand-binding cavity, whereas the equivalent β-hairpin in GmJHBP points away from the barrel (Fig. 5, A and B). This results in a ∼15 Å shift of the tip of Motif 1 in the two proteins. To complete the enclosure of the barrel, the region following β5 also undergoes major reorganization. In GmJHBP, β5 is followed by two orthogonal helices α2 and α3, whereas in EpTo1, β5 is followed by a loop and a helix (α2, corresponding to α3 in GmJHBP). Importantly, in EpTo1, the β5-α2 loop, which belongs to Motif 2, interacts directly with Motif 1 through a network of six hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5B). After Motif 2, the two structures remain divergent, with their respective N-terminal parts of α3 oriented at an angle of ∼40° relative to each other. A similar conformation is only regained after the kink in α3 observed in the EpTo1 structure. As a consequence of this large reorganization, the tunnel is closed off at the bottom end of the EpTo1 barrel, whereas in GmJHBP, the bottom cavity is wide open to the solvent (16Kolodziejczyk R. Bujacz G. Jakob M. Ozyhar A. Jaskolski M. Kochman M. J. Mol. Biol.. 2008; 377: 870-881Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, C and D). The top cavity in the GmJHBP structure is also open due to reorientation of the N-terminal arm, which interacts with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal. We fin"
https://openalex.org/W1995881800,"Epidemiological studies have revealed that prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of cancer. Various mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the growth and invasion of cancer cells, have been implicated in this anti-tumorigenic activity. In this study we focused on S100P, which is known to be overexpressed in clinically isolated tumors and which functions through both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms. We showed the up-regulation of S100P expression in human gastric carcinoma cells treated with various NSAIDs, including celecoxib. The celecoxib-mediated up-regulation of S100P was suppressed by the transfection of cells with small interfering RNA for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Furthermore, deletion of ATF4 binding consensus sequence located in the promoter of the S100P gene resulted in inhibition of celecoxibmediated transcriptional activation of the gene. These results suggest that celecoxib up-regulates the expression of S100P through an ATF4-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Celecoxib inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis, and these actions could be either suppressed or stimulated by transfection of cells with S100P overexpression plasmid or small interfering RNA, respectively. Celecoxib also inhibited the invasive activity of the cells. Cromolyn, which inhibits the binding of S100P to its receptor, enhanced the celecoxib-mediated inhibition of cell invasion and growth but did not affect apoptosis. These results suggest that S100P affects apoptosis, cell growth, and invasion through either an intracellular or an extracellular mechanism and that the up-regulation of S100P expression by NSAIDs reduces their anti-tumorigenic activity.

In addition to their anti-inflammatory effects, recent epidemiological studies have revealed that prolonged NSAID use reduces the risk of cancer, whereas preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that some NSAIDs, in particular celecoxib, are effective in the treatment and prevention of cancer (1Wang W.H. Huang J.Q. Zheng G.F. Lam S.K. Karlberg J. Wong B.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The anti-tumorigenic activity of NSAIDs is believed to involve various mechanisms, including induction of apoptosis, cell growth suppression, inhibition of angiogenesis, and inhibition of metastasis (cell invasion suppression) (2Gupta R.A. Dubois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 3Kismet K. Akay M.T. Abbasoglu O. Ercan A. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2004; 28: 127-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). NSAIDs act as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs). PGs, such as PGE2, inhibit apoptosis of cancer cells and stimulate their growth and invasion as well as promote angiogenesis (4Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T.

Cancer Inst. 1980; 64: 1061-1070PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is certain that the anti-tumorigenic effect of NSAIDs was mediated mainly through the inhibition of COX. However, several lines of evidence now suggest that a COX-independent mechanism may also be involved (7Piazza G.A. Alberts D.S. Hixson L.J. Paranka N.S. Li H. Finn T. Bogert C. Guillen J.M.

Kelloff G.J. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3387-3391PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this COX-independent mechanism, we used DNA microarray techniques to systematically search for genes in human gastric carcinoma (AGS) cells whose expression was altered by the NSAID indomethacin in a COX-independent manner (9Mima S. Takehara M. Takada H. Nishimira T. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 10: 1994-2000Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Mima S. Tsutsumi S. Ushijima H. Takeda M. Fukuda I. Yokomizo K.

This analysis revealed that NSAIDs induce an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response (11Tsutsumi S. Gotoh T. Tomisato W. Mima S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mori M. Mizushima T. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ER stress response is induced through transcription factors, such as activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) 6 and ATF4 (12Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 13Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 14Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), and we have previously reported that both ATF4 and ATF6 are activated by various NSAIDs, including indomethacin and celecoxib (15Tsutsumi S.

In this study we focused our attention on S100P, the expression of which appears to be induced by indomethacin based on results from DNA microarray analysis (10Mima S. Tsutsumi S. Ushijima H.

S100P is a member of the S100 family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (17Becker T. Gerke V. Kube E. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Overexpression of S100P has been observed in tumors clinically isolated from various tissue types, with the extent of the overexpression being positively correlated to the degree of malignancy (18Shyu R.Y.

Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Secreted S100P binds to its receptor, the receptor for activated glycation end products (RAGE), thereby stimulating the invasion and growth of cancer cells or inhibiting their apoptosis through activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (20Arumugam T.

It has recently been reported that S100P induces the expression of cathepsin D; however, the mechanism responsible for this effect is still to be identified (31Whiteman H.J. Weeks M.E. Dowen S.E. Barry S. Timms J.F. Lemoine N.R. Crnogorac-Jurcevic T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8633-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that the expression of S100P is altered by some anti-tumor drugs (18Shyu R.Y. Huang S.L. Jiang S.Y. J. Biomed.

In this study we report that various NSAIDs up-regulate the expression of S100P through an ATF4-mediated ER stress response. Furthermore, our results suggest that up-regulation of S100P expression by NSAIDs negatively affects their anti-tumorigenic activity through inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of cancer cell growth and invasion.

Cell Culture and Overexpression of S100P—AGS, MKN45, and Kato III are human carcinoma cell lines derived from stomach. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. NSAIDs were dissolved in DMSO, and control experiments were performed in the same concentrations of DMSO alone. Cells were exposed to NSAIDs and other chemicals by changing the medium. Unless otherwise noted, cells were cultured for 24 h before use in experiments. The overexpression plasmid for S100P was constructed by insertion of S100P-encoding DNA fragments from the plasmid (S100P wild type (His tag), a gift from Dr. Gerke, University of Muenster (28Koltzscher M. Neumann C. Konig S. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2372-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) into pcDNA3.1. Transfection of AGS cells with the plasmid was then carried out using Lipofectamine (TM2000) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Stable transfectants expressing S100P were selected by immunoblotting analysis. Positive clones were maintained in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were reverse-transcribed using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. Synthesized cDNA was applied in real-time RT-PCR (Chromo 4 instrument (Bio-Rad)) experiments using iQ SYBR GREEN Supermix and analyzed with Opticon Monitor Software. The cycle conditions were 2 min at 50 °C followed by 10 min at 90 °C and finally 45 cycles each at 95 °C for 30 s and 63 °C for 60 s. Specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the reaction products and by inclusion of template- or reverse transcriptase-free controls. To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, the actin gene was used as an internal standard. Primers were designed using the Primer3 Web site.

Luciferase Assay—DNA fragments of the S100P promoter (from –1200 to –1) were amplified by PCR and ligated into the XhoI-HindIII site of the Photinus pyralis luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3, to generate pS100Pluc. A plasmid with deletion of the amino acid-responsible element (AARE) sequence (33Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol.

Cells were transfected with 1 μg of each of the P. pyralis luciferase reporter plasmids (pS100Pluc or its derivative) and 0.125 μg of the internal standard plasmid bearing the Renilla reniformis luciferase reporter (pRL-SV40). P. pyralis luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System and then normalized for R. reniformis luciferase activity. Gelatin Zymography—The proteolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was assessed by SDS-PAGE using zymogram gels containing 0.1% (m/v) gelatin, as described previously (36Taraboletti G. Sonzogni L. Vergani V. Hosseini G. Ceruti R. Ghilardi C. Bastone A. Toschi E. Borsotti P. Scanziani E. Giavazzi R. Pepper M.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Bani M.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The culture medium was concentrated, and the protein concentration was determined according to the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis at 4 °C, the gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with zymogram development buffer for 2 days at 37 °C. Bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (38Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the samples was determined by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). Samples were applied to polyacrylamide SDS gels and subjected to electrophoresis, and the resultant proteins were then immunoblotted with their respective antibodies. Analysis of Apoptosis by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Apoptosis was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as described previously (39Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were fixed with 70% ethanol for 4 h at –20 °C, centrifuged, and re-suspended in phosphate-citrate buffer (0.2 m Na2HPO4 and 4 mm citric acid), then incubated for 20 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the pellets were re-suspended in DNA staining solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were scanned with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) cell sorter under conditions designed to measure only specific propidium iodide-mediated fluorescence. Apoptotic cells appeared as a hypodiploid peak due to nuclear fragmentation and loss of DNA. Invasion Assay—The invasion assay was performed as previously described (40Munoz-Najar U.M. Neurath K.M. Vumbaca F. Claffey K.P. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2379-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 mg/ml Matrigel was applied to the upper chamber of a 24-well transwell and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cell suspension was applied to the Matrigel, and the lower chamber of the transwell was filled with culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 μg/ml fibronectin. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane, and the lower surface of the membrane was stained for 10 min with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol, rinsed with distilled water, and air-dried overnight. The crystal violet was then extracted with 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol, and the absorbance was measured at 585 nm. siRNA Targeting of Genes—We used siRNA of 5′-GCCUAGGUCUCUUAGAUGAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UCAUCUAAGAGACCUAGGCdTdT-3′ or 5′-GCAACCAAUUAUCAGUUUAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UAAACUGAUAAUUGGUUGCdTdT-3′ as annealed oligonucleotides for repressing ATF4 or ATF6 expression, respectively. The siRNA for S100P was purchased from Qiagen. AGS cells were transfected with siRNA using RNAiFect or HiPerFect transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Non-silencing siRNA (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′ and 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′) was used as a negative control. Xenograft Tumor Growth—This assay was done as described (15Tsutsumi S. Namba T.

Briefly, each nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse was inoculated subcutaneously in the both flanks with 1 × 107 AGS cells. After 3 weeks, the mice began to receive a single daily intraperitoneal administration of cromolym, a protocol that continued for the duration of the study. Tumors were measured every 7 days, and their volumes were calculated. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Two-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test or the Student's t test for unpaired results was used to evaluate differences between more than three groups or between two groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. NSAIDs Up-regulate S100P Expression—In a previous study we used DNA microarray analysis to search for genes whose expression is altered by indomethacin and found that S100P mRNA expression was up-regulated (10Mima S. Tsutsumi S. Ushijima H. Takeda M. Fukuda I. Yokomizo K. Suzuki K. Sano K. Nakanishi T. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed this result using a real-time RT-PCR technique. As shown in Fig. 1A, indomethacin up-regulated S100P mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. A similar result was obtained with the NSAID celecoxib, a finding that is particularly significant given its importance as an anti-cancer drug (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting experiments revealed that celecoxib also up-regulates the expression of S100P at the protein level in both AGS cells and in another gastric cancer-derived cell line, MKN45 cells (Fig. 2, A and E). A similar response was observed in AGS cells with a number of other NSAIDs (indomethacin, meloxicam, and diclofenac; Fig. 2, B–D).FIGURE 2Up-regulation of S100P expression by NSAIDs. AGS (A–D and G), MKN-45 (E), or Kato III (F) cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of NSAIDs for 12 h (A and E–G) or 24 h (B–D). Whole cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against S100P or actin (A–F). The level of S100P in the culture medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Given that celecoxib and meloxicam are COX-2 selective, the results shown in Fig. 2, A–D, suggest that NSAIDs up-regulate S100P expression irrespective of COX selectivity. We next examined the celecoxib-mediated up-regulation of S100P expression in Kato III cells, in which COX-1 but not COX-2 mRNA is expressed (41Saukkonen K. Nieminen O. van Rees B. Vilkki S. Harkonen M. Juhola M. Mecklin J.P. Sipponen P. Ristimaki A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1923-1931PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype was confirmed by RT-PCR (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2F, celecoxib up-regulated the expression of S100P even in the Kato III cells; in other words, a COX-2-selective NSAID up-regulated S100P expression in cells lacking COX-2 expression, suggesting that this occurs independently of COX inhibition. For further confirmation of this point, we examined the effect of PGE2, revealing that it had no effect on the expression of S100P in the presence or absence of celecoxib (data not shown). As described above, secreted S100P regulates various cell functions through its binding to RAGE (20Arumugam T. Simeone D.M. Van Golen K. Logsdon C.D. Clin.

We monitored the level of S100P in the culture medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and found that it increased in a dose-dependent manner in response to celecoxib treatment (Fig. 2G). Mechanism for Up-regulation of S100P Expression by Celecoxib—As outlined above, the mechanism underlying the regulation of S100P expression is unknown. We have recently revealed that various NSAIDs including celecoxib induce an ER stress response, and the concentration of each NSAID required to mediate this response (15Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) is similar to that which induces S100P expression (Fig. 2). We investigated the role of ER stress response in NSAID-induced S100P expression by examining the effect of other ER stress-inducing chemicals (thapsigargin and tunicamycin) on the expression of S100P mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, both of these chemicals increased S100P mRNA. We also confirmed that both agents up-regulated the expression of glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78 mRNA, a representative marker of the ER stress response at the concentration specified in Fig. 3, A and B (data not shown). In contrast, exposure to staurosporine, which does not produce such a response (15Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T.

To confirm this we examined the effect of BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, on celecoxib-mediated up-regulation of S100P. We have previously shown that NSAIDs increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and that this increase is required for the NSAID-induced ER stress response (15Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I.

https://openalex.org/W2000059703,"Biofilms are prevalent in diseases caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen. By a proteomic approach, we previously identified a hypothetical protein of P. aeruginosa (coded by the gene pA3731) that was accumulated by biofilm cells. We report here that a Delta pA3731 mutant is highly biofilm-defective as compared with the wild-type strain. Using a mouse model of lung infection, we show that the mutation also induces a defect in bacterial growth during the acute phase of infection and an attenuation of the virulence. The pA3731 gene is found to control positively the ability to swarm and to produce extracellular rhamnolipids, and belongs to a cluster of 4 genes (pA3729-pA3732) not previously described in P. aeruginosa. Though the protein PA3731 has a predicted secondary structure similar to that of the Phage Shock Protein, some obvious differences are observed compared to already described psp systems, e.g., this unknown cluster is monocistronic and no homology is found between the other proteins constituting this locus and psp proteins. As E. coli PspA, the amount of the protein PA3731 is enlarged by an osmotic shock, however, not affected by a heat shock. We consequently named this locus bac for biofilm-associated cluster."
https://openalex.org/W1998657976,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that infects 20 to 90% of the population. It can cause both acute and chronic infections, many of which are asymptomatic, and, in immunocompromised hosts, can cause fatal infection due to reactivation from an asymptomatic chronic infection. An essential step towards understanding molecular mechanisms controlling transitions between the various life stages and identifying candidate drug targets is to accurately characterize the T. gondii proteome.We have explored the proteome of T. gondii tachyzoites with high throughput proteomics experiments and by comparison to publicly available cDNA sequence data. Mass spectrometry analysis validated 2,477 gene coding regions with 6,438 possible alternative gene predictions; approximately one third of the T. gondii proteome. The proteomics survey identified 609 proteins that are unique to Toxoplasma as compared to any known species including other Apicomplexan. Computational analysis identified 787 cases of possible gene duplication events and located at least 6,089 gene coding regions. Commonly used gene prediction algorithms produce very disparate sets of protein sequences, with pairwise overlaps ranging from 1.4% to 12%. Through this experimental and computational exercise we benchmarked gene prediction methods and observed false negative rates of 31 to 43%.This study not only provides the largest proteomics exploration of the T. gondii proteome, but illustrates how high throughput proteomics experiments can elucidate correct gene structures in genomes."
https://openalex.org/W1972636316,"Leukocyte beta2-integrin CD11b/CD18 mediates the firm adhesion and subsequent transepithelial migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but the identity of its counter-receptor(s) on epithelia remains elusive. Here we identified a monoclonal antibody, clone C3H7, which strongly bound to the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells and inhibited both the adhesion of epithelial cells to immobilized CD11b/CD8 and the transepithelial migration of PMNs in a physiologically relevant basolateral-to-apical direction. C3H7 antigen expression in epithelial monolayers was significantly increased by treatment with proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma or a combination of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Up-regulation of C3H7 antigen was also observed in the epithelium of inflamed human colon tissues. Microsequencing and Western blotting of the purified antigen showed it to be CD44 variant 3 (CD44v3), a approximately 160-kDa membrane glycoprotein. Further studies demonstrated that this epithelial CD44v3 specifically binds to CD11b/CD18 through its heparan sulfate moieties. In summary, our study demonstrates for the first time that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan form of epithelial CD44v3 plays a critical role in facilitating PMN recruitment during inflammatory episodes via directly binding to CD11b/CD18."
https://openalex.org/W2060859541,"The integrins are bi-directional signal transducers. Devoid of enzymatic activity, the integrin cytoplasmic tail serves as a hub for the recruitment of cytosolic proteins, and many of these are signaling molecules. The leukocyte-restricted integrin alphaLbeta2 is essential for the adhesion, migration, and proliferation of leukocytes. Here we report solution conformations and interactions of the alphaLbeta2 cytoplasmic tails by NMR analyses. The alphaL tail is characterized by three helical segments in the order of helix 1-3 that are connected by two loops with helix 3 having a number of nuclear Overhauser effect contacts with helix 1 and helix 2. The conformation of the beta2 tail is less defined with only a helical segment restricted at its N terminus. Acidic residues from the helix 2-loop-helix 3 motif of alphaL were found to be responsible for its binding to calcium ion. There were detectable interactions between alphaL and beta2 tails, involving helix 1 and helix 3 of the alphaL tail and the N-terminal helix of the beta2 tail. Talin head domain that contains the FERM domain showed binding affinity of Kd approximately 0.5 microm with the beta2 tail. The binding affinity of alphaL and beta2 tails is Kd approximately 2.63 microm. These data are in line with the activating property of talin head domain on alphaLbeta2 by which binding of talin head domain to beta2 tail disrupts the interface of the alphaL and beta2 tails that constrains alphaLbeta2 in a resting state."
https://openalex.org/W1997987888,"SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1) is a member of the AGC branch of the protein kinase family. Among well described functions of SGK1 is the regulation of epithelial transport through phosphorylation of the ubiquitin protein ligase Nedd4-2 (neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated 4-2). The activation of SGK1 has been widely accepted to be dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr256 in the activation loop and Ser422 in the hydrophobic motif near the C terminus. Here, we report the identification of two additional phosphorylation sites, Ser397 and Ser401. Both are required for maximum SGK1 activity induced by extracellular agents or by coexpression with other protein kinases, with the largest loss of activity from mutation of Ser397. Coexpression with active Akt1 increased the phosphorylation of Ser397 and thereby SGK1 kinase activity. SGK1 activation was further augmented by coexpression with the protein kinase WNK1 (with no lysine kinase 1). These findings reveal further complexity underlying the regulation of SGK1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1969403812,During a five-year GPS satellite tracking study in Sabi Sand Reserve (SSR) and Kruger National Park (KNP) we monitored the daily movements of an elephant cow (Loxodonta africana) from September 2003 to August 2008. The study animal was confirmed to be part of a group of seven elephants therefore her position is representative of the matriarchal group. We found that the study animal did not use habitat randomly and confirmed strong seasonal fidelity to its summer and winter five-year home ranges. The cow's summer home range was in KNP in an area more than four times that of her SSR winter home range. She exhibited clear park habitation with up to three visits per year travelling via a well-defined northern or southern corridor. There was a positive correlation between the daily distance the elephant walked and minimum daily temperature and the elephant was significantly closer to rivers and artificial waterholes than would be expected if it were moving randomly in KNP and SSR. Transect lines established through the home ranges were surveyed to further understand the fine scale of the landscape and vegetation representative of the home ranges.

FEN1 is a nuclease that plays an important role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. We show that FEN1 is in complex with telomerase in vivo via telomeric DNA.

In cancer cells, FEN1 deficiency induces gradual shortening of telomeres but does not alter the single-stranded G-overhangs.

Telomeres are distinct DNA-protein structures that protect eukaryotic chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate recombination or fusions. Maintenance of functional telomeres is essential for long term cell proliferation and stem cell self-renewal. In normal human somatic cells, telomeres progressively shorten each time a cell divides (1Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature.. 1990; 345: 458-460Google Scholar). When a subset of telomeres becomes critically short, these short telomeres are recognized as damaged DNA (1Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature.. 1990; 345: 458-460Google Scholar, 2Zou Y.

To counteract telomere shortening, the cells activate a special reverse transcriptase, telomerase, to elongate short telomeres. Telomerase adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends, thus keeping telomeres functional (10Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Henderson E. Lee M.S. Shampay J. Shippen-Lentz D. Genome.. 1989; 31: 553-560Google Scholar, 11Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell.. 1985; 43: 405-413Google Scholar). Indeed, telomerase is up-regulated in cells that need long term proliferation potential such as embryonic stem cells, germline cells, cancer stem cells, activated lymphocytes, and the majority of human cancer cells (12Hiyama E. Hiyama K. Br J. Cancer.. 2007; 96: 1020-1024Google Scholar, 13Flores I. Benetti R. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 2006; 18: 254-260Google Scholar, 14Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Curr. Opin.

Drug Discov.. 2006; 5: 577-584Google Scholar). The critical roles of telomerase in tumor proliferation and stem cell behavior underscore the importance of understanding the regulatory mechanisms for telomerase action at telomeres. Telomerase elongation of telomeres is a highly coordinated and tightly regulated process, so that the length of the telomeric repeats is kept within a cell type-specific narrow range from 3 to 20 kb in human cells (17Hug N. Lingner J. Chromosoma.. 2006; 115: 413-425Google Scholar). Telomere homeostasis is maintained by a number of proteins associated with the telomere and/or telomerase. These proteins control the recruitment and accessibility of telomerase to telomeres and regulate telomerase activities at telomeres. Defects in certain proteins, among which are DNA metabolic proteins, have been shown to positively or negatively influence telomere length (18de Lange T. de Lange T. Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Telomeres. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006: 387-431Google Scholar). Several studies in yeast and ciliates have suggested that telomerase-dependent telomere extension is coupled with conventional DNA replication and requires certain DNA replication proteins. For example, inactivation of components of budding yeast DNA replication machinery such as polymerase α (polα), 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN1, flap endonuclease I; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TRAP, telomere repeat amplification protocol; IP, immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRF, terminal restriction fragment; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase. 2The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; FEN1, flap endonuclease I; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; TRAP, telomere repeat amplification protocol; IP, immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRF, terminal restriction fragment; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase. primase, and polymerase δ (polδ) abolishes de novo addition of telomeric DNA by telomerase (19Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Cell.. 1999; 99: 723-733Google Scholar). Certain temperature-sensitive mutations in budding yeast polα or the large subunit of replication factor C cause uncontrolled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation (20Adams Martin A. Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 786-796Google Scholar, 21Adams A.K. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1996; 16: 4614-4620Google Scholar, 22Carson M.J. Hartwell L. Cell.. 1985; 42: 249-257Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, budding yeast polα physically interacts with Cdc13p, a protein that directly interacts with Est1p and regulates telomerase activity at yeast telomeres (23Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev.. 2000; 14: 1777-1788Google Scholar). Similarly, mutations in polα/primase and polδ in fission yeast lead to abnormal lengthening of telomeres, and polα interacts with the telomerase catalytic subunit, Trt1 (24Dahlen M. Sunnerhagen P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 3031-3042Google Scholar). In ciliate Euplotes crassus, it has been demonstrated that telomerase physically interacts with primase and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (25Ray S. Karamysheva Z. Wang L. Shippen D.E. Price C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 5859-5868Google Scholar). Additionally, partial inhibition of polα and polδ by aphidicolin causes C-strand and G-strand telomere heterogeneity in Euplotes (26Fan X. Price C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1997; 8: 2145-2155Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that in lower eukaryotes, telomerase action at telomeres is tightly regulated by activities of DNA replication proteins. However, research in higher eukaryotes on how telomerase couples with conventional DNA replication to maintain telomeres is lacking. The flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is an evolutionarily conserved component of the DNA replication machinery from archaebacteria to humans (27Shen B. Singh P. Liu R. Qiu J. Zheng L. Finger L.D. Alas S. Bioessays.. 2005; 27: 717-729Google Scholar, 28Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2004; 73: 589-615Google Scholar). It is a multifunctional structure-specific nuclease containing flap endonuclease activity (29Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

EMBO J.. 2003; 22: 3451-3460Google Scholar). FEN1 is required for Okazaki fragment processing and maturation during lagging strand DNA synthesis and long patch DNA base excision repair. Its exonuclease activity is important for processing DNA ends during homologous recombination (31Zheng L. Zhou M. Chai Q. Parrish J. Xue D. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Yannone S.M. Chen D. Shen B. EMBO Rep.. 2005; 6: 83-89Google Scholar). Deficiency in FEN1 leads to an increase in genome instability and tumorigenesis (33Zheng L. Dai H. Zhou M. Li M. Singh P. Qiu J. Tsark W. Huang Q. Kernstine K. Zhang X. Lin D. Shen B. Nat. Med.. 2007; 13: 812-819Google Scholar, 34Kucherlapati M. Yang K. Kuraguchi M. Zhao J. Lia M. Heyer J. Kane M.F. Fan K. Russell R. Brown A.M. Kneitz B.

Many cancers have been found to carry somatic mutations in the FEN1 nuclease domain (33Zheng L. Dai H. Zhou M. Li M. Singh P. Qiu J. Tsark W. Huang Q. Kernstine K. Zhang X. Lin D. Shen B. Nat. Med.. 2007; 13: 812-819Google Scholar). Therefore, FEN1 plays a vital role in maintaining genome stability. Several studies have revealed an important role for FEN1 in maintaining telomere integrity. Deletion of FEN1 in yeast results in high telomere instability, characterized by heterogeneous telomere length and a sharp increase in the amount of single-stranded G-overhangs (35Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Google Scholar, 36Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Genetics.. 2002; 162: 1583-1594Google Scholar). In telomerase-negative normal human somatic cells, FEN1 has been shown to associate with telomeres (37Verdun R.E. Karlseder J. Cell.. 2006; 127: 709-720Google Scholar, 38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar). Deficiency in FEN1 leads to loss of telomeres replicated by the lagging strand synthesis (38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar), suggesting that FEN1 is important for a faithful replication of lagging strand telomere DNA. However, it is unknown whether FEN1 is important for regulating telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance in cancer cells. Considering the role of FEN1 in DNA replication and repair, we hypothesized that functional FEN1 might be required for telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance. We now provide the first evidence that FEN1 is in complex with the telomerase catalytic subunit, hTERT. Mammalian cells expressing nuclease-deficient FEN1 displayed increased telomere instability, and FEN1 deficiency induced gradual shortening of telomeres in cancer cells. We propose that FEN1 plays an important role in regulating telomerase activity at telomeres. Cell Culture—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2-mercaptoethanol. All other cells were cultured under similar conditions in a 4:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and medium 199 supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone). Antibodies—The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal anti-FEN1 and mouse anti-actin (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-FEN1 (Bethyl), rabbit polyclonal anti-hTERT (Rockland Inc., it only recognizes exogenously overexpressed hTERT), monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz), monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (BD Biosciences) or anti-rabbit IgG (Bethyl). Construction of Plasmids—Myc tag was added at the N terminus of FEN1 cDNA by PCR cloning. The primers used to amplify FEN1 were 5′-ATC GAT GCTAGC ATG GAA CAA AAA CTC ATC TCA GAA GAG GAT CTG AAT ATG GGA ATT CAA GGC CTG GCC AA-3′ and 5′-CCCGGG TTA TTT TCC CCT TTT AAA CTT C-3′. PCR was performed at 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The DNA product was gel-purified, subjected to NheI and SmaI digestion (sites are underlined), and then cloned into an NheI- and SmaI-digested pCI-neo vector (Promega). The cloned sequences were subjected to DNA sequencing to ensure that no mutations were introduced. Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) Analysis—Nonradioactive TRAP was performed as described (39Chai W. Ford L.P. Lenertz L. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 47242-47247Google Scholar) except that Cy-3-labeled primer was used to replace Cy-5-labeled primer and 28 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) were used to amplify telomerase-extended product. The products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with an FX Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) or a Storm PhosphorImager 860 (GE Healthcare) using a blue laser. Relative telomerase activity was estimated using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) by determining the ratio of the 36-bp internal standard to the 6-bp telomerase-specific ladder. Co-immunoprecipitation-TRAP—Co-IP-TRAP was performed as described (39Chai W. Ford L.P. Lenertz L. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 47242-47247Google Scholar) except that 3 μg of each antibody was coupled to protein A/G+-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by incubating overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. Antibodies were used for IP of proteins from HeLa cell lysate corresponding to 500,000 cells. After IP, the agarose bead pellets were resuspended with lysis buffer in a final volume of 40 μl, and 2 μl (equivalent to 25,000 cells) were used for nonradioactive TRAP analysis to detect telomerase activity. To test the specificity of FEN1·telomerase co-immunoprecipitation, 3 μg of anti-FEN1 blocking peptide (Bethyl) or an irrelevant blocking peptide (which blocks anti-GAPDH and GAPDH interaction but does not block interaction between anti-FEN1 antibody and FEN1 protein) was added to lysate during IP. Co-immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions as follows: 5 μg of pCI-neo vector + 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-hTERT, 5 μg of pCI-neo-Myc-FEN1 + 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-hTERT, 5 μg of pCI-neo vector + 5 μg of pCR3-FLAG-hTERT, or 5 μg of pCI-neo-Myc-FEN1 + 5 μg of pCR3-FLAG-hTERT. The cells were harvested 18 h after transfection, and the cell pellets were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), sonicated on ice (50 J/watt s, three 5-s pulses), and centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C). The resulting supernatants were first precleared by incubating with 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. After brief centrifugation, precleared lysates were transferred to new tubes and used for IP. Anti-Myc (3 μg) antibody was coupled to 20 μl of the 50% slurry of protein G-agarose beads by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Antibody-coated beads were washed once with lysis buffer prior to use in IP reactions. Precleared lysates were treated with or without DNase I (136 units/ml, RNase-free; Roche Applied Science) or RNase A (100 μg/ml, DNase-free; Roche Applied Science) and incubated with antibody-coupled beads in the presence of 50 μg of bovine serum albumin for overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation. The bead pellets were then washed five times with lysis buffer (400 μl for 10 min with rotation at 4 °C), then resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and used immediately on 7% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized for the target sequences of FEN1: GCAGCACAAUGAUGAGUGCTT (siRNA-1) and GCUGCCAAUCCAGGAAUUCTT (siRNA-2). Control siRNA targeted luciferase, and the sequence was CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT. HeLa cells were transfected with 5 nm siRNA with X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection to isolate DNA for TRF analysis and telomere overhang measurement and to isolate protein for immunoblotting. For long term treatment of siRNA, siRNA was transfected to HeLa cells, and transfection was repeated at 3-day intervals. Terminal Restriction Fragment Analysis—Telomere length was determined by TRF analysis as described (40Herbert B. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Analysis of Telomeres and Telomerase. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, 2003: 18.6.1-18.6.6Google Scholar). Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—FISH was performed as described (41Zou Y. Gryaznov S.M. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Cornforth M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2004; 101: 12928-12933Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were enriched in metaphase using colcemid (1 μg/ml, 2 h), trypsinized, and treated with 0.075 m KCl solution, fixed with methanol/acetic acid (3:1), and then dropped on slides. A peptide nucleic acid telomere probe was used to hybridize telomeres as described (2Zou Y. Sfeir A. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2004; 15: 3709-3718Google Scholar). The images were taken with Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. Telomeric G-overhang Measurement—The length of the telomeric G-overhang was measured by telomere overhang protection assay as described (43Chai W. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 2158-2168Google Scholar). Briefly, total DNA (5 μg) in gp32 protection buffer (15 μl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm LiCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2) was treated (37 °C, 30 min) with RNase A (1 μg). The single-stranded DNA was then coated (1 h, room temperature) with single-stranded DNA binding protein T4 gene protein 32 (10 pmol/μl; Roche Applied Science), followed by cross-linking (15 min, room temperature) with 0.025% glutaraldehyde. Cross-linking was stopped by adding 1 m Tris (pH 7.5) to 30 mm. The unprotected double-stranded DNA was digested (37 °C, 30 min) by DNase I (0.04 unit; Roche Applied Science), which was then inactivated (80 °C, 30 min). Protease K (1 μg/μl) and SDS (0.5%) were added, and the samples were incubated (55 °C, overnight) to digest protein and reverse cross-linking. A high specific activity 18-mer C-rich probe (5 fmol) was annealed (room temperature, overnight) to the liberated G-rich overhang. The samples were analyzed the next day on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C with cold 0.5× TBE buffer. The gels were dried on Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare), exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and quantitated by ImageQuant software. To measure the size of the 3′ G-rich overhang, an ExoI-treated sample was used as background, and its signal was subtracted from that of the untreated sample at each measured size interval. The weighted mean size was calculated using the formula: Σ(ODi)/Σ(ODi/Li), where ODi is the PhosphorImager output (signal intensity), and Li is the length in nucleotides of the DNA at position i, using the range of the molecular weight marker standards. FEN1 and Telomerase Co-exist as a Complex in Both Telomerase-positive Tumor Cells and Telomerase-immortalized Human Somatic Cells—To test whether FEN1 is in complex with telomerase in vivo, we first used a polyclonal anti-FEN1 antibody to pull down telomerase from HeLa cell extracts. Following IP, the precipitates were subjected to TRAP analysis for detection of telomerase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, FEN1 antibody precipitated telomerase activity, measured as TRAP activity, similar to an hTERT antibody (lanes 5 and 6), indicating that FEN1 was in complex with telomerase in vivo. Neither the rabbit IgG nor a control antibody to ribosomal release factor precipitated telomerase (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with the polyclonal anti-FEN1 antibody confirmed that the antibody was specific for FEN1 protein (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the addition of a peptide that blocks the anti-FEN1 antibody completely inhibited IP of FEN1, as shown by Western blot analysis of precipitates (Fig. 1B, lane 5), whereas a control peptide (blocking peptide for anti-GAPDH antibody) did not have any effect on anti-FEN1 recognition. Accordingly, minimal TRAP activity was detected in the precipitate when FEN1 blocking peptide was present (Fig. 1A, lane 7), whereas the control blocking peptide had no effect on the amount of telomerase precipitated by FEN1 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that co-immunoprecipitation of FEN1 with telomerase was specific. To test whether FEN1 was in complex with telomerase in other cell lines, we carried out the co-IP-TRAP using telomerase-positive cancer cell lines BT20, MCF7, and H1299. Anti-FEN1 antibody also precipitated telomerase activity in these cells (Fig. 1C). Normal human somatic cells such as BJ foreskin fibroblasts and IMR90 lung fibroblasts contain undetectable telomerase activity because of the low expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, hTERT. Ectopically overexpressing hTERT in BJ and IMR90 make them telomerase-positive. As shown in Fig. 1C, anti-hFEN1 antibody precipitated telomerase activity in BJ/hTERT and IMR90/hTERT as well. Therefore, human FEN1 forms a complex with telomerase in both telomerase-positive cancer cells and hTERT-expressing normal somatic cells. FEN1 Is in Complex with hTERT Independent of hTR but Dependent on DNA—Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein containing an RNA subunit (human telomerase RNA) and a catalytic protein subunit (hTERT). We next investigated the potential association of FEN1 with the hTERT subunit. We first co-transfected Myc-tagged full-length FEN1 with untagged full-length hTERT into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation of Myc-FEN1 with anti-Myc coupled agarose beads also pulled down hTERT (Fig. 2A, lane 6), whereas hTERT was not precipitated from cells transfected with hTERT and the empty vector (Fig. 2A, lane 4). To further test the specificity of the FEN1/hTERT association, we co-expressed Myc-FEN1 and FLAG-tagged hTERT. Immunoprecipitation of Myc-FEN1 with anti-Myc-coupled agarose beads also pulled down FLAG-hTERT (Fig. 2B, lane 4), whereas FLAG-hTERT was not precipitated from cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Together, these results strongly supported our observation that FEN1 was specifically in complex with telomerase (Fig. 1). Because the telomerase complex is composed of two subunits, hTERT and human telomerase RNA, we tested the possibility that the physical interaction between FEN1 and hTERT might be mediated by the telomerase RNA subunit. Treatment of cell extracts with RNase A prior to IP removed cellular RNA, as shown by the disappearance of 28, 16, and 5 S ribosomal RNA bands analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2D, lane 3). No significant reduction in the Myc-FEN1/hTERT interaction was detected (Fig. 2C, lane 2), suggesting that that the RNA component of telomerase was dispensable for the FEN1 telomerase complex. FEN1 associates with telomere DNA during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle in telomerase-negative human fibroblasts (37Verdun R.E. Karlseder J. Cell.. 2006; 127: 709-720Google Scholar). To test whether FEN1 telomerase complex might be bridged by telomere DNA, cell extracts were treated with DNase I to remove DNA prior to IP, as shown by the disappearance of the genomic DNA smear (as cell extracts were sonicated during lysis, the genomic DNA was sheared to small sizes) (Fig. 2D, lane 1). Removal of DNA abolished the ability of Myc-FEN1 to precipitate hTERT (Fig. 2C, lane 1), suggesting that FEN1 and hTERT might associate indirectly through telomere DNA. FEN1 Deficiency Leads to Telomere Instability in MEFs—Telomeres become dysfunctional when they cannot be maintained properly. Dysfunctional telomeres are recognized as damaged DNA, triggering a DNA damage response, which then leads to DNA repair at telomeres via a nonhomologous end joining pathway. We hypothesized that functional FEN1 might be essential for telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance, and deficiency in FEN1 might encumber telomerase elongation at short telomeres, leading to telomere dysfunction. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed telomere stability in MEFs carrying a FEN1 point mutation (E160D) that eliminated FEN1 exonuclease and gap-dependent endonuclease activities (33Zheng L. Dai H. Zhou M. Li M. Singh P. Qiu J. Tsark W. Huang Q. Kernstine K. Zhang X. Lin D. Shen B. Nat. Med.. 2007; 13: 812-819Google Scholar). E160D knock-in mice show a dramatic increase in spontaneous mutation rates and cancer incidences (33Zheng L. Dai H. Zhou M. Li M. Singh P. Qiu J. Tsark W. Huang Q. Kernstine K. Zhang X. Lin D. Shen B. Nat. Med.. 2007; 13: 812-819Google Scholar). When we analyzed telomere stability using FISH analysis, we found that the E160D MEFs displayed a significant increase of telomere end-to-end fusions compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3), suggesting that the exonuclease and gap-dependent endonuclease activities of FEN1 were important for maintaining telomere stability. FEN1 Deficiency Induces Telomere Shortening in Telomerase-positive Cancer Cells—To test our hypothesis that functional FEN1 may be needed for telomerase-mediated telomere maintenance in human telomerase-positive cells, we determined whether telomere maintenance was affected by the reduction of FEN1 expression. One time RNA interference knockdown of FEN1 in telomerase-positive cells did not induce telomere dysfunction, as determined by telomere length measurement, FISH analysis, and γ-H2AX foci staining at dysfunctional telomeres (data not shown). This could have been due to transient protein reduction induced by short term gene knockdown. We then repeatedly treated HeLa cells with FEN1 siRNA at 3-day intervals for 4 weeks. The same method has been used to study the role of replication factor origin recognition complex in telomere maintenance (44Deng Z. Dheekollu J. Broccoli D. Dutta A. Lieberman P.M. Curr. Biol.. 2007; 17: 1989-1995Google Scholar). Quantitation of Western blot revealed that about 90–95% endogenous FEN1 protein was depleted during the course of repetitive RNA interference treatment (Fig. 4A). About 2 weeks after the initial RNA interference treatment, cells treated with FEN1 siRNA showed retarded cell growth compared with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4B). We repeated the FEN1 knockdown experiment and found similar effects of siFEN1 on cell growth (Fig. 4B). Measurement of telomere length by TRF analysis revealed gradually shortened telomeres over this long term treatment (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that telomerase elongation of telomeres was hampered by FEN1 deficiency. FEN1 Deficiency Did Not Alter Telomere Structure—Telomeres can form a special nucleo-protein structure called t-loop to protect chromosome stability. This structure is formed by inserting the single-stranded G-overhang at the 3′ end of the telomere back into the double-stranded telomere DNA region. Failure to maintain the protective t-loop structure leads to telomere instability (45Hockemeyer D. Sfeir A.J. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. de Lange T. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 2667-2678Google Scholar, 46Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science.. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Google Scholar). In budding yeast, deficiency in FEN1/Rad27 leads to accumulation of G-overhangs (35Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Google Scholar, 36Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Genetics.. 2002; 162: 1583-1594Google Scholar), which is thought to deregulate telomerase action and cause abnormal telomere shortening and lengthening (35Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Google Scholar). To test whether telomere instability caused by FEN1 deficiency in cancer cells might be due to the alteration in telomere structure, we determined whether the G-overhang is altered by FEN1 deficiency. Western blotting showed that two siRNAs targeting different coding regions of FEN1 reduced protein expression by 90 and 84%, respectively (Fig. 5A). Genomic DNA was then isolated from FEN1-depleted HeLa cells and subjected to telomere overhang protection assay for measurement of G-overhang length (Fig. 5B) (43Chai W. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 2158-2168Google Scholar, 47Chai W. Du Q. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 427-435Google Scholar). We failed to observe any alteration in telomeric G-overhangs upon FEN1 depletion (Fig. 5, C and D). Use of a nondenaturing in-gel hybridization assay (48Dionne I. Wellinger R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 93: 13902-13907Google Scholar) to estimate the relative abundance of G-overhang also showed no change in G-overhang abundance (data not shown). Taken together, we concluded that FEN1 deficiency was unlikely to alter telomere structure. FEN1 is a multifunctional nuclease that plays a role in DNA replication and DNA repair. It associates with telomeres and interacts with telomere-binding proteins TRF2 and the Werner protein (WRN) (38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar, 49Muftuoglu M. Wong H.K. Imam S.Z. Wilson III, D.M. Bohr V.A. Opresko P.L. Cancer Res.. 2006; 66: 113-124Google Scholar, 50Sharma S. Sommers J.A. Wu L. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 9847-9856Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed its role in maintaining telomere stability in telomerase-positive cancer cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, we have demonstrated that FEN1 is in complex with telomerase (Figs. 1 and 2). Further analysis shows that this physical connection between FEN1 and telomerase is dependent on the presence of telomere DNA but does not require the RNA component of telomerase (Fig. 2), indicating that the FEN1 may indirectly interact with telomerase through telomere DNA. This finding is consistent with previous reports that FEN1 is localized at telomeres (37Verdun R.E. Karlseder J. Cell.. 2006; 127: 709-720Google Scholar, 38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar). We further show that a loss of FEN1 nuclease activity in MEFs causes an increase in telomere end-to-end fusions (Fig. 3), suggesting that FEN1 nuclease activity is critical for telomere stability. Furthermore, knocking down FEN1 in telomerase-positive cancer cells induces gradual telomere shortening and retarded cell growth (Fig. 4). These data strongly suggest that FEN1 may regulate telomerase activity at telomeres and that dysfunction of FEN1 may cause failure of proper telomere maintenance by telomerase. Our results further emphasize the important roles of DNA replication machinery in regulating telomerase action at telomeres. Telomerase elongation of telomeres is tightly regulated by various telomere-binding proteins and proteins involved in DNA repair, replication, and recombination. Deficiency in these proteins causes deregulation of telomerase action, leading to abnormal telomere shortening or lengthening. The first step during telomerase extension of telomeres is the extension of G-strands. The complementary C-strands are then filled in by the lagging strand replication machinery. Analyses in yeast and ciliates have suggested that extension of G-strand by telomerase is regulated by C-strand synthesis. When C-strand synthesis is partially inhibited by a specific inhibitor of polα and polδ, new synthesis on both C- and G-strands becomes deregulated, leading to heterogeneous length of both C- and G-strands (26Fan X. Price C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1997; 8: 2145-2155Google Scholar). This suggests that there is a highly coordinated action of C-strand synthesis mediated by the lagging strand synthesis machinery and G-strand synthesis mediated by telomerase. Although the precise mechanism for this coordinative regulation is unclear, several studies have revealed close physical interaction between the replication machinery and telomerase, suggesting that this interaction may regulate telomerase elongation of telomeres. For example, fission yeast polα and telomerase catalytic subunit Trt1 co-exist in a complex in vivo (24Dahlen M. Sunnerhagen P. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 3031-3042Google Scholar). Similarly, in ciliate E. crassus, it has been demonstrated that primase and proliferating cell nuclear antigen form a complex with telomerase (25Ray S. Karamysheva Z. Wang L. Shippen D.E. Price C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2002; 22: 5859-5868Google Scholar). In budding yeast, two-hybrid analysis has shown that DNA replication factor polα interacts with Cdc13p, a protein that directly interacts with Est1p and regulates telomerase activity at yeast telomeres (23Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev.. 2000; 14: 1777-1788Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that FEN1 and telomerase co-exist in a complex in human cells, suggesting that the physical connection between the lagging strand replication complexes with telomerase may be evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. We propose that this physical connection is perhaps one of the mechanisms regulating telomerase extension of telomeres. Disruption of the physical link between DNA replication proteins with telomerase may uncouple C-strand synthesis from telomerase-guided G-strand extension, leading to defects in telomere maintenance. The single-stranded G-overhang at the 3′ end of the telomere is essential for the formation of the special t-loop structure. Deficiency in G-overhang generation is expected to disrupt the t-loop structure and further lead to telomere instability. Because the G-overhang is the binding site for telomerase, deficiency in G-overhang generation is also expected to hamper telomerase elongation of telomeres. Several studies have suggested that G-overhangs are generated by extensive but tightly regulated enzymatic processing events at the C-strand following telomere replication (45Hockemeyer D. Sfeir A.J. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. de Lange T. EMBO J.. 2005; 24: 2667-2678Google Scholar, 47Chai W. Du Q. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 427-435Google Scholar, 51Sfeir A.J. Chai W. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Mol. Cell.. 2005; 18: 131-138Google Scholar), even though the nuclease(s) has not been identified. FEN1 is a multifunctional nuclease containing endonuclease activity and 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity and is therefore among the candidate exonucleases responsible for processing the blunt-ended telomeres left after leading strand synthesis (42Ohki R. Tsurimoto T. Ishikawa F. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2001; 21: 5753-5766Google Scholar, 52Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor. Biol.. 1973; 41: 181-190Google Scholar, 53Lingner J. Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science.. 1995; 269: 1533-1534Google Scholar). Increasing evidence suggests that FEN1 is unlikely to be the nuclease-processing telomere ends but rather in Okazaki fragment processing at lagging daughter telomeres. If FEN1 were the nuclease-processing telomere ends, FEN1 deficiency would leave leading strand telomeres blunt-ended after replication. In this case, we would expect that these blunt-ended DNA would be recognized as DNA double-strand breaks and be repaired by DNA repair machinery. Because half of telomeres are replicated by leading strand synthesis, we would also expect telomere instabilities on half of the chromosomes. However, the nuclease-deficient FEN1 revealed telomere end-to-end fusions at only a subset of chromosomes (Fig. 3). In support of our data, it has been reported that about 8% of chromosomes lose their telomeres when FEN1 is depleted (38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar). All of the affected telomeres are replicated by lagging strand synthesis, whereas telomeres replicated by leading stranded synthesis are unaffected (38Saharia A. Guittat L. Crocker S. Lim A. Steffen M. Kulkarni S. Stewart S.A. Curr. Biol.. 2008; 18: 496-500Google Scholar). In addition, deficiency in budding yeast FEN1/Rad27p actually leads to accumulation of G-overhangs at the lagging daughter telomeres, whereas leading daughter telomere ends are normally processed (35Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Google Scholar, 36Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Genetics.. 2002; 162: 1583-1594Google Scholar). It was interpreted that in the absence of FEN1/Rad27p, inappropriate Okazaki fragment processing might cause excessive dissociation or degradation of the last primer (perhaps by other nucleases), leading to an increase of single-stranded DNA of the template strand, i.e. G-strand (35Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1999; 19: 4143-4152Google Scholar, 36Parenteau J. Wellinger R.J. Genetics.. 2002; 162: 1583-1594Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that FEN1 is unlikely to be the nuclease responsible for processing telomere ends, although we cannot rule out the possibility that there may be other nuclease(s) with functions redundant to those of FEN1. In summary, we provide the first evidence that human FEN1 protein is in complex with telomerase and regulates telomerase activity at telomeres. Together with the demonstration by others that FEN1 is localized at telomeres and affects lagging strand telomere replication, our results suggest that, similar to what has been noted in yeast and ciliates, telomerase in human cells is likely to coordinate with the lagging strand replication machinery to ensure proper telomere length control. Understanding the regulatory mechanism for this coordination will aid us in understanding the mechanisms of telomere maintenance and facilitate telomerase-based cancer therapy. We thank L.

In budding yeast, Sgt1 and Hsp90 help assemble the core kinetochore complex CBF3 by activating the CBF3 components Skp1 and Ctf13. In this study, we show that Sgt1 forms homodimers by performing in vitro and in vivo immunoprecipitation and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses. Analyses of the dimerization of Sgt1 deletion proteins showed that the Skp1-binding domain (amino acids 1–211) contains the Sgt1 homodimerization domain. Also, the Sgt1 mutant proteins that were unable to dimerize also did not bind Skp1, suggesting that Sgt1 dimerization is important for Sgt1-Skp1 binding. Restoring dimerization activity of a dimerization-deficient sgt1 mutant (sgt1-L31P) by using the CENP-B (centromere protein-B) dimerization domain suppressed the temperature sensitivity, the benomyl sensitivity, and the chromosome missegregation phenotype of sgt1-L31P.

These results strongly suggest that Sgt1 dimerization is required for kinetochore assembly. Spindle microtubules are coupled to the centromeric region of the chromosome by a structural protein complex called the kinetochore (1Cheeseman I.M. Desai A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.. 2008; 9: 33-46Google Scholar, 2Westermann S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2007; 76: 563-591Google Scholar). The kinetochore is thought to generate a signal that arrests cells during mitosis when it is not properly attached to microtubules, thereby preventing aberrant chromosome transmission to the daughter cells, which can lead to tumorigenesis (3Sudakin V. Yen T.J. BioDrugs.. 2007; 21: 225-233Google Scholar, 4Weaver B.A. Silk A.D. Montagna C. Verdier-Pinard P. Cleveland D.W. Cancer Cell.. 2007; 11: 25-36Google Scholar). The kinetochore of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been characterized thoroughly, genetically and biochemically; thus, its molecular structure is the most well detailed to date. More than 70 different proteins comprise the budding yeast kinetochore, and several of those are conserved in mammals (2Westermann S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2007; 76: 563-591Google Scholar). The budding yeast centromere DNA is a 125-bp region that contains three conserved regions, CDEI, CDEII, and CDEIII (5Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Clarke L.

CDEIII (25 bp) is essential for centromere function (10Hegemann J.H. Shero J.H. Cottarel G. Philippsen P. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.

Lechner J. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 3611-3620Google Scholar), all of which are essential for viability. Mutations in any of the four CBF3 proteins abolish the ability of CDEIII to bind to CBF3 (19Sorger P.K. Doheny K.F. Hieter P. Kopski K.M. Huffaker T.C. Hyman A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All of the described kinetochore proteins, except the CDEI-binding Cbf1, localize to kinetochores dependent on the CBF3 complex (2Westermann S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2007; 76: 563-591Google Scholar). Therefore, the CBF3 complex is the fundamental structure of the kinetochore, and the mechanism of CBF3 assembly is of major interest. We previously isolated SGT1, the skp1-4 kinetochore-defective mutant dosage suppressor (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). Sgt1 and Skp1 activate Ctf13; thus, they are required for assembly of the CBF3 complex (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is also required for the formation of the Skp1-Ctf13 complex (22Stemmann O. Neidig A. Kocher T. Wilm M. Lechner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 8585-8590Google Scholar). Sgt1 has two highly conserved motifs that are required for protein-protein interaction, the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) 2The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GA, geldanamycin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; DD, dimerization domain; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide. (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar) and the CS (CHORD protein- and Sgt1-specific) motif. We and others (23Azevedo C. Sadanandom A. Kitagawa K. Freialdenhoven A. Shirasu K. Schulze-Lefert P. Science.. 2002; 295: 2073-2076Google Scholar, 24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell.

Biol.. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Google Scholar) have found that both domains are important for the interaction with Hsp90. The Sgt1-Hsp90 interaction is required for the assembly of the core kinetochore complex; this interaction is an initial step in kinetochore assembly (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar, 26Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Google Scholar, 27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol.

Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 4133-4146Google Scholar, 29Steensgaard P. Garre M. Muradore I. Transidico P. Nigg E.A. Kitagawa K. Earnshaw W.C. Faretta M. Musacchio A. EMBO Rep.. 2004; 5: 626-631Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the molecular mechanism of this assembly process. We found that Sgt1 forms dimers in vivo, and our results strongly suggest that Sgt1 dimerization is required for kinetochore assembly in budding yeast. Yeast Strains and Medium—Supplemental Table I lists the genotypes of yeast strains used in this study. The medium for yeast growth and sporulation was described previously (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1990Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed according to the method described by Ito et al. (31Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol.. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). Strains that expressed tagged proteins were generated according to the procedure of Longtine et al. (32Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast.. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Regions that encoded the Myc tags were inserted at the 3′ end of the endogenous locus. Plasmid Construction and Primers—Supplemental Table II lists the plasmids used in this study. Details about their construction (33Kitagawa K. Abdulle R. BioTechniques.. 2002; 33: 288-294Google Scholar) and primer sequences are available upon request. Antibodies—Anti-Skp1, anti-Sgt1, and anti-Hsp82 antibodies were described previously (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol.

Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) and anti-Myc (Roche Applied Science), anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST; Abcam), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-His6 (Qiagen) antibodies were purchased from the indicated sources. Protein Expression and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation using yeast lysates was performed as described previously (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar). Expression and purification of His6-Sgt1 and GST-Sgt1 proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described previously (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were carried out in a ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with cells containing sapphire or quartz windows and charcoal-filled Epon double-sector center pieces (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The software SEDNTERP was used to convert the sedimentation coefficients to standard conditions (20 °C, water as solvent, and zero concentration protein), and noted as s2O,wO values, as well as for the calculation of the density and viscosity of the buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and partial specific volume and molecular mass of the protein (35Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Equilibrium as well as velocity data were analyzed with SEDFIT and SEDPHAT software. Sedimentation equilibrium was attained at 24 h at a temperature of 4 °C at increasing rotor speeds of 16,000–30,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were 1.75–17.0 μm (120 μl), and absorbance distributions were recorded at 280 nm. Modeling was performed at multiple rotor speeds using a monomer-dimer self-association model (36Vistica J. Dam J. Balbo A. Yikilmaz E. Mariuzza R.A. Rouault T.A. Schuck P. Anal. Biochem.. 2004; 326: 234-256Google Scholar). For the sedimentation velocity experiments, the loading volume was 360 μl (2.2 mg/ml), and the protein was centrifuged at 20 °C at 60,000 rpm. Fringe displacement data at time intervals of 1.0 min were collected with the Rayleigh interference system for 12 h and analyzed using the models for continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution (c(s)) as well as the hybrid continuous/discrete distribution (37Schuck P. Biophys. J.. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar, 38Schuck P. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2005: 26-50Google Scholar, 39Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J.. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Google Scholar). The latter model was with two discrete species, one with a best fit apparent molar mass of 41 kDa and an s value of 3.85 S and a second species constrained to the molar mass of the dimer, 98.4 kDa, with a fixed s value of 4.70 S. In Vitro Binding Assay Using the Hsp90 Inhibitor Geldanamycin (GA)—40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) was preincubated with either DMSO or geldanamycin for 30 min. Proteins were synthesized in the in vitro transcription and translation reaction of a 50-μl volume containing GA/DMSO-treated reticulocyte lysate, 0.02 mm methionine, and 800 ng of PCR-amplified DNA encoding FLAG-Sgt1 or HA-Sgt1 in the separate reactions and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. HA-Sgt1 and FLAG-Sgt1 were mixed together with 300 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was immunoprecipitated with 30 μl of anti-HA cross-linked beads and incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed five times with Buffer A, and eluted in 30 μl of 2× gel loading buffer. Proteins were detected by Western blotting using tag-specific antibodies. HA-Skp1 used in the Skp1-Sgt1 binding reaction was expressed in baculovirus and was also pretreated with the same amount of DMSO or GA as used in the Sgt1-Sgt1 binding reaction. Association of Sgt1 with Itself in Budding Yeast—In a two-hybrid analysis to further investigate the function of Sgt1, we discovered that Sgt1 interacts with itself (supplemental Fig. S1A). To confirm this interaction in vivo, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay using yeast strains expressing Sgt1-Myc and HA-Sgt1. HA-Sgt1 was detected specifically in precipitates of Sgt1-Myc but not in untagged Sgt1 control precipitations (Fig. 1A), and Sgt1-Myc was detected in precipitates of HA-Sgt1 but not in untagged control precipitations (supplemental Fig. S1B; data not shown). These results indicate that Sgt1 associates with itself in vivo. Sgt1 Dimerization in Vitro—Next, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation by using bacterially expressed and purified His6-Sgt1. The monomer-dimer self-association model was used in the analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium data of Sgt1 (Fig. 1B). From these best fits, the dissociation equilibrium constant for Sgt1 was determined as 20 nm (strong dimerization). Thus, at an arbitrary concentration of 10 μm (500-fold higher in concentration than its dimer dissociation equilibrium constant of 20 nm), Sgt1 exists as a dimer in solution. The sedimentation velocity data, c(s) distribution, of Sgt1 show that it exists as a dimer in solution with a molar mass of ∼98.5 kDa (theoretical molar mass of 98,432 Da) (Fig. 1C). The s2O,wO value is 4.75 S, larger than the maximum theoretical value of 4.01 S for a monomer (data not shown). The frictional ratio is 1.62, which indicates that this dimer is elongated and extended in shape (data not shown). The second largest peak (s value of 3.85 S) in the c(s) distribution does not appear to be the monomer but a contaminant species with a molar mass of ∼41 kDa (data not shown). The data could not be fitted to a rapid monomer-dimer self-association model. Better fits were obtained with the hybrid continuous/discrete distribution model where this 41-kDa contaminant species was taken into account and comprised of no more than 10% of total protein. The existence of a dimer for Sgt1 was confirmed with this model. Binding of the N-terminal Domain of Sgt1 to Sgt1—Previous analyses of amino acid sequences revealed that Sgt1 has three conserved domains, viz. the TRP domain, the CS domain, and the SGS (Sgt1-specific sequence) domain (Fig. 2B). The TPR domain is located at the N-terminal end (amino acids 13–141) and contains TPR motifs that are homologous (27% similarity) to those of HOP (Sti1 in budding yeast), an Hsp90-Hsp70-organizing protein (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). The CS motif (amino acids 184–279) is homologous (18% similarity) to a domain in the co-chaperone p23 (25Dubacq C. Guerois R. Courbeyrette R. Kitagawa K. Mann C. Eukaryot. Cell.. 2002; 1: 568-582Google Scholar, 40Garcia-Ranea J.A. Mirey G. Camonis J. Valencia A. FEBS Lett.. 2002; 529: 162-167Google Scholar). Previously, we reported (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar) that in vitro, two of three repeats of the TPR domain and a short part (amino acids 184–211) of the CS domain are required for Sgt1 binding to Skp1 and that the full-length TPR domain and a short part (amino acids 184–211) of the CS domain are required for Sgt1 binding to Hsc82 (Fig. 2B). We performed immunoprecipitation experiments by using truncated Sgt1 proteins to identify the domains that participate in the Sgt1-Sgt1 association. Various deletion proteins (Fig. 2, A and B) were expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine by an in vitro translation system, and the reticulocyte lysates that contained the deletion proteins were mixed with a protein extract that contained HA-Sgt1 that had been expressed separately. HA-Sgt1 was immunoprecipitated by using Sepharose to which anti-HA antibodies were conjugated (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the binding activity of the deletion proteins revealed that the N-terminal region that contained the TPR domain (amino acids 1–182) bound to Sgt1 substantially (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1D). Deletion of amino acids 1–58 reduced binding to Sgt1 substantially (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1D). Thus, we conclude that the full-length TPR domain is required for Sgt1 binding to Sgt1 (Fig. 2B). The N-terminal region that contained the TPR domain (amino acids 1–182) bound to Sgt1 but not to Skp1 or Hsc82 (Fig. 2B). The finding that the Sgt1-binding domain overlaps the Skp1-binding and Hsp90-binding domains but is 29 amino acids shorter than both (Fig. 2B) suggests that Sgt1 first forms dimers and then binds to Skp1 and Hsp90. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding that Sgt1 can form dimers efficiently by itself. Next, we examined whether these N-terminal polypeptides can form homodimers. The N-terminal region that consisted of amino acids 1–211 formed homodimers, but a shorter region (amino acids 1–182) did not (Fig. 2C). Also, the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–211) did not associate with the C-terminal region (amino acids 284–395) (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the N-terminal end of Sgt1 binds to the N-terminal end of another Sgt1 protein. Effect of Hsp90 on Sgt1 Dimerization—By using purified human Hsp90 protein, we previously showed that Hsp90 binding to Sgt1 is required for Sgt1 binding to Skp1 in vitro (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Hsp90 helps Sgt1 dimerization or dissociation. In the present study, we used MBP-fused yeast Hsp90 protein (MBP-Hsp82) (26Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Google Scholar) and confirmed the previous results. Indeed, MBP-Hsp82 stimulated Sgt1 binding to GST-Skp1 in vitro (Fig. 3A). Using the same proteins, we examined whether Hsp90 stimulates the formation or dissociation of Sgt1 dimers. We found that MBP-Hsp82 moderately stimulates (but does not inhibit) the association between His6-Sgt1 and GST-Sgt1 (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the molecular ratio of Skp1 to Sgt1 is ∼1:2 (1:2.18), supporting the model that the Sgt1 dimer binds to Skp1. In the in vitro translation system using reticulocyte lysates (presumably including abundant Hsp90), we found that GA, an Hsp90 inhibitor, substantially inhibits Sgt1-Skp1 association but not Sgt1 dimerization (Fig. 3C). These results strongly suggest that Hsp90 is required for binding of Sgt1 to Skp1 but not Sgt1 itself. Next, we examined the role of Hsp90 in Sgt1 dimerization in vivo. In hsp82 temperature-sensitive mutant cells at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C), Sgt1 binding to Skp1 was substantially reduced, but Sgt1 binding to Sgt1 was not significantly affected (Fig. 3D). Note that the association of Sgt1 and Skp1 was not altered in wild-type strains at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S1E, left) and that the Hsp82 mutant protein was not reduced at the nonpermissive temperature (supplemental Fig. S1E, right). These results indicate that Hsp82 is required for Sgt1 binding to Skp1 but not for generating Sgt1 dimers in vivo. Importance of the Three Repeats in the TPR to Sgt1 Dimerization and Skp1 Binding—The sgt1-3 cells, which undergo arrest in G2/M phases at the nonpermissive temperature, exhibit a chromosome missegregation phenotype (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). The CBF3 complex fails to form in sgt1-3 cells, and the Sgt1-3 protein cannot bind to Skp1 (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). A functionally different sgt1 mutant called sgt1-5 undergoes arrest in the G1 phase at the nonpermissive temperature and is deficient in SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) ubiquitin ligase activity and activated adenylyl cyclase (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar, 25Dubacq C. Guerois R. Courbeyrette R. Kitagawa K. Mann C. Eukaryot. Cell.. 2002; 1: 568-582Google Scholar). We found that Sgt1-3 protein cannot bind to Sgt1-3 protein in vivo (Fig. 4A), although Sgt1-5 protein can bind to Sgt1-5 protein (Fig. 4A). Three missense mutations are present in sgt1-3: L31P, F99L, and N213I. The first two are in the TPR domain (Fig. 4B). Previously, Lingelbach and Kaplan (26Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Google Scholar) showed that the N213I mutation does not contribute to the kinetochore defects in sgt1-3 mutants. Therefore, we tested whether the L31P or F99L mutant protein can form dimers. Interestingly, the L31P mutant protein did not bind to Sgt1 or Skp1 (Fig. 4C), and the F99L mutant protein bound to Sgt1 and Skp1 weakly (Fig. 4C). The other kinetochore-defective alleles, sgt1-7 and sgt1-12, have missense mutations; L117P and Q191K occur in sgt1-7, and A74T and I151V occur in sgt1-12. To address the importance of all three repeats in the TPR domain (Fig. 4B), we examined whether the A67Y, L117P, or A74T mutant protein can form homodimers (note that Ala-67 and Ala-74 are conserved in Sti1, a typical TPR protein) (Fig. 4B). The dimerization of the A67Y mutant protein and that of the A74T mutant protein were reduced, and that of the L117P mutant protein was substantially reduced (Fig. 4C). Catlett and Kaplan (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Google Scholar) reported that the second repeat in the TPR domain is not necessary for binding to Skp1 because the A67Y mutant protein is able to bind to Skp1 in vitro. However, we found that the A67Y mutant protein is not able to associate efficiently with itself or with Skp1 in vivo (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggest that all three TPR repeats in the TPR domain are important for Sgt1 dimerization and Skp1 binding. Role of Dimerization in the Restoration of Defects in the sgt1-3 Mutant—To directly confirm the importance of the Sgt1-Sgt1 association for the essential function of Sgt1, we fused the 59-amino acid dimerization domain of human CENP-B (41Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Google Scholar) to the N-terminal end of the L31P mutant protein. The CENP-B dimerization domain (DD) is sufficient to form dimers (41Kitagawa K. Masumoto H. Ikeda M. Okazaki T. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 1995; 15: 1602-1612Google Scholar). CENP-B is not conserved in budding yeast; thus, its dimerization domain is not relevant to kinetochore function in budding yeast. We confirmed by immunoprecipitation that the CENP-B-DD-L31P mutant protein forms dimers in vivo (Fig. 5A). Indeed, restoring dimerization activity by using CENP-B-DD suppressed the temperature sensitivity of sgt1-L31P (Fig. 5B), the benomyl sensitivity of sgt1-L31P (Fig. 5C), and the chromosome missegregation phenotype of sgt1-L31P (Fig. 5D). These results strongly support the hypothesis that Sgt1 dimerization is required for the protein's function in kinetochore assembly. In this study, we have shown that Sgt1 forms homodimers. Analyses of Sgt1 domains revealed that the N-terminal domain, which includes TPR motifs, binds to Sgt1 itself. Further analyses suggested that the dimerization of Sgt1 is important for kinetochore assembly. On the basis of this work, we have developed a model in which CBF assembly is regulated by Sgt1 and Hsp90. Updated Model of CBF3 Assembly—Recombinant purified Sgt1 forms dimers efficiently in vitro. The dimerization domain is a little smaller than the Skp1-binding and Hsp90-binding domains. These results suggest that Sgt1 forms homodimers before it binds to other proteins in vivo. By activating Ctf13, Sgt1, together with Skp1, is required for the formation of the CBF3 complex (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). Hsp90 is also required for the formation of the Skp1-Ctf13 complex (22Stemmann O. Neidig A. Kocher T. Wilm M. Lechner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2002; 99: 8585-8590Google Scholar). Previously, we and others (24Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Google Scholar, 26Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Google Scholar) showed that the Sgt1-Hsp90 complex is required for the formation of the CBF3 complex. Here, our results suggest that Sgt1 first forms dimers. Next, Sgt1 binds to Hsc82 to form the proper structure for binding to Skp1, and by binding to Skp1, Sgt1 activates the Skp1-Ctf13 complex for the subsequent formation of the CBF3 complex (42Russell I.D. Grancell A.S. Sorger P.K. J. Cell Biol.. 1999; 145: 933-950Google Scholar). Skp1 can form a complex with Sgt1 and an F-box protein (e.g. Ctf13) (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar). Because Sgt1 is not in the CBF3 complex (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar), Sgt1 is expected to dissociate from the complex after assembly. Necessity of the TPR Domain in Sgt1 Dimerization—Of the three conserved Sgt1 domains, we found that the N-terminal TPR domain is required for dimerization. Our in vivo analyses of sgt1 mutants that carry mutations in the TPR domain strongly suggested that all three TPR motifs are important for Sgt1 dimerization and Skp1 binding. Catlett and Kaplan (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Google Scholar) showed that, like wild-type protein, the Sgt1-A67Y protein binds to GST-Skp1 in vitro, and they concluded that the second TPR is not important for Skp1 binding. However, we found that in vivo, Sgt1-A67Y does not bind to itself very efficiently or to Skp1 at all. We believe that this difference in binding is explained by the difference between in vitro and in vivo conditions. Consistent with our result showing that Sgt1-A67Y does not bind to Skp1, a mutation at another conserved residue in the second TPR (A74T) reduced dimerization and abolished Skp1 binding. These results suggest that, at least in vivo, the second TPR motif also contributes to Skp1 binding. Hsp90 Is Not Essential for Generating Sgt1 Dimers in Vivo—Although we found that Hsp90 stimulates Sgt1 dimerization moderately in vitro, Sgt1 forms dimers efficiently in hsp90 mutant lysates in which Sgt1 does not substantially bind to Skp1. Also, in the in vitro translation system using reticulocyte lysates, geldanamycin inhibits binding of Sgt1 to Skp1 but does not inhibit Sgt1 dimerization. Therefore, it is likely that Hsp90 stimulates the Sgt1 dimer to bind to Skp1. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the existence of a redundant pathway that stimulates Sgt1 dimerization when Hsp90 fails in vivo. Further studies are required to address this issue. Kinetochore Function of Human SGT1—Human SGT1A can rescue the yeast sgt1-null mutant (21Kitagawa K. Skowyra D. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Hieter P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 21-33Google Scholar), a result that suggests that the function of Sgt1 is conserved between humans and yeast. SGT1 associates with HSP90 in human and yeast cells (28Niikura Y. Ohta S. Vandenbeldt K.J. Abdulle R. McEwen B.F. Kitagawa K. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 4133-4146Google Scholar, 43Lee Y.T. Jacob J. Michowski W. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. Chazin W.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 16511-16517Google Scholar). Interestingly, Steensgaard et al. (29Steensgaard P. Garre M. Muradore I. Transidico P. Nigg E.A. Kitagawa K. Earnshaw W.C. Faretta M. Musacchio A. EMBO Rep.. 2004; 5: 626-631Google Scholar) and Niikura et al. (28Niikura Y. Ohta S. Vandenbeldt K.J. Abdulle R. McEwen B.F. Kitagawa K. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 4133-4146Google Scholar) found that CENP-I, CENP-F, and Hec1, but not CENP-C, are absent from kinetochores in human cells depleted of SGT1 or HSP90 or treated with 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (an HSP90 inhibitor). This absence suggests that the human SGT1-HSP90 complex is crucial for the assembly of mammalian kinetochores. Therefore, the kinetochore function of Sgt1 is evolutionally conserved between humans and yeast. We initially detected the human SGT1-SGT1 interaction in vitro by immunoprecipitation, although it was weak (data not shown). However, Nyarko et al. (44Nyarko A. Mosbahi K. Rowe A.J. Leech A. Boter M. Shirasu K. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry.. 2007; 46: 11331-11341Google Scholar) recently showed that human SGT1 does not form dimers efficiently by gel-filtration chromatography. Therefore, we further performed analytical ultracentrifuge experiments to determine the strength of dimerization. A monomer-dimer self-association model predicted dissociation equilibrium constants of 173 μm for human SGT1A (data not shown) and 20 nm for yeast Sgt1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, we conclude that human SGT1A exists mainly as a monomer and that yeast Sgt1 exists mainly as a dimer in solution. These results are consistent with the results of Nyarko et al. We thank V.

https://openalex.org/W1993062891,"Background Behavioral studies have shown that infants can form associations between environmental events and produce anticipatory actions for the predictable event, but the neural mechanisms for the learning and anticipation of events in infants are not known. Recent neuroimaging studies revealed that the association cortices of infants show activation related to auditory-stimulus discrimination and novelty detection during sleep. In the present study, we expected that when an auditory cue (beeps) predicted an auditory event (a female voice), specific regions of the infant cortex would show anticipatory activation before the event onset even while sleeping. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the cortical activation of 3-month-old infants during delays between the cue and the event by using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. To investigate spatiotemporal changes in cortical activation over the experimental session, we divided the session into two phases (early and late phase) and analyzed each phase separately. In the early phase, the frontal regions showed activation in response to the cue that was followed by the event compared with another cue that was not followed by any event. In the late phase, the temporoparietal region, in addition to the frontal region, showed prominent activation in response to the cue followed by the event. In contrast, when the cue was followed by an event and no-event in equal proportions, cortical activation in response to the cue was not observed in any phase. Conclusions Sleeping 3-month-old infants showed anticipatory cortical activation in the temporoparietal and frontal regions only in response to the cue predicting the event, suggesting that infants can implicitly form associations between temporally separated events and generate the anticipatory activation before the predictable event. Furthermore, the different time evolution of activation in the temporoparietal and frontal regions suggests that these regions may be involved in different aspects of learning and predicting future events."
https://openalex.org/W2093412381,"Cardiomyocyte (CM) cell cycle analysis has been impeded because of a reliance on primary neonatal cultures of poorly proliferating cells or chronic transgenic animal models with innate compensatory mechanisms.We describe an in vitro model consisting of monolayer cultures of highly proliferative embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived CM. Following induction with ascorbate and selection with puromycin, early CM cultures are >98% pure, and at least 85% of the cells actively proliferate. During the proliferative stage, cells express high levels of E2F3a, B-Myb and phosphorylated forms of retinoblastoma (Rb), but with continued cultivation, cells stop dividing and mature functionally. This developmental transition is characterized by a switch from slow skeletal to cardiac TnI, an increase in binucleation, cardiac calsequestrin and hypophosphorylated Rb, a decrease in E2F3, B-Myb and atrial natriuretic factor, and the establishment of a more negative resting membrane potential. Although previous publications suggested that Rb was not necessary for cell cycle control in heart, we find following acute knockdown of Rb that this factor actively regulates progression through the G1 checkpoint and that its loss promotes proliferation at the expense of CM maturation.We have established a unique model system for studying cardiac cell cycle progression, and show in contrast to previous reports that Rb actively regulates both cell cycle progression through the G1 checkpoint and maturation of heart cells. We conclude that this in vitro model will facilitate the analysis of cell cycle control mechanisms of CMs."
https://openalex.org/W1991163191,"Precisely regulated signal transduction pathways are crucial for the regulation of developmental events and prevention of tumorigenesis. Both the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta)/Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt/Wingless (Wg) pathways play essential roles in organismal patterning and growth, and their deregulation can lead to cancers. We describe a mechanism of interaction between Drosophila Wg and BMP signaling in which Wg target gene expression is antagonized by BMP signaling. In vivo, high levels of both an activated BMP receptor and the BMP effector Mad can inhibit the expression of Wg target genes. Conversely, loss of mad can induce Wg target gene expression. In addition, we find that ectopic expression in vivo of the Wg transcription factor dTcf is able to suppress the inhibitory effect caused by ectopic Mad. In vitro binding studies revealed competition for dTcf binding between Mad and the Wnt effector beta-catenin/Armadillo (Arm). Our in vivo genetic analyses and target gene studies support a mechanism consistent with the in vitro binding and competition studies, namely that BMP pathway components can repress Wg target gene expression by influencing the binding of Arm and dTcf."
https://openalex.org/W1988744242,"The ring contraction process that occurs during cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis is mediated via the action of two enzymes, CobG and CobJ. The first of these generates a tertiary alcohol at the C-20 position of precorrin-3A by functioning as a monooxygenase, a reaction that also forms a gamma lactone with the acetic acid side chain on ring A. The product, precorrin-3B, is then acted upon by CobJ, which methylates at the C-17 position and promotes ring contraction of the macrocycle by catalyzing a masked pinacol rearrangement. Here, we report the characterization of CobG enzymes from Pseudomonas denitrificans and Brucella melitensis. We show that both contain a [4Fe-4S] center as well as a mononuclear non-heme iron. Although both enzymes are active in vivo, the P. denitrificans enzyme was found to be inactive in vitro. Further analysis of this enzyme revealed that the mononuclear non-heme iron was not reducible, and it was concluded that it is rapidly inactivated once it is released from the bacterial cell. In contrast, the B. melitensis enzyme was found to be fully active in vitro and the mononuclear non-heme iron was reducible by dithionite. The reduced mononuclear non-heme was able to react with the oxygen analogue NO, but only in the presence of the substrate precorrin-3A.

Vitamin B12 is the antipernicious anemia factor (1Minot G.R. Murphy W.P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1983; 250: 3328-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whose isolation was first described over 60 years ago (2Rickes E.L. Brink N.G. Koniuszy F.R. Wood T.R. Folkers K. Science. 1948; 107: 396-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Smith E.L. Nature. 1948; 161: 638-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and whose subsequent structure determination by x-ray crystallography revealed that it is a cobalt-containing modified tetrapyrrole (4Hodgkin D.C. Pickworth J. Robertson J.H. Trueblood K.N. Prosen R.J. White J. Nature. 1955; 176: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As such it belongs to the same family of compounds as heme, chlorophyll, siroheme, and coenzyme F430 (5Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The major structural differences between vitamin B12 and these other family members include the shrunken macrocyclic ring that represents the corrin ring component of the vitamin and the presence of upper and lower axial ligands for the centrally chelated metal ion. There has been some considerable interest in the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 as there are no chemical or biological parallels for the removal and extrusion of the integral meso carbon atom that is required for the contraction of the macrocycle (6Battersby A.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The coenzyme form of vitamin B12 is adenosylcobalamin (Fig. 1), which is synthesized by one of the most elaborate and complex biosynthetic pathways known in biological systems requiring somewhere around thirty enzymatic steps for its complete de novo synthesis (5Warren M.J. Raux E. Schubert H.L. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cobalamin biosynthesis is further complicated by the presence of two similar though biochemically distinct pathways that are referred to as the aerobic and anaerobic routes (7Blanche F. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Hertle R. Zipfel F. Müller G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1651-1653Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson S.W. Warren M.J. Bioorg.

Heterocycles. 1994; 39: 471-476Crossref Google Scholar). These pathways differ in their requirement for molecular oxygen and the timing of cobalt insertion. The aerobic pathway requires molecular oxygen to facilitate the ring contraction process prior to cobalt insertion, whereas on the anaerobic route there is no requirement for oxygen but early cobalt insertion is an essential prerequisite for ring contraction. Along the aerobic pathway for cobalamin biosynthesis, the ring contraction process is mediated by two enzymes called CobG and CobJ (11Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Initially, CobG hydroxylates the C-20 position of precorrin-3A and generates a gamma lactone structure with the acetate side chain of ring A to give precorrin-3B (13Debussche, L., Thibaut, D., Danzer, M., Debu, F., Frechet, D., Herman, F., Blanche, F., and Vuilhorgne, M. (1993) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1100–1103Google Scholar). CobG utilizes molecular oxygen, which was first shown when it was demonstrated that the enzyme was inactive under anaerobic conditions (12Scott A.I. Roessner C.A. Stolowich N.J. Spencer J.B. Min C. Ozaki S.I. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was only when the enzyme was incubated with precorrin-3A in the presence of air that any activity was observed. Subsequently, elegant labeling experiments with 18O2 revealed that one atom of oxygen was incorporated into the C-20 position (14Spencer J.B. Stolowich N.J. Roessner C.A. Min C.H. Scott A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11610-11611Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Spencer J.B. Stolowich N.J. Santander P.J. Pichon C. Kajiwara M. Tokiwa S. Takatori K. Scott A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4991-4992Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absolute stereochemistry of precorrin-3B was determined, revealing that the C-20 hydroxyl is cis to the oxygen terminus of the gamma-lactone at C-1 (16Stolowich N.J. Wang J.J. Spencer J.B. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1657-1662Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This reaction prepares the macrocycle for contraction by CobJ via a pinacol-type rearrangement. The extruded carbon fragment is eventually lost as acetic acid. These steps are outlined in Fig. 1. Despite the characterization of the reaction catalyzed by CobG, comparatively little is known about the enzyme itself. CobG is a 459-amino acid protein, with a molecular mass of 46 kDa, and displays similarity to nitrite and sulfite reductases (11Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfite reductase, which catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide, requires both a [4Fe-4S] cluster and siroheme for activity. In this unusual enzyme, the two cofactors are covalently linked through a shared cysteine residue (17Christner J.A. Munck E. Janick P.A. Siegel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2098-2101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Janick P.A. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3538-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the basis that purified CobG was found to have a slight coloration and that atomic absorption analysis of the purified protein indicated that it contained 4.6 mol of Fe and 4 mol of S per mol of protein, it was suggested that the protein is likely to contain a [4Fe-4S] center (11Debussche L. Thibaut D. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a monooxygenase, it has been proposed that the reaction may proceed via an enzyme-bound Fe(III)-O+ species (9Roessner C.A. Santander P.J. Scott A.I. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 267-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we provide the first biophysical evidence that CobG does indeed contain both a mononuclear non-heme iron as well as a [Fe-S] cluster. We also show that the substrate must bind in close proximity to these metalloprosthetic groups. Moreover, the cysteine residues required for Fe-S formation are confirmed and the presence of the Fe-S center is shown to be essential for catalytic activity of the enzyme.

The resulting strain was grown at 37 °C in LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and chloramphenicol (34 mg/liter). Once the cell density reached A600 ≈ 0.6, protein overproduction was induced with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were left to grow overnight at 16 °C before harvesting by centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter, JI30). The pellet was gently resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), and the cells were broken either by one passage through a cell disrupter (Stansted Fluid) operating at 12,000 psi or by sonication (Sonics Vibracell Ultrasonic processor). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was transferred to an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology), maintained at less than 2 ppm oxygen, and applied to a metal affinity chromatography column charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with buffer containing 20 mm imidazole before elution with 400 mm imidazole. In Vivo Assays—The in vivo activity of CobG was determined through complementation using a strain containing all the necessary genes for the production of cobyric acid in E. coli with the exception of cobG. The wild type and mutant cobG genes were excised from the vector pET14b using the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites and ligated into the SpeI and HindIII sites of pLysS. An E. coli strain containing the plasmid pETcoco2[AIΔGJFMKLEHBNSTRWQ] was transformed with the resulting plasmids and restoration of cobyric acid production was monitored using a quantitative bioassay as described previously (20Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In Vitro Assays—CobG activity was measured in vitro using a coupled multi-enzyme system where the production of hydrogenobyrinic acid (HBA) 3The abbreviations used are: HBA, hydrogenobyrinic acid; ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid; NO, nitric oxide; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance. could be easily monitored. To achieve this, a plasmid (pSS200) was constructed that harbored all the genes necessary for the production of HBA except cobG. This plasmid, pSS200, was derived from pED420 and pRS005 by cloning a MfeI/SpeI fragment of pRS005 into pED420, which had been cut with the same enzymes. Cleared lysates of an E. coli strain harboring the plasmid pSS200 were incubated with crude extract of strains overproducing CobG in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, 720 μg/ml S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), 120 μg/ml 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and 100 μg/ml NADPH for 18–20 h under aerobic conditions in the dark at 4 °C. Preparation of Precorrin-3A—Precorrin-3A was synthesized in a multi-enzyme reaction containing HemB, HemC, HemD, CobA, and CobI. The proteins were purified from two E. coli strains harboring the plasmids pRS004 and pED408 by metal affinity chromatography and transferred to an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology). Oxygen and salts were removed by buffer exchange into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.1 m NaCl (PD-10). The protein mixture was incubated with 360 μg/ml SAM and 120 μg/ml ALA under anaerobic conditions in the dark at room temperature for 18–20 h. Isolation of HBA—HBA was purified in its free acid form by initially heating either incubations or extracts containing the compound to 80 °C for 15 min. The extracts were then applied to a small DEAE-Sephadex column and the HBA eluted in 1 m NaCl. The HBA was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography on a BDS Hypersil C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Thermo Electron Corporation) run on a Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD Trap equipped with a diode array detector and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1 with a gradient of acetonitrile in 1 m ammonium acetate. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer operating at X-band. Temperature control was maintained using an Oxford Instruments ESR900 cryostat linked to an ITC503 controller. Experimental conditions were as given in the figure captions. Nitric oxide gas was formed by the reaction of sodium nitrite with FeSO4 (1.2 m) in H2SO4 (1.8 m) under anaerobic conditions and collected in a syringe. Nitric oxide gas was injected into a sealed vial (2-ml HPLC vial) containing 300 μl of sample. Samples were incubated for 5 min before being transferred into EPR tubes and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed in a Belle Technology glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere as described previously (21Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 22Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the purpose of this research the CobG proteins from B. melitensis and P. denitrificans were studied. Details of the cloning of the respective cobG genes into suitable expression vectors are given in the experimental section. The cloning allowed the two proteins to be produced recombinantly in E. coli as His-tagged fusions. Purification of Recombinant CobG—Purifications of the P. denitrificans and B. melitensis CobG proteins were achieved by metal affinity chromatography under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The purified proteins migrated as a single band with a molecular mass of around 50 kDa when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). Purified fractions containing either CobG protein were dark green-brown in color and exhibited a UV-visible spectrum indicative of an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein with a broad absorbance around 415 nm (Fig. 2a). Preparations typically exhibited an A400/A280 ratio between 0.28 and 0.36. When the CobG proteins were purified aerobically, the intensity of the absorbance around 415 nm decreased with time, over a period of a few hours, suggesting that the iron-sulfur center was sensitive to oxygen. His-tagged CobG Is Active in E. coli—There are no cobG mutants available that can be used in complementation studies. We therefore made a recombinant E. coli strain with all the genetic material to allow the biosynthesis of HBA except for cobG. HBA is the first stable ring-contracted molecule that is easily isolated from the aerobic pathway. This strain accumulates precorrin-3A as it does not have the capacity to make the C-20 hydroxylated and gamma lactone-containing intermediate, precorrin-3B. However, transformation of this E. coli strain with a plasmid containing either the B. melitensis or P. denitrificans cobG resulted in it being able to make HBA (Fig. 2c). This demonstrates that both enzymes are active as recombinant His-tagged proteins within E. coli. The activity of the CobG proteins was also investigated in vitro. Here, cell lysates enriched with the enzymes required for uroporphyrinogen III synthesis (HemB, -C, and -D) and all the enzymes for HBA synthesis (CobA, -I, -H, -J, -M, -F, -K, -L) except CobG, were incubated with ALA, SAM, NADPH, and either the P. denitrificans or B. melitensis CobG. In the presence of the B. melitensis CobG, the assay yielded HBA, which was identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. In contrast, however, the P. denitrificans CobG was found to be inactive. Thus, it would appear that P. denitrificans CobG is very unstable once it is released from the intact bacterial cells. Characterization of P. denitrifcans CobG—The UV-visible absorption spectrum of the purified P. denitrificans CobG is characteristic of a Fe-S protein, and the broad absorption in the region of 415 nm is indicative of a [4Fe-4S] center (24Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulphur Proteins. II. Academic Press, New York1973: 195-237Google Scholar, 25Bertini I. Ciurli S. Luchinat C. Structure and Bonding. Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg1995: 1-53Google Scholar). However, to confirm the presence of a putative Fe-S center and to determine the type of center present ([2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], or [4Fe-4S]) an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study was conducted. EPR samples were prepared from CobG that had been purified anaerobically in a glove box and to a concentration of >250 μm. The EPR spectrum of the dithionite reduced CobG, recorded at 15 K, shows features at g = 2.048 and g = 1.927 (Fig. 3a). This EPR signal was not observed at 70 K or in oxidized samples, which precludes it being a [2Fe-2S] or [3Fe-4S] center because of the differences in the properties of the delocalized electrons in the two types of cluster. A [3Fe-4S] center is easily discounted as such centers contain an even number of electrons in the reduced state and thus do not give rise to an EPR signal when reduced. Furthermore their EPR spectra are very weakly axial and appear as an almost isotropic line at g ≈ 2.02 in the oxidized state [3Fe-4S]1+ (26Johnson M.K. Duderstadt R.E. Duin E.C. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 1-82Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is more difficult to distinguish signals arising from [2Fe-2S]1+ and [4Fe-4S]1+, the paramagnetic reduced states of the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters. Both give rise to axial, pseudo-axial or rhombic spectra with at least one g value below 2.0 due to g-anisotropy (27Mouesca J.M. Lamotte B. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1998; 180: 1573-1614Crossref Google Scholar). However, due to the nature of the antiferromagnetic coupling (exchange and double exchange coupling) there are several low lying energy levels available in the [4Fe-4S]1+ system that do not exist in the [2Fe-2S]1+ system, see (27Mouesca J.M. Lamotte B. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1998; 180: 1573-1614Crossref Google Scholar) for further discussion of energy levels in Fe-S systems. The availability of these energy levels promotes electronic relaxation, leading to very short electron spin relaxation times (28Bertrand P. Gayda J.-P. Rao K.K. J. Chem. Phys. 1982; 76: 4715-4719Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These relaxation times are so short as to effectively preclude the observation of the [4Fe-4S]1+ signal at temperatures above 40 K. Collectively, the measured g values and the observed temperature dependence of the signal allow the spectrum to be safely assigned to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster (24Lovenberg W. Iron-Sulphur Proteins. II. Academic Press, New York1973: 195-237Google Scholar, 29Sweeney W.V. Rabinowitz J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 139-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). CobG Contains a Mononuclear Non-heme Iron Center—Because CobG does not contain a bound heme or flavin cofactor it has been speculated that the activation of molecular oxygen by CobG may be achieved through a mononuclear non-heme iron center (9Roessner C.A. Santander P.J. Scott A.I. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 267-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using EPR spectroscopy it has been possible to confirm that CobG does indeed contain a bound mononuclear non-heme iron center. The EPR spectrum, which was observed in both the oxidized and dithionite-reduced samples, with g = 4.08 (Fig. 3b) is assigned to a high spin (total spin S = 5/2) monomeric non-heme Fe3+ ion in a rhombic ligand field. The EPR line shapes of high spin mononuclear Fe3+ centers are dominated by zero field splitting (30Solomon E.I. Brunold T.C. Davis M.I. Kemsley J.N. Lee S.K. Lehnert N. Neese F. Skulan A.J. Yang Y.S. Zhou J. Chem. Rev. 2000; 100: 235-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). These arise from the effects of the ligand arrangement around the ion on the energies of the five electronic orbitals populated by the unpaired electrons. Different ligand arrangements lift the degeneracy in the energies of these orbitals in different ways, thus zero field splitting is indicative of the ligand geometry at the ion and is very sensitive to changes in this geometry. The zero field splitting is described by two parameters, the axial, D, and rhombic, E, zero field splitting parameters. When E/D ≈1/3, indicating a rhombic ligand field, the EPR spectrum consists of a single line at g ≈ 4.3. The line width of the EPR spectrum we observed is somewhat larger than might be expected for a typical mononuclear Fe3+ iron center. This may arise from E and D values that give E/D of slightly less than 1/3, deviation from ideal rhombic ligand field, or from heterogeneity in the sample leading to an overlap of many different spectra with slightly different E/D. To be catalytically active the iron center would need to be reduced to Fe2+ prior to the binding and activation of dioxygen. However, reduction of the mononuclear non-heme iron, which would be observable as a loss of the EPR signal since Fe2+ (S = 2) is EPR silent, could not be achieved using either sodium dithionite, sodium borohydride, or ascorbate as the reducing agent. Furthermore, the addition of precorrin-3A or either α-ketoglutarate or pterin, which are known to be cofactors for mononuclear non-heme iron proteins (31Neidig, M. L., and Solomon, E. I. (2005) Chem. Comm. 5843–5863Google Scholar), had no effect on the EPR spectra and/or the reduction of the iron center by dithionite. Conversely, by this method it was not possible to determine if any Fe2+ was already present in the sample. The lack of reducibility of this iron species may explain why the P. denitrificans enzyme was found to be inactive when it was assayed in vitro. Midpoint Redox Potential for the P. denitrificans CobG—The midpoint redox potential for the P. denitrificans CobG was determined by redox potentiometry using anaerobic spectroelectrochemical methods, as described in previous studies (21Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 22Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13421-13429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As we have observed recently in studies of the 4Fe-4S center in the PduT protein from Citrobacter freundii (32Parsons J.B. Dinesh S.D. Deery E. Leech H.K. Brindley A.A. Heldt D. Frank S. S"
https://openalex.org/W2083022553,"Ecto-phosphorylation plays an important role in many cellular functions. The transmembrane glycoprotein CD98 contains potential phosphorylation sites in its extracellular C-terminal tail. We hypothesized that extracellular signaling through ecto-protein kinases (ePKs) might lead to ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 and influence its multiple functions, including its role in cell-cell interactions. Our results show that recombinant CD98 was phosphorylated in vitro by ePKs from Jurkat cells and by the commercial casein kinase 2 (CK2). Alanine substitutions at serines-305/307/309 or serines-426/430 attenuated CK2-mediated CD98 phosphorylation, suggesting that these residues are the dominant phosphorylation sites for CK2. Furthermore, CD98 expressed in the basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells was ecto-phosphorylated by Jurkat cell-derived ePKs and ecto-CK2 was involved in this process. Importantly, cell attachment studies showed that the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 enhanced heterotypic cell-cell interactions and that the extracellular domain of CD98, which possesses the serine phosphorylation sites, was crucial for this effect. In addition, phosphorylation of recombinant CD98 increased its interactions with Jurkat and Caco2-BBE cells, and promoted cell attachment and spreading. In conclusion, here we demonstrated the ecto-phosphorylation of CD98 by ePKs and its functional importance in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism involved in regulating the multiple functions of CD98 and raise CD98 as a promising target for therapeutic modulations of cell-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1987293272,"The initiation of chromosomal DNA replication is tightly regulated to achieve genome replication just once per cell cycle and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) plays an important role in this process. Adenine nucleotides that bind to the origin recognition complex (ORC) are also suggested to be involved in this process. Of the six subunits of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORC (Orc1–6p), both Orc1p and Orc5p have ATP binding activity, and both Orc2p and Orc6p are phosphorylated by CDK in cells. In this study we constructed a series of yeast strains expressing phospho-mimetic mutants of Orc2p or Orc6p and found that expression of a Ser-188 mutant of Orc2p (Orc2-5Dp) delays G1-S transition and S phase progression and causes the accumulation of cells with 2C DNA content. Using antibody that specifically recognizes Ser-188-phosphorylated Orc2p, we showed that Ser-188 is phosphorylated by CDK in a cell cycle-regulated manner. Expression of Orc2-5Dp caused phosphorylation of Rad53p and inefficient loading of the six minichromosome maintenance proteins. These results suggest that the accumulation of cells with 2C DNA content is due to inefficient origin firing and induction of the cell cycle checkpoint response and that dephosphorylation of Ser-188 of Orc2p in late M or G1 phase may be involved in pre-RC formation.

This is the first demonstration of a link between phosphorylation of the ORC and its ability to bind ATP, which may be important for the cell cycle-regulated initiation of DNA replication. The initiation of chromosomal DNA replication is tightly regulated to replicate the genome just once per cell cycle. To achieve this, both induction of initiation at the G1-S boundary and inhibition of initiation in other phases of the cell cycle are required. The mechanisms governing this regulation in eukaryotes have been studied the most extensively in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and we describe mostly events in budding yeast in this paper otherwise noticed. Cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; ORC, origin recognition complex; pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance proteins; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; α-factor, α-mating factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ARS1, autonomously replicating sequence 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; ORC, origin recognition complex; pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; MCM, minichromosome maintenance proteins; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; α-factor, α-mating factor; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ARS1, autonomously replicating sequence 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. play essential roles in both the induction and inhibition of initiation; low CDK activity in late M and G1 phases is required to prepare for initiation of DNA replication, and high CDK activity in S, G2, and early M phases is required for suppression of re-initiation of DNA replication before cell division. This high CDK activity is also involved in initiation of DNA replication at the G1-S boundary (1Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2000; 69: 829-880Google Scholar, 2Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem.. 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar, 3Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 1997; 13: 293-332Google Scholar, 4Diffley J.F. Curr. Biol.. 2004; 14: 778-786Google Scholar). Cell cycle-regulated formation of protein complexes on origins of chromosomal DNA replication is a key step in regulation of the initiation of DNA replication. In G1 phase (under low CDK activity), a protein complex called the “pre-replication complex (pre-RC)” is formed on each origin. The pre-RC contains several proteins including the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6p, Cdt1p, and the six minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM), Mcm2–7p. The ORC was originally identified as a six-protein complex that specifically bound to S. cerevisiae origins of DNA replication (5Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature.. 1992; 357: 128-134Google Scholar), and its homologues have been found in various eukaryotic species, including human (3Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.. 1997; 13: 293-332Google Scholar). In this manuscript, “ORC” refers to S. cerevisiae ORC. The ORC is bound to chromatin at the origins of chromosomal DNA replication throughout the cell cycle and is thought to function as a “landing pad” for the assembly of pre-RC. At the G1-S boundary, CDK and another kinase (Cdc7p-Dbf4p) activate the pre-RC to initiate chromosomal DNA replication. After initiation, re-formation of the pre-RC is strictly prohibited to suppress re-initiation of DNA replication, and high CDK activity is essential for this process; artificial inhibition of CDK activity in G2 phase resulted in re-formation of pre-RC and re-initiation of DNA replication (6Dahmann C. Diffley J.F. Nasmyth K.A. Curr. Biol.. 1995; 5: 1257-1269Google Scholar, 7Noton E. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell.. 2000; 5: 85-95Google Scholar, 8Weinreich M. Liang C. Chen H.H. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 11211-11217Google Scholar). The B type cyclin-CDK complex affects initiation of DNA replication through two distinct mechanisms, phosphorylation of, or direct binding to replication-related proteins (9Mimura S. Seki T. Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nature.. 2004; 431: 1118-1123Google Scholar, 10Wilmes G.M. Archambault V. Austin R.J. Jacobson M.D. Bell S.P. Cross F.R. Genes Dev.. 2004; 18: 981-991Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of the components of the protein complex present on origin DNA that are phosphorylated by CDK and an understanding of the role of this phosphorylation are important for understanding the mechanisms which ensure that replication occurs just once per cell cycle. It has been suggested that Orc2p, Orc6p, Cdc6p, and MCM are phosphorylated by CDK in a cell cycle-regulated manner. Phosphorylation of Cdc6p or MCM seems to cause its degradation or nuclear exclusion, respectively (11Elsasser S. Chi Y. Yang P. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 1999; 10: 3263-3277Google Scholar, 12Sanchez M. Calzada A. Bueno A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 9092-9097Google Scholar, 13Drury L.S. Perkins G. Diffley J.F.

Cell Biol.. 1999; 1: 415-422Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of degradation-resistant Cdc6p and Mcm7p with an exogenous nuclear localization signal with the expression of mutant forms of Orc2p and Orc6p in which possible CDK-phosphorylated sites are mutated to be inert, induced reformation of the pre-RC and re-initiation of DNA replication without inhibition of CDK (18Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature.. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Google Scholar, 19Archambault V. Ikui A.E. Drapkin B.J. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 6707-6721Google Scholar). These results suggest that CDK-dependent phosphorylation of ORC, Cdc6p, and MCM play an important role in suppression of re-formation of pre-RC and re-initiation of DNA replication. However, at present it is unclear which subunit (Orc2p or Orc6p) or which possible CDK-phosphorylated site is responsible for this regulation and how the phosphorylation of ORC suppresses the re-initiation of DNA replication. Furthermore, the role of dephosphorylation of ORC in late M or G1 phase cannot be ruled out by use of mutants that are inert for phosphorylation. To address these issues, characterization of phospho-mimetic mutants (in which particular CDK target amino acid residues are substituted with Asp or Glu) is useful. For example, analysis of a phospho-mimetic mutant of Sld2p suggested that phosphorylation of Sld2p is responsible for CDK-dependent initiation of DNA replication (20Tanaka S. Umemori T. Hirai K. Muramatsu S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Nature.. 2007; 445: 328-332Google Scholar, 21Tak Y.S. Tanaka Y. Endo S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 1987-1996Google Scholar, 22Masumoto H. Muramatsu S.

EMBO J.. 1997; 16: 3724-3730Google Scholar), adenine nucleotides bound to the ORC seem to regulate the initiation of DNA replication. The ORC has two subunits (Orc1p and Orc5p), which bind ATP (28Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell.. 1997; 88: 493-502Google Scholar, 29Makise M. Takenaka H. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 46440-46445Google Scholar). Orc1p, but not Orc5p, has ATPase activity, which stimulates the loading of MCM onto origins (30Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell.. 2004; 16: 967-978Google Scholar, 31Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell.. 2006; 21: 29-39Google Scholar). Orc5p, but not Orc1p, can bind ADP (32Takenaka H. Makise M. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 340: 29-37Google Scholar). The binding of ATP to Orc1p, but not to Orc5p, is essential for the specific binding of ORC to origin DNA (28Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell.. 1997; 88: 493-502Google Scholar, 29Makise M. Takenaka H. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 46440-46445Google Scholar). ATP binding to Orc5p increases the affinity of Orc1p for ATP in vitro (29Makise M. Takenaka H. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 46440-46445Google Scholar) and is important for maintaining the stability of ORC in vivo (33Takahashi N. Yamaguchi Y. Yamairi F. Makise M. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 8469-8477Google Scholar, 34Makise M. Takahashi N. Matsuda K. Yamairi F. Suzuki K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J.. 2007; 402: 397-403Google Scholar). However, a link between phosphorylation of ORC and its ATP binding activity has not been previously established. In this study we constructed a series of yeast strains expressing phospho-mimetic mutant Orc2p or Orc6p for each possible CDK-phosphorylated site. We found that expression of a Ser-188 mutant of Orc2p, but not of other CDK-phosphorylated site mutants, delays cell growth, G1-S transition, S phase progression, and pre-RC formation. This suggests that Ser-188 is the key amino acid residue in CDK-dependent regulation of ORC. Thus, dephosphorylation of Ser-188 of Orc2p in late M or G1 phase may be involved in the formation of pre-RC. In vitro, the purified phospho-mimetic mutant ORC containing the Ser-188 Orc2p mutant retained the ATP binding activity of Orc1p and origin DNA binding activity but lost the ATP binding activity of Orc5p. We consider that phosphorylation of Ser-188 of Orc2p affects pre-RC formation by inhibiting the binding of ATP to Orc5p. Chemicals, Plasmids, and Strains—[α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and poly(dI/dC) were purchased from GE Healthcare, and 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP was from ALT Bioscience.

To express HA-tagged Orc2p in cells, pRS413–3HA and pRS413-GAL1-3HA were first constructed. Plasmid pRS413–3HA has a triple HA epitope gene (3HA) in the XhoI-ApaI site, and pRS413-GAL1-3HA has the GAL1 promoter (from –457 to –1) in the BamHI-EcoRV site. An expression plasmid, pRS413-ORC2-3HA (or pRS413-GAL1-ORC2-3HA), contains ORC2 ligated in-frame with 3HA. A plasmid pRS425-GAL1-ORC2-3HA was constructed by insertion of the BssHII-BssHII DNA fragment of pRS413-GAL1-ORC2-3HA into the same restriction enzyme site on pRS425. Plasmids pRS413-ORC6 and pRS416-ORC6 contain ORC6 (from –600 to +1808) cloned into the XbaI-XhoI site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CDK consensus sites was done as described previously (36Matsuda K. Makise M. Sueyasu Y. Takehara M. Asano T. Mizushima T. FEMS Yeast Res.. 2007; 7: 1263-1269Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing orc2- (or orc6)-All-A were PCR-amplified using chromosomal DNA prepared from pJL1095 and pJL1096 cells (gifts from Dr. Li (University of California, San Francisco)) (18Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature.. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Google Scholar) as templates. A series of expression plasmids for mutant forms of orc were constructed by replacement of the wild-type ORC gene with each mutant orc gene. S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table 1 (37Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell.. 1989; 56: 619-630Google Scholar, 38Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell.. 1995; 81: 667-676Google Scholar). These strains were cultured in YP medium (2% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2 mg/ml adenine hemisulfate) or synthetic complete medium containing glucose or galactose.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeReferencesW303-1AMATa leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1-100 ade2-1 his3-11 trp1-1Ref. 37Thomas B.J.

We confirmed that all tetrads showed only two viable spores. For plasmid shuffling, plasmid pRS413 (a low copy number plasmid containing HIS) (39Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics.. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar) with each mutant orc2 or orc6 gene, was transformed into YMM10 or YMM18 cells by the lithium acetate method. The transformants were cultured on synthetic complete agar plates containing 2% glucose and 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) at 30 °C for 3 days. YMM77 is a derivative of YMM10 in which pRS405-GAL1-orc2-1–3FLAG was integrated into the leu2 locus. YMM84 and YMM76 are derivatives of YMM77 in which pRS403-ORC2-3HA and pRS403-orc2-5d-3HA, respectively, were integrated into the his3 locus. We confirmed these integrations by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Preparation of Antibodies and ORC—Rabbit polyclonal antibody against Ser-188-phosphorylated Orc2p (α-Ser(P)-188) was generated against synthetic peptide with the following sequence: NHDFTS(PO4)PLKQIIC (40Kuniyasu A. Kaneko K. Kawahara K. Nakayama H. FEBS Lett.. 2003; 552: 259-263Google Scholar). The antibody was purified on a protein A-Sepharose column followed by Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) coupled with the synthetic peptide. The specificity of the antibody was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the peptide and the peptide lacking the phosphorus at the serine residue (data not shown). ORCs were co-expressed in Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses and purified as described (29Makise M. Takenaka H. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 46440-46445Google Scholar). Baculovirus containing the phospho-mimetic orc2 gene was constructed using a BD BaculoGold™ transfection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphorylation of ORC—Purification of yeast recombinant CDK (rGST-Cdc28-Clb5) was performed as described (21Tak Y.S. Tanaka Y. Endo S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 1987-1996Google Scholar). The plasmid, pGEX6P-1/CDC28-CAK1-CKS1-CLB5 was gift from Dr. Araki (National Institute of Genetics). To obtain an active recombinant GST-Cdc28/Clb5 complex (rGST-Cdc28-Clb5), the cell extracts prepared from Escherichia coli Rosseta 2(DE)pLysS cells (Novagen) harboring the plasmid was applied to the glutathione-Sepharose column, and rGST-Cdc28-Clb5 was eluted with the buffer containing reduced glutathione. For phosphorylation of ORC, ORC (30 pmol) and recombinant CDK (13.5 pmol) were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h in the buffer (600 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP. To remove ATP from ORC samples, ORC was precipitated with SP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and eluted with the buffer containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 10% v/v glycerol. UV-cross-linking Assay—UV-cross-linking experiments were done as described previously (28Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell.. 1997; 88: 493-502Google Scholar, 29Makise M. Takenaka H. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 46440-46445Google Scholar). ORC (3 pmol) was incubated with 4 μm 8-N3-[γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of ARS1 DNA fragments at 4 °C for 5 min. Samples were placed on Parafilm and subjected to UV irradiation at 4 °C for 2 min. The photolabeling reaction was terminated by the addition of stop solution (70 μl) containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and 20 mm EDTA. Samples were precipitated by 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (10%) containing SDS. Gels were stained with silver to identify each ORC subunit, and radiolabeled subunits were detected by autoradiography. Filter Binding Assay—ORC was incubated with [α-32P]ATP or radiolabeled DNA fragments (200 fmol) at 30 °C for 5 min in 40 μl of buffer T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). In some of the ATP binding experiments, ORC was further incubated with DNA fragments at 30 °C for 5 min in the same buffer. Samples were passed through nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore HA, 0.45 μm) and washed with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer T twice. The radioactivity remaining on the filter was monitored with a liquid scintillation counter. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activity of ORC was measured as described previously (28Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell.. 1997; 88: 493-502Google Scholar) with some modifications. ORC (0.3 pmol) was incubated with DNA fragments (6 pmol) in 10 μl of ATPase buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH pH7.6, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 10 μm radiolabeled ATP) for 60 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2% w/v SDS (5 μl), and adenine nucleotides were separated on polyethyleneimine cellulose F TLC plates (Merck). Chromatin Binding Assay—Yeast spheroplasts were lysed with Triton X-100, and the samples were processed into soluble (supernatant) and chromatin (insoluble precipitate) fractions by centrifugation as previously described (41Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev.. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Google Scholar, 42Takahashi N. Tsutsumi S. Tsuchiya T. Stillman B. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 16033-16040Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts (total protein) of chromatin fractions were subjected to electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (10%) containing SDS, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies. FACS Analysis—The samples were prepared as previously described (33Takahashi N. Yamaguchi Y. Yamairi F. Makise M. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 8469-8477Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 50 mm sodium citrate once, pelleted again by centrifugation, incubated with 50 mm sodium citrate containing 0.25 mg/ml RNase A for 1 h at 50 °C, and then treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide at 4 °C for 1 h, and 20,000 cells from each sample were scanned with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—A gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described (32Takenaka H. Makise M. Kuwae W. Takahashi N. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Mol. Biol.. 2004; 340: 29-37Google Scholar, 43Lee J.R. Makise M. Takenaka H. Takahashi N. Yamaguchi Y. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. J.. 2002; 362: 395-399Google Scholar) with some modifications. ORCs were incubated with adenine nucleotides for 5 min at 30 °C and with radiolabeled wild-type ARS1 or mutant ars1/A–B1– DNA fragments (100 fmol) for 5 min at 30 °C in 10 μl of buffer T containing 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 10 μg/ml poly(dI/dC) (nonspecific competitors). The reaction sample was loaded onto a 3.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE (0.045 m Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA). The gel was electrophoresed for 1.5 h at a constant 200 V, dried, and autoradiographed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—A ChIP assay was done as described previously (44Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell.. 1997; 91: 59-69Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C. After the addition of 125 mm (final concentration) glycine, cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads in the buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Samples were sonicated 30 times for 10 s (to achieve an average fragment size of 0.5–1 kilobases). Immunoprecipitation was performed with magnetic beads which were coated with protein G (Dynal) and antibody against HA or Mcm2p. Precipitates were washed, processed for DNA purification, and subjected to PCR. The PCR cycles included an initial denaturation step of 0.5 min at 95 °C, which was followed by 35 cycles of a denaturation step for 0.5 min at 95 °C, an annealing step for 0.5 min at 50 °C, a polymerization step for 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 4 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 3% agarose gel and visualized under UV after ethidium bromide staining. Site-directed Mutational Analysis of Orc2p and Orc6p Phosphorylation—It was reported that Orc2p and Orc6p have six (Ser-16, Ser-24, Thr-70, Thr-174, Ser-188, and Ser-206) and four (Ser-106, Ser-116, Ser-123, and Thr-146) consensus CDK phosphorylation sites ((S/T)PX(K/R)), respectively (Fig. 1A). Expression of mutant forms of Orc2p and Orc6p in which these amino acid residues were substituted with Ala caused re-initiation of DNA replication in G2 phase when a degradation-resistant mutant of Cdc6p and a Mcm7p with an exogenous nuclear localization signal were expressed simultaneously (18Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature.. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Google Scholar, 19Archambault V. Ikui A.E. Drapkin B.J. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2005; 25: 6707-6721Google Scholar). We constructed a phospho-mimetic mutant of Orc2p, Orc2-All-Dp, in which all of the consensus CDK phosphorylation sites were mutated to Asp. Orc6-All-Dp was constructed in a similar way. We also constructed Orc2-All-Ap and Orc6-All-Ap in which the consensus CDK phosphorylation sites were mutated to Ala. Each mutant gene was inserted into a plasmid, and the plasmid was transformed into strain YMM10 (or YMM18) which contains a chromosomal ORC2 or ORC6 deletion and an alternative wild-type gene on a plasmid with the URA3 selectable maker. When the transformants were grown on agar plates containing 5-FOA, the URA3 plasmid was selected against and lost, causing cells to rely solely on the mutant orc2 or orc6 gene (plasmid-shuffling analysis). YMM10 (or YMM18) cells containing plasmid carrying the wild-type genes could grow, and those containing vector only could not grow on the 5-FOA-containing plates (Fig. 1B), showing that the plasmid-shuffling system works well. As shown in Fig. 1B, YMM10 cells expressing Orc2-All-Dp could grow on agar plates without 5-FOA but not on those with 5-FOA. On the other hand, YMM18 expressing Orc6-All-Dp could grow even on agar plates containing 5-FOA (Fig. 1B). Plasmid shuffling analysis also showed that both of the Ala substitution mutants can support cell growth (Fig. 1B), as described previously (18Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature.. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Google Scholar). Based on results in Fig. 1, we consider that dephosphorylation of Orc2p but not of Orc6p is required for cell growth and cell cycle progression. To identify the amino acid residue responsible for the phenotype exhibited by cells expressing Orc2-All-Dp, we constructed a series of mutant Orc2p, as shown in Fig. 1C, and analyzed the function of each mutant protein by plasmid shuffling analysis. Results show that the S188D Orc2p mutant (Orc2-5Dp) but not the variants of Orc2p with mutations in the other consensus CDK phosphorylation sites is unable to support cell growth (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, a mutant Orc2p in which all of the consensus CDK phosphorylation sites except the Ser-188 are replaced with Asp (Orc2-12346Dp) could support cell growth (Fig. 1C). Thus, we concluded that Ser-188 is an important target of CDK for controlling cell cycle progression, and phosphorylation of this amino acid residue may block cell cycle progression. To detect phosphorylation of Ser-188 of Orc2p in vivo, we prepared polyclonal antibody that recognizes Ser-188-phosphorylated Orc2p (α-Ser(P)-188). As shown in Fig. 2A, α-Ser(P)-188 detected a band with the same migration as that detected by antibody against HA in cells expressing wild-type HA-tagged Orc2p but not in cells expressing HA-tagged Ser-188 Orc2p mutant (Orc2-5Dp or Orc2-5Ap). The band was not detected in the wild-type Orc2p-containing sample that had been treated with λ-protein phosphatase (Fig. 2B). Based on these results, we conclude that α-Ser(P)-188 can specifically recognize Ser-188-phosphorylated Orc2p. As sho"

https://openalex.org/W2029922368,"An unintended consequence of global industrialization and associated societal rearrangements is new interactions of microbes and potential hosts (especially mammals and plants), providing an opportunity for the rapid emergence of host-microbe adaptation and eventual establishment of new microbe-related diseases. We describe a new model system comprising the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and several microbes, each representing different modes of interaction, to study such “maladaptations”. The model microbes include human and agricultural pathogens and microbes that are commonly considered innocuous. The system has a large knowledge base corresponding to each component organism and is amenable to high-throughput automation assisted perturbation screens for identifying components that modulate host-pathogen interactions. This would aid in the study of emergence and progression of host-microbe maladaptations in a controlled environment."
https://openalex.org/W2118472001,"In all dividing eukaryotic cells, the mitotic spindle (composed primarily of microtubules) must interact with chromosomes through a complex protein assembly called the kinetochore. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Dam1-DASH complex plays an important role in promoting attachment between the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle. It also actively participates in the physical separation of sister chromatids in anaphase. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms used by Dam1-DASH has been facilitated by bacterial co-expression of the ten Dam1-DASH genes, which results in the production of a heterodecameric protein complex that can be studied in vitro. However, individual protein subunits are not soluble when expressed in E. coli, thus precluding analysis of the nature of the interaction between subunits and an examination of the assembly of the functional complex. In this paper, we describe the expression, solubilization, purification and refolding of Dad1p, one of the Dam1-DASH complex subunits. In addition, we show that Dad1p, when isolated in this manner forms dimers and/or tetramers, dependent upon protein concentration. This work provides an important tool for studying the Dam1-DASH complex that was previously unavailable, and provides an avenue of investigation for understanding how the individual heterodecamers associate with each other to facilitate chromosome segregation."
