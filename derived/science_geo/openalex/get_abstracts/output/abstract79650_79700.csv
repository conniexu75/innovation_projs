https://openalex.org/W1998556703,"We have produced a monoclonal antibody that reacts with all classes of intermediate filaments in immunofluorescence assays, including glial filaments in astrocytes, neurofilaments in axons, tonofilaments in epithelial PtK2 cells and intermediate filaments in fibroblasts. It also binds to Z lines in skeletal muscle. In SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the antibody binds to most and perhaps all of the major intermediate filament proteins that have been previously defined, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, the three vertebrate neurofilament proteins (the ""neurofilament triplet""), vimentin, desmin, several cytokeratins and the neurofilament proteins of squid and the marine worm Myxicola. In addition, the antibody binds to a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 66,000 that may be a component of all intermediate filaments. These findings suggest that all vertebrate and invertebrate intermediate filament proteins share a common antigenic determinant and raise the possibility that all intermediate filaments contain a 66,000 molecular weight protein."

https://openalex.org/W2133531135,"An SV40-adenovirus 7 hybrid virus, PARA(cT), has been described that is defective for the nuclear transport of SV40 large tumor antigen. An SV40(cT) mutant was constructed using SV40 early and late region DNA fragments derived from PARA(cT) and wild-type SV40 respectively. The SV40(cT)-3 construct is defective for viral replication, but can be propagated in COS-1 cells. T antigen induced by SV40(cT)-3 is localized in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The cT mutation also inhibits the transport of wild-type T antigen; COS-1 cells lose their constitutive expression of nuclear T antigen after infection with SV40(cT)-3. Sequence analysis revealed that the cT mutation results in the replacement of a positively charged lysine in wild-type T antigen with a neutral asparagine at amino acid number 128, demonstrating that the alteration of a single amino acid is sufficient to abolish nuclear transport. Implications of the cT mutation on possible mechanisms for the transport of proteins to the nucleus are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2087530891,"The Escherichia coli K12 lambda receptor is a multifunctional outer membrane protein whose precursor, encoded in gene lamB, is cleaved during export. We present the DNA sequence of lamB and of the distal region that contains repetitive and palindromic sequences and could give rise to highly stable mRNA structures. The calculated molecular weight of the lambda receptor is 47,400. Of the 421 amino acids, 89 are charged, mostly negatively. No region devoid of charged amino acids and long enough to serve as a transmembrane portion is detected. The distribution of charges presents special features that we comment upon in relation to the structure, functions and localization of the lambda receptor. Gene lamB is followed by molA, an unidentified reading frame corresponding to a 131-amino-acid peptide with the characteristics of an exported protein."

https://openalex.org/W2027730367,"We have determined the effects of the nusA gene protein and the regulatory nucleotide guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) on pausing and termination of transcription in the leader region of the rrnB operon in vitro. The leader region of rrnB contains several types of potential regulatory sequences that act at the level of RNA chain elongation and may be involved in control of bacterial growth. We have mapped a termination site, tL, located 260 bases from rrnB promoter P1. Termination at tL is dependent on the nusA protein and is enhanced by ppGpp. The DNA sequence at tL shows striking homologies with trp t', a terminator also strongly affected in vitro by the nusA protein. These in vitro results suggest that rRNA transcription in vivo may be regulated in part through an attenuation mechanism that leads to termination of rrnB chains in the leader region. In addition to tL, elongation of transcription in the leader region is affected by several pause sites that are sensitive to the concentration of ppGpp and the presence of the nusA gene protein. The location and properties of these pause sites suggest that they may also play a role in regulation of rrnB transcription through a mechanism we have termed ""turnstile"" attenuation. One pause site, located 90 and 91 bases from P1, is unique in that it is not normally a site for transcriptional pausing, but is dependent on simultaneous binding of polymerase at rrnB promoter P2. This leads to blockage of P1 transcripts at high RNA polymerase densities and may provide an additional locus for regulation of rrn transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2138101372,"Transposon mutagenesis and complementation analysis of the photosynthesis genes in Rhodopseudomonas capsulata is presented utilizing Tn5.7 mutagenized R-primes. The R-prime pRPS404 contains many of the genes necessary for the differentiation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Utilizing homologous recombination, 30 independent copies of Tn5.7 were inserted into the R. capsulata chromosome with subsequent deletion of wild-type alleles. Mutants were characterized by absorption spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, and determination of capability for photosynthetic growth. Many mutations in the bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthetic pathways were isolated. A regulatory mutation was isolated affecting reaction-center synthesis as well as a 44 kd heme-containing polypeptide. Complementation analysis using various pRPR404::Tn5.7 plasmids has led to the postulation of transcriptional units."

https://openalex.org/W2067564842,"Variegating position effects in Drosophila result from chromosome rearrangements where normal genes, having been placed next to heterochromatin, are inactivated in some cells but not in others, thereby producing a variegated tissue. We have determined that the euchromatic breakpoints for three variegating white mutants are clustered and lie approximately 25 kb downstream of the white structural gene. In each case the white locus is adjoined in the heterochromatin to a mobile genetic element. Satellite sequences are not involved. We also demonstrate that revertants of the variegating mutant, wm4, are reinversions that leave the initial wm4-heterochromatic junction intact so that some heterochromatin-derived sequences remain joined to white at its new location. These results suggest a simple model for understanding the structure of heterochromatic domains and how variegating position effects may arise."

https://openalex.org/W1977542860,"To examine the role of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in mRNA splicing, we have injected SV40 DNA, in the presence or absence of anti-Sm or anti-(U1)RNP antibodies, into the nucleus of X. laevis oocytes, and analyzed the viral specific RNAs and proteins that were synthesized. In the absence of antibodies, the majority of the viral mRNAs were spliced, giving rise to transcripts and proteins analogous to those found in infected monkey cells. However, the relative efficiencies with which the various splice sites were utilized were different in the two cell types. When sera from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients containing anti-Sm or anti-(U1)RNP antibodies were coinjected with the viral DNA, splicing of L-strand-specific (late) mRNA was dramatically inhibited. Cleavage at both 5' and 3' splice sites was blocked, leading to an accumulation of unspliced primary transcripts. Neither the total amount of late RNA synthesized nor the formation of mature polyadenylated late mRNA 3' ends was affected. These results indicate that U1 snRNPs play a crucial role in mRNA splicing in vivo. Unexpectedly, the effects of the sera on E-strand-specific (early) viral mRNA splicing were different. All anti-Sm or -(U1)RNP sera tested had no detectable effect on the splicing of the mRNA coding for the small tumor antigen. A subset of these sera, however, inhibited large tumor antigen mRNA splicing. On the basis of these data it is suggested that different pre-mRNAs, or even different splice sites within the same pre-mRNA, have dissimilar interactions with snRNP particles in the splicing reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2110559140,"To study the poliovirus-induced inhibition of host-cell RNA synthesis, we prepared transcription extracts from mock-infected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. In contrast with the control extracts, poliovirus-infected cell extracts prepared 3 hr after infection were unable to transcribe specifically DNA templates recognized by RNA polymerase II. Accurate transcription by RNA polymerase III, however, was only slightly reduced. Supplementation of the infected cell extract with a crude preparation of transcription factors (S100) restored its ability to transcribe a polymerase II template specifically; supplementation with purified polymerase II had no effect. When the S100 was fractionated on a phosphocellulose column, the restoration activity eluted between 0.35 M and 1 M KCl. When we tested infected extracts for inhibitory activity by mixing uninfected and infected cell extracts, no in vitro inhibition of polymerase II transcription by the uninfected extract was evident. These results indicate that at least one factor required for specific transcription by polymerase II is deficient in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells."

https://openalex.org/W1977922154,"ACCORDING to Fisher's “Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection1”, the rate of change of the mean fitness of a population equals the genetic variance in fitness. If w is the fitness and VGw the genetic variance in fitness, then by Fisher's theorem Falconer2 showed that if fitness varies in a way that is partially determined by variations in a character, x, then where covG(x,w) is the genetic covariance of x and w. This equation Falconer calls the “Extension to Fisher's Fundamental Theorem”. It will be true only if the regression of fitness and the character is linear. That is, we must have a relationship where It then follows that the genetic load of any change Δx in the mean of the character can be calculated. We have by definition of the genetic load3 where wmax is the fitness of the most fit genotype. Now we have and It then follows directly that If the change per generation in the mean of the character is known, then The genetic load is an important quantity to know because it measures the intensity of natural selection. If fitness is the probability of survival, then the genetic load is the proportion of the deaths which arise from variations in fitness. Thus it L is large, a population may be in dangerof extinction. For example, suppose a continuous series of fossils shows a change to a new form. During a period of change, we can find Δx if we know the number of generations that has passed. xmax will be the value of the character when the new form has finally become stable. x will be the moan at some point in time in the evolutionary process. Thus we can find L at that time. Usually, evolutionary changes occur as populations adapt to new environments. In a new environment xmax will have a new value. The shift of x away from xmax produces the genetic load which may be high if VGx is small. The formula for L shows why a large genetic variance helps a population to adapt to an environmental change: if VGx is low the genetic load may be high and the population may become extinct before it can adapt itself. It would therefore be interesting to compare the genetic loads in fossil populations which died out and in those that increased in numbers."
