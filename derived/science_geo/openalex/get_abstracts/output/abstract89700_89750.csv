https://openalex.org/W1560801910,"We have tested the ability of various glycosaminoglycans to increase the rate of inhibition of thrombin by heparin cofactor II (HCII) and by antithrombin III (ATIII) isolated from human plasma. Heparin, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate from bovine liver (in order of decreasing activity) activated HCII. In contrast, only heparin and bovine liver heparan sulfate activated ATIII, whereas dermatan sulfate was inactive at concentrations less than or equal to 1 mg/ml. Heparan sulfate from human aorta, chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid had little or no activity with either HCII or ATIII. The second order rate constant for the thrombin-HCII reaction reached a maximum value of 6.4 X 10(8) M-1 min-1 in the presence of 250-500 micrograms/ml of dermatan sulfate compared to 3.8 X 10(8) M-1 min-1 in the presence of 40-80 micrograms/ml of heparin. When 125I-thrombin was incubated with plasma in the presence of greater than or equal to 100 micrograms/ml of dermatan sulfate, the protease became complexed exclusively with HCII, suggesting that HCII is the only thrombin inhibitor in human plasma that can be activated by dermatan sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W2110277363,"A 3' untranslated region subclone from a human beta-tubulin cDNA clone has been used to dissect the human beta-tubulin multigene family. Four different beta-tubulin sequences were obtained. One consists of an expressed gene that yields two mRNA species of 1.8 kb and 2.6 kb as a consequence of alternative polyadenylation sites. The three remaining beta-tubulin sequences are all intronless pseudogenes, each containing a 3' poly(A) tract downstream from the poly(A) signal, and each flanked by a different short direct repeat. Two of these sequences were derived by integration into the host germ line of cDNA copies of the 1.8 kb mRNA; the third was derived from the 2.6 kb mRNA. Comparison of the functional and nonfunctional sequences suggests that the integration events took place 4, 10, and 13 million years ago. We anticipate that, in multigene families where germ-line expression occurs, a significant portion of sequences will be accounted for by pseudogenes generated via an RNA intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1983122156,"A modified cloning method designed to produce differential complementary DNA libraries permits the isolation of sequences that are present in the RNA population of any developmental stage or tissue, but are not present or are much less abundant in another stage or tissue. Selective complementary DNA cloning is especially useful when the differentially expressed RNA's are of low to moderate abundance in the cells in which they occur. A class of cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA's differentially expressed in gastrula embryos of Xenopus laevis (DG RNA's) has been isolated. These DG RNA's occur very rarely or not at all in unfertilized eggs and blastulae, accumulate as the result of transcription before and during gastrulation, and, with some exceptions, decline in abundance as development proceeds. Many of these RNA molecules appear to be translated at the gastrula stage. Thus, DG RNA's may encode proteins that are important in the process of gastrulation."

https://openalex.org/W1242305241,"Increased intracellular production of oxygen radicals is a major etiology of cell damage from many quinoid antibiotics, environmental toxicants, and hyperoxia. Enhancing the intracellular content of protective enzymes can provide a means of limiting biological damage caused by free radicals. Liposomal entrapment and intracellular delivery of superoxide dismutase to cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells increased the specific activity of cellular superoxide dismutase 6 to 12-fold. This augmented superoxide dismutase activity persisted in cultured endothelial cell monolayers and rendered these cells resistant to oxygen-induced injury. Culture of confluent endothelial cells in hyperoxia increased 51Cr and lactate dehydrogenase release in an oxygen concentration-dependent manner. Superoxide dismutase-augmented endothelial cells were resistant to oxygen damage compared to untreated controls, in a superoxide dismutase concentration-dependent manner. Free superoxide dismutase in the absence or presence of liposomes containing no enzyme had no effect on cellular enzyme activity and did not protect from oxygen damage. Liposomes made from saturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids had a small but significant protective effect on oxygen-induced cell damage. These liposomes probably increased endothelial cell membrane saturated lipid content and thereby decreased peroxidative damage when the cells were exposed to hyperoxia. Conversely, preincubation of cells with arachidonic acid increased cell arachidonic acid content, sensitivity to hyperoxia, and hyperoxia-induced production of thiobarbituric acid material. These data suggest that intracellular delivery of superoxide dismutase prevents oxygen-induced cell damage and that superoxide is an important mediator of cellular oxygen toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1576179705,"A monoclonal antibody directed against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase and a cDNA to reductase mRNA were used to study the subunit structure of the enzyme and the regulation of its mRNA in rat liver. Although the monoclonal antibody and the cDNA were made with materials from cultured hamster cells, the two reagents cross-reacted with reductase protein and mRNA from rat liver. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody, the subunit molecular weight of rat liver reductase was 90,000. When the enzyme was solubilized from microsomes by freeze-thawing, the subunit molecular weight was reduced to 52,000-58,000, owing to proteolysis. This proteolysis was inhibited by EGTA and leupeptin. The cDNA probe for reductase, radiolabeled with 32P, hybridized to restriction fragments of genomic DNA from rat liver, as visualized by Southern blot analysis. In the livers of control rats, no reductase mRNA was detected when the 32P-cDNA was blot-hybridized to poly(A+) RNA. Hepatic reductase activity was increased 45-fold when rats were fed cholestyramine and mevinolin. Under these conditions, the amount of immunodetectable reductase protein rose by 33-fold, and the reductase mRNA became visible by blot hybridization as a band of approximately 4 kilobases in length. When the mevinolin/cholestyramine-treated rats were fed cholesterol, reductase activity and immunodetectable protein declined markedly and the reductase mRNA was reduced to barely detectable levels. We conclude that treatment with cholestyramine and mevinolin increases the amount of reductase protein in rat liver by elevating the amount of its mRNA and that cholesterol feeding to such induced rats lowers the amount of hepatic reductase protein by decreasing the level of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1539653470,"Glucocorticoid-sensitive L-cells were cultured for 18 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate and steroid-binding proteins of cytosol were separated by affinity chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. Cytosol contains a major phosphoprotein of Mr = 92,000 and a minor phosphoprotein of Mr = 100,000, both of which bind glucocorticoids in a stereospecific, high affinity manner and have the same Mr as glucocorticoid receptor species that have been covalently labeled with the site-specific affinity ligand [3H] 9 alpha-fluoro-16-methyl-11 beta,17 alpha,21-trihydroxypregna-1, 4-diene-3,20-dione 21-mesylate. Cytosol from 32P-labeled, glucocorticoid-resistant L-cells possessing 5% of the steroid-binding capacity of sensitive cells contains very little of the Mr = 92,000 phosphoprotein and none of the Mr = 100,000 phosphoprotein. These observations provide strong evidence that the glucocorticoid receptor is phosphorylated by intact L-cells. The Mr = 92,000 protein is phosphorylated on serine and it can be resolved into two species using isoelectric focusing, consistent with the proposal that there is more than 1 phosphorylated serine/steroid-binding unit. The glucocorticoid-resistant L-cell line produces a unique phosphoprotein of Mr = 104,000 that is recovered in variable amounts after affinity chromatography. It is not known whether this phosphoprotein is a separate gene product or whether it represents a precursor with weak steroid-binding activity that is not cleaved in the resistant cell to the high affinity, Mr = 92,000 mature receptor form."

https://openalex.org/W1967606691,"Three types of tumors termed plasmacytomas (ABPC's), lymphosarcomas (ABLS's), and plasmacytoid lymphosarcomas (ABPL's) arise in BALB/c mice treated with pristane and Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). While most ABPC's and BLS's contain integrated A-MuLV proviral genome and synthesize the v-abl RNA, most ABPL's do not. The ABPL tumors were examined for the expression of other oncogenes that may be associated with their transformed state, in the absence of transforming virus. These tumors expressed abundant c-myb RNA of unusually large size and showed DNA rearrangements of the c-myb locus."
https://openalex.org/W1567923621,"Isolation of pea lectin from immature seeds, together with in vivo pulse-chase labeling and in vitro translation of RNA from such seeds, all gave results which indicated strongly that pea lectin is initially synthesized as a large precursor (pre-pro-form) (Mr = 25,000) which is cleaved both co- and post-translationally to yield the alpha and beta subunits of mature lectin. Two overlapping cDNA plasmids complementary to lectin mRNA were sequenced. They coded for both beta and alpha subunits of lectin, in the orientation beta leads to alpha from the NH2 terminus, together with a hydrophobic NH2-terminal leader sequence and included a 3' untranslated region of 124 nucleotides. In the appropriate reading frame, no stop codon was found between the coding sequences for the beta and alpha subunits, confirming the synthesis of pea lectin via a pre-pro-form. The entire pea lectin sequence showed a high degree of homology with the published amino acid sequences of lectins from lentil, broad bean, and, to a lesser extent, with concanavalin A from jack bean. Sequence variation occurred mainly in those regions thought not to be involved in metal- and sugar-binding or in the formation of beta-pleated sheets."
https://openalex.org/W2121530849,"Plasminogen activator (PA) production in LLC-PK1 pig kidney cell culture is induced to high levels by calcitonin and vasopressin, both of which stimulate adenylate cyclase, or by other compounds that also raise intracellular cAMP levels. Enzyme induction is transiently sensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D, suggesting that increased concentrations of cAMP mediate the inducing effects of the hormones by enhancing the transcription of PA-mRNA sequences. We tested this hypothesis by measuring PA-mRNA sequences in the Xenopus oocyte translation system which showed a 15-20-fold enhanced PA-synthesizing capacity when supplied with poly(A)+RNA from induced cells, above that obtained from uninduced cell RNA. Changes in PA-mRNA levels measured by Northern hybridization using cloned PA-specific cDNA gave results that agreed well with those obtained from translation assays. Pretreatment with high concentrations of cycloheximide did not block calcitonin-induced PA-mRNA synthesis, indicating that PA gene activation was a primary transcriptional result of calcitonin stimulation and did not require new protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1498949169,"A unique sequence in the mouse genome which cross-hybridized to a cloned human interferon-beta 1 gene was detected by DNA blot analysis. Taking advantage of this, a cDNA library prepared from partially purified mRNA for mouse interferon-beta was screened using human interferon-beta 1 DNA as a probe. One of the positive clones, pM beta-3, contained a 680-base pair cDNA insert, whose base sequence contained a single large open reading frame for 182 amino acids. The coding sequences of the cDNA showed homologies of 63% at the nucleotide and 48% at the amino acid level with respect to human interferon-beta 1 cDNA (Taniguchi, T., Ohno, S., Fujii-Kuriyama, Y., and Muramatsu, M. (1980) Gene 10, 11-15). The first 21 amino acids, considered to be the signal peptide, were followed by 24 amino acids, whose sequence was identical with the NH2-terminal sequence that had been reported for mouse interferon-beta from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (Taira, H., Broeze, R. J., Jayaram, B. M., Lengyel, P., Hunkapiller, M. W., and Hood, L. E. (1980) Science (Wash. D.C.) 207, 528-530). The complete primary sequence of mature interferon-beta polypeptide consisting of 161 amino acids (Mr = 19,700) was deduced. There are three N-glycosylation sites, and this offers an explanation for the larger molecular size (Mr = 26,000-40,000) of natural mouse interferon-beta in comparison to the deduced interferon polypeptide. The cDNA, when fused to a SV40 promoter sequence and then introduced into COS-7 cells, directed the synthesis and secretion of a protein product indistinguishable from the authentic mouse interferon-beta."
https://openalex.org/W1543658978,"The terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase EC 4.99.1.1), has been purified to apparent homogeneity from bovine liver mitochondria using a scheme similar to that reported by Taketani and Tokunaga (Taketani, S. and Tokunaga, R. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 12748-12753) for purification of the enzyme from rat liver. The final yield was 49% with a 2000-fold purification. Ferrochelatase has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 40,000 by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and column chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B in the presence of 0.5% sodium cholate. The purified enzyme was only slightly stimulated by added lipid and was inhibited by Mn2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+. Bovine ferrochelatase utilized proto-, meso-, and deuteroporphyrin, but not disubstituted porphyrins (2,4-disulfonic and 2,4-bisglycol deuteroporphyrin). N-Methylprotoporphyrin, a toxic by-product of the metabolism of some drugs, was found to inhibit ferrochelatase in a competitive fashion with respect to porphyrin with a Ki of 7 nM and uncompetitive with respect to iron. Manganese inhibits ferrochelatase competitively with respect to iron (Ki = 15 microM) and noncompetitively with respect to the porphyrin substrate. Heme, one of the products, is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to iron. These findings lead to a sequential Bi Bi kinetic model for ferrochelatase with iron binding occurring prior to porphyrin binding and heme being released prior to the release of two protons."

https://openalex.org/W1505513454,"We studied the interaction at 37 degrees C between a major apolipoprotein of pulmonary surfactant and 11 mixtures of lipids. The experiments were carried out in the presence of either 3 mM Ca2+ or 10 mM EDTA. The amount of apolipoprotein associated with lipid was independent of Ca2+. However the binding was sensitive to the percentage of gel-state lipid in the vesicles, and the amount of apolipoprotein in the recombinant lipoprotein complex decreased as the percentage of fully saturated phospholipid was reduced. Maximum association of the apolipoprotein occurred with lipid vesicles containing 85% 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 15% 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-1-glycerol or 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol. Fluorescence measurements on the apolipoprotein indicated that the tryptophan side chains were in a relatively hydrophobic environment, and that the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission was not changed upon the binding of lipid. The results suggest that the principal mode of interaction between the apolipoprotein and lipids of surfactant is hydrophobic bonding. The most extensive binding occurs with lamellar lipids in a gel that would be expected to have inhomogeneities in packing density due to the presence of acidic phospholipids or other glycerolipids. The role of Ca2+ in this interaction has not been fully determined. Although it is not needed to effect the binding of the lipids and the apolipoprotein, it does influence the physical state of the complex, and possibly the stoichiometry of lipid to protein. Some of the processes mediated by Ca2+ in this interaction may be analogous to those observed in membrane fusion. Thus, Ca2+ probably causes segregation of the lamellar phospholipids into domains, inducing vesicular disruption and fusion. This lipid aggregates about hydrophobic sites on the protein, thereby forming high molecular weight reassembly complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1482782246,"To assess the magnitude of reutilization of surfactant phosphatidylcholine, 68 3-day-old rabbits were injected intratracheally with a trace dose of [3H]choline-labeled surfactant mixed with [14C]palmitate-labeled synthetic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. After timed kills we measured the total phosphatidylcholine associated counts/min in whole lung and alveolar wash and the specific activities of phosphatidylcholine in the alveolar wash, lamellar bodies, and microsomes isolated from the lung of each rabbit. Using a modification of the compartment analysis of Skinner et al. (Skinner, S. M., Clark, R. E., Baker, N., and Shipley, R. A. (1959) Am. J. Physiol. 196, 238-244), we found that surfactant phosphatidylcholine was reutilized with greater than 90% efficiency. The turnover time of the alveolar wash phosphatidylcholine was estimated to be 10.1 h and 9.3 h as measured by the 3H and 14C labels, respectively. From the ratios of alveolar wash-associated natural to synthetic phosphatidylcholine specific activities and from similar ratios obtained in 30 additional rabbits using [14C]choline-labeled natural surfactant and [3H]choline-labeled dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, we showed that phosphatidylcholine was reutilized intact rather than as component parts. Within 6 h of injection, the synthetic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine functioned metabolically as that administered in the form of natural surfactant."

https://openalex.org/W1550470101,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5' untranslated region and the sequence encoding the signal peptide for mRNAs of the chick alpha 1 type I and alpha 1 type III collagen. These sequences were obtained by synthesizing the corresponding cDNAs using as primers either a synthetic oligonucleotide to prime alpha 1 type I cDNA or a DNA fragment isolated from a genomic clone coding for alpha 1 type III collagen to prime the cognate cDNA. Both primers were selected so that the resulting cDNAs would be short and would contain sequence information for the 5' untranslated region and the signal peptide of the proteins. The nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs were compared with the corresponding sequence of alpha 2 type I collagen. In each mRNA the 5' untranslated segment is approximately 130 nucleotides and contains two or more AUG triplets preceding the AUG which serves as a translation initiation codon. A sequence of about 50 nucleotides surrounding the translation initiation codon is remarkably conserved in all three mRNAs, whereas the sequences preceding and following this segment diverge markedly. This homologous sequence contains an almost identical inverted repeat sequence which could form a stable stem-loop structure. The initiation codon and the AUG which precedes it are found at the same place within this symmetrical sequence and the distance between them is invariant. The rest of the conserved sequence shows a less perfect symmetry. This conserved sequence has not been found in other genes. Our data suggest that these three and perhaps other collagen genes contain an identical regulatory signal that may play a role in determining the level of expression of these genes by modulating translational efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1490395880,"Vasopressin and oxytocin are nonapeptide hormones that regulate water metabolism and lactation, respectively. To study the regulation of the vasopressin and oxytocin genes at the mRNA level, we constructed a series of synthetic oligonucleotides, from 8 to 15 bases in length, for use in filter-blot hybridization assays (Northern blots) of hypothalamic mRNA levels and for primed synthesis of cDNAs from which we determined the nucleotide sequences of the 5' regions of the vasopressin and oxytocin mRNAs. A 20-fold increase occurred in the amounts of the two mRNAs present in the hypothalami of rats drinking 2% saline for three weeks. In addition, the sequence analyses of the cDNAs provided the complete amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal signal peptides of the rat vasopressin and oxytocin precursors. Thus, synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of as few as eight nucleotides can be used to prime reverse transcription of specific cDNAs from hypothalamic RNA, and pentadecanucleotide hybridization probes readily detect changes in levels of vasopressin and oxytocin mRNAs in response to osmotic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1498219967,"The results presented in this communication demonstrate that hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) cDNA can be expressed in both Chinese hamster and human fibroblasts deficient in the endogenous gene product at levels permitting normal growth of the transformants. All the elements necessary for this expression are present in a pBR322-derived plasmid containing HPRT cDNA coding sequence and a retroviral long terminal repeat. These molecules function in both species investigated and, at least in the case of the Chinese hamster transformants, are efficient at the single copy level. Although the effects of the presence of intron sequences and a polyadenylation signal within the plasmids have yet to be evaluated, these studies demonstrate that neither is an absolute requirement for expression of HPRT cDNA sequences in cultured mammalian cells. We describe the construction of recombinant plasmids containing wild type human or Chinese hamster HPRT cDNA sequences in tandem with a retroviral LTR which confer the HPRT+ phenotype in HPRT-deficient V79 and Lesch-Nyhan fibroblasts. Both stable and unstable transformants, that expressed HPRT mRNA and protein, were isolated at high frequency."
https://openalex.org/W1526464124,"Abstract Two double-stranded cDNA recombinant pBR322 plasmid libraries were constructed starting from high carbohydrate diet rat liver poly(A)+ mRNA, either fractionated by denaturing sucrose gradient centrifugation for the cloning of L-type pyruvate kinase cDNA, or nonfractionated for aldolase B. Both libraries were screened with single-stranded cDNA probes reverse transcribed from fasted or high carbohydrate diet rat liver mRNAs. mRNAs from fasted animals were also fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation and mRNAs from the fed animals were, in addition, further purified by high performance liquid gel filtration chromatography. Those clones hybridizing with the probe (from animals fed the high carbohydrate diet) and not with the negative one (from fasted animals) were preselected and their plasmid DNA was purified and analyzed by positive hybridization-selection. Thirty of 4500 bacteria colonies transformed by recombinant plasmids were preselected by differential screening for pyruvate kinase, and 8 of 864 colonies for aldolase B. Twenty-two recombinant plasmids for pyruvate kinase and two for aldolase B were shown to contain specific cDNA inserts by positive hybridization-selection. Plasmids DNAs of some pyruvate kinase and aldolase B clones (whose inserts ranged from 700 to 1050 bases in length) were labeled by nick translation and used as probes for Northern blot hybridization. The pyruvate kinase cDNA probes recognized mainly a 3400-base RNA species which was detected in high carbohydrate diet rat liver, but not in fasted rat liver and in tissues which do not synthesize L-type pyruvate kinase. In addition, some pyruvate kinase probes hybridized with minor RNA species of about 2000 bases in length, only observed after carbohydrate diet. For aldolase B, the recombinant plasmid DNA hybridized with a single RNA species of 1750 bases. This RNA, detected in kidney, small intestine and liver, was induced by a high carbohydrate diet and increased with liver development. The rat probe cross-hybridized with human aldolase B messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1600537635,"Phenobarbital (PB) treatment of rats of various strains leads to the accumulation of liver mRNAs which encode two or three immunochemically related but electrophoretically separable cytochrome P-450 polypeptides. These mRNAs hybridize efficiently to a single cloned cDNA derived from mRNA of PB-treated rats and, therefore, must have extensive sequence homology. The nucleotide sequence of this cloned cDNA was determined and shown to encode the COOH-terminal 211 amino acids of one of the major cytochrome P-450 isozymes induced in rat liver by PB. Together with the recently reported sequence data of Fujii-Kuriyama et al. (Fujii-Kuriyama, Y., Mizukami, Y., Kawajiri, K., Sagawa, K., and Muramatsu, M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 2793-2797) for cloned rat cytochrome P-450 cDNA, our data suggest that differences between two closely related P-450 isozymes are restricted to the COOH-terminal half of the polypeptides, with highly divergent regions flanking a tridecapeptide which has been previously shown to be highly conserved in two dissimilar forms of rabbit liver cytochrome P-450. The significance of other interesting features of the cDNA sequence such as a second long (409 residues) open frame, an unusual poly(A) addition signal, and the absence of long hydrophobic stretches in the encoded polypeptide is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599095789,"Homologous DNA fragments were prepared from cloned cDNAs for the pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains of human type I procollagen. The DNA fragments were then used to develop a dot blot hybridization assay for mRNAs for pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains in skin fibroblasts. In normal fibroblasts, the ratio of the steady state levels of the two mRNAs was 1.94 +/- 0.34 S.D. The ratio for the rates of synthesis of the two pro-alpha chains in the same cells was 1.84 +/- 0.13 S.D. Since the two ratios were essentially the same, the results indicated that the mRNAs for the two chains are translated at about the same rates. Therefore, there is no need to invoke translational control or more complex mechanisms to explain synthesis of pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains in a stoichiometry of 2:1. The dot blot hybridization assay was also used to examine the levels of the mRNAs in fibroblasts from several variants of osteogenesis imperfecta. In two of the variants, the ratios of the steady state levels of mRNAs for pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains were 3.05 and 2.52, respectively. In the same fibroblasts, the ratios for the rates of synthesis of the two chains were 2.99 +/- 0.43 and 2.45 +/- 0.16, respectively. Therefore, even though the ratios of the levels of the two mRNAs in the fibroblasts were abnormal, the two mRNAs were still translated at the same rates, and there was no evidence of differential regulation at the translational level."

https://openalex.org/W1583576521,"Using a mixture of synthetic 17-mer oligonucleotides encoding the 64 possible sequences for a peptide of adenosine deaminase as probe, we have isolated a clone for adenosine deaminase mRNA sequences from a collection of T-cell cDNA recombinants. This cDNA clone, phADA-1, contains an insert of 0.8 kilobase. In addition to the peptide chosen for synthesis of the oligonucleotide probe, the complete DNA sequence predicts 16 other experimentally determined peptides. Mapping of total cellular human DNAs with several restriction enzymes revealed relatively simple patterns of hybridization with phADA-1 as probe, including a polymorphism for PvuII cleavage. In agreement with previous studies, the adenosine deaminase gene was localized by blot hybridization to chromosome 20 in a hybrid cell mapping panel. Using the cDNA as probe, an 18-kilobase EcoRI fragment of human cellular DNA was also cloned in bacteriophage Charon 4A. These adenosine deaminase clones will prove valuable in the full characterization of the cellular gene, molecular analysis of inherited enzyme deficiency associated with immunodeficiency, and regional mapping of human chromosome 20."
https://openalex.org/W1571686660,"The binding of the inhibitory ligands fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP to rat liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase has been investigated. 4 mol of fructose-2,6-P2 and 4 mol of AMP bind per mol of tetrameric enzyme at pH 7.4. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate exhibits negative cooperatively as indicated by K'1 greater than K'2 greater than K'3 greater than or equal to K'4 and a Hill plot, the curvature of which indicates K'2/K'1 less than 1, K'3/K'2 less than 1, and K'4/K'3 = 1. AMP binding, on the other hand, exhibits positive cooperativity as indicated by K'1 less than K'2 less than K'3 less than K'4 and an nH of 2.05. Fructose 2,6- and fructose 1,6-bisphosphates enhance the binding of AMP as indicated by an increase in the intrinsic association constants. At pH 9.2, where fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP inhibition of the enzyme are diminished, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binds with a lower affinity but in a positively cooperative manner, whereas AMP exhibits half-sites reactivity with only 2 mol of AMP bound per mol of tetramer. Ultraviolet difference spectroscopy confirmed the results of these binding studies. The site at which fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binds to fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase has been identified as the catalytic site on the basis of the following. 1) Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binds with a stoichiometry of 1 mol/mol of monomer; 2) covalent modification of the active site with acetylimidazole inhibits fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binding; and 3) alpha-methyl D-fructofuranoside-1,6-P2 and beta-methyl D-fructofuranoside-1,6-P2, substrate analogs, block fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binding. We propose that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate enhances AMP affinity by binding to the active site of the enzyme and bringing about a conformational change which may be similar to that induced by AMP interaction at the allosteric site."
https://openalex.org/W1501928068,"The major form of cytochrome P-450 (P-450PCN) was isolated from rats administered pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile (PCN). Messenger RNA coding for P-450PCN was enriched by polysome immunoadsorption and utilized to construct a library of cDNA clones in pBR322. P-450PCN clones were isolated from this library by differential colony hybridization using [32P]cDNA probes transcribed from PCN-induced and PCN-induced P-450PCN immunoenriched poly(A) RNA. The P-450PCN clone with the largest cDNA insert (pP450PCN-10) was verified to contain sequences complementary to P-450PCN mRNA by hybrid selection-translation. pP450PCN-10 was composed of approximately 1900 base pairs and had a restriction map that overlapped at least 3 other cDNA clones selected by differential colony hybridization. Denaturing-agarose gel electrophoresis and nitrocellulose blot-hybridization using nick-translated 32P-labeled pP450PCN-10 indicated that pP450PCN mRNA is 2500 +/- 150 nucleotides in length; pP450PCN-10, therefore, represents approximately 76% of its corresponding mRNA sequence. Southern blot analysis of rat DNA using pP450PCN revealed that approximately 50 to 60 kilobases of DNA reacted with the PCN probe, suggesting the P-450PCN gene is either a very large gene or other genomic segments exist that react with the probe, such as pseudogenes or related P-450 genes that share homology. The mechanism of P-450PCN induction was examined by isolating poly(A) RNA at various times after steroid administration and quantitating for P-450PCN mRNA using pP450PCN-10 as a hybridization probe. PCN administration produced a rapid elevation of P-450PCN mRNA which reached maximal levels (7-fold above control) 12 h after administration. In contrast, cytochrome P-450b mRNA, which is readily induced by phenobarbital, was only slightly elevated (approximately 2-fold) after PCN administration."
https://openalex.org/W1519455435,"GH4C1 cells, which possess specific cytosolic binding for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), have previously been found to respond to this hormone with a highly selective increase in prolactin synthesis. Here we extend our previous observations by measuring the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the accumulation of specific mRNA in GH4C1 cells, using cytoplasmic dot hybridization. In a hormone-free, chemically defined medium containing 0.4 mM Ca2+, stimulation of prolactin mRNA accumulation was 200-215% of control after 96 h of treatment with 1 X 10(-9) M 1,25-(OH)2D3. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (1 X 10(-7) M) caused a similar increase in prolactin mRNA (206% of control). Neither hormone increased growth hormone mRNA. Stimulation of prolactin mRNA by 1,25-(OH)2D3 was 163% of control after 48 h and 200% after 96 h. No consistent effect was observed in the first 24 h of treatment. The same response to 48 h treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3 was observed whether the cells were withdrawn from serum-containing medium for 24 h (as above) or 72 h. In cells withdrawn for 96 h, 1,25-(OH)2D3 raised prolactin mRNA within 24 h. The effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was significant at a concentration of 10(-11) M, and half-maximal at approximately 10(-10) M. In low-Ca2+ medium, the response to greater than 10(-10) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 was eliminated. Extracellular Ca2+ (0.4 mM) increased prolactin mRNA in the presence of, but not in the absence of, 1,25-(OH)2D3. These findings demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced prolactin gene expression with a distinctive time course and interactively with calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1568466499,"A lymphosarcoma cell line designated P1798.S6M has been characterized with respect to glucocorticoid responsiveness in culture. Cells ceased to proliferate in the presence of 10(-7) M dexamethasone. Cell viability remained high and glucocorticoid-sensitive cells could be rescued from cultures treated with dexamethasone for 24 or 48 h. These data indicate that P1798.S6M undergoes reversible arrest in the presence of dexamethasone. The system was used to study the effects of mitotic arrest upon transcription of rDNA. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]methionine into rRNA was rapidly inhibited and pulse-chase experiments indicated that 28 S RNA was not synthesized after 24 h of exposure to dexamethasone. Hybridization studies indicated that the amount of pre-rRNA was reduced by 90 to 95% in cells treated for 24 h. Transcription studies were carried out in isolated nuclei. Twenty-four hours after addition of dexamethasone, template-bound RNA polymerase I activity decreased by 89 to 96%. Total RNA polymerase I activity did not decrease, whereas disengaged nuclear polymerase I activity increased dramatically. Filter hybridization studies indicated that labeling of nascent pre-rRNA chains in vitro was inhibited 93%. These data are interpreted as follows: Dexamethasone reversibly inhibits proliferation of P1798.S6M cells and transcription of rDNA. Total RNA polymerase I activity does not decrease, but the amount of template-bound enzyme is reduced with a concomitant increase in the amount of disengaged polymerase I. This indicates that initiation of transcription is inhibited in cells undergoing mitotic arrest in the presence of dexamethasone."
https://openalex.org/W1647205551,"Anephric, vitamin D-deficient male rats were injected with a physiologic dose of 25-hydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 (specific activity of 160 Ci/mmol), and 18-20 h later, intestine, bone, and serum were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for 1,25-dihydroxy-[26,27-3H]vitamin D3. Identical studies were carried out using sham-operated rats and rats with ligated ureters. No 1,25-dihydroxy[26,27-3H]vitamin D3 was detected in the tissues from anephric rats, while large amounts were detected in sham-operated and ureteric ligated controls. This result demonstrates that in the nonpregnant rat, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is either not synthesized or is synthesized in vanishingly small amounts in bone and intestine in vivo, casting considerable doubt of the physiological importance of reports of in vitro synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 by cells in culture derived from bone and elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2130725265,"A cDNA clone coding for the cell attachment domain in human fibronectin has been isolated using synthetic oligonucleotides. Three sets of mixed tetradecamer oligonucleotides were synthesized based on amino acid sequences in the 108-amino acid cell attachment domain (Pierschbacher, M. D., Ruoslahti, E., Sundelin, J., Lind, P., and Peterson, P. A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9593-9597). One of these sets was made complementary to amino acids located near the COOH terminus of the cell attachment domain and synthesized as a mixture of 24 sequences. This oligonucleotide mixture was used to prime cDNA synthesis with mRNA prepared from a human fibrosarcoma as a template. A cDNA library was constructed with the oligonucleotide-primed sequences in the vector pBR322. Colonies that hybridized with the primer were isolated from the library and further identified by hybridization with oligonucleotides deduced from an amino acid sequence located 45 amino acid residues NH2-terminal of the primer sequence. One clone which hybridized to both probes was characterized in detail. The insert was 380 base pairs long and its nucleotide sequence agreed completely with the corresponding amino acid sequence of human plasma fibronectin, showing that the sequences for this region are identical in plasma fibronectin and fibronectin from a cell line. This clone should be useful for studies on the expression of fibronectins and may also allow for the production of the biologically active cell attachment domain of fibronectin in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1648850547,"A series of analogues of cholesterol, each having a shortened side chain and a primary amine group, were prepared and tested for their effects on bovine adrenocortical cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc). A previous study had shown that one derivative, 22-amino-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol, is a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme and forms a complex in which the steroid ring binds to the cholesterol site and the side chain amine forms a bond with the heme iron (Sheets, J. J., and Vickery, L. E. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 5773-5777). In the studies reported here, the 23-amine derivative, 23-amino-24-nor-5-cholen-3 beta-ol, was found to be an equally potent inhibitor and to be competitive with respect to cholesterol (Ki = 38 nM). Binding of the 23-amine to P-450scc also caused formation of a low spin complex with an absorption maximum at 422 nm, indicative of a nitrogen-donor ligand. Other derivatives in which the side chain amine was linked closer to the steroid, 17 beta-amino-5-androsten-3 beta-ol and (20 R + S)-20-amino-5-pregnen-3 beta-ol, were found to be only very weak inhibitors (I50 greater than 100 microM) and did not produce the 422 nm spectral form when bound. Derivatives in which the amine was attached a greater distance from the steroid ring, 24-amino-5-cholen-3 beta-ol and 25-amino-26,27-bisnor-5-cholesten-3 beta-ol, caused a progressive decrease in inhibitory potency and a failure to produce the 422 nm form on binding. The dependence of the type of interaction of these amino-steroids with P-450scc upon the amine position establishes that the steroid binding site and the heme catalytic site of the enzyme are fixed within a specific distance of one another. The heme appears to be located sufficiently close to the position that the side chain of cholesterol would occupy to allow for direct attack of an iron-bound oxidant to occur during hydroxylation and side chain cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1517127186,"Differentiation of quail myoblasts, isolated from thigh pectoralis and anterior latissimus dorsi muscle, was analyzed in primary cultures and in cultures obtained following repeated subculturing. Our study shows that quail myoblasts can survive many generations without losing their ability to form myotubes. However, during these subcultures the cells progressively express a new phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by a mixture of myosin light chains such that LC1F, LC2F, and LC2S are present in roughly equimolar amounts, each accounting for 25 to 30% of the total light chain synthesis while LC1S accounts for the remaining 10 to 15%, and by a mixture of fast and slow alpha tropomyosin in which alpha S accounts for 10 to 15% of the alpha subunits synthesis. Clonal analysis indicates that all cells in the population express this phenotype which is also characteristic of subcultures obtained from both future fast and slow muscles. Relationships between this phenotype and muscle development are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2137626260,"Protein C, a vitamin K-dependent protein, circulates in plasma as an inactive precursor. Once activated, it possesses potent anticoagulant activity through the inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa. Thrombin, the only known physiologic activator of this protein, is catalytically inefficient. Thrombomodulin, a protein purified from rabbit lungs, has been reported to enhance protein C activation by thrombin. We have previously demonstrated that factor Va, a substrate for activated protein C, is also a thrombin cofactor in the activation of protein C (Salem, H.H., Broze, G.J., Miletich, J. P., and Majerus, P.W. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1584-1588). When factor Va is fractionated to its individual components, only the light chain (Mr 78,000) has thrombin cofactor activity. Although factor Va and thrombomodulin can both stimulate thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation, the physiological relationship between these two proteins remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1598874243,"The relationship between nuclear binding of glucocorticoid-receptor complex and casein gene expression was studied in organ culture of the whole mammary gland of the mouse. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was used as a modulatory agent for measuring nuclear binding of the receptor complex. Addition of 2 mM and 5mM pyridoxal-5'-P in the medium (Waymouth's MB752/1) resulted in 4- and 12-fold increase of its concentration in the glands incubated with insulin, prolactin, and hydrocortisone. Pyridoxal-5'-P also caused a 52% and 92% inhibition of nuclear binding of [3H]dexamethasone in the glands at 2 mM and 5 mM concentration in the presence of the same hormones in the medium. Corresponding to the reduced nuclear binding of the receptor complex casein mRNA levels, measured by a specific cDNA probe was reduced 86% and over 90% in the glands exposed to 2 mM and 5 mM pyridoxal-5'-P, respectively, in presence of insulin, prolactin, and hydrocortisone in the medium. Withdrawal of pyridoxal-5'-P from the medium restored nuclear binding of the receptor complex near the level of control glands incubated only with the hormones. mRNA casein levels also increased in the gland in the pyridoxal-5'-P-free medium containing the same hormones. This indicates that pyridoxal-5'-P does not alter the specific hormone responsiveness of the mammary cells and its action mediated at the level of the glucocorticoid receptor can influence hormone-inducible expression of the casein genes. Thus, glucocorticoid plays a major role in the multiple hormone regulation of the milk protein gene(s). The findings also suggest that the breast tissue concentration of the vitamin B6 derivative may influence the physiology of lactation in nursing mothers."
https://openalex.org/W1511857931,"The effect of altering the lipid composition of the brush-border membrane on the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) to stimulate calcium transport across the intestinal mucosa was examined by raising chicks on a vitamin D, essential fatty acid-deficient diet (-DEFAD) and measuring calcium absorption from duodenal sacs in situ and calcium uptake into brush-border membrane vesicles in vitro. Administration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to -DEFAD and to -D control chicks led to the same increase in calcium transport in situ, whereas calcium transport in isolated brush-border membrane vesicles was not stimulated in the EFAD group, but responded normally in the control group. When the incubation temperature was increased to 34 degrees C, brush-border membrane vesicles from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated essential fatty acid-deficient (+DE-FAD) chicks accumulated calcium at a faster rate than did vesicles from -DEFAD chicks. There was a marked decrease in the linoleic acid content and an increase in the oleic acid content of both the total lipid extract of the brush-border membrane as well as the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions, which could explain the temperature sensitivity of the in vitro system. When the diet of the EFAD chicks was supplemented with linoleic acid, the rate of calcium uptake into subsequently isolated vesicles from +DE-FAD chicks correlated with the amount of linoleic acid in the brush-border membranes. These results support the concept that the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on membrane lipid turnover and structure plays a critically important role in the 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated cellular transport responses."
https://openalex.org/W1544500426,"Dialkyl lecithins are nonhydrolyzable substrate analogues for phospholipase A2 (Naja naja naja). Short chain dialkyl lecithins (which form monomers and micelles), and long chain ether-linked lecithins (which form bilayers or can be solubilized in detergent micelles) have been used to study phospholipase A2/phospholipid interactions. The results of gel filtration, 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy, kinetic assays and UV difference spectroscopy show that binding of the ether-linked lecithins is independent of metal ion in pure lecithin systems (monomer, micelle, or bilayer), but requires Ca2+ for tight binding when Triton X-100 is used to solubilize the lecithin in mixed micelles. The apparent KD for dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine is 2 mM in sonicated vesicles, but is increased to 6 mM in Triton-mixed micelles in the presence of Ca2+. When phospholipase A2 binds monomeric and micellar dialkyl lecithin, the lecithin phosphate resonance is broadened considerably, indicating that head group motion is restricted. Ca2+ enhances this interaction with the head group in these pure lipid systems. In similar 31P NMR experiments with dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine solubilized in Triton X-100 mixed micelles, phospholipase A2 does not cause comparable broadening of the phosphate resonance, even in the presence of Ca2+ where gel filtration shows binding occurs. The kinetic effect of the ether-linked lipid inhibitors on phospholipase activity toward ester-linked lecithins is also modulated by the presence of Triton X-100. Ether-linked lecithins are much more potent inhibitors in two-component (dialkyl- diacyl-) lecithin micelles and bilayers than in complex mixed micelles with Triton X-100. Detergent-induced changes in the characteristics of the micellar interface are implicated in this inhibition phenomenon. The interaction of phospholipase A2 with sonicated vesicles of dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine has also been examined by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. When phospholipase A2 binds to vesicles, it promotes loss of encapsulated lanthanide ions, and appears to accelerate transbilayer phospholipid flip-flop rates. These results are discussed in terms of membrane asymmetry studies using phospholipase A2."
https://openalex.org/W1589892405,"Rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulate radioactivity when incubated with 17 microM L[4,5-3H]leucine methyl ester; only low levels of accumulation are observed when the cells are incubated with equivalent amounts of labeled D-leucine methyl ester or the free amino acid, L-leucine. More than 98% of the intracellular radioactivity of cells incubated with leucine methyl ester is in the form of leucine. When cells that had been preincubated with L-leucine methyl ester were disrupted by sonication, 72% of the intracellular radioactivity could be trapped on glass fiber filters, indicating that the leucine had accumulated within a particulate intracellular compartment. Granule preparations obtained from the polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulated leucine in the presence of leucine methyl ester in a manner similar to the intact cells. Separation by density gradient centrifugation of the granules obtained from cells preincubated with labeled leucine methyl ester revealed a nearly exact correspondence between the density distribution of accumulated radioactivity and that for beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme localized with the azurophilic subpopulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte granules; there was no such correspondence with the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a marker for the specific granules. The results indicate that the azurophilic granules represent the intracellular site of leucine accumulation by the intact cells. This conclusion is supported by the effects of millimolar concentrations of amino acid methyl ester, which cause a dramatic loss of latency for the activities of the azurophilic granule enzymes beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase but have no effect upon the latency of the specific granule enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Leucine accumulation by the intact cells is 80% inhibited by 0.1 mM chloroquine and 50% inhibited by 20 mM NH4Cl and methylamine, lysosomotropic agents that elevate the intralysosomal pH. These observations suggest that the azurophilic granules of these cells, generally considered to be primary lysosomes, are internally acidified."
https://openalex.org/W1526754461,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a cloned cDNA derived from the mRNA encoding an abundant Xenopus laevis tadpole beta-globin polypeptide. The cloned sequence contains the entire coding region of the mRNA as well as most of its 5'- and 3' -noncoding regions. The complete amino acid sequence of the protein has been deduced. Comparison of this sequence with that of the major adult beta-globin polypeptide of X. laevis shows that the two gene products are highly diverged from each other, the tadpole sequence actually displaying a somewhat greater homology to the human beta-like globin sequences than to the adult frog sequence. An unusual feature of the predicted tadpole beta-globin polypeptide is the presence of a phenylalanine residue at its carboxyl terminus. All known amphibian, avian, and mammalian beta-globin polypeptides have a COOH-terminal histidine residue, and this amino acid is known to play a major role in the alkaline Bohr effect. This observation suggests that, as has been found for two fish hemoglobins which also have a COOH-terminal phenylalanine residue, the tadpole hemoglobin of X. laevis will display a much reduced alkaline Bohr effect."
https://openalex.org/W1499559318,"The vitamin K-dependent production of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein occurs in the kidney. This protein, which we will call KGP, has no assigned physiological role. In the experiments described here, the effects of the calcium-regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), on the renal vitamin K-dependent carboxylation system were studied. PTH, when administered via continuous infusion at 3 units/h using a subcutaneous osmotic pump, caused a time-dependent increase in the activity of the renal gamma-glutamyl carboxylase which was detectable after 2 days and continued to increase up to day 7 of infusion. The increase was more marked in thyroparathyroidectomized rats than in intact rats, suggesting the possibility of an antagonistic action by endogenous calcitonin. Treatment of intact rats with 1,25-(OH)2D3 by daily intraperitoneal injections also caused a time-dependent increase in the activity of the carboxylase. When the warfarin-mediated accrual in renal microsomes of the precursor of KGP was measured, treatment with either parathyroid hormone plus warfarin or 1,25-(OH)2D3 plus warfarin caused a significant increase in precursor relative to animals treated with warfarin alone. Thus, the synthesis of KGP is modulated by these two calcium regulating hormones both by increasing the synthesis of KGP precursor as well as by increasing the activity of the carboxylase enzyme which catalyzes post-translational modification of the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1603359280,"The effects of the cholesterol analogue, (20R)-20-phenyl-5-pregnene-3 beta,20-diol (20-PPD), on the catalytic and spectral properties of purified bovine adrenocortical cytochrome P-450scc were investigated. In contrast to results with cholesterol and (20R)-20-hydroxycholesterol, no conversion of 20-PPD to pregnenolone could be detected; instead, 20-PPD was found to be a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P-450scc. Kinetic analyses showed that the inhibition is reversible and competitive with respect to cholesterol with an apparent Ki = 30nM. Spectral binding studies with ferricytochrome P-450scc showed that 20-PPD formed a 1:1 complex with the enzyme, having an absorption spectrum similar to that produced by (20R)-20-hydroxycholesterol. These results indicate that 20-PPD binds with very high affinity to the substrate site on cytochrome P-450scc. The finding that the phenyl side chain is readily accommodated suggests the presence in this site of an open pocket which may be normally occupied by C-22 to C-27 of the cholesterol side chain."
https://openalex.org/W1491902310,"Cell-free translation was used to initially characterize the major mRNA species present in the bovine anterior pituitary as a function of development. The only detectable change in translation products, which occurred during the transition from fetus to adult, was a reversal in the relative ratio of pituitary growth hormone and prolactin. Subsequent hybridization analysis with cloned growth hormone and prolactin cDNA probes indicated that growth hormone mRNA comprised over 40% of the total fetal mRNA and was 50- to 100-fold higher than prolactin mRNA. The steady state levels of growth hormone mRNA remained relatively constant throughout gestation. In contrast, prolactin mRNA levels, which were low early in gestation, increased during development to become the principal mRNA in the adult pituitary. Since growth hormone and prolactin are synthesized and secreted by specialized cells (somatotrophs and mammotrophs, respectively) immunochemical staining was used to determine whether the changes in the mRNA levels for these two hormones were a reflection of specific cell proliferation. For growth hormone, there was a close correlation between the number of somatotrophs and the relative levels of growth hormone mRNA. In contrast, the increase in prolactin mRNA exceeded the increase in the number of mammotrophs. Thus, the cellular concentration of growth hormone mRNA remains relatively constant during development, while the cellular concentration of prolactin mRNA increases by more than an order of magnitude."
