https://openalex.org/W2035842337,"Operant-conditioning techniques were employed to produce organized behavior during sleep as defined by the electroencephalographic record. Patterned responding was found in so-called ""light"" and ""deeper"" electroencephalograph stages as well as in the awake record. Results suggest that the use of the electroencephalographic record as a reliable indicator of the sleep-awakefulness continuum be re-examined."

Montmorillonoid-type clay minerals occur in all soils in which disease spread is slow, but, with the exception of two soils, this group of minerals is absent in soils in which it is rapid."

https://openalex.org/W2097419003,An observed effect of longitudinal flow rate through corn roots on phosphate transport is shown to be inconsistent with diffusion theory. R. C. Smith's results confirm rather the existence of a diffusion barrier between the xylem and the free space external to the central cylinder of the root.
