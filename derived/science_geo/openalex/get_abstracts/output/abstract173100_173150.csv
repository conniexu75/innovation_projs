https://openalex.org/W2057702599,"The structure of the membrane protein formate dehydrogenase-N (Fdn-N), a major component of Escherichia coli nitrate respiration, has been determined at 1.6 angstroms. The structure demonstrates 11 redox centers, including molybdopterin-guanine dinucleotides, five [4Fe-4S] clusters, two heme b groups, and a menaquinone analog. These redox centers are aligned in a single chain, which extends almost 90 angstroms through the enzyme. The menaquinone reduction site associated with a possible proton pathway was also characterized. This structure provides critical insights into the proton motive force generation by redox loop, a common mechanism among a wide range of respiratory enzymes."

To examine the role of the mannose receptor (MR) in glycoprotein clearance, we generated mice genetically deficient in MR. MR-/- mice were defective in clearing proteins bearing accessible mannose and N-acetylglucosamine residues and had elevated levels of eight different lysosomal hydrolases. Proteomic analysis of MR-/- and control mouse sera showed that an additional 4 out of 52 proteins identified were elevated in MR-/- serum. Each of these is up-regulated during inflammation and wound healing. Thus, MR appears to operate as an essential regulator of serum glycoprotein homeostasis."

Using a murine model for river blindness in which soluble extracts of filarial nematodes were injected into the corneal stroma, we demonstrated that the predominant inflammatory response in the cornea was due to species of endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria. In addition, the inflammatory response induced by these bacteria was dependent on expression of functional Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on host cells."
https://openalex.org/W1990389323,"Neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs throughout elaborate dendritic trees. Here we determine the somatic impact of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) generated at known dendritic sites in neocortical pyramidal neurons. As inputs became more distal, somatic EPSP amplitude decreased, whereas use-dependent depression increased. Despite marked attenuation (>40-fold), when coactivated within a narrow time window (approximately 10 milliseconds), distal EPSPs could directly influence action potential output following dendritic spike generation. These findings reveal that distal EPSPs are ineffective sources of background somatic excitation, but through coincidence detection have a powerful transient signaling role."
https://openalex.org/W1993383413,"Singlet diradicals are usually not energy minima. As observed by femtosecond spectroscopy, they readily couple to form final sigma bonds. Substituent effects allow lifetimes to increase into the microsecond range. Taking advantage of the properties of hetero-elements, a diradical has been prepared that is indefinitely stable at room temperature. The availability of diradicals that can be handled under standard laboratory conditions will lead to further insight into their chemical and physical properties, raising the likelihood of practical applications, especially in the field of molecular materials such as electrical conductors and ferromagnets."
https://openalex.org/W1994861290,"We analyzed the ordered recruitment of factors to the human alpha1 antitrypsin promoter around the initial activation of the gene during enterocyte differentiation. We found that a complete preinitiation complex, including phosphorylated RNA pol II, was assembled at the promoter long before transcriptional activation. The histone acetyltransferases CBP and P/CAF were recruited subsequently, but local histone hyperacetylation was delayed. After transient recruitment of the human Brahma homolog hBrm, remodeling of the neighboring nucleosome coincided with transcription initiation. The results suggest that, at this promoter, chromatin reconfiguration is a defining step of the initiation process, acting after the assembly of the Pol II machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2001497420,"We previously described two mammalian secreted proteins, prokineticin 1 and prokineticin 2, that potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Prokineticin 1 has also been shown to promote angiogenesis by stimulating proliferation, migration, and fenestration of endocrine organ-derived endothelial cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of two closely related G protein-coupled receptors as receptors for prokineticins. Expression of prokineticin receptors in heterologous systems shows that these receptors bind to and are activated by nanomolar concentrations of recombinant prokineticins. Activation of prokineticin receptors leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of p44/p42 MAPK signaling pathways that are consistent with the effects of prokineticins on smooth muscle contraction and angiogenesis. mRNA expression analysis reveals that prokineticin receptors are expressed in gastrointestinal organs, endocrine glands, and other tissues.

Understanding the physiological functions and mechanisms of action of GI motility regulatory factors is a prerequisite for developing effective treatments for GI motility disorders (3Pandolfino J.E.

Peptides. 2000; 21: 1565-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have previously discovered two mammalian proteins, prokineticin 1 and 2 (PK1 and PK2, respectively), that are potentially important regulators of GI motility (5Li M. Bullock C. Knauer D. Ehlert F. Zhou Q.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Prokineticins are ∼10-kDa cysteine-rich secreted proteins expressed in the GI tract and several other tissues. Recently a second function for PK1 was reported. This protein, which LeCouter et al. (6LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.A. Peale F. Gurney A. Killan K.J. Ferrara N.

In addition, expression of PK1 from recombinant adenovirus injected into the mouse ovary stimulates angiogenesis (6LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.A. Peale F. Gurney A. Killan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thus, prokineticins regulate diverse biological functions that include contraction of GI smooth muscle and angiogenesis. Based on pharmacological evidence, we have demonstrated that a receptor(s) for prokineticins belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (5Li M. Bullock C. Knauer D. Ehlert F. Zhou Q.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).

Full-length cDNAs were cloned from Marathon RACE Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) by PCR. The PKR1 gene was amplified from testis Marathon RACE Ready cDNA using PCR and the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-ggtgacatcagccttgcagacattgccc and 5′-ATGTGCATCCAAGCACACTAGTCAGTGTCC. This was followed by nested PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CACCATGGAGACCACCATGGGGTTCATG and 5′-ATGTGCATCCAAGCACACTAGTCAGTGTCC. PKR2 was amplified from pooled testis and fetal brain Marathon RACE Ready cDNA using PCR and the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CACCATGGCAGCCCAGAATGGAAAC and 5′-TGGGTCACTTCAGCCTGATACAGTC. These PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. An aequorin-based luminescent assay for calcium mobilization was used essentially as described previously to measure mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (7An S. Cutler G. Zhao J.J. Huang S.G. Tian H., Li, W. Liang L. Rich M. Bakleh A., Du, J. Chen J.L. Dai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7576-7581Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA3-Aequorin and either PKR1 or PKR2 expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Measurements were recorded using a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Prokineticin-stimulated inositol phosphate production was measured in COS-7 cells following transient transfection of PKR1 and PKR2. Quantification of inositol phosphate was performed as described previously (8Sawyer G.W. Ehlert F.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 464-476PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was monitored by Western blotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). HEK293 parental cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing PKR1 or PKR2 were plated in 24-well tissue culture dishes and serum-starved (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum) for 24 h. Next the spent medium was aspirated, recombinant prokineticins were added, and total cellular extracts were prepared in Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). Twenty micrograms of total protein were loaded per lane and were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant human PK1 and PK2 were purified from Escherichia coli and refolded as described previously (5Li M. Bullock C. Knauer D. Ehlert F. Zhou Q.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Iodination of PK1 was performed by incubating 4.0 μg of PK1 with 50 μg of Iodogen in 50 μl of 0.5 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by transferring the mixture to a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 μl of a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 1 mm NaI and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Free iodine was removed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P2, and the radioactivity in the void volume was measured. Assuming that all radioactivity had been incorporated into the 3.0 μg of PK1 (75% recovery), we calculated the specific radioactivity to be 520–1043 Ci/mmol. For receptor radioligand binding, COS-7 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with PKR1 or PKR2 expression plasmid with the LipofectAMINE method (9Bermak J., Li, M. Bullock C. Zhou Q.-Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were split into 24-well dishes, and binding was carried out 48–72 h after transfection. For saturation binding, 0.03–8.0 nm 125I-labeled PK1 was used. Incubation of radioligand was in α-minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C. Cells were extensively washed and lysed with 1 nNaOH. Radioactivity was measured in a γ counter and analyzed with Prism software. For displacement experiments, various dilutions of unlabeled recombinant prokineticins were added to compete with125I-labeled PK1 (2.0 nm) for binding to cells. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 500 nmunlabeled PK1. Multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) and FirstChoice PCR-Ready cDNA (Ambion) were used as templates in PCRs with primers that amplify only PKR1 or PKR2. One nanogram of cDNA was used per reaction. PKR1 was amplified using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-ggtgacatcagccttgcagacattgccc and 5′-ATGTGCATCCAAGCACACTAGTCAGTGTCC for 40 cycles. The reactions were diluted 50-fold in water, and 5 μl were used in a nested PCR amplification (50-μl total reaction volume) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-ATTCTGAGCAGTGTTGCTCACAGCACCAC and 5′-ATGTGCATCCAAGCACACTAGTCAGTGTCC for an additional 14 cycles. PKR2 was amplified using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CACCATGGCAGCCCAGAATGGAAAC and 5′-TGGGTCACTTCAGCCTGATACAGTC for 40 cycles. The reactions were diluted 50-fold in water, and 5 μl were used in a nested PCR amplification (50-μl total reaction volume) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-CAGTTTCACACCCAACTTTAATCCACCCCAAGACCATG and 5′-ATGTGCATCCAAGCACACTAGTCAGTGTCC for an additional 14 cycles. We previously described pharmacological evidence that the receptor(s) for PK1 and PK2 belongs to the GPCR superfamily (5Li M. Bullock C. Knauer D. Ehlert F. Zhou Q.-Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To identify putative prokineticin receptors, we cloned several novel members of the GPCR superfamily identified by a hidden Markov model (10Baldi P. Chauvin Y. J. Comput. Biol. 1994; 1: 311-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The function of a subset of these GPCRs was tested following transient transfection of their corresponding cDNAs into CHO cells. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was measured using recombinant PK1 (50 nm) as a ligand. Of the GPCRs tested, only two produced PK1-mediated calcium mobilization under these conditions (data not shown). These human receptors are ∼80% identical to the previously described mouse orphan receptor GPR73 (11Parker R. Lui M. Eyre H.J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Crawford J. Sutherland G.R. Jenkins N.A. Herzog H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and were tentatively designated GPR73a and GPR73b. GPR73a and GPR73b share ∼85% amino acid identity and are most divergent in their N-terminal sequences (Fig. 1), with the N terminus of human GPR73a more closely related to mouse GPR73 than to human GPR73b. GPR73a was localized previously to human chromosome region 2p14 (11Parker R. Lui M. Eyre H.J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Crawford J. Sutherland G.R. Jenkins N.A. Herzog H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and GPR73b was localized in silico to chromosome region 20p13. Both GPR73a and GPR73b were activated by recombinant PK1 and PK2 at nanomolar concentrations in transiently transfected CHO cells (Fig. 2, A and B). GPR73a was stimulated by PK1 and PK2 with EC50 (concentration for half-maximal response) values of 2.2 ± 0.7 and 4.3 ± 1.3 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 3), respectively. GPR73b was stimulated by PK1 and PK2 with similar EC50 values of 7.0 ± 1.8 and 7.3 ± 2.8 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 3), respectively. Similar EC50 values were obtained with CHO cells stably expressing GPR73a and GPR73b (data not shown). Because both Gq- and Gi/o-coupled receptors can mediate intracellular calcium mobilization, we further dissected the signaling pathways activated by GPR73a and GPR73b by analyzing the pertussis toxin sensitivity of the calcium response evoked by these two receptors. PK1- and PK2-induced calcium mobilization was not affected by pertussis toxin treatment in transiently transfected CHO cells (data not shown), suggesting that GPR73a and GPR73b couple exclusively to Gq rather than to Gi/o. Furthermore PK1 produced a dose-dependent increase in total inositol phosphate concentration in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with GPR73a and GPR73b (Fig. 2 C). The EC50 values for stimulation of inositol phosphate production were 9.0 ± 1.9 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) and 29.7 ± 4.6 nm (mean ± S.E., n = 3) for GPR73a and GPR73b, respectively. The maximal response was about 2-fold higher in COS-7 cells transfected with GPR73a when compared with cells transfected with GPR73b. The difference may result from the apparently higher expression level of GPR73a in transfected cells when the same amount of GPR73a and GPR73b expression vector DNA was transfected (see receptor binding studies). Finally neither GPR73a nor GPR73b had an effect on stimulation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase (data not shown). Since activation of MAPK is critical for angiogenesis (12Pages G. Milanini J. Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Vinals F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 182-200Google Scholar), we next tested whether the stimulation of GPR73a and GPR73b by PK1 and PK2 activated the p44/p42 MAPK. HEK293 cells stably expressing either GPR73a or GPR73b were incubated with PK1 or PK2 for various time intervals, and phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK was detected using a specific anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibody. PK1 induced a sustained phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK in GPR73a-transfected cells but not in GPR73b-transfected cells (Fig. 2 D). PK2 also stimulated phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK in both GPR73a- and GPR73b-expressing cells although to a lesser extent than that seen with PK1 and GPR73a-expressing cells (Fig. 2 D). To determine the binding affinity of GPR73a and GPR73b for PK1 and PK2, we performed receptor binding assays on transiently transfected cells. Mock-transfected COS-7 cells did not exhibit detectable levels of specific binding of125I-labeled recombinant human PK1. Binding of125I-labeled PK1 to COS-7 cells that expressed GPR73a was saturable, specific, and with high affinity (Kd = 12.3 ± 4.2 nm, Bmax = 11.2 ± 2.27 fmol/105 cells, n = 3). Expression of GPR73b conferred a slightly higher125I-labeled PK1 binding affinity (Kd = 1.8 ± 0.1 nm, n = 3) to the transfected cells, but the receptor level (Bmax= 4.39 ± 1.07 fmol/105 cells, n = 3) was slightly lower than that observed for GPR73a. These data indicated that when the same amount of GPCR expression vector DNA was used in transfections, GPR73a yielded about a 3-fold higher receptor expression level than did GPR73b. The specific binding of 125I-labeled, recombinant PK1 to COS-7 cells expressing GPR73a and GPR73b was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of unlabeled recombinant PK1 and PK2. For GPR73a, the IC50 (concentration for half-maximal inhibition) values were 44.2 ± 4.1 nm (n = 3) and 13.5 ± 0.8 nm (n = 3) for PK1 and PK2, respectively, while for GPR73b, the IC50 values were 34.2 ± 9.0 nm (n = 3) and 4.55 ± 1.40 nm (n = 3) for PK1 and PK2, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicated that both PK1 and PK2 had slightly higher binding affinities for GPR73b compared with GPR73a and that PK2 had a slightly higher affinity for both receptors when compared with PK1. On the basis of these receptor signaling and binding results, GPR73a and GPR73b were renamed PKR1 and PKR2, respectively. To analyze the tissue distribution of PKR1 and PKR2 mRNAs, we performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis on a panel of tissue cDNAs. Both PKR1 and PKR2 were expressed in the small intestine as well as other tissues (Fig. 4). To define more precisely the distribution of PKR1 and PKR2 expression in the digestive tract, reverse transcription-PCR was carried out on cDNA prepared from specific regions of the digestive tract. PKR1 mRNA was localized to the stomach, throughout the small intestine and colon, and to the rectum (Fig. 4). PKR2 mRNA was detected only in the ileocecum. Outside the GI tract, PKR1 and/or PKR2 receptors were expressed in many endocrine tissues, including the thyroid gland, pituitary gland, salivary gland, adrenal gland, testis, and ovary (Fig. 4), where they may function in angiogenesis (6LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.A. Peale F. Gurney A. Killan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). PKR1 and PKR2 mRNA were both detected in the brain, and PKR1 was also expressed in the spleen, prostate, pancreas, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 4). We conclude that we have identified two closely related G protein-coupled receptors as receptors for prokineticins/endocrine gland vascular endothelial growth factor. Prokineticin receptors share 85% sequence identity and common signaling pathways, but we do not yet know whether they have overlapping functions. PKR1 is expressed more abundantly in the GI tract compared with PKR2 and thus may be the major receptor mediating the function of prokineticin in the GI system. The presence of both receptors in several endocrine and non-endocrine tissues and their activation of p44/p42 MAPK may be related to the function of prokineticin in angiogenesis (6LeCouter J. Kowalski J. Foster J. Hass P. Zhang Z. Dillard-Telm L. Frantz G. Rangell L. DeGuzman L. Keller G.A. Peale F. Gurney A. Killan K.J. Ferrara N. Nature. 2001; 412: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), which is essential for a variety of physiological and pathological processes (13Folkman J. Nat.

Marcel Dekker, New York2000Google Scholar). The development and analysis of mice lacking one or both of the prokineticin receptors should help determine the physiological functions of PKR1 and PKR2 in GI motility and angiogenesis. Our findings should also help in the understanding of the regulatory roles of prokineticins in GI motility and angiogenesis by allowing the development of selective agonists and antagonists.

In addition, evidence for neutron emission near 2.5 million electron volts was also observed, as would be expected for deuterium-deuterium fusion.

Krill were concentrated within a band under ice between 1 and 13 kilometers south of the ice edge. Within this band, krill densities were fivefold greater than that of open water. The under-ice environment has long been considered an important habitat for krill, but sampling difficulties have previously prevented direct observations under ice over the scale necessary for robust krill density estimation.

https://openalex.org/W2156597588,"Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) is a receptor for both semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165). To understand the role Npn-1 plays as a receptor for these structurally and functionally unrelated ligands, we set out to identify structural features of Npn-1 that confer binding to Sema3A or VEGF165. We constructed Npn-1 variants containing deletions within the “a” and “b” domains of Npn-1. More than 16 variants were expressed in COS-1 cells and tested for alkaline phosphatase-Sema3A as well as alkaline phosphatase-VEGF165binding. Our results indicate that each of the two Npn-1 CUB domains and the amino-terminal coagulation factor V/VIII domain (CF V/VIII) are essential for Sema3A binding, but only the amino-terminal Npn-1 CF V/VIII domain is required for binding to VEGF165. Guided by the structure of the bovine spermadhesin CUB domain, point mutants targeting defined surfaces of the Npn-1 a1 CUB domain were generated and tested for Sema3A and VEGF165 binding. One Npn-1 variant, Npn-12ABC, exhibits complete loss of Sema3A binding while retaining normal VEGF165 binding. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Npn-12ABC can form a signaling complex with the VEGF165 signaling receptor KDR/VEGFR-2. These results establish the identity of contact sites between Npn-1 and its semaphorin ligands, and they provide a foundation for understanding how Npn-1 functions as a receptor for distinct classes of ligands in vivo.

A complex but ordered series of axon guidance decisions during development is critical for the establishment of nervous system structure and function (1Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar). The vertebrate vascular network is similarly complex, with interconnecting conduits that extend throughout the body that are often in close anatomical proximity to nerve pathways (2Shima D.T. Mailhos C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that at least some of the same ligand-receptor systems coordinate development of both the nervous system and the cardiovascular system. For example, Eph receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, were first characterized as mediators of repulsive guidance events crucial for correct navigation of neuronal growth cones and migrating neural crest cells (3Holder N. Klein R. Development. 1999; 126: 2033-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their unexpected role in blood vessel formation was revealed when mutant mice that lacked either ephrin B2 or its cognate receptor EphB4 were shown to die during embryogenesis due to cardiovascular dysfunction (5Gerety S.S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, ephrin B2 and EphB4 were shown to have a reciprocal expression patterns in arterial and venous endothelial cells (6Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). Another example of a cell surface receptor whose function is required for development of both the cardiovascular and nervous systems is neuropilin-1 (Npn-1). 1The abbreviations used are: Npn-1neuropilin-1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorSema3Asemaphorin 3AIP bufferimmunoprecipitation bufferBSAbovine serum albuminAPalkaline phosphatase Npn-1 was first identified by a monoclonal antibody (called A5) isolated in a screen for cell surface proteins capable of mediating axon guidance decisions during neural development (7Takagi S.

Neuron. 1991; 7: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Since its original characterization, molecular, cellular, genetic, and biochemical analyses have shown that Npn-1 is a multifunctional 130-kDa transmembrane protein capable of binding to distinct ligands belonging to completely unrelated protein families: the semaphorins and VEGFs (9He Z.

Class 3 semaphorins, which include the protein semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), are well characterized members of the semaphorin family. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Npn-1 is the ligand binding component of the Sema3A holoreceptor complex (9He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Npn-1 is expressed in specific classes of developing neurons and is required for repulsive axon guidance mediated by Sema3A (7Takagi S. Tsuji T. Amagai T. Takamatsu T. Fujisawa H. Dev.

Recently, members of the plexin family of large multidomain transmembrane proteins have been shown to physically associate with Npn-1 and together form the functional Sema3A receptor (15Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.-H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 16Tamagnone L.

Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). The Npn-1-plexin A1 complex exhibits an enhanced binding affinity for Sema3A as compared with Npn-1 alone (15Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.-H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmatter S.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and a mouse with a targeted deletion of one plexin, PlexA3, exhibits defects in class 3 semaphorin-mediated axon repulsion (17Cheng H.J. Bagri A. Yaron A. Stein E. Pleasure S.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 249-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). VEGF family members are critical regulators of vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling. The biological effects of VEGFs are mediated by the receptor tyrosine kinases Flt-1 (VEGFR-1), Flk-1/KDR (VEGFR-2), and VEGFR-3 (18Ferrara N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1358-C1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, select isoforms of the VEGF family, including VEGF165, also bind with high affinity to Npn-1 (11Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.-Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Expression of Npn-1 in endothelial cells enhances both affinity labeling of VEGF165 to VEGFR-2 and VEGF165-induced endothelial cell chemotaxis (11Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.-Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 20Miao H.-Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, Npn-1 acts as a VEGF165 co-receptor that augments the ability of VEGF165 to activate VEGFR-2. Npn-1 has also been shown to form a complex with VEGFR-2 (21Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Therefore, Npn-1 serves as a ligand-binding subunit in receptor complexes for structurally distinct ligands, the secreted semaphorins and VEGF165. Consistent with that idea, npn-1 mutant mice exhibit defects in projections of spinal and cranial nerves, and they die during midgestation due to severe cardiovascular dysfunction (22Kawasaki T. Kitsukawa T. Bekku Y. Matsuda Y. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Development. 1999; 126: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Defects observed in these mice could result from a loss of semaphorin-Npn-1 and/or VEGF-Npn-1 signaling. To dissect the molecular mechanisms that contribute to vascular and neuronal functions of Npn-1, we and others have sought to identify structural features of Npn-1 that confer binding to its ligands. Npn-1 has a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a very short cytoplasmic domain (24Fujisawa H. Kitsukawa T. Kawakami A. Takagi S. Shimizu M. Hirata T. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Npn-1 extracellular domain contains two domains with homology to complement components C1r and C1s (CUB domains, also called “a1” and “a2”) at the amino terminus, followed by two coagulation factor V/VIII domains (CF V/VIII, also called “b1” and “b2”), and one C-terminal MAM (meprin, A5, μ-phosphatase) domain (also called “c”). The secreted class 3 semaphorins contain three domains: a long amino-terminal semaphorin domain (sema), which is the signature domain of this family, an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and a positively charged carboxyl-terminal basic domain (25Semaphorin Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1999; 97: 551-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the sema domain of Sema3A can bind to Npn-1 and that it is necessary for Sema3A repulsive activity on neurons. The Sema3A Ig-basic region alone cannot elicit biological activity, although it can bind to Npn-1 with a much lower affinity than the intact Sema3A protein (26Nakamura F. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 27Raper J.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Each of the Npn-1 extracellular domains is required for biological activity mediated by Sema3A (28Chen H., He, Z. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1283-1290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Nakamura F. Tanaka M. Takahashi T. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7870-7880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but only the CUB domains are required for binding to the sema domain of Sema3A. (31Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K.H. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Moreover, a Npn-1 variant lacking both a1 and a2 CUB domains is incapable of binding to Sema3A but does bind to VEGF165. In contrast, deletion of both Npn-1 b domains abolishes binding of both Sema3A and VEGF165 (31Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K.H. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the Npn-1 binding determinants for Sema3A and VEGF165 may be distinct. Here we report the identification of amino acid residues within the Npn-1 CUB domains that are required for Sema3A binding but not VEGF165 binding. We find that amino acid substitutions within two adjacent hydrophilic loops of the amino-terminal Npn-1 CUB domain dramatically reduce binding to class 3 semaphorins without affecting VEGF165 binding. In addition to providing insight into the nature of the interactions between Npn-1 and its distinct ligands, these results establish a foundation for understanding how Npn-1 functions as a receptor for distinct classes of ligands in vivo and may also provide a basis for rational drug design. Npn-1 deletion constructs for ligand-binding assays were created by inverse PCR using the ExSite kit (Stratagene). Full-length rat Npn-1 in the expression vector pMT21 served as a template for PCRs using oligonucleotide pairs that flanked the region of interest, including a1, a2, b1, and b2. The oligonucleotides contained a SalI restriction site at their 5′-ends. Following amplification, inverse PCR products were digested with SalI and circularized by ligation yielding Npn-1 deletion constructs: Δ a1+7 (T30–145E), Δ a2 (146C-274K), Δ b1(275C-370P), and Δ b2 (371C-587V). All cloning sites were sequenced, and the expression of correctly sized Npn-1 deletion mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting. Npn-1 mutation constructs including Npn-12I, Npn-12AB, Npn-12C, Npn-13D, and Npn-12ABC were created by three PCR steps. Full-length Npn-1 in the expression vector pMT21 served as a template for the first two PCRs using two pairs of primers. The 5′ primer from the first pair (nucleotides 6–18) includes a native EcoRI site. The 3′ primer from the first pair and the 5′ primer from the second pair overlap and include the introduced mutations. The 3′ primer from the second pair of primers (nucleotides 2515–2539) contains a native EcoRV restriction site. The mixture of these first two purified PCR products then served as a template for the third PCR, using the 5′ primer from the first pair and the 3′ primer from the second pair. Following amplification, the third PCR product was double-digested with EcoRI/EcoRV and subsequently used to replace the corresponding region of wild type Npn-1 in pMT21. This yielded the following Npn-1 mutation constructs: Npn-12I, Npn-12AB, Npn-12C, and Npn-13D. Mutant Npn-12ABC was created by using Npn-12AB as a template for the first two PCRs, and the same primers were used for generating Npn-12C. All PCR products and cloning sites were sequenced, and the expression of correctly sized Npn-1 mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting. AP-tagged ligands were produced in HEK 293T cells. DNA was introduced into cells by LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Conditioned medium was harvested 48 h posttransfection. Ligand concentration was determined as described (37Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), assuming a specific activity of 2000 units/mg. AP-VEGF cDNA was obtained from Dr. Michael Klagsbrun (Harvard Medical School). VEGF165 used for VEGFR-2 phosphorylation experiments was obtained from Sigma. AP-ligand binding assays were performed as described (31Giger R.J. Urquhart E.R. Gillespie S.K.H. Levengood D.V. Ginty D.D. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1079-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Briefly, Npn-1 constructs were expressed in COS-1 cells following transfection using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were incubated with various AP-tagged ligands or with anti-Npn-1 (anti-b2/c domains) (10Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai U.-T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) for cell surface expression. Bound AP activity values were normalized for protein concentration and Npn-1 cell surface expression levels. The normalized AP values for Npn-1 variants were then reported as percentage binding relative to wild-type Npn-1. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with an expression vector encoding Myc-Plex A1 (4 μg; a gift from Dr. Stephen M. Strittmatter, Yale University) and an expression vector encoding various Npn-1 variants (4 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 2 days, cells were lysed with ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer; 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm polyvinylidene difluoride, 0.3 μmaprotinin, and 10 μm leupeptin). Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The concentration of total soluble proteins was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitations were performed using 0.5 mg of protein in a volume of 0.5 ml to which 2 μl of anti-Myc (9E10) ascites was added. Immunocomplexes were recovered using an excess of protein G-Sepharose (Gammanbind; AmershamBiosciences). Following several washes in IP buffer, proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were electrophoresed through standard SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were then blocked with TBS containing 0.5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with anti-Npn-1 (10Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai U.-T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) polyclonal rabbit IgG (0.5 μg/ml). Then blots were probed with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1:5000), and bound secondary antibody was detected with a chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (Super Signal; Pierce). The same blot was stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at room temperature and reprobed with anti-Myc primary antibody (1:2000 dilution) and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibody. Control lysates from matched samples were prepared without immunoprecipitation and processed identically as the immunoprecipitated samples described above using anti-Npn-1. HEK 293T cells were transfected with expression vector for VEGFR-2 (4 μg; a gift from Dr. Cam Patterson, University of North Carolina), together with an expression vector for various Npn-1 constructs (4 μg) by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, serum-starved (2–3 h, 37 °C), and then treated with 1 nm VEGF for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with IP buffer containing sodium orthovanadate (1 mm), and the samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-Npn-1 (1 μg/ml). Samples were then washed with IP buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBS containing 3% BSA, 1% normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then probed with primary antibody 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine (0.5 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (AmershamBiosciences) secondary antibody. Membranes were stripped and reprocessed for VEGFR-2 normalization using the polyclonal Ab R2.2 (21Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pMT21, pMT21-Npn-1, or pMT21-Npn-12ABC using LipofectAMINE. After 48 h, cells were subjected either to cell surface binding analysis (37Flanagan J.G. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 185-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) or to cell surface Npn-1 immunocytochemistry. Immunocytochemistry was performed without fixation by incubating cells with blocking solution (5% goat serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) for 20 min at 4 °C, followed by anti-Npn-1 (1:250 dilution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% goat serum) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS an additional three times and incubated with secondary Oregon Green 488 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at a dilution of 1:1000. Cells were then visualized under fluorescent microscopy. The iodination of VEGF165 was performed as previously reported (21Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of carrier-free human recombinant VEGF165 was suspended in 90 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. To the reaction tube, 1 mCi of Na125I was added, followed by 40 μl of chloramine T (1 μg/μl in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) and incubated for 1 min. 50 μl of sodium metabisulfite (2 μg/μl in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) was added to stop the reaction. 500 μl of column elution buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) was added to the reaction and transferred to preequilibrated PD-10 column for separation from unreacted iodine. The specific activity was corrected for column recovery and varied from 5,500 to 7,500 Ci/mmol. The saturation analysis was performed as previously reported (21Whitaker G.B. Limberg B.J. Rosenbaum J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25520-25531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-1 cells transiently expressing either the Npn-1 or the Npn-12ABC mutant receptor were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate 24 h prior to experimentation. The following morning, the cells were rinsed with 1 ml of binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% BSA, 25 mm HEPES) and were preequilibrated in the same buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Increasing concentrations (30–5000 pm) of [125I]VEGF165 were added in binding buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentration as follows: leupeptin, 10 μg/ml; antipain, 10 μg/ml; aprotinin, 50 μg/ml; benzamine, 100 μg/ml; soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 μg/ml; bestatin, 10 μg/ml; pepstatin 10 μg/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.3 mm) and 1 μg/ml heparin in the presence or absence of 30 nm unlabeled VEGF165 to estimate nonspecific binding. The nonspecific binding was linear over the indicated tracer concentration range (data not shown). The binding reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium (4 h at 4 °C), and the unbound ligand was removed by washing three times (1 ml) with ice-cold BSA-free binding buffer. The cells were lysed with 250 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaI, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% BSA, 0.1% SDS) and counted using a γ-counter. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values were obtained using the Prism software package, which performs a statistical assessment of goodness of fit to a one-binding site versus a two-binding site model. This methodology is preferred over the Scatchard analysis, since it does not require a transformation and linearization of the data, which is known to distort the experimental errors associated with radioligand-binding data (38Motulsky H.J. Ransnas L.A. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). In all cases described herein, the optimal fit of the data was to a one-binding site model (data not shown). The data points in all curves were determined in triplicate. The lower Bmax value observed for the mutant receptor (as compared with the wild type receptor; see Table I) can be attributed to the lower expression level of mature protein for the mutant receptor in the COS-1 transient expression system (data not shown). The bovine spermadhesin CUB domain was displayed, and side chain was changed to the corresponding residues in Npn-1 using the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Fractional solvent accessibilities were calculated using the program X-PLOR (40Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1., a system for x-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). We set out to identify structural features of Npn-1 that confer binding to VEGF165 and Sema3A, two structurally unrelated ligands with distinct functions. Using a PCR-based mutagenesis approach, we constructed a battery of Npn-1 variants harboring different deletions within the CUB and CF-V/VIII domains. Npn-1 variants lacking individual CUB (a1 or a2) or CF-V/VIII (b1 or b2) domains were generated (Fig. 1 A) and expressed in COS-1 cells. Expression of these variants was confirmed by anti-Npn-1 Western blots and cell surface immunostaining in the absence of detergent. Each variant was tested for its ability to bind to Sema3A and VEGF165 ligands fused at their N termini to alkaline phosphatase (AP-Sema3A and AP-VEGF165). Both of these AP fusion proteins bind with high affinity to Npn-1 (10Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai U.-T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 20Miao H.-Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Fig. 1depicts four of the Npn-1 deletion variants and their AP-Sema3A and AP-VEGF165 binding properties. Deletion of either the a1 or a2 CUB domains abolished AP-Sema3A binding but had relatively little effect on VEGF165 binding (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, deletion of the b1 CF-V/VIII domain abolished binding to both ligands (Fig. 1, C and D). Deletion of the b2 CF-V/VIII domain did not abolish binding to either ligand (Fig. 1, C and D), although reduced binding of AP-VEGF165 to the b2 deletion variant was consistently observed. These results suggest that each of the CUB domains is essential for Sema3A but not VEGF165binding, and the b1 CF-V/VIII region is required for binding to both ligands. To further refine our characterization of distinct ligand binding sites on Npn-1, candidate Sema3A-binding residues were sought by generating a three-dimensional model of the Npn-1 a1 CUB domain. Using the crystal structure of the bovine spermadhesin CUB domain (32Romero A. Romao M.J. Varela P.F. Kolln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Sanz L. Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and an alignment of the Npn-1 a1 and spermadhesin CUB domain amino acid sequences, we identified four loop regions in the Npn-1 a1 CUB domain that are likely to be solvent-exposed (Fig. 2, labeled red (2I),pink (2AB), light green (2C), and dark green (3D)). Three of these (2AB, 2C, and 3D) reside on one side of the predicted a1 CUB domain, whereas the fourth (2I) lies on the opposite side. Solvent-exposed regions were sought because they are likely to mediate interactions with ligands, and mutations at such sites are less likely to disrupt global structure. Residues of the four regions selected for mutation (2A, 2B, 2C, and 2I) were not only solvent-exposed but"

They are sites of action for a variety of modulatory agents, including volatile anesthetics and neurotransmitters/hormones, the latter acting via mechanisms that have remained elusive. To clarify these mechanisms, we generated mutant channels and found that alterations disrupting anesthetic (halothane) activation of these channels also disrupted transmitter (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH) inhibition and did so to a similar degree. For both TASK-1 and TASK-3, mutations (substitutions with corresponding residues from TREK-1) in a six-residue sequence at the beginning of the cytoplasmic C terminus virtually abolished both anesthetic activation and transmitter inhibition. The only sequence motif identified with a classical signaling mechanism in this region is a potential phosphorylation site; however, mutation of this site failed to disrupt modulation. TASK-1 and TASK-3 differed insofar as a large portion of the C terminus was necessary for the full effects of halothane and TRH on TASK-3 but not on TASK-1. Finally, tandem-linked TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimeric channels were fully modulated by anesthetic and transmitter, and introduction of the identified mutations either into the TASK-1 or the TASK-3 portion of the channel was sufficient to disrupt both effects. Thus, both anesthetic activation and transmitter inhibition of these channels require a region at the interface between the final transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C terminus that has not been associated previously with receptor signal transduction. Our results also indicate a close molecular relationship between these two forms of modulation, one endogenous and the other clinically applied.

Physiol. 2000; 279: F793-F801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their name (an acronym for “TWIK-related acid sensitiveK+ channels”) is derived from their structural similarity to the first mammalian member of the two-pore domain family to be characterized (TWIK-1), and from the fact that the activity of these channels is sensitive to changes in extracellular pH in the physiological range (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Like other two-pore domain family members, these channels show little time or voltage dependence. Thus they have characteristics of leak K+ channels, generating background currents that contribute to membrane potential and the shaping of cell excitability.The first TASK channel to be cloned, TASK-1 (designated KCNK3 by the Human Genome Organization), has been established as a site of modulation by a variety of agents, including hydrogen ions, oxygen, volatile anesthetics, and hormones/neurotransmitters (4Patel A.J.

Progress also has been made in identifying channel regions required for the actions of volatile anesthetics on human TASK-1 (26Patel A.J. Honore E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) (see below). However, the mechanisms underlying effects of neurotransmitters on these channels are poorly understood. For TASK-1 (and recently TASK-3) (24Czirjak G. Enyedi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5426-5432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), inhibition via Gαq/11-coupled receptors has been demonstrated for the cloned channels and for channels with similar properties in native systems (7Czirjak G.

Here, we report the results of experiments in which we used mutagenesis of TASK-1 and its homologue TASK-3 to investigate the molecular bases for neurotransmitter inhibition of these channels in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the TRH-R1 receptor. We found that mutations disrupting anesthetic activation of these channels also disrupt transmitter inhibition; both of these effects require a region of the channel that does not contain motifs suggestive of a traditional signaling pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA encoding rat TASK-1 (GenBankTM accession number AF031384) and rat TASK-3 (GenBankTM accession number AF391084) were obtained from Andrew Gray (University of California, San Francisco) (27Leonoudakis D.

Portions of mouse TREK-1 (29Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number AF056492, obtained from Andrew Gray) were used to make chimeric constructs. Site-specific mutations and chimeras were generated by PCR using the overlap-extension method (31Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). A TASK-1/TASK-3 tandem dimer also was produced using PCR. The resulting channel contains a three-residue (glycine-serine-alanine) linker region, placed after the C-terminal amino acid of TASK-1 and fused to the start methionine of TASK-3. Mutations were introduced into this dimeric construct by ligation of fragments excised from cDNAs coding for the relevant monomeric mutant channels.For both TASK-1 and TASK-3, a hemagglutinin epitope tag was added to the wild-type channel and to a number of different mutant constructs. These included the four TASK/TREK chimeric channels (i.e.TASK-1 and TASK-3 containing either a portion of the TREK-1 C terminus or six residues substituted from TREK-1, see “Results”). The sequence encoding the epitope was excised from pKH3 (32Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (obtained from Ian Macara, University of Virginia). Each construct was modified by PCR to allow for insertion of the epitope upstream of the start methionine, with an intervening three-residue (glycine-serine-alanine) linker. For all six of these epitope-tagged constructs, the responses to halothane and TRH were not different from the responses of constructs without the epitope, and therefore the data were pooled. All subsequent mutations, including the point mutations for TASK-1 and C-terminal deletions for TASK-3, were made in the context of the epitope-tagged channels. Plasmids were prepared by column elution (Endo-Free Plasmid Maxi Kit, Qiagen, Inc.) and further purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. All constructs were fully verified by sequence analysis.HEK 293 cells stably expressing the TRH-R1 receptor (E2 cells (33Kim G.D. Carr I.C. Anderson L.A. Zabavnik J. Eidne K.A. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (pGreenLantern, Invitrogen) at a ratio of 6 μg of channel cDNA to 1 μg of green fluorescent protein. DNA precipitant was washed from cells 1–4 h after transfection, and cells were plated onto polylysine-coated coverslips 4–15 h later. Electrophysiological recordings were performed within 24 h of transfection. Cells were visualized by differential interference contrast optics and by fluorescence using a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Care was taken to select cells for recording that were not coupled to neighboring cells. Bath recording solution consisted of (in mm) 130 NaCl; 3 KCl; 2 MgCl2; 2 CaCl2; 1.25 NaH2PO4; 10 HEPES; and 10 glucose. pH was adjusted using NaOH and HCl. A continuous gravity perfusion system (flow, 5–7 ml/min) was used to change solutions.Patch electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass to resistances of 2–7 megohms and coated with Sylgard 184 (World Precision Instruments). Internal solution contained (in mm): 120 potassium methane sulfonate; 4 NaCl; 1 MgCl2; 0.5 CaCl2; 10 HEPES; 10 EGTA; 3 MgATP; 0.3 GTP-Tris, pH 7.2. Recordings were obtained using an Axopatch 200A amplifier and digitized with a Digidata 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments). Series resistance was compensated by 60–75% and was carefully monitored throughout the recordings to ensure accurate compensation. Voltage commands were applied and currents recorded and analyzed using pCLAMP software (Axon). Cells were held at −60 mV, and depolarizing ramps (0.2 V/s, from −130 to +20 mV) were applied at 5-s intervals.For analysis, slope conductance was evaluated by linear fits to currents from −130 to −60 mV. For each cell, effects of halothane and TRH were normalized to the pH-sensitive conductance (i.e. the conductance at pH 8.4, less the conductance obtained when the channels were fully inhibited, pH 5.9). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses of anesthetic and transmitter effects on wild-type and mutant channels were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using a statistics software package (SigmaStat, Jandel Scientific). Pairwise comparisons were made using the Student-Newman-Keuls method, with p < 0.05 as criteria for acceptance as statistically significant. Linear regression analysis was performed using the same software.TRH (American Peptide) was used at 0.2 μm. Halothane was bubbled into the perfusate via a vaporizer (Ohmeda, Austell, GA) using a room air/gas mixture (21% O2/balance N2). Aqueous concentrations were determined by gas chromatographic analysis of solutions taken from the recording chamber (34Sirois J.E. Pancrazio J.J. Lynch III, C. Bayliss D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 851-862Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe generated mutations in TASK-1 and TASK-3 in order to identify regions critical for neurotransmitter inhibition of these channels, and we found that alterations disrupting anesthetic activation also interfered with neurotransmitter inhibition. For TASK-1, removal of the cytoplasmic C terminus failed to affect either form of regulation, even though this domain contains in its primary sequence a number of motifs associated with receptor signal transduction (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

Also, mutations in the M2-M3 cytoplasmic linker region failed to disrupt modulation. Instead, a region not associated with known signal transduction-related motifs, at the interface between the presumed fourth transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C terminus, was critical for both halothane activation and TRH inhibition of TASK-1 currents. Substitution of six residues from TREK-1 into this region (in the context of full-length TASK-1 or in the replacement of the C terminus with a section from TREK-1) essentially abolished both effects. Mutagenesis of TASK-3 produced similar although not identical results. We used the same strategy (substitution of residues from TREK-1) and found that the corresponding region in TASK-3 was critical for modulation by halothane and TRH. However, a large portion of the C terminus of TASK-3 was necessary for the full effects of these agents.Identification of a Domain in TASK-1 and TASK-3 Critical for Transmitter InhibitionWe identified a region in both TASK-1 and TASK-3 at the cytoplasmic face of the fourth transmembrane domain that is critical for channel inhibition by transmitters. Similar or identical sequence is present in the corresponding regions of presumed channels from Caenorhabditis elegans (GenBankTMaccession number AF083652) and Drosophila melanogaster(GenBankTM accession numbers AAF54970 and AAF54374), indicating that this sequence is ancient and may have the same importance in regulating channel activity in those species as well. Also, it has been noted that an analogous region (immediately following the S6 transmembrane domain) is likely to be important for transmission of intracellular gating signals in voltage- and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (39Flynn G.E. Johnson J.P., Jr. Zagotta W.N. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The importance of this region was unexpected, because the relevant sequence is not identified with any known signal transduction motifs. However, this fact is consistent with previous negative findings regarding second messenger pathways responsible for TASK channel inhibition by neurotransmitters and hormones (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E. Butler M.H. Goldstein S.A. J. Biol.

Inhibition of TASK-1 and TASK-3, or native counterparts, has been demonstrated for a number of different G protein-coupled receptors besides the TRH-R1 receptor, all of which specifically couple to G proteins of the αq/11 family (7Czirjak G. Fischer T. Spat A. Lesage F. Enyedi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 863-874PubMed Google Scholar, 8Millar J.A. Barratt L. Southan A.P. Page K.M. Fyffe R.E. Robertson B. Mathie A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The downstream signaling pathway most commonly associated with activation of these receptors entails hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) by phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in production of inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. However, initial reports (3Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M. Reyes R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5464-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 19Lopes C.M. Gallagher P.G. Buck M.E.

Although most of the evidence has been negative, two proposed signaling mechanisms have received some positive support. One proposal suggests that the mechanism does not involve pathways downstream of PLC but instead results from PLC-mediated depletion of PI(4,5)P2(28Czirjak G. Petheo G.L. Spat A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as has been suggested for receptor-mediated inhibition of members of the inwardly rectifying K+ channel family (41Kobrinsky E. Mirshahi T. Zhang H. Jin T. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 42Hilgemann D.W. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci.

Supporting a role for PLC in receptor-mediated TASK-1 inhibition, the Gαi/o-coupled M2 muscarinic receptor was able to inhibit TASK-1 currents only upon overexpression of PLCβ2, an isoform that can be activated by Gαi/o-coupled receptors. In addition, the PLC inhibitor U73122 reduced receptor effects on TASK-1 in Xenopus oocytes, and the phospholipid kinase inhibitor wortmannin (used at concentrations high enough to block phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases) slowed recovery from receptor inhibition, presumably as a result of a reduced ability of the cells to replenish PI(4,5)P2 levels (28Czirjak G. Petheo G.L. Spat A. Enyedi P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C700-C708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the pharmacological evidence has not been universally positive. In HEK 293 cells, U73122 (but not its inactive analogue U73343) partially blocked TRH inhibition, but another PLC blocker, D609, was ineffective.2 Also, treatment of cerebellar granule neurons with U73122 failed to prevent receptor-mediated inhibition of I(K)SO, a native correlate of TASK channels (44Boyd D.F. Millar J.A. Watkins C.S. Mathie A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 321-331Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In any case, the possibility that PI(4,5)P2 depletion contributes to receptor inhibition of TASK-1 and TASK-3 awaits more experimentation, such as testing for channel activation by the compound itself.A second signaling pathway proposed for receptor actions on TASK-1 involves the endocannabinoid anandamide, which inhibits human TASK-1 currents at sub-micromolar levels, although it is less potent at inhibiting TASK-3 (40Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lazdunski M. Honore E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This compound can be released in neurons by activation of Gαq/11-coupled receptors (45Maejima T. Hashimoto K. Yoshida T. Aiba A. Kano M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), making it an appealing candidate for mediation of receptor inhibition of TASK-1. However, in their examination of the effects of this lipid on human TASK-1, Maingret et al. (40Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lazdunski M. Honore E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) found that substitution of the C terminus of TREK-1 into this channel did not prevent anandamide inhibition. In the present study, we show that a similar substitution did prevent receptor-mediated inhibition of rat TASK-1 and TASK-3. Therefore, these two sets of data dissociate receptor effects from those of anandamide and do not support a role for anandamide in receptor inhibition of TASK channels.Convergence of Anesthetic and Transmitter EffectsOur results suggest an unexpected convergence of effects of anesthetics and neurotransmitters at the molecular level, because the same region of the channel was critical for both anesthetic activation and transmitter inhibition. Moreover, mutations resulting in partial blockade of one effect also produced partial obstruction of the other. These mutations included an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution in TASK-1, and TASK-3 constructs in which increasing portions of the C terminus were removed. The TASK-3 C-terminal deletion mutants were especially interesting in this regard, because halothane and TRH shared the same rank order of potency in their effects on these channels, with increasing lengths of the C terminus resulting in incrementally greater effects for both anesthetic and transmitter. The data clearly indicate that these agents share structural requirements at the channel and may act via a com"

G. W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 21099–21104). However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show that cholesterol depletion increases EGF binding, whereas cholesterol loading lowers EGF binding. Based on binding analyses, we demonstrate that the observed changes in EGF binding are caused by alterations in the number of EGF receptors available for ligand binding, whereas the affinity of the receptor for EGF remains unaltered. We also show by immunofluorescence that in unstimulated cells the EGF receptor is localized in non-caveolar lipid rafts containing the ganglioside GM1 and that patching of these rafts by cholera toxin B-chain causes co-patching of EGF receptors. Experiments with solubilization in different detergents at 4 °C show that the association of the EGF receptor with these rafts is sensitive to Triton X-100 extraction but insensitive to extraction with another non-ionic detergent, Brij 58. Furthermore, experiments with cholesterol-depleted cells show that the association is cholesterol-dependent. We propose that non-caveolar lipid rafts function as negative regulators of EGF receptor signaling by sequestering a fraction of the EGF receptors in a state inaccessible for ligand binding.

We propose that non-caveolar lipid rafts function as negative regulators of EGF receptor signaling by sequestering a fraction of the EGF receptors in a state inaccessible for ligand binding. Cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane domains function as signaling platforms providing the structural environment for interactions between ligands, plasma membrane receptors, and downstream molecules. This is particularly well established for non-caveolar domains, the so-called rafts, but many reports also point to a similar function of caveolae (see Refs. 2Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P.

However, these conclusions are based on studies where caveolae were isolated by subcellular fractionation via density centrifugations. Because the buoyancy of caveolae and non-caveolar lipid rafts is believed to be the same, such fractionation methods may not yield a pure caveolae fraction but rather a fraction containing both caveolae and non-caveolar lipid rafts. Indeed, a study based on immunoisolation of caveolae from such membrane fractions has reported that the unstimulated EGF receptor is localized in low buoyancy non-caveolar membrane domains (5Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although the exact localization of EGF receptors in the plasma membrane is uncertain, it is clear that cholesterol affects the function of the receptor. It has been shown that cholesterol depletion causes EGF-mediated hyperactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and increased DNA synthesis (1Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). epidermal growth factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered saline methyl-β-cyclodextrin 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol cholera toxin B Disruption of caveolae and lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion has been shown to influence the signaling from many plasma membrane receptors other than the EGF receptor, including receptor protein-tyrosine kinases like the insulin receptor, the T-cell antigen receptor, and several G-protein-coupled receptors (1Furuchi T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms whereby cholesterol depletion exerts its effect on receptor signaling are in most cases unknown. In case of the EGF receptor, it has been reported that direct interactions between the EGF receptor and the caveolin scaffolding domain inhibit autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor (12Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that caveolin serves as a negative regulator of EGF receptor mitogenic signaling and that disruption of caveolae by cholesterol depletion leads to loss of caveolin-mediated inhibition of EGF receptor signaling (13Engelman J.A. Chu C. Lin A., Jo, H. Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Kohtz S. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, in light of the remaining uncertainty concerning whether EGF receptors are localized in caveolae, it is unclear whether the effect of cholesterol depletion on EGF receptor signaling can be attributed to disruption of a caveolin-EGF receptor interaction. It is known that in some cases cholesterol can modulate ligand binding to membrane receptors, thereby affecting signal transduction. Studies of some G-protein-coupled receptors, oxytocin receptor, cholecystokinin receptor, and the galanin receptor GalR2 have shown that cholesterol depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) markedly decreases ligand binding to these receptors (8Pang L. Graziano M. Wang S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12003-12011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We show that cholesterol depletion increases ligand binding to the EGF receptor, whereas cholesterol loading decreases ligand binding. The modulation of EGF receptor ligand binding is because of changes in the number of binding sites, Bmax, whereas the affinity of the receptor for EGF, Kd, remains constant. By confocal microscopy we show that the EGF receptor is localized in membrane domains containing the ganglioside GM1. A small fraction of these EGF receptor-containing membrane domains may be caveolae, but the majority are non-caveolar membrane domains. Furthermore, we show that the EGF receptor is associated with Triton X-100-soluble, Brij 58-insoluble membrane domains and that this association is cholesterol-dependent. We therefore propose that non-caveolar rafts are negative regulators of EGF receptor ligand binding. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. HeLa, A431, and HEp2 cells were grown in T25 or T75 flasks (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Napersville, IL) at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all reagents from Invitrogen). For125I-EGF binding experiments, the cells were grown in 12-well Nunclon Multidishes (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Napersville, IL) for 24 h (HeLa and HEp2 cells) or for 48 h (A431 cells) prior to experiments. For immunofluorescence, HeLa cells were grown on 4-chamber Labtek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Corp., Napersville, IL) for 24 h before the experiments. All of the experiments with mβCD, mβCD-cholesterol, and filipin were done using DMEM/HEPES medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.2% BSA. For cholesterol depletion, cells were incubated with medium containing the indicated concentration of mβCD for 30 min at 37 °C. For cholesterol loading, cells were incubated with medium containing the indicated concentration of an mβCD-cholesterol complex for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubations, cells were rinsed 3× with warm medium before further experiments were performed. For treatment with filipin, filipin was dissolved to 20 μg/μl in DMSO, and this stock solution was frozen at −20 °C. For experiments, cells were incubated with this stock diluted in medium to give the concentration of filipin indicated. For energy depletion, cells were incubated with depletion medium (DMEM/HEPES, 50 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 10 mmNaN3) for 30 min at 37 °C. Further incubations with mβCD were performed using depletion medium. For control of energy depletion, cells were energy-depleted as described or left as control and thereafter incubated with tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated EGF or transferrin (both from Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands) in depletion medium or control medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy to confirm that endocytosis was blocked in the energy-depleted cells compared with control cells. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and the lysates were homogenized using a 21-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. Cholesterol was determined spectrophotometrically as reported previously (14Grimmer S. Iversen T.G. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4205-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using the Infinity Cholesterol Assay kit from Sigma. For binding analyses, cells were grown in 12-well Nunclon Multidishes, treated as described or left as control cells, and incubated with 1 nm 125I-EGF (Amersham Biosciences AB) in DMEM/HEPES with 0.2% BSA for 1 h on ice. The incubation medium was removed, and the cells were washed 3× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 1 m NaOH. The hydrolyzed cells were transferred to tubes for γ-counting. For determination of Kd and Bmax values, cells were grown in 12-well Nunclon multidishes, treated as described or left as control cells, and incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-EGF for 4 h on ice in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 200 nm unlabeled EGF (Calbiochem). The incubation medium was removed, and the cells were washed 3× with ice-cold PBS and hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 1 m NaOH. The hydrolyzed cells were transferred to tubes for γ-counting. All binding data were correlated to total amount of cellular protein. The specific binding was calculated as total binding minus nonspecific binding, and the data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting to the equation, bound = (Bmax × concentration)/(Kd + concentration) using Statistica (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK). Nonspecific binding was less than 5% of total binding. Cells were cholesterol-depleted with the indicated concentration of mβCD or left as control cells, rinsed 3× with PBS, and harvested in ice-cold PBS by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and split into 1–3 aliquots. The cells in each aliquot were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% detergent (Triton X-100, Brij 56, or Brij 58) by gentle mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the postnuclear supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the pellet containing insoluble membrane domains was resuspended in buffer A containing 0.5% of the appropriate detergent. Pellets and supernatants of the centrifuged cell lysates were separated on 4–12% Bistris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences AB). The membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk (Bio-Rad) in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20). Primary and secondary antibodies were bound to the membranes in blocking buffer. The antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories and BD PharMingen) diluted 1:3000, mouse monoclonal anti-EGF receptor diluted 1:1000, horseradish peroxidase swine anti-rabbit diluted 1:3000, and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse diluted 1:2000 (both from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Membranes were washed 4 times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 between antibody incubations. Immunosignals were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent exposing Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences AB). For semi-quantitative labeling of surface EGF receptors, cells grown on chamber slides were cholesterol-depleted or cholesterol-loaded as described and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were blocked in blocking buffer (5% goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) in PBS) and the unpermeabilized cells incubated with primary anti-EGF receptor antibodies and secondary fluorescent antibodies to label surface EGF receptors. The average cellular fluorescence intensity in control cells or treated cells, corresponding to the amount of surface EGF receptors, was determined in the confocal microscope by analyzing 8–10 groups of 5–15 cells using a ×20 objective and a fully open pinhole. The average cellular fluorescence was calculated by dividing the total fluorescence minus background fluorescence with the number of cells analyzed in each group and finally averaging the obtained cellular fluorescence values for the 8–10 different groups. For co-localization of the EGF receptor with caveolin-1 and GM1, cells grown on chamber slides were first incubated with a cholera toxin B-chain (CT-B) Alexa 594 conjugate (10 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands) dissolved in DMEM/HEPES, 0.2% BSA, for 1 h on ice to label GM1. Cells were then washed 3× in cold PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min on ice and thereafter 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked and permeabilized in blocking buffer containing 0.2% saponin for 20 min. For antibody binding, cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer containing 0.2% saponin for 1 h, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with secondary fluorescent antibodies for 30 min. Patching of GM1 was performed as follows: cells grown on chamber slides were incubated with CT-B-Alexa 594 for 1 h at 12 °C, washed, incubated with an anti-cholera toxin polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 12 °C, washed, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were thereafter labeled as described above. The antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories and BD PharMingen) diluted 1:400, mouse monoclonal anti-EGF receptor (Amersham Biosciences AB) diluted 1:50, rabbit polyclonal anti-cholera toxin diluted 1:800, goat anti-rabbit Alexa 633 diluted 1:400, and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 diluted 1:400 (both from Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands). The microscope used was a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. The objectives were a plan-neofluor ×20/0.5, a C-apochromat ×40/1.2 W corr, and a Plan apochromat ×100/1.4 oil Iris lens. The 488 nm line from an Ar laser and the 543 and 633 nm lines from two He/Ne lasers were used for excitation. To investigate the effect of cholesterol depletion on EGF receptor ligand binding, HeLa cells were cholesterol-depleted using mβCD. As can be seen from Fig. 1 A, a 30-min extraction with increasing concentrations of mβCD removed increasing amounts of cellular cholesterol, as measured by a spectrophotometric cholesterol assay. The influence of cholesterol on EGF binding was analyzed by incubation of the cells on ice with 1 nm 125I-EGF. Cholesterol depletion of HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of mβCD led to an increase in EGF binding (Fig. 1 B). The same effect was seen on A431 and HEp2 cells (not shown). Cholesterol depletion with mβCD is known to disrupt caveolae (15Hailstones D. Sleer L.S. Parton R.G. Stanley K.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Vilhardt Ø.G.F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Because several studies (1Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 4Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have reported that the EGF receptor is located in caveolae, the effect of cholesterol depletion on EGF binding could be due to disruption of caveolae. Another way to disrupt caveolae is by incubating the cells with the cholesterol-binding drug filipin, which does not remove cholesterol from the membrane but causes it to aggregate via cross-linking (17Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We therefore incubated HeLa cells with 2 or 5 μg/ml filipin for 30 min followed by binding of125I-EGF on ice. No changes in EGF binding were seen following filipin treatment (Fig. 1 C). It thus appears that the disruption of caveolae is not sufficient to cause increased EGF binding but that the increase in EGF binding following cholesterol extraction with mβCD is due to the removal of cholesterol from the plasma membrane. We next investigated whether the effect of cholesterol depletion on EGF binding was due to changes in the affinity of the receptor for the ligand (Kd) or to changes in the total number of binding sites (Bmax). Cells were left untreated or incubated with 5 mm mβCD, and subsequently increasing concentrations of 125I-EGF were bound to the cells on ice for 4 h. Fig. 2 A shows the binding curves obtained (compare middle and upper curves). The best fit values for Kd and Bmax were determined by nonlinear regression. Although the value for Kd remained unchanged,Bmax was increased by cholesterol depletion compared with control cells (Fig. 2 B). This means that cholesterol depletion increases the number of EGF-binding sites on the plasma membrane. Because cholesterol depletion has been shown to inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis (16Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Vilhardt Ø.G.F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), one possible explanation for the increase in Bmax following cholesterol depletion could be an inhibition of a basal rate of endocytosis of EGF receptors. Alternatively, cholesterol depletion could induce exocytosis, thereby recruiting receptors from an intracellular pool. Because both endo- and exocytosis are energy-requiring processes, we therefore investigated the energy requirement of the cholesterol depletion-induced increase in EGF binding. HeLa cells were energy-depleted for 30 min; thereafter cholesterol was depleted with 5 mm mβCD for 30 min in energy depletion medium, and subsequently 125I-EGF was bound on ice. The energy depletion of the cells was confirmed by inhibition of internalization of fluorescent transferrin or fluorescent EGF (not shown). In energy-depleted cells, the effect of cholesterol depletion on ligand binding reflects the effect on receptors already present in the plasma membrane, because both endo- and exocytosis are abolished. As can be seen from Fig. 2 C, energy depletion alone did not alter the binding of 125I-EGF. Following cholesterol depletion of energy-depleted cells, an increase in EGF binding was seen similar to the increase in cholesterol-depleted control cells. This rules out changes in endo- and exocytosis as mechanisms for the cholesterol-regulated changes in EGF-binding sites on the plasma membrane. It thus appears that cholesterol depletion increases the accessibility of EGF receptors in the plasma membrane for ligand binding. Because the above results indicate that cholesterol depletion increases the accessibility of EGF receptors for EGF binding, we hypothesized that cholesterol loading might have the opposite effect, i.e. to decrease the accessibility of EGF receptors for ligand binding. To test this, HeLa cells were loaded with cholesterol by incubation with increasing concentrations of an mβCD-cholesterol complex for 30 min. Fig. 3 A shows that incubation with increasing amounts of mβCD-cholesterol led to an increase in cellular cholesterol. Incubation of cells with 125I-EGF on ice showed that this increase in cellular cholesterol inhibits EGF binding (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether this decrease in EGF binding was also due to a change in Bmax, as is the case for the binding changes following cholesterol depletion, we next performed a ligand binding analysis of cholesterol-loaded cells. Cells were cholesterol-loaded by incubation for 30 min with mβCD-cholesterol, and subsequently Kd and Bmaxvalues for 125I-EGF were determined as described for cholesterol-depleted cells. The binding curves for control and cholesterol-loaded cells are shown in Fig. 2 A (compare lower and middle curves). As can be seen from Fig. 2 B, cholesterol loading decreases Bmax for EGF binding, whereas Kd remains unchanged. The increase in Bmax following cholesterol loading could be due to induction of endocytosis of EGF receptors, thereby lowering the number of receptors on the cell surface. To further control that the observed changes in Bmax values following cholesterol loading or cholesterol depletion were not due to an altered number of EGF receptors on the cell surface, we next measured the amount of surface EGF receptors on control, cholesterol-depleted, and cholesterol-loaded cells. The cells were grown on chamber slides, cholesterol-depleted, cholesterol-loaded, or left as control cells, and fixed. The fixed cells were left unpermeabilized and immunostained with anti-EGF receptor antibodies to label only surface EGF receptors. The average cellular fluorescence, corresponding to the amount of EGF receptors on the cell surface, was then measured by quantitative fluorescence microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As can be seen from Fig. 3 C, no change in the amount of surface EGF receptors was seen following cholesterol depletion or loading. Because cholesterol modulates EGF receptor ligand binding, we next investigated the localization of EGF receptors in the plasma membrane. As mentioned above, the EGF receptor has been reported to localize to caveolae. We therefore looked at the localization of the EGF receptor relative to caveolae by immunofluorescence. Cells were fixed and stained with anti-EGF receptor and anti-caveolin-1 and examined by confocal microscopy. Whereas caveolin-1 showed the characteristic dotted distribution typical of caveolae, EGF receptors were much more evenly distributed throughout the plasma membrane (see Fig. 4, A–C). Although it cannot be excluded that some EGF receptors were present in caveolae, by far the majority of EGF receptors was present outside caveolae, suggesting that the receptor could be associated with non-caveolar rafts. To visualize the location of EGF receptor not present in caveolae, we investigated the localization of EGF receptor relative to different markers of lipid rafts by immunofluorescence. By this technique, no significant co-localization was observed between EGF receptor and Reggie-1/Flotillin-2 or between EGF receptor and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein placental alkaline phosphatase (not shown). Reggie-1/Flotillin-2 is a constituent of non-caveolar micropatches in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (18Lang D.M. Lommel S. Jung M. Ankerhold R. Petrausch B. Laessing U. Wiechers M.F. Plattner H. Stuermer C.A.O. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 502-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Placental alkaline phosphatase is an often used marker of raft domains (19Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). However, the cells we analyzed expressed very little of both Reggie-1/Flotillin-2 and placental alkaline phosphatase, and these raft markers may therefore not be suitable. We therefore investigated the localization of the EGF receptor relative to the ganglioside GM1. At the electron microscopic level, GM1 has been detected both in caveolae and in patches distinct from caveolae, presumably raft structures, with a diameter of 0.1 μm (20Möbius W. Herzog V. Sandhoff K. Schwarzmann G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and experiments with antibody-induced cross-linking have shown that GM1 co-patches with raft markers such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (19Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). As a marker of GM1 we used fluorescent cholera toxin B-chain (CT-B). Fluorescent CT-B was bound to HeLa cells on ice; the cells were fixed and subsequently labeled for EGF receptor and caveolin-1. We found that some GM1 co-localized with caveolin-1 in caveolae, whereas the majority of GM1 was located outside caveolae (not shown). Interestingly, a very strong co-localization was seen between plasma membrane EGF receptors and GM1 (Fig. 4, D–F). Although some of these GM1-containing membrane domains appear to be caveolae, by far the majority of EGF receptors is associated with non-caveolar, GM1-containing membrane domains. To confirm further that the EGF receptor is indeed localized in GM1-containing membrane domains, we labeled GM1 in HeLa cells by incubating the cells at 12 °C with fluorescent CT-B, and we subsequently induced patching by incubation at 12 °C with anti-cholera toxin antibody. The patched cells were fixed and stained with anti-EGF receptor antibody. As can be seen from Fig. 4 H, this treatment clearly induced patching of GM1. Interestingly, the EGF receptor was co-patched with GM1 (Fig. 4,G–I), showing that there is a physical association of GM1 and EGF receptors, which is strong enough to tolerate patching of GM1. Because Triton X-100 insolubility at 4 °C is an established characteristic of many cholesterol-sphingolipid-containing membrane domains, including both caveolae and non-caveolar lipid rafts (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether the EGF receptor is associated with Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains. HeLa cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100, and the lysates were fractionated into supernatants and pellets by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Although caveolin-1 was largely insoluble in Triton X-100, the EGF receptor was completely soluble after centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min (Fig. 5 A, 1st and 2nd lanes). However, complete solubility of a protein in cold Triton X-100 does not exclude that the protein is associated with other Triton X-100-soluble, cholesterol-rich membrane domains or that the interaction of the protein with Triton X-100-insoluble domains is too weak to persist during Triton X-100 extraction. Indeed, this has been shown to be the case for the membrane protein Prominin, which is Triton X-100-soluble but insoluble in other non-ionic detergents, including Brij 58 and Lubrol WX (21Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In case of the T-cell antigen receptor, the receptor has been shown by fluorescence microscopy to be associated with GM1-containing lipid rafts, although this interaction is not preserved during Triton X-100 extraction (6Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the solubility of the EGF receptor in the non-ionic detergents Brij 56 and Brij 58. Brij 58 is a detergent with a higher hydrophilic-lipophilic balance than Triton X-100, whereas Brij 56 resembles Triton X-100 (21Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were lysed at 4 °C in 0.5% Brij 56 or Brij 58, fractionated into supernatant and pellet by centrifugation, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for EGF receptor and caveolin. Interestingly, after lysis with Brij 56, some EGF receptor was found in the pellet (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lanes 3 and 4), and after lysis with Brij 58 a substantial amount of EGF receptor was found in the pellet (Fig. 5 A, top panel, 5th and 6th lanes). When compared with the total amount of protein in the supernatant and in the pellet as determined by Coomassie Blue staining (not shown), the EGF receptor was highly enriched in the Brij 58 pellet. Caveolin-1 was found in the pellet after lysis with both Brij 56 and Brij 58 (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel, 3rd to 6th lanes). Detergent insolubility of a protein may be a result of either localization of the protein to insoluble membrane domains or due to insolubility of the protein itself in the detergent. Therefore, our results showing that the EGF receptor is highly insoluble in Brij 58 do not necessarily mean that the receptor is localized in insoluble membrane domains. However, the Brij 58 insolubility of the EGF receptor together with our immunofluorescence results showing that the EGF receptor co-localizes with the raft marker GM1 strongly support the idea that the receptor is present in GM1-containing, Brij 58-insoluble lipid rafts. If the association of EGF receptor with Brij 58-insoluble membrane domains is cholesterol-dependent, cholesterol depletion of the cells should cause a shift in the localization of the EGF receptor, from the insoluble membrane fractions in the pellet to the supernatant. To investigate the cholesterol dependence of the association of EGF receptor with Brij 58-insoluble membrane domains, cells were cholesterol-depleted with 5 or 10 mm mβCD for 30 min at 37 °C followed by lysis in cold Brij 58, fractionation into pellet and supernatant by centrifugation, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Following cholesterol depletion, a clear shift of the EGF receptor toward the supernatant was seen (Fig. 5, B and C), revealing that the Brij 58-insoluble membrane domain containing the EGF receptor is cholesterol-dependent. We present results showing that the cholesterol level in the plasma membrane regulates EGF receptor ligand binding. Cholesterol depletion increases EGF binding, whereas cholesterol loading decreases EGF binding. The changes in EGF binding are caused by alterations of the number of available EGF-binding sites, Bmax, whereas Kd values remain unchanged. The changes in Bmax values are not due to altered endo- or exocytosis of receptors but are caused by effects on receptors already present in the plasma membrane. We also show that the EGF receptor is localized in non-caveolar, GM1-containing lipid rafts. These rafts are sensitive to extraction with Triton X-100 but not to extraction with Brij 58. Furthermore, the association of EGF receptors with these rafts is cholesterol-dependent. Similarly to the data shown here, it has been demonstrated previously (22Wang X. Rahman Z. Sun P. Meuillet E.J. George D. Bremer E.G., Al- Qamari A. Paller A.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 69-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that cleavage of cellular gangliosides by sialidase increases EGF binding by increasing Bmax, whereas addition of exogenous gangliosides inhibits EGF binding by lowering Bmax. We therefore propose that the effects of cholesterol and gangliosides on EGF binding are caused by alterations of glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich, non-caveolar membrane domains where the EGF receptor resides. The effect of rafts on ligand binding could be due to direct interactions between the receptor transmembrane domain and raft lipids such as cholesterol and/or glycosphingolipids, or it could be due to raft-facilitated protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, it has been shown recently (23Miljan E.A. Meuillet E.J. Mania-Farnell B. George D. Yamamoto H. Simon H.-G. Bremer E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10108-10113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor interacts with glycosphingolipids, in particular with the ganglioside GM3. However, this interaction does not affect EGF binding to a recombinant form of the extracellular domain in vitro. Whether direct interactions with GM3 affect binding of EGF to the full-length EGF receptor remains to be determined. Previous studies (1Furuchi T. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 4Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have shown that in unstimulated cells, the EGF receptor is present in caveolae. These studies are based on density centrifugations of cells fractionated by a detergent-free method. However, although density centrifugations give information about the densities of the membrane domains containing the proteins of interest, they do not give information about whether these proteins are actually present in the same membrane structures or in different structures with the same density. Therefore, the results should be confirmed by other methods such as co-immunoprecipitation studies or morphological studies. We show by immunofluorescence that by far the majority of EGF receptors is present outside caveolae in GM1-containing membrane domains and that aggregation of GM1 by antibody patching causes co-aggregation of EGF receptors. It has been reported previously (5Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that the EGF receptor in A431 cells is completely solubilized by extraction with cold Triton X-100. Similarly, in our hands, the EGF receptor in HeLa cells was also completely solubilized by extraction with cold Triton X-100, whereas caveolin-1 was largely insoluble. However, following extraction with another nonionic detergent, Brij 58, we found the EGF receptor to be highly enriched in the insoluble fraction, indicating that the EGF receptor is associated with Brij 58-insoluble membrane domains. Raft-associated proteins may be differentially sensitive to extraction with different detergents. This may reflect either that the proteins of interest are localized in different raft structures that do not have the same sensibility to detergent extraction (21Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), or that the proteins are localized in the same raft structures but that their interaction with raft lipids or other proteins are differentially sensitive to detergent extraction (6Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). It is therefore uncertain whether the differential behavior of caveolin-1 and the EGF receptor during Triton X-100 extraction is caused by their localization to different membrane domains. However, our immunofluorescence microscopy experiments show that the EGF receptor is largely absent from caveolae. This is in agreement with a study in which it was shown by immunoprecipitation of cells fractionated by a detergent-free method that the EGF receptor was not localized in caveolae but in non-caveolar, low buoyant membrane domains (5Waugh M.G. Lawson D. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Classically, lipid rafts are viewed as signaling platforms in which the protein-protein interactions are facilitated by spatial proximity (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). However, in some cases the special raft environment might serve a role in inhibition of signaling as well. We therefore propose the model depicted in Fig. 6, in which lipid rafts function as negative regulators of EGF receptor signaling by sequestrating EGF receptors in a state relatively inaccessible for ligand binding. We tentatively speculate that the EGF receptor under physiological conditions moves in and out of the rafts in a regulated way, thereby providing a simple way of controlling EGF receptor ligand binding and signaling.

DE XH/D-box proteins can hydrolyze NTP to NDP in a reaction that is stimulated by, or dependent on, a nucleic acid cofactor. Although several DE XH/D family members exhibit RNA helicase activity in vitro, the action of DE XH/D-box NTPases may not be limited to the unwinding of RNA duplexes. Recent studies suggest that they can act as “RNPases” to displace proteins from nucleic acids (3Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M.

Splicing entails two successive transesterification reactions: in step 1, the 5′ splice site is cleaved and the branched lariat-intermediate is formed; in step 2, the 3′ splice site is cleaved and the exons are joined. Mature mRNA is then released, and the spliceosome components are presumed to recycle for the next round of splicing (10Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F.

For example: Prp28, Brr2, Prp5, and Sub2/UAP56 are important for spliceosome assembly; Prp2 promotes step 1 transesterification; Prp16 is required for the second transesterification step; and Prp22 triggers the release of mature mRNA from the spliceosome (9Staley J.P.

The dominant-negative Prp16 and Prp22 phenotypes can be recapitulated in vitro with purified proteins; for example, inactive Prp16 proteins block step 2 transesterification chemistry and dominant-negative Prp22 proteins block release of mature mRNA from the spliceosome in trans (19Schneider, S., Hotz, H. R., and Schwer, B. (February 20, 2002)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M112473200Google Scholar). Thus, the steps arrested by the dominant-negative mutants illuminate the function of the wild-type proteins during pre-mRNA splicing.S. cerevisiae PRP43 and its mammalian homologue mDEAH9 were isolated in PCR-based screens for DEAH-box proteins (22Arenas J.E.

Arenas and Abelson (22Arenas J.E. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11798-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant, prp43-1, and showed that ACT1 pre-mRNA and excised lariat-intron accumulated in prp43-1 cells that were grown at non-permissive temperature. Lariat-introns accumulated during in vitro splicing carried out in extracts prepared from the prp43-1 cells. Native gel analyses of splicing complexes revealed that the lariat-intron, but not mature mRNA, was contained within the so-called spliceosome A complex (22Arenas J.E. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11798-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Prp43 plays a role in spliceosome disassembly after mRNA is released. However, it remains unclear whether Prp43 acts as a catalyst of spliceosome disassembly and whether ATP is required for Prp43 function.Here we have purified recombinant Prp43 and characterized its biochemical activities. We show that Prp43 hydrolyzes ATP in a divalent cation-dependent reaction that is specifically dependent on an RNA cofactor. We identify individual amino acids within conserved NTPase motifs that are crucial for Prp43 function in vivo and for ATPase activity in vitro. Overexpression of non-functional prp43 alleles in a PRP43 wild-type cell elicits a dominant-negative growth phenotype. In vitro, excess T123A mutant protein blocks degradation of lariat-intron, because it does not allow for release of excised intron from the spliceosome. We show that the lariat-intron is not accessible to debranching by Dbr1 and subsequent degradation when it is held in the splicing complex. We propose that T123A interferes with the ATP-dependent function of wild-type Prp43, which is to catalyze release of lariat-intron from the spliceosome.DISCUSSIONWe have presented an analysis of the DE XH-box protein Prp43. Our results demonstrate that: (i) Prp43 is an RNA-dependent ATPase; (ii) ATPase activity is necessary for Prp43 function in vivo; (iii) the N-terminal 90 amino acids and the C-terminal 45 amino acids are not essential in vivo; (iv) the dominant-negative ATPase-defective mutant T123A blocks release of excised lariat-intron from the spliceosome in vitro; and (vi) debranching enzyme can access the branched RNA only after Prp43 acts.Prp43 is closely related in primary structure to the DEAH-box splicing factors Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 (22Arenas J.E. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11798-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The mutational analysis of Prp43 highlights the common structural requirements for ATP hydrolysis, insofar as conserved residues in motifs I, II, and VI that are important for NTP hydrolysis by Prp16 and Prp22, are also important for ATP hydrolysis by Prp43. Structural studies of several DE XH/D-box proteins, including HCV NS3, eIF-4A, and MjDEAD corroborate biochemical data showing that motifs I, II, and VI constitute the active site for NTP hydrolysis (2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 7Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol.

Yeast. 2000; 16: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).The side-chain hydroxyls of motif III (S/TAT) are not important for NTP hydrolysis, however, they play a crucial role for RNA unwinding by the eIF-4A, NPH-II, NS3, and Prp22 proteins (21Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 30Gross C.H. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4729-4736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Heilek G.M. Peterson M.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6264-6266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine replacements in motif III of these DE XH/D-box helicases result in proteins that retain ATPase activity but do not unwind duplex RNA in vitro, indicating that motif III is responsible for coupling the energy from ATP hydrolysis to a conformational step required for RNA unwinding. Prp22 motif III mutants exhibit severe growth defects, and they fail to release mRNA from the spliceosome in vitro (21Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Campodonico E. Schwer B. Genetics. 2002; 160: 407-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, alanine substitutions in motif III of Prp16 result in proteins that are functional in vivo and that promote the second chemical step of splicing in vitro (19Schneider, S., Hotz, H. R., and Schwer, B. (February 20, 2002)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M112473200Google Scholar, 20Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar). The cold-sensitive growth phenotypes of Prp43 mutants S247A and T249A suggest that the side-chain hydroxyls in motif III are important for Prp43 function in vivo, however, the molecular basis for the growth defect remains to be determined. We found that recombinant Prp43 is unable to unwind the 3′-tailed 25-bp duplex RNA used to demonstrate helicase activity of Prp22 (21Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This may indicate that Prp43 requires a different RNA structure to reveal a putative helicase function, that it may require another protein cofactor for unwinding, or that Prp43 couples ATP hydrolysis to an event other than RNA unwinding.The DEAH-box splicing factors Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 act sequentially in the splicing pathway (9Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 associate with the spliceosome at distinct stages and dissociate after they hydrolyze ATP (15Schwer B. Guthrie C. Nature. 1991; 349: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 32Kim S.H. Lin R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6810-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Their functional specificity is determined at least in part by unique interactions with the spliceosome. In the case of Prp16 and Prp22, it was shown that their unique N-terminal segments are involved in spliceosome binding and that the C-terminal region enhanced or stabilized spliceosome association (20Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar, 33Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses established that more than 145 amino acids upstream of motif I were essential for the in vivo functions of Prp16 and Prp22 (20Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar,33Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21184-21191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1216-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The segment N-terminal to motif I is smaller in Prp43, comprising 118 amino acids, of which 90 can be deleted without deleterious effect on cell growth. Thus, Prp43 is fully active in vivo with an N-terminal extension of only 28 residues. Whether the 28-amino acid segment plays a role in Prp43's association with the spliceosome or whether it is simply an integral part of the ATPase domain is not clear. The latter suggestion arises from the finding that DEAH-box ATPases contain several conserved residues, including an Leu-Pro dipeptide 26 residues upstream of motif I (35Jankowsky J. Jankowsky A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 36Vijayraghavan U. Company M. Abelson J.N. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).ATPase activity is crucial for the biological functions of Prp2, Prp16, Prp22, and Prp43. Non-functional mutants of the DEAH-box splicing factors exert dominant-negative phenotypes in vivo and in vitro (18Edwalds-Gilbert G. Kim D.-H. Kim S.-H. Tseng Y.-H., Yu, Y. Lin R.-J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1106-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Schneider, S., Hotz, H. R., and Schwer, B. (February 20, 2002)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M112473200Google Scholar, 20Hotz H.R. Schwer B. Genetics. 1998; 149: 807-814PubMed Google Scholar, 21Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 mutants specifically block pre-mRNA splicing at the ATP-dependent steps that are catalyzed by the respective wild-type proteins (18Edwalds-Gilbert G. Kim D.-H. Kim S.-H. Tseng Y.-H., Yu, Y. Lin R.-J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1106-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Schneider, S., Hotz, H. R., and Schwer, B. (February 20, 2002)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M112473200Google Scholar). An ATPase-defective Prp43 mutant blocks the release of excised lariat-intron from the spliceosome, revealing that intron-release is an ATP-dependent step catalyzed by Prp43. However, these experiments do not address whether Prp43 carries out an additional, possibly ATP-independent, function during splicing. For example, Prp22 catalyzes mRNA release from the spliceosome, but it also plays an ATP-independent role during the second step of splicing. This latter function was revealed in depletion/reconstitution studies and was unaffected by dominant-negative mutants (16Schwer B. Gross C.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).In wild-type cells, the lariat-intron products of pre-mRNA splicing are not detectable, but they accumulate in prp22,dbr1, prp27, and prp43 mutant cells (22Arenas J.E. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11798-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 33Schneider S. Schwer B. J. Biol.

In vitro studies showed that, when the splicing reaction is blocked at the Prp22 or the Prp43-dependent steps, lariat-intron remains associated with the spliceosome and is therefore protected from debranching and degradation (19Schneider, S., Hotz, H. R., and Schwer, B. (February 20, 2002)J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M112473200Google Scholar, 21Schwer B. Meszaros T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22Arenas J.E. Abelson J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11798-11802Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). In contrast, stable lariat-intron is released from the splicing complex in extracts lacking debranching enzyme Dbr1 (Fig. 7). There was evidence of two forms of intron-containing complexes from the mammalian splicing system. Sucrose gradient fractionation of splicing complexes generated in a HeLa cell nuclear extract revealed small (<30 S) and large (50–60 S) lariat-intron-containing RNP complexes (37Bindereif A. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2582-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The latter complex appeared to contain snRNPs, insofar as the lariat-intron could be immunoprecipitated with anti-Sm antibodies. Electrophoretic separation of splicing complexes in native gels showed that excised lariat-intron remained associated with U2, U5, and U6 snRNPs at the end of the splicing reactions in HeLa extracts (38Konarska M.M. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1987; 49: 763-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).The initial steps in spliceosome disassembly, which entail release of the mature mRNA and lariat-intron splicing products, are catalyzed by the DEAH-box ATPases Prp22 and Prp43. The fate of the snRNP complex after release of lariat-intron by Prp43 is not known. It has been suggested that the complex disassembles and that the snRNPs are recycled for the next round of splicing. This view is based on a model for spliceosome assembly in which the U1, U2, and the U4/U6-U5 snRNPs assemble onto the pre-mRNA in a stepwise fashion (10Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). However, the recent description of the penta-snRNP suggests that a large preassembled complex may associate with the pre-mRNA to form the spliceosome (11Stevens S.W. Ryan D.E. Ge H.Y. Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In either case, the snRNP complex at the end of splicing reaction likely requires extensive remodeling, such as annealing of U4/U6 by Prp24 (39Raghunathan P.L. Guthrie C. Science. 1998; 279: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), before it can engage in a new round of splicing. Whether some of these remodeling steps are driven by ATPases remains to be determined. Members of the family of DE XH/D-box proteins are involved in all major RNA transactions, including transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis, and pre-mRNA splicing (1de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Linder P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 192-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). DE XH/D-box proteins can hydrolyze NTP to NDP in a reaction that is stimulated by, or dependent on, a nucleic acid cofactor. Although several DE XH/D family members exhibit RNA helicase activity in vitro, the action of DE XH/D-box NTPases may not be limited to the unwinding of RNA duplexes. Recent studies suggest that they can act as “RNPases” to displace proteins from nucleic acids (3Jankowsky E. Gross C.H. Shuman S. Pyle A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Chen J.Y.F. Stands L. Staley J.P. Jackups R.R., Jr. Latus L.J. Chang T.H. Mol.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DE XH-box proteins are defined by conserved motifs I (G XGKT), II (DE XH), III (S/TAT), and VI (QR XGR XGR), which are important for ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding (7Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Linder P. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Yeast. 2000; 16: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The DE XH/D-box ATPases Prp5, Brr2, Prp28, Sub2/UAP56, Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 are involved in pre-mRNA splicing (9Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Removal of introns from precursor RNAs is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which is formed by the assembly of U1, U2, and U4/U6/U5 snRNPs and non-snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideDTTdithiothreitolORFopen reading frame5-FOA5-fluororotic acid 1The abbreviations used are: snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoproteinIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideDTTdithiothreitolORFopen reading frame5-FOA5-fluororotic acid proteins onto the precursor RNA (10Burge C.B.

Moore R.E. Young M.K. Lee T.D. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 31-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Splicing entails two successive transesterification reactions: in step 1, the 5′ splice site is cleaved and the branched lariat-intermediate is formed; in step 2, the 3′ splice site is cleaved and the exons are joined. Mature mRNA is then released, and the spliceosome components are presumed to recycle for the next round of splicing (10Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). Splice site recognition and positioning of the reactive nucleotides for catalysis requires dynamic remodeling of an intricate network of RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (12Madhani H.D.

In vitro studies have established that ATP is required for many steps in the splicing cycle and that DE XH/D-box proteins act at those ATP-dependent steps (9Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 10Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 525-560Google Scholar). For example: Prp28, Brr2, Prp5, and Sub2/UAP56 are important for spliceosome assembly; Prp2 promotes step 1 transesterification; Prp16 is required for the second transesterification step; and Prp22 triggers the release of mature mRNA from the spliceosome (9Staley J.P.

Prp2, Prp16, and Prp22 mutants that are defective for ATP hydrolysis are also defective in executing their ATP-dependent functions in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro (16Schwer B. Gross C.H.

At low frequencies and at sufficient vibrational amplitudes, a sharp boundary forms between a lower region of glass and an upper region of the heavier bronze. The boundary undergoes various oscillations, including periodic tilting motion, but remains extremely sharp. At higher frequencies, the bronze separates as a mid-height layer between upper and lower glass regions, and the oscillations are largely absent. The mechanism responsible for the separation can be traced to the effect of air on the granular motion."

It is well known that the Rac activity is regulated via activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. Here we show that increased serine phosphorylation on RET receptor tyrosine kinase following cAMP elevation promotes lamellipodia formation of neuronal cells induced by glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). We identified serine 696 in RET as a putative phosphorylation site by protein kinase A and found that mutation of this serine almost completely inhibited lamellipodia formation by GDNF without affecting activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Mutation of tyrosine 1062 in RET, whose phosphorylation is crucial for activation of PI3K, also inhibited lamellipodia formation by GDNF. Inhibition of lamellipodia formation by mutation of either serine 696 or tyrosine 1062 was associated with decrease of the Rac1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, suggesting that this activity is regulated by two different signaling pathways via serine 696 and tyrosine 1062 in RET. Moreover, in the presence of serine 696 mutation, lamellipodia formation was rescued by replacing tyrosine 687 with phenylalanine.

In particular, phosphorylation of tyrosine 1062 is crucial for activation of major intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK5 pathways (15Kurokawa K.

RET can also activate Rho family GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 that are involved in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton responsible for cell motility and morphology (22van Weering D.H.

It is well known that Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 induce stress fiber, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively, as a result of actin rearrangements (26Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Neurite outgrowth and growth cone response to neurotrophic factors appear to be affected by the activation levels of these small G-proteins (27Mueller B.K. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 351-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 29Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that cAMP functions as a key regulator for neuronal survival, regeneration, and growth cone remodeling mediated by neurotrophic factors (30Engele J. Franke B. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Hanson M.G., Jr. Shen S. Wiemelt A.P. McMorris F.A. Barres B.A. J.

The increase of intracellular cAMP level results in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) that affects a variety of biochemical and biological events in neuronal cells. In this study, we ask if cAMP elevation can modulate RET function and cytoskeletal rearrangement in neuronal cells induced by GDNF. Our experiments revealed that increased phosphorylation of serine 696 in RET by forskolin treatment promotes lamellipodia formation induced by GDNF and that mutation of this serine almost abolished its formation. Because mutation of tyrosine 1062 in RET that impairs the PI3K signaling also inhibited lamellipodia formation, these findings suggested that two different signaling pathways via serine 696 and tyrosine 1062 are involved in lamellipodia formation by GDNF, resulting from Rac1 activation. This represents the first demonstration that cytoskeletal rearrangement by activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase is regulated by its serine phosphorylation probably via cAMP-dependent mechanism. A synthetic phosphopeptide (amino acids 691–701 in RET), including phosphoserine 696, was prepared. Rabbits were immunized with 500 μg of the peptide using the RIBI adjuvant system (RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc.), and phosphorylation state-specific antibody was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Anti-RET and anti-phospho-RET (tyrosine 1062)-specific polyclonal antibodies were developed as described previously (34Qiao S. Iwashita T. Furukawa T. Yamamoto M. Sobue G. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9460-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-AKT polyclonal antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs. Anti-PKA-RII and anti-AKAP79 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human RET cDNA was inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Zeo plasmid vector (Invitrogen). Point mutations were generated by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using a Mammalian Transfection kit (Stratagene). To obtain stable transfectants, colonies were selected in the presence of zeocin (150 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Culture cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue, 80 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)). After boiling for 3 min, equal protein amounts of the lysates were subjected to SDS-8% PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 3% albumin in TPBS (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20) with gentle shaking and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing the membranes three times with TPBS, they were incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (swine anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was examined by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the directions of the supplier. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and the protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The lysate was preincubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma Chemical Co.) and then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove the beads. The supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and mixed with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C. After washing three times in lysis buffer and twice in high salt buffer, the sample was suspended in SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Then the protein A-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the proteins were separated by SDS-8% PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were analyzed by Western blotting. A portion of RET juxtamembrane region containing amino acids 662–723 was cloned into pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. In vitro phosphorylation of the fusion protein by PKA (10 units, catalytic subunit, Promega) was carried out in 25 μl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 460 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. Products were boiled and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cells were grown overnight and serum-starved for 6 h. Then they were incubated with GDNF with or without forskolin or KT5720 pretreatment, fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After incubation in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, the cells were reacted with anti-hemagglutinin A (HA) monoclonal antibody or anti-RET antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine-5-isocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG antibody and FITC-phalloidin. The staining was analyzed by a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). Rac activation was evaluated using the GST-CRIB pull-down assay (35Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were stimulated with GDNF and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmPMSF). The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with GST-CRIB (Upstate Biochemicals). Protein complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. Cells were stimulated with GDNF for 1 min and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). The cleared cell lysates were assayed for GEF activity. GST-Rac1 (1 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 460 kBq of [α-32P]GTP (AmershamBiosciences, Inc.)) in 30 μl of loading buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm DTT) for 30 min at 30 °C. MgCl2 was then added (25 mm at a final concentration) to stabilize [α-32P]GTP bound to GST-Rac1. Cell lysates (500 μg/300 μl) were added to the resulting32P-labeled GST-Rac1 in the presence of 2 mmcold GTP and 10 mm MgCl2 at room temperature. Samples (30 μl) were removed at the indicated time and diluted with ice-cold termination buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT). After precipitation and washing, radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting. After GDNF stimulation for 5 min, cell lysates were prepared as described in Rac1-GEF assay. Recombinant GST-Rac1 was preincubated with 460 kBq of [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GAP reaction and quantification of radioactivity bound to the recombinant protein were assayed as described above. First, to see the effect of increase of intracellular cAMP concentration on the function of RET receptor tyrosine kinase, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells expressing RET and GDNF family receptor α1 (GFRα1) were treated with GDNF and forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. After serum starvation for 6 h, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of forskolin, followed by treatment with GDNF for 5 min. As shown in Fig. 1 A, forskolin treatment gradually decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of RET in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Pretreatment with dibutyryl(db)-cAMP (10 μm), a permeable cAMP analog, also resulted in a decrease of RET tyrosine phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells whereas treatment with KT5720 (1 μm), an inhibitor of PKA, did not show a significant effect on its phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Despite the decrease of RET tyrosine phosphorylation, the activation of ERK and AKT was not significantly affected by treatment with forskolin or db-cAMP (Fig. 1 B). We next examined morphological change of SH-SY5Y cells by GDNF. Lamellipodia formation was observed in ∼10 and 50% of the cells at 5 and 30 min after GDNF stimulation, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). When the cells were pretreated with forskolin or db-cAMP, lamellipodia formation markedly increased (up to ∼30% of the cells) at 5 min after GDNF stimulation. In contrast, pretreatment with KT5720 almost inhibited lamellipodia formation by GDNF (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that cAMP-dependent PKA activity plays a role in actin rearrangements. To confirm these observations, similar experiments were performed by using SK-N-MC human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells transfected with human RET gene (designated MC(RET) cells). Although SK-N-MC cells endogenously express GFRα1 but not RET, lamellipodia formation was not induced by GDNF in them. When MC(RET) cells were used, its formation by GDNF was accelerated by forskolin and impaired by KT5720 as observed for SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2 B). These results showed that lamellipodia formation was regulated by both RET and cAMP-dependent mechanisms. Because RET contains a consensus phosphorylation motif (R X1–3(S/T)) for PKA in the juxtamembrane region, including serine 696 (Fig. 3 A), a possibility was that acceleration of lamellipodia formation by forskolin and db-cAMP was mediated by direct phosphorylation of this serine by PKA. To investigate whether serine 696 represents a phosphorylation site for PKA, we carried out an in vitro phosphorylation assay, using a GST-fused peptide containing amino acids 662–723 of RET. The assay showed that this peptide is phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 3 B). When serine 696 was replaced with alanine, no phosphorylation of the mutant peptide was observed (Fig. 3 B). To elucidate that serine 696 is phosphorylated in vivo, we transfected RET cDNA with the S696A mutation into SK-N-MC cells and established the cell lines expressing the mutant protein (designated S696A cells). Simultaneously, we developed a polyclonal antibody that recognizes phosphorylated serine 696 in RET (designated anti-RET(pS696) antibody). When the SH-SY5Y cells were treated with forskolin or db-cAMP, the levels of RET phosphorylation recognized by this antibody significantly increased (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, a phosphorylated band was detected neither in the lysate from KT5720-treated SH-SY5Y cells nor in the lysate from forskolin-treated S696A cells (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that serine 696 represents a putative phosphorylation site by PKA in vivo. We further investigated whether RET is associated with PKA and/or PKA-anchoring protein, AKAP79, which is known to link to the plasma membrane (36Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The cell lysates from MC(RET) and S696A cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-RET antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PKA or anti-AKAP79 antibody. Interestingly, both PKA and AKAP79 were coimmunoprecipitated with RET from the lysates of GDNF-untreated or treated MC(RET) and S696A cells to similar degree (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that the association of RET with AKAP79 and PKA is present in a GDNF-independent manner and is not affected by the S696A mutation. In addition, forskolin treatment did not appear to significantly affect this association (Fig. 3 D). When untransfected SK-N-MC cells were used as a negative control for immunoprecipitation, the coprecipitated bands corresponding to AKAP79 and PKA were not observed (data not shown). These results thus suggested the possibility that PKA could be positioned in close proximity to RET through binding to AKAP79. Surprisingly, lamellipodia formation was hardly induced by GDNF in the S696A cells (Fig. 4, A and B). We confirm this phenomenon using three independent transfectants expressing RET with the S696A mutation. Unlike in MC(RET) cells, the level of RET tyrosine phosphorylation did not significantly changed in S696A cells after forskolin treatment (Fig. 4 C). Because it is well known that the representative intracellular signaling pathways, including the RAS/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, are activated mainly through tyrosine 1062 present in the carboxyl-terminal tail of RET (Fig. 3 A) (18Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi H. Ichihara M. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Shimono Y. Kawai K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3568-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), phosphorylation levels of tyrosine 1062 were compared between MC(RET) cells and S696A cells. Western blot analysis with the antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine 1062 (anti-RET(pY1062)) (34Qiao S. Iwashita T. Furukawa T. Yamamoto M. Sobue G. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9460-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that its levels were comparable in both cells stimulated with GDNF (Fig. 4 C). In addition, the ERK and AKT activation (Fig. 4 C) as well as PI3K activation (data not shown) by GDNF were not impaired in S696A cells, indicating that the S696A mutation inhibited lamellipodia formation without affecting the activation of major signaling pathways through phosphorylated tyrosine 1062. Because it was previously reported that activation of PI3K is required for RET-mediated lamellipodia formation (22van Weering D.H. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we investigated lamellipodia formation of the SK-N-MC cells expressing RET in which tyrosine 1062 was replaced with phenylalanine (designated Y1062F cells). As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), no lamellipodia formation was observed in Y1062F cells. Activation of PI3K, ERK, and AKT by GDNF was markedly impaired in Y1062F cells (Fig. 4 C and data not shown) as previously described (18Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi H. Ichihara M. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Murakumo Y. Imai T. Funahashi H. Nakao A. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4469-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that two different signaling pathways via serine 696 and tyrosine 1062 in RET are required for lamellipodia formation induced by GDNF. We further investigated whether Rac1 activation by GDNF was altered by the S696A or Y1062F mutation. Using the GST-CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interacting binding) pull-down assay, the amount of activated form of Rac1 (GTP-bound Rac1) was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. In the MC(RET) cells, stimulation with GDNF resulted in a rapid increase of GTP-Rac1 that showed a maximal level at 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, a significant Rac1 activation was not observed in S696A and Y1062F cells stimulated with GDNF (Fig. 5 A), indicating that Rac1 activation was impaired by these mutations. To confirm the importance of Rac1 activity for lamellipodia formation, we transiently transfected dominant-active Rac1 tagged with hemagglutinin A (HA) into MC(RET), S696A (Fig. 5 B), or Y1062F (data not shown) cells, followed by staining with FITC-phalloidin and anti-HA antibody. Expression of dominant-active Rac1 induced lamellipodia formation in these transfectants without GDNF stimulation (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, when HA-tagged dominant-negative Rac1 was transiently transfected, lamellipodia formation was inhibited in the transfectants treated with GDNF (Fig. 5 B). These observations demonstrated that Rac1 activity is essential for lamellipodia formation induced by GDNF and that the S696A and Y1062F mutations strongly impaired its activity. The functions of small G-proteins in response to extracellular signals are regulated by activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) or GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). Thus, we investigated whether impairment of Rac1 activity in S696A and Y1062F cells resulted from alteration of Rac1-GEF or Rac1-GAP activity. GST-Rac1 preincubated with [α-32P]GTP was added to the lysates from MC(RET), S696A, and Y1062F cells in the presence of cold GTP, and GEF activity was determined by measuring the amount of 32P retained on GST-Rac1. After GDNF stimulation, a significant increase in Rac1-GEF activity was observed in the lysate from MC(RET) cells but not in the lysate from the S696A and Y1062F cells (Fig. 5 C). On the other hand, when GST-Rac1 preincubated with [γ-32P]GTP was subjected to Rac1-GAP assay, there was no significant difference in Rac1-GAP activity among MC(RET), S696A, and Y1062F cells treated with GDNF (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that impairment of Rac1 activity by S696A or Y1062F mutation is mainly due to the decrease of Rac1-GEF activity. In addition, we found that the Rac1-GEF activity was strongly impaired in the KT5720-treated MC(RET) cells stimulated with GDNF (data not shown). The finding that forskolin and db-cAMP treatment decreased RET tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B) suggested that a few tyrosine residues in RET may be dephosphorylated as a result of serine 696 phosphorylation responsible for acceleration of lamellipodia formation. Because tyrosine 687 is present near serine 696 and was reported to be autophosphorylated in activated RET (37Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we replaced this tyrosine with phenylalanine (Y687F) to see the importance of its phosphorylation to actin rearrangement. The Y687F mutation was introduced into RET cDNA with or without the S696A mutation, and the resulting mutant cDNAs were transiently transfected into SK-N-MC cells and stimulated with GDNF. Interestingly, lamellipodia formation was induced in ∼30% of the S696A/Y687F mutant cells as well as the Y687F cells in repeated experiments (Fig. 6). This suggested the possibility that a signal that negatively regulates the Rac1 activity could be transduced through tyrosine 687 (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7A model for lamellipodia formation mediated by GDNF/RET signaling.

B, modulation of Rac-GEF activity by S696A and Y687F mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study demonstrated that phosphorylation at serine 696 in RET is required for activation of Rac1-GEF as well as lamellipodia formation by GDNF. We identified serine 696 as a putative phosphorylation site by PKA, although it is possible that this phosphorylation is also induced by other kinases in a cAMP-dependent fashion (Fig. 7 A). Increased levels of serine 696 phosphorylation by forskolin and db-cAMP accelerated lamellipodia formation by GDNF whereas inhibition of this phosphorylation by KT5720 almost abolished it. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that lamellipodia formation induced by activation of receptor tyrosine kinase is regulated by its serine phosphorylation probably via a cAMP-dependent mechanism. It could be possible that other members of receptor tyrosine kinases also contain cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites that play important roles in their biological activities. In addition, the results may suggest cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases and other receptors such as G-protein-coupled receptors that are known to activate PKA in neuronal cells (Fig. 7 A) (38Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 39Chern Y. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although GDNF stimulation itself was reported to elevate intracellular cAMP levels to some degree (32Cai D. Shen Y., De Bellard M. Tang S. Filbin M.T. Neuron. 1999; 22: 89-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the level of serine 696 phosphorylation in RET did not significantly increase in GDNF-treated SH-SY5Y cells as compared with untreated cells (data not shown), suggesting the importance of a basal cAMP-dependent kinase activity for lamellipodia formation. We also demonstrated that RET is associated with AKAP79 that is known to be a PKA-anchoring protein (40Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It was reported that the carboxyl-terminal region of AKAP79 contains a high affinity binding site for the type II regulatory subunit (RII) of PKA and that AKAP79 and RII are coenriched and colocalized in neurons that utilize the PKA signaling pathway (36Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 41Glantz S.B. Amat J.A. Rubin C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1215-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because AKAP79 appears to be associated with the plasma membrane through lipid·protein interactions (36Dell'Acqua M.L. Faux M.C. Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2246-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), PKA could be also positioned in close proximity to the plasma membrane through the AKAP79·PKA complex formation, facilitating its access to the juxtamembrane region of RET. Although it remains unknown whether the association of AKAP79·PKA complex with RET is direct or indirect, this finding suggested that the membrane targeting of PKA through this complex formation in the cells may be a crucial step for RET phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A). It has been well established that activation of PI3K by receptor tyrosine kinases is important for Rac activity, leading to lamellipodia formation (42Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of RET, PI3K is activated mainly via phosphorylated tyrosine 1062 that is a binding site for Shc adaptor proteins (15Kurokawa K. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Kawai K. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3568-7356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Shc bound to tyrosine 1062 further mediates the complex formation of Gab1/2 and p85 subunit of PI3K, resulting in the activation of PI3K (18Besset V. Scott R.P. Ibáñez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39159-39166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 19Hayashi H. Ichihara M. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Murakumo Y. Imai T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, our current results showed that the Y1062F mutation almost completely inhibited the Rac1-GEF activity and lamellipodia formation induced by GDNF. In addition, van Weering and Bos (22van Weering D.H. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) reported that RET-mediated lamellipodia formation in SK-N-MC cells was inhibited by treatment with PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, confirming a crucial role of PI3K in its formation (Fig. 7 A). Thus, the Rac1-GEF activity could be regulated by PI3K activation via the Shc-Gab1/2 association on tyrosine 1062. Although it is possible that other cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites are present in the RET intracellular domain, our results revealed that phosphorylation of serine 696 plays a crucial role in lamellipodia formation by GDNF. A proposed model for regulation of lamellipodia formation mediated by serine 696 phosphorylation is shown in Fig. 7. As judged from the results of the experiments using S696A and S696A/Y687F mutant cells, phosphorylation of serine 696 and tyrosine 687 appeared to induce opposite effects on lamellipodia formation (Fig. 7, A and B). Increased levels of serine 696 phosphorylation by forskolin and db-cAMP treatment clearly accelerated lamellipodia formation in neuronal cells, accompanying the decrease of RET tyrosine phosphorylation. On the other hand, the S696A mutation impaired the Rac1-GEF activity and lamellipodia formation without affecting phosphorylation of tyrosine 1062 and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. More interestingly, lamellipodia formation by GDNF was recovered in S696A/Y687F double mutant cells (Fig. 7 B). Although tyrosine 687 in RET was previously identified as an autophosphorylation site by phosphopeptide mapping (37Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), its role in the signal transduction has not been elucidated so far. We speculate that phosphorylation of serine 696 may induce a conformational change of the juxtamembrane region of RET and inhibit phosphorylation of tyrosine 687 that is suggested to negatively regulate the Rac1-GEF activity (Fig. 7 A). The change of conformation or electric charge in the juxtamembrane region induced by phosphorylation of either serine 696 or tyrosine 687 may be involved in the regulation of the Rac1-GEF activity responsible for lamellipodia formation. Taken together, our results strongly supported the view that the Rac1-GEF activity is regulated by two different signaling pathways via serine 696/tyrosine 687 and tyrosine 1062 in RET (Fig. 7). To further elucidate the role of tyrosine 687 phosphorylation in lamellipodia formation, it will be necessary to investigate the change of its phosphorylation levels by forskolin treatment or by the S696A mutation. We are currently trying to develop the antibody that can specifically recognize the phosphorylated tyrosine 687. It is possible that an unknown effector-signaling molecule that functions as a regulator for Rac1-GEF may bind to the juxtamembrane region in RET, particularly to phosphorylated or unphosphorylated tyrosine 687. In this respect, it is interesting to note the cloning of ephexin that is a novel member of the Dbl family of GEFs for Rho GTPases (44Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M., Hu, L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Ephexin interacts directly with EphA receptor tyrosine kinase without the stimulation of its ligand, ephrin-A, and activates RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1. Activation of EphA receptors by ephrin-A regulates the activity of ephexin, resulting in RhoA activation, and Cdc42 and Rac1 inhibition in the growth cone. Thus, it is interesting to speculate that RET phosphorylation via a cAMP-dependent mechanism also regulates the function of a GEF that modulates a balance between RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 activities in neuronal cells. It has been demonstrated that cAMP-dependent pathways modulate neuronal survival, regeneration, and growth cone remodeling mediated by neurotrophic factors (30Engele J. Franke B. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Hanson M.G., Jr. Shen S. Wiemelt A.P. McMorris F.A. Barres B.A. J.

In addition, it is well known that the Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are involved in the regulation of growth cone morphology (29Dickson B.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our results showed that cAMP-dependent signaling transmits to Rac through serine phosphorylation of RET tyrosine kinase in neuronal cells, suggesting the possibility that both RET and cAMP play a cooperative role in growth cone remodeling. Further studies on cAMP-dependent GDNF/RET signaling responsible for cytoskeletal rearrangement may provide a new insight into morphogenesis of the nervous system. We thank K. Kaibuchi and M.

They were quite similar not only to each other but also to the structure of the native pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-form enzyme; root mean square deviations at Cα among the three structures were less than 0.28 Å. The side chains of the amino acid residues around the PLP-l-Ala and PLP-d-Ala were virtually superimposable on each other as well as on those around PLP of the native holoenzyme. The α-hydrogen of the alanine moiety of PLP-l-Ala was located near the OH of Tyr265′, whereas that of PLP-d-Ala was near the NZ of Lys39. These support the previous findings that Tyr265′ and Lys39 are the catalytic bases removing α-hydrogen from l- and d-alanine, respectively. The prerequisite for this two-base mechanism is that the α-proton abstracted from the substrate is transferred (directly or indirectly) between the NZ of Lys39 and the OH of Tyr265′; otherwise the enzyme reaction stops after a single turnover. Only the carboxylate oxygen atom of either PLP-Ala enantiomer occurred at a reasonable position that can mediate the proton transfer; neither the amino acid side chains nor the water molecules were located in the vicinity.

Through site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we have shown that Tyr265′ serves as the base acting on thel-enantiomer (5Watanabe A. Yoshimura T. Mikami B. Esaki N. J. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4189-4194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).According to generally accepted mechanism as well as on the basis of these studies, alanine racemase reaction is proposed to proceed as shown in Scheme FSI: (i) transaldimination between Lys39bound with PLP (I) and the α-amino group of alanine to produce an external aldimine II; (ii) abstraction of the α-hydrogen from alanine to produce a resonance-stabilized quinonoid intermediate III; (iii) reprotonation at the α-carbon of the quinonoid intermediate III on the side opposite to that where the α-hydrogen was abstracted; and (iv) the second transaldimination between IV and Lys39 to release product enantiomer of alanine.However, the following questions have arisen. First, crystallographic studies have revealed that the N1 atom of the PLP pyridine ring is bound with a basic amino acid (Arg219) contrary to aminotransferases, which use an acidic amino acid (aspartate or glutamate) at the corresponding position (7Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Arg219probably makes the pyridine nitrogen less protonated, in contrast to the acidic amino acid residues of aminotransferases. Therefore, Arg219 destabilizes the quinonoid intermediate, which has been considered to be produced as an indispensable intermediate, as described above (Scheme FSI). Second, the two-base mechanism, in which Tyr265′ and Lys39 participate as catalytic bases, requires that Tyr265′ be unprotonated and Lys39 be protonated in the reaction withl-alanine, and vice versa in the reaction withd-alanine. Therefore, another basic residue (B in Scheme FSI) is assumed to participate in the reaction to return the ionization states of Lys39 and Tyr265′ to the original ones in each catalytic turnover. Otherwise the reaction stops after a single turnover. However, no systems catalyzing such synchronized protonation and deprotonation of Lys39 and Tyr265′ through B have yet been shown.We have carried out crystallographic studies of alanine racemase bound with N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)-l-alanine (PLP-l-Ala) and N-(5′-phosphopyridoxyl)-d-alanine (PLP-d-Ala), which are analogs mimicking external aldimine, with the expectation that the structures would give us a clue to solve the above problems. We have obtained interesting results suggesting that the substrate carboxyl group is involved directly in the catalysis by mediating the proton transfer between Lys39 and Tyr265′. Moreover, we have shown by molecular orbital calculation that the racemization reaction probably proceeds without formation of the quinonoid intermediate contrary to the general belief.

This ARE is targeted by conserved signaling pathways, which regulate the localization, stability, and translation of these mRNAs (2Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem.

These findings suggest that TTP limits expression of TNFα and other cytokines through a feedback mechanism, by destabilizing their mRNAs, and that this is a shared function of TTP/TIS11 proteins. Some other CCCH zinc finger proteins appear to regulate translation of their target genes (18Guedes S. Priess J. Development. 1997; 124: 731-739PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tabara H. Hill R.J. Mello C.C.

TTP expression is induced rapidly and directly in numerous cultured cell types, by a wide variety of growth factors and mitogens (22Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

Like some other immediate early proteins, in certain contexts TTP is also expressed during induction of apoptosis (27Haas C.A. Donath C. Kreutzberg G.W.

Consistent with the model that TTP/TIS11 proteins influence growth, survival, or apoptotic signals, we have determined that their constitutive expression at modest levels induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have also shown that TTP has diverged functionally from the other two TTP/TIS11 proteins, in that TTP alone dramatically sensitizes cells to the apoptotic stimulus of TNFα (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,32Johnson, B. A., and Blackwell, T. K. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). This last finding suggests that TTP could contribute to the cellular decision between activation or apoptosis in response to TNFα. Although the isolated TTP zinc finger region can mediate its effects on TNFα mRNA stability in transfection assays (16Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we have observed that the TTP zinc finger region is incapable of inducing apoptosis or of sensitizing cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis (32Johnson, B. A., and Blackwell, T. K. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). Together with the zinc fingers, the TTP N- and C-terminal regions each contribute to induction of apoptosis, and the N-terminal region is specifically required to sensitize cells to TNFα (32Johnson, B. A., and Blackwell, T. K. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, although the isolated TTP zinc finger region is localized predominantly to the nucleus, both the N- and C-terminal regions of TTP promote its localization to the cytoplasm (32Johnson, B. A., and Blackwell, T. K. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar). The importance of the TTP N- and C-terminal regions for these TTP activities makes it critical to identify proteins with which these TTP regions interact functionally. In this study, we have determined that 14-3-3 proteins bind to the TTP C-terminal region sequence-specifically and in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction appears to be conserved among all three TTP/TIS11 proteins. Mutagenesis analysis has identified a specific site in the TTP C terminus that is important for 14-3-3 binding. Binding to 14-3-3 through this site does not appear to be required for the apoptotic effects of TTP but is critical for one of at least three mechanisms that localize TTP to the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that interactions with 14-3-3 are involved in phosphorylation-mediated signals that may regulate TTP functions in vivo. TTP and site-directed TTP mutants were introduced into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector CS2+ (33Turner R. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 243: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) by PCR (Pfu, Stratagene), with a Kozak consensus and ATG added where appropriate. For two-hybrid analysis, TTP, and mutants indicated in Fig. 3 A were cloned by PCR using Pfu (Stratagene) into pC98, a pC97 derivative (34Vidal M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 109-147Google Scholar). To remove its 5′-untranslated region, the 14-3-3η prey coding sequence was re-cloned by PCR. TTP and TTP deletion mutants each were fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) at their N terminus by restriction cloning into C2eGFP (CLONTECH). Analogous GFP fusions of TIS11b and TIS11d were made by PCR cloning in C1eGFP and C2eGFP, respectively. Transfections were carried out as described (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and 35-mm plates unless otherwise stated. DNA amounts were supplemented to 2 μg by addition of pBluescript. LipofectAMINE Plus and 1 μg of total DNA were used when higher efficiencies were desired. DNA amounts used for 10-cm plates for these two transfection methods were 10 and 5 μg, respectively. FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 8 μg of total DNA were used to transfect 10-cm plates for Fig. 3 C. Cell death was assayed by co-transfection of a β-galactosidase reporter and examination of cell morphology after X-gal staining 24 h later (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Under a variety of conditions, numbers of apoptotic cells identified by this method were reproducibly comparable to those detected by scoring Hoechst-stained pyknotic nuclei (not shown) (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For serum-dependent relocalization assays, cells were washed twice in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) prior to transfection, and DMEM without serum was added 3 h later. 26–28 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 20% serum for the times stated before fixation and antibody staining. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 (or Nonidet P-40), 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Pharmaceuticals), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm NaF (cell lysis buffer). Electrophoresis was performed on a minigel apparatus unless otherwise indicated. For Western blotting, 100 μg of protein was generally used per lane, unless otherwise stated. The following commercial monoclonal antibodies were used: Mouse anti-GFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-14-3-3 (H-8, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-HA (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A polyclonal GFP antiserum was purchased from CLONTECH. The TTP peptide antibodies nTTP and cTTP (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Johnson, B. A., and Blackwell, T. K. (2002)Oncogene, in pressGoogle Scholar) were typically used at 1/5000 dilution. Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondaries (Jackson). 200–300 cells per slide were typically counted to determine TTP localization. Yeast two-hybrid screening and interaction assays were performed as described previously (34Vidal M. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 109-147Google Scholar). For analysis of binding in vitro to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-14-3-3 fusion proteins, each 10 cm plate of cells was lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer. 100 μg of protein was saved as an input control. 0.5–1 mg of lysate protein was incubated with 50 μl of a 1:1 bead slurry of GST-14-3-3 isoforms that had been synthesized as described (35Yaffe M.B.

Beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, then boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10 min before electrophoresis and Western blotting. Incubations with calf intestinal phosphatase were performed at 1 unit/10 μg of total protein in lysis buffer (without phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 min at 30 °C. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer, with 3 μl of cleared lysate saved as input. After addition of either 2 μg of rabbit HA antibody (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μl of cTTP, the remaining cleared lysate was rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were spun for 5 min to remove precipitates, then incubated for 1 h with 20 μl of protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that had been preincubated in bovine serum albumin. For monoclonal anti-HA immunoprecipitations, 10 μl of antibody-conjugated beads (F-7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added directly to the lysate for 2 h. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS loading buffer for 10 min before electrophoresis and Western blotting. To identify proteins that interact with TTP, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse mixed-stage embryonic cDNA library using a full-length TTP bait. After isolating a full-length 14-3-3η cDNA from this screen, we determined that 14-3-3η bound strongly to TTP but not to various control baits, suggesting that this interaction was specific (Fig. 1 A). Mammals encode seven closely related 14-3-3 isoforms, each of ∼31 kDa (37Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated proteins, generally as dimers, and often bind to more than one site in the same protein (35Yaffe M.B.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7410-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 binding influences the activity of several proteins, and localizes others to the cytoplasm in response to signals (37Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins also act as signal-responsive anti-apoptotic factors by binding to phosphorylated forms of regulators such as the A20 protein, Forkhead-related transcription factors, the apoptosis-inducing kinase ASK1, and the BH3-only protein BAD. Because TTP is a phosphoprotein that induces apoptosis, and because its localization within the cell is influenced by extracellular stimuli and growth conditions (14Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we chose to investigate the specificity and functional significance of TTP-14-3-3 binding. To test further the specificity of TTP-14-3-3 binding, we expressed TTP in 3T3 cells by transfection, and assayed whether it bound in vitro to a mixture of bacterially expressed 14-3-3 isoforms that were fused to GST. TTP bound robustly to the GST-14-3-3 protein mix but not to GST alone (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6). Similarly, fusion proteins in which TTP, TIS11b, and TIS11d were each linked at their N terminus to GFP bound comparably well to a GST-14-3-3η protein in vitro, whereas GFP alone did not bind, suggesting that binding to 14-3-3 is characteristic of all three TTP/TIS11 proteins (Fig. 1 C). TTP that was expressed in mammalian cells bound comparably well to fusion proteins that corresponded to each of the seven closely related mammalian 14-3-3 isoforms (Fig. 2, A and B; GST-14-3-3ε is not shown). These GST-linked 14-3-3 isoforms bound preferentially to distinct but overlapping sets of TTP species that appeared larger than the predicted TTP molecular mass of 34 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–7). As reported previously (14Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6461-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 43Carballo E. Cao H. Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Campbell D. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42580-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), treatment of transfected cell lysates with phosphatase converted these TTP species to a less heterogeneous group of faster-migrating forms, indicating that they represented different phosphorylated forms of TTP (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). Interaction with 14-3-3 proteins was completely abrogated by dephosphorylation of TTP in these cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–10), indicating that binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TTP is phosphorylation-dependent. Phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding generally involves a conserved phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residue flanked by basic, aromatic, and aliphatic amino acids, along with additional serine and threonine residues (44van Hemert M.J. Steensma H.Y. van Heusden G.P. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Combinatorial screening using phosphoserine-oriented peptide libraries have identified two optimal classes of 14-3-3 binding consensus motifs, in which an arginine or lysine residue is preferred at either the −3 (Type I) or −4 (Type II) position relative to the phosphorylated residue, with nearby amino acids also being important (35Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Of these two consensus motifs, only Type I sites have been definitively identified previously as 14-3-3 targets in vivo. These screens have also indicated that individual 14-3-3 isoforms differ only subtly in their binding specificities. To identify TTP sequences that are required for 14-3-3 binding, we first analyzed a series of TTP deletion mutants (Fig. 3 A). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, the region of TTP located C-terminal to the zinc fingers was both necessary and sufficient for 14-3-3 binding (Fig. 3 B). This conclusion was supported by analysis of binding in vitro between a mixture of GST-fused 14-3-3 proteins, and GFP-tagged TTP mutants that had been expressed in 293T cells (Fig. 3 C). GFP-TTP and GFP-TTP(Zn-C) bound robustly to the GST-14-3-3 mix in this in vitro assay, even though they were expressed at the lowest relative levels (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2 and 6). GFP-TTP(C) also bound significantly to the GST-14-3-3 mix, but GFP and the other TTP mutants did not (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1, 3,4, and 5). Within the TTP C-terminal region, we identified four sequence elements that match the previously identified 14-3-3 binding consensus motifs with varying degrees of success (Fig. 3 D). Two of these elements are loosely conserved among all three TTP/TIS11 proteins (at TTP Ser-178 and Ser-206), and two are present only in TTP. To investigate whether these TTP elements are required for 14-3-3 binding, within each one we substituted alanine for the amino acid which 14-3-3 binding consensuses predict should be phosphorylated (Fig. 3 D). Binding of TTP to a 14-3-3 protein mixture was significantly reduced only by the TTP S178A mutation (Fig. 3 E, lane 6), which disrupts a predicted type II 14-3-3 binding site (35Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Because 14-3-3 often binds to pairs of sites in the same protein (38Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), we similarly analyzed pairs of these Ala substitutions in all possible combinations, but none diminished binding compared with the corresponding single amino acid mutations (not shown). To determine whether TTP and 14-3-3 proteins interact specifically in vivo, we assayed for binding between TTP mutants and 14-3-3 proteins that were co-expressed in the cell line 293T, which produces anti-apoptotic adenovirus products and is relatively resistant to TTP-induced apoptosis (31Johnson B.A. Geha M. Blackwell T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Supporting the findings shown in Fig. 3(B and C), in this assay both TTP and the TTP(Zn-C) mutant could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated along with HA-tagged 14-3-3β by the HA antibody (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–4 and 7). The S178A substitution significantly reduced co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3β and TTP, and eliminated detectable binding of HA-14-3-3β to TTP(Zn-C) (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4, 5, 7, and 8). In parallel transfections, TTP was comparably co-immunoprecipitated by other HA-tagged 14-3-3 isoforms (not shown). To assay for in vivo binding between 14-3-3 and other TTP/TIS11 proteins, we co-expressed HA-14-3-3β along with GFP-tagged TTP, TIS11b, and TIS11d. Like GFP-TTP, GFP-TIS11b and GFP-TIS11d each co-immunoprecipitated with HA-14-3-3β (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6–9). Specific co-immunoprecipitation of GFP-TTP and HA-14-3-3β was reduced by the S178A mutation and eliminated by deletion of the TTP C-terminal region (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–5). We assayed for binding between transfected TTP and endogenous 14-3-3 by using a TTP antibody to co-immunoprecipitate 14-3-3 (Fig. 4 C). When TTP was present, co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous 14-3-3 was elevated significantly over background (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–3). This binding was abrogated by the S178A mutation (Fig. 4 C, lane 4), indicating that Ser-178 is important for binding to endogenous 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins inhibit apoptosis by binding to various pro-apoptotic proteins (37Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether TTP might cause apoptosis, in part, by titrating 14-3-3 proteins away from these anti-apoptotic interactions. To address this question, we first investigated whether the S178A substitution influenced the ability of TTP to induce apoptosis. TTP S178A induced apoptosis comparably to TTP over a range of input DNA concentrations (Fig. 5 B), despite its significantly reduced binding to 14-3-3 proteins (Figs. 3 E and 4). TTP and TTP S178A were also similarly capable of sensitizing cells to the apoptotic stimulus of TNFα (not shown). In addition, although TTP(Zn-C) S178A did not bind detectably to 14-3-3 (Fig. 4 A), it induced apoptosis comparably to TTP(Zn-C) (Fig. 5,A and B). The S178A substitution did not influence the levels in which either TTP or TTP(Zn-C) was expressed in these transfections (Fig. 4 A). Finally, simultaneous overexpression of 14-3-3 proteins did not attenuate TTP-induced apoptosis or differentially affect induction of apoptosis by either TTP or TTP S178A (not shown). These findings suggest that induction of apoptosis by TTP neither requires 14-3-3 binding at Ser-178 nor is mediated by TTP sequestering cellular pools of 14-3-3. Precedents set by various proteins suggest that 14-3-3 binding might influence how TTP is localized within the cell (37Yaffe M.B. Elia A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 38Muslin A.J. Xing H. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To test this model, we first investigated how 14-3-3 co-expression influences localization of TTP in HeLa cells. We used immunofluorescence to examine the subcellular localization o"

The reduced PKA activity results in neural tube defects that are specifically localized posterior to the forelimb buds and lead to spina bifida.

Decreased PKA activity causes dorsal expansion of Sonic hedgehog signal response in the thoracic to sacral regions correlating with the regions of morphological abnormalities.

Earlier studies have suggested potential requirements for PKA activity in regulating oocyte maturation in vertebrates (1Bornslaeger E.A. Mattei P. Schultz R.M. Dev.

Lack of PKA activity leads to ectopic expression of Hh target genes in Drosophila imaginal discs (4Perrimon N. Cell. 1995; 80: 517-520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Manipulation of PKA activity in vertebrates has also suggested that the negative regulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is conserved (5Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 6Epstein D.J. Marti E. Scott M.P. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fan C.M.

Tessier-Lavigne M. Beachy P.A. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Shh signaling has been implicated in diverse processes in vertebrate development including cartilage differentiation, myotome and sclerotome specification, limb morphogenesis, and the specification of different neuronal cell types along the dorsoventral axis of the neural tube (9Goodrich L.V. Scott M.P. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1243-1257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,10Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Whether PKA is involved in all of these processes and how PKA functions as a negative regulator (directly in the Hedgehog pathway or in a parallel pathway) are unclear. There are two catalytic (Cα and Cβ) and four regulatory (RIα, RIβ, RIIα, and RIIβ) subunit genes of PKA identified in mice (11McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These regulatory and catalytic subunits assemble into a heterotetramer composed of two C and two R subunits, and this PKA holoenzyme dissociates to release active C subunit when cAMP binds to the R subunits. Although each of the regulatory subunit genes encodes a single protein isoform, the catalytic subunit genes encode multiple variants. The Cα gene encodes two variants, Cα1 and Cα2, from two distinct promoters. In adult mice, Cα1 is expressed ubiquitously, whereas Cα2 is testis-specific (12Desseyn J.L. Burton K.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6433-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Cβ gene produces three splice variants, Cβ1, Cβ2, and Cβ3. Although Cβ1 is found in all tissues examined, Cβ2 and Cβ3 are brain-specific (13Guthrie C.R. Skalhegg B.S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29560-29565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of PKA isoforms have also been examined by in situ hybridization in mouse embryos at late organogenesis stage, showing an expression pattern similar to that in adult mice (14Cadd G. McKnight G.S. Neuron. 1989; 3: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All studies on the roles of PKA in vertebrate development have utilized transgenic or pharmacological manipulations, which have limitations in their ability to mimic the spatial and temporal patterns of endogenous activity of PKA. One way to solve this problem is to use PKA knockout mice, and we have created null mutations in each of the four regulatory and two catalytic subunits of PKA expressed in the mouse. The only single knockout to show developmental abnormalities is the RIα regulatory subunit null mutation. The RIα knockout mouse dies during embryonic development because of a severe defect in mesoderm formation resulting from an increase in basal PKA activity. 2P. S. Amieux, D. Howe, H.

McKnight, submitted for publication. The present study reports developmental consequences of decreased PKA activity in mice. A PKA-deficient mouse was generated with only one functional catalytic subunit allele, either Cα or Cβ, of PKA. The mutant mice with reduced PKA activity developed localized neural tube defects (NTDs). The spinal neural tube defect occurred at the thoracic to sacral regions of the neural tube, was 100% penetrant, and could lead to spina bifida in newborn mice, whereas exencephaly (open cranial neural tube) was partially penetrant and only present in mice with a single Cβ allele remaining. Histological examination of the abnormal spinal neural tube revealed a closed neural tube with an enlarged lumen and abnormal neuroepithelium. Marker analysis showed dorsal expansion of Shh-dependent cell types, resulting in a ventralized neuronal identity in the affected neural tube. Decreasing PKA activity also resulted in an increase in apoptotic cell death in the abnormal neuroepithelium and dorsal root ganglia, suggesting that PKA activity plays an anti-apoptotic role in the developing neural tube. All of the defects were observed in the posterior neural tube from the thoracic to sacral regions, whereas the cervical neural tube appeared normal, suggesting differential dependence on PKA activity along the anterior-posterior axis. The Cα and Cβ1 knockout mice were generated as previously described (15Skalhegg B.S. Huang Y., Su, T. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Burton K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar, 16Qi M. Zhuo M. Skalhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Cα+/−Cβ1+/− heterozygous mice were maintained on a 129/C57BL6 mixed background. Genotyping of both Cα and Cβ alleles was performed on tail DNA by PCR analysis. The wild type Cα allele was detected by a pair of primers (CTGACCTTTGAGTATCTGCAC and GTCCCACACAAGGTCCAAGTA), which amplify a 250-nucleotide fragment of the intron between exons 6 and 7. The Cα knockout allele was detected by another pair of primers (GTGGTTTGTCCAAACTCATCAATGT and AGACTACTGCTCTATCACTGA), which amplify a 270-nucleotide fragment of the region between the 3′ end of the neomycin resistance gene and a portion of the intron just 3′ to exon 8. Genotyping of the Cβ wild type allele was performed using the primers Cβ PCR-1B (CCGTCATCCCTGCTTGCGGA) and Cβ PCR 2 (CTCCACTTCGCTGCCTTTCT), which amplify a 69-nucleotide fragment in the first exon. The knockout Cβ1 allele was detected using the primers Cβ PCR-1B and Cβ neo-2 (ATCCTCATCCTGTCTCTTGA), which amplify a 480-nucleotide fragment including the 5′ portion of exon 1 and the 5′ end of the neomycin resistance gene. PKA-deficient mice with different mutant combinations of Cα and Cβ1 alleles were generated by intercrossing Cα+/−Cβ1+/− heterozygous mice. When the vaginal plug was detected in the morning, noon of the same day was considered as E0.5 for the timing of embryos. All dissection was performed in M2 medium (Sigma). Genotyping of embryos was performed by PCR analysis using yolk sac DNA. After removing skin and viscera, carcasses were fixed overnight in 95% ethanol and stained overnight using 0.015% alcian blue in a solution of 4 parts of 95% ethanol and 1 part of acetic acid. Samples were put back in 95% ethanol for 2–5 h and then incubated in 0.5% KOH for 4–5 days. Skeletons were stained in 0.015% alizarin red, 0.5% KOH and cleared in 0.5% KOH, 20% glycerol for about 2 days. Skeletons were stored and photographed in a 1:1 mixture of glycerol and 95% ethanol. Embryos were fixed overnight in Methacarns (6 parts of methanol, 3 parts of chloroform, and 1 part of acetic acid) at room temperature and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 8 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were viewed under a Nikon microscope and photographed. Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 2–4 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and submerged in 30% sucrose plus PBS overnight at 4 °C. Samples were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek) and cryosectioned at 20 μm. Sections were washed with PBS and blocked using 10% goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubation of primary antibodies was performed at 4 °C in 1% goat serum plus PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 overnight. Secondary antibody was fluorescein-conjugated goat IgG fraction to mouse IgG (ICN, Aurora, OH). Sections were visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal laser scanning microscope, and images were captured using COSMOS software. The antibodies used in this study are described and referenced in the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank data base at the University of Iowa. Immunohistochemistry for cleaved caspase-3 was performed according to manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). The secondary antibody was biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG followed by fluorescein avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The sections were visualized using a Leica spectral confocal microscope. RNA in situ hybridization was carried out as described (17Spector D. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled probe. Immunological detection was performed using preabsorbed anti-digoxigenin-AP Fab fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and colored with BM Purple AP substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Wild type C57/BL6 embryos at E9.5 were used for dissection of the following three portions of the neural tube: posterior neural tube (thoracic to sacral), anterior neural tube (cervical/brachial), and cranial neural tube. The dissection was performed in PBS, and tissues including the body wall, limb buds, heart, and the brachial arches were removed. Samples from a total of 65 embryos were pooled together and then homogenized in buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mmTris, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% deoxycholate sodium salt, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Forty micrograms of protein were loaded onto individual lanes of a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were stained with 0.2% Ponceau S before blocking overnight in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20) and probed with anti-Cα or anti-Cβ polyclonal antibodies. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody and visualized using the Amersham ECL system. Protein homogenates from the dissected neural tubes were assayed for kinase activity in the presence and absence of cAMP using Kemptide (Sigma) as a substrate as described (18Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate PKA function during embryonic development, we generated a PKA-deficient mouse with only one functional catalytic subunit allele by crossing the Cα and Cβ1 knockout mice. Cα and Cβ, the two catalytic subunit genes of PKA, had been previously disrupted using gene targeting in ES cells in mice. The Cα knockout disrupts exons 6–8 and eliminates expression of both Cα1 and Cα2 (15Skalhegg B.S. Huang Y., Su, T. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Burton K.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 630-639PubMed Google Scholar). In these animals, PKA activity was greatly reduced in all tissues except brain, where there was only a 50% decrease of PKA activity because of a compensatory increase of Cβ proteins. The Cβ1 knockout used in these studies is disrupted in exon1 preventing expression of Cβ1 but allowing synthesis of Cβ2 and Cβ3 in brain (13Guthrie C.R. Skalhegg B.S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29560-29565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Qi M. Zhuo M. Skalhegg B.S. Brandon E.P. Kandel E.R. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There was no significant change of PKA activity or apparent compensation of Cα levels in all tissues examined. Mice with one or two mutant C subunit alleles, either Cα or Cβ1, were born with no apparent embryonic defects (Table I). However, PKA-deficient mice with three mutant C subunit alleles were found to have malformations in their spinal columns (Fig. 1A). The spinal column defects in newborn PKA-deficient pups were located in their thoracic and lumbar regions. The malformed area was not covered by the vertebral arches, but only by skin. Skeleton preparation from the mutant newborn pups revealed that the vertebral arches failed to fuse at the dorsal midline between forelimbs and hindlimbs, whereas all other components of the vertebrae were present with regular ossification (Fig. 1, B and C). The malformation of vertebral arches defines the mutation in PKA-deficient mice as spina bifida. The spine also showed a ventral curvature at the defective region. The defective phenotype was 100% penetrant. The mutant pups, when kept with their parents, were rejected and left out of the litter, and later died probably from starvation. Moreover, all 22 mutant pups obtained were Cα+/−Cβ1−/− with a single functional Cα allele. None of them were found to have two mutant Cα alleles and a single functional Cβ allele. Analysis of embryos from timed mating revealed that the mutant embryos with a single functional Cβ allele died by embryonic day 14 (E14), indicating a more severe phenotype.Table IConsequences of successively removing catalytic subunit alleles of PKA in miceNos. of functional alleles of CGenotypesPhenotypes4Cα+/+Cβ1+/+Wild-type3Cα+/−Cβ1+/+ Cα+/+Cβ1+/−Normal in appearance2Cα+/−Cβ1+/− Cα−/−Cβ1+/+ Cα+/+Cβ1−/−Normal in appearance Growth retardation, male sterility Normal in appearance1Cα+/−Cβ1−/− Cα−/−Cβ1+/−100% spinal neural tube defects 75% spinal neural tube defects; 25% spinal neural tube defects and exencephaly0Cα−/−Cβ1−/−Early embryonic lethality Open table in a new tab Embryos were examined from E8.5 to E12.5 to ascertain when the spinal column defect in PKA-deficient mice occurred during embryogenesis. The genotypes of embryos were determined by PCR analysis of DNA isolated from visceral yolk sac. Mutant embryos can be first distinguished from their wild type littermates at E9.5 by an expansion of the dorsal neural canal (data not shown). The defect was only observed in the neural tube posterior to the forelimb buds. The anterior spinal cord appeared normal. At E10.5, the neural tube defect became more obvious with varying severity in individual embryos, probably because of embryo to embryo variations in developmental stage. The most severe phenotype was observed as a blister-like bulging of the neural tube along the dorsal midline covering the region of thoracic, lumbar and sacral neural tube (Fig. 1D). The bulging neural tube appeared to be covered by epithelial tissue, which was consistent with the observation of the affected spinal column in the newborn pups. In addition, some of the Cα−/−Cβ1+/−mutants also exhibited exencephaly (open cranial neural tube) (Fig. 1E). As summarized in Table I, all Cα+/−Cβ1−/− embryos had only spinal neural tube defect, whereas approximately one fourth of Cα−/−Cβ1+/− embryos developed exencephaly in addition to the spinal neural tube defect. Exencephaly alone was not observed. As described below, the morphology and the neuronal patterning in the defective spinal neural tube were indistinguishable in embryos of either the Cα+/−Cβ1−/− or Cα−/−Cβ1+/− genotype. Histological examination of the developing neural tube was performed in embryos from E9.5 to E12.5. Transverse sections through the thoracic to sacral neural tube of mutant embryos at E9.5 and also some embryos at E10.5 showed a closed neural tube with an expanded alar plate and enlarged lumen (Fig. 2, A and B). The neural tube at the cervical region appeared normal (data not shown). In the longitudinal sections through the dorsal half of the neural tube, the neuroepithelium appeared expanded (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating a possible overproliferation within the dorsal neural tube at this developmental stage. A similar phenotype in the neural tube has been observed in transgenic embryos expressing a dominant negative form of PKA in dorsal aspects of the mouse central nervous system (6Epstein D.J. Marti E. Scott M.P. McMahon A.P. Development. 1996; 122: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in the spinal cord of mutant embryos to identify cells that have divided. The average number of labeled cells in sections of the affected neural tube of E9.5 and E10.5 embryos at hindlimb level was compared with that in corresponding sections of wild type controls. The result revealed no difference between the mutants and their controls in the number of proliferating cells in the whole transverse sections of neural tube (data not shown), suggesting that the aberrant morphology is not caused by overproliferation. In embryos older than E10.5, the expansion of the neural canal increased dramatically. Transverse sections showed that the lumen was significantly enlarged and the neuroepithelium contained a higher cell density compared with wild type control (Fig. 2, E and F). In addition to the change in neural tube morphology, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also affected. DRG were formed in the mutant E10.5 embryos, even though they appeared disorganized (Fig. 2D), but they regressed at E12.5, suggesting that PKA activity might be required for DRG maintenance. The loss of DRG cells could indicate a possible abnormal cell death in neural crest cell derivatives, which might also occur in the neural tube. To test the possibility of increasing apoptosis in the affected neuroepithelium and neural crest, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect activated caspase-3 in the developing neural tube of E10.5 embryos. Caspase-3 is one of the key executioner caspases of cell death and the activated form of caspase-3 is usually only found in cells undergoing apoptosis. In the neural tube of PKA-deficient embryos, apoptotic cells were frequently observed compared with the rare occurrence of apoptotic cells in wild type embryos (Fig. 3). Most of the apoptotic cells in the mutant were located in dorsal and/or lateral regions of the neural tube. In addition to the neural tube, a more significant increase in cell death was also detected in DRG adjacent to the affected neural tube, but not in DRG at other axial levels of PKA-deficient embryos (Fig. 3C). Despite the observed increase in apoptosis, the total number of apoptotic cells observed in the defective neuroepithelium was still very small and could easily be overcome by the large number of dividing cells in the neural tube. Therefore, the increased cell death is unlikely to be a major determinant of the neuroepithelial abnormality. The more significant increase in DRG cell death may account for the regression of these structures observed in mutant embryos. One interesting phenomenon in our study is that the neural tube defects were only detected posterior to the forelimb buds of PKA-deficient embryos. What makes the posterior part of the spinal neural tube more sensitive to the decrease in PKA activity compared with other regions? One possible reason could be that the expression of the catalytic subunits of PKA are differentially distributed along the anterior-posterior regions of the neural tube, causing PKA activity in some region to be closer to the cellular threshold below which mutations become apparent. The observed mutant phenotype might suggest a lower PKA activity at thoracic to sacral regions. To test this, we dissected the axial structures including the neural tube, paraxial mesoderm, and the attached ectoderm from E9.5 wild type C57/BL6 embryos. The axial structure was collected in three parts: cranial neural tube, anterior (cervical/brachial) neural tube, and posterior (thoracic to sacral) neural tube. Western blots using protein extracts were analyzed to quantitate the expression of C subunits. The analysis demonstrated that there was slightly less C subunit expression in the posterior neural tube compared with the anterior neural tube (Fig. 4A), and this correlated with a 20% decrease in PKA activity in the posterior compared with anterior regions (Fig. 4B). Both the results from Western blot and kinase assay indicate a modest difference in overall expression of catalytic subunits of PKA, but we believe that this is unlikely to explain the dramatic differences we see in morphology and gene expression (see below) in the affected posterior region. The Western analysis also demonstrated that both Cα and Cβ genes were expressed as a single protein isoform, Cα1 and Cβ1, respectively, in the axial tissues of mouse embryos at E9.5. Cα2, the testis-specific isoform in adult mice, was not detectable at this developmental stage, and the brain-specific isoforms, Cβ2 and Cβ3, were also absent. The PKA pathway has been implicated as a negative regulator of Sonic hedgehog signaling in development, and Shh signaling is a major organizer for dorsal/ventral patterning in the neural tube. Therefore, we examined the manifestations of Shh signaling and the specification of neuronal identity in the neural tube of PKA-deficient embryos at E10.5. Shh is sufficient for the induction of floor plate cells (19Roelink H. Augsburger A. Heemskerk J. Korzh V. Norlin S. Ruiz i Altaba A. Tanabe Y. Placzek M. Edlund T. Jessell T.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 761-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), which express Hnf3β and Shh itself. In PKA-deficient embryos, the expression of both Shh and Hnf3β was expanded dorsally (Fig. 5, B and F). Shh expression was detected in the ventral half of the neural tube at levels similar to a normal floor plate. The expression domain of Hnf3β was also greatly expanded in the ventral neural tube, albeit at levels lower than those found at the ventral midline (Fig. 5F). Cells with lower Hnf3β expression did not display typical floor plate morphology, i.e. a single layer with basal nuclei. Interestingly, the dorsal expansion of Shh and Hnf3β expression was correlated only with the abnormal morphology in the affected neural tube. In the cervical neural tube, Shh and Hnf3β were expressed normally (Fig. 5, C and D; data not shown). The same localized effect was also observed with the whole mount in situ hybridization of PKA-deficient embryos at E9.5, which demonstrated that the ectopic expression of Hnf3β was localized to the region posterior to the forelimb buds (Fig. 5G). Shh is required for the induction of motor neurons and adjacent interneuron progenitors in the ventral neural tube, which is mediated by regulating the expression of several homeodomain proteins (20Marti E.

The dorsalized expression of Shh in PKA-deficient embryos may lead to an altered patterning of neuronal identity in the neural tube. We analyzed the pattern of ventral neuronal progenitors in the PKA-deficient neural tube by focusing on the expression of two homeodomain proteins, Pax6 and Nkx2.2. Shh signaling represses the expression of Pax6, which, in turn, represses the expression of Nkx2.2 in V3 interneuron progenitor cells at the region dorsolateral to the floor plate (24Ericson J.

In the affected neural tube of PKA-deficient embryos, the expression of Pax6 was repressed in most of the neural tube, with some dorsal Pax6 expressing cells remaining (Fig. 6B). Consistent with this, expression of Nkx2.2 was dorsally expanded with the dorsal boundary extending into the medial/dorsal ventricular zone of the neural tube (Fig. 6D). The dorsalized expression of Pax6 could be a consequence of ectopic activation of the Shh response in the affected neural tube. These results indicate a change of neuronal identity in the affected neural tube that leads to a ventralized neural tube, which we confirmed by examining the induction of motor neurons. Motor neuron progenitor cells, which are located immediately dorsal to V3 interneuron progenitors, express low levels of Pax6 but not Nkx2.2. The post-mitotic motor neurons were detected by the expression of the homeodomain proteins Islet1/2, which mark DRG cells and differentiated motor neurons (24Ericson J. Rashbass P. Schedl A. Brenner-Morton S. Kawakami A. van Heyningen V. Jessell T.M. Briscoe J. Cell. 1997; 90: 169-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In wild type mice, Islet1/2-expressing motor neurons are located immediately dorsal to V3 interneurons in ventrolateral regions adjacent to the ventricular zone of the neural tube (Fig. 6G). In PKA-deficient mice, Islet1/2-labeled motor neurons were dorsally expanded into the intermediate zone, consistent with the Nkx2.2 expansion and Pax6 repression (Fig. 6H). Because of the appearance of ventral neuronal progenitors in the dorsal neural tube, we next examined the fate of dorsal cell types in the affected neural tube.

We have now identified the other A2RE-binding proteins as hnRNP A1/A1B, hnRNP B1, and four isoforms of hnRNP A3.

Establishment of asymmetry in cells requires selective localization of proteins. This may be accomplished by directed protein transport, a well established pathway for plasma membrane and secreted proteins, or by trafficking and subsequent localization of mRNA.

The granules are localized in the myelin compartment, and the RNA cargo is translated, with the MBP being incorporated into the myelin membrane. Deletion studies led to the conclusion that a small element in the 3′-untranslated region of the MBP mRNA, the RNA transport sequence (RTS), is sufficient and necessary for this cytoplasmic RNA transport in oligodendrocytes (17Ainger K.

The predominant RTS-binding protein from a number of rat tissues is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2 (25Hoek K.S. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7021-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a constituent of nuclear “core particles” that bind to nascent hnRNA and participate in various aspects of RNA processing. Recent mutational analyses have shown a close correlation between oligoribonucleotide binding to hnRNP A2 and the ability to support cytoplasmic RNA trafficking in oligodendrocytes (26Munro T.P.

Antisense oligonucleotide experiments have added support to the proposition that hnRNP A2 is involved in this RTS-dependent trafficking, and the RTS has consequently been renamed the hnRNP A2 response element (A2RE). hnRNP A2 also enhances cap-dependent translation of mRNA containing the A2RE (27Kwon S. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other, less abundant, rat brain proteins that are also reproducibly isolated on immobilized A2RE have not previously been identified. Direct Edman sequencing of proteins extracted from SDS/polyacrylamide gel slices was unsuccessful, suggesting that all are N-terminally blocked. By using Edman microsequencing and mass spectrometric fingerprinting of tryptic peptides, Western blotting with antibodies raised against peptides unique to individual members of the hnRNP A/B family, and cloning and sequencing of rat and human cDNAs, we have now identified four of the A2RE-binding proteins as isoforms of hnRNP A3 and a fifth component as hnRNP A1. hnRNP A3 has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and shown in biosensor and UV cross-linking electrophoretic mobility shift experiments to recognize A2RE directly, suggesting that hnRNPA3 is not bound to RNA through interaction with hnRNP A2. We have also found that hnRNPs A2 and A3 and microinjected A2RE-containing RNA are localized in cytoplasmic transport granules in cultured neurons, suggesting that hnRNP A3, like hnRNP A2, participates in the trafficking of A2RE-containing RNA. These are the first reported experiments on hnRNP A3, which has recently been identified as a component of 40 S hnRNP complexes (28Plomaritoglou A. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Guialis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but has otherwise been described only at the cDNA level. Primers designed against the 5′ and 3′ ends of frame shift-corrected human fetal brain ribonucleoprotein (FBRNP; NCBI GI:1710627) DNA coding sequence (nucleotides 31–1140) were purchased from Invitrogen (Mt. Waverly, Australia). NcoI (forward primer) and SacI (reverse primer) restriction sites were added to the 5′ ends of the primers to facilitate insertion of the PCR product into an expression vector. The primers were forward (hA3F) 5′-GTA CCATGGAGGTAAAACCGCCG-3′ and reverse (hA3R) 5′-AGA GAGCTCAGAACCTTCTGCTACCATATCCAC-3′ (coding sequences are underlined, and restriction sites are in italics). 21-day-old Wistar rat brain was snap frozen. Human cerebellar tissue was from a 65-year-old female who died of heart failure. Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The dried RNA-containing pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA purity and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically and by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. RNA-dependent DNA synthesis was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT; Promega, Annandale, Australia, for rat RNA) or SuperScript II (Invitrogen, for human RNA). 2 μg of RNA was used in each RT reaction and primed with oligo(dT)15. Subsequent PCR reactions were performed using the proofreading enzymes platinum Taq high fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, for rat) and ELongase (Invitrogen, for human) with 40 pmol of each primer in each 50-μl reaction. 3′-RACE was performed using an internal gene-specific primer for reverse transcription. Terminal transferase (Invitrogen) was used for homopolymeric 3′ C-tailing of the first DNA strand. Nested PCR was performed with RACE anchor and adapter primers (5′ AP and AUAP; Invitrogen). A modified oligo(dT) (3′ AP; Invitrogen) and internal primers were used for the RT step in 3′-RACE. Purified RT-PCR products were ligated into pGemT-Easy (Promega) and electroporated into E. coli DH5α cells. Cells bearing plasmids containing an appropriately sized insert were grown overnight, the plasmids were isolated, and the inserts were amplified using M13 universal primers and hA3F and hA3R for sequencing in both forward and reverse directions with partial overlap. DNA from three individual clones was sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using CLUSTAL W version 1.8 (29Thompson J.D. Higgins G.D. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) to generate consensus sequence and protein alignment, and the programs at ExPASy (/au.expasy.org/) were used for conceptual translation of the DNA sequences (30Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.-C. Williams K.L. Appel R.D. Hochstrasser D.F. Link A.J. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 531-552Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against peptides unique to each of the human hnRNPs A1, A2/B1, B1, and A3: SKSESPKEPEQLC-NH2 (A1), GGNFGFGDSR GGC-NH2(A2/B1), VKPPPGRPQPDSGRRC-NH2 (A3(N)), GYDGYNEGGNFC-NH2 (A3(C)), and KTLETVPLERKKRC-NH2 (B1). These peptides were synthesized with C-terminal amide groups (Mimetopes, Melbourne, Australia) and conjugated to diptheria toxoid before injection into rabbits. The purified antibodies were isolated from antisera by adsorption onto the corresponding immobilized antigen. Attempts at direct Edman sequencing of the A2RE-binding proteins were unsuccessful, suggesting that they were N-terminally blocked. Peptides were therefore generated by excision of bands from SDS/polyacrylamide gels and in-gel digestion with 1.5 times the gel volume of 0.02 mg/ml trypsin (Promega) in 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 8.1 (31Speicher K.D. Kolbas O. Harper S. Speicher D.W. J. Biomol. Tech. 2000; 11: 74-86PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a microbore C18 column and running a gradient of 10–40% acetonitrile over 60 min in 1% trifluoroacetic acid at 30 μl/min and sequenced on a Procise cLC sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass spectral analysis was performed on an ABI QSTAR Pulsar i spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with an electrospray ion source interfaced to a microbore HPLC. The peptides were separated on a C3 reverse-phase column, the output of which was split between the HPLC detector and the mass spectrometer. The proteins were identified by comparison of the observed tryptic peptide masses with those predicted from the gene sequences. For each of the hnRNP A3 isoforms, fragments with masses within ± 0.2 Da of the theoretical value covering at least 33% of the primary sequence were found. Full-length rat hnRNP A3 transcript was amplified and ligated into pGemT. The sequence was verified by sequencing before ligation in-frame into pET30a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI), which had been mutated to generate a second thrombin cleavage site in place of an enterokinase site between the hexahistidine tag and hnRNP A3. This vector was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that were grown to an A600 of 0.6 before induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was passed through a metal ion affinity column (Talon IMAC resin, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) equilibrated with 50 mmNaH2PO4, 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7, or 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 7. The hexahistidine fusion protein was released from the resin by increasing the column buffer imidazole concentration to 200 mm and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Two proteins with the tag removed and an additional Ser-Gly at the N terminus were generated by cleavage with thrombin; they were identified by electrospray/time-of-flight mass spectrometry performed on an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar i. An IAsys resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) was used to determine the equilibrium affinities for the interactions of hnRNP A3 with A2RE, with NS1 (CAAGCACCGAACCCGCAACUG) being used as a control to distinguish specific binding from nonspecific binding. Recombinant hnRNP A3 was covalently attached to the carboxymethyldextran-coated sensing surface of a biosensor cuvette using a standard procedure (32Davies R.J. Edwards P.R. Watts H.J. Lowe C.R. Buckle P.E. Yeung D. Kinning T.M. Pollard-Knight D.V. Crabb J.W. Techniques in Protein Chemistry V. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). After washing the biosensor cuvette with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20, hnRNP A3 was added to the cuvette, and the equilibrium response was recorded (∼20 min). Unbound protein was removed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Binding of oligonucleotides was monitored at 0.4-s intervals at 25 °C until equilibrium had been attained (∼15 min). The cuvette was washed with 5 mm NaOH to remove the oligonucleotide and with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 to restore the base line between experiments. Recombinant proteins were obtained as described above. Oligoribonucleotide 32P end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and protein were mixed in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 4% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 20–30 min on ice. The reaction mixtures were then irradiated with 250 mJ of 254-nm light in a Bio-Rad GS Genelinker UV chamber. The samples were run on 15 × 15-cm SDS/12% or 15% polyacrylamide gels. A2RE-binding rat brain proteins were isolated using affinity isolation on superparamagnetic particles bearing immobilized A2RE or NS1, as described previously (25Hoek K.S. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7021-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to the particles were eluted by heating for 10 min at 65 °C in 0.1% SDS, 1 mmdithiothreitol, or 30% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed on SDS/polyacrylamide gels or used for mass spectrometry. Hippocampus dissected from embryonic day 18 Wistar rats was digested with trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution, washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution, placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and mechanically dissociated by trituration. The cells were plated at 600 cells/mm2 on poly(l-lysine)-coated glass-bottomed microwells (MatTek, Ashland, MA). After 2 h of incubation to allow cell attachment, medium containing Neurobasal, N2 supplements (1:100 dilution), B27 supplements (1:50 dilution), and 5% (v/v) gentamicin was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The medium was replaced every other day. All reagents were from Invitrogen except where noted otherwise. Cultured rat brain neurons were washed in PBS then fixed for 20 min in 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS. After further washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized by incubation for 2 min in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) diluted in the same buffer, washed, and then incubated in 5% goat serum in PBS for 10 min. For visualization of hnRNPs A2 and A3, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the primary antibody (rabbit antibody against hnRNP A3 and mouse antibody to hnRNP A2), washed extensively, blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS for 10 min, incubated in secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse IgG and Alexa-598-conjugated goat anti-rabbit; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min, and washed with PBS. Finally, 70% glycerol containing an anti-fading agent (Dabco) was added to the cells before they were imaged on either Zeiss LSM 410 or Bio-Rad MRC 800 laser scanning confocal microscopes equipped with ×63 (1.4 NA) and ×60 (1.4 NA) lenses. After 7–14 days in culture, differentiated hippocampal neurons were microinjected with RNA labeled with Alexa-488-UTP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and containing or lacking the A2RE11 (GCCAAGGAGCC) sequence inserted in the 3′-untranslated region between the green fluorescent protein open reading frame and the segment encoding the poly(A) (26Munro T.P.

The cells were injected using a Compic Inject (Cellbiology Trading, Hamburg, Germany) micromanipulator attached to a Zeiss Axiophot inverted microscope. After injection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow transport to occur. To visualize neurites, the cells were incubated for 30 min in mouse anti-MAP2 (Sigma), washed, and incubated for 30 min in Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). Previous experiments (25Hoek K.S. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7021-7029Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 26Munro T.P. Magee R.J. Kidd G.J. Carson J.H.

The most abundant of these proteins was shown by Edman sequencing of tryptic peptides to be hnRNP A2, but the other polypeptides were less abundant and appeared to be N-terminally blocked. Edman protein sequencing of peptides generated from the 38- and 39-kDa bands had indicated that they were closely related to hnRNP A2 but were not alternatively spliced forms of this 36-kDa protein. The peptide sequences matched those deduced from the cDNA sequences of human hnRNP A3 (identified as FBRNP, as corrected in the Swiss Protein Database, accession number P51991) but were insufficient in number and length to unequivocally identify the protein. We have now used immunoblotting to identify the other rat brain A2RE-binding proteins that were eluted from magnetic particles, separated on SDS/polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunodetection with polyclonal antibodies raised against peptide antigens. The peptide antigens were selected using published amino acid sequences for the human hnRNP A1, A2, and B1 proteins, and for A3 a peptide was deduced from our DNA sequence (see below). The proteins detected (Fig. 1B) were hnRNPs A1, A1B (above A1 on the A1 track, ∼40 kDa), A2, B1 (just above A2 on the A2 track, and separately on the B1 track; the topmost band in the A2 track is unidentified), and A3. As shown below, the antibody to hnRNP A3 detects two proteins, but they are not resolved on the short gel used in this experiment. The predominant A2RE-binding proteins are thus the previously identified hnRNP A2 and hnRNP A3. As judged by the staining on polyacrylamide gels, hnRNPs A1, A1B, and B1 are minor components. As a basis for further studies we determined the cDNA sequences of rat and human brain hnRNP A3, initially using for both RT-PCR with primers based on the 5′ and 3′ coding sequences of FBRNP to amplify hnRNP A3-like mRNA. The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between humans and rodents observed for other hnRNPs suggested that these primers would be satisfactory for the latter, a proposition subsequently verified by direct sequencing of the rat DNA in these regions (see below). Two distinct sequences were amplified from multiple clones containing cDNA reverse-transcribed from human brain RNA. One matched and extended the partial murine clone (EMBL accession number Y16641), a truncated expressed sequence tag described as encoding a novel gene product, mBx-3 (28Plomaritoglou A. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Guialis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The second differed from that deduced for the human FBRNP (33Takiguchi S. Tokino T. Imai T. Tanigami A. Koyama K. Nakamura Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 64: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) only by a substitution of the dipeptide Met93-Arg94 in our sequence for Ile-Gly at the C-terminal end of the second RNA recognition motif of FBRNP. These two cDNAs had 96.5% identity at the nucleotide level and 94.2% (357 of 379 residues) at the amino acid level, with the nucleotide differences between these human sequences spread throughout the DNA, suggesting that the two proteins arise from distinct genes, but subsequent searching of the human genome data bases suggested that the second of these cDNAs (corresponding to FBRNP) resulted from transcription of a pseudogene. The first human cDNA sequence differed from the single rat sequence obtained from multiple clones in 55 nucleotide substitutions spread throughout the sequence and by the presence of a TGG insert in the latter, but these differences result only in insertion of a single additional glycine residue near the C terminus of the rat protein, suggesting that these proteins are orthologous. No murine cDNA corresponding to FBRNP was detected by multiple approaches including 3′- and 5′-RACE and direct RT-PCR using total rat brain RNA with an oligo(dT) primer, again suggesting that it represents a pseudogene. However, 5′-RACE did result in the identification of a truncated form of rat DNA, which had a similar but longer 5′-untranslated region and a 66-nucleotide deletion near the 5′ end of the coding region (Fig. 2). This corresponds to a mass change of 2566 Da in the protein. The 3′- and 5′-RACE experiments also confirmed that the human and rat sequences are identical in the regions corresponding to the primers used in the initial amplification of the rat DNA. The sequence of the full and truncated cDNAs are closely related to those reported for A3-like proteins from Xenopus, A3a and A3b (34Good P.J. Rebbert M.L. Dawid I.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32167-32171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A similar sequence is present in hnRNP A3; this suggests that hnRNP A3, like hnRNPs A1 and A2 (39Carson J.H. Cui H. Kreuger W. Schlepchenko B. Brumwell C. Barbarese E. Results Prob. Cell Different. 2000; 34: 69-81Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), may shuttle in and out of the nucleus. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the human hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 reveals a close relationship between them. Overall, the hnRNP A3 amino acid sequence matches hnRNP A1 more closely than it matches hnRNP A2/B1. Within the tandem RNA recognition motif region there are many, mostly conservative, substitutions in hnRNP A2 where the other two proteins are identical and relatively few residues where hnRNP A2 but not hnRNP A1 matches the hnRNP A3 sequence (Fig. 2). In the C-terminal glycine-rich region, this trend is reversed, suggesting that the hnRNP A3 gene may have arisen from the recombination of the 5′ RNA recognition motif-encoding segment of a former hnRNP A1 gene with the 3′ Gly-rich segment of an earlier hnRNP A2 gene. Antibodies were raised against two peptide sequences deduced from the FBRNP and hnRNP A3 gene sequences. The first peptide (VKPPPGRPQPDSGRR), which was used in initial experiments (Fig. 1B), is in the N-terminal alternatively spliced region. The second (GYDGYNEGGNF) is in a segment of the glycine-rich region predicted to be common to all splice variants of A3 but not fully conserved in hnRNPs A1 and A2/B1. In Western blots the first antibody recognized just the 41- and 41.5-kDa bands, suggesting that only these proteins contain the 22-residue segment encoded within exon 1 (Fig. 3). By contrast, the second antibody associated with all four 38-, 39-, 41-, and 41.5-kDa bands, identifying them as hnRNP A3-like proteins and not isoforms of hnRNPs A1 or A2. This identification was confirmed by Edman sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry. Bands cut from stained SDS/polyacrylamide gels were pulverized and digested with trypsin, and the reverse-phase HPLC-purified peptides were subjected to Edman degradation. The resultant amino acid sequences, presented in Table I, confirmed the identification of three of these proteins as hnRNP A3. Each of the tryptic digests of the excised bands was also subject"

Furthermore, living organisms can be exposed to the highly toxic ions of cadmium, lead, mercury, and other metals that are generally considered non-essential. Consequently, a complex network of transport, chelation, and sequestration processes has evolved that functions to maintain the concentrations of essential metal ions in different cellular compartments within the narrow physiological range and to minimize the damage caused by the entry of non-essential metal ions into the cytosol (1O'Halloran T.V.

Here we report on the functional characterization of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe CDF (named Zhf, for zinc homeostasis factor), whose function affects tolerance to a range of metal ions in drastically different fashion; disruption of the gene renders S. pombe cells Zn2+- and Co2+-hypersensitive yet significantly enhances tolerance toward Cd2+ and Ni2+. Electron microscopic protein and zinc localization indicate Zhf-dependent zinc accumulation in the ER. Our findings represent novel evidence for the role of the respective compartment in metal homeostasis and identify a major pathway of zinc storage in the ER. Furthermore, the data provide new insights into the still poorly understood cellular mechanisms of cadmium toxicity.DISCUSSIONTransport of metal ions across intracellular membranes is a key aspect of metal homeostasis. It provides a driving force for the uptake of metal ions across the plasma membrane and contributes to the trafficking and storage of essential metal ions as well as to the detoxification of non-essential metal ions. Members of the CDF family have been implicated in these still poorly understood processes in a diverse range of model systems. Few of them, however, have been assigned a physiological role. Examples include the mammalian Zn2+ transporter ZnT-3, required for the accumulation of zinc in vesicles in nerve cells (28Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 93: 14934-14939Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and CzcD of Ralstonia metallidurans, which is involved in the regulation of the metal-pumping Czc system by mediating the export of inducing cations (10Anton A. Grosse C. Reissmann J. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Metal concentrations in the various compartments of a cell are the function of transport and chelation activities. Thus, it is important to understand the contribution and interaction of such different processes. Is there, for instance, in cells that synthesize phytochelatins, a contribution of transporters independent of the PC pathway to Cd2+ sequestration? In this context a study on CDFs in S. pombe, the most suitable phytochelatin synthase-expressing model system, was initiated. Zhf is one of at least three members of this family in S. pombe(DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numbers CAC05733 and T43145). A mutant strain was generated and characterized with respect to metal tolerance and accumulation. Effects on tolerance toward a range of metal ions were found to be different to an unprecedented degree (Fig. 1).Sequestration capacity and degree of tolerance are very often positively correlated. Chelation and sequestration activities that confer tolerance also drive the uptake of metal ions across the plasma membrane. Synthesis of phytochelatins in S. cerevisiae cells leads to increased tolerance and accumulation of cadmium (20Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A number of CDFs, e.g. mammalian ZnT-2 and ZAT from Arabidopsis, have been shown to mediate Zn2+tolerance as well as increased accumulation of zinc (14Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27van der Zaal B.J. Neuteboom L.W. Pinas J.E. Chardonnens A.N. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. Hooykaas P.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the Zhf-deficient cells were Zn2+-hypersensitive and accumulated less zinc than wild-type cells upon Zn2+ feeding (Figs. 3 and 4). Also, initial Zn2+ uptake rates were only slightly reduced in zhf− cells. Thus, a role in zinc uptake was ruled out, and Zhf was hypothesized to mediate storage of zinc inside the fission yeast cell.The vacuole is generally considered the main storage site for metals in yeast and plant cells. The EDX data (Fig. 3), however, already demonstrated zinc accumulation in zinc-treated wild-type cells outside the vacuoles. This accumulation was not detectable in Zhf-deficient cells. Furthermore, our immunogold labeling data (Fig. 6) indicated localization of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope. The tagged protein was functional as shown by complementation, and no specific signal for the vacuolar membrane, any other cellular compartment, or the plasma membrane was detectable. This gives the results a high degree of confidence despite the expression from a plasmid under control of the constitutive nmt1 promoter. No signal was detectable in sections of cells grown in thiamine-containing medium repressing the promoter. However, localization was further supported by the ESI data (Figs. 7 and 8) that indicated that the sites of reduced zinc accumulation in Δzhf cells likely correspond to the ER structures stained by immunogold labeling.These data, as well as another recent study, demonstrate a major role in zinc homeostasis for the endoplasmic reticulum. The reported localization of MSC2, a CDF family member from S. cerevisiae, in the ER/nucleus and the higher nuclear zinc content of msc2− cells suggested a requirement for transporter-facilitated exchange of zinc between cytosol and nucleus at least under certain stress conditions (30Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Zhf is hypothesized to mediate the transport of zinc into the ER and the nuclear envelope in fission yeast. Zhf would thereby contribute to zinc storage and to supplying zinc to zinc-requiring proteins processed in the endoplasmic reticulum. The extreme Zn2+ sensitivity of Δzhf cells demonstrates that Zhf-dependent transport represents a major pathway of zinc storage in S. pombe cells. The fact that Zhf deficiency is not lethal, however, suggests the existence of additional transport systems providing at least the minimum required zinc influx into the ER. This influx may well be too low to result in any accumulation detectable by ESI.Overall accumulation and cytosolic concentrations of available cadmium were found to be also reduced in Zhf-deficient cells. The apparent decrease in sequestrating capacity, however, was not accompanied by an increase in sensitivity, as was observed for instance for the vacuolar membrane-localized transporters ZRC1 in S. cerevisiae (7Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or Hmt1 in S. pombe (31Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In these cases, a transporter residing in an endomembrane detoxifies cadmium and drives the uptake of cadmium. Zhf, however, appears to drive cadmium uptake in a similar fashion yet does not contribute to detoxification. On the contrary,zhf disruption resulted in a dramatic elevation of Cd2+ tolerance. Different hypotheses to explain this surprising observation were assessed. The Cd2+ tolerance phenotype of Δzhf cells might be an indirect result of the effects on zinc content and distribution. However, no evidence for a dependence of this phenotype on the major known cadmium detoxification pathways could be found. Cd2+ ions compete with Zn2+ ions for binding sites in proteins. Higher Zn2+ levels due to the inactivation of a zinc storage mechanism therefore could suppress Cd2+ toxicity. Cytosolic Zn2+ content under control conditions, however, does not appear to be increased in the zhf knock-out strain as indicated by the results of EDX analysis. Is the Cd2+tolerance phenotype then a mere consequence of reduced uptake of Cd2+ into the cells? Zn2+ transporters represent one of the entry pathways for Cd2+ (32Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 33Pence N.S. Larsen P.B. Ebbs S.D. Letham D.L. Lasat M.M. Garvin D.F. Eide D. Kochian L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). However, no effect of Zhf inactivation on short-term uptake rates of Cd2+ could be detected (Fig. 2 B). Together with the fact that zhf disruption caused a dramatic protective effect in pcs−, cells which are impaired in cytosolic cadmium binding, this led us to hypothesize that Zhf mediates cadmium transport to a particularly sensitive site inside the cell, which based on the protein and zinc localization data would be the endoplasmic reticulum. To find additional evidence as to whether the Cd2+ phenotype is an indirect effect or dependent on a cadmium transport activity of Zhf, we compared complementation of Δzhf cells by the endogenous transporter with complementation by a CDF whose substrate specificity had been studied. Although a number of CDFs studied to date seem to transport Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and also Ni2+ ions, as most recently shown for Thlaspi transporters (34Persans M.W. Nieman K. Salt D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9995-10000Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis ZAT apparently transports Zn2+ but not Cd2+ (37Bloss T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When cells were transformed with the respective genes it was observed that both are functionally expressed and complement the Zn2+hypersensitivity of Δzhf cells. In contrast to plasmid-encoded Zhf, ZAT only partially restored the Cd2+sensitivity. This uncoupling of the zinc- and cadmium-related phenotypes suggests that interference with zinc homeostasis is not the cause of the protection against Cd2+. Rather, these data indicate an important insight into the mechanisms of Cd2+toxicity that to date are poorly understood. Displacement of Zn2+ in proteins is one current hypothesis to explain the harmful effects of Cd2+ exposure (35Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). Zhf appears to directly mediate Cd2+ toxicity by transporting Cd2+ ions into the ER and the nuclear envelope, a cellular compartment that apparently is particularly cadmium-sensitive. Cd2+ ions may interfere with the folding of proteins in the ER or more specifically the loading of zinc-requiring proteins with Zn2+ ions. Also, transport of Cd2+ ions into the ER lumen may lead to disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis as recent evidence suggests a role of Ca2+ ions as a signaling molecule in the ER (36Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The transport dependence of Cd2+ toxicity would also have implications for the efficiency of cytosolic chelation of cadmium by phytochelatins, the main cadmium buffer in many different organisms. The PC detoxification pathway is not sequestering cadmium quantitatively. A fraction is available for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum or other organelles. Hence, Δzhf cells accumulate slightly less cadmium than wild-type cells. In pcs− cells that are impaired in the cytosolic binding of cadmium, this fraction is much larger, which would explain why the zhf disruption results in such an extreme protection against Cd2+ in PC-deficient cells.In conclusion, our data suggest that the transporter Zhf is localized in the ER/nuclear envelope and plays an important role in cellular zinc homeostasis by mediating the transport of zinc into the endoplasmic reticulum. Zhf activity provides a driving force for the accumulation of Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ ions. Zhf-dependent removal from the cytosol results in a protection against Zn2+ and Co2+ toxicity. In contrast, Cd2+ toxicity is enhanced because the transport of cadmium into a particularly cadmium-sensitive organelle is mediated by Zhf. Ions of heavy metals such as iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, or nickel are essential micronutrients, required for function of a large number of proteins. At supraoptimal concentrations, however, these metal ions can be detrimental. Furthermore, living organisms can be exposed to the highly toxic ions of cadmium, lead, mercury, and other metals that are generally considered non-essential. Consequently, a complex network of transport, chelation, and sequestration processes has evolved that functions to maintain the concentrations of essential metal ions in different cellular compartments within the narrow physiological range and to minimize the damage caused by the entry of non-essential metal ions into the cytosol (1O'Halloran T.V.

Here we report on the functional characterization of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe CDF (named Zhf, for zinc homeostasis factor), whose function affects tolerance to a range of metal ions in drastically different fashion; disruption of the gene renders S. pombe cells Zn2+- and Co2+-hypersensitive yet significantly enhances tolerance toward Cd2+ and Ni2+. Electron microscopic protein and zinc localization indicate Zhf-dependent zinc accumulation in the ER. Our findings represent novel evidence for the role of the respective compartment in metal homeostasis and identify a major pathway of zinc storage in the ER. Furthermore, the data provide new insights into the still poorly understood cellular mechanisms of cadmium toxicity. DISCUSSIONTransport of metal ions across intracellular membranes is a key aspect of metal homeostasis. It provides a driving force for the uptake of metal ions across the plasma membrane and contributes to the trafficking and storage of essential metal ions as well as to the detoxification of non-essential metal ions. Members of the CDF family have been implicated in these still poorly understood processes in a diverse range of model systems. Few of them, however, have been assigned a physiological role. Examples include the mammalian Zn2+ transporter ZnT-3, required for the accumulation of zinc in vesicles in nerve cells (28Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 93: 14934-14939Crossref Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 29Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and CzcD of Ralstonia metallidurans, which is involved in the regulation of the metal-pumping Czc system by mediating the export of inducing cations (10Anton A. Grosse C. Reissmann J. Pribyl T. Nies D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Metal concentrations in the various compartments of a cell are the function of transport and chelation activities. Thus, it is important to understand the contribution and interaction of such different processes. Is there, for instance, in cells that synthesize phytochelatins, a contribution of transporters independent of the PC pathway to Cd2+ sequestration? In this context a study on CDFs in S. pombe, the most suitable phytochelatin synthase-expressing model system, was initiated. Zhf is one of at least three members of this family in S. pombe(DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession numbers CAC05733 and T43145). A mutant strain was generated and characterized with respect to metal tolerance and accumulation. Effects on tolerance toward a range of metal ions were found to be different to an unprecedented degree (Fig. 1).Sequestration capacity and degree of tolerance are very often positively correlated. Chelation and sequestration activities that confer tolerance also drive the uptake of metal ions across the plasma membrane. Synthesis of phytochelatins in S. cerevisiae cells leads to increased tolerance and accumulation of cadmium (20Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). A number of CDFs, e.g. mammalian ZnT-2 and ZAT from Arabidopsis, have been shown to mediate Zn2+tolerance as well as increased accumulation of zinc (14Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 27van der Zaal B.J. Neuteboom L.W. Pinas J.E. Chardonnens A.N. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. Hooykaas P.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, the Zhf-deficient cells were Zn2+-hypersensitive and accumulated less zinc than wild-type cells upon Zn2+ feeding (Figs. 3 and 4). Also, initial Zn2+ uptake rates were only slightly reduced in zhf− cells. Thus, a role in zinc uptake was ruled out, and Zhf was hypothesized to mediate storage of zinc inside the fission yeast cell.The vacuole is generally considered the main storage site for metals in yeast and plant cells. The EDX data (Fig. 3), however, already demonstrated zinc accumulation in zinc-treated wild-type cells outside the vacuoles. This accumulation was not detectable in Zhf-deficient cells. Furthermore, our immunogold labeling data (Fig. 6) indicated localization of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum/nuclear envelope. The tagged protein was functional as shown by complementation, and no specific signal for the vacuolar membrane, any other cellular compartment, or the plasma membrane was detectable. This gives the results a high degree of confidence despite the expression from a plasmid under control of the constitutive nmt1 promoter. No signal was detectable in sections of cells grown in thiamine-containing medium repressing the promoter. However, localization was further supported by the ESI data (Figs. 7 and 8) that indicated that the sites of reduced zinc accumulation in Δzhf cells likely correspond to the ER structures stained by immunogold labeling.These data, as well as another recent study, demonstrate a major role in zinc homeostasis for the endoplasmic reticulum. The reported localization of MSC2, a CDF family member from S. cerevisiae, in the ER/nucleus and the higher nuclear zinc content of msc2− cells suggested a requirement for transporter-facilitated exchange of zinc between cytosol and nucleus at least under certain stress conditions (30Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Zhf is hypothesized to mediate the transport of zinc into the ER and the nuclear envelope in fission yeast. Zhf would thereby contribute to zinc storage and to supplying zinc to zinc-requiring proteins processed in the endoplasmic reticulum. The extreme Zn2+ sensitivity of Δzhf cells demonstrates that Zhf-dependent transport represents a major pathway of zinc storage in S. pombe cells. The fact that Zhf deficiency is not lethal, however, suggests the existence of additional transport systems providing at least the minimum required zinc influx into the ER. This influx may well be too low to result in any accumulation detectable by ESI.Overall accumulation and cytosolic concentrations of available cadmium were found to be also reduced in Zhf-deficient cells. The apparent decrease in sequestrating capacity, however, was not accompanied by an increase in sensitivity, as was observed for instance for the vacuolar membrane-localized transporters ZRC1 in S. cerevisiae (7Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or Hmt1 in S. pombe (31Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In these cases, a transporter residing in an endomembrane detoxifies cadmium and drives the uptake of cadmium. Zhf, however, appears to drive cadmium uptake in a similar fashion yet does not contribute to detoxification. On the contrary,zhf disruption resulted in a dramatic elevation of Cd2+ tolerance. Different hypotheses to explain this surprising observation were assessed. The Cd2+ tolerance phenotype of Δzhf cells might be an indirect result of the effects on zinc content and distribution. However, no evidence for a dependence of this phenotype on the major known cadmium detoxification pathways could be found. Cd2+ ions compete with Zn2+ ions for binding sites in proteins. Higher Zn2+ levels due to the inactivation of a zinc storage mechanism therefore could suppress Cd2+ toxicity. Cytosolic Zn2+ content under control conditions, however, does not appear to be increased in the zhf knock-out strain as indicated by the results of EDX analysis. Is the Cd2+tolerance phenotype then a mere consequence of reduced uptake of Cd2+ into the cells? Zn2+ transporters represent one of the entry pathways for Cd2+ (32Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 33Pence N.S. Larsen P.B. Ebbs S.D. Letham D.L. Lasat M.M. Garvin D.F. Eide D. Kochian L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4956-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). However, no effect of Zhf inactivation on short-term uptake rates of Cd2+ could be detected (Fig. 2 B). Together with the fact that zhf disruption caused a dramatic protective effect in pcs−, cells which are impaired in cytosolic cadmium binding, this led us to hypothesize that Zhf mediates cadmium transport to a particularly sensitive site inside the cell, which based on the protein and zinc localization data would be the endoplasmic reticulum. To find additional evidence as to whether the Cd2+ phenotype is an indirect effect or dependent on a cadmium transport activity of Zhf, we compared complementation of Δzhf cells by the endogenous transporter with complementation by a CDF whose substrate specificity had been studied. Although a number of CDFs studied to date seem to transport Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, and also Ni2+ ions, as most recently shown for Thlaspi transporters (34Persans M.W. Nieman K. Salt D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9995-10000Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis ZAT apparently transports Zn2+ but not Cd2+ (37Bloss T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). When cells were transformed with the respective genes it was observed that both are functionally expressed and complement the Zn2+hypersensitivity of Δzhf cells. In contrast to plasmid-encoded Zhf, ZAT only partially restored the Cd2+sensitivity. This uncoupling of the zinc- and cadmium-related phenotypes suggests that interference with zinc homeostasis is not the cause of the protection against Cd2+. Rather, these data indicate an important insight into the mechanisms of Cd2+toxicity that to date are poorly understood. Displacement of Zn2+ in proteins is one current hypothesis to explain the harmful effects of Cd2+ exposure (35Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). Zhf appears to directly mediate Cd2+ toxicity by transporting Cd2+ ions into the ER and the nuclear envelope, a cellular compartment that apparently is particularly cadmium-sensitive. Cd2+ ions may interfere with the folding of proteins in the ER or more specifically the loading of zinc-requiring proteins with Zn2+ ions. Also, transport of Cd2+ ions into the ER lumen may lead to disturbances in Ca2+ homeostasis as recent evidence suggests a role of Ca2+ ions as a signaling molecule in the ER (36Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The transport dependence of Cd2+ toxicity would also have implications for the efficiency of cytosolic chelation of cadmium by phytochelatins, the main cadmium buffer in many different organisms. The PC detoxification pathway is not sequestering cadmium quantitatively. A fraction is available for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum or other organelles. Hence, Δzhf cells accumulate slightly less cadmium than wild-type cells. In pcs− cells that are impaired in the cytosolic binding of cadmium, this fraction is much larger, which would explain why the zhf disruption results in such an extreme protection against Cd2+ in PC-deficient cells.In conclusion, our data suggest that the transporter Zhf is localized in the ER/nuclear envelope and plays an important role in cellular zinc homeostasis by mediating the transport of zinc into the endoplasmic reticulum. Zhf activity provides a driving force for the accumulation of Zn2+, Co2+, and Cd2+ ions. Zhf-dependent removal from the cytosol results in a protection against Zn2+ and Co2+ toxicity. In contrast, Cd2+ toxicity is enhanced because the transport of cadmium into a particularly cadmium-sensitive organelle is mediated by Zhf. Transport of metal ions across intracellular membranes is a key aspect of metal homeostasis. It provides a driving force for the uptake of metal ions across the plasma membrane and contributes to the trafficking and storage of essential metal ions as well as to the detoxification of non-essential metal ions.

https://openalex.org/W2034526634,"CD40-induced activation of cytokine gene expression in dendritic cells (DC) is an important process in the initiation of primary immune responses. We have determined the intracellular signaling events that lead to CD40 ligation-induced activation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) gene transcription in a murine DC line, FSDC, that is phenotypically representative of bone marrow-derived DC. IL-6 reverse transcriptase-PCR and promoter assays established the responsiveness of FSDC to anti-CD40 ligation. Further promoter assays showed that the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 are downstream transcriptional mediators of CD40-induced IL-6 gene expression. Anti-CD40 treatment of FSDC stimulated increased expression of specific NF-κB (p50:p65) and AP-1 (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, and c-Fos) DNA-protein complexes. Overexpression of an IκB-α super-repressor or a dominant negative JunD resulted in a strong inhibition of CD40-inducible IL-6 promoter activity supporting a role for both transcription factors. Upstream signal transduction events were studied by transfection of wild type and mutant human CD40 expression constructs into FSDC followed by stimulation with an anti-human CD40 antibody. These experiments revealed that anti-CD40 stimulation of NF-κB and IL-6 gene transcription requires specific amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic region of CD40 involved in the recruitment of TRAF2. Induction of IL-6 mRNA by anti-CD40 treatment was found to be a transient event (24 h) and was followed by a diminution of IL-6 transcript to levels below those found in unstimulated cells. This loss of IL-6 expression was associated with reduced p50:p65 NF-κB DNA binding and elevated binding of CBF1 to a site overlapping the NF-κB site. Overexpression of CBF1 resulted in a profound inhibition of basal and anti-CD40-induced IL-6 promoter activities indicating that prolonged induction of CBF1 may contribute to the transient nature of the IL-6 response. The physiological relevance of these molecular events to DC function is discussed.

The powerful immunogenic properties of DCs have implicated these cells in the abrogation of peripheral T cell tolerance against viral, microbial, tumor, and transplant antigens (1.Banchereau J.

Other studies have described the ability of IL-6 to induce IFNγ secretion in differentiating T cells; indeed lack of this response in IL-6 gene knockout mice renders animals unable to mount T cell responses againstMycobacterium. tuberculosis and Toxoplasma gonddi(12.Suzuki Y.

IL-6 can alter the manner in which antigen is processed by DCs enabling the activation of T cells against determinants that were previously cryptic (10.Drakesmith H. O'Neil D. Schneider S.C. Binks M.

Fallarino F. Bianchi R. Belladonna M.L. Vacca C. Orabona C. Uyttenhove C. Fioretti M.C. Puccetti P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that autocrine IL-6 mediates most of the anti-tolerogenic effects of CD40 ligation on CD8+ DC. Aberrant regulation of autocrine and paracrine stimulation of DCs by IL-6 may therefore be important in the generation of anti-self immunity and propagation of autoimmune disease. The signal transduction events leading to the activation of cytokine gene transcription by stimulation of CD40 have mainly been studied in B cells. By contrast little is understood about these events in other cell types, including DCs (2.Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 76: 61-178Crossref Google Scholar). Studies regarding the transcriptional regulation of IL-6 in response to engagement of cell surface CD40 by either CD40L or anti-CD40 have so far revealed a potential role for NF-κB and the requirement for amino acids 202 to 225 in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 (14.Baccam M. Bishop G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These amino acids in combination with other motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 are responsible for the recruitment of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) and several members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) protein family (2.Grammer A.C.

These factors function to link CD40 to the signaling pathways that activate NF-κB, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and STAT3, which in turn stimulate transcription of various CD40-responsive genes. Studies in a variety of cell types have shown that induction of IL-6 gene transcription involves the coordinated regulation of factors that associate with the evolutionary conserved AP-1, NF-κB, and NF-IL-6 sites in the mouse and human IL-6 gene promoters (22.Dendorfer U.

Similar detailed studies on the promoter and transcription factor requirements for stimulation of IL-6 gene transcription following CD40 engagement are currently lacking. Since there is also a general scarcity of information regarding the transcriptional regulation of DC function, we have therefore undertaken a detailed investigation into events at both the IL-6 promoter and the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 that mediate induction of IL-6 mRNA synthesis in response to CD40 engagement. Using the murine DC line FSDC (28.Girolomoni G. Lutz M.B. Pastore S. Aßmann C.U. Cavani A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2163-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we show that anti-CD40 treatment of cells leads to a powerful, but transient induction of IL-6 mRNA expression. We delineate the structural features of the IL-6 promoter required for this response and in addition to demonstrating CD40 induction of AP-1 and NF-κB DNA binding activities we also define a role for specific members of these transcription factor families and their inhibitors in the IL-6 response. Finally, co-transfection of the IL-6 promoter with expression vectors for wild type or mutant human CD40 proteins was employed to map amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail of CD40 that are required for activation of NF-κB and induction of IL-6 mRNA synthesis.

BMDC were obtained by extracting bone marrow from the leg bone of Balb/c mice (Harlan UK, Blackthorn, UK). The cells obtained were washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and plated out onto tissue culture dishes. Cells were grown in complete media supplemented with 5 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (30.Thomson A.W. Lu L. Wan Y. Qian S. Larsen C.P. Starzl T.E. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Media was changed on alternating days for 10 days. Cells were used in studies on day 10 of primary culture. Rat monoclonal antibody 3/23 was raised against mouse CD40 (31.Hasbold J. Johnson-Leger C. Atkins C.J. Clark E.A. Klaus G.G. Eur. J.

All plasmid DNA was prepared using a commercial DNA extraction and isolation kit (Maxiprep, Qiagen). IL-6 promoter function was studied using the luciferase reporter vector pIL6-Luc651, containing nucleotides −651 to +1 of the human IL-6 gene. Construction of pIL6-Luc651 and derivatives carrying site-directed mutations in the AP-1 (−283 to −276), NF-IL6 (−154 to −146), and NF-κB (−72 to −63) sequences have been described elsewhere (26.Eickelberg O.

Wild type human CD40 (hCD40) was amplified from Raji cell line cDNA using h40HindIIIF 5′-ccaagcttcacctcgccatggttcgtctgc-3′ sense and h40XbaIR 5′-gtgggtctagactcactgtctctcctgcac-3′ antisense primer which incorporate HindIII and XbaI restriction enzyme sites to allow for cloning of hCD40 into pcDNA3 expression vector. Human CD40 expression constructs were generated by two-step recombinant PCR using hCD40 wild type as template for hCD40KKV, hCD40T254A, and hCD40T254S whereas both hCD40 and hCD22 (a gift of Professor Martin Glennie, Southampton, UK) expression constructs were used as templates for generation of hCD40/hCD22 chimeric protein. The general method for two-step recombinant PCR was as follows; first step PCR was constructed as two separate reactions. Reaction 1 was set up using h40HindIIIF primer and the appropriate antisense primer for the given mutant as listed in Table I. In all reactions we used 1 μg of hCD40wt/pcDNA3 template, 100 ng of h40HindIIIF primer, and 100 ng of appropriate antisense primer, 2.5 μl of optimized Pfu polymerase buffer (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Reaction 2 was set up in the same manner using h40XbaIR primer and the appropriate sense primer for the given mutant as listed in Table I. In each case both the sense and antisense primers carry the required mutation or a stop codon (as for hCD40KKV). For all first step reactions hCD40wt/pcDNA3 was used as template, except for reaction 2 of hCD40/hCD22 where hCD22 expression construct was used instead. PCR was carried with an initial 5-min incubation at 94 °C. This was followed by 30 cycles of a 1-min annealing step at temperatures outlined in Table I, a 2-min elongation step at 72.0 °C, and a 45-s denaturation step at 94 °C. After 30 cycles a final elongation reaction was carried out for 10 min at 72.0 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis at 80 V for 60 min through a 1% agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Expected sizes of specific PCR products (as in Table I) were verified by reference to a 1-kilobase DNA ladder. PCR products were then excised from agarose gels, purified, and eluted in 20 μl of dH2O. The second step PCR reaction was set up using 10 μl of each of the first step PCR reactions, 2.5 μl of optimized Pfu polymerase buffer (Promega), 0.4 mm dNTP mixture, and 2 units of Pfu polymerase in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. The PCR program was set up as described for first step reactions, with annealing temperature as shown in Table I for each mutant. A total number of 15 cycles was used, followed by addition of h40HindIIIF and h40XbaIR end primers and further 15 PCR cycles. The PCR products were digested withHindIII and XbaI, separated on 1% agarose gel, excised, purified, and ligated into pcDNA3. Presence of the required mutation was confirmed by sequencing.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Harvested cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline prior to lysis in Buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 s at 13,000 rpm to collect crude nuclear pellets. Supernatants were discarded and pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer prior to resuspension in Buffer C supplemented with 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 15 μg/ml aprotinin. After a 10-min incubation on ice with occasional vortexing, the extracts were cleared of insoluble nuclear material by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 s. Cleared nuclear extracts were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes, and their protein content was determined using the Bradford DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). EMSA reactions were assembled on ice and consisted of an initial 10-min incubation of 4 μl of Buffer C containing 2–10 μg of nuclear protein extract and 12 μl of water containing 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). 4 μl of water containing 0.4 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded AP-1 probe was then added to the reaction and, after mixing, was incubated for a further 20 min. For supershift assays, reactions were incubated for a further 16 h in the presence of 2 μg of anti p50/p65 or anti-Jun antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). EMSA and supershift reaction mixtures were then resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (37:5:1). Crude Nonidet P-40 soluble cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by lysis of phosphate-buffered saline-washed cultures in Dignam buffer A supplemented with 0.2% Nonidet P-40.

Following blockade of nonspecific protein binding, nitrocellulose blots were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (diluted in TBS/Tween 20 (0.075%)) containing 3% Marvel and 3% bovine serum albumin. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing JunD, JunB, and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Blots were then washed three times in TBS/Tween 20 prior to incubation for 1 h with sheep anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (1:2000). After extensive washing in TBS/Tween 20 the blots were processed to distilled water for detection of antigen using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). mRNA was extracted from 1 × 107FSDC cells which were either left untreated or were treated with 30 μg/ml anti-mCD40 mAb 3/23 for 24, 48, and 72 h using the “Quickprep micro mRNA Purification kit” (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of mRNA obtained was used to generate first strand cDNA using random hexamer primer (p(dN)6) and “First strand cDNA synthesis system” (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions.

https://openalex.org/W2082528538,"Time courses of translocation of fluorescently conjugated proteins to the plasma membrane were simultaneously measured in thousands of individual rat basophilic leukemia cells. We found that the C2 domain---a calcium-sensing, lipid-binding protein module that is an essential regulator of protein kinase C and numerous other proteins---targeted proteins to the plasma membrane transiently if calcium was released from internal stores, and persistently in response to entry of extracellular calcium across the plasma membrane. The C2 domain translocation time courses of stimulated cells clustered into only two primary modes. Hence, the reversible recruitment of families of signaling proteins from one cellular compartment to another is a rapid bifurcation mechanism for inducing discrete states of cellular signaling networks."

The α2 G-domain modules, mutated in several of these disorders, are thought to mediate different cellular interactions. To analyze these contributions, we expressed recombinant laminin-2 (α2β1γ1) with LG4–5, LG1–3, and LG1–5 modular deletions. Wild-type and LG4–5 deleted-laminins were isolated from medium intact and cleaved within LG3 by a furin-like convertase. Myoblasts adhered predominantly through LG1–3 while α-dystroglycan bound to both LG1–3 and LG4–5. Recombinant laminin stimulated acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering; however, clustering was induced only by the proteolytic processed form, even in the absence of LG4–5. Furthermore, clustering required α6β1 integrin and α-dystroglycan binding activities available on LG1–3, acting in concert with laminin polymerization. The ability of the modified laminins to mediate basement membrane assembly was also evaluated in embryoid bodies where it was found that both LG1–3 and LG4–5, but not processing, were required. In conclusion, there is a division of labor among LG-modules in which (i) LG4–5 is required for basement membrane assembly but not for AChR clustering, and (ii) laminin-induced AChR clustering requires furin cleavage of LG3 as well as α-dystroglycan and α6β1 integrin binding.

Studies on cultured myotubes have revealed that α1- and α2-laminin polymerization and G-domain contributions drive laminin assembly on the cell surface and direct a redistribution of interacting cytoskeletal components (13Colognato H. Winkelmann D.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The ability of laminin to induce such cytoskeletal reorganizations is thought to reflect an important receptor-dependent property of laminin during early steps in assembly of a basement membrane. It has also been shown that laminins can induce the clustering of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), 1The abbreviations used are: AChRacetylcholine receptorNMJneuromuscular junctionLmlamininEBsembryoid bodiesAEBSFaminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluorided-RVKR-cmkdecanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketoneHAhemagglutininPBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate a property shared with agrin (14Sugiyama J.E.

However, while agrin is secreted by terminal neurons and triggers this differentiation in a MuSK-dependent and topographically site-specific manner, the activity of laminins is MuSK-independent and topographically diffuse (8Law P.K.

Laminin's biologically relevant functions are thought to derive from coordinated contributions from different domains of all three subunits (4Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev Dyn. 2000; 218: 213-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). To analyze the LG subdomain dependence of these functions in α2-laminins, we generated recombinant laminins of the subunit composition α2β1γ1 bearing three deletions of the LG modules. These laminins were proteolytically processed in LG-3 by a furin-like convertase, and both unprocessed and processed forms were isolated for study. Using these reagents, we investigated their effects on cultured myotubes and laminin γ1-null embryoid bodies, the latter a model system with which to evaluate basement membrane assembly. We report that laminin-2 binds to cell surfaces, mediates basement membrane assembly, and induces AChR clustering. While all activities depend on LG1–3, AChR clustering requires only LG1–3. Furthermore, furin processing is needed for AChR clustering but not for basement membrane assembly. A 5.5-kb BamHI DNA fragment containing the full-length human β1 cDNA (19Pikkarainen T. Eddy R.

The γ1-chain cDNA (21Pikkarainen T. Kallunki T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6751-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pVL941 was modified to contain a nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG epitope. Laminin γ1 cDNA with a 3′-terminal FLAG sequence was prepared from the pVL941 plasmid by replacing a SacI-SnaBI DNA fragment containing the 3′ end of cDNA with a SacI digested PCR product synthesized using primers 5′-CAACTGTCCTACTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGGCTTTTCAATGGACGG-3′. The second primer contained the 3′ end of γ1 cDNA and FLAG sequence preceded the stop codon. PCR was accomplished with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The 5.5 BamHI DNA fragment from the plasmid was excised, blunted, and ligated into the expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, neo resistance) previously digested with Hin dIII and blunted. A synthetic DNA fragment coding for the HA epitope was inserted following a BM40 signal sequence connected in-frame with the mature α2 cDNA, the last previously joined from two cDNAs coding for the full protein sequence (2Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Sariola H. Engvall E. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 22Ehrig K. Leivo I.

For this purpose a primer 5′-CCCGATATCATGAGGGCCTGGATCTTCTTTCTCCTTTGCCTGGCCGGGAGGGCTCTGGCAGCCCCGCTAGCTTACCCTTACGACGTGCCTGACTACGCCCAGCAAAGAGGTTTATTCCCT-3′ containing an HA-TAG and BM40 (SPARC) signal peptide and 5′ end of α2 cDNA sequences was used together with a second primer 5′-CTGTCCTCCTACTGCTGGG-3′ to synthesize a PCR product with pCIS-α2 plasmid DNA. The DNA fragment obtained was cleaved with EcoRV and BssHII and inserted into pCIS-α2 vector DNA to replace the original 1837-bp EcoRV-BssHII DNA sequence. In the first step, two PCR reactions were carried out with two pairs of primers. One primer (first pair) corresponded to the 5′ end and another primer (second pair) corresponded to the 3′ end of the deletion. At the second step, PCR was carried out with a mixture of the products from the first reactions. The following sets of primers were used for the first pair for: (a) deletion of LG1–5: 5′-CCTCACTGGTCCGCTGCCT-GC-3′ (number 1) with 5′-CCCCTTAATTAATCAGTCACCTCCTGAAGACACAGATACTTTG-3′ and 5′-TGAGGGGCGTTCAACCTGTATCATGC-3′ with 5′-CAAGTTAACGCGGCCGCTC-3′ (number 2); (b) for deletion of LG1–3: number 1 with 5′-GGGCGTAGGAAAGGCTGGGGTGGGAACTGGGTCACCTCCTGAAGACACAGATACTTTG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTCCCACCCCAGCCTTTCCTACGCCC-3′ with number 2; (c) for deletion of LG4–5: number 1 with 5′-GCATGATACAGGTTGAACGCCCCTCACTCAGGCTGGATAACTATTTC-3′ and 5""-TGAGGGGCGTTCAACCTGTATCATGC-3′ with number 2. For all mutations, primers 1 and 2 were used for the second step PCR. The PCR products were then cleaved with Bsp120I and PacI and inserted into pCIS-α2 vector to replace the original Bsp120I-PacI fragment. Transfection of human adenovirus-transformed 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) was carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation as previously described (23Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y.

Samples from conditioned media and cell lysates were screened for recombinant protein using anti-laminin-2/4 antibody. cDNAs coding for the three chains of recombinant laminin-2 (all of human origin) were transfected into 293 cells in a manner similar to that used to generate recombinant laminin-1 (24Yurchenco P.D.

The first step was to transfect and select for stable clones of 293 cells expressing the γ1 chain. The second step was to co-transfect these cells with the α2 and β1 vector constructs and to select for cells stably expressing all three chains under puromycin and G418 selection. Laminin γ1 and β1 chain expression was confirmed in immunoblots with laminin-2/4 and E4 specific antibodies, the latter recognizing epitopes of the N-terminal moiety of the β1 chain. The α2 chain was identified using affinity purified antibodies to whole laminin-2 and laminin-α2G domain (18Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) were grown on feeder layers of mitomycin-treated (100 μg/ml, 2 h) SNL STO cells in ES medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% ES-grade fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg of penicillin/ml, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Invitrogen). To culture EBs, subconfluent ES cells were dispersed with 0.25% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA and plated onto gelatin-coated dishes (3 h) to allow feeder cells to attach. Nonadherent ES aggregates were dispersed and cultured on bacteriological Petri dishes in ES medium without LIF. Following incubation, myotubes were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, blocked in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the same buffer. Following several washes, the cells were incubated with FITC- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and overlaid with DABCO, mounted, and examined with an Olympus IX-70 inverted fluorescent microscope fitted with a Princeton Instruments 5 mHz Micromax cooled CCD camera. Myotube surface coverage by laminins was determined from digitalized images with IPLab version 3.0 (Scanalytics) using segmentation parameters adjusted to detect laminin-covered areas from background. The automatically marked areas were quantitated and the average area and S.E. were determined (n = 6–10 fields). Rat monoclonal anti-laminin γ1 (clone A5; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), rabbit anti-mouse type IV collagen antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilgertville, PA), and rat anti-mouse perlecan monoclonal antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were used for immunostaining of EBs at 1, 2.5, 2 and 2.5 μg/ml, respectively. C2C12 myotubes were incubated for 18 h in the presence of either different concentrations or 10 μg/ml recombinant or other laminins, without or with blocking reagents. Myotubes were then incubated for 1 h with 5 μg/ml FITC-α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) to label clusters of AChR's, washed 4 times with PBS, 1 mm CaCl2 to remove unattached protein, and fixed. Myotubes were incubated with antibody IIH6 (1/10 dilution from conditioned medium), washed, and then treated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 (1:100). Fluorescent micrographs of fixed cells were analyzed in IPLab to determine the number of clusters per field. Only AChR clusters that co-localized with dystroglycan were scored. EBs were collected by gravity sedimentation, washed, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by incubation in 7.5% sucrose-PBS (3 h) and 15% sucrose (4 °C, overnight). Frozen sections were prepared with nonspecific binding sites blocked with 5% goat serum. FITC- and/or Cy5-conjugated antibodies were used as secondary reagents and nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Electron microscopy of thin sections was carried as described (31Tsiper M.V. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We followed a two-step transfection protocol (24Yurchenco P.D. Quan Y. Colognato H. Mathus T. Harrison D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to express recombinant heterotrimeric laminin. 293 cells stably expressing laminin γ1 and selected with the antibiotic G418 were transfected with the β1-expression vector and α2-expression vectors coding for wild-type protein or protein bearing deletions within the LG modules (Fig. 1). Clones expressing protein without epitope tag were generated in parallel with clones expressing γ1 bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag. The latter proved far more successful for the preparation of heterotrimeric laminins and furthermore, permitted purification from serum-containing medium. For the α2 deletion mutants and a wild-type control, a hemagglutinin (HA) tag was placed N-terminal to the mature sequence. Wild-type (WT) recombinant protein and all protein bearing LG module deletions (ΔG1–5, ΔG1–3, and ΔG4–5) were secreted into the culture medium. Heterotrimeric laminin expression was initially detected by the ability of α2 chain and β1 chain-specific antibodies to react with the respective laminin subunits first immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibody (data not shown). The α2 chain bands reacted with both antibodies specific for laminin-2/4 and laminin-α2-G domain and the β1 chain was identified under nonreducing conditions (necessary for antibody reactivity) with E4-specific antibody. For purification (Fig. 2), recombinant laminins in conditioned medium were initially bound to anti-FLAG antibody beads and eluted with FLAG peptide, facilitating subsequent steps by eliminating contaminating serum and secreted proteins. The eluted fraction was bound through its α-subunit to a heparin-5PW column and eluted with a salt gradient (Fig. 2 a). Two wild-type and rLm2-ΔG4–5 protein peaks each were eluted at 0.16 and 0.33 m NaCl, with relative peak sizes varying among different media collections. The different fractions were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2,b–d). The more weakly bound wild-type laminin fraction was found to consist of laminin-2 similar to that obtained from placenta and consisting of a ∼275-kDa (processed, “p”) α2 band (previously designated α2m in Ref. 18Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and ∼75-kDa fragment band (known as a C-terminal moiety) with the β1 and γ1 chains (Fig. 2 b), while the more strongly bound fraction consisted of a larger α2-subunit (α2, unprocessed “u”) with no observed additional α-chain component. It has previously been shown in recombinantly expressed mouse laminin α2-LG1–3 fragment that two closely overlapping furin-type recognition sites exist in the LG3 module with cleavage between Arg-2575 and Gln-2576 generating a blocked N terminus (32Talts J.F. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 33Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We therefore predicted that deletion of LG modules 4 and 5 should leave a smaller cleavable C-terminal fragment of ∼19 kDa plus carbohydrate. A fragment of ∼22 kDa was identified in the low salt, but not the high salt, fractions of rLm2ΔG4–5 (Fig. 2 c), in good agreement with the fragment generated from α2-LG1–3 by Talts et al. (33Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and paralleling the salt-elution behavior seen with wild type recombinant protein. The main α2 band of this high salt fraction appeared to migrate marginally slower than that of the low salt fraction (predicted mass difference is ∼7%). When the FLAG-containing fractions of rLm2-ΔG1–3 and rLm2-ΔG1–5 conditioned media were subjected to heparin-affinity chromatography, each yielded a single low salt-eluting peak detected by reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, a and d). When N-terminal HA-tagged wild-type protein was evaluated (Fig. 2 e), both the more slowly and faster migrating α2 bands were found to possess HA epitope by immunoprecipitation, further supporting the conclusion that the"

Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Many mutations in humanCsx/Nkx2-5 have been reported to cause a variety of congenital heart diseases and atrioventricular conduction delay (4Benson D.W. Silberbach G.M. Kavanaugh M.A. Cottrill C. Zhang Y. Riggs S. Smalls O. Johnson M.C. Watson M.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Plowden J. Kugler J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Schott J.J.

These observations indicate thatCsx/Nkx2-5 plays a critical role in cardiac morphogenesis and contributes to diverse cardiac developmental pathways at the embryonic stage. Knockout experiments have suggested that many genes such asHand1, myocyte enhancer factor-2, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),1 brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac α-actin, cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), N-myc, and MSX2 are genetically located downstream of Csx/Nkx2-5 at the embryonic stage (2Lints T.J.

A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 2Lints T.J. Parsons L.M. Hartley L. Lyons I. Harvey R.P. Development. 1993; 119: 1654-1666Google Scholar), the function ofCsx/Nkx2-5 in the later stage of development is unknown because of embryonic lethality of null mutant mice (3Lyons I. Parsons L.M. Hartley L., Li, R. Andrews J.E. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1654-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 8Tanaka M. Chen Z. Bartunkova S. Yamasaki N. Izumo S. Development. 1999; 126: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our recently generated transgenic mice that overexpress humanCsx/Nkx2-5 (WT-TG mice), mRNA levels of many cardiac genes such as ANP, BNP, CARP, and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) genes were up-regulated (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest thatCsx/Nkx2-5 regulates expression of cardiac-specific genes also in the adult heart. However, because there was no difference in phenotype between WT-TG and non-transgenic (non-TG) mice (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the significance of these gene up-regulations remains unknown. Csx/Nkx2-5 itself is also differentially regulated by different stimuli. In response to hypertrophic stimuli such as isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and pressure overload, Csx/Nkx2-5 is up-regulated (10Thompson J.T. Rackley M.S. O'Brien T.X. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1569-H1573PubMed Google Scholar, 11Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas it is down-regulated by treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) (12Poizat C. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Kloner RA. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8643-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Csx/Nkx2-5 has certain roles in the adult heart. In this study, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress a dominant negative mutant of humanCsx/Nkx2-5 (DN-TG mice) under the control of α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter and examined the role of Csx/Nkx2-5 in the adult heart. Human Csx/Nkx2-5 LPmutant (LP mutant) cDNA created by substituting a proline for a highly conserved leucine in the homeodomain of humanCsx/Nkx2-5 (13Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the α-MHC promoter-containing expression vector (14Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The linearized DNA was injected into pronuclei of eggs from BDF1 mice, and the eggs were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant ICR mice. The transgene was identified by PCR with transgene-specific primers and by Southern blot analysis. Three independent lines of DN-TG mice were obtained, and they showed the same results. We used 12-week-old heterozygous mice for analysis. A single dose of 20 mg/kg DOX was injected intraperitoneally. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after DOX injection. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Chiba. CL6 cells were cultured as described previously (15Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara O.A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To induce differentiation, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added to the growth medium (differentiation medium). The plasmid containing human wild type (WT) Csx/Nkx2-5 orLP mutant was transfected into CL6 cells by the lipofection method (Tfx reagents, Promega) as described previously (15Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara O.A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected with 800 μg of neomycin/ml, and six independent cell lines were isolated. We transfected WTCsx/Nkx2-5 and/or LP mutant into COS-7 cells and cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats by the standard calcium phosphate method. The luciferase activity of the 300-bp ANPpromoter containing the reporter gene was measured 48 h after transfection with a Berthold Lumat LB9501 luminometer as described previously (16Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Akazawa H. Mizukami M. Toko H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35291-35296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Cardiac function was evaluated with echocardiography (Image Point HX, Hewlett Packard) using a 10-MHz transducer as described previously (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Left ventricular (LV) dimension, wall thickness, and percent fractional shortening (%FS) were obtained from M-mode images of the left ventricle. The quantitative measurements represent consensus estimates by two different investigators (H. Toko and E. Takimoto), and interobserver variability was less than 10%. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured by tail cuff method. Four-μm-thick paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson. For the detection of apoptotic cells, TUNEL and immunohistochemical analysis to detect active caspase-3, which is one of the critical enzymes to induce apoptosis, were performed with an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Syuzo) and with anti-active caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Promega), respectively, according to the suppliers' instructions. For electron microscopic analysis, the specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All of the samples were coded and scored in a blind fashion as described previously (17Rahman A. More N. Schein P.S. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1817-1825PubMed Google Scholar). We examined five hearts of each group, and 10 pictures were randomly taken from each heart. Samples were coded and scored independently by two different investigators (H. Toko and M. Sakamoto) using a scale of 0–4 (score 0, normal; score 1, early degenerative alterations in some cells, i.e. loss of parallel orientation, swelling of mitochondria, and cell vesiculation; score 2, advanced degenerative changes, i.e.intracytoplasmic inclusions, loss of myofilaments, separation of intercalated discs, and nuclear modifications; score 3, myofibrillar atrophy and loss of contractile elements; score 4, myofiber degeneration accompanied by myolysis.). Total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidine method (RNAzol B, TEL-TEST), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing Myc-tagged WT Csx/Nkx2-5 andCsx/Nkx2-5 LP, hemagglutinin-tagged WTCsx/Nkx2-5, and GATA-4cDNAs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and 48 h after transfection, whole cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis as described previously (14Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was also performed with anti-Bcl-2 and anti-Fas/ligand monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) as described previously (14Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridizing bands were visualized using an ECL detecting kit (Amersham Biosciences). EMSA was performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the thyroid transcriptional factor-1 (TTF-1) binding sequence as described previously (14Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids expressing Myc-tagged WT Csx/Nkx2-5 andCsx/Nkx2-5 LP cDNAs were transfected into the cultured cardiomyocytes of neonatal rats plated on a cover glass. The cells transfected with LP mutant and WTCsx/Nkx2-5 were marked by anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and an anti-mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine. To detect apoptotic cells, 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture containing both terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dUTP was added to each sample. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Multiple group comparison was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni procedure for comparison of means. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare transgenic with non-transgenic specimens under identical conditions. Values ofp < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Human LPmutant was created by substituting a proline residue for a leucine residue in the homeodomain as described previously (13Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Growset al. (13Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression ofXenopus LP mutant inhibits heart development, suggesting that the LP mutant has dominant inhibitory function. In this study, we further examined the dominant inhibitory function of LP mutant using the ANPpromoter. When co-transfected with ANP promoter containing the luciferase reporter gene into COS-7 cells, the LPmutant did not activate the ANP promoter. However, theLP mutant suppressed WTCsx/Nkx2-5-induced activation of theANP promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). The LP mutant also suppressed the synergistic activation of the ANPpromoter induced by Csx/Nkx2-5 andGATA-4 (Fig. 1 A). EMSA revealed that WT Csx/Nkx2-5, but not the LP mutant, bound to TTF-1 binding sequence, and the TTF-1 binding of WTCsx/Nkx2-5 was mildly but significantly inhibited by the LP mutant (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that a part of the dominant negative effects of the LPmutant is to inhibit the ability of the WTCsx/Nkx2-5 to bind DNA. Our and other groups have demonstrated that Csx/Nkx2-5 may interact withCsx/Nkx2-5 itself andGATA-4 (16Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Akazawa H. Mizukami M. Toko H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4570-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the LP mutant interacted with WTCsx/Nkx2-5 and with GATA-4(Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that the LPmutant suppresses Csx/Nkx2-5-induced activation of the ANP promoter possibly by sequestering associated protein. The CL6 cell line, derived from P19 cells, is a useful in vitro model to study cardiomyocyte differentiation because CL6 cells differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes with high efficiency by treatment with 1% Me2SO (15Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara O.A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To further examine the functions of theLP mutant, we isolated three permanent CL6 cell lines that overexpress WT Csx/Nkx2-5 (CL6-WT), LPmutant (CL6-LP), and the empty vector (CL6-(−)). When cultured in growth medium, all of these cells grew well, and there was no difference in growth rate. When treated with 1% Me2SO, ∼80% of CL6-(−) cells were differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes (positive for MF20) (Fig. 1 D), and the spontaneous beating was first observed on day 10 after the initiation of the Me2SO treatment. In contrast, more than 95% of CL6-WT cells were differentiated into beating cardiac myocytes, and the spontaneous beating was first observed on day 8–9, 1 or 2 days earlier than CL6-(−) (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, CL6-LP cells did not differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes until day 12, and less than 10% of CL6-LP cells were differentiated into MF20-positive beating cardiomyocytes on day 16 (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that overexpression of Csx/Nkx2-5 promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation of CL6 cells and that overexpression of the LP mutant inhibits the cardiomyocyte differentiation. We obtained three independent lines of transgenic mice that overexpressed humanCsx/Nkx2-5 LP mutant under the control of α-MHC promoter (Fig.2 A). The transgene was abundantly expressed in the adult heart, and mRNA levels ofLP mutant were much higher (>10-fold) than those of endogenous Csx/Nkx2-5 (Fig. 2 B). Because the antibody against Csx/Nkx2-5 is not available at present, we estimated the abundance of Csx/Nkx2-5 proteins using EMSA. The band shift was observed when the extracts from the heart of WT-TG mice, but not of DN-TG or non-TG mice, were used (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that exogenous Csx/Nkx2-5 proteins are much higher than endogenous Csx/Nkx2-5. The DN-TG mice were apparently healthy and fertile, and there were no significant differences in body weight, heart weight, and blood pressure among DN-TG mice, non-TG mice, and WT-TG mice (data not shown). In echocardiograms, however, an increase in LV end-systolic dimension and a decrease in %FS was observed in DN-TG mice but not in non-TG or WT-TG mice (Fig. 3). Although there was no significant difference in macroscopic morphology among the three groups, light microscopic analysis revealed that interstitial fibrosis was increased in DN-TG mice compared with non-TG mice and WT-TG mice (Fig.4 A) (percent fibrosis: non-TG mice, 0.75 ± 0.12%; WT-TG mice, 0.42 ± 0.59%; DN-TG mice, 6.71 ± 1.33%; p < 0.01, non-TG miceversus DN-TG mice; p < 0.05, WT-TG miceversus DN-TG mice). In electromicroscopic analysis, a loss of cardiac myofilaments and an increase in the number of mitochondria were observed in the heart of DN-TG mice but not in the hearts of non-TG mice or WT-TG mice (Fig. 4 B). The electron microscopic (EM) scores were higher in DN-TG mice (0.875 ± 0.149) than in non-TG mice (0.062 ± 0.062) and WT-TG mice (0 ± 0) (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that inhibition ofCsx/Nkx2-5 function induces degenerative changes of the adult heart. To highlight the effect of loss of Csx/Nkx2-5 on the adult heart, we injected a cardiotoxic agent, DOX, into these mice. After DOX injection, an enlargement of the LV dimension and a decrease of %FS were observed in non-TG mice and DN-TG mice. Depression of %FS was more prominent in DN-TG mice than in non-TG mice. In WT-TG mice, LV dimension and cardiac function were not significantly changed even after administration of DOX (Fig. 3). Furthermore, although there were no histological changes in all groups of mice after DOX treatment in light microscopic analysis (data not shown), electromicroscopic analysis revealed that DOX induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and myofibrillar loss of cardiomyocytes in both non-TG mice and DN-TG mice, and these ultrastructural changes were more prominent in DN-TG mice than in non-TG mice. In contrast, these ultrastructural changes were barely detectable in the ventricle of WT-TG mice (Fig. 4 B). DOX induced an increase of the EM score in non-TG mice (0.489 ± 0.139) and DN-TG mice (1.270 ± 0.104) but not in WT-TG mice (0.116 ± 0.044), and EM scores were increased more in DN-TG mice than in non-TG mice (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest thatCsx/Nkx2-5 protects the heart from DOX-induced impairment of myocardium. Apoptosis of cardiac myocytes has been reported to be a cause of cardiac dysfunction (19Haunstetter A. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1111-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether DOX induced apoptotic cell death in the hearts of these mice using TUNEL analysis and anti-active caspase-3 antibody. TUNEL- and active caspase-3-positive cardiomyocytes were barely detectable in the heart of all groups of mice without DOX treatment. DOX increased the number of TUNEL- and active caspase-3-positive cells in non-TG mice and DN-TG mice but not in WT-TG mice, and positive cells were more abundant in DN-TG mice than in non-TG mice (Fig.5 A). These results suggest that Csx/Nkx2-5 inhibits DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. To further clarify the protective role ofCsx/Nkx2-5, we transfected the cDNAs of WTCsx/Nkx2-5 and LP mutant into the cultured cardiomyocytes and examined cell death after DOX treatment for 24 h. ∼70% of LP mutant-transfected cells were TUNEL-positive, while only ∼10% of WTCsx/Nkx2-5-transfected cells were TUNEL-positive (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, when differentiated CL6 cell lines were exposed to DOX for 24 h, the number of surviving cells was much lower in CL6-LP than in CL6-(−). In contrast, the number of surviving cells of CL6-WT was more than that of CL6-(−) (Fig.5 C). These results suggest thatCsx/Nkx2-5 also inhibits DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro. We examined expression of cardiac genes such as ANP, BNP, CARP, andSERCA2. As we reported previously, all of these genes were up-regulated in WT-TG mice (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There was no significant difference in mRNA levels of these genes between the DN-TG and non-TG mice (Fig.6 A). We next examined mRNA levels of these genes after DOX injection. mRNA levels were all down-regulated by DOX injection in all of these mice (Fig.6 A). It is noteworthy that the suppressed mRNA levels of all these genes in WT-TG mice were comparable to or still higher than basal mRNA levels of these genes in non-TG mice; however, mRNA levels in DN-TG mice were lower than those in non-TG mice after DOX injection (Fig. 6 A). These results suggest that DOX specifically inhibits the transcription of cardiac genes and thatCsx/Nkx2-5 prevents DOX-induced suppression of gene expression. To get insights into the mechanism by which Csx/Nkx2-5 protects cardiomyocytes from DOX, some death-related proteins were examined after DOX injection using Western blot analysis. There was no significant difference in the basal protein levels of an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, among non-TG, WT-TG, and DN-TG mice. Following DOX injection, Bcl-2 protein levels were increased most markedly in DN-TG mice and moderately in non-TG mice but not changed in WT-TG mice (Fig. 6 B). There was no significant difference in protein levels of Fas/ligand in all of these mice before or after DOX injection (Fig. 6 B). In the present study, we examined the role ofCsx/Nkx2-5 in the adult heart using two transgenic mice that express WT Csx/Nkx2-5 andCsx/Nkx2-5 LP mutant. We obtained the following results: (i) DN-TG mice showed impaired cardiac function and cardiomyocyte degeneration; (ii) DOX induced impairment of cardiac function and loss of myofilaments in DN-TG and non-TG mice, and the degree was more prominent in DN-TG mice than in non-TG mice; and (iii) DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis was enhanced by overexpression ofLP mutant and suppressed by overexpression of WTCsx/Nkx2-5 in vivo and in vitro. It has been reported that LP mutant has dominant negative effects (13Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay revealed that the LP mutant used in our experiments inhibited WTCsx/Nkx2-5-induced activation of theANP promoter in a dose-dependent manner. EMSA revealed that the DNA binding of WT Csx/Nkx2-5was mildly but significantly inhibited by the LP mutant. These results suggest that a part of the dominant negative effects of the LP mutant is to inhibit the ability of the WTCsx/Nkx2-5 to bind DNA. Our and other groups have reported that Csx/Nkx2-5 andGATA-4 display synergistic transactivation of theANP promoter (16Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Akazawa H. Mizukami M. Toko H. Yazaki Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4570-4580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay revealed that theLP mutant inhibited the synergistic activation ofANP by WT Csx/Nkx2-5 andGATA-4, and immunoprecipitation assay showed that the LP mutant interacted with WTCsx/Nkx2-5 and GATA-4. Previous studies indicated that Csx/Nkx2-5 andGATA-4 synergistic action required the interaction of the two factors (16Zhu W. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Akazawa H. Mizukami M. Toko H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35291-35296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Since the LP mutant partially inhibited the DNA binding ofCsx/Nkx2-5, there should be other mechanisms by which the LP mutant inhibits the function of WTCsx/Nkx2-5. A possible mechanism of dominant negative effects of the LP mutant is consumption ofCsx/Nkx2-5-associated proteins includingGATA-4. In Xenopus, injection of RNA of the LP mutant ofCsx/Nkx2-5 suppressed normal heart formation (13Grow M.W. Krieg P.A. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In our present study, the CL6 cells that express theLP mutant did not well differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Following these observations and results, we generated the transgenic mice that overexpress the dominant negative mutant ofCsx/Nkx2-5 to clarify the role ofCsx/Nkx2-5 in the adult heart. Unlike the previous reports showing that Csx/Nkx2-5mutations cause human congenital heart diseases and atrioventricular conduction delay (4Benson D.W. Silberbach G.M. Kavanaugh M.A. Cottrill C. Zhang Y. Riggs S. Smalls O. Johnson M.C. Watson M.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Plowden J. Kugler J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 5Schott J.J. Benson D.W. Basson C.T. Pease W. Silberbach G.M. Moak J.P. Maron B.J. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Science. 1998; 281: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), the DN-TG mice had no congenital heart diseases. The later expression of the LP mutant, which is driven by the α-MHC promoter, may be a cause of the lack of congenital heart diseases and atrioventricular conduction delay in the transgenic mice. DN-TG mice showed impaired contractile function and some histological abnormalities. These results suggest that inhibition ofCsx/Nkx2-5 function impairs the integrity of highly differentiated cardiomyocytes, which may lead to cardiac dysfunction. Injection of Csx/Nkx2-5 mRNA into oocytes of Xenopus and Zebrafish induces enlargement of hearts and ectopic hearts, respectively (20Cleaver O.B. Patterson K.D. Krieg P.A. Development. 1996; 122: 3549-3556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen J.N. Fishman M.C. Development. 1996; 122: 3809-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that transgenic mice that overexpress Csx/Nkx2-5 show up-regulation of some cardiac genes including ANP,BNP, and CARP (9Takimoto E. Mizuno T. Terasaki F. Shimoyama M. Honda H. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Oka T. Hayashi D. Hirai H. Kudoh S. Toko H. Kawamura K. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results suggest thatCsx/Nkx2-5 functions as a transcriptional regulator in adult hearts as well as in embryonic hearts. DOX has been known to have severe cardiotoxic effects. After DOX injection, cardiac function of DN-TG mice was markedly impaired, while WT-TG mice showed only slight impairment of cardiac function. Ultrastructural abnormalities induced by DOX were also more prominent in DN-TG mice than in WT-TG mice. These results indicate thatCsx/Nkx2-5 protects hearts from the cardiotoxic effects of DOX. Because we have previously demonstrated that DOX induces apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes (22Zhu W. Zou Y. Aikawa R. Harada K. Kudoh S. Uozumi H. Hayashi D., Gu, Y. Yamazaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2100-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we further examined cardiomyocyte apoptosis in these mice after DOX injection. TUNEL and immunohistochemical analysis using anti-active caspase-3 antibody revealed that there were more apoptotic cells in the order of DN-TG mice, non-TG mice, and WT-TG mice. The protective function ofCsx/Nkx2-5 against DOX was also observed in cultured cardiomyocytes and CL6-derived cardiomyocytes. Although it remains to be determined whether such a small occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis causes DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction, even a small rate of death might have eventually led to a cause of cardiac dysfunction over a longer time in this study. Several studies have also suggested the interaction of DOX with myofibrillar proteins as an etiology of DOX cardiotoxicity (23Someya A. Akiyama T. Misumi M. Tanaka N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 85: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Lewis W. Gonzalez B. Lab. Investig. 1987; 56: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ito H. Miller S.C. Billingham M.E. Akimoto H.

Similarly, in the present study, the myofibrillar structure was shown to be damaged in a very early stage. DOX induced expression of Bcl-2 in the three kinds of mice with different levels. The different expression levels of Bcl-2 after DOX injection among the three kinds of mice may reflect the different degrees of cardiac impairments, which may be dependent on the different expression of cardiac genes after DOX injection. It has been reported that ANP and BNP are sensitive markers of cardiac impairments induced by DOX (26Chen S. Garami M. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, DOX suppressed the transcription of ANP, BNP, CARP, andSERCA2 in non-TG mice. The inhibition was more prominent in DN-TG mice. In WT-TG mice, although mRNA levels of these genes were also down-regulated, the levels were comparable to or still higher than basal levels of these genes in non-TG mice. A previous study also demonstrated that transcription of cardiac genes is suppressed rapidly and selectively by DOX (25Ito H. Miller S.C. Billingham M.E. Akimoto H. Torti S.V. Wade R. Gahlmann R. Lyons G. Kedes L. Torti F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, the inhibition of gene transcription by DOX has been linked to a reduction of transcription factor MyoD activity (27Kurabayashi M. Jeyaseelan R. Kedes L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6031-6039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the transcriptional repression of many cardiac-specific genes by DOX may be due to the reduced activity of cardiac transcription factors. Recently it has been reported that cardiac transcription factors such asCsx/Nkx2-5, myocyte enhancer factor-2C, anddHAND were down-regulated by exposure of cultured cardiomyocytes to DOX (12Poizat C. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Kloner RA. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8643-8654Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These observations and results suggest thatCsx/Nkx2-5 protects heart from DOX through controlling transcriptional homeostasis of cardiac-specific genes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate whether overexpression ofCsx/Nkx2-5 generally protects the heart from various stresses."

The amazing diversity in RNA function is attributed to the astonishing variety of RNA species and the flexibility in RNA structure. To elucidate the question of how RNA molecules perform their versatile and novel functions, it is crucial to understand the principles and rules that regulate RNA structure. Because of its complexity and versatility, the criterion in RNA folding remains to be elucidated, and determination of RNA structure is an arduous task.

We have predicted that dimerization of RNA might play other vital roles in cell cycles (25Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); for example, RNA/RNA interaction via alternating loops has also been reported for bicoid mRNA in Drosophila embryos (8Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L., St. Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 511-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Ferrandon D. Koch I. Westhof E. Nusslein-Volhard C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We believe that (25Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) the mechanism of bicoid mRNA interaction and translocation might be similar to that of Phi29 pRNA. It is possible that a bicoid mRNA may also form hexameric rings to ride, track, or rotate along Staufen protein during its transportation. Indeed, there is evidence that bicoid mRNA can form dimers and multimers via RNA loop/loop interactions (8Wagner C. Palacios I. Jaeger L., St. Johnston D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Brunel C. J. Mol.

At the time of these studies, very little experimental data regarding the three-dimensional structure of the pRNA monomer, dimer, and hexamers were available. Considering the circumstances in building a pRNA three-dimensional computer model based solely on data from partial secondary structure predictions and computer quantification, the aforementioned computer modeling work was laudable. Recently, the Phi29 DNA packaging motor has become the subject of intense scrutiny (12Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O., He, Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H. Morais M.C. Grimes S. Anderson D.L.

In addition, pRNA dimers are the building blocks in hexamer assembly (13Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and a computer model of pRNA dimers has not been reported. This report describes the three-dimensional structure of the pRNA monomer, dimer, and hexamer using computer modeling and based on experimental data derived from photoaffinity cross-linking, chemical modification, and chemical modification interference, complementary modification, and nuclease probing by RNases. The models presented here integrate experimental data not previously used to make other models. These more realistic models can then be used to aid in understanding the role of pRNA in Phi29 DNA packaging motor. Comparison of the computer models with the published pRNA images of cryo-AFM reveals high similarity in shape. Indeed, docking of the pRNA hexamer model with the connector crystal structure reveals a very impressive match with the biochemical, genetic, and physical data currently available. The construction of pRNAs has been described previously (33Zhang C.L. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of pRNA with AMT (10Chen C.

GMPS containing circularly permuted pRNA (cp-pRNAs) were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmATP, 1 mm CTP, 1 mm UTP, 0.2 mmGTP, [α-32P]GTP, and 8 mm GMPS (AmershamBiosciences) at 37 °C for 4 h (36Garver K.

Transcripts containing the 5′-terminal phosphate of GMPS were coupled to an azidophenacyl group (36Garver K. Guo P. J. Biol.

Under these conditions, no photoagent-independent cross-links were detected (32Mat-Arip Y. Garver K. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32575-32584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of pRNA dimers was achieved by mixing equimolar amounts of photoagent-containing cp-pRNA I-a′ with a transcomplementary pRNA A-i′ in TMS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). The pRNAs were incubated on ice for 15 min and then exposed to UV light. Primer extension was performed to identify the cross-linking sites (36Garver K. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2817-2824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). RNAs were modified with the chemicals dimethyl sulfate (DMS), 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT), and β-etoxy-α-ketobutyraldehyde (kethoxal) as reported previously (9Trottier M.

Virology. 2001; 281: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The concentration of chemicals was titrated empirically to produce, on the average, one base modification per pRNA molecule as described (9Trottier M. Mat-Arip Y. Zhang C. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Zhang C. Trottier M. Chen C. Guo P. Virology. 2001; 281: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Ehresmann C.

Biol. 1986; 187: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Two pRNAs, 5′/3′ B-a′ and 23/97 A-b′, were used to produce pRNA dimers (25Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Mat-Arip Y. Garver K. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32575-32584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RNA 23/97 A-b′ is a 75-base RNA that lacks bases 1–23 and 98–120. This RNA has been shown to be competent in dimer formation (13Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). pRNA 5′/3′ B-a′ was modified by chemicals, and 23/97 A-b′ was not modified. In addition, primers used in reverse transcriptase extension targeted pRNA 5′/3′ B-a′ specifically. This strategy was used to avoid ambiguous primer extension results (32Mat-Arip Y. Garver K. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32575-32584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The monomer RNA B-a′ was treated with either DMS or CMCT as described (9Trottier M. Mat-Arip Y. Zhang C. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Zhang C. Trottier M. Chen C. Guo P. Virology. 2001; 281: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Mat-Arip Y.

After incubation, the reaction mixture was electrophoresed to separate the monomer from dimer. Both the monomer and dimer, after being isolated from the gel, were subjected to primer extension as described (10Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If a modified base is involved in dimer formation, pRNA B-a′ carrying this modified base would not be able to form dimers with A-b′ and thus will be present in the fast migrating band representing the monomer in the gel. The concentration of the modifying chemical was titrated so that on the average only one base of each pRNA was modified. 10–20 ng of32P-labeled pRNA (∼3000 cpm) in 2 μl of H2O was mixed with 6 μl of carrier tRNA (1.75 μg/μl) and dialyzed on a 0.025-μm type VS filter membrane (Millipore Corp.) against TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 15 min. Half of the sample was then transferred into an Eppendorf tube, and the other half was dialyzed further on a VS filter membrane against TMS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min. One μl of T1 ribonuclease (1 unit/μl from the RNA sequencing kit of United States Biochemical) was added to both samples. After 15 min at ambient temperature, the reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.025% xylene, 10 mm EDTA) and loaded onto an 8% sequencing gel. Both T1 ribonuclease and alkaline hydrolysis ladders were generated following the instructions of the RNA sequencing kit (United States Biochemical) (10Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Models of the pRNA monomer, dimer, and hexamer were produced on Silicon Graphics Indigo2 and Octane computers running IRIX version 6.2 or 6.5, using the programs NAHELIX, MANIP, PRENUC, NUCLIN, and NUCMULT (44Massire C. Westhof E. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1998; 16: 197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A Silicon Graphics, Inc. Dials Box attached to the computer was used to provide much of the user input to the MANIP program, including zooming in and out, linear movements, and rotations. Using MANIP, one or more selected nucleotides can be moved, rotated, or torqued in bond angles. Nucleotides can be joined or separated. The modeling was performed based on the following assumptions. 1) Fragments of the molecule were created using the program NAHELIX. All helices are created as a regular A-form double helix, and sequence-dependent distortions of the helix are generally ignored. 2) Internal loops and mismatched bases are constructed by maintaining the integrity of the double helix while optimizing base-pairing and stacking inside the loop, as suggested by other data from crystallography and NMR studies. 3) A general principle for the modeling of RNA hairpin loops has been proposed (46Haasnoot C.A.G. Hilbers C.W. van der Marel G.A. van Broom J.H. Singh U.C. Pattabiraman N. Kollman P.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1986; 3: 843-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), which involves maximal stacking on the 3′ side of the stem and enough nucleotides stacked on the 5′ side to allow loop closure as found in the loop of tRNA anticodon. 4) Bulges are constructed either protruding from stems, so that there is no helical distortion, or within the helical domain, forcing the helical axis to bend. The energies for stacking are considered to decide whether bulges should be protruding from or within the helical stems (47Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Freier S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). 5) Helix untwisting or twisting, helix-helix interactions, triple base interactions (48Michel F. Ellington A.D. Couture S. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 34: 578-580Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), pseudoknots, or other higher order structures have been built into the model at constant geometrical distances but allowing certain torsion angle variation. The principle regarding RNA flexibility has been applied to the construction of the U72U73U74 bulge at the three-helix junction of pRNA. This three-base bulge has been found to provide flexibility for the appropriate folding of the three-helix junction. Traditional computer algorithms involving the minimization of empirical energy functions have been considered. 6) Distances between atoms can be monitored as their positions are changed. 12 angstroms has been considered as a maximum distance constraint when bases are cross-linked by GMPS/aryl azide. Modified distance geometry and molecular mechanics algorithms have been considered to generate structures consistent with data from cross-linking, chemical modification, and chemical modification interference. A constraint satisfaction algorithm provided by the program is used to refine the structure to take care of some poorly defined regions of pRNA in order to ensure a plausible representation of all atoms. PRENUC and NUCLIN create certain files needed for the refinement process to begin. NUCMULT refines the model by changing distances and angles to be closer to standard values. More refinements give the model more standardized dimensions, if the user originally makes the model with distances and angles that do not deviate too much from commonly accepted values. Previous work has identified the intermolecular interaction between the right-hand loop (the loop closest to the 5′ terminus of the pRNA) of one RNA molecule and the left-hand loop (the loop closest to the 3′ terminus of the pRNA) of another pRNA molecule (15Guo P. Zhang C. Chen C. Trottier M. Garver K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 16Zhang F. Lemieux S., Wu, X., St.- Arnaud S. McMurray C.T.

Cell. 1998; 94: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This intermolecular interaction between the loops for the formation of a hexamer is referred to as a “hand-in-hand” interaction (25Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, the pRNA dimer has been shown to be the building block for the formation of the hexameric complex (13Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A model for the pathway of hexamer formation has been proposed (13Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17510-17516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The goal of modeling pRNA is to organize collections of structural data from cross-linking, chemical, or ribonuclease probing, cryo-AFM, and other genetic data into a three-dimensional form. Because a large number of structural constraints are available, computer programs can successfully construct three-dimensional structures. Computer models of the pRNA monomer, dimer, and hexamer and the hexamer-connector complex are presented (Fig. 2, A–D, respectively). The pRNA molecule contains five primary regions (Fig. 1A). The first region is the 5′/3′ helix that includes bases 1–28 and 92–117. The second region is the left-hand stem loop incorporating bases 75–91. The third region is made of bases 40–44 and the right-hand loop, composed of bases 45–48. The fourth region is the head-stem loop made of bases 49–62. Bases 30–39 and 71–63 comprise the fifth region, which is the helix between the three-helix junction point and the right-hand loop. Hand-in-hand base-pairing among six monomers forms a hexamer bound to a Phi29 procapsid. The justification for the modeling is described below. Complementary modification was used to confirm the presence of helical regions within the pRNA secondary structure (49Zhang C.L. Tellinghuisen T. Guo P. RNA. 1995; 1: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar, 50Zhang C.L. Tellinghuisen T. Guo P. RNA. 1997; 3: 315-322PubMed Google Scholar, 51Reid R.J.D. Zhang F. Benson S. Anderson D. J. Biol.

An extensive series of helix disruptions by base substitutions virtually always resulted in the loss of DNA packaging activity. The inactive pRNAs in this category include pRNA FW/4, pRNA 14–16/10 and 7/101–103, 7/29 and 28/21, and pRNA F3 (Fig. 3). Additional mutations that restored the predicted base-pairing rescued pRNA activity; for example, pRNA FW/RV, pRNA 14–16/101–103, pRNA 28/29, and pRNA F3/A5, with compensatory mutations are all active in Phi29 DNA packaging. The secondary site suppression confirmed that these regions indeed are helical. The computer model of the pRNA monomer supports these data by showing that bases 1 and 2 are paired with bases 117 and 116; bases 7–9 are paired with bases 112–110; bases 14–16 are paired with bases 103–101; and bases 76–78 are paired with bases 90–88. The complementary modification data was incorporated into the three-dimensional monomer model (Fig. 4).Figure 4Computer model of pRNA monomer to illustrate the results of complementary modification. Bases mutated in the complementary modification studies are shown in space-filled mode in the three-dimensional model. If the secondary site complementary mutation could restore the pRNA activity, these bases are presented as a helical stretch. The model shows that bases 1 and 2 are paired with bases 117 and 116, bases 7–9 are paired with 112–110, bases 14–16 are paired with 103–101, and bases 76–78 are paired with 90–88.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Psoralen is a photoactive probe for pRNA structure (10Chen C.

In these studies, the C-terminal tail of the CI-MPR bound to the VHS domains of the GGAs with higher affinity than did the corresponding region of the CD-MPR (10Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 13Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28541-28545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). There also was a difference in the relative affinity of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail for the VHS domains of the different GGAs. Puertollano et al. (10Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) showed that the CD-MPR bound well to the VHS domain of GGA1, but only poorly to that of GGA3, and not at all to GGA2. In contrast, they found that the cytoplasmic tail of the CI-MPR bound to the VHS domains of all three GGAs with about equal affinity. Takatsu et al. (13Takatsu H. Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28541-28545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) on the other hand found that the cytoplasmic tail of the CI-MPR but not the CD-MPR interacted with the VHS domain of GGA1. In the present study we have examined the basis for the differences in binding of the two MPRs to the GGAs. GST fusion peptides were generated with various single and double amino acid substitutions of the CD-MPR C-terminal region to more closely mimic the sequence of the CI-MPR C-terminal peptide. The ability of these GST peptides to bind to GGAs1–3 was measured in GST pull-down assays. These experiments have identified several residues that significantly increase binding to the VHS domains of the GGAs. Cell lines stably transfected with the CD-MPR mutants that have improved GGA binding exhibit increased efficiency of cathepsin D sorting. This is consistent with the idea that lysosomal sorting at the TGN requires the direct participation of GGAs. The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-HA monoclonal was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Anti-bovine CD-MPR polyclonal antibody and anti-human cathepsin D polyclonal antibody were generated in this laboratory. The construct for the GST fusion encoding the wild-type bovine CI-MPR 163-amino acid cytoplasmic tail was made by PCR and ligation into the vector pGEX6P-1 (AmershamBiosciences) as described (11Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Residues 1–145 of the CI-MPR tail were subsequently deleted out by designing primers and using the QuickChangeTM system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate a GST CI-MPR peptide fusion incorporating only the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. The GST CD-MPR peptide construct was generated by annealing sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the bovine CD-MPR cDNA and ligating the double-stranded products into EcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX-5X-3 (AmershamBiosciences). Mutagenesis of the CI- and CD-MPR cytoplasmic tails was performed using primers incorporating the desired mutations with the QuickChange system. myc-GGA1pCR3.1 and GGA3pCR3.1 were generous gifts from Juan Bonifacino (National Institutes of Health). GGA2-HApRK5 was kindly provided by Veli-Pekka Lehto (University of Oulu). To construct myc-GGA1 and GGA2-HA in the pFB1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for expression in SF9 insect cells, myc-GGA1pCR3.1 and GGA2-HApRK5 were double-digested with BamHI/NotI, and the cDNA inserts were ligated with BamHI/NotI-digested pFB1 to generate myc-GGA1pFB1 and GGA2-HApFB1. myc-GGA3pFB1 was constructed in two steps as follows. A SalI restriction site was engineered into myc-GGA1pFB1 by substituting the codons for Leu-10 and Glu-11 of the GGA1 cDNA by the QuickChange method. Similarly, a SalI site was engineered into GGA3pCR3.1 by substituting the codons for Glu-7 and Ser-8 of the GGA3 cDNA. myc-GGA3pFB1 was subsequently constructed by substituting the SalI/NotI fragment of myc-GGA1pFB1 encoding the GGA1 cDNA with the corresponding SalI/NotI fragment encoding the GGA3 cDNA. The various truncation mutants were generated using primers incorporating a stop codon at the desired position with the QuickChange system. Mutations in full-length CD-MPR were introduced into the cDNA subcloned in the vector pBillNeo (15Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 10010-10014Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) by the QuickChange method using oligonucleotide pairs incorporating the desired mutations. All constructs and mutations were confirmed to be correct by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The various GST CI- and CD-MPR fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(RIL) (Stratagene) essentially as described (16Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells from 1 liter of culture were lysed into 20 ml of CellLytic B reagent (Sigma), sonicated briefly, and centrifuged at 27,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The clarified lysate was then mixed by tumbling at 4 °C for 4 h with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Following 4 washes with the 20 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer and a single wash with detergent-free 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 8.0, the GST fusion proteins were competitively eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mmTris·Cl, pH 8.0. Proteins eluted with reduced glutathione were dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline before use in pull-down experiments. myc-GGA1pFB1, GGA2-HApFB1, and myc-GGA3pFB1 were transformed into E. coli DH10Bac competent cells to generate recombinant bacmids as per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Bacmid DNAs were transfected into SF9 insect cells to produce recombinant baculoviruses that were amplified and used to express the various GGAs in the insect cells. Insect cells expressing the GGA proteins were routinely harvested 48 h post-infection, lysed into cold buffer A (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.4% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) by sonication, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the GGA protein was stored at −80 °C for use in the binding assays. The binding of the various GST fusions with the GGA proteins was assayed in buffer B (buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100) in a final volume of 300 μl in 1.5-ml pre-siliconized microcentrifuge tubes (Midwest Scientific, Valley Park, MO). Routinely, the GST fusion proteins were first immobilized at room temperature on 30 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose to concentrations of 3–6 mg/ml. The beads with bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 750 × g for 1 min and the beads washed once with cold buffer B, and 300 μl of the SF9 cell lysate in buffer A at a final concentration of 2–5 mg/ml was added to the washed beads. To determine binding to AP-1, 300 μl of bovine adrenal cytosol (8 mg/ml) in buffer B was added to the washed beads. The binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 3 h at 4 °C with tumbling, following which the samples were subjected to centrifugation at 750 × g for 1 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was saved, and the pellets were washed four times each by resuspension in 1 ml of cold buffer B by centrifugation at 750 × g. The washed pellets were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Unless indicated otherwise, 1% of each pellet and supernatant fraction was loaded on SDS gels. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then probed with primary antibodies as indicated in the individual figure legends, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The immunoreactive bands were visualized on x-ray films using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Stable cell lines expressing the various CD-MPR mutants were generated by transfection of the pBillNeo constructs into CI-MPR negative mouse L cells (D-9) and the subsequent selection of clones propagated in G418-containing media. Transgene protein expression was determined by Western blotting. The CD-MPR protein levels of the various cell lines were compared with the non-transfected D-9 cells by loading equal quantities of total protein from cell lysates on SDS gels, transferring to nitrocellulose, and quantifying the immunoreactive bands by ECL using the Kodak Digital Imaging System (Eastman Kodak Co.). Metabolic labeling and sorting of cathepsin D by the various CD-MPR mutant cell lines were performed essentially as described (17Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse L cells were plated onto 6-well plates 2 days prior to labeling. Cell monolayers at ∼90% confluency were washed twice with cysteine/methionine-free α-minimum Eagle's medium and labeled for 1 h with 1 ml of 1 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine, CA) in the presence of 20 mm Hepes and 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate. Excess unlabeled methionine (10 mm final concentration) was added to initiate a 4-h chase. Cells were then placed on ice and processed as described (18Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The amount of cathepsin D sorted was determined by immunoprecipitating equivalent aliquots of the lysed cell and media high speed supernatants overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human cathepsin D antiserum and protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen, Cambridge, MA). After four washes, immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. Gels were treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. The resultant autoradiogram was used as a template to excise from the gel the regions corresponding to the processed and secreted forms of cathepsin D. The gel slices were then processed, and the associated radioactivity was determined as described (17Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of cathepsin D sorted was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity in the processed form to the sum of the processed and secreted forms. Although both the CD-MPR and the CI-MPR contain acidic cluster-dileucine sequences near the C terminus of their cytoplasmic tails, inspection of the amino acid sequences of the bovine species shows several differences in this region as well as in the flanking residues (Fig. 1). Setting the first leucine of the dileucine motif to 0, there are differences at positions −1, −4, −7, and −8 and at +2 and +3. To evaluate the importance of these differences in binding to the various GGAs, GST fusion peptides incorporating the C-terminal 18 amino acids of the receptors were generated with single or double substitutions of the CI-MPR residues into the equivalent position of the CD-MPR peptide backbone. The ability of these various mutant GST peptides to bind GGAs in pull-down assays was then compared with binding by the wild-type CI-MPR and CD-MPR peptides. In preliminary experiments, we found that the GST peptides with the wild-type MPR sequences bound GGAs to the same extent as the GST full-length cytoplasmic tails. Fig. 2 A shows that GGA2 binds much better to the wild-type CI-MPR peptide than to the wild-type CD-MPR peptide, confirming the previous report (10Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of 1% of the GST CI-MPR peptide pellet gave a signal equivalent to that seen with 25% of the GST CD-MPR pellet. Mutation of the His residue at position −1 of the CD-MPR sequence to Asp resulted in a striking increase in GGA2 binding, equivalent to that seen with the CI-MPR peptide. Mutation of the Arg residue to a Ser at position −4 of the CD-MPR sequence greatly enhanced GGA2 binding as well, although not quite to the same extent as the His to Asp substitution. When the Glu and Ser flanking residues at positions −8 and 7 were changed to Phe and His, respectively, there was no significant alteration in GGA2 binding, indicating that these residues do not have a role in the interaction with GGA2. In contrast, the residues downstream of the dileucines strongly affect GGA2 binding. Thus substitution of the Pro and Met residues at positions +2 and 3 with alanines resulted in GGA2 binding equal to that observed with the CI-MPR peptide. This result is similar to that reported by Puertollano et al. (10Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) with GGA3 using the yeast two-hybrid assay. The same results were obtained when the binding of GGA1 and GGA3 to the various peptides was tested (Fig. 2, B–D). In both cases the CI-MPR peptide bound the GGAs much better than the CD-MPR peptide, and the His → Asp, Arg → Ser, and Pro → Ala/Met → Ala substitutions enhanced binding, whereas the Glu → Phe/Ser → His mutation had no detectable effect on binding.Figure 2Effect of mutations in the CD-MPR tail on GGA binding. A–D, specific mutations of the C-terminal amino acid residues of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail to the corresponding residues in the CI-MPR tail greatly enhance binding to all three GGA VHS domains in GST pull-down experiments. 1% of the pellet (P) and supernatant (S) were resolved on 10% SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with either the anti-Myc or anti-HA antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” *, highlights the fact that the GST CD-MPR peptide does bind to the VHS domain albeit very weakly relative to the GST CI-MPR peptide, 25% of pellet and 5% of supernatant were loaded in this case.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding that the Pro → Ala/Met → Ala substitution enhanced GGA binding indicated that one or both of these residues was inhibitory. To pursue this point, GST peptides were prepared in which the Pro and Met residues were individually mutated to alanines. When these were tested for binding to the GGA1 VHS domain, the peptide with the Met → Ala mutation exhibited a striking increase in GGA1 binding, whereas the peptide with the Pro → Ala substitution behaved similar to the wild-type CD-MPR peptide (Fig. 2 D). This demonstrates that the C-terminal Met completely accounts for the inhibitory effect. Because the C-terminal residue in the bovine CI-MPR is a valine, we asked whether substitution of this bulky hydrophobic residue with a methionine would influence GGA binding. As shown in Fig. 3, a GST CI-MPR peptide with the Val to Met substitution bound GGA1 and GGA2 poorly when compared with the wild-type peptide, supporting the interpretation that a Met at the +3 position inhibits binding to the GGAs. The acidic cluster/dileucine motifs of both MPRs are located two residues from the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 1). In sortilin, another membrane receptor known to interact with the GGAs, the acidic cluster cluster/dileucine motif is one residue from the carboxyl end (12Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This prompted us to ask whether the positioning of the acidic cluster-dileucine motif relative to the C terminus of the protein influences binding to the GGAs. To explore this issue we constructed GST CI-MPR and CD-MPR peptides with four alanine residues extending beyond the usual C-terminal residue. The CD-MPR peptide also contained the Pro → Ala/Met → Ala substitution so that GGA binding could be more easily detected. As shown in Fig. 4, the addition of the four alanines strikingly inhibited binding to all three GGAs. These findings indicate that the position of the acidic cluster-dileucine motif relative to the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail has a major effect on GGA binding. In a previous study (17Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) published before the discovery of the GGAs, we reported that CI-MPR-negative mouse L cells expressing CD-MPR with the Pro → Ala/Met → Ala mutation sorted the acid hydrolase cathepsin D more efficiently than cells expressing greater amounts of wild-type CD-MPR. The current findings suggest that the improved sorting efficiency may have been the result of enhanced binding to the GGAs. To determine whether this correlation holds for the other mutations that increase GGA binding, CI-MPR-negative L cells (clone D-9) were stably transfected with plasmids encoding bovine CD-MPRs with either Arg → Ser, His → Asp, or Glu → Phe/Ser → His substitutions. The ability of these cells to sort cathepsin D in pulse/chase experiments was measured and compared with cells expressing wild-type CD-MPR or CD-MPR with the Pro → Ala/Met → Ala mutation. The results are summarized in Table I. The non-transfected D-9 cells sorted 44 ± 3% of the cathepsin D due to the endogenous CD-MPR. The sorting efficiency increased to 69 ± 4% in cells expressing 12-fold more wild-type CD-MPR but was essentially unchanged in a cell line expressing only 4-fold more wild-type CD-MPR. Cells expressing CD-MPR with the Glu → Phe/Ser → His mutation sorted 53 ± 2% of cathepsin D, which is not significantly different from the non-transfected D-9 cells. This mutation does not enhance GGA binding. In contrast, cells expressing CD-MPR with either the Arg → Ser or the His → Asp mutations exhibited a significant increase in cathepsin D sorting (57 ± 2 and 70 ± 4%, respectively) even though the receptor expression level was only two times the basal level. Both of these mutations increase GGA binding with the His → Asp substitution having a greater effect than the Arg → Ser substitution. The cells expressing receptor with the Pro → Ala/Met → Ala mutation sorted cathepsin D very efficiently (84 ± 1%), confirming our previous findings. The expression level of this mutant receptor was 4.5-fold the basal level, which may explain why it is more effective than the His → Asp and Arg → Ser mutants. Taken as a whole, these data reveal a strong correlation between GGA binding and the efficiency of cathepsin D sorting in cells.Table ISorting of cathepsin D by L cells expressing mutant CD-MPRsConstruct transfectedCD-MPR expression1-aLevels of CD-MPR expression in the transfected cell lines are expressed relative to the non-transfected mouse D-9 cells.% cathepsin D sorted1-bCathepsin D sorting results are expressed as mean ± S.E.; the range of values is given in the parentheses, and n is the number of determinations.p value1-cp values are obtained with statistical analysis comparing individually the whole sets of values of the mutations to the values of D-9.None (clone D-9)1.044 ± 3 (30–60, n = 10)Wild-type (clone ML4) ⋯ESEERDDHLLPM1269 ± 4 (50–83,n = 7)<0.001Wild-type (clone ML5)4.045 ± 5 (28–63, n = 6)>0.1Glu → Phe/Ser → His4.053 ± 2 (49–59, n = 4)>0.1His → Asp2.070 ± 4 (44–85, n = 9)<0.001Pro → Ala/Met → Ala4.584 ± 1 (79–86,n = 5)<0.001Arg → Ser2.057 ± 2 (50–63, n = 4)<0.051-a Levels of CD-MPR expression in the transfected cell lines are expressed relative to the non-transfected mouse D-9 cells.1-b Cathepsin D sorting results are expressed as mean ± S.E.; the range of values is given in the parentheses, and n is the number of determinations.1-c p values are obtained with statistical analysis comparing individually the whole sets of values of the mutations to the values of D-9. Open table in a new tab Another potential explanation for the improved ability of the mutant receptors to sort cathepsin D is that the amino acid substitutions enhance binding to the AP-1 adaptor protein complex that is also implicated in packaging the MPRs into transport vesicles in the TGN (19Mauxion F. Leborgne R. Munierlehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The various GST fusion peptides were therefore tested for their ability to bind AP-1 in pull-down assays. As shown in Fig. 5, the full-length CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail bound only a trace amount of AP-1 in this assay compared with strong binding by the CI-MPR full-length cytoplasmic tail. None of the GST peptides having wild-type or mutant acidic cluster-dileucine sequences bound detectable levels of AP-1. This indicates that the AP-1 binding to the full-length CI-MPR cytoplasmic tail observed in this assay is not mediated by the acidic cluster-dileucine motif, in agreement with our previous study (11Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it suggests that the improved efficiency of cathepsin D sorting exhibited by three of the CD-MPR mutants is not a consequence of enhanced binding to AP-1. The results presented in this study provide a number of new insights concerning the interaction of the GGAs with acidic cluster-dileucine motifs. First, our data show that the weak binding of the CD-MPR to the GGAs relative to that observed with the CI-MPR is due to two amino acid differences in the acidic clusters of these receptors along with a difference in the C-terminal residue located two residues downstream of the dileucines. Within the acidic clusters, we found that an Asp residue at the −1 position greatly enhanced GGA binding compared with a His at this position. This is consistent with our previous study (11Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) showing that multiple residues in the acidic cluster of the CI-MPR influence binding to GGA2. A Ser at position −4 also improved GGA binding relative to an Arg at that position. In both instances the favorable residue is present in the acidic cluster of the CI-MPR, whereas the unfavorable residue is found in the CD-MPR acidic cluster. The other key observation is that a Met at the C-terminal position, as occurs in the CD-MPR, inhibits GGA binding, whereas a Val at that position, as found in the bovine CI-MPR, allows strong binding. This finding is significant because it indicates that the GGAs recognize the C-terminal residue as well as the acidic cluster-dileucine motif. Furthermore, because the addition of four alanines to the C-terminal residue strongly inhibited GGA binding, it appears that the location of the acidic cluster-dileucine motif two residues upstream from the C terminus is critical for optimal binding to the GGAs. The effects of these residues on binding was found with all three GGAs, demonstrating that the different GGAs recognize common elements in the acidic cluster-dileucine motifs. While this manuscript was in preparation, two groups (20Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Shiba T.

Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of the VHS domains of human GGA1 and GGA3 complexed with the acidic cluster-dileucine motifs of the MPRs. The VHS domain is a right-handed superhelix of eight helices. Helices 6 and 8 form a surface that makes extensive contacts with amino acid residues −5 to +3 of the CI-MPR cytoplasmic tail and residues −4 to +3 of the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail. Among these residues, the dileucines and the aspartate at position −3 have the most extensive interactions with the VHS-binding site, whereas the other residues appear to contribute to a lesser extent to the binding. These authors also implicated the C-terminal flanking residues of the acidic cluster-dileucine motifs in the binding to the VHS domain. They noted that the C-terminal side-chain protrudes into a hydrophobic pocket. Furthermore, Misra et al. (20Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) found that MPR sequences with two residues distal to the dileucines gave optimal binding, whereas those with one or three bound more weakly, and those with zero or four did not bind. Peptides containing amidated C-terminal residues also bound very weakly. Thus binding to the VHS domains requires a precise spacing between the dileucines and the free C terminus. Finally, Misra et al. (20Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reported that the CI-MPR peptide bound 4–6-fold better to the VHS domains of GGA1 and GGA3 than the CD-MPR peptide as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. These findings are in good agreement with our results. Our data extend the work of Misra et al. (20Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Shiba et al. (21Shiba T. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Kawasaki M. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Earnest T. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) by identifying the residues that account for the differences in CI-MPR and CD-MPR binding to the VHS domains. The second important finding in our study is the strong correlation between the apparent binding affinities of the various acidic cluster-dileucine motifs to GGAs1–3 in the in vitro pull-down assays and the efficiency of cathepsin D sorting in mouse L cells expressing CD-MPRs with the different mutations. These data provide evidence that GGAs play a key role in packaging CD-MPRs with bound acid hydrolases into transport vesicles that are delivered to the endosome/lysosome system. A similar correlation emerged from studies of CI-MPRs that have a variety of mutations in their acidic cluster-dileucine motifs (11Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S.

None of the mutations in the CD-MPR acidic cluster-dileucine motif that enhanced GGA binding resulted in AP-1 binding as measured by the pull-down assays. In fact, the full-length CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail bound AP-1 very poorly in this assay in contrast to the findings with the CI-MPR cytoplasmic tail. This probably reflects the insensitivity of the assay because Honing and co-workers (25Honing S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported that the cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR binds AP-1 with high affinity. These investigators used surface plasmon resonance to identify two independent sequences (amino acids 34–43 and 49–67) that bind AP-1 with Kd values of 14 nm. Whereas the 49–67 sequence includes the acidic cluster-dileucine motif, they showed that mutation of the dileucines to alanines had no effect on AP-1 binding. This is significant because mutation of the dileucines abolishes GGA binding, and cells expressing CD-MPRs with this mutation exhibit extremely poor cathepsin D sorting (17Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Denzer K. Weber B. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus although AP-1 may have a role in packaging the CD-MPR into clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN, either it handles only a small fraction of the cargo relative to the GGAs or it relies on the GGAs to present the MPRs for incorporation into AP-1 transport vesicles. Our data do not distinguish between these possibilities. Finally, it is curious that the CD-MPR, in contrast to the CI-MPR, would evolve with an acidic cluster-dileucine motif that fails to provide optimal interaction with the GGAs. The CD-MPR does function to sort acid hydrolases in cells, so perhaps it works sufficiently well so that pressure has not been exerted to evolve into a more efficient receptor. Alternatively, the CD-MPR may be subject to some type of regulation that modulates GGA interaction. The cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR contains a casein kinase II phosphorylation site just upstream of the acidic cluster-dileucine motif (the Ser is at position −7, see Fig. 1). The importance of phosphorylation of Ser-57 is not clear at this time. Mauxion et al. (19Mauxion F. Leborgne R. Munierlehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have suggested that phosphorylation of this serine facilitates AP-1 recruitment to the TGN. On the other hand, substitution of Ser-57 with an alanine or aspartate did not influence acid hydrolase sorting in mouse cells (17Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Breuer P. Korner C. Boker C. Herzog A. Pohlmann R. Braulke T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It may turn out that phosphorylation of Ser-57 regulates binding to the GGAs under some circumstances. We thank Rosalind Kornfeld for reading of the manuscript and helpful comments."

Using a combined analysis of four protocols of inversion magnetization transfer associated with biochemical data, three different creatine kinase (CK) activities were resolved in the rat heart perfused in isovolumic control conditions: (i) a cytosolic CK functioning at equilibrium (forward, Ff = PCr → ATP, and reverse flux,Fr = ATP → PCr = 3.3 mm·s−1), (ii) a CK localized in the vicinity of ATPases (MM-CK bound isoform) favoring ATP synthesis (Ff = 1.7 × Fr), and (iii) a mitochondrial CK displaced toward PCr synthesis (Ff = 0.3 and Fr = 2.6 mm·s−1). This study thus provides the first experimental evidence that the energy is carried from mitochondria to ATPases by PCr (i.e. CK shuttle) in the whole heart. In contrast, a single CK functioning at equilibrium was sufficient to describe the data when ATP synthesis was partly inhibited by cyanide (0.15 mm). In this case, ATP was directly transferred from mitochondria to cytosol suggesting that cardiac activity modified energy transfer pathways.

Two major roles have been attributed to the creatine kinase (CK, 1The abbreviations used are: CKcreatine kinaseANTadenine nucleotide translocatorATP1cytosolic ATPATP2mitochondrial ATPATP3ATP in the vicinity of the ATP-consuming sitesc.i.confidence intervalCrcreatinecyto-CKcytosolic CKEDPend diastolic pressureFfforward CK flux, unidirectional flux of ATP synthesis by CKFrreverse flux, unidirectional flux of PCr synthesis by CKi.m.s.intermembrane space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membraneinv- (inv-PCr or inv-ATP)inversion (of PCr or of γ-ATP), protocol of magnetization transfer experimentLVPleft ventricular systolic pressuremin-χ2minimal χ2, estimation of the quality of the adjustmentmito-CKmitochondrial CK isoformMM-bound CKMM creatine kinase isoform localized in the vicinity of ATP-consuming sitesPCrphosphocreatineQO2cardiac oxygen consumptionRPPrate pressure product (estimation of contractility)satPicontinuous saturation of inorganic phosphate resonanceSLsarcolemmaSRsarcoplasmic reticulumT1xspin lattice relaxation time of species x 1The abbreviations used are: CKcreatine kinaseANTadenine nucleotide translocatorATP1cytosolic ATPATP2mitochondrial ATPATP3ATP in the vicinity of the ATP-consuming sitesc.i.confidence intervalCrcreatinecyto-CKcytosolic CKEDPend diastolic pressureFfforward CK flux, unidirectional flux of ATP synthesis by CKFrreverse flux, unidirectional flux of PCr synthesis by CKi.m.s.intermembrane space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membraneinv- (inv-PCr or inv-ATP)inversion (of PCr or of γ-ATP), protocol of magnetization transfer experimentLVPleft ventricular systolic pressuremin-χ2minimal χ2, estimation of the quality of the adjustmentmito-CKmitochondrial CK isoformMM-bound CKMM creatine kinase isoform localized in the vicinity of ATP-consuming sitesPCrphosphocreatineQO2cardiac oxygen consumptionRPPrate pressure product (estimation of contractility)satPicontinuous saturation of inorganic phosphate resonanceSLsarcolemmaSRsarcoplasmic reticulumT1xspin lattice relaxation time of species x adenosine triphosphate creatine phosphotransferase, E.C. 2.7.3.2) reaction, which catalyzes the reversible exchange of high energy phosphate: PCr2−+MgADP−+H+ ⇄FrFf Cr+MgATP2−Equation 1 Due to its equilibrium constant favoring ATP synthesis, CK acts as a spatial and temporal buffer for ATP. In addition, due to specific intracellular localization, CK has been suggested to play a key role in energy transfer from sites of ATP production to ATPases by a phosphocreatine (PCr)-creatine (Cr)-CK shuttle. In the myocardial cell, half of the total CK activity is present in the cytosol (cyto-CK), and the other half is accounted for by MM and mitochondrial (mito-CK) isoforms located in the vicinity of other enzymes: a particulate MM-bound CK located in close vicinity to the ATPases of myofibrils, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and sarcolemma (SL) and a mito-CK isoform that is close to the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the intermembrane space (i.m.s.) of mitochondria. The vicinity of CK with other enzymes was shown to influence enzyme kinetics both in vitro (1Sata M. Sugiura S. Yamashita H. Momomura S. Serizawa T. Circulation. 1996; 93: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Arrio-Dupont M. Bechet J.J. D'Albis A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 951-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in skinned fiber preparations (3Saks V.A. Kuznetsov A.V. Kupryianov V.V. Micelli M.V. Jacobus W.E. J. Biol.

Mito-CK is the most obvious example of an exclusive localization in the restricted i.m.s. of the mitochondria where mito-CK octamers and their vicinity to ANT and porin have been proposed to efficiently channel energy from the mitochondria to cytosol (5Saks V.A.

Biochim. Acta. 1992; 1102: 119-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The functional consequence of this localization was first evidenced in vitro where the activity of mito-CK changes the apparent affinity of respiration for externally added ADP in isolated mitochondria and saponin-skinned fibers (7Moreadith R.W.

Although there is no physical membrane to restrict MM-CK isozyme in myofibrils, SR, or SL, the localization and activity of MM-CK modifies the kinetics of the myofibrillar ATPases (4Ventura-Clapier R.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, in the highly organized structure of an adult myocardial cell, the localization of enzymes at distinct subcellular sites may be regulated in different ways, play distinct roles, and fulfill specialized functions. This localization may contribute to cardiac efficiency by playing a crucial role in energy transfer (for review, see Refs. 13Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar and 14Saks V.A. Ventura-Clapier R. Aliev M.K. Biophys. Biochim. Acta. 1996; 1274: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The complex interplay of subcellular energy exchanges emphasizes the need for specific information on the subcellular energetic exchanges in the whole heart. Several mathematical models have been proposed to evaluate the subcellular CK fluxes in the whole organ (15Aliev M.K. Saks V.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 428-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Kemp G.J. Manners D.N. Clark J.F. Bastin M.E. Radda G.K. Mol. Cell.

However, such theoretical approaches rely on several assumptions (the pre-knowledge of the structure of the exchange scheme, the extrapolation of the CK kinetics from in vitro data, a restriction in ADP diffusion at the outer mitochondrial membrane, and so on). Our aim was to develop an experimental approach that does not rely on these assumptions. creatine kinase adenine nucleotide translocator cytosolic ATP mitochondrial ATP ATP in the vicinity of the ATP-consuming sites confidence interval creatine cytosolic CK end diastolic pressure forward CK flux, unidirectional flux of ATP synthesis by CK reverse flux, unidirectional flux of PCr synthesis by CK intermembrane space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane inversion (of PCr or of γ-ATP), protocol of magnetization transfer experiment left ventricular systolic pressure minimal χ2, estimation of the quality of the adjustment mitochondrial CK isoform MM creatine kinase isoform localized in the vicinity of ATP-consuming sites phosphocreatine cardiac oxygen consumption rate pressure product (estimation of contractility) continuous saturation of inorganic phosphate resonance sarcolemma sarcoplasmic reticulum spin lattice relaxation time of species x creatine kinase adenine nucleotide translocator cytosolic ATP mitochondrial ATP ATP in the vicinity of the ATP-consuming sites confidence interval creatine cytosolic CK end diastolic pressure forward CK flux, unidirectional flux of ATP synthesis by CK reverse flux, unidirectional flux of PCr synthesis by CK intermembrane space between the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane inversion (of PCr or of γ-ATP), protocol of magnetization transfer experiment left ventricular systolic pressure minimal χ2, estimation of the quality of the adjustment mitochondrial CK isoform MM creatine kinase isoform localized in the vicinity of ATP-consuming sites phosphocreatine cardiac oxygen consumption rate pressure product (estimation of contractility) continuous saturation of inorganic phosphate resonance sarcolemma sarcoplasmic reticulum spin lattice relaxation time of species x Up to now intracellular compartmentation has been mostly neglected in NMR analysis of CK kinetics in the whole organ. As already pointed out by Wallimann (19Wallimann T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the understanding of CK function might be greatly limited when considering the cell as a homogenous system where enzymes and metabolites have uniform distributions and concentrations. Although the necessity of considering metabolic compartmentation has been previously questioned in NMR analysis of the skeletal muscle (20McFarland E.W. Kushmerick M.J. Moerland T.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1912-1924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), its importance was earlier proposed in the heart (21Koretsky A.P. Wang S. Klein M.P. James T.L. Weiner M.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Zahler R. Bittl J.A. Ingwall J.S. Biophys. J. 1987; 51: 883-893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but hardly experimentally explored. Neglecting the presence of mitochondrial compartments in the NMR analysis indeed results in errors on the determination of CK fluxes (23Joubert F. Gillet B. Mazet J.L. Mateo P. Beloeil J.C. Hoerter J.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A major challenge in the interpretation of NMR data in the whole organ is thus the choice of a kinetic model of analysis. When a single magnetization transfer protocol is performed only simple schemes can be used in the analysis, and the complex cellular organization is beyond the potentiality of NMR. To overcome this limitation, we recently described a new experimental approach that allows the demonstration of the different kinetics of CK localized in subcellular compartments (24Joubert F. Hoerter J.A. Mazet J.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our strategy was to find the best scheme of energetic pathways describing the subcellular exchanges by comparing the time evolution of ATP and PCr magnetization under four NMR inversion protocols with their theoretical evolution predicted from the solution of Bloch equations in various structures of exchange between compartments. We used magnetization transfer of the phosphate moiety as a tracer of myocardial energetic fluxes. Such a combined NMR analysis allowed us to estimate the mitochondrial metabolite compartments and to identify subcellular CK fluxes in a heart perfused in control conditions (24Joubert F. Hoerter J.A. Mazet J.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, due to the high number of variables in complex schemes of exchange, the NMR data per se were still insufficient to resolve all unidirectional subcellular fluxes and pools. In this study, we propose to increase the amount of information by using biochemical data as additional constraints. These include the size of the mitochondrial ATP and PCr compartments measured by subcellular fractionation in non-polar solvent and the mitochondrial flux of ATP synthesis estimated from oxygen consumption. This approach was applied to the perfused rat heart contracting in isovolumic conditions to characterize the pathways of energy transfer. This allowed the experimental validation of a major role of the PCr-CK-Cr shuttle in the energy transfer of a myocardium working under medium load. Interestingly, under partial inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, which impairs contractility, we found a shift in the pathways of energy transfer toward a direct transfer of ATP suggesting that the pathways of energy transfer are modulated by cardiac activity. This investigation conforms with INSERM guidelines defined by the guiding principles of the European Community in the care and use of animals and by the French decree No. 87/84, 1987. Authorization to perform animal experiments was obtained from the French “Ministère de l'Agriculture de la Pêche et de l'Alimentation” (No. 7473, 1997). Hearts of Wistar male rats (350–450 g) were perfused by the Langendorff technique at a constant flow. A latex balloon inserted in the left ventricle was inflated to isovolumic conditions of work, allowing the recording of contractile parameters. The HEPES-buffered perfusate contained sodium acetate (10 mm) as oxidative substrate to minimize the activity of glycolysis. Contractility was characterized by the mean coronary pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure (LVP), end diastolic pressure (EDP), heart spontaneous frequency (HR), and rate pressure product (RPP = HR × LVP in 104 mm Hg·beats·min−1). For each heart the oxygen consumption (QO2) was inferred from the relationship between contractility and QO2 as described previously (25Stepanov V. Mateo P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C. Lechene P. Hoerter J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1397-C1408Crossref Google Scholar). Besides the control group (n = 20), we designed a steady state condition of partial decrease in ATP synthesis by a low cyanide concentration (CN group, n = 17). A stock solution of sodium cyanide dissolved in HEPES buffer (pH 7.35) was prepared just before the experiment and infused at a final concentration of 0.15 mm in the perfusate. At the end of the NMR experiments all hearts were freeze-clamped. Part of the frozen hearts were used to measure ATP, PCr, and creatine contents (in nmol·mg of protein−1) to calculate the metabolite concentrations during magnetization transfer. All data are expressed in mmol·liter−1 of intracellular water assuming 2.72 μl of H2O·mg of protein−1and 160 mg of protein·g wet weight−1. 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 161.93 MHz on an INOVA Varian wide bore magnet in a 20-mm-diameter tube as described previously (23Joubert F. Gillet B. Mazet J.L. Mateo P. Beloeil J.C. Hoerter J.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Control spectra were obtained with 80° pulse angle, 4 K data points acquisition, a spectral width of 10,000 Hz, and a line broadening of 20 Hz. Fully relaxed spectra (repetition time, 10 s) were acquired before and after each inversion experiment. Selective inversion of either PCr (inv-PCr) or γATP (inv-ATP) was achieved by a sinc pulse of 15 ms followed by a variable mixing time (13 mixing times ranging from 0 to 10 s) before the sampling pulse and a 10-s delay for complete relaxation. Acquisition required 24 scans (four scans cycling six times through the whole protocol to minimize eventual metabolic changes). To mask the contribution of ATP-Pi exchange, inv-PCr and inv-ATP protocols were additionally performed with a continuous saturation of Pi resonance by a selective pulse. For each inversion protocol four to five hearts in similar metabolic and contractile steady state conditions were used. For each heart the magnetization of ATP and PCr was followed over time. The method of a combined analysis of several protocols of inversion transfer (inv-) was recently described in detail (24Joubert F. Hoerter J.A. Mazet J.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes the strategy of analysis used to select the minimal kinetic scheme(s) of exchange best describing the NMR data. Briefly, the averaged (±S.D.) time evolutions of γ-ATP and PCr magnetization measured in each of the four inversion protocols were combined in a single set of data. Several schemes of exchange of the phosphorus species describing the pathways of energy synthesis and utilization were investigated. There was no a priori selection of exchange schemes, but only those conferring an organization of compartments compatible with the current knowledge were investigated. Then the theoretical responses of magnetization perturbations induced by the four inversion protocols were computed from the specific Bloch equations describing each exchange scheme. Experimental and computed data were compared. The parameters (unidirectional fluxes, times of relaxation T1of ATP and PCr relaxation, and size of MM-bound compartment, when considered) were adjusted to best fit the measured responses of γ-ATP and PCr of the four inversion protocols. The quality of the fit was evaluated by the χ2 function given by: χ2=∑i=1NATPi−f(ti;a1…aP)ςATP2+∑i=1NPCri−g(ti;a1…aP)ςPCr2Equation 2 where ti, ATPi, and PCri are the averaged experimental data points for the various mixing times (ranging from 1 to N) with their own standard deviation ςi, and the functions f and g are the calculated values of the ATPiand PCri magnetizations. For each scheme we considered parameters as optimal when χ2 reached its lowest value (min-χ2) and the confidence intervals were small. The best minimal scheme(s) of exchange was selected by comparison of the min-χ2 values. We imposed as constraint to the system the global concentrations of metabolites PCr, ATP, and Pi as assessed by NMR and the equality of the global forward and reverse fluxes (steady state conditions of all metabolites) as expected in a steady state organ as described previously (24Joubert F. Hoerter J.A. Mazet J.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine new parameters of interest, in particular both forward and reverse fluxes of the various CKs, the additional constraints were (i) the value of mitochondrial ATP synthesis flux as estimated from the oxygen consumption measured in parallel experiments outside the magnet (25Stepanov V. Mateo P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C. Lechene P. Hoerter J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 42: C1397-C1408Crossref Google Scholar), and (ii) the size of the mitochondrial ATP and PCr compartments previously measured in the same physiological conditions both by NMR and by subcellular fractionation in non-aqueous medium. Mitochondrial ATP amounted to 23 and 16% of total metabolite content in control and CN group, respectively, and mitochondrial PCr amounted to 14 and 7% of total, respectively (26Joubert F. Vrezas I. Mateo P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C. Soboll S. Hoerter J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All experiments started after a 10-min equilibration in isovolumic working conditions. Fig. 2, a and b, shows typical control and cyanide experiments. The metabolite concentrations measured by NMR as well as the contractile characteristics of the hearts remained constant and similar to control throughout the duration of the experiment in the control heart. Both experimental groups were considered in steady state since the changes in metabolite concentrations occurring during the inversion transfer in CN were at least 3 orders of magnitude slower than the kinetics of the fastest reaction (CK) resolved by the NMR protocols. In each physiological condition, contractile and metabolic characteristics were similar in the four inversion protocols (inv-PCr, inv-ATP, inv-PCr-satPi, and inv-ATP-satPi), thus data were pooled (Table I). Partial inhibition of ATP synthesis by low CN concentration resulted in about 60% decrease in contractility and in a moderate rise in EDP. As expected PCr dropped, Pi rose, and ATP decreased by 20%. Intracellular pH remained similar in both groups due to the absence of glucose in the perfusate. For both groups, metabolite contents were similar to those previously observed in hearts used for the determination of mitochondrial fractions (26Joubert F. Vrezas I. Mateo P. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C.

A series of spectra obtained during a protocol of inv-ATP and the time evolutions of PCr and γ-ATP magnetization are shown for a representative control heart (Fig. 3, a and b, respectively). The averaged time evolution of PCr and γATP magnetization (mean ± S.D. of four to six perfused hearts for each inversion protocol) was queued in a single set of data for global analysis (Fig. 3c for the control and Fig. 3d for the CN group). Then the theoretical response of PCr and ATP magnetization was computed for the various schemes of metabolite exchange increasing in complexity from three to six subcellular metabolite compartments (Fig. 4). The cell was first considered to behave as a well mixed solution without compartmentation of metabolites: scheme 1 describes the energetic exchange as a global CK flux and an exchange of ATP with Pi. Then a mitochondrial ATP compartment (ATP2) was considered either exchanging directly with cytosolic ATP, ATP1 (scheme 2), or through mitochondrial CK (scheme 3).Scheme 4 considers three specific CK fluxes (MM-bound, mito-, and cyto-CK) with three ATP compartments (including ATP3, the ATP compartment at the level of the consuming sites: myofibrils, SR, and SL). The comparison of the min-χ2values of each exchange scheme, shown in Fig. 5a, allowed us to propose a minimal structure of exchange best describing the NMR data. In the simplest scheme 1, a homogenous cell exchanging phosphorus between ATP, PCr, and Pi, the min-χ2 value was 324 (confidence interval, c.i. = 4). The introduction of a mitochondrial ATP compartment, ATP2, exchanging directly with cytosolic ATP (scheme 2) clearly degraded the fit (min-χ2value of 724, c.i. = 5). In contrast the fit significantly improved (min-χ2 = 237, c.i. = 7) when ATP2exchanged with PCr via the mito-CK reaction (scheme 3). Scheme 4, which considered the presence of three ATP compartments (ATP1, cytosolic ATP; ATP2, mitochondrial ATP; and ATP3, ATP bound close to myofibrils, SR, and SL) and their exchange via three CK reactions, provided the best data fit (min-χ2 = 149, c.i. = 10). Thus, in our control conditions, the consideration of three kinetically distinct CK reactions (scheme 4) provided the best kinetic scheme describing the NMR experimental data. Table II shows the dynamic parameters obtained for the control hearts in the various exchange scheme. The global CK flux was in the range previously measured by conventional NMR protocols at similar contractile performance (27Mateo P. Stepanov V. Gillet B. Beloeil J.C. Hoerter J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 46: H308-H317Google Scholar, 28Ugurbil K. Petein M. Maidan R. Michurski S. From A.H.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Its value had a tendency to increase (from 7 to 9 mmol·liter−1·s−1) when CK subcellular localization was considered in the analysis. Relaxation parameters of ATP and PCr were hardly affected by the scheme structure. Cytosolic T1 values, which ranged from 3.6 to 5.4 s for PCr and 0.7 to 0.8 s for ATP, were also in agreement with published data. The most striking result was the clear difference in subcellular CK kinetics depending on their localization. When mito-CK was considered (schemes 3 and 4), no significant forward mitochondrial CK flux (ATP synthesis) could be evidenced. In scheme 4, selected from the χ2 analysis as our best minimal exchange scheme, the flux Ff of ATP synthesis was negligible (Ff = 0.3 mmol·liter−1·s−1, c.i. = 0.6) compared with the flux of PCr synthesis (Fr = 2.6 mmol·liter−1·s−1), which accounted for about 27% of the total reverse CK flux. On the opposite, at the level of MM-bound CK, both forward and reverse fluxes were detected. The reaction slightly favored ATP synthesis (Ff was 1.7-fold Fr). The ATP compartment (ATP3) exchanging via MM-bound CK amounted to 15% (c.i. = 11) of total cellular ATP. Cytosolic CK was at equilibrium and accounted for about one-third of the total CK flux.Table IIDynamic parameters obtained in each model tested for the control conditionScheme numberCK fluxesT1CKcytoCKmitoCKMM-boundGlobalT1PCrT1ATPFfFrFfFrFfFrFf=FrT1PCr1T1PCr2T1ATP1T1ATP2T1ATP317.2*7.2 (0.3)7.23.7 (0.2)0.7 (0.1)28.1*8.1 (0.6)8.14.9 (1.3)1.4 (0.7)0.7 (0.1)0.7 (0.1)36.7*4.4 (0.5)0.3 (0.5)2.6*7.03.6 (0.5)2.9 (0.8)0.7 (0.1)0.7 (0.1)43.2*3.2 (1.7)0.3 (0.6)2.6*5.5*3.2 (4)9.05.4 (3)2.9 (1.1)0.8 (0.4)0.6 (0.1)0.3 (0.3)Ff refers to the flux PCr → ATPx and Fr to ATPx → PCr of each compartment.

DNA polymerase λ contains all the critical residues involved in DNA binding, nucleotide binding, nucleotide selection, and catalysis of DNA polymerization and has been assigned to family X based on sequence homology with polymerase β, λ, μ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Here we describe a purification of DNA polymerase λ from calf thymus that preferentially can replicate damaged DNA. By testing polymerase activity on non-damaged and damaged DNA, DNA polymerase λ was purified trough five chromatographic steps to near homogeneity and identified as a 67-kDa polypeptide that cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies against DNA polymerase β and polyclonal antibodies against DNA polymerase λ. DNA polymerase λ had no detectable nuclease activities and, in contrast to DNA polymerase β, was aphidicolin-sensitive.

The first 239 amino acids of the N-terminal part of pol λ with the exception of the nuclear localization signal have no counterpart in pol β. This N-terminal part of pol λ has similarity to yeast pol IV and contains a BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain (2Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L.A. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L.

The BRCT domain is present in several proteins involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint control (3Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V.

The remaining part of pol λ is composed of the catalytic core, which is similar to pol β (8-kDa DNA deoxyribophosphodiesterase domain and 32-kDa finger, palm, and thumb-polymerization domain) and has 32% amino acid identity to pol β (2Garcı́a-Dı́az M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and can substitute pol β in in vitro base excision repair (BER), suggesting that pol λ participates in BER. Pol β is the main pol involved in the BER of lesions generated by monofunctional alkylating agents in eukaryotic nuclear DNA, and pol λ was proposed to be involved in the other types of BER (5Garcı́a-Dı́az M.

However, understanding the possible physiological roles of this enigmatic pol would require a complete characterization of the biochemical properties of the endogenous enzyme. In this study, we describe, for the first time, the isolation of endogenous pol λ from a mammalian tissue. Remarkably, this activity was isolated by an activity assay that uses damaged DNA as a template, suggesting a possible role of pol λ in DNA repair and translesion synthesis. Phosphocellulose P11 was obtained from Whatman, hydroxyapatite from Bio-Rad, HiTrap Desalting, HiTrap heparin, mono Q, and mono S columns fromAmersham Biosciences. Pepstatin, leupeptin, and aphidicolin were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Fluka. All stock solutions were filtered through nitrocellulose before use (0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schüll). The following buffers were used: buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mm PMSF); buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mm PMSF); buffer 3 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mm PMSF, and different molar concentrations of NaCl), buffer 4 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mm PMSF, and different molar concentrations of potassium phosphate); buffer 5 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 2 mmEDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 mm PMSF, and different molar concentrations of NaCl). Amersham Biosciences was the supplier of poly(dA) and oligo(dT)12–18. The homopolymer poly(dA) was mixed to the oligomer oligo(dT)12–18 at a 10:1 base ratio in 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA heated at 60 °C for 5 min with subsequent slow cooling to room temperature. To create apurinic sites, the DNA template poly d(A)/oligo d(T) at a 10:1 base ratio was incubated at a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml at 70 °C in the following buffer: 10 mm sodium citrate, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 5.2. This treatment specifically hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond between the purine base and the deoxyribose moiety, releasing the base without interrupting the continuity of the sugar-phosphate backbone. The degree of DNA damage was checked at different incubation times by monitoring the loss of DNA synthesis efficiency by pols α, β, and δ. For the preparation of the apurinic poly(dA)/oligo(dT) template, an incubation time of 40 min was selected, corresponding to a loss of 80% DNA synthesis efficiency by pols α and β and 73% by pol δ if compared with the corresponding non-damaged poly(dA)/oligo(dT). The mouse monoclonal antibody against rat pol β protein was purchased from NeoMarkers (Freemont, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against mouse pol λ was a gift from L. Blanco (Madrid, Spain). A final volume of 25 μl contained the following components: 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 1 mm DTT, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 20 μm[3H]dTTP, 0.5 μg of poly(dA)/oligo(dT)12–18 (10:1 base ratio) or 0.1 μg of depurinated poly(dA)/oligo(dT)12–18 (10: 1 base ratio) and enzyme to be tested. 1 unit of enzyme activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTTP into acid-precipitable material in 60 min at 37 °C. All enzymatic pol tests were performed with poly d(A)/oligo (dT)12–18 or with damaged poly d(A)/oligo (dT)12–18, and isolation steps were performed at or near 0 °C. 70 g of calf thymus were resuspended in 210 ml of buffer 1 and homogenized in a Sorvall Omnimixer. After centrifugation in a GSA rotor at 12,000 rpm for 45 min, the pellet was washed additionally in buffer 1. This pellet (35 g) was resuspended in 140 ml of buffer 2, homogenized, rotated for 2 h, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant (detergent extract) was brought to pH 7.0 to yield fraction I. Fraction I was loaded onto a 60-ml P11 phosphocellulose column, equilibrated previously in buffer 3 with 50 mm NaCl. The column was first washed with 600 ml of buffer 3 (50 mm NaCl), and the proteins were eluted with 500 ml of a linear 50–700 mm gradient of NaCl in buffer 3. The peak fractions containing pol activity on damaged DNA eluted between 220 and 300 mm NaCl and were pooled to yield fraction II. Fraction II was adsorbed to a 6-ml hydroxyapatite column, equilibrated previously in buffer 4. After washing with 10 column volumes of buffer 4 with 20 mm potassium phosphate, a 10-column volume of a linear 20–500 mm potassium phosphate gradient in buffer 4 was developed. On this column, separation of pols that do not synthesize on the damaged template was achieved (see Fig. 1 A). The pol activity on the damaged template was eluted between 250 and 350 mm potassium phosphate, pooled, and desalted to yield fraction III. Fraction III was loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column equilibrated in buffer 3 (50 mmNaCl), the column was washed with 6 ml of buffer 3 (50 mmNaCl), and the pol activity was eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 50–1000 mm NaCl in buffer 3. The active fractions were eluted between 550 and 650 mm NaCl, pooled, and desalted to yield fraction IV. Fraction IV was loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography mono Q column, equilibrated in buffer 5 (50 mm NaCl), washed with 5 ml of buffer 5 (50 mmNaCl), and eluted with a 15-ml 50–1000 mm NaCl linear gradient in buffer 5. The active fractions were eluted between 380 and 500 mm NaCl, pooled, and desalted to yield fraction V. Fraction V was loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography mono S column, equilibrated in buffer 5 (50 mm), and washed with 5 ml of buffer 5 (50 mm NaCl). The pol activity was eluted with a 10-ml 50–500 mm linear gradient in buffer 5 as a homogeneous peak. The active fractions were immediately frozen in small aliquots to −80 °C until further use. Bacteriophage M13mp2 and Escherichia coli strains CSH50, NR9099, and MC1061 were as described in Ref.6Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar. Nonsense mutant M13mp2T90 (point mutation G:T in the position +90 of the lacZ gene) was selected after sequencing analysis of colorless mutants as a mutation hot point in the DNA M13mp forward mutation assay. The sequence of the 26-mer oligonucleotide was: 5′-cga tta agt tgg gta acg cca ggg tt-3′. This oligonucleotide was hybridized in addition to the gap molecules (the 3′-end of the primer being located as three nucleotides from the point substitution T in the nonsense mutant instead of G in M13mp2 DNA at position +90 of lacZ gene) to verify that in every case, the nucleotides were incorporated in the nonsense codon TAA. Forward and reverse mutation assays were done according to Ref. 6Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1494-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar. Replication reactions for the forward mutation assay were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in 10 μl containing: 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 ng of gapped circular M13mp2 DNA, 20 μm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.03 units of either pol λ or pol β. In this case, about 250–300 nucleotides were incorporated per DNA template, although for calculation of the error rate, it was necessary to fill 250 nucleotides of 350 gapped. Replication reactions for the reverse mutation assay were carried out for 10 min by using as a template M13mp2T90 DNA with an additional 26-mer oligonucleotide. All other conditions were identical to the forward mutation assay. The following three methods were carried out according to established protocols: SDS-PAGE (7Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar), immunoblotting (8Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar), and in situ polymerase activity gel analysis (9Spanos A. Sedgwick S.G. Yarranton G.T. Hübscher U. Banks G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1825-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Calf thymus detergent extract was fractionated using a damaged DNA as the template for measuring DNA polymerase activity (see “Materials and Methods”), and DNA polymerase activity was monitored through different chromatographic steps (Fig. 1 A). On the second purification step, a peak eluting between 250 and 350 mmpotassium phosphate, which had a similar activity on both the non-damaged and damaged DNA, was separated by the bulk of DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1 B). This activity was then purified through HiTrap Heparin-Sepharose, mono Q and mono S columns. The resulting peak fractions (Fig. 1 C) were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and showed a single band of 67 kDa (Fig. 1 D). The final mono S fraction (fraction VI) was analyzed by immunoblot for a variety of known pols, such as pols α, β, δ, and ε. No bands were observed with antibodies against pols α, δ, and ε (data not shown), but a strong signal was discovered for a 67-kDa polypeptide with a monoclonal antibody against human recombinant pol β (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that we had isolated a β-like pol. Next, the same mono S fraction was tested with an antibody against pol λ, and a clear signal was again obtained for this polypeptide (Fig. 2 B). All pols of family X have very conserved DNA polymerase domains (2Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L.A. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M. Garcı́a-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar); therefore, the cross-reactivity of pol λ with pol β antibody was not unexpected. Next, we tested whether this 67-kDa polypeptide was responsible for the polymerase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 C, in situ activity gel analysis showed that the polypeptide corresponding to the 67-kDa band was able to incorporate nucleotides into a DNA template. These data strongly suggested that the pol isolated from calf thymus using a damaged DNA as the template is pol λ. Accordingly, only pol λ among family X pols has an expected molecular mass of 64–67 kDa based on the cDNA sequence of human and mouse. It has been reported that N-terminal domain of pol λ shares similarity with yeast pol IV and that the C-terminal domain shares similarity with mammalian pol β (2Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L.A. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M. Garcı́a-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although yeast pol IV shows the properties typical for pol β, the apparent molecular mass of the polypeptide is larger (68 kDa) (10Shimizu K. Santocanale C. Ropp P.A. Longhese M.P. Plevani P. Lucchini G. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27148-27153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that pol λ, rather than pol β, is the homolog of yeast pol IV. Since the pol activity after the last mono S column was low, an optimization and characterization was performed. These are summarized in Fig. 3. The pH optimum of pol λ was 6.5 with 50 mm bis-Tris, Tris-HCl, or 15 mm potassium phosphate buffers. The Mg2+ optimum was 1.5 mm, and for Mn2+, it was 0.5 mm. The Km for the nucleotide substrate (dTTP) was 5.9 μm, and the Vmax was 0.38 pmol/min. The ratio Vmax/Km was 2.57 × 10−3 min−1 × 1 μl−1, which is a lower estimation of kcat/Km. These results are significantly different from those for human recombinant pol λ, which has low Km (0.5 μm) for the nucleotide substrate and optimal conditions for pol activity at pH 7.5 and 10 mm MgCl2 (11Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Bebenek K. Sabariegos R. Domı́nguez O. Rodriguez J. Kirchhoff T. Garcı́a-Palomero E. Picher A.J. Raquel J. Ruiz J.F. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13184-13191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Pol β is resistant to inhibition by aphidicolin (10Shimizu K. Santocanale C. Ropp P.A. Longhese M.P.

Biochem. 1979; 97: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); therefore, it was interesting to examine the purified calf thymus pol λ for this inhibitor. Unexpectedly and in contrast to pol β, pol λ was aphidicolin-sensitive. Pol β is the least accurate classical mammalian pol, with an average substitution error rate of about 10−3 (13Osheroff W.P. Jung H.K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3642-3650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Human recombinant pol μ (a member of family X DNA polymerases) is an error-prone pol (14Domı́nguez O. Ruiz J.F. Laı́n de Lera T. Garcı́a-Dı́az M. González M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martı́nez-A C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replication fidelity of natural pol λ has never been measured before. Therefore, we compared the fidelity of calf thymus pol λ with human recombinant pol β. A 6-fold more accurate synthesis was observed for pol λ as compared with pol β in a forward mutation assay (Table I) when both base substitution and frameshift mutation were determined. We have used 2-h gap filling reactions. Under these conditions, even if neither a 3′→5′ exonuclease nor any other nuclease was identified in pol λ fractions, a very minor proofreading activity could influence the overall fidelity due to a long incubation. To exclude this probability and estimate a share of base substitutions from total errors, we used the additional reverse mutation system on M13mp2T90 DNA with only a 10-min synthesis (see “Materials and Methods”). The data from Table II confirmed a 5-fold higher fidelity of pol λ as compared with pol β. Errors can occur during any DNA synthesis reaction in a cell, including the gap filling synthesis required for mismatch repair, BER, or nucleotide excision repair. These repair processes require different amounts of DNA resynthesis, catalyzed by pols having very different error rates. The main repair pol β has an average substitution error rate of about 10−3. If this was the error rate in vivo, only BER-associated synthesis of pol β would yield about 10 errors per day (15Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). However, the fidelity of a complete BER complex must be higher than that of the pol alone. It was shown that pol β misinsertion might be proofread by an extrinsic exonuclease (16Höss M. Robins P. Naven T.J.P. Pappin D.J.C. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Shevelev I.V. Belyakova N.V. Kravetskaya T.P. Krutyakov V.M. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or subsequently corrected by some forms of DNA mismatch repair. Furthermore, it was shown that an alternative BER pathway can utilize pols δ and ε. Using nuclear extracts from wild-type and β-pol null mouse fibroblasts, it has been demonstrated that this alternative BER pathway has a repair patch size of about two to six nucleotides (18Stucki M. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Fortini P. Wilson S.H. Hübscher U. Dogliotti E. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have identified pol λ from calf thymus as a pol activity scoring better on damaged versus non-damaged DNA. The facts that pol λ can incorporate nucleotides on damaged DNA and has 5- to 6-fold higher fidelity than pol β suggest that pol λ can contribute substantially to DNA repair. Thus, based on our results, we suggest that pol λ could be responsible for this additional long patch BER pathway. It was shown recently that human recombinant pol λ performs a limited but significant strand displacement synthesis on gapped DNA substrates, a capacity that would be essential to allow the participation of pol λ in long patch BER (5Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Blanco L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34659-34663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It was also shown that human recombinant pol λ exhibits 5′-deoxyribose phosphate lyase activity and, in coordination with its polymerization activity, efficiently repaired uracil-containing DNA in an in vitro reconstituted BER reaction. Thus, pol λ may participate in single-nucleotide BER in mammalian cells. The mRNA for human pol λ was highly abundant in testis, although basal levels were detected in all tissues examined (2Garcı́a-Dı́az M. Domı́nguez O. López-Fernández L.A. Laı́n de Lera T. Sanı́ger M.L. Ruiz J.F. Párraga M. Garcı́a-Ortiz M.J. Kirchhoff T. del Mazo J. Bernad A. Blanco L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, and in addition to demonstrating its putative role in meiotic recombination, it will be relevant to determine whether pol λ could also have a role in homologous recombination (e.g. repair of double-stranded breaks, a process contributing to genetic stability in somatic cells).Table IMutation frequencies of DNA polymerases λ and β by the forward mutation assayPolTotal plaquesMutant plaquesMutation frequencyError rate1-aThe error rate in each case was calculated by the next subtracting the background (4.2 × 10−4) from the mean of the mutant frequency (for pol β 480.0 × 10−4), dividing by 0.5 (the approximate probability of expressing error), and then dividing by the number of sites (110), yielding an average error rate of 1/1,200 nucleotides (for pol β).

Cells lacking cmk2 gene were specifically sensitive to oxidative stress conditions. Upon stress, Cmk2 was phosphorylated in vivo, and this phosphorylation was dependent on the stress-activated MAPK Sty1/Spc1. Co-precipitation assays demonstrated that Cmk2 binds Sty1. Furthermore,in vivo or in vitro activated Sty1 was able to phosphorylate Cmk2, and the phosphorylation occurred at the C-terminal regulatory domain at Thr-411. Cell lethality caused by overexpression of Wis1 MAPK kinase was abolished by deletion of cmk2 or by mutation of Thr-411 of Cmk2. Taken together, our data suggest that Cmk2 acts downstream of Sty1 and is an essential kinase for oxidative stress responses.

Pap1 and Atf1 are required for the induction of ctt1 and other genes in response to oxidative stress.Ctt1 encodes cytoplasmic catalase, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and protects cells from oxidative stress (27Nakagawa C.W. Mutoh N. Hayashi Y. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress brings accumulation of Pap1 to the nucleus in a Sty1-dependent manner (24Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, the reason why Sty1 is required for nuclear translocation of Pap1 is not known, since Pap1 is not a substrate of Sty1 (26Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.C. Toda T.

Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were used as recommended by their suppliers (New England Biolabs or MBI Fermentas). Recovery of DNA fragments from agarose gels was performed with a CLONTECH Advantage PCR pure kit, following the manufacturer instructions. The S. pombe strains to be assayed for sensitivity to various toxic compounds were first grown on fresh YES plates, after which the cells were streaked on YES plates containing the specific compound at the indicated concentration (sodium arsenite 0.4 mm, calcium chloride 300 mm, hydrogen peroxide 0.6 mm) and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. The cmk2::ura4+ disruptant mutant was generated by inserting a 1.8-kilobase fragment encoding the ura4+ gene between the BglII -HinDIII sites of cmk2 from plasmid pVA21 (plasmid pBluescript containing the chromosomal PstI -XhoI fragment from cmk2).2 The ura4+ gene was amplified from pURA4 plasmid using VA6 and T7 oligonucleotides. VA6 is essentially the standard T3 promoter oligonucleotide with an added BglII site (underlined), cgccaaagatctattaaccctcactaaag. The amplified fragment was digested with BglII and HinDIII and ligated to pVA21, creating plasmid pVA24. The fragment PstI-BamHI isolated from plasmid pVA24 was used to transform the wild-type strain. Stable ura+transformants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting. To tag genomic cmk2 with two copies of the HA epitope and hexahistidine, plasmid pREP1-cmk2 2 was digested with PstI and SacI, releasing a ∼3-kilobase fragment that contained the full nmt1-cmk2 expression cassette and was cloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene) digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was digested with HinDIII, which released the full nmt1 promoter and the first 215 amino acids of Cmk2, and ligated to leu2+ from pREP1 plasmid digested with HinDIII. The resulting construction was linearized with SnaB1, transformed into the appropriate S. pombe strains (See Table I), and selected for Leu+ transformants. Plates were replica-plated four times on rich YES media and finally selected on Edinburgh synthetic minimal medium plates lacking leucine. Colonies that grew on selective media were screened for HA integration by immunoblotting with a specific anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) epitope antibody. Cells containing cmk2-His6Ha did not show any phenotype compared with wild-type cells (i.e. oxidative stress). To replace the endogenous cmk2 gene by a cmk2 with a point mutation on Thr-411 to Ala, the cmk2T411A from pGEX-KG-cmk2T411A plasmid (described in next paragraph) was digested with SnaBI and NotI, releasing a fragment that contained the cmk2T411A, and ligated to plasmid pBluescript SK (described in the previous paragraph) digested with the same enzymes, and the construction was integrated as described above. The bacterial expression plasmid pGEX-KG allowed the expression of GST-fused proteins in Escherichia coli. cmk2 from pREP1-cmk2 plasmid was digested with NdeI and NotI and cloned into the pGEX-KG plasmid. Mutagenesis of cmk2 to create cmk2K94A, cmk2T411A, cmk2K94AT411A was achieved by PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides at the site of the mutation and verified by DNA sequencing (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). Truncation of cmk2 was made by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KG with NdeI/NotI. Truncation cmk2Δ3 (341 amino acids) was made using primers Cmk2–5′, cacacacacaccatatgtcgatactagcggggttt, and Cmk2Δ3, cacaccatggtcagcggccgcaatcgtatct. Truncation cmk2Δ6 (402 amino acids) was made using primers Cmk2–5′ and Cmk2Δ6, cacacagcggccgcaaagagggtgagtagcgctttt. Truncation cmk2Δ7 (102 amino acids) was made using primers Cmk2Δ7, cacacatatgttaagttcttattcggagcca, and Cmk2–3′, gggggggcggccgctattaacacgtttagcaga. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, and pellets were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). GST proteins were purified by absorption to glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences), and after subsequent washing in NETN buffer, they were eluted with the elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm glutathione, 2 mmdithiothreitol). The Sty1 protein was purified from cells expressing Sty1 fused to an HA peptide epitope and a His6 in the C-terminal tail. Pelleted cells were lysed into denatured lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL ((octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and purification was carried out by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Immuno Pure Immobilized Protein A, Pierce). Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol). Wild-type cells were transformed with pREP41-sty1–9myc or pREP42-Cmk2-HA6His or both plasmids. Cells were grown in minimal medium for 20 h in the absence of thiamine. Pelleted cells were lysed into lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and protein A-Sepharose beads or with anti-Myc and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). Beads were washed with lysis buffer three times and resuspended with 35 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and co-precipitation was monitored by Western blotting with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-Myc. Phosphorylation of Cmk2 protein was monitored by Western blot analysis of HA-tagged Cmk2. The MB260, MB269, and MB264 strains (Table I) were grown in the presence of 1 mm sodium arsenite for 0, 5, 15, and 30 min. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The samples (15 μg protein/μl) were dephosphorylated by treatment with λ phosphatase (400 units/μl, Calbiochem) for 60 min at 30 °C. Cell extracts containing 100 μg of total protein were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Micropore). Membranes were probed with a monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Phosphorylated and activated Sty1 protein was detected by Western blotting with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs). Phosphorylation of Cmk2 by Sty1 activated in vivo. The Sty1-HA6his protein was purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from yeast cells treated or not with 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min in wild type or Δwis1 background. 5 μg of GST-Cmk2KA or 5 μg of the different Cmk2 forms fused to GST protein purified from E. coli were added to the purified Sty1-HA6his protein activated in vivo together with 20 μm ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/μl). The mixture was then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were terminated by addition of SDS loading buffer. Labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using dried gels. One microgram of recombinant GST-Sty1 from E. coli was activated by phosphorylation using 0.5 μg of GST-Pbs2(EE) in the presence of kinase buffer and ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. 5 μg of the different Cmk2 forms fused to GST protein purified from E. coli were added to the previous mixture together with [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μCi/μl). The mixture was then incubated for 5 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were terminated by addition of SDS loading buffer. Labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using dried gels. We identified cmk2 in the fission yeast genome-sequencing project (Sanger Centre) while searching for open reading frames with homology to calmodulin-dependent kinases. Cmk2 was included in chromosome 1 cosmid (C23A1, GenBankTM accession number AL021813), and it contained three exons encoding a putative Ser-Thr protein kinase of 504 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 57 kDa. A computer-based amino acid sequence homology search for known proteins revealed that the greatest degree of amino acid sequence identity was shared with budding yeast RCK1 and RCK2 (CLK1) kinases (42 and 43% identity, respectively) and to calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) (40% identity to rat CaMKI and 35% to rat CaMKII). RCK1 and RCK2 were first described as suppressors of radiation sensitivity of fission yeast G2 arrest-deficient mutants (rad1,rad3, rad9, rad17, and chk1) (31Dahlkvist A. Kanter-Smoler G. Sunnerhagen P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). They have a long glycine-rich insert between consensus domains VIb and VII of protein kinases, which is also present in Cmk2. Rck2p/Clk1p has also been described in budding yeast as a calmodulin kinase-like protein (30Melcher M.L. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29958-29968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although it does not bind calmodulin. To examine the cellular function of Cmk2, gene disruption of cmk2 was performed. A construct in which cmk2 was replaced by the S. pombe ura4+ gene was generated (see “Materials and Methods”). This construct was used to replace the genomic copy of cmk2 in a ura4-D18 strain. The correct integration of the construct in the resulting strain was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis (data not shown). The cmk2::ura4+ strain was viable, and it presented no morphological abnormalities. To examine the role of Cmk2 in the stress response, Δcmk2 cells or cells lacking various components of the Sty1 MAP kinase pathway were grown on rich medium in the presence of osmotic (300 mm CaCl2) or oxidative stress (0.6 mm H2O2 or 0.4 mmsodium arsenite). We would like to highlight the fact that, like cells lacking either sty1 or pap1, Δcmk2 cells did not grow in conditions of oxidative stress caused by 0.6 mm hydrogen peroxide or 0.4 mm sodium arsenite (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast to Δsty1 and Δatf1 cells, Δcmk2 cells proliferated in the presence of 300 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 1 A) or 1m KCl (data not shown). Thus, cmk2 is required for oxidative stress response. The previous result shows that Cmk2 is a component of the oxidative stress response. Because Sty1 is rapidly phosphorylated and activated by Wis1 after oxidative stress, we next determined whether Cmk2 is also phosphorylated after oxidative stress. Wild-type and Δsty1 strains were subjected to a brief oxidative stress, and endogenous expression of HA-tagged Cmk2 protein was monitored by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. Under oxidative stress, Cmk2 showed slower mobility bands in addition to the main Cmk2 band (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). The slow mobility bands of Cmk2 observed at 15 and 30 min after oxidative stress were paralleled by the activation of Sty1 MAPK, as shown by Western blotting of the same samples using monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated p38 SAPK (human Sty1 homologue) (Fig. 2 A,lower panel). The slower migrating bands of Cmk2 appeared due to phosphorylation, since the altered mobility pattern was reversed on treating extracts from stressed cells with λ phosphatase (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). In addition, when Cmk2 phosphorylation was studied upon oxidative stress in a mutant deficient in the SAPK pathway, Δsty1 strain, no slow mobility bands of Cmk2 were observed after oxidative stress compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, Cmk2 is phosphorylated after oxidative stress in a Sty1-dependent manner. We tested the interaction between Cmk2 and Sty1 by in vivo immunoprecipitation. Yeast cells were transformed with a multicopy plasmid overexpressing Myc-tagged Sty1 or HA-tagged Cmk2 or both in the absence of thiamine. Cmk2 was immunoprecipitated using specific anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3 Cmk2 IP, lower panel), and the presence of Sty1-9myc in the precipitates was revealed with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3, Cmk2 IP,upper panel). As shown in Fig. 3 (Cmk2 IP,lane 3), Cmk2 coprecipitated Sty1. Conversely, when Sty1-9myc was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies against Myc (Fig. 3, StyI IP, lower panel), the presence of Cmk2-HA in the precipitates was determined with specific anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3, Sty1 IP, upper panel), Sty1-co-precipitated Cmk2 (Fig. 3, Sty1 IP, lane 3). These results indicate that Cmk2 binds the Sty1 MAPK kinase. We then tested whether activated Sty1 was able to phosphorylate Cmk2. Wild-type cells or wis1-deleted cells expressing HA-tagged Sty1 were exposed to oxidative stress for 10 min, and Sty1-HA was then immunoprecipitated by using monoclonal anti-HA antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. The activation of Sty1-HA was assessed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated p38 SAPK (Fig. 4 A). Immunoprecipitated Sty1 was incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and a catalytically inactive GST-Cmk2, named GST-Cmk2KA, which contains Lys-94 mutated to Ala. The use of a kinase-deficient Cmk2 was necessary to avoid autophosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Cmk2KA was significantly phosphorylated when the protein was incubated with activated Sty1. In contrast, no Sty1-dependent phosphorylation was detected when the protein was incubated with inactive Sty1 from wis1-deleted cells. To map the phosphorylation site for Sty1 in Cmk2, we created several truncated Cmk2 alleles. Cmk2 contains four putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites at the C-terminal domain (Thr-370, Thr-393, Thr-411, Ser-436). We generated truncated versions of Cmk2 containing different domains, one containing Thr-370 and Thr-393 (Cmk2Δ6KA, Fig. 5 A) and the other containing Ther-411 and Ser-436 (Cmk2Δ7, Fig. 5 A). The two Cmk2Δ6KA and Cmk2Δ7 alleles together with the kinase domain (Cmk2Δ3, Fig. 5 A) and full-length Cmk2 were expressed as GST-fused proteins in E. coli and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by Sty1 activated in vivo. Cmk2-truncated forms of Cmk2 contained the Lys-94 mutated to Ala (referred as KA) to create catalytically-deficient enzymes. The C-terminal-truncated forms containing the catalytic domain of Cmk2, Cmk2Δ3KA (from amino acids 1 to 341), and Cmk2Δ6KA (from amino acids 1 to 402) were not phosphorylated by Sty1 compared with the full-length protein (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, Cmk2Δ7, which contains the last 100-residues of the C terminus, was phosphorylated by Sty1 as efficiently as the full-length, suggesting that the C-terminal regulatory domain of Cmk2 is the target of Sty1 phosphorylation and that phosphorylation is restricted to Thr-411 or Ser-436. We created a point mutation version to replace Thr-411 by Ala of the Cmk2Δ7 truncation (Cmk2Δ7T411A, Fig. 5 A) and tested it for phosphorylation by Sty1. As shown in Fig. 5 B, phosphorylation of Cmk2 by Sty1 was mainly abolished in the mutated version. We then attempted to determine whether Sty1 directly phosphorylates Cmk2 using purified proteins in an in vitro kinase assay. For this purpose, Sty1 was purified as a GST fusion protein from E. coli (see “Material and Methods”). Purified Sty1 was incubated with a constitutively activated version of the S. cerevisiae Wis1-related kinase Pbs2 (32Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the first step of the reaction, Sty1 was activated by phosphorylation in the presence of purified Pbs2(EE) and ATP. Thereafter, Cmk2 fragments, purified from E. coli as GST fusion proteins, were added to the reaction together with [γ-32P]ATP. Pbs2 did not phosphorylate Cmk2 (data do not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 C, lane 1, full-length Cmk2 was phosphorylated directly by the Sty1 kinase. Removal of the C terminus of the protein abolished Cmk2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 C, lanes 3 and 4). Moreover, when a C-terminal polypeptide Cmk2Δ7 (amino acids 402–505) was tested, it was phosphorylated by Sty1, suggesting that the C-terminal region was indeed the main target for Sty1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, mutation of Thr-411 to Ala completely abolished phosphorylation of the C-terminal region (Fig. 5 C,lane 6). Mutation of T411A in the full-length protein dramatically reduced its phosphorylation by Sty1 (Fig. 5 C,lane 2). All these results indicate that Cmk2 is directly phosphorylated by Sty1 and that phosphorylation occurs mainly in the regulatory domain of Cmk2. We also attempted to determine whether the in vivo phosphorylation of Cmk2 in response to oxidative stress was abolished in the point mutation T411A of Cmk2. A plasmid containing cmk2T411A tagged with the epitope HA (cmk2T411A-HA) was generated to replace the endogenous cmk2 and create a yeast strain containing cmk2T411A-HA under the control of the cmk2 promoter. This strain was subjected to a brief oxidative stress, and endogenous Cmk2T411A-HA-tagged protein was monitored by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the phosphorylated bands of Cmk2 were abolished when Thr-411 was replaced by Ala, indicating that Thr-411 is the unique phosphorylation site for Sty1-dependent modification of Cmk2 after oxidative stress. To further confirm the genetic data of the involvement of Cmk2 in Sty1 signaling, we tested whether deletion of c mk2 alters the Sty1 response. Overexpression of Wis1 results in cell lethality (4Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 35Shieh J.C. Martin H. Millar J.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2799-2807PubMed Google Scholar). This lethality can be prevented by deletion of downstream elements like the Sty1 MAPK. We thus tried to determine whether cell lethality caused by overexpression of Wis1 was suppressed by deletion of cmk2 and the phosphorylation site mutant cmk2T411A. Wis1 was overexpressed in wild-type cells, in cmk2-deleted cells, and in cells in which the endogenous cmk2 gene was replaced by cmk2T411A. As shown in Fig. 6, both deletion of the cmk2 gene (Fig. 6 A) or mutation of the Sty1 phosphorylation site of Cmk2 (Cmk2T411A) (Fig. 6 B) partially suppressed cell lethality caused by overexpression of Wis1, further supporting Cmk2 as a direct element of the Sty1 pathway that acts downstream of the Sty1 MAPK. We have identified Cmk2 kinase as a new component of the fission yeast oxidative stress-activated Sty1 MAP kinase response. One central observation is that Cmk2 kinase is essential for oxidative stress responses. Cmk2-deleted cells are sensitive to oxidative stress but not to osmotic, pH, or temperature stress. Furthermore, Cmk2 is a substrate of Sty1 MAPK. Cmk2 binds Sty1, which phosphorylates it in vivo and in vitro after oxidative stress activation. In addition, the biochemical and physiological level of Cmk2 phosphorylation by Sty1 depends on a single phosphorylation site. Finally, cell lethality caused by hyperactivation of Wis1 MAPKK can be suppressed by deletion of cmk2 or by mutation of the Cmk2 site phosphorylated by Sty1. This suggests that Cmk2 and Cmk2 phosphorylation by Sty1 are necessary for the MAPK response. Fission yeast Cmk2 is homologous to budding yeast Rck2, which is a direct substrate of Hog1 MAPK (32Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Teige M. Scheikl E. Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5625-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Hog1 is specific for the cellular response of osmotic stress in budding yeast. Although Rck2 binds and is phosphorylated by Hog1 MAPK, Rck2-deleted cells do not show increased sensitivity to osmotic stress (32Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhagen P. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 36Teige M. Scheikl E. Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5625-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to the Hog1 kinase in budding yeast, Sty1 is activated by multiple environmental stresses including osmotic stress, heat shock, H2O2, UV light, certain DNA-damaging agents, and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (5Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 8Shieh J.C. Wilkinson M.G. Buck V. Morgan B.A. Makino K. Millar J.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1008-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Like Rck2, Cmk2 is a substrate of Sty1 MAPK and in fission yeast Cmk2 is required for the cellular response to oxidative stress, as illustrated by the fact that cells lacking Cmk2 proliferate under oxidative stress. Which is the role of Cmk2 in the oxidative stress response? In fission yeast, the Pap1 transcription factor is a target of Sty1 MAPK in oxidative stress conditions (24Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1391-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pap1 is required for the induction of catalase (ctt1), thioredoxin reductase (trr1), and other genes in response of oxidative stress. In addition, oxidative stress brings about nuclear accumulation of Pap1 in a Sty1-dependent manner (24Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, Pap1 is not a substrate of the Sty1 MAPK (26Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.C. Toda T. Millar J.B. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of Pap1 by Sty1 is not understood. We investigated whether Cmk2 is involved in the regulation of Pap1 transcription activation or nuclear localization, but these are not affected by Cmk2. Loss of Cmk2 did not block the nuclear accumulation of ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein-Pap1 fusion protein (data not shown). Furthermore, Pap1 was not phosphorylated in vitro by Cmk2, and we have also confirm that Pap1 is not phosphorylated by purified in vitro activated Sty1 (data not shown). Thus, Cmk2 is not required for the induction of Pap1-dependent gene transcription or Pap1 cellular localization. In addition to the phosphorylation of transcription factors, MAP kinases are known to activate downstream protein kinases involved in several cellular processes. These include kinases such as MAP kinase-activated protein kinases (MAPKAP-K2 and MAPKAP-K3), MAP kinase signal-integrating kinase (MNK), p38 regulated-activated kinase (PRAK), and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK) (29Thomson S.

Their activation results in the phosphorylation of both the transcription factors CREB and ATF1 and the essential proteins Hsp27 and eIF1e (38New L. Jiang Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y.

During the preparation of this manuscript, in vitro phosphorylation of EF-2 by Rck2 budding yeast kinase has been reported (36Teige M. Scheikl E. Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5625-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which suggests a role for Rck2 in translation. Although the environmental agents that stimulate Rck2 and Cmk2 kinases differ, a similar scenario may be found in fission yeast, in which Sty1 may regulate translation through Cmk2 to display oxidative stress-induced responses. Current studies are under way to identify Cmk2 substrates and further understand the Cmk2-mediated oxidative stress responses. We thank Jonathan Millar for gifts of plasmids and strains."

We compared phosphorylated proteins in heat-shocked and thermotolerant cells using proteome analysis. After HS treatment of control RIF-1 and their thermotolerant derivatives, TR-RIF-1 cells, cellular proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the phosphorylated proteins were detected with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. We found that 93 proteins showed significant changes in phosphorylation between control and thermotolerant cells as a function of recovery time after HS; we identified 81 of these proteins with peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF MS after in-gel trypsin digestion. These phosphorylated proteins exhibit various cellular functions, including chaperones, ion channels, signaling molecules, in transcription and translation processes, in amino acid biosynthesis, oxidoreduction, energy metabolism, and cell motility or structure, suggesting that HS turns on the various signaling pathways by activating protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Of these, 20 proteins were previously identified phosphorylated proteins and 64 were newly identified. These proteins can be grouped into three families: 1) proteins highly phosphorylated in TR-RIF-1 cells at basal level and phosphorylated more significantly by HS in RIF-1 than TR-RIF-1; 2) proteins highly phosphorylated in control RIF-1 cells at basal level and phosphorylated more easily by HS in TR-RIF-1 than in RIF-1 cells; and 3) proteins with a similar basal phosphorylation level in both RIF-1 and TR-RIF-1 cells and responding to HS similarly in both cells. Most of the phosphorylated proteins are presumably involved in HS signaling in different ways, with the first and second families of proteins influencing thermotolerance. The possible tyrosine phosphorylation sites, the possible PTKs phosphorylating these proteins, and the proteins binding to these phosphorylated sites were predicted by the Netphos, ScanProsite, and Scansite programs. These results suggest that HS can activate various PTKs and HS responses can be regulated by phosphorylations of proteins having various functions.

These results suggest that HS can activate various PTKs and HS responses can be regulated by phosphorylations of proteins having various functions. Heat shock responses are well conserved phenomena through evolution. Modest elevations of temperature induce apoptotic cell death. A common feature of the heat shock response is that an initial, nonlethal heat shock provides a transient resistance against subsequent lethal heat shock. This phenomenon is called thermotolerance. Thermotolerant cells induce the overexpression of a family of heat shock proteins (Hsps) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; HSF, heat shock factor; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; RIF, radiation-induced fibrosarcoma; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein.

Throughout this manuscript, the term “protein phosphorylation” is used in short for “protein tyrosine phosphorylation” and “phosphorylation” for “tyrosine phosphorylation.” and are thereby protected from cell death caused by various stresses. This suggests that the chaperonic function of Hsps is associated with the development of thermotolerance. However, the details of the molecular events underlying heat shock responses are not well defined. Heat shock causes a dramatic reprogramming in cellular metabolism. Heat shock affects the cells at the level of the nucleic acids, the membrane, and the cytoskeleton. Heat shock induces a significant reduction in normal transcription and translation processes. The next event in the heat shock response pathway is the activation of heat shock transcription factor (HSF). Activated HSF binds to the heat shock element and induces the synthesis of Hsps (1Craig E.A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 239-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 2Lindquist S. Annu.

Heat shock has been shown previously to alter the phosphorylation of some cellular proteins in several different systems, including soybean seedlings (5Krishnan H.B. Pueppke S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and mammalian cell lines (6Landry J. Crete P. Lamarche S. Chretien P. Radiat.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, there has been increasing evidence that cellular stress responses are regulated by protein kinases. Heat shock activates a number of protein kinases, including p38/HOG1 kinase (8Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

In this study, we examined the global phosphorylation changes after heat shock in a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma cell line, RIF-1, and its thermotolerant derivative, TR-RIF-1. Identifications of phosphorylated proteins induced by heat shock were performed by proteomics combined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and mass spectrometry. Kinetic analysis of protein phosphorylation during recovery after heat shock allowed us to develop information on the relationship between phosphorylated proteins and their possible functions in heat shock response. We sorted the phosphorylated proteins identified into three groups based on the kinetic analysis. Computer-assisted predictions of phosphorylation sites, the PTKs possibly involved, and the proteins that possibly bind to these phosphorylated motifs have been performed to understand the large amount of information. This is a new trial to obtain comprehensive understanding in the signaling pathways activated in response to heat shock. Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma RIF-1 (25Hahn G.M. van Kersen I. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1803-1807PubMed Google Scholar) and thermotolerant TR-RIF-1 cell lines derived from RIF-1 (gifts from Dr. G. M. Hahn) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin G at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. For the heat treatment studies, monolayers of cells grown in tissue culture dishes were incubated at 45 ± 0.1 °C in a water bath. Patterns of cellular protein synthesis after heat shock were examined by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine (1 μCi/ml) in methionine-free RPMI 1640 media for 1 h. The labeled proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, autoradiographed, and quantified by BAS2500 (Fuji photo film). The cells were treated with or without heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min and subsequently lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μm/ml leupeptin, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF) to a final volume of 3 times the original packed cell volume in ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant (cytosol fraction) was separated, and the pellet was resuspended in half-packed cell volume of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.02 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μm/ml leupeptin, 5 mmNa3VO4, 5 mm NaF). High salt buffer (same as low salt buffer except that 0.02 m KCl replaced with 1.2 m KCl) was added to one-half of the packed cells volume in dropwise, incubated in ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 30 min at 14,500 rpm. The supernatant (nucleus fraction) was added to the cytosol fraction. The protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of proteins (700 μg) were added to an immunoprecipitation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μm/ml leupeptin, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF. 5 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was added and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. 20 μl of protein A/G beads were then added and incubated for 1 h. The precipitated immune complexes were washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins from control and heat-shocked cells were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to NC membrane, and probed with polyclonal antibody of GAPDH (gift from Dr. K. S. Kwon) and monoclonal antibody to HSC70/HSP70 (StressGen). The immune complexes were detected with Amersham Biosciences ECL kit and LAS-1000S (Fuji photo film). The protein samples were mixed for 30 min at room temperature with a buffer containing 9.5 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF and electrofocused in 7-cm Immobiline™ DryStrips (pH 4–7, 6–11) with the Amersham Biosciences IPGphor. The following focusing protocol was used: 50 μA per strip at 20 °C; 1) rehydration for 16 h; 2) 500 V for 1 h (step and hold); 3) 1000 V for 1 h (step and hold); and 4) 8000 V for 3 or 9 h (step and hold). After electrofocusing, the strips were shaken for 15 min with equilibration buffer (1.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol) and loaded onto Bio-Rad minigel two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Proteins from SDS-PAGE were stained with Coomassie Blue or Silver or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBST at 4 °C overnight. The protein-antibody complexes were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugate at a 1:2000 dilution. The blots were incubated for 1 min in the ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) solution and exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm,Amersham Biosciences). Images were scanned using a LAS-1000S CCD-based camera and semi-quantitatively analyzed using the software package ImageMaster two-dimensional software (Amersham Biosciences). Each sample was run in triplicate together with internal standards of phosphotyrosine of known molecular weights (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and the ratio of intensity between sample and internal standard was used for the quantitative analysis. The cellular proteins were separated on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue or Silver. Each spot was in-gel digested with some modifications (26Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Quadroni M. James P. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The gel spots were excised with a scalpel, crushed, and destained by washing with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile. In the case of silver-stained gel, it is destained by washing with 15 mm K4Fe(CN)6, 50 mmsodium thiosulfate prior to crushing the gel. The gels were dehydrated by addition of acetonitrile, rehydrated by adding 10–20 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate with 10 ng/μl of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), and incubated at 37 °C for 12–15 h. Peptides were extracted by adding 30 μl of solution containing 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The extraction was repeated three times and completed by adding 20 μl of acetonitrile. The extracted solutions were pooled and evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge. Samples were reconstituted in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and treated with ZipTips containing C18 resin (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The washed peptides were eluted with saturated matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptide mixtures were analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS using a delayed ion extraction and ion mirror reflector mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR; Applied Biosystems, Inc.). External calibration was carried out using Sequazyme Peptide Mass Standard Kit (Perspective Biosystems) and internal calibration, by using the autolytic peaks of trypsin. This procedure typically results in mass accuracies of 50 ppm. For interpretation of the mass spectra, we used the MS-Fit program available on the web site of the University of California, San Francisco (prospector.ucsf.edu/). The phosphorylation sites were predicted by NetPhos program from the website (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos) having low stringency and ScanProsite (www.expasy.ch/tools/scnpsite.html) having high stringency. PTKs involved in phosphorylations, and the possible binding proteins of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were predicted by Scansite program at the website (scansite.mit.edu/). To determine whether protein phosphorylations might be involved in heat shock response and thermotolerance, we first examined the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in control RIF-1 cells and their thermotolerant derivatives, TR-RIF-1 cells. Both RIF-1 and TR-RIF-1 cells were exposed to heat shock at 45 °C for 15 or 45 min. After each treatment, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig.1 A). Tyrosine phosphorylations increased in a dose-dependent manner in both RIF-1 and TR-RIF-1 cells. Some of the phosphorylated proteins were common to the two cell lines and some were different. Next we carried out metabolic labeling of the newly synthesized proteins to determine the kinetics of protein synthesis after heat shock in both cells. Although heat shock at 45 °C for 45 min showed more dramatic increase of tyrosine phosphorylation as shown in Fig.1 A, the cells for this study were exposed to heat shock at 45 °C for only 30 min because heat shock of RIF-1 cells at 45 °C for 45 min caused the severe cell death (28Kim H.J. Lee K.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 229: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was monitored by [35S]methionine pulse labeling during recovery after heat shock. Cells were exposed to heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min, allowed to recover for various lengths of time, and then labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h at 37 °C to measure the protein synthesis rates. Equal amounts of proteins were applied on each lane of SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1 B, heat shock in both cell lines immediately blocked total protein synthesis which was gradually restored with Hsp synthesis first and followed by total synthesis. Recovery rate of protein synthesis in TR-RIF-1 cells was much faster than in RIF-1 cells and both cell lines recovered to normal after 24 h of recovery. Longer exposure to heat shock at 45 °C blocked protein synthesis to a greater degree and resulted in slower recovery or cell death (data not shown). This suggests that it is important to examine the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation level of each protein during recovery after heat shock rather than at a fixed time point. To determine the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins involved in heat shock response, proteome analysis was performed with cells exposed to heat shock and recovered for various times. Both RIF-1 and TR-RIF-1 cells were subjected to heat shock at 45 °C for 30 min and recovered at 37 °C for 0, 4, and 24 h. Cellular proteins harvested at each time point were separated on two sets of two-dimensional gel in two pI ranges, 4–7 and 6–11. The gels were visualized by Coomassie Blue or Silver staining or were blotted to NC membrane and detected with immunostaining using anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody and ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Fig. 2). The immunostained NC membranes were exposed to x-ray film for various times to find the linear range depending on the concentrations of the phosphorylated proteins. The film images were scanned using ImageMaster LabScan version 3.00 software connected to Umax scanner. We found 93 phosphorylated proteins containing both basally phosphorylated proteins and heat shock-induced phosphorylated proteins both in RIF-1 and TR-RIF-1 cells: 52 spots in pI range of 4–7 and 41 spots in pI range of 6–11. Immunostained spots detected in any one of the immunoblot analyses were overlaid and are depicted by numbered arrowsin the silver-stained gel (Fig. 2 A) and Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 2 C). The corresponding immunostained gels were shown in Fig. 2, B and D. Examples of heat shock-induced tyrosine phosphorylation changes detected with immunostaining are shown in Fig. 2 E. Protein spots detected on the immunoblot were cut out from the corresponding gel, subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and mass peptide fingerprint analyses were conducted. Low abundance proteins (weakly stained with silver) were identified by pooling spots from more than three gels. The obtained mass data were fitted by MS-Fit database search analysis. This allowed us to identify 81 of 93 proteins (64 new phosphorylated proteins and 20 phosphorylated proteins that were previously reported). The identified proteins were listed and grouped by their known functions in TableI and as follows: 5 proteins (6 spots) acting in protein folding, 13 proteins (17 spots) functioning in transcription and translation, 4 proteins acting in amino acid biosynthesis, 2 proteins relating to oxidation and reduction, 2 channel proteins, 8 (10 spots) signaling molecules, 11 proteins (16 spots) functioning in cell motility or structure, 13 protein (18 spots) acting in energy metabolism, and 6 miscellaneous proteins. Of these, known tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are as follows: hnRNP A2/B1 and GAPDH are phosphorylated by c-Src (29Pype S. Slegers H. Moens L. Merlevede W. Goris J. J. Biol.

Physical properties of the fiber are determined by the amino acid composition, the complexity of repetitive units, and arrangement of these units into higher order arrays. Except for very short motifs of 6–10 residues, the length of repetitive units and the number of these units concatenated in higher order assemblies vary in all spider and lepidopteran silks analyzed so far. This paper describes an exceptional silk protein represented by the 500-kDa heavy chain fibroin (H-fibroin) of the waxmoth,Galleria mellonella. Its non-repetitive N-terminal (175 residues) and C-terminal (60 residues) parts, the overall gene organization, and the nucleotide sequence around the TATA box show that it is homologous to the H-fibroins of other Lepidoptera. However, over 95% of the protein consists of highly ordered repetitive structures that are unmatched in other species. The repetitive region includes 11 assemblies AB1AB1AB1AB2(AB2)AB2of remarkably conserved polypeptide repeats A (63 amino acid residues), B1 (43 residues), and B2 (18 residues). The repeats contain a high proportion of Gly (31.6%), Ala (23.8%), Ser (18.1%), and of residues with long hydrophobic side chains (16% for Leu, Ile, and Val combined). The presence of the GLGGLG and SSAASAA(AA) motifs suggests formation of pleated β-sheets and their stacking into crystallites. Conspicuous conservation of the apolar sequence VIVI followed by DD or ED is interpreted as indicating the importance of hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge in H-fibroin cross-linking. The environment of G. mellonella larvae within bee cultures requires continuous production of silk that must be both strong and elastic. The spectacular arrangement of the repetitive H-fibroin region apparently evolved to meet these requirements. Proteins of silk fibers are characterized by reiterations of amino acid repeats.

Silk quality reached highest level of functional specialization in spiders and in lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars). The remarkable mechanical properties of the silks (1Gosline J.M. Guerette C.S. Ortlepp C.S. Savage K.N. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3295-3303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) inspired numerous studies on their composition and structural arrangement. Early amino acid analyses and x-ray diffraction studies revealed that the silks of caterpillars contain pleated β-sheets (2Pauling L. Corey R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1953; 39: 253-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sheets formed by short iterated repeats of small amino acid residues are stacked into crystallites that reinforce the silk fiber (3Lucas F. Rudall K.M. Florkin M. Stota E.H. Comprehensive Biochemistry. 26B. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1968: 475-558Google Scholar). Recent data (1Gosline J.M. Guerette C.S. Ortlepp C.S.

Caterpillars produce silk from a pair of labial glands, each of which consist of silk-secreting posterior and middle regions, and an outlet (5Sehnal F. Akai H. Int. J. Insect Morphol. Embryol. 1990; 19: 79-132Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The posterior region produces fibrous silk core, whereas the middle region provides a sticky coating of the fiber and adds several low molecular components with presumably protective functions to the silk (6Z̆urovec M.

For the silkwormBombyx mori it was shown that the H-fibroin (∼390 kDa) and L-fibroin (∼30 kDa) molecules are linked by a disulfide bond, and six such heterodimers are assembled with a single P25 molecule into a complex called elementary fibroin unit (11Inoue S. Tanaka K. Arisaka F. Kimura S. Ohtomo K. Mizuno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40517-40528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The core of tussah silk, which is produced by Antheraea silkmoths, is made up of H-fibroin homodimers (10Tanaka K. Mizuno S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 31: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12Sezutsu H. Yukuhiro K. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). H-fibroin makes up the bulk of the lepidopteran silk fiber, and its structure determines the physical properties of the silk. Five structural silk categories were recognized on the basis of x-ray diffraction studies and amino acid analyses (13Warwicker J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The silk of B. mori was classified as group 1, which is characterized by dense molecule packing (intersheet distance 9.3 Å) corresponding to high glycine content (14Marsh R.E. Corey R.B. Pauling L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 16: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), whereas the tussah silk of Antheraea pernyi was classified as group 3 with 10.6 Å intersheet packing that is consistent with high alanine content (15Marsh R.E. Corey R.B. Pauling L. Acta Crystallogr. 1955; 8: 710-715Crossref Google Scholar). These data were recently supported by full elucidation of the primary H-fibroin structures. The H-fibroin of B. mori was shown to consist of 12 large “crystalline” domains separated by short spacers; each crystalline domain includes a number of glycine-rich repeats dominated by the GAGAGS motif (16Zhou C.-Z. Confalonieri F. Medina N. Zivanovic Y. Esnault C. Yang T. Jacquet M. Janin J. Duguet M. Perasso R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). By contrast, the H-fibroin ofA. pernyi includes 80 tandemly arranged repeats, each containing a crystalline region of 5–15 alanine residues flanked by an “amorphous” motif (12Sezutsu H. Yukuhiro K. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The silk of the waxmoth, Galleria mellonella, a species distant in evolution from both B. mori and A. pernyi, was assigned to structural group 3 as the tussah silk (13Warwicker J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), but partial sequence of the waxmoth H-fibroin did not disclose any regular polyalanine repeats (17Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Also, the silk of G. mellonella has different physical properties than tussah silk. It has a tensile strength 7.5 × 108 Nm−2and 101% extendibility (18Hepburn H.R. Chandler H.D. Davidoff M.R. Insect Biochem. 1979; 9: 69-77Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding values for the tussah silk are 5.8 × 108 Nm−2 and 35%, respectively (19Denny M.W. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1980; 34: 247-272PubMed Google Scholar). Our goal was to clarify the structure of G. mellonella H-fibroin as a step toward understanding the molecular architecture that lends to this silk its unusual physical properties. In a previous study (17Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we isolated from the posterior silk gland region of G. mellonella larvae a cDNA clone designated PG-2. Except for a non-repetitive 0.3-kb 3′ terminus, the clone consisted of repetitive motifs. The corresponding mRNA was not detectable in any other body tissue. Its large size, high abundance in the posterior silk gland section, and the sequence of its putative translation product indicated that PG-2 was derived from the 3′ end of the H-fibroin gene. By using PG-2 as a probe, we have now identified genomic clones that encode considerable portions of both 3′ and 5′ ends of the gene. Sequence analysis revealed that the structure of G. mellonella H-fibroin is exceptionally homogenous and resembles certain spider silks more than the H-fibroins of B. mori and A. pernyi. Our stock of the waxmoth,G. mellonella L. (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) was maintained at 30 °C on a semiartificial diet (20Sehnal F. Z. Wiss. Zool. 1966; 174: 53-82Google Scholar). The posterior parts of silk glands were dissected from anesthetized last instar larvae whose age was measured from the preceding ecdysis. Dissected tissues were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. A genomic library was prepared from 15- to 20-kb Sau3A fragments of G. mellonella DNA (21Yang C. Teng X. Z̆urovec M. Scheller K. Sehnal F. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Fragments were ligated to XhoI half-site arms of the LambdaGEMTM-12 vector (Promega) that was grown in the LE392 strain ofEscherichia coli. About 4 × 104 plaques were screened with 1.2-kb cDNA probe PG-2 representing the 3′ end of the H-fibroin gene (17Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The positive clones were re-screened with the extreme 3′ end of PG-2 (0.3 kb), which encoded non-repetitive C-terminal amino acid sequence. Hybridization with both the full and the truncated PG-2 probes was done under high stringency conditions at 65 °C in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and washing at room temperature twice in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. The clones, which failed to react with the short version of PG-2, were screened with thePstI-BclI fragment of B. mori H-fibroin gene (positions −139 to +69) that contained the 5′ upstream region and the first exon of this gene (22Ohshima Y. Suzuki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This hybridization was done under low stringency conditions at 55 °C in 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5% SDS, with two subsequent washings in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and two washings in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. All probes were32P-labeled with the aid of the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). Selected genomic clones were characterized with restrictases and the restriction fragments subcloned in pBluescript SK(+/−) (Stratagene). Part of the non-repetitive region was sequenced with primer walking. Single- or double-stranded templates were sequenced either manually or with capillary DNA sequencer ABI 310 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The dideoxy chain termination reaction with [α-35S]dATP, T3 or T7 primers, and Sequenase version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences), was employed in the manual sequencing. Automatic sequencing was done with Thermosequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) or ABI Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Most of the analyzed gene regions were sequenced repeatedly from both DNA strands as depicted in Fig. 1. Established sequences were analyzed with the DNAstar software (Lasergene) and with the aid of EMBL network services. For the Southern analysis, high molecular weight genomic DNA was prepared from the newly ecdysed last instar larvae, and 5-μg DNA aliquots were digested with restrictases specified under “Results,” electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel, and blotted on nylon membrane. Aliquots of 5 μg of total RNA, which was prepared from the posterior and middle silk gland regions and from the body carcass devoid of the silk glands, were taken for the Northern blotting. By using high stringency conditions described above, Southern blots were probed with the32P-radiolabeled 1.2-kb PG-2 probe and Northern blots with the XbaI-BamHI fragment of the λX1 genomic clone. Relative positions of HindIII-digested λ phage DNA fragments were used as size markers. The reverse transcription step of reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 5 μg of total RNA, 5 units of avian leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and 50 ng of primer 5′ ATCCAGATGAACCACCT 3′ (positions +2869 to +2853 of the gene, i.e. 4136–4110 in the GenBankTM accession number AF095239) in a 20-μl reaction mix. Subsequently, 1 μg of the reaction mixture was taken for cDNA amplification using a primer corresponding to the gene sequence between positions +9 and +28 (Fig.3 A), and a reverse primer corresponding to positions +2851 to +2832 (4108–4309 in the GenBankTM accession numberAF095239). PCR included initial denaturation as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C, and final extension 10 min at 72 °C. The procedure was described previously (6Z̆urovec M. Yang C. Sehnal F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15423-15428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A 35-nt synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to the region −30 to +4 of the gene (Fig. 3 A) was employed for primer extension analysis using total RNA from the posterior section of silk glands of well staged last instar larvae. The primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with the aid of T4 polynucleotide kinase and hybridized to 10 μg of total RNA for 16 h at 32 °C. The following extension reaction was carried out with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 42 °C. Screening of our G. mellonella genomic library with the PG-2 cDNA clone led to isolation of nearly 60 positive recombinant phages. Most of them were likely to contain inserts from the central gene region with repeated sequences that are difficult to clone and analyze. We therefore decided to select clones extending to the 5′ or the 3′ regions of theH-fibroin gene. Eight clones of the 3′ region were obtained using the unique 0.3-kb 3′ terminus of PG-2 as probe. Clone λXF, which gave the strongest hybridization signal, was chosen for further work. The remaining 52 clones hybridizing with the whole PG2 were screened with a probe derived from the 5′ end of B. mori H. fibroin. Based on experience with other silk genes (21Yang C. Teng X. Z̆urovec M. Scheller K. Sehnal F. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we expected some similarity between the H. fibroin genes ofB. mori and G. mellonella. Indeed, under low stringency conditions, we detected weak hybridization of the B. mori probe to two genomic clones of G. mellonella. The DNA of these clones was isolated, cut withPstI, and re-hybridized with the H-fibroin probe of B. mori. Both clones proved to contain a single 0.7-kb fragment similar in sequence to the first exon of B. mori H-fibroin gene. One of the two clones was taken for further research under the name λX1. Extensive mapping and subcloning revealed the presence of StyI, AccI, andSacI restriction sites that were instrumental in elucidating large parts of the repetitive gene region. The 50 clones, which hybridized only with the full PG-2 probe, apparently contained only the internal sequences of the H-fibroin gene and were not analyzed. Genomic Southern blotting (data not shown) allowed us to construct a restriction map of the whole H-fibroin gene and to assess the size of the entire repetitive region. Localization of the restriction sitesXbaI and BamHI in the clone λX1 and of theSalI and SacI sites in the clone λXF was essential for the overall gene analysis. Genomic DNA fragments obtained by double digestions with XbaI + SalI,XbaI + SacI, BamHI + SalI, and BamHI + SacI, respectively, were probed with PG-2 and some also with the XbaI-BamHI fragment of the clone λX1 and/or the SalI-SacI fragment of the clone λXF (data not shown). Analysis of the data allowed one possible arrangement of the fragments as shown in Fig.1. The overlapping digestion fragments of the λX1 and λXF inserts were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) according to the strategy summarized in Fig. 1 and sequenced. The results (GenBankTM accession numbers AF095239 and AF095240) confirmed that the clones represented the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the H-fibroin gene. By analogy with theH-fibroin gene structure in other lepidopteran species (12Sezutsu H. Yukuhiro K. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,16Zhou C.-Z. Confalonieri F. Medina N. Zivanovic Y. Esnault C. Yang T. Jacquet M. Janin J. Duguet M. Perasso R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), we assume that the internal XbaI-XbaI fragment (7 kb) and adjacent regions represent central part of the second exon (Fig. 1) that is made up of similar repeats as found in clones λX1 and λXF (see below). Northern blots probed with the labeled XbaI-BamHI fragment of clone λX1 (encoding H-fibroin N terminus) disclosed the presence of a single, very large posterior silk gland-specific mRNA (Fig. 2 A). A similar transcript was previously detected with the PG2 probe that encodes H-fibroin C terminus (17Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The sequenced part of the λX1 clone included 1285 nt of the 5′ non-coding region, 42 nt putatively encoding 14 amino acids (beginning with an initiation codon in position +29), 1310 nt evidently non-coding and therefore regarded as an intron, and 4362 nt with a continuous open reading frame. Sequences between positions −426 and −346 in the upstream region, and between +1123 and +1203 in the intron, exhibited about 90 and 70% identity, respectively, with the 3′ end of the repetitive element Gm1(21Yang C. Teng X. Z̆urovec M. Scheller K. Sehnal F. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transcription start of the H-fibroin gene was determined by primer extension analysis using posterior silk gland RNA (Fig.2 B). The analysis disclosed two different transcription starts that appeared to be used singly or simultaneously, depending on the developmental stage of the last instar larva. The transcription start used by the newly ecdysed last instar larvae was assigned +1, and the whole gene was numbered relative to this position. This site was also identified in the H-fibroin gene of other Lepidoptera (Fig. 3 A). In the course of the last larval instar of G. mellonella, the transcription start was shifted to position −18, and the +1 position ceased to be used. Two sequences possibly served as TATA boxes, each of them being associated with one transcription start: a TATAAAA sequence at −30 to −24 and a TAATATA sequence at −49 to −43 (Fig. 3 A). An initiator sequence TCAGT (23Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) at +2 to +6 followed immediately after the transcription start at +1, and a similar sequence TCAGA was localized at −12 to −8, i.e. just a few nucleotides downstream from the transcription start at −18. The exact delimitation of the intron was determined by sequencing across the exon/intron junctions in a cDNA clone obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. The amplified cDNA fragment began at +9 and ended at +2851, thus including almost the entire exon 1 and a part of the large exon 2. The sequencing proved that the first exon consisted of the 28-nt leader sequence and the 42-nt coding sequence (Fig. 3 A). The second exon began with a unique sequence of 532 nt and continued as regular repeats that are described below. The repeats were iterated until the 3′ end of the sequenced part of clone λX1 and the same type of repeats appeared at the 5′ end of clone λXF (Fig. 4). The sequenced portion of the latter clone included 1331 nt of the coding region, of which about 70% consisted of the repeats, and 183 nt of adjacent non-coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF095240). The point of transcription termination, i.e. the 3′ terminus of the second exon, was established by comparing the sequence of λXF with that of the PG-2 cDNA clone (17Z̆urovec M. Sehnal F. Scheller K. Kumaran A.K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 55-67Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was confirmed that the 3′-untranslated region consisted of 94 nt and included polyadenylation signal AATAAA (24Proudfoot N.J. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) localized 23 nt upstream from the transcription terminus. The last 89 nt identified in the λXF clone represented non-transcribed spacer DNA flanking the 3′ end of theH-fibroin gene. The identified λX1 sequence encodes a putative peptide of 1468 amino acid residues (Fig.5 A). The expanse of the first 188 residues exhibits no obvious sequence iterations, but the remainder consists of regular repeats. Compliance with the general rules (25Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) indicates that a signal peptide is cleaved off between residues 18 and 19. The following tract of 170 residues is remarkable by the high content of charged amino acids that are often grouped by 2. The 4.5 pK value reflects prevalence of the negatively charged residues. About one-third of residues in the non-repetitive N terminus is hydrophobic and one-third is polar. Notable is a degenerate doubling of two short sequences. The putative translation product of the sequenced part of clone λXF includes 443 amino acid residues, of which 373 are arranged in repeats, and 70 constitute a non-repetitive C terminus (Fig. 5 A). It is characterized by high content of arginine that shifts the pK value to 11.6, and by the presence of two similar stretches of 7–8 amino acids. The repeats found in clones λX1 and λXF are identical, indicating that they are iterated throughout the central gene region between the two clones. From the genomic Southern mapping summarized in Fig. 1, we estimate that the entire coding region is ∼18,000 nt long and encodes ∼6000 amino acids. The deduced molecular mass of G. mellonella H-fibroin is thus close to 500 kDa, and over 95% of the molecule consists of repeats. They are built up of predominantly neutral amino acids; only about 2.7% residues carry a strong negative charge and 0.6% a positive charge. The composition of repeats is decisive for the amino acid representation in the whole fibroin. Relative representation of amino acid residues in the deduced translation products of λX1 and λXF is consistent with the results of direct amino acid analysis of fibroin extracted from the silk glands (26Michalik J. Sehnal F. Lassota Z. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1984; 31: 139-148PubMed Google Scholar) or the cocoons (27Lucas F. Shaw J.T.B. Smith S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1960; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28Bonnot G. Delobel B. Ann. Zool. Ecol. Anim. 1970; 2: 595-605Google Scholar). Beginning at the predicted amino acid residue 189, the sequence of G. mellonella H-fibroin continues as a regular repetitive arrangement of three types of complex repeats (Fig. 5 A). The repeat A consists of 63 residues, and the repeats B1 and B2consist of 43 and 18 amino acid residues, respectively. The repeats are combined in higher order repetitions AB1 and AB2, and these are arranged into assemblies (AB1AB1AB1AB2(AB2)AB2). We estimate that fibroin encompasses about 11 such ensemble repeats. Both the absence of any variability in the length of repeats and the high conservation of their sequence are striking. Hydrophobic residues dominate, but their stretches are broken into short motifs by intercalated polar residues. Charged amino acids are rare and occur exclusively in the repeat A. Only a few amino acid residues are occasionally replaced with others of similar properties,e.g. Leu alternates with Ile and Val, and Asp with Glu. Replacements between Gly, Ala, and Ser are also relatively common. Most variations are confined to certain positions and occur in several copies of the respective repeat. The total variation never exceeds 20%, and certain regions are identical in all copies. The short motif GLGGLG, in which L may be replaced with I, V, and exceptionally by S, is shared by all repeats (Fig.5 B). The A repeats usually contain a GVGGLG modification in positions 38–43 (numbered from the repeat beginning) and a PLGGIG modification in positions 49–54. Each B1repeat contains 3 similar motifs in positions 4–9, 15–20, and 33–38, respectively. The B2 repeat includes just one motif that is flanked by similar amino acid residues as the last such motif in B1, indicating that B2 and the second portion of B1 may have common origin. The hydrophobic motifs always alternate with short sequences containing polar residues Ser or Thr. Two similar and relatively long motifs, SSAASAAAA and SSAASAAS, are present in the A repeat and as highly altered and truncated modifications also in the B1 and B2repeats (Fig. 5 B). The hydrophobic group VIVI, which is followed by two acidic residues (in a single case, DD was changed to ND) and preceded either by PAP or AGE tripeptide, is a notable feature of the A repeat (Fig. 5 A). The H-fibroin gene of G. mellonella is composed of one very short and one very long exon (Fig. 1), as are the homologous genes in B. mori(16Zhou C.-Z. Confalonieri F. Medina N. Zivanovic Y. Esnault C. Yang T. Jacquet M. Janin J. Duguet M. Perasso R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2413-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) and A. pernyi (12Sezutsu H. Yukuhiro K. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because G. mellonellais phylogenetically rather remote from the two other species, the described arrangement of the fibroin gene is probably standard for most Lepidoptera. Sequence homologies at the 5′ and 3′ ends indicate the existence of a common ancestral H-fibroin gene. The DNA sequence of several hundreds nucleotides upstream from the transcription start was identified in the H-fibroin gene ofB. mori (29Tsujimoto Y. Suzuki Y. Cell. 1979; 18: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), Antheraea yamamai (30Tamura T. Inoue H. Suzuki Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 189-195Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar),A. pernyi (12Sezutsu H. Yukuhiro K. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and now G. mellonella. In all these cases, the upstream region is AT-rich, with frequent concatenations of up to 7 A or T nucleotides. Interspecies homology is obvious downstream from about −50 position, including the presence of a TATA box at −0 to −24 (Fig. 3 A). G. mellonella acquired, probably by coincidental mutations, another TATA box at −49 to −43. The existence of two transcription starts (standard at +1 and additional at −18) indicates strongly that both TATA boxes are functional. We cannot explain, however, why the start is at +1 in young larvae and at −18 in old larvae (Fig.2 B). Homology between H-fibroin genes of different species is very clear through the first exon, including the exon/intron boundary (Fig. 3 A). A few deletions and insertions modified the length of the leader sequence, but the following part of the first exon, which encodes the signal peptide, is remarkably preserved. The length of the intron and its internal sequence are dissimilar, but similarities between the compared species are found in the sequence of about 250 nt beginning around the intron/exon"

The importance of the structure and function of troponin T is evident in the regulated isoform expression during development and the point mutations resulting in familial hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. We report here that turkeys with inherited dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure express an unusual low molecular weight cardiac troponin T missing 11 amino acids due to the splice out of the normally conserved exon 8-encoded segment. The deletion of a 9-bp segment from intron 7 of the turkey cardiac troponin T gene may be responsible for the weakened splicing of the downstream exon 8 during mRNA processing. The exclusion of the exon 8-encoded segment results in conformational changes in cardiac troponin T, an altered binding affinity for troponin I and tropomyosin, and an increased calcium sensitivity of the actomyosin ATPase. Expression of the exon 8-deleted cardiac troponin T prior to the development of cardiomyopathy in turkeys indicates a novel RNA splicing disease and provides evidence for the role of troponin T structure-function variation in myocardial pathogenesis and heart failure.

In fast skeletal muscle TnT, alternative RNA splicing of multiple exons encoding the NH2-terminal variable region produces acidic and basic TnT isoforms exhibiting functional differences in Ca2+activation of muscle contraction (6Reiser P.J. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 449: 573-588Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J.

In contrast, the NH2-terminal region in cardiac TnT (cTnT) is less variable. Alternate RNA splicing in most avian and mammalian cTnT is limited to a single exon (exon 5) in the NH2 terminus. Inclusion or exclusion of the 10 amino acids encoded by exon 5 is developmentally regulated in all vertebrate cTnT and is responsible for the perinatal switch from the high molecular weight, more acidic embryonic isoform to the low molecular weight, less acidic adult isoform (9Cooper T.A.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)), developmental independent alternate RNA splicing of exon 4 encoding four or five amino acids also occurs resulting in the expression of two cTnT isoforms in the heart. Whereas functional differences in Ca2+ activation have also been found between these cTnT isoforms (17Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2668-2672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no other alternative splicing pathway has been observed in the NH2-terminal coding exons of cTnT. troponin bovine serum albumin cardiac troponin T dilated cardiomyopathy exclusion of exon 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay monoclonal antibody 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyvinyl alcohol myosin subfragment 1 tropomyosin troponin C troponin I troponin T wild type The NH2 terminus of TnT does not directly bind to the other regulatory proteins of the thin filament, and its role in TnT function is largely debated. The NH2 terminus of TnT can be removed (e.g. deletion of the first 45 amino acids from fast skeletal muscle TnT) without abolishing the core activity of TnT (18Pan B.-S. Gordon A.M. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12432-12438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion of the NH2-terminal region of TnT has been shown to result in a significant reduction in the maximum activation of reconstituted myofibrils (19Chandra M. Montgomery D.E. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 867-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effects on Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity of muscle contraction (7Ogut O. Granzier H. Jin J.-P. Am. J.

To explore the structure-function relationship of the NH2-terminal domain of TnT, we have shown previously (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Jin J.-P. Root D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11702-11713Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the structure of the alternatively spliced NH2-terminal region may modulate the overall conformation of TnT, causing changes in the binding affinity for Tm, TnI, and TnC. This mechanism may form the foundation for the physiological and pathological significance of the various TnT isoform expressions in the heart. The pathological effects of alterations in TnT structure and function are further demonstrated by the development of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (26Watkins H. McKenna W.J. Thierfelder L. Suk H.J. Anan R. O'Donoghue A. Spirito P. Matsumori A. Moravec C.S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 27Sweeney H.L.

These dominant mutations alter the contractility of cardiac muscle leading to different disease states by relatively minor changes in TnT function (27Sweeney H.L. Feng H.S.S. Yang Z.H. Watkins H.

Tilley L.P. Yale J. Biol. Med. 1980; 53: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar). The turkey DCM exhibits many features similar to that in human DCM and has been used as a model system in heart failure studies (32Jankus E.F. Staley N.A. Noren G.R. Harmison L.T. Research Animals in Medicine. U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D. C.1973: 53-60Google Scholar, 33Hunsaker W.G. Poult.

Although stress factors such as furazolidone treatment promote the rate of DCM development, turkey DCM clearly contains a genetic basis and exhibits a pattern of familial inheritance (34Czarnecki C.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1984; 77: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 35Einzig S. Jankus E.F. Moller J.H. Am. J. Vet.

Glass M.G. Gwathmey J.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 2212-2221Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that turkeys with inherited DCM and heart failure express an unusually low molecular weight cTnT due to an exclusion of the normally conserved exon 8-encoded segment. A deletion of 9 bp in intron 7 of the turkey cTnT gene may be responsible for the weakened splicing of the downstream exon 8. The exon 8-deleted cTnT showed changes in overall conformation and binding affinity for TnI and Tm and resulted in an increase in the calcium sensitivity of myosin ATPase. This finding demonstrates a novel RNA splicing disease and provides evidence for the role of TnT structure-function relationship in the pathogenesis of DCM and heart failure. SDS gel samples of ventricular muscle from furazolidone-induced DCM turkeys were provided by Dr. Henk Granzier (Washington State University). Young turkeys were from Nicholas Turkey Breeding Farms, Sonoma, CA, and were subjected to furazolidone treatment at 7 days of age for 2–3 weeks. Fresh muscle tissues were homogenized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% SDS. The samples were stored below −70 °C until used. After heating at 80 °C for 5 min, the total protein extracts were resolved by 14% Laemmli gel with an acrylamide-to-bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1. Resulting gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to reveal the resolved protein bands. Duplicated gels were electronically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with an anti-cTnT monoclonal antibody (mAb) (CT3) (25Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a rabbit anti-TnT polyclonal antibody RATnT (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed with high stringency using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.), washed again, and developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution as described previously (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As described previously (10Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), total turkey cardiac muscle protein extracts were analyzed by two-dimensional gel. The first dimension was isoelectric focusing in Bio-Rad mini tube gels containing pH 4–6 and pH 3.5–10 Ampholine (Amersham Biosciences) in a 4:1 ratio. After electrophoresis at 400 V for 6 h and 650 V for 1.5 h, the isoelectric focusing gel was equilibrated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min and loaded on a 14% Laemmli slab mini gel with an acrylamide-to-bisacrylamide ratio of 180:1 for the second dimension SDS-PAGE. Five min after the bromphenol blue dye front ran off the bottom edge, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to reveal the resolved protein spots or transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting as above. As described previously (38Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) total turkey ventricular muscle RNA was isolated by the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of the cardiac RNA was used to synthesize cDNA encoding cTnT by reverse transcription using an oligonucleotide primer (5′-GAGAATTCTACTTCCACCGGCCGCCCAC-3′) complementary to the exon 18 sequence of the chicken cTnT gene (9Cooper T.A. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11140-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) flanking the translation stop codon plus an EcoRI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The turkey cTnT cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the exon 18 reverse primer and a forward primer (5′-CACATATGTCGGACTCTGAAGAGGTCG-3′) synthesized corresponding to the exon 2 sequence of the chicken cTnT gene plus an NdeI restriction site (underlined) at the translation initiation codon. Resultant PCR products were cut at the NdeI and EcoRI sites built in at the ends of the cDNA and cloned into the pET17b expression plasmid vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified, and the cDNA insert was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method. Genomic DNA was prepared from the liver of domestic turkey by proteinase K digestion and phenol/CHCl3 extraction (39Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for PCR amplification of the segment containing the exon 7 to exon 10 region of the turkey cTnT gene. Sequence of the forward primer (5′-GAAGATGAAACAAAAGCACCAGGAG-3′) was chosen within the exon 7 of turkey cTnT gene. Sequence of the reverse primer (5′-GGGAGGCACCAGGTTGGGCATGA-3′) was derived from the antisense sequence of the exon 10 of turkey cTnT gene. By PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase with proofreading activity (Stratagene), a DNA fragment of ∼1.1-kb was amplified from the turkey genomic DNA (Fig. 4B). This PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, cloned into the pCR2.1 plasmid vector, and sequenced as described above. As described previously (39Huang Q.-Q. Jin J.-P. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the exon 7 to exon 10 segment of turkey cTnT gene was amplified by PCR from the cloned plasmid DNA. The corresponding region of the chicken cTnT gene was amplified by PCR directly from domestic chicken genomic DNA as described above for the cloning of the turkey cTnT genomic segment. The specific PCR product of chicken genomic DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered by the Prep-A-Gene glass beads method (Bio-Rad). Following PCR verification using an exon 8-specific internal primer versus the flanking exon 7 primer, the chicken cTnT genomic DNA fragment was re-amplified by PCR. After extraction with phenol/CHCl3 and precipitation in ethanol, the turkey and chicken genomic DNA fragments were digested with a battery of restriction endonucleases under standard conditions. Agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out to identify the restriction fragments. The wild type turkey cTnT, low molecular weight turkey cTnT, and mouse cardiac TnC (25Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were expressed from cloned cDNA and purified with slight modification of previously described methodology (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For cTnT and mouse cardiac TnC expression, BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells were transformed with the recombinant pET17b plasmid. Freshly transformed E. coli was cultured in rich liquid media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and induced at mid-log phase with isopropyl-1-thiol-β-d-galactoside. After three additional hours of culture the bacterial cells were harvested for purification. The turkey cTnTs were purified by the following method. The induced bacterial cells were washed with cold ethanol and acetone followed by protein extraction with 1 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Extracted proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the fraction between 20 and 50% saturation was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Following dialysis the fraction was brought to 6 m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, clarified by centrifugation, and chromatographed on a DE52 anion-exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0–300 mm), and the protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing turkey cTnT were dialyzed against water and concentrated by lyophilization. The cTnT was further purified to homogeneity by G-75 gel filtration chromatography in 6 m urea at pH 7.0 as described previously (38Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mouse cardiac TnC was purified as follows. The induced bacterial cells were lysed by three passes through a French press. Cellular proteins were extracted in 6 m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and fractionated on a DE52 anion-exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0–300 mm), and the protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing mouse cardiac TnC were dialyzed against water and concentrated by lyophilization. The cardiac TnT was further purified to homogeneity by G-75 gel filtration chromatography in 6 murea at pH 7.0 as described previously (38Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chicken and bovine cardiac TnI were purified from adult ventricular muscle. The tissue was homogenized in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Following a wash in the same buffer without Triton X-100, myofilament proteins were extracted with 1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 15 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Extracted proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the fraction between 20 and 50% saturation was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Following dialysis the fraction was brought to 6m urea, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm PMSF, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, clarified by centrifugation, and chromatographed on a CM52 cation-exchange column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear KCl gradient of 0–500 mm, and the protein peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing cardiac TnI were then dialyzed against 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 0.1 mm EDTA. Following concentration by lyophilization, the cardiac TnI was purified to homogeneity by G-75 gel filtration chromatography in 6 m urea, 0.5 m KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, as described previously (38Ogut O. Jin J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27858-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The pure cardiac TnI peak was identified by SDS-PAGE, dialyzed against 0.5% formic acid, and lyophilized. Rabbit cardiac Tm, skeletal muscle actin, and myosin were all purified from muscle tissue. Chicken and rabbit cardiac α-Tm were isolated as described previously (41Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) from ventricular muscle. Rabbit skeletal actin was isolated from skeletal acetone powder and prepared as described previously (10Jin J.-P. Lin J.J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following polymerization F-actin was stored in 50% glycerol at −20 °C until used. Rabbit skeletal myosin was isolated from back muscle, and myosin sub-fragment 1 (S1) was obtained by limited α-chymotrypsin digestion (42Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and frozen in small aliquots at −80 °C until used. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) epitope analysis (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was carried out to examine conformational changes in the exon 8-deleted turkey cTnT. The mAb CT3 against an epitope in the COOH-terminal domain (25Jin J.-P. Chen A. Ogut O. Huang Q.-Q. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal antibody RATnT generated against fast skeletal muscle TnT that cross-reacts to multiple epitopes on the conserved central and COOH-terminal domains of cTnT (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were used to monitor the conformational changes that alter the antibody binding affinity. Similar to that described previously (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), purified turkey cTnT was dissolved in Buffer A (0.1 M KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0) and coated on microtiter plates by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The unbound cTnT was washed away with Buffer A containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Buffer T), and the remaining plastic surface was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Buffer T. The immobilized cTnT was incubated with serial dilutions of CT3 or RATnT antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Following washes with Buffer T to remove the unbound first antibody, the plates were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin second antibody (Sigma) at room temperature for 1 h. The unbound second antibody was washed away with Buffer T and H2O2/2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) was added for substrate reaction. A405 nmof each assay well was recorded at a series of time points by an automated microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark). The A405 nm values in the linear course of the color development were used to plot the antibody titration curves for the quantification of binding affinity for the epitopes on turkey cTnT. All experiments were done in triplicate. A solid phase protein binding assay (23Wang J. Jin J.-P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14519-14528Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used to investigate the interactions of turkey cTnT with TnI and Tm. Purified wild type and exon 8-deleted turkey cTnT or BSA control was dissolved at 5 μg/ml in Buffer A and coated onto triplicate wells of micrometer plates by incubation at 4 °C overnight. After washes with Buffer T to remove the unbound protein, the plates were blocked with Buffer T containing 1% BSA. The plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of chicken cardiac TnI or α-Tm in Buffer T containing 0.1% BSA at room temperature for 2 h. After washes with Buffer T, the bound TnI or Tm was quantified via an anti-TnI mAb TnI-1 (40Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W., Yu, Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or an anti-Tm mAb CH1 (43Lin J.J.-C. Chou C.-S. Lin J.L.-C. Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 223-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), respectively, using the standard ELISA procedure described above. The troponin complex was reconstituted by mixing wild type or exon 8-deleted turkey cTnT, bovine cardiac TnI, mouse cardiac TnC, and rabbit α-Tm at molar ratio of 1:1:1.4:2 in 4.6 m urea, 1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.0. The mixture was dialyzed against the same buffer without urea, followed by a change of 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.0. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 120,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was incubated on ice for 2 h. To the Tn·Tm complex, F-actin was added to a sub-saturated molar ratio and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the reconstituted thin filaments were used for actomyosin S1 ATPase assay. The protein contents of the reconstituted thin filament were verified by 12% SDS-PAGE with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1 (40Jin J.-P. Yang F.-W., Yu, Z.-B. Ruse C.I. Bond M. Chen A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-regulated myosin S1 ATPase activity was analyzed using a modified malachite green method (44Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reconstituted thin filaments were suspended in assay buffer (6.5 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) containing various concentrations of free Ca2+ calculated as described previously (42Heeley D.H. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9971-9978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and added to the wells of a microtiter plate. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 2.5 μg of myosin S1 in assay buffer was added per well to the thin filaments, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to 0.5 mm of the 150-μl reaction. The reaction was mixed by shaking in a microtiter plate reader and allowed to proceed at room temperature for 10 min before being stopped by the addition of ammonium heptamolybdate plus sulfuric acid. After the addition of malachite green and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the inorganic phosphate produced from ATP hydrolysis was determined by absorbance at 595 nm recorded by an automated microplate reader (Bio-Rad Benchmark). The A595 nm values were plotted versus the pCa values and fit to the Hill equation (Sigma Plot) to construct the Ca2+ activation curves for the myosin S1 ATPase.

Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, well characterized as the carrier of insulin-like growth factor (IGF), has been reported to have intrinsic bioactivity that is independent of IGF binding. The mechanisms involved in this IGF-independent action are still unclear. Using the RCJ3.1C5.18 chondrogenic cells, which in culture progresses from undifferentiated to terminally differentiated chondrocytes, we have shown previously that IGFBP-3 has an IGF-independent, antiproliferative effect in undifferentiated and early differentiated but not in terminally differentiated chondrocytes. In the present study, cDNA microarray analysis was used to screen for genes: 1) that were regulated by IGFBP-3 in early but not in terminally differentiated chondrocytes; 2) that were regulated specifically by IGFBP-3, but not by IGF-I; and 3) whose regulation was abolished by coincubation of IGFBP-3 with IGF-I. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 was the gene that, fulfilling the screening criteria, exhibited the greatest up-regulation by IGFBP-3 (>40-fold). STAT-1 gene up-regulation was confirmed by Northern analysis of cells treated with IGFBP-3 or transfected with an IGFBP-3 expression vector. Remarkably, similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with an IGFBP-3 mutant unable to bind IGFs, definitively demonstrating the IGF-independent action of IGFBP-3. Consistent with the up-regulation of STAT-1 mRNA, IGFBP-3 also increased STAT-1 protein expression. Furthermore, both IGFBP-3 and the IGFBP-3 mutant induced STAT-1 phosphorylation and its nuclear localization. An antisense STAT-1 oligonucleotide abolished the IGF-independent cell apoptosis induced by IGFBP-3. We have demonstrated that STAT-1 is a major intracellular signaling and transcriptional target of the IGF-independent apoptotic effect of IGFBP-3 in chondrogenesis.

Specifically, although multiple IGF-independent binding sites have been reported, the signaling pathways and transcriptional targets related to these interactions are still poorly understood.

RCJ3.1C5.18 cells are especially suitable for this purpose. Over the 2 weeks of culture, they undergo a reproducible, time-dependent progression from chondroprogenitors to hypertrophic chondrocytes (19Grigoriadis A.E. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E.

Furthermore, RCJ3.1C5.18 cells do not express IGFs or IGFBP-3; therefore the action of these peptides can be studied without interference from endogenous molecules (18Spagnoli A. Hwa V. Horton W.A.

In the present study, we evaluate the mechanisms involved in the IGF-independent action of IGFBP-3 in chondrogenesis. In particular, our study was designed to identify IGFBP-3 target genes and intracellular signaling pathways involved in the pro-apoptotic, IGF-independent action of IGFBP-3 during the process of chondrogenesis. Recombinant nonglycosylated human IGFBP-3 expressed in Escherichia coli was generously supplied by Celtrix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Human recombinant IGF-I was purchased from GroPep Pty. Ltd. (Adelaide, Australia). Fetal bovine serum, α-minimum essential medium and sodium pyruvate were purchased from Invitrogen. Dexamethasone and β-glycerophosphate were obtained from Sigma. Ascorbic acid was obtained from Wako Pure Biochemicals Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Anti-phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 (Tyr701), anti-STAT-1, and anti-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). RCJ3.1C5.18 cells, generously donated by Dr. Jane E. Aubin (University of Toronto), were grown in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10−7 m dexamethasone, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate. The cells were plated at a density of 6 × 104 cells/well in six-well dishes. After reaching confluence (4 days), fresh growth medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate was added. The differentiating cells were fed again with supplemented medium at days 7 and 10 of culture. The cultures were monitored over a total period of 14 days. We have previously shown that RCJ3.1C5.18 cells grown in this manner maintain their differentiated chondrocytic phenotype, sequentially acquire at 7 days culture markers of early chondrocytic differentiation (type II collagen and proteoglycan synthesis), and progressively acquire at 10 and 14 days culture markers of terminal differentiation (type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase activity) (20Lunstrum G.P.

The GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant cDNA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis at residues Ile56, Leu80, and Leu81 to Gly56, Gly80, and Gly81, as described previously (21Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsén M. Bang P., Oh, Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Binding studies (including BIAcore analysis) showed that the GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant protein, generated in E. coli and baculovirus expression systems, had abolished affinity for IGFs (21Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsén M. Bang P., Oh, Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For transfection, hIGFBP-3 and GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the pCMV6 vector as described previously (21Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsén M. Bang P., Oh, Y. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded in six-well dishes and 24 h later were transfected with 4 μg of expression vector plasmid using Mirus Transit LT-1, as described by the manufacturer (PanVera, Madison, WI). IGFBP-3 and GGG-IGFBP-3 levels were measured in conditioned media of transfected cells. The media were concentrated 7–10-fold using Centricon 3 columns (Amicon, Boston, MA), and IGFBP-3 and GGG-IGFBP-3 concentrations were measured using a commercial immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) kit for hIGFBP-3 (Diagnostic System Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX). The anti-IGFBP-3 antibodies employed in the IRMA kit recognized the GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant with the affinity similar to wild-type IGFBP-3 (21Buckway C.K. Wilson E.M. Ahlsén M. Bang P., Oh, Y.

Weller D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) was designed based upon the published rat STAT-1 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF205604: 5′-GCTGAAGCTCGAACCACTGTGACAT-3′) and corresponded to the first 25 nucleotides of the STAT-1 open reading frame. The cells were seeded in six-well dishes and 24 h later were treated with or without the morpholino STAT-1 antisense oligo, using the special delivery morpholino system as described by the manufacturer (GeneTools LLC). Twenty-four hours after antisense treatment, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of expression vector plasmid (IGFBP-3, GGG-IGFBP-3, or empty vector), using Mirus Transit LT-1 as described. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were subjected to a quantitative apoptosis assay, and total RNA was obtained and subjected to Northern blot analysis for STAT-1. Total cell extracts were also obtained and subjected to Western immunoblot (WIB) analysis for phosphorylated STAT-1. Each experiment was performed twice in triplicate. 13,824 unique mouse genes available from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) were spotted in duplicate on superaldehyde-coated glass slides. Detailed descriptions of printing, processing, and data analysis procedures are available from medir.ohsu.edu/∼geneview. Ten μg of total RNA were used from indirect biotinylated probe synthesis. Each source RNA was used to screen two independent arrays. Data normalization and analysis were performed using trimmed mean approaches as described by Eisen et al. (23Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13152) Google Scholar). Detailed methods are available on the above web page. Total RNA was obtained from early differentiated (7 days of culture) and terminally differentiated chondrocytes (14 days of culture) using RNeasy columns as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). The cells were treated with IGFBP-3 (1 μg/ml), IGF-I (100 ng/ml), or IGFBP-3 (1 μg/ml) plus IGF-I (100 ng/ml) or left untreated (control) for 24 h in serum-free conditions. This experiment was performed in triplicate. Ten μg of total RNA were hybridized with DNA microarrays. The STAT-1 cDNA spotted on the microarrays (GenBankTM accession number AI449540) was generated by PCR, verified by DNA sequencing matched through BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih/BLAST/) to GenBankTM data base, and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was obtained from cells cultured for 4, 7, or 14 days and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium with or without 1 μg/ml of recombinant IGFBP-3. Total RNA was also obtained at different time point after transfection from cells transfected with expression vector plasmid (IGFBP-3, GGG-IGFBP-3, or empty vector) or left untransfected. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells, as described by the manufacturer, using RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and quantified by spectrophotometric analysis. Eight to ten μg of RNA were subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (18Spagnoli A. Hwa V. Horton W.A. Lunstrum G.P. Roberts C.T., Jr. Chiarelli F. Torello M. Rosenfeld R.G. J.

Endocrinol. 1996; 148: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The STAT-1 probe was labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP, and hybridization was performed in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Washed filters were autoradiographed, and densitometric analysis was done with a GS700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control for RNA loading. Total cell extracts were obtained at different time points after transfection from cells transfected with expression vector plasmid (IGFBP-3, GGG-IGFBP-3, or empty vector) or from untransfected cells. For preparation of total cell extracts, the cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mmsodium vanadate. Total cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein concentrations were determined (Bio-Rad). The total cell extracts (100 μg of protein) were subjected to WIB with specific primary antibodies, using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (18Spagnoli A. Hwa V. Horton W.A.

The membranes were rehybridized with an anti-p38 antibody as an internal control for the protein amount loaded. Densitometric analysis was done with a GS700 Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). The cells were seeded in six-well dishes and 24 h later were transfected with 4 μg of expression vector plasmid (IGFBP-3, GGGG-IGFBP-3, or empty vector). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at −20 °C, washed with TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), incubated for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (5.5% normal goat serum in TBST), washed with Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with anti-phospho-STAT-1 primary antibody (1:500 dilution in Tris-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin), washed, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:500 rabbit IgG in TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin) (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), washed, incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.6% hydrogen peroxide, washed, incubated 1 h at room temperature with ABC reagents (VectaStain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories Inc.), washed, and incubated with DAB reagent (0.01% hydrogen peroxide, 0.2 mg/ml diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in phosphate-buffered saline). The reaction was monitored under a microscope and was stopped with water. A cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to measure cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligo-nucleosomes) generated in the early phase of apoptosis (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The assay is based on a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay, using antibodies directed against DNA and histones. This allows the specific determination of mono- and oligo-nucleosomes, which are released into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells. The cells were seeded in six-well dishes and 24 h later were treated with or without the STAT-1 antisense oligo. Twenty-four hours after antisense treatment, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of expression vector plasmid (IGFBP-3, GGG-IGFBP-3, or empty vector). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cell lysates were prepared and subjected in duplicate to the cell death detection assay. The data are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical differences between the means were assessed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for pairwise comparisons. The statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We have previously reported that IGFBP-3 has IGF-I-independent antiproliferative action in undifferentiated and early differentiated chondrocytes but not in terminally differentiated chondrocytes (18Spagnoli A. Hwa V. Horton W.A. Lunstrum G.P. Roberts C.T., Jr. Chiarelli F. Torello M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5533-5540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because of this selective biological action of IGFBP-3, microarray gene profiling analyses were carried out to select genes: 1) that were regulated by IGFBP-3 in early but not in terminally differentiated cells; 2) whose regulation was abolished by coincubation of IGFBP-3 with IGF-I; and 3) that were regulated by IGFBP-3 but not by IGF-I. The STAT-1 fulfilled all the screening criteria that we used for the microarray analysis; among the genes that met our criteria, STAT-1 showed the highest regulation by IGFBP-3. STAT-1 up-regulation has previously been implicated in the control of cell growth and apoptosis in several cell systems, including chondrocytes (26Bromberg J. Darnell J.E., Jr. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). The STAT-1 gene was up-regulated by IGFBP-3 in early differentiated cells (Fig. 1) by more than 40-fold compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 1 B). Spot analysis (Fig. 1 A) and pairwise sample over control (untreated cells) ratio analysis (Fig. 1 B) indicated that, in early differentiated cells, the up-regulation of the STAT-1 gene expression by IGFBP-3 was abolished by coincubation with IGF-I. IGF-I itself did not change STAT-1 gene expression, and IGFBP-3 did not have any effect on STAT-1 gene expression in terminally differentiated cells (Fig. 1). To confirm the results of the microarray analysis, we performed Northern blot analysis for STAT-1. As shown in Fig. 2, in undifferentiated (4 days of culture) and early differentiated (7 days of culture) cells, IGFBP-3 treatment resulted in a marked increase in STAT-1 mRNA. In terminally differentiated cells (14 days of culture), IGFBP-3 did not affect STAT-1 gene expression (Fig. 2). Effects similar to those observed in cells treated with exogenously added IGFBP-3 were seen in undifferentiated chondroprogenitors transfected with expression vectors encoding wild-type IGFBP-3 or the IGFBP-3 mutant with abolished affinity for IGFs (GGG-IGFBP-3). Thus, both IGFBP-3 and GGG-IGFBP-3 produced a marked increase in STAT-1 mRNA (Fig. 3) compared with untransfected cells or cells transfected with the empty vector. IGFBP-3 and GGG-IGFBP-3 had a prolonged effect on STAT-1 gene expression (up to 24 h after transfection).Figure 3Transfection of chondroprogenitors with IGFBP-3 or GGG-IGFBP-3 expression vectors induces STAT-1 mRNA. Total RNA was obtained from chondroprogenitor cells transfected with IGFBP-3 or the GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant expression vectors, transfected with the control vector containing no cDNA insert (Empty vector), or left untransfected (Untransf).

As shown in Fig. 4, IGFBP-3 increased total STAT-1 protein compared with untransfected cells or cells transfected with empty vector. IGFBP-3 had a prolonged effect on total STAT-1 protein (up to 24 h after transfection). Similarly to IGFBP-3, the GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant increased total STAT-1 protein (Fig. 5). The conditioned media of cells transfected with IGFBP-3 or GGG-IGFBP-3 expression vectors contained up to 70 ng/ml IGFBP-3 and 60 ng/ml GGG-IGFBP-3, respectively.Figure 5Effect of GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant on STAT-1 total by WIB analysis.

The effect of IGFBP-3 on STAT-1 phosphorylation was observed up to 24 h after transfection (Fig. 6). Similarly to IGFBP-3, the GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant increased STAT-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7), with a similar prolonged effect.Figure 7GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant induces STAT-1 phosphorylation by WIB analysis.

As shown in Fig. 8, transfection with IGFBP-3 resulted in the nuclear localization of phosphorylated STAT-1, whereas only a faint signal for phosphorylated STAT-1 was seen in the cytoplasm of untransfected cells or cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 8).

Therefore, we decided to investigate whether STAT-1 has a functional role in the IGFBP-3-induced pro-apoptotic effect in chondroprogenitors. We used a STAT-1 antisense oligonucleotide to inhibit the endogenous expression of STAT-1. As shown in Fig. 9, IGFBP-3 induced apoptosis in chondroprogenitors. Similar results were obtained if chondroprogenitors were transfected with GGG-IGFBP-3 mutant, therefore demonstrating that IGFBP-3 has an IGF-independent pro-apoptotic action in chondroprogenitors. If cells were treated 24 h before transfection with STAT-1 antisense, the level of apoptosis induced by either IGFBP-3 or GGG-mutant was significantly reduced to the level observed in cells treated with the empty vector or in untransfected cells (control). The STAT-1 antisense reduced the level"

Previous studies have shown that the ClpB protein is needed for bacterial thermotolerance. Purified ClpB protein has been shown to reactivate chemically and heat-denatured proteins. In this work we demonstrate that the combined action of ClpB and the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones leads to the activation of DNA replication of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2. In contrast, ClpB is not needed for the activation of the oriC-dependent replication of E. coli. Using purified protein components we show that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE synergistic action activates the plasmid RK2 replication initiation protein TrfA by converting inactive dimers to an active monomer form. In contrast, Hsp78/Ssc1/Mdj1/Mge1, the corresponding protein system from yeast mitochondria, cannot activate the TrfA replication protein. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system is involved in protein monomerization and in the activation of a DNA replication factor.

Based on the growth defect phenotype of E. coli clpB mutants, it has been proposed that ClpB is involved in thermotolerance (3Squires C. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J.

In agreement with this, thermally aggregated proteins were shown to be disaggregated in wild-type cells but not in a clpB mutant strain upon a shift to lower temperature (5Laskowska E.

Other members of the Hsp100/Clp protein family, namely the E. coli proteins ClpA, ClpX, and ClpY, have been shown to be involved in the ATP-dependent protein degradation through a transient association with the catalytic protease components ClpP and ClpQ (ClpP for ClpX and ClpA; ClpQ for ClpY) (11Wawrzynow A.

Previous work has shown that the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 can replicate and maintain itself in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria (19Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 1-25Google Scholar). This property has made RK2 a particularly interesting system for studying fundamental questions about the cellular processes involved in DNA replication. Only two factors required for RK2 replication are encoded by the plasmid DNA: (i) the replication origin (oriV) sequence consisting of five iterons (17-bp iterated sequences) (20Stalker D.M. Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and four DnaA boxes (9-bp DnaA protein binding sites) (21Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and (ii) the plasmid replication initiation protein TrfA (22Durland R.H.

Other of the proteins required for plasmid DNA replication are supplied by the bacterial host (25Pinkney M. Diaz R. Lanka E. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in a purified system that the DnaA initiation protein, DnaB helicase, DnaC, DNA gyrase, DnaG primase, SSB, HU, and Pol III proteins of E. coli are required for RK2 replication (26Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The binding of the TrfA protein to the iteron sequences is the most crucial step during RK2 replication initiation. Only the monomeric form of the TrfA protein can bind to the iteron sequences and initiate DNA replication (27Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The binding of TrfA in the presence of HU results in strand opening in the AT-rich oriV region, specifically at the four 13-mers present within this region (21Konieczny I. Doran K.S. Helinski D.R. Blasina A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20173-20178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This open structure serves as the entry site for the DnaB helicase complex, thus leading to initiation of DNA replication (26Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The TrfA initiation protein exists in two forms, 44-kDa and 33-kDa, as a result of an internal translational start in the trfA gene (22Durland R.H. Toukdarian A. Fang F. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kornacki J.A. West A.H. Firshein W. Plasmid. 1984; 11: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Shingler V. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 229-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been shown that either protein can function in DNA replication in E. coli. However, the 44-kDa TrfA is indispensable during RK2 replication initiation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24Shingler V. Thomas C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 229-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Durland R.H. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1987; 18: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Fang F.C. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5861-5868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the purified TrfA protein is found largely in the dimeric form, it binds iteron sequences as a monomer (30Perri S.

The involvement of the chaperone protein ClpX in the activation of TrfA for iteron binding and consequently for initiating oriV replication has been previously studied in detail (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the ClpX chaperone protein can convert TrfA dimers into active monomers in vitro. In previous work, evidence was obtained that in addition to ClpX other chaperone(s) may also play a role in TrfA activation in E. coli (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated that ClpB in combination with DnaK chaperone system plays a major role in the replication of the RK2 plasmid. Our work is in contrast with studies with plasmid P1 where it was shown in vitro that the replication initiation protein of this plasmid can be activated to a monomer form by either the DnaK chaperone machinery alone or the ClpA protein alone (12Wickner S.

Unlike the wild-type, the mutant protein is present largely in the form of the monomer, which is the active form of TrfA for binding to the iterons at the RK2 replication origin (27Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Perri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Plasmids pTJS42 and pKD19L1 carrying the minimal RK2 origin region and plasmid pBSoriC carrying the oriC DNA origin fragment have been previously described (41Doran K.S. Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8447-8453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,46Schmidhauser T.J. Filutowicz M. Helinski D.R. Plasmid. 1983; 9: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HU, SSB, and DNA gyrase proteins were obtained from Enzyco, Inc., creatine kinase, bovine serum albumin (Fraction V), creatine phosphate, and rNTPs from Sigma, dNTPs from Pharmacia, [methyl-3H]dTTP from ICN Radiochemicals, and goat anti-rabbit IgG from Bio-Rad. Preparation of E. coli crude extracts (FII) and reaction conditions were essentially as previously described (47Kittell B.L. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1389-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The standard reactions contained 300 ng of plasmid template and histidine-tagged versions of wild-type 33-kDa TrfA or the largely monomeric preparations of the 33-kDa TrfA mutant protein TrfA 254D/267L (42Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Gene. 1998; 223: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) at the indicated concentrations. For oriC-dependent reactions, the pBSoriC template was used, and the TrfA protein was omitted. Incubation was at 32 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and total nucleotide incorporation (pmol) was measured by liquid scintillation counting following filtration onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. Helicase unwinding assays (FI* formation) were performed as previously described (26Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plasmid pKD19L1 (300 ng) or pTJS42 (300 ng), containing the RK2 replication origin, was used in the DNA template. Unless noted otherwise, proteins were added at the following amounts: DnaA (320 ng), DnaB (600 ng), DnaC (120 ng), TrfA 254D/267L (500 ng), HU (5 ng), gyrase (120 ng), and SSB (230 ng). To analyze the monomeric and dimeric forms of TrfA protein, glycerol gradient centrifugation was performed essentially as described in (48Liberek K. Galitski T.P. Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (60 μl) with proteins in buffer were assembled on ice and contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% sucrose, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 11 mm magnesium acetate, and 2 mm ATP. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 32 °C and then loaded onto a 3.2-ml linear 15–35% (v/v) glycerol gradient in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 4 mmdithiothreitol) and centrifuged at 46,000 rpm for 24h at 2 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Fractions were collected from the top of the tube and analyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by protein transfer and immunoblotting with rabbit antisera against the TrfA protein. Bound rabbit antibody was detected by a colorimetric reaction with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Previously published in vitro results demonstrated that the plasmid RK2 replication initiation protein TrfA can be activated by a chaperone (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ClpX, the molecular chaperone in the ATP-dependent reaction, converts TrfA dimers to active monomers. In agreement, the mutant protein TrfA 254D/267L, which exists mainly in monomeric form does not require the presence of ClpX for replication activity. Because we were not able to observe a significant effect of the deletion of the clpX gene on the maintenance of the RK2 plasmid in E. coli, we previously proposed that other chaperone system(s) are also involved in TrfA activation (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the previous analysis of RK2 DNA replication in protein extracts prepared from E. coli strains carrying mutations in different chaperones (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), ClpB was found to be the most attractive candidate. The effect of ClpB on the initiation of DNA replication was tested using a bacterial crude extract replication system (see “Materials and Methods”). Extracts obtained either from wild-type E. coli cells or the clpB deletion mutant were used in two different replication reactions. The first one,oriV-dependent, utilizes the plasmid RK2 minimal replication origin and the plasmid replication initiation protein TrfA. The second one, oriC-dependent, represents DNA replication from the E. coli minimal replication origin dependent on the presence of the DnaA initiation protein.oriV DNA replication activity in crude Fraction II extracts prepared from the clpB-deficient strain was significantly lower (80% reduction) when compared with the same reaction carried out in extracts prepared from wild-type bacteria (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the absence of ClpB in the crude extract had only a limited effect on oriC DNA replication (25% reduction). We also analyzed the effect of the addition of purified ClpB protein to the oriV and oriC replication reactions using crude Fraction II extracts prepared from the E. coli clpB-deficient strain (Fig. 1, B and C). In the presence of ClpB, the level of oriV-dependent replication increased 2-fold (Fig. 1B). In contrast, oriC DNA replication was somewhat diminished (Fig. 1C). The reduction in oriC replication observed in these experiments may be due to the nonspecific disaggregation of particular replication machinery components. A similar nonspecific decrease in the DNA replication has been observed during experiments with the monomeric form of the TrfA protein (Fig. 2B). Overall the results indicate that plasmid RK2 DNA replication but not bacterial DNA replication is activated by the ClpB chaperone. Using the oriV-dependent in vitro replication system and utilizing crude Fraction II extracts prepared from the E. coli clpB mutant, we investigated the replication activity of the 33-kDa dimeric wild-type TrfA protein and the TrfA monomeric mutant TrfA 254D/267L. After purification, the 33-kDa TrfA wild-type protein is found mainly in a dimeric form. However, it is the TrfA monomeric form that binds iterons within the RK2 replication origin and initiates DNA replication (30Perri S. Helinski D.R. Toukdarian A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7072-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was found that the replication activity of wild-type TrfA in crude extracts prepared from the E. coli clpB mutant strain was significantly reduced in comparison to the activity of monomeric TrfA 254D/267L (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Experiments performed in the course of this work are consistent with the previous observation. The addition of the purified ClpB chaperone to the replication mixture containing dimeric TrfA protein increased the level of replication 3-fold as compared with the reaction without ClpB (Fig. 2A). The observed level of replication activity of wild-type TrfA in the absence of ClpB protein is due to activation by the ClpX chaperone that is present in the bacterial extract (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Also, possibly other not yet identified chaperones that are present in the extract, bring about a limited amount of activation of the wild-type TrfA protein. In contrast, the TrfA 254D/267L-dependent replication was not activated by the addition of ClpB. Instead, a slight reduction of DNA synthesis was observed (Fig. 2B). The experiments with both wild-type TrfA and monomeric TrfA 254D/267L were performed at low and high TrfA concentrations (Fig. 2). The results obtained were very similar, showing that ClpB-dependent stimulation of replication is observed only with wild-type TrfA regardless of its concentration. The crude Fraction II extract used for oriC and RK2 replication contains not only DNA replication proteins but also other cellular components including ClpX and other molecular chaperones. To investigate whether ClpB acts by itself or in combination with other intracellular factors, we measured the activation of TrfA in a system reconstituted with purified proteins. It was previously published that the replication activity of TrfA can be determined by analyzing FI* formation, an extensively unwound covalently closed circular DNA replication intermediate (26Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33312-33318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In a control reaction when TrfA 254D/267L was used, FI* formation was easily detectable in the absence of chaperone proteins (Fig. 3, lane 2). The addition of dimeric wild-type TrfA did not result in template conversion to the FI* form (Fig. 3, lane 3). Surprisingly, the addition of the ClpB chaperone to this reaction mixture did not facilitate FI* formation indicating that additional cellular components are required to activate TrfA. Recently, it has been demonstrated that ClpB cooperates with the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery in the refolding of stable protein aggregates (7Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P.B. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 8Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that ClpB might cooperate with the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones in plasmid RK2 replication activation. The addition of purified ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones to the reaction mixture containing wild-type TrfA,oriV template, and the other required components resulted in FI* formation, presumably because of activation of the TrfA protein (Fig. 3, lane 6). The addition of ClpB alone or the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones alone was not sufficient for TrfA activation (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). We characterized in detail the requirements for individual chaperone machinery components in the TrfA activation reaction. Experiments with omissions of one or two chaperone proteins were performed (Fig. 4). Clearly, the full system, using all four chaperones was the most efficient (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 11). FI* formation was slightly reduced when GrpE was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 4, lane 5). The absence of DnaJ resulted in a large reduction of FI* formation but did not abolished it (Fig. 4, lane 4). In contrast, the presence of both DnaK (Fig. 4, lane 3) and ClpB (Fig. 3, lane 5) is indispensable for TrfA activation. In the absence of both DnaJ and GrpE, reduced TrfA activation was observed (Fig. 4, lane 8). These results clearly show that ClpB and DnaK are the most crucial components; however, TrfA activation is most efficient when the ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins are all present. We also tested whether the E. coli DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery affects RK2 replication in crude extracts. The addition of antibodies against DnaK substantially reduced the RK2 replication using wild-type TrfA and bacterial crude extracts (Fig. 3B). In contrast the same reaction with monomeric TrfA 254D/267L was not significantly affected (data not shown). Addition of DnaK protein substantially compensates the inhibitory effect of DnaK antibody (Fig. 3B). RK2 is a broad-host-range plasmid able to transfer and replicate its DNA in a wide spectrum of Gram-negative bacteria (19Thomas C.M. Helinski D.R. Thomas C.M. Promiscous Plasmids of Gram-negative Bacteria. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989: 1-25Google Scholar). In contrast, RK2 DNA can be transformed to, but is not stably maintained in, Gram-positive bacteria and Saccharomyces sp. (50Heinemann J.A. Sprague G.F., Jr. Nature. 1989; 340: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is an attractive candidate system for investigating the substrate specificity of various chaperones from various organisms. Purification of the Hsp78, Ssc1, Mdj1, and Mge1 yeast mitochondrial homologs of E. coli ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins, allowed us to address the question regarding host specificity for the chaperone-mediated activation of TrfA protein. We analyzed FI* formation after addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chaperone proteins to the reaction with wild-type TrfA. The results presented in Fig. 5, showed that in contrast to the E. coli system, the yeast Hsp78/Ssc1/Mdj1/Mge1 homologous system was not sufficient for TrfA activation (compare lanes 3 and 4). In contrast to the TrfA activation, both the bacterial and yeast chaperone proteins were capable of reactivation of chemically denatured luciferase (data not shown). The experiments using the analysis of FI* formation clearly showed that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system activates RK2 DNA replication initiated by the largely dimeric TrfA protein. Moreover, it was shown that only dimers of wild-type TrfA, but not monomeric form (TrfA 254D/267L) require chaperone activation. Using glycerol gradient sedimentation we analyzed the TrfA quaternary structure before and after incubation with ClpB, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE. In control experiments, in the absence of chaperone proteins, TrfA was detected in fractions corresponding to the position of the dimeric form of the protein (approximate molecular mass of 74.8 kDa)(Fig. 6A). When TrfA was incubated in the presence of the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones prior to centrifugation, the TrfA protein was found in fractions corresponding to the size of a monomer (approximate molecular mass of 37.4 kDa) since very little, if any, TrfA protein was detected in the fraction corresponding to that of the TrfA dimer (Fig. 6B). The conversion of TrfA dimers to monomers appears to be very efficient. After sedimentation, any residual protein in the bottom of each tube was solubilized with 10% SDS to analyze for the presence of aggregated proteins. Insignificant amounts of pelleted protein were found (data not shown). A surprising observation made during the past few years is that many of the plasmid-encoded proteins that specifically recognize the origin of replication bind to their corresponding DNA sites as monomer (51Konieczny I. Zylicz M. Setlow J.K. Genetics Engineering. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 95-111Google Scholar). Yet, the purified protein is found mainly in the inactive dimeric form. The pioneering studies of Wickner et al. (34Wickner S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) demonstrated in vitro that the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery is capable of monomerization of the dimeric RepA replication protein of plasmid P1. These studies were motivated by earlier in vivo observations, demonstrating that mutations in either dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE resulted in plasmid P1 instability (52Tilly K. Sozhamannan S. Yarmolinsky M. New Biol. 1990; 2: 812-817PubMed Google Scholar, 53Tilly K. Yarmolinsky M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work demonstrated that in addition to DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE the ClpA chaperone alone is capable of monomerizing the P1 RepA protein (12Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Our previous studies had uncovered an analogous reaction, i.e. the monomerization of the RK2 replication protein. In our original study the ClpX chaperone protein was shown to be sufficient for the monomerization of the TrfA replication protein (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An accompanying result in this study was the fact that the clpX deletion mutation was unaffected in the maintenance of the RK2 plasmid. The work described here was motivated not only by this observation, but also by our previous demonstration of a substantial reduction in TrfA activity in replication assays performed in crude extracts prepared from an E. coli clpB mutant strain (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, suggestions of the possible involvement of ClpB in DNA replication come also from investigations of the bacteriophage Mu replication system. 1T. Baker, personal communication. Our results clearly showed that indeed ClpB is involved in TrfA activation. ClpB was sufficient to stimulate RK2 replication in crude extracts prepared from clpB mutant that also contained other chaperones (Figs. 1 and 2). Experiments with a fully reconstituted system, where all components were added in purified form (Figs.3A and 4), revealed that in addition to ClpB other factors are required in TrfA activation. We found that, in addition to ClpB, the DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE chaperones are necessary for this reaction. The TrfA activation was shown to be the consequence of the conversion of its dimeric form to an active monomeric one. In agreement with this conclusion the TrfA 254D/267L mutant did not require the presence of either ClpB or the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperones for activity in the in vitro replication system. Our results showing that these two chaperone systems cooperate are consistent with recently published observations. It was demonstrated that in vitro E. coli ClpB together with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE facilitate the disaggregation of stable protein aggregates (7Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P.B. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21107-21113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The exact role of particular proteins in this bi-chaperone system as well as molecular events in the reaction are not clear. A sequential mechanism with ClpB initially binding to the substrate protein, followed by Hsp70 protein action, was postulated (7Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P.B. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The function of ClpB has been defined to some extent. Based on the growth defect phenotype of E. coli clpB mutants, it has been proposed that ClpB is a factor involved in thermotolerance (3Squires C. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kitagawa M. Wada C. Yoshioka S. Yura T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4247-4253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thermally aggregated proteins were shown to be dissolved in wild-type cells but not in a clpB mutant strain upon shifting the cells to lower temperature (5Laskowska E. Kuczynska-Wisnik D. Skorko-Glonek J. Taylor A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 6Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Ruediger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Our observation that the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE bi-chaperone system plays a role in plasmid RK2 DNA replication initiation defines a novel function of ClpB. Thus, the ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system is involved not only in solubilization and refolding of protein aggregates induced by heat or other stress conditions (6Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Ruediger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), but also, like certain other chaperone systems (12Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6025-6029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is involved in the activation of a DNA replication factor. Detailed analysis showed that all four proteins from the bi-chaperone system are needed for efficient TrfA activation; however, limited activation could still be obtained when GrpE and/or DnaJ were omitted (Fig. 4). Thus, the ClpB and DnaK chaperones are the key elements of the activation system. Interestingly, in contrast to P1 plasmid replication, the Hsp70 machinery alone is not able to activate the RK2 replication initiation protein. Also, TrfA could not be converted to the active form solely by the action of ClpB. This reveals an important difference between the ClpB and ClpX chaperone function. The ClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system displays specificity for the RK2 plasmid replication system. We did not observe a significant effect of ClpB on replication initiation from oriC. Previous genetic and biochemical evidence had suggested that molecular chaperones could be involved in bacterial chromosomal DNA replication. For example, it had been demonstrated in vitro that either DnaK or GroEL/ES chaperones, in the presence of ATP, can protect the DnaA protein from aggregation. Furthermore, DnaA aggregates could be dissociated by DnaK, thus allowing the initiation of oriC DNA replication in vitro (54Banecki B. Kaguni J.M. Marszalek J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 55Hwang D.S. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19244-19248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments we observe only limited reduction in oriC-dependent DNA replication in crude Fraction II extracts prepared from the E. coli clpB mutant. This suggests that the ClpB chaperone is not an essential factor for DnaA protein activation. Further investigations must be performed to verify this preliminary conclusion. It is likely that the TrfA protein, as the replication initiation factor of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2, requires the chaperone system for activation in diverse bacterial species. It has been proposed that TrfA activation in so many distantly related species can be performed by redundant chaperone systems (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We further speculate that in E. coli ClpB-dependent TrfA activation plays a more important role than ClpX-dependent activation since replication in FII extract prepared from a clpB-deleted strain is more impaired than that from a clpX deletion strain (33Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The chaperone requirements for activation of TrfA possibly vary depending on the bacterial species. On the other hand homologous chaperone systems isolated from diverse organisms can perform the same biological reactions utilizing the same substrates. For example, heat- or chemically denatured firefly luciferase is a substrate for reactivation by the E. coliClpB/DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, yeast mitochondrial Hsp78/Ssc1p/Mdj1p/Mge1p chaperones as well as cytosolic Hsp104/Ssa1p/Ydj1p (8Zolkiewski M.

Our results show that TrfA is activated by bacterial but not by yeast chaperones. Interestingly, RK2 DNA can be transferred to, but not maintained, in Gram-positive bacteria and Saccharomyces sp.

https://openalex.org/W1979877057,"Using long-duration, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we found that the magnetic dipole field generated by a dynamo action in a rotating spherical shell repeatedly reverses its polarity at irregular intervals (that is, punctuated reversal). Although the total convection energy and magnetic energy alternate between a high-energy state and a low-energy state, the dipole polarity can reverse only at high-energy states where the north-south symmetry of the convection pattern is broken and the columnar vortex structure becomes vulnerable. Another attractive finding is that the quadrupole mode grows, exceeding the dipole mode before the reversal; this may help to explain how Earth's magnetic field reverses."

Many extracellular signals stimulate the hydrolysis of PIP2 by the activation of PLC-γ1, which produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol.

Upon growth factor stimulation, the NH2-terminal PH domain of PLC-γ1 is targeted to the plasma membrane and binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) but not to PIP2(25Falasca M.

In an effort to identify the PH domain ligands and to understand the phosphoinositide regulation mechanism of PLC-γ1, we used the GST·PH fusion protein system. We found that a split half of the PH domain of PLC-γ1 directly binds to EF-1α, which is known for PI-4 kinase activating protein in plants (26Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F.

There is, however, no report on the roles of EF-1α as a PI-4 kinase activator in mammalian cells, so our present data are the first demonstration of the roles of eukaryotic EF-1α in mammalian phosphoinositide metabolism. In addition to the involvement of protein translation (28Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. Merrick W.C. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1992; 359: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we describe that EF-1α directly binds to the PH domain to activate PLC-γ1.DISCUSSIONMany reports have described the activation mechanisms and functional roles of PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling. Generally, growth factor stimulation leads to the binding of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 to the autophosphorylated receptor, and then PLC-γ1 is subsequently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-783 followed by PIP2 hydrolysis to IP3 and diacylglycerol. However, the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 does not correlate well with its enzyme activity. For example, some ligands strongly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 with low IP3 production (6Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis G. Kim C.K. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and some ligands highly induce the production of IP3 with weak tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (7Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). There might be alternative controlling mechanism(s) of PLC-γ1 activity in cellular signaling. To identify a responsible molecule(s) for regulation of PLC-γ1, we have searched for binding proteins to PLC-γ1 and found EF-1α, a PI-4 kinase activator.We showed that an NH2-terminal split PH domain of PLC-γ1 specifically binds to EF-1α and that PIP2, a substrate of PLC-γ1, increases its association with EF-1α. It is noteworthy that the strict region of PLC-γ1 plays a role for protein-protein interaction other than the SH2 and SH3 domains in PLC-γ1. Although extensive studies on the role of the PH domains were done in PLC-β (17Razzini G. Brancaccio A. Lemmon M.A. Guarnier S. Falasca M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22761-22767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), those of a split PH domain of PLC-γ1 had not been examined. By pull-down experiments with GST·nPH2 using a detergent lysate of NIH 3T3 cells, EF-1α was identified by peptide sequence analysis. The association between the nPH2 domain and EF-1α is highly specific. Since EF-1α has been reported to be an activating protein of PI-4 kinase (26Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is meaningful that the association might play a critical role for PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling.The addition of PIP2, a PLC-γ1 substrate, to the incubation mixture of the GST·nPH2 domain fusion protein and cell extracts containing EF-1α, the complex formation of GST·nPH2·EF-1α, was dramatically increased in a PIP2 concentration-dependent manner. On this point, it is interesting that the stable complex between PLC-γ1 and its substrate PIP2 was detected by Dot-blot analysis (Fig. 4). Therefore, we can speculate that the PH domain of PLC-γ1 associates with PIP2 first, and the PH domain/PIP2complex formation induces the conformational change to allow EF-1α to bind PLC-γ1. EF-1α binding to PLC-γ1 might facilitate the hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLC-γ1. In this context, the role of PLC-γ1-bound EF-1α is a possible regulator for PIP2hydrolysis.The activation of PLC-γ1 activity by EF-1α showed a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 6). The maximum activity was at around a 1:2 molar ratio, whereas the activity decreased to basal level at higher than 1:8 molar ratios. There might be several reasons to explain the bell-shaped curve. One is that EF-1α has a very basic isoelectric point and is easily aggregated at high density (43Edmonds B.T. Bell A. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Leyh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10288-10295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Carvalho M. Carvalho J. Merrick W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that component(s) such as Ca2+/CaM molecules are contaminated in EF-1α preparation. Although the preparation of tEF-1α is highly pure, the contamination of Ca2+/CaM molecules or other components could not be completely excluded. Generally, EF-1α preparation contains Ca2+/CaM molecules to some extent (40Kaur K.J. Ruben L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23045-23050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Numata O. Kurasawa Y. Gonda K. Watanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this regard, Ca2+/CaM might sequester Ca2+ supplements for maximal PLC-γ1 activity at high doses of EF-1α addition.EF-1α promotes the production of PIP and PIP2 by the activation of PI-4 kinase, and eventually this newly produced PIP2 hydrolysis is also accelerated by EF-1α via PLC-γ1 activation. EF-1α activates both PI-4 kinase (26Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PLC-γ1, which can bind to PIP and PIP2. However, they regulate the level of PIP and PIP2 in a different manner. The former regulates the level of PIP and PIP2 by phosphorylation of PI at the D-4 position of the inositol ring, whereas the latter regulates the phospholipid level by hydrolyzing PIP2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol. Therefore, EF-1α has the potential to induce a rapid PI turnover in a cell.In vivo, the complex of PLC-γ1·EF-1α was detected by immunoprecipitation not only from quiescent cells but also from epidermal growth factor- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells, and so far no significant difference was observed between them. However, using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, serum, and lysophosphatidic acid increased their complex formation around the cell membrane. 2C. J.-S. Chang, H. Seok, T.-K. Kwon, D. S.

Although we need more detailed analysis for the PLC-γ1 activation mechanism, our results show a direct interaction between PLC-γ1 and EF-1α that elucidates the phospholipid metabolisms induced by PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling.

By pull-down experiments with GST·nPH2 using a detergent lysate of NIH 3T3 cells, EF-1α was identified by peptide sequence analysis. The association between the nPH2 domain and EF-1α is highly specific. Since EF-1α has been reported to be an activating protein of PI-4 kinase (26Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3852-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is meaningful that the association might play a critical role for PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling.The addition of PIP2, a PLC-γ1 substrate, to the incubation mixture of the GST·nPH2 domain fusion protein and cell extracts containing EF-1α, the complex formation of GST·nPH2·EF-1α, was dramatically increased in a PIP2 concentration-dependent manner. On this point, it is interesting that the stable complex between PLC-γ1 and its substrate PIP2 was detected by Dot-blot analysis (Fig. 4). Therefore, we can speculate that the PH domain of PLC-γ1 associates with PIP2 first, and the PH domain/PIP2complex formation induces the conformational change to allow EF-1α to bind PLC-γ1. EF-1α binding to PLC-γ1 might facilitate the hydrolysis of PIP2 by PLC-γ1. In this context, the role of PLC-γ1-bound EF-1α is a possible regulator for PIP2hydrolysis.The activation of PLC-γ1 activity by EF-1α showed a bell-shaped curve (Fig. 6). The maximum activity was at around a 1:2 molar ratio, whereas the activity decreased to basal level at higher than 1:8 molar ratios. There might be several reasons to explain the bell-shaped curve. One is that EF-1α has a very basic isoelectric point and is easily aggregated at high density (43Edmonds B.T. Bell A. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Leyh T.S. J. Biol.

Although the preparation of tEF-1α is highly pure, the contamination of Ca2+/CaM molecules or other components could not be completely excluded. Generally, EF-1α preparation contains Ca2+/CaM molecules to some extent (40Kaur K.J. Ruben L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23045-23050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Numata O.

In this regard, Ca2+/CaM might sequester Ca2+ supplements for maximal PLC-γ1 activity at high doses of EF-1α addition.EF-1α promotes the production of PIP and PIP2 by the activation of PI-4 kinase, and eventually this newly produced PIP2 hydrolysis is also accelerated by EF-1α via PLC-γ1 activation. EF-1α activates both PI-4 kinase (26Yang W. Burkhart W. Cavallius J. Merrick W.C. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 392-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yang W. Boss W.F. J. Biol.

The former regulates the level of PIP and PIP2 by phosphorylation of PI at the D-4 position of the inositol ring, whereas the latter regulates the phospholipid level by hydrolyzing PIP2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol. Therefore, EF-1α has the potential to induce a rapid PI turnover in a cell.In vivo, the complex of PLC-γ1·EF-1α was detected by immunoprecipitation not only from quiescent cells but also from epidermal growth factor- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells, and so far no significant difference was observed between them. However, using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins, serum, and lysophosphatidic acid increased their complex formation around the cell membrane. 2C. J.-S. Chang, H. Seok, T.-K. Kwon, D. S.

Although we need more detailed analysis for the PLC-γ1 activation mechanism, our results show a direct interaction between PLC-γ1 and EF-1α that elucidates the phospholipid metabolisms induced by PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling. Many reports have described the activation mechanisms and functional roles of PLC-γ1 in cellular signaling. Generally, growth factor stimulation leads to the binding of the SH2 domains of PLC-γ1 to the autophosphorylated receptor, and then PLC-γ1 is subsequently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-783 followed by PIP2 hydrolysis to IP3 and diacylglycerol. However, the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 does not correlate well with its enzyme activity. For example, some ligands strongly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 with low IP3 production (6Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis G. Kim C.K. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and some ligands highly induce the production of IP3 with weak tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (7Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). There might be alternative controlling mechanism(s) of PLC-γ1 activity in cellular signaling. To identify a responsible molecule(s) for regulation of PLC-γ1, we have searched for binding proteins to PLC-γ1 and found EF-1α, a PI-4 kinase activator. We showed that an NH2-terminal split PH domain of PLC-γ1 specifically binds to EF-1α and that PIP2, a substrate of PLC-γ1, increases its association with EF-1α. It is noteworthy that the strict region of PLC-γ1 plays a role for protein-protein interaction other than the SH2 and SH3 domains in PLC-γ1. Although extensive studies on the role of the PH domains were done in PLC-β (17Razzini G. Brancaccio A. Lemmon M.A. Guarnier S. Falasca M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1990186184,"We have shown that ethanol induces translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the nucleus, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, and cAMP response element-mediated gene transcription in NG108-15 cells. However, little is known about which PKA types regulate this process. We show here that under basal conditions NG108-15 cells contain type I PKA (CβRIβ) primarily in cytosol and type II PKA (CαRIIβ) in the particulate and nuclear fractions. Antagonists of both type I and type II PKA inhibit forskolin- and ethanol-induced cAMP response element-mediated gene transcription. However, only the type II PKA antagonist inhibits forskolin-induced Cα and ethanol-induced Cα and RIIβ translocation to the nucleus and CREB phosphorylation; the type I antagonist is without effect. Our data suggest that forskolin- and ethanol-induced CREB phosphorylation and gene activation are differentially mediated by the two types of PKA. We propose that type II PKA is translocated and activated in the nucleus and induces CREB phosphorylation that is necessary but not sufficient for gene transcription. By contrast, type I PKA is activated in the cytoplasm, turning on a downstream pathway that activates other transcription cofactors that interact with phosphorylated CREB to induce gene transcription."

Reverse transcriptase-PCR studies showed that two new alternatively spliced forms of chicken galectin-3, termed Gal-3TM1 and Gal-3TR1, were enriched and preferentially expressed in highly purified chicken osteoclast-like cells. Gal-3TM1 and Gal-3TR1 mRNA were also detected in chicken intestinal tissue, but not in kidney, liver, or lung. Gal-3TM1 and Gal-3TR1 messages both contain an open reading frame encoding a predicted 70-amino acid TM1 sequence inserted between the N-terminal Gly/Pro repeat domain and the carbohydrate recognition domain (exons 3 and 4). Gal-3TR1 mRNA contains an additional 241-bp sequence, which encodes a truncated open reading frame between the 4th and 5th exons, and, whose translation is expected to terminate within the carbohydrate recognition domain encompassing exons 4, 5, and 6. Immunoblotting and affinity chromatography showed that purified osteoclast preparations and intestinal homogenates contained a 36-kDa lactose-binding galectin. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analyses on chymotryptic peptides from the 36-kDa lectin confirmed its identity as Gal-3TM1. The TM1 insert contains a single transmembrane-spanning region and a leucine zipper-like stalk domain that is predicted to position the intact carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal-3TM1 on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane.

Carbohydrate on the outer membrane surface of cells has long been suggested as a determinant of specific cell-cell and cell-matrix recognition. In bone, carbohydrate receptors on osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors could play a functional role in mediating cell-matrix interactions. Osteoclasts arise from mononuclear hematopoietic precursors in bone marrow and share the same stem cell origin as granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages. A variety of carbohydrate receptors are known to be expressed by monocyte/macrophages, including selectins (1Osborn L.

To resorb bone, osteoclast precursor cells must leave the vasculature, crawl to the resorption site, fuse with other precursors, and attach to the bone surface delimiting the area of bone to be resorbed and form a sealing zone.

Zool. 1982; 224: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Frozen chicken kidneys were obtained from Pel-Freez Inc. Marrow cells were isolated from segments of chicken, mouse, and rat long bones, and osteoclast-like cells were produced by differentiation during culture of marrow cells according to a conventional protocol (32Collin-Osdoby P. Oursler M.J. Rothe L. Webber D. Anderson F. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Marrow cells were also prepared from segments of human long bones obtained as surgical waste by clinical collaborators at Washington University Medical Center; osteoclast-like cells were produced in vitro as described by Kukita et al. (33Kukita T. McManus L.M. Miller M. Civin C. Roodman G.D. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 532-538PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from purified chicken osteoclasts, marrow-derived osteoclast-like cells, and fresh 4-week-old chick tissues using an Ultraspec II total RNA kit (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). Northern blotting followed a conventional protocol. Fifteen micrograms of RNA/lane was electrophoresed on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.04m MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 0.01 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 6.7% formaldehyde. Gels were then briefly soaked in 20× SSC, blotted onto nylon membranes (Immobilon, Millipore, Inc.) in 20× SSC, and UV-cross-linked. A second identical gel was also run and visualized with EtBr. Blots were pre-hybridized with Northern Lights Prehybridization solution (Ambion, Inc.) at 42 °C for at least 90 min. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) by incubation with Klenow fragment, dNTP mix, and specific primers. Free un-incorporated nucleotides were removed, and labeled probes were then hybridized with Northern blots for 15–18 h at 42 °C. Blots were washed twice with 3× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C and then twice with 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at 60 °C prior to phosphorimaging with a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) or autoradiography. In initial work, total RNA was isolated from chicken giant cells derived from bone marrow cells cultured for 5 days (31Osdoby P. Martini M.C. Caplan A.I. J. Exp. Zool. 1982; 224: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase step was carried for 50 min at 42 °C using an oligo(dT)12–18 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Inc.). After inactivation of the transcriptase, the cDNA was used as a template in PCR with chicken galectin-3 primers 1 and 5 (see “Materials”). In subsequent studies, total RNA was purified from osteoclasts and tissues isolated from chicks according to Collin-Osdoby et al. (26Collin-Osdoby P. Oursler M.J. Webber D. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This procedure, which includes an immunoaffinity purification step with osteoclast-specific 121F antibody, produces >95% pure osteoclast preparations. RNA was then digested with DNase I (15–40 min at 30 °C) and cDNA produced using an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase according to a protocol provided by the supplier (Invitrogen). This reaction mixture and associated control mixture (without reverse transcriptase) were then treated with RNase H for 20 min at 37 °C and used as templates in PCR runs. Two partially overlapping oligonucleotides of 105 and 107 bp representing the majority of the TM1 insert sequence were chemically synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (IDT, Inc.). The oligos were filled in by incubating with 4 units of Klenow fragment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the enzyme was then heat-inactivated at 75 °C, and this double-stranded template was diluted 1/50 and used in a polymerase chain reaction with specific primers (#9 and 4, see “Materials”). A resultant band of 197 bp was isolated and labeled as described above and used for Northern blotting. Hydrophobicity analyses were carried out by applying the TMPred (35Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 347: 166-170Google Scholar) and TopPred2 (36von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) programs to galectin-3TM1 and other protein sequences of interest. Rats were anesthetized, and bilateral tibial marrow ablation was performed as described by Gorski et al. (37Gorski J.P. Apone S. Shaffer K.A. Batchelder A. Jean W. Williams J.A. Shacter E. Eyre D.R. Bone. 2000; 27: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Tibias were removed intact from rats on days 8–10 following ablation surgery and fixed/decalcified for 2 days in Bouin's solution and then for 6–10 days in 4% formaldehyde containing 0.85% sodium chloride and 10% acetic acid (changing the latter solution every 2 days). Longitudinal sections of ablated tibias were immunostained using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat galectin-3 antibody (4 μg/ml IgG) (38Hubert M. Wang S.Y. Wang J.L. Seve A.P. Hubert J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and a Vectastain ABC goat secondary antibody kit with a glucose oxidase detection system and colorimetric substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). In some cases, sections were also either double- or single-stained for TRAP (Sigma Chemical Co.) following instructions from the supplier. Purified chicken osteoclasts were fixed briefly in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in Hanks' balanced salt solution, permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 20 mm HEPES, 300 mmsucrose, 50 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm magnesium chloride, and then blocked 30 min in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered salt solution. Cells were incubated with primary anti-chicken retinal galectin antibodies (1/200), rinsed, incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies, rinsed again, and then stained with 0.3 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc.) prior to viewing. Alternatively, purified chicken osteoclasts were cultured overnight after isolation and then surface-labeled without permeabilization as follows. After rinsing with warm Hanks' balanced salt solution, cells were fixed in the cold for 15 min, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then blocked for 1 h as described above. Cells were sequentially incubated with anti-chicken retinal galectin antibodies (1/200), rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, stained with (1/250) biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) (Invitrogen) in blocking solution, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated in the dark with (1/1000) fluorescence isothiocyanate-labeled streptavidin in blocking solution. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were either visualized directly or after incubation with 4 units/ml phalloidin-Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in phosphate-buffered saline and then rinsing away excess stain. Slides with stained cells were mounted with buffered glycerol mounting media and viewed with a Leica confocal photomicroscope; fluorescein and Texas Red were visualized using excitation and emission wavelength combinations of 494/518 nm and 595/615 nm, respectively. Adult chicken kidneys (Pel-Freez, Inc.) or fresh-frozen intestines from 4-week-old, calcium-deficient chicks were homogenized with buffer A (75 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), containing 10 mm CHAPS, 75 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine HCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, and 150 mm lactose as modified from (39Leffler H. Masiarz F.R. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9222-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)), and the homogenate was denatured in solubilization solution containing inhibitors (40Gorski J.P. Griffin D. Dudley G. Stanford C. Thomas R. Huang C. Lai E. Karr B. Solursh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an excess of reducing agent before electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient gels (Gradipore, Ltd.). Purified chicken osteoclasts were denatured as described above and electrophoresed. Gels were electroblotted onto a PVDF-P membrane (Millipore, Inc.) and blocked. Blots were processed for colorimetric immunodetection by incubation with (1/500) rabbit anti-chicken liver anti-CLL I (C-16) lactose lectin antibody #1 (prepared by immunization with native protein) or #2 (prepared by immunization with denatured protein) (41Castagna L.F. Landa C.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 42Iglesias M.M. Rabinovich G.A. Ambrosio A.L. Castagna L.F. Sotomayor C.E. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and (1/3000) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Bio-Rad, Inc.) (40Gorski J.P. Griffin D. Dudley G. Stanford C. Thomas R. Huang C. Lai E. Karr B. Solursh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A positive control sample of kidney C-16 lectin was routinely included on each gel and blot. Intestines (1 intestine/6 ml), kidneys (20 g/40 ml), or purified chicken osteoclasts (0.6-ml cell pellet/15 ml) were homogenized and extracted at 4 °C with buffer A and then centrifuged at 108,000 ×gmax for 90 min. The supernatant fraction was dialyzed against buffer A lacking lactose and then chromatographed on a small column of lactosyl-Sepharose 4B (1-ml bed volume) (39Leffler H. Masiarz F.R. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9222-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Unbound material was removed from the column with 80 ml of buffer A lacking lactose, and the bound fraction was eluted with buffer A. Selected fractions were boiled with 0.1% (w/v) SDS and then dialyzed individually against 0.05% SDS in water prior to lyophilization to dryness (40Gorski J.P. Griffin D. Dudley G. Stanford C. Thomas R. Huang C. Lai E. Karr B. Solursh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples then solubilized and electrophoresed on gradient gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands were cut out of polyacrylamide gels, pooled, and processed for trypsin or chymotrypsin in-gel digestion (43Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 44Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Peptides were sequentially extracted from gel pieces with water and with 50% acetonitrile-5% formic acid; pooled extracts were concentrated prior to spotting onto plates. MALDI mass spectra of peptide digests were acquired on a Voyager DE PRO reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) as the matrix (43Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 44Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Spectra were baseline-corrected and mass calibration applied using external standard (0.05% accuracy). The most intense ions on the spectrum and those with a signal-to-noise ratio of 45 and a resolution of better than a 1000 were selected for data base screening with the Protein Prospector program (MS-Fit) (Regents of the University of California). Data base searching with MS-Fit was performed using the following parameters: Species was restricted to Gallus gallus, protein molecular mass range was 25–40 kDa, chymotryptic digest (with one to three missed cleavages), and cysteines were modified by acrylamide and oxidation of methionines. Mass tolerance used was ±0.05% based on external calibration. As shown in Fig. 1 A (left panel), RT-PCR studies with RNA from marrow-derived chicken osteoclasts yielded a larger than expected 753-bp product for galectin-3. A diagram indicating the position of primers used in relation to the published chicken galectin-3 sequence (27Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1 B. A band at 543 bp, the predicted product size, was barely detectable (Fig. 1 A, left panel). When the 753-bp cDNA product was subjected to automated DNA sequencing, a nearly complete identity was observed with the published chicken galectin-3 sequence (27Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and extended from position 330 (near the translation start site) to 800 bp (Fig. 2). Only a single silent base substitution (G for A) was noted at position 722. However, an additional 210-bp open reading frame was found to be inserted between positions 770 and 771 of the chicken galectin-3 sequence (Fig. 2). Although the genomic structure of the chicken galectin-3 gene has yet to be determined, this region is the site of the junction between the third and fourth exons in both the human and mouse Lgals3 genes (45Kadrofske M.M. Openo K.P. Wang J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Rosenberg I.M. Iyer R. Cherayil B. Chiodino C. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12393-12400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We designated this 210-bp open reading frame as insert TM1 and carried out additional studies to confirm that Gal-3TM1 was derived from expressed sequence. Subsequently, use of RNA from highly purified chicken osteoclast preparations (26Collin-Osdoby P. Oursler M.J. Webber D. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) consistently yielded RT-PCR products with the partial Gal-3TM1 sequence (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). No products were obtained in the absence of reverse transcriptase, indicating a dependence upon mRNA template, rather than contaminating DNA. Finally, when a 634-bp product produced with a Gal-3TM1-specific primer (Fig. 1 A, middle panel) was sequenced, the expected TM1 sequence was obtained (Fig. 2). As illustrated in Fig. 1 A after ethidium bromide staining (EtBr, right panel), RT-PCR analysis of the 3′-end of the coding region (using primer pairs 6 + 8 and 7 + 8, see “Materials”) of the chicken osteoclast galectin-3TM1 message identified two major products, a predicted 534-bp cDNA and an unexpected 765-bp band, as well as a larger minor form. Controls without added reverse transcriptase were blank. All three products contained the TM1 insert as evidenced by Southern blotting with this probe (Fig. 1 A, Autorad, rightmost panel). The sequence of the 534-bp cDNA overlapped with the terminal 20 bp of the TM1 insert and then displayed nearly complete identity with positions 772–1259 of the chicken galectin-3 sequence (Fig. 2). Only four changes were identified. The first three of these purine substitutions proved silent, whereas the 3′-most terminal substitution resulted in a Gly to Glu change (predicted 6th exon). The 765-bp cDNA sequence was identical with that for Gal-3TM1, except for an extra 241-bp insert (designated TR1), which followed the TM1 by 89 bp, and an A to G silent substitution on the 3′-side of the insertion site (Fig. 2). Comparisons with genomic human and mouse Lgals3 sequences predict that Gal-3TR1 protein should terminate 11 residues after the 4th exon and contain only a partial carbohydrate recognition domain encoded within the 4th, 5th, and 6th exons (47Seetharaman J. Kanigsberg A. Slaaby R. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was carried out to determine if the expression of galectin-3, galectin-3TM1, or galectin-3TR1 changes during differentiation of osteoclast-like cells in marrow cultures. RNA was isolated from marrow cultures on day 1 (representing replication phase) and on day 5 (representing the differentiation phase) when osteoclast-like cells are present. In contrast to an earlier size estimate of chicken chondrocyte galectin-3 of 1.3 kb (27Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Northern blots revealed two larger bands at 2.0 kb (Gal-3-TR1) and 1.5 kb (Gal-3TM1) (Fig. 3, left panel). However, a low level of expression of the 1.3-kb Gal-3 message would be difficult to detect in the presence of an excess of the 1.5-kb species. Expression of the 1.5- and 2.0-kb forms was found to rise dramatically in cultures treated for 5 days with vitamin D3 and UMR-106 osteoblast cell-conditioned media, conditions that foster differentiation of osteoclast-like cells displaying multin"

In this work, the external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria was studied under the outer membrane rupture induced by the mitochondria hypotonic treatment or the inner membrane permeability transition. The saturation of the oxidation rate was observed as a function of mitochondrial protein concentration. This effect was shown to result from cytochrome c binding to the mitochondrial membranes. At a relatively high concentration of mitochondria, the oxidation rate was strongly activated by 4 mm Mg2+ due to cytochrome c desorption from the membranes. A minimal kinetic model was developed to explain the main phenomena of the external NADH oxidation modulated by cytochrome c and Mg2+ in mitochondria with the ruptured outer membrane. The computational behavior of the model closely agreed with the experimental data. We suggest that the redox state of the released cytochrome c, considered by other authors to be important for apoptosis, may strongly depend on its oxidation by the fraction of mitochondria with the ruptured outer membrane and on the cytoplasmic cytochrome c reductase activity.

The OMM damage also induces the external NADH oxidation by mitochondria (5Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lemeshko V.V.

Biofizika. 1982; 27: 837-840PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of the rotenone-insensitive oxidation of external NADH (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) under hypotonic treatment of liver mitochondria was shown to significantly increase with the age of rats. An increase in population of mitochondria with fragile OMM was assumed to be one of the possible mechanisms of programmed aging and cell death (19Lemeshko V.V. Biofizika. 1982; 27: 837-840PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lemeshko, V. V. (2001) in Molecular Mechanisms of Apoptosis (Keystone Symposia Abstract Book) (Green, D. R., and Evan, G. I., eds) p. 107, Keystone Resort, Keystone, COGoogle Scholar). The idea that the OMM rupture might relate to the aging mechanisms was also recently suggested by Skulachev (21Skulachev V.P. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 995-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). According to some data, the rate of external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria may be stimulated by extramitochondrial cytochrome c (22Lofrumento N.E. Marzulli D. Cafagno L., La Piana G. Cipriani T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The concept of “bi-trans-membrane” electron transport was developed to explain this phenomenon (22Lofrumento N.E. Marzulli D. Cafagno L., La Piana G. Cipriani T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Marzulli D., La Piana G. Cafagno L. Fransvea E. Lofrumento N.E. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that extramitochondrial cytochrome c, reduced on the OMM by external NADH, might be directly oxidized by cytochrome c oxidase of mitochondria, transferring electrons through the intact OMM. It was suggested that “intact (but not damaged) mitochondria are able to promote the oxidation of exogenous cytochrome c” (24Marzulli D., La Piana G. Fransvea E. Lofrumento N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data obtained by Bodrova et al. (10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Additionally, Mg2+ ions significantly stimulate the external NADH oxidation (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which may be explained by cytochrome c desorption from the mitochondrial membranes under Mg2+ influence (11Lemeshko V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this work, it was shown that the rate of external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria with the ruptured outer membrane strongly depends on cytochrome c desorption from mitochondrial membranes modulated by Mg2+ ions. A minimal kinetic model was developed to explain these experimental data, and its computational behavior was studied. Sucrose, d-mannitol, Hepes, Trizma base, EGTA, β-NADH, bovine heart cytochrome c, bovine serum albumin (free of fatty acids, fraction V), rotenone, antimycin A, myxothiazol, carbonyl-cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, l-ascorbic acid, MgCl2, and other salts were purchased from Sigma. All chemicals were of analytical grade. White rats of 180–220 g, starved for 12–14 h, were used. Liver mitochondria were isolated by the standard procedure of differential centrifugation using the medium composed of 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4. Mitochondria were washed and finely suspended in the medium composed of 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.02 mmEGTA, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.3 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (free of fatty acids). Protein concentration was determined by the biuret method using Na+-cholate, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. NADH oxidation was measured polarographically, using the Cole-Parmer Oxygen Meter connected with the Linseis L250-E recorder to register oxygen consumption, or fluorimetrically (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The Cole-Parmer oxygen electrode of Clark type was modified to minimize the oxygen diffusion through the membrane from the electrolyte chamber into the mitochondrial suspension. The isotonic medium composed of 210 mm mannitol, 70 mmsucrose, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 0.02 mm EGTA (MSHG medium) or the strongly hypotonic medium composed of 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.02 mm EGTA (HG medium) were used for most experiments. The influence of mitochondria permeability transition on the external NADH oxidation was studied using the following two media: (a) 100 mmmannitol, 150 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm succinate-Tris, 5 mm phosphate-Tris (MS medium) and (b) 50 mm KCl, 150 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes-Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm succinate-Tris, 5 mm phosphate-Tris (KS medium). All measurements were carried out at 37 °C, constantly stirring the mitochondrial suspensions. Concentrations of cytochromes c and aa3 were determined by the method of differential spectrophotometry according to Williams (26Williams J.N., Jr. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 107: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 27Williams J.N., Jr. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Mitochondria, 0.2 ml of the suspension with protein concentration around 60 mg/ml, were solubilized in 2.2 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.4% (w/v) Triton X-100. The sample was divided into two cuvettes. To reduce the cytochromes in one cuvette, 5 mmascorbate, and after a 2-min interval, 0.5 mm KCN and a few crystals of sodium dithionite were added. The cytochromes in the other cuvette were oxidized by 5 mm ferricyanide. Differential oxidation-reduction spectrum was registered using the double beam spectrophotometer Specord UV VIS. Cytochrome c binding to the mitochondrial membranes was studied by determining its distribution between the supernatant and the pellet of mitochondria centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes. Before centrifugation, mitochondria (0.2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 1.8 ml of HG medium supplemented with 1, 2, 4, 6, or 10 μm exogenous cytochrome c. In parallel, the similar experiments were also performed in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 that was added after 5 min of mitochondria incubation, followed by the remaining 5-min incubation in the presence of Mg2+. After centrifugation, the mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in 0.6 ml of 0.4m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1.6% Triton X-100, and then mixed with 1.8 ml of HG medium. The supernatant (1.8 ml) of each sample was mixed with 0.6 ml of 0.4 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1.6% Triton X-100. Cytochrome c concentration in all obtained samples was measured as described above. Computational analysis of the minimal kinetic model was carried out using the MathCAD 8.0 software (MathSoft, Cambridge, MA) for solving the system of mathematical equations. The addition of NADH to uncoupled rat liver mitochondria incubating in isotonic MSHG medium had almost no effect on the rate of oxygen consumption in the presence of rotenone-antimycin A-myxothiazol, the inhibitors of the respiratory chain (Fig. 1, curve a). An increased rate of NADH oxidation was observed when exogenous cytochrome c was added at relatively high concentration. One order higher rate of external NADH oxidation in the presence of added cytochrome c was observed in hypotonic HG medium (Fig. 1, curve b), as a result of the OMM damage (see Refs. 9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Lemeshko V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and references therein). Fig. 1 (curves a and b) show that Mg2+ ions did not stimulate the external NADH oxidation in the presence of a relatively high concentration of exogenous cytochrome c in both isotonic and hypotonic media, as well as in the absence of exogenous cytochrome c in isotonic medium (Fig. 1, curve c). Moreover, some inhibition of the oxidation rate was observed after addition of 4 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1, curve a). In the HG medium, when the OMM was ruptured, Mg2+ ions alone significantly stimulated the rotenone-insensitive oxidation of external NADH, even in the absence of exogenous cytochrome c (Fig. 1, curve d). Stimulation (Fig. 2, curve a), no effect (Fig. 2, curve b), or some inhibition (Fig. 2,curve c) of the external NADH oxidation was observed after addition of 4 mm Mg2+ into the HG medium containing 1 μm exogenous cytochrome c. The effect depended on the mitochondrial protein concentration that was used in the range of 0.075–0.6 mg/ml. Fluorimetric measurement of NADH oxidation was used in these experiments to obtain a higher sensitivity. At mitochondrial protein concentration of 0.6 mg/ml, a significant activation of the external NADH oxidation by Mg2+ ions was observed (Fig. 2, curve d). In this case, a maximal stimulation was observed at 4–6 mmMg2+ (Fig. 2, curve e), while no essential activation was registered at 12 mm KCl (Fig. 2, curve f), which has the same ionic strength as 4 mmMg2+. The maximal stimulation was only observed at 48 mm KCl (Fig. 2, curve f),i.e. at four times higher ionic strength than that of 4 mm MgCl2. Some progressive inhibition of the external NADH oxidation by 4 mm Mg2+ or higher was observed at relatively small concentration of mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2, curve c). This inhibition was accompanied by a visually observed aggregation of mitochondria, and thus it might be a consequence of cytochrome c oxidase masking within the mitochondrial aggregates. The obtained data confirm the concept that the OMM damage is an obligatory factor for switching on the rotenone-insensitive oxidation of external NADH by rat liver mitochondria (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Lemeshko V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the external NADH oxidation was also suggested to be realized through the contact sites between the OMM and the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) in the intact mitochondria (24Marzulli D., La Piana G. Fransvea E. Lofrumento N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was assumed that under some conditions, when the concentration of cytoplasmic cytochrome c is increased, the external NADH oxidation by intact mitochondria might be significantly activated due to a bi-trans-membrane electron transport catalyzed by external cytochrome c (25La Piana G. Fransvea E. Marzulli D. Lofrumento N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and it could play an essential role in mechanisms of apoptosis. However, it cannot be excluded that the stimulation of the external NADH oxidation by exogenous cytochrome c, observed by the authors (24Marzulli D., La Piana G. Fransvea E. Lofrumento N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25La Piana G. Fransvea E. Marzulli D. Lofrumento N.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), relates to only damaged mitochondria that represent nearly 10% of the total population of isolated mitochondria (11Lemeshko V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Wojtczak L. Rev. Roum. Physiol. 1974; 11: 173-185PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wikström M. Casey R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whatever the mechanism of rotenone-insensitive oxidation of cytoplasmic NADH, activation of this process is likely to be important in redox signaling in apoptosis. The rupture of the OMM is known to be caused by mitochondrial permeability transition resulting, for example, from oxidative stress and/or Ca2+ overload of mitochondria. It might lead to activation of the cytoplasmic NADH oxidation by damaged mitochondria. To demonstrate this possibility in vitro, the IMM permeability transition of energized mitochondria was induced by Ca2+ and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 3). Mitochondria were incubated at two different conditions: (a) in the low ionic strength MS medium, in which 4 mm Mg2+ was added where indicated (Fig. 3, curves a and b) and (b) in the relatively high ionic strength KS medium containing 50 mm KCl (Fig. 3, curves c and d). No exogenous cytochrome c was used in these experiments. The data show that mitochondria permeability transition, accompanied by oxidation of endogenous pyridine nucleotides, dramatically stimulated the external NADH oxidation in both media (Fig. 3). The stimulation was prevented by cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of mitochondria permeability transition (Fig. 3, curves b and d). To clarify the mechanism by which Mg2+ ions influence the external pathway of NADH oxidation, the dependence of the oxidation rate on the total concentration of cytochrome c in the HG medium was presented in Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 4). The total concentration included both the endogenous (310 ± 23 pmol/mg of protein,n = 6) and exogenous cytochrome c. The obtained results show that the Michaelis-Menten constant Km diminished from 7.4 μm cytochrome c, in the absence of Mg2+, to 1.36 μm cytochrome c, in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+. The influence of Mg2+ on the apparent value of Km seems to be through weakening the electrostatic interactions of cytochrome c with the mitochondrial membranes, resulting in an increase of free hemoprotein concentration (11Lemeshko V.V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The saturation of the rate of rotenone-insensitive oxidation of external NADH versus the concentration of mitochondrial protein in hypotonic medium without Mg2+ was observed earlier (28Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Aleksenko T.V. Ukr. Biokhim. Zh. 1995; 67 (in Russian): 28-34PubMed Google Scholar). The data, obtained in the presented work, show that the saturation level depends on cytochrome c concentration in the system (Fig. 5A,curves a and c). In the presence of 4 mm Mg2+, the saturated curves at 1 and 4 μm exogenous cytochrome c were transformed into linear functions (Fig. 5A, curves b and d, respectively). To explain these results, the influence of 4 mm Mg2+ on cytochrome c interaction with the mitochondrial membranes was studied (Fig. 6A). As one can see, the saturation of cytochrome c binding was observed when its concentration in the medium was changed from 0 to 10 μm(Fig. 6A, curve a). Only after the saturation was reached, the linear increase in the supernatant cytochrome c concentration versus the amount of added cytochrome c was observed (Fig. 6A, curve b). In the HG medium without Mg2+, the mitochondrial membranes bind about 2.7 nmol of cytochrome c/0.2 mg of mitochondrial protein (Fig. 6A, curves a and b). According to these data, the number of cytochrome c binding centers was estimated as 13.5 nmol/mg of mitochondrial protein. The measured concentration of cytochromes aa3 was 395 ± 34 pmol/mg of mitochondrial protein (n = 6) that yields 68 molecules of the bound cytochrome c per one cytochrome c oxidase complex at the saturation state.Figure 6Cytochrome c distribution between the mitochondrial membranes (curves a and c) and supernatant (curves b and d) as a function of the added cytochrome c concentration in the absence (curves a and b) or presence of 4 mmMgCl2 (curves c and d). The concentration of mitochondrial protein in HG medium was 0.20 mg/ml. Cytochrome c concentration was measured by the method of differential spectrophotometry. A, the experimental data (n = 6).

Thus, the dissociation constant may be expressed as follows, KN=[C]·([N ]o−[NC])[NC]Equation 1 in which [C] and [NC] are concentrations of the free and bound cytochrome c, respectively, and [N]o is the total concentration of cytochrome c binding centers in the system that depends on the concentration of added mitochondria (see Equation 8). To estimate KN according to Equation 1, the cytochrome c concentration in the supernatant (Fig. 6A,curve b) and the concentration of the centers occupied by cytochrome c (Fig. 6A, curve a) were taken as [C] and [NC], respectively, using the experimental data for 1 μm exogenous cytochrome c in mitochondrial suspension. It was obtained that KN = 0.51 μm cytochrome c, which is close to 0.4 μm obtained by other authors for the mitochondrial membranes (see Ref. 29Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 346: 261-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar for review). The main aspects of the Mg2+ influence on the external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria with the damaged OMM and on the cytochrome c interaction with the mitochondrial membranes may be described in the framework of a kinetic model (Fig. 7). According to this simplified model, cytochrome c (C) interacts with N-centers on the mitochondrial membranes or with cytochrome c oxidase (E), forming the NC or EC complexes, respectively. The model also includes two types of Mg2+ interactions with the membranes. One of them is the occupation of N-centers by competing with cytochrome c. Two Mg2+ ions were assumed to interact with one cytochrome c binding center, taking into account that the cytochrome c binding to the liposomes is characterized by 4–5 negative charges of the outside oriented phospholipids per one molecule of the bound cytochrome c at the saturation state (29Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 346: 261-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The interaction of two Mg2+ ions with the N-center may be expressed as two sequential events, with the equal microscopic dissociation constants, KMg=[Mg2+]·[N][NMg2+],Equation 2 KMg=[Mg2+]·[NMg2+][NMg22+]Equation 3 in which [N], [NMg2+], and [NMg 22+] are concentrations of the free N-centers, the N-centers with one bound Mg2+ ion, and the N-centers with two bound Mg2+ ions, respectively. [Mg2+] is the concentration of free Mg2+. Setting KMg = 0.5 mm, a good agreement between the computational behavior of the model and the experimental data relating to the cytochrome c sorption-desorption (Fig. 6) was obtained. The other type of Mg2+ interaction with the mitochondrial membranes relates to the observed mitochondria aggregation, which might explain the inhibition of the external NADH oxidation. The inhibitory action of Mg2+ ions may be formally represented as the masking of both free cytochrome c oxidase (E) and cytochrome c oxidase occupied by cytochrome c(EC), as it would result from the interaction of Mg2+ with E and EC. For simplicity, both microscopic dissociation constants may be set equal (KA), KA=[Mg2+]·[E][EMg2+]Equation 4 KA=[Mg2+]·[EC][ECMg2+]Equation 5 in which [EMg2+] and [ECMg2+] are the concentrations of the inactive complexes EMg2+ and ECMg2+, respectively. [E] and [EC] are the concentrations of free cytochrome c oxidase and its complexes with cytochrome c, respectively. Determining the dependence of the inhibition of rotenone-insensitive oxidation of external NADH on the concentration of Mg2+ in the HG medium containing 25 μmexogenous cytochrome c, it was evaluated that KA = 6.5 mm. The total concentration of Mg2+ in the system, [Mg2+]o, may be described as follows. [Mg2+ ]o=[Mg2+]+[NMg2+]+2·[NMg22+]+[EMg2+]Equation 6 +[ECMg2+]The total concentration of the cytochrome c binding centers, [N]o, is as follows. [N ]o=[N]+[NC]+[NMg2+]+[NMg22+]Equation 7 On the other hand, [N ]o=n·[E ]oEquation 8 in which n = 68, determined above as the number of N-centers per one cytochrome c oxidase complex, and [E]o is the concentration of cytochrome c oxidase in the system that may be calculated by knowing the mitochondrial protein concentration, [Mc], and cytochromes aa3 concentration, [aa3], in mitochondria. [E ]o=[Mc]·[aa3]2Equation 9 On the other hand, the total concentration of cytochrome c oxidase is as follows. [E ]o=[E]+[EC]+[EMg2+]+[ECMg2+]Equation 10 Assuming that the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity of the OMM is not the limiting factor for the external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria (1Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), and a simple first-order reaction Michaelis-Menten approximation for cytochrome c oxidase, as it would be at high ionic strength conditions (30Cooper Ch. E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the rate of the external NADH oxidation may be described as, v=k·([E]+[EC])·[C]Km+[C]Equation 11 in which Km is simply the dissociation constant, Km=[C]·[E][EC]Equation 12 that is Km =k−1/k+1. It was estimated that Km = 1.36 μm (Fig. 4,curve b), assuming for simplicity a complete desorption of cytochrome c from the N-centers in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 6A, curves d and c), like that observed at high ionic strength conditions (8Matlib M.A. O'Brien P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have to set Km = 1.36 μm at any Mg2+ concentration, regardless of a very different apparent value determined in the absence of Mg2+, specifically 7.4 μm (Fig. 4,curve a). This discrepancy is explained by sorption of cytochrome c on the mitochondrial membranes in the low ionic strength medium without Mg2+ that leads to a significant diminishing of the free concentration of cytochrome c. Only free cytochrome c seems to be available for the intermembrane electron transport to oxidize the external NADH. To estimate the rate constant k for Equation 11, the value for Vmax was estimated in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4, curve a), and the concentration of cytochrome c oxidase was determined (198 ± 17 pmol/mg of protein) for used mitochondria. It was estimated that k = 2300 min−1. The total concentration of cytochrome c, [C]o, may be described as follows, [C ]o+1.56·[E ]o=[C]+[NC]+[EC]+[ECMg2+]Equation 13 in which [C]o and 1.56[E]o are the concentrations of the exogenous and endogenous cytochrome c, respectively. The coefficient 1.56 is the relation of endogenous cytochrome c (310 ± 24 pmol/mg of protein) to cytochrome c oxidase (198 ± 17 pmol/mg of protein) concentration. The computational behavior of the model (Figs. 5B and6B), described by the system of the mathematical EquationsEquation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9, Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13, was similar to the experimental data related to the external NADH oxidation versus the mitochondrial protein concentration in the HG medium (Fig. 5A) and to the cytochrome c binding to the mitochondrial membranes versus concentration of added cytochrome c (Fig. 6A). This model allows including more details, but even in the simplified form it adequately describes the main aspects of the Mg2+ and cytochrome c influence on the external NADH oxidation by rat liver mitochondria with the ruptured OMM. The external pathway of NADH oxidation is normally not active in intact liver mitochondria (8Matlib M.A. O'Brien P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the conditions for switching it on have not been established, except the OMM rupture or its permeabilization for cytochrome c (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Physiological electron acceptors for the OMM electron transport system in the cell are also unknown. It is not excluded that some small redox molecules may serve as electron transporters between the OMM and the IMM executing direct oxidation of cytoplasmic NADH by mitochondria. External cytochrome c, which may be reduced by the intact liver mitochondria, is normally not present in the cytoplasm. Even in the presence of external cytochrome c, the OMM integrity is a limiting factor for external NADH oxidation (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10Bodrova M.E. Dedukhova V.I. Mokhova E.N. Skulachev V.P.

Mitochondria with the ruptured OMM are able to oxidize the external NADH, and Mg2+ ions were shown to significantly stimulate this oxidation (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech.

Biophys. 2001; 388: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, Mg2+ ions do not activate the external NADH oxidation by mitochondria at a relatively high concentration of exogenous cytochrome c in the medium (Fig. 1, curves a and b). A significant activation by Mg2+ions was only observed when exogenous cytochrome c was not added or was present at a relatively small concentration, and the OMM was ruptured by hypotonic treatment (Fig. 1, curve d, and Fig. 2, curves e and f) or by mitochondria permeability transition (Fig. 3, curve a). The stimulatory effect of Mg2+ ions on the external NADH oxidation was phenomenologically revealed in diminishing of the Michaelis-Menten constant Km for cytochrome c (Fig. 4). That may be mainly explained by cytochrome c desorption from the mitochondrial membranes in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the liberated cytochrome c becomes available for the intermembrane electron shuttling between the OMM and IMM (5Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under the external NADH oxidation by mitochondria with the ruptured OMM (Fig. 5A). The analysis of cytochrome c binding to the mitochondrial membranes, as a function of the cytochrome c concentration in the HG medium, allowed estimation of the number of cytochrome c binding centers on the mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 6A,curves a and b), as well as the dissociation constant (using Equation 1 and the data in Fig. 6A,curves a and b, for 1 μm cytochrome c). These data were required to develop a minimal kinetic model (Fig. 7) for explaining the main aspects of the Mg2+and cytochrome c influence on the external NADH oxidation. A very good agreement between the computational behavior of this model and the experimental data was obtained for both the external NADH oxidation (Fig. 5) and the cytochrome c binding to the mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 6). Electrostatic interaction is the main factor for cytochrome c sorption on the mitochondrial membranes, because almost all (8Matlib M.A. O'Brien P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or at least 90% of cytochrome c (31Cortese J.D. Voglino A.L. Hackenbrock C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6402-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were desorbed at physiological ionic strength. The influence of Mg2+ on cytochrome c interaction with the mitochondrial membranes was more specific than it would be expected taking into account only the ionic strength value (Fig. 2). Therefore, a discrete character of the charge distribution on the mitochondrial membranes and on the cytochrome c seems to be a prevalent factor. The number of cytochrome c binding centers of the hypotonically treated mitochondria was estimated as 68 per one cytochrome c oxidase. These centers seem to be mainly formed by negatively charged phospholipids. Mitochondria contain about 150 μg pf phospholipid/mg of protein, where 19% is cardiolipin (32Taylor D.D. The Mitochondria in the Health and Disease. VCH Publishers Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). That yields about 21 nmol of cardiolipin/mg of protein or 106 molecules per one cytochrome c oxidase complex. At least one molecule of cardiolipin may be included in one cytochrome c binding center on the mitochondrial membranes, because some fraction of this phospholipid faces the matrix side of the IMM. The other two of the assumed four negative charges, which form one cytochrome c binding N-center according to our model, might belong to one-charge phospholipids, as phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, etc. (29Nicholls P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 346: 261-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial permeability transition and the OMM rupture, or its permeabilization, have been recognized as crucial steps in molecular mechanisms of apoptosis (15Petit P.X. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Gerontol. 2001; 36: 995-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Earlier we showed that the hypotonic fragility of the OMM of rat liver mitochondria was significantly changed with age and that it was different for male and female aged rats (9Lemeshko V.V. Shekh V.E. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 68: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 18Martinou J.-C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E41-E43Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the OMM rupture of a critical fraction of mitochondria may lead to cell death, while the age-dependent increase in the population of mitochondria with the fragile OMM might be one of the possible mechanisms of programmed aging (18Martinou J.-C. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E41-E43Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 20Lemeshko, V. V. (2001) in Molecular Mechanisms of Apoptosis (Keystone Symposia Abstract Book) (Green, D. R., and Evan, G. I., eds) p. 107, Keystone Resort, Keystone, COGoogle Scholar). Strong stimulation of the external (cytoplasmic) NADH oxidation, caused by the OMM rupture, may change the redox potentials of cytoplasmic pyridine nucleotides, glutathione, and cytochrome c, influencing oxidative stress-linked (7Skulachev V.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and redox-signaling mechanisms of apoptosis (17Cai J. Yang J. Jones D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 33Pan Z. Voehringer D.W. Meyn R.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Hancock J.T.

Med. 2000; 29: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was recently proposed that the redox state of cytoplasmic cytochrome c, modulated by reduced glutathione, might be a key regulator of programmed cell death (34Hancock J.T. Desikan R. Neill S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 697-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this respect, the NADH-dependent electron transport systems of the OMM and endoplasmic reticulum seem to be even more powerful modulators of the redox state of cytoplasmic cytochrome c. It has been directly shown for two mouse lymphoma cell lines in a cell-free system that apoptotic activity depends on the redox state of cytochrome c, i.e. the reduced cytochrome c was not pro-apoptotic (33Pan Z. Voehringer D.W. Meyn R.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration of cytochrome c liberated from mitochondria with the ruptured OMM is sufficiently high for a significant stimulation of the cytoplasmic NADH oxidation, taking into account the data in Fig. 3. Since the NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity of the OMM is significantly higher than cytochrome c oxidase activity of the IMM (1Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernster L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), the released cytochrome c is expected to be maintained in the reduced steady state (5Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus preventing pro-apoptotic activity of this hemoprotein until cytoplasmic NADH is exhausted. Besides, the NAD(P)H-cytochrome c reductase activity of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes might also reduce cytoplasmic cytochrome c. The role of these and other cytoplasmic redox events in the mechanisms of apoptosis and necrosis have to be elucidated in the future."

A role for glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids in phospholipase C-mediated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation has been previously documented. These earlier studies utilized a first generation glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor to deplete cells of their glycosphingolipids. Recently, more active and specific glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors, includingd-threo-ethylendioxyphenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidinopropanol (d-t-EtDO-P4), have been designed.d-t-EtDO-P4 has the advantage of blocking glucosylceramide synthase at low nanomolar concentrations but does not cause secondary elevations in cell ceramide levels. In the present study, d-t-EtDO-P4 depleted cellular glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide in cultured ECV304 cells at nanomolar concentrations without obvious cellular toxicity. The expression of several signaling proteins was evaluated in glycosphingolipid-depleted ECV304 cells to study the role of glycosphingolipids in phospholipase C-mediated signaling. No difference was observed in the cellular expression of phospholipase C-γ between controls and glycolipid-depleted cells. Western blot analysis, however, revealed that depletion of endogenous glycosphingolipids in cultured ECV304 cells with d-t-EtDO-P4 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum induction at 100 nm. The phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ induced by d-t-EtDO-P4 was abolished by exogenously added glucosylceramide, consistent with a specific glycosphingolipid-phospholipase C-γ interaction. The phospholipase C-γ phosphorylation was maximally enhanced by bradykinin when cells were exposed to 100 nmd-t-EtDO-P4. The measurement of cellular activity of phospholipase C-γ, by myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate radioreceptor assay, demonstrated that depletion of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids in cultured ECV304 cells withd-t-EtDO-P4 resulted in significantly increased formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate above base line, and an increased sensitivity of phospholipase C-γ to bradykinin stimulation. Thus, the activation of phospholipase C-γ is negatively regulated by membrane glycosphingolipids in ECV304 cells.

Thus, the activation of phospholipase C-γ is negatively regulated by membrane glycosphingolipids in ECV304 cells. Caveolae are small invaginations in plasma membranes, recognized almost 50 years ago (1Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 455-457Google Scholar). These invaginations depend on the expression of caveolin-1, an integral membrane protein. Caveolae are also characterized biochemically as low density membrane domains that are highly enriched in both cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Cells that lack caveolin-1 also have low density domains, commonly termed lipid rafts or glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains.Several investigators have provided support for the hypothesis that these microdomains are hot spots for cell signaling. Support for this view includes the observation that several signaling molecules are concentrated in these lipid domains.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) are concentrated in caveolae. Both lipids are subject to hydrolysis following stimulation of cells with agonists. In addition, other receptors such as angiotensin II (15Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and bradykinin (16de Weerd W.F. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) are recruited to caveolae following the stimulation of cells with agonists.Cholesterol appears to be important for the regulation of signal transduction within these microdomains. For example, the depletion of cellular cholesterol with either filipin or lovastatin inhibits PDGF-stimulated kinase activities. Similarly, the depletion of cholesterol with methyl β-cyclodextrin inhibits EGF- and angiotensin II-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (17Ushio-Fukai M. Hilenski L. Santanam N. Becker P.L., Ma, Y. Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48269-48275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). By contrast, less is known about the potential role of glycosphingolipids in the regulation of signaling events. In earlier work it had been reported that glucosylceramide depletion of MDCK cells with a first generation glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, PDMP, resulted in the enhanced formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate following bradykinin stimulation (18Shayman J.A. Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G. Barcelon F. Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12135-12138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation had several limitations. First, the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, PDMP, had limited activity and specificity. Glucosylceramide depletion was also accompanied by an increase in cell ceramide levels (19Rani C.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Second, the mechanism of enhanced phospholipase C activity was not delineated. Third, little was known regarding the microdomains in which phospholipase C activity was present to interpret the significance of this observation.A new generation of glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors has recently been described (20Shayman J.A. Lee L. Abe A. Shu L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These inhibitors, typified by EtDO-P4, are active at low nanomolar concentrations. These glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors also do not raise ceramide levels at concentration at which near complete depletion of glucosylceramide and other glucosylceramide-based glycolipids occurs. EtDO-P4 and isotype-specific antibodies to phospholipase C-γ provide the basis for new studies on the mechanism of glycolipid-regulated inositol trisphosphate formation.RESULTSd-t-EtDO-P4 was first solubilized in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted in culture medium prior to addition to achieve a final Me2SO concentration of less than 0.03%. ECV304 cells grown in the medium containing up to 0.1% Me2SO alone for 48 h did not show any significant changes in cell morphology, cell viability, protein, and total phospholipid content compared with control cells (data not shown). The cytotoxicity induced by d-t-EtDO-P4 on the ECV304 cells was measured by trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase release. The concentration at which toxicity was observed in 50% of the cultured cells (TC50 value) was 6 ± 0.25 μm (n = 9) after a 48-h incubation with d-t-EtDO-P4.The concentration-dependent depletion of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide in ECV304 cells byd-t-EtDO-P4 was next determined (Fig. 1, A and B). Cells were incubated with d-t-EtDO-P4 for 48 h at varying concentrations of inhibitor (0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 nm) in serum-free medium. Under these conditions, treatment of cells with 100 nmd-t-EtDO-P4 resulted in maximal decrements of 99.9% glucosylceramide mass and 99.7% lactosylceramide mass, respectively. The concentrations at which half-maximal depletion of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide occurred were 0.2 ± 0.05 nm and 0.4 ± 0.05 nm, respectively. The ratio of TC50/IC50 or selective index was >12,000. The toxicities associated with PDMP and earlier homologues of the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor were associated with elevations in cell ceramide content.To confirm the high selective index observed withd-t-EtDO-P4 treatment of the ECV304 cells occurred in the absence of changes in cell ceramide levels, ceramide content was determined using the diglyceride kinase assay. At concentrations where d-t-EtDO-P4 was highly effective in depleting glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide, cell ceramide levels were not significantly elevated in ECV304 cells (Fig. 2). Only a 10% increase in ceramide content was seen when ECV304 cells were incubated with 600 nmd-t-EtDO-P4 for 48 h. No changes in sphingomyelin content were detected in cells treated withd-t-EtDO-P4 (data not shown). These results confirm that d-t-EtDO-P4 is both an active and specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase.Figure 2Quantitative measurements of ceramide levels in the absence and presence ofd-t-EtDO-P4. Whole cellular lipid extracts were normalized by lipid phosphate assay. The ceramide in the lipid extract (50 nmol of total lipid phosphate (l.p.)) was converted to [32P]ceramide 1-phosphate by enzymatic reaction with diacylglycerol kinase as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The levels of [32P]ceramide were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry and quantified according to a standard curve (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The lipid composition of the intact ECV304 cells and the glycosphingolipid-enriched fractions were compared (Table I). As previously observed in NIH 3T3 cells, a significant enrichment of the major cellular sphingolipids was observed (25Shu L. Lee L. Chang Y. Holzman L.B. Edwards C.A. Shelden E. Shayman J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A moderate enrichment of cholesterol was also seen. Triglyceride, on the other hand, was markedly de-enriched in the sphingolipid-enriched fractions. The effect of glucosylceramide synthase inhibition on the glycosphingolipids from these fractions was evaluated by radiolabeling the ECV304 cells withd-[1-3H]galactose (Fig. 3). The major glycolipids labeled in the intact cells were glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, globotriaosylceramide, and ganglioside GM3. Globotriaosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 were not detected by charring of the thin layer chromatography plates. Their identification by radiolabeling was aided by the incorporation of the tritiated galactose into both glucose and galactose by the conversion of the radiolabeled substrate, UDP-glucose, to UDP-galactose by a cellular epimerase (18Shayman J.A. Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G. Barcelon F. Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12135-12138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeling of glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and globotriaosylceramide was increased in the sphingolipid-enriched fractions. However, ganglioside GM3 was significantly de-enriched in these fractions. The absence of ganglioside GM3 in these fractions is consistent with previous observations (26Iwabuchi K. Handa K.

Because phospholipase C-γ has been identified as a key mediator of PDGF-dependent cellular transformation (27DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the expression of PDGF-Rβ, therefore, was also examined. ECV304 cells were exposed for 48 h to concentrations of d-t-EtDO-P4 ranging from 50 to 300 nm. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. No significant differences were observed in the cellular expression of phospholipase C-γ1, phospholipase C-β1, phospholipase C-δ1, annexin II, eNOS III, c-Raf-1, PDGF-Rβ, and Ras between control cells and cells treated with EtDO-P4. These results demonstrate that depletion of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids with EtDO-P4 has no effect on the expression of these proteins in cultured ECV304 cells.Figure 4Effects ofd-t-EtDO-P4 on expressions of signaling enzymes in cultured human ECV304 cells.

The tyrosine phosphorylation was concentration-dependent and paralleled the depletion of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide. Concentrations of d-t-EtDO-P4 in excess of 100 nm, however, caused a reduction of phospholipase C-γ1 phosphorylation to basal levels. When ECV304 cells were simultaneously incubated withd-t-EtDO-P4 and exogenously added glucosylceramide (1 μm), the effect ofd-t-EtDO-P4 on the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ was abrogated (Fig. 5B), consistent with a functional role of glycosphingolipids in the mediation of transient tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1.Figure 5Effect ofd-t-EtDO-P4 on tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 in human ECV304 cells. The human ECV304 cells were incubated either withd-t-EtDO-P4 alone or simultaneously withd-t-EtDO-P4 and 1 μm glucosylceramide or lactosylceramide in liposomes for 48 h. Cell lysates (600 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 4–13% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with anti-phospholipase C-γ1 antibody. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments.

The concentration- and time-dependent effects of EtDO-4 on bradykinin-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation were studied (Fig. 6, A–C). The peak formation of 1,4,5-IP3 formation was observed in cells exposed to 100 nm EtDO-P4. At this concentration of inhibitor, glucosylceramide content was maximally depleted and peak phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 were noted. Cells were also stimulated with 2 μm bradykinin. A markedly increased 1,4,5-IP3 accumulation above base line was observed in bradykinin-stimulated cells treated with inhibitor. The peak effect was noted to occur at 100 nm EtDO-P4 (Fig. 6A).Figure 6Effect ofd-t-EtDO-P4 on phospholipase C-γ1 enzyme activity in human ECV304 cells.A, cells either untreated or treated withd-t-EtDO-P4 were stimulated with or without 2 μm bradykinin (BK) for 2 min. B and C, cells were incubated withd-t-EtDO-P4 at various concentrations. At the end of treatments, cells were stimulated by 2 μmbradykinin for the indicated time intervals. Bradykinin stimulation was stopped with 100% trichloroacetic acid, and 1,4,5-IP3 was extracted. The level of 1,4,5-IP3 was determined by a competitive ligand-binding assay and quantified by a standard curve. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The relationship between inhibitor concentration and peak 1,4,5-IP3 formation was determined. The stimulation with bradykinin resulted in a more sustained generation of 1,4,5-IP3 as the concentration ofd-t-EtDO-P4 increased (Fig. 6, B and C). When control cells were stimulated by 2 μmbradykinin in the absence of inhibitor pretreatment, a peak of 1,4,5-IP3 formation was observed at 30 s. In cells treated with 50 nm EtDO-P4 for 48 h the peak formation of 1,4,5-IP3 shifted to 1 min (Fig. 6B). Exposure of cells to 100 and 200 nmd-t-EtDO-P4 for 48 h resulted in a delay in the maximal formation of 1,4,5-IP3 to 2 and 3 min, respectively (Fig. 6C).The phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 was further assessed to determine whether the change in peak 1,4,5-IP3 formation corresponded to a change in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the lipase. A peak in tyrosine phosphorylation of the phospholipase was noted to occur at 100 nm EtDO-P4 in the bradykinin stimulated cells (Fig. 7A), the same concentration noted in the unstimulated cells (Fig. 5). No change in total phospholipase C-γ1 was observed. When the phosphorylation was evaluated as a function of time following bradykinin exposure, cells that were not treated with inhibitor demonstrated a peak tyrosine phosphorylation at 30 s (Fig. 7B). In contrast, cells pretreated with 100 nm EtDO-P4 demonstrated a peak of tyrosine phosphorylation at 2 min. The time course was comparable with that observed for 1,4,5-IP3 formation (Fig. 7C).Figure 7Enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1 by bradykinin (BK) stimulation in glycosphingolipid-depleted human ECV304 cells.A, controls and treated cells (100 nmd-t-EtDO-P4) were stimulated with 2 μm bradykinin for 2 min. Following stimulation, cells were lysed, and the cell lysates (600 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunoprecipitates (upper panel) and 10 μg of cell lysate protein (lower panel) were subjected to a 4–13% gradient SDS-PAGE. After transfer the membrane was probed with a monoclonal antibody to phospholipase C-γ1. B, control cells were stimulated with 2 μm bradykinin for different time intervals. C, treated cells were exposed to 100 nmd-t-EtDO-P4 for 48 h, and were then stimulated with 2 μm bradykinin for various times.

In earlier studies the treatment of MDCK cells with PDMP, a first generation glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, increased hormone-stimulated 1,4,5-IP3 levels significantly over base line (18Shayman J.A. Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G. Barcelon F. Inokuchi J. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12135-12138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect increased as a function of PDMP exposure and could be replicated in isolated plasma membranes. Furthermore, the increased 1,4,5-IP3 occurred in membranes exposed to GTPγS, consistent with an increased activity of phospholipase C. No changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were observed. As in the present study, the PDMP effect was reversed with exogenous glucosylceramide but not galactosylceramide addition. In a subsequent study, increases in endogenous glucosylceramide were shown to have the opposite effect (28Mahdiyoun S. Deshmukh G.D. Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The incubation of MDCK cells with conduritol B epoxide, an inhibitor of β-glucocerebrosidase, inhibited phospholipase-dependent 1,4,5-IP3 formation. The conduritol B epoxide effect was both time- and concentration-dependent.PDMP represents the prototypical glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor. This compound has found widespread application as a tool for the cellular depletion of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids (20Shayman J.A. Lee L. Abe A. Shu L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 373-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PDMP contains two chiral carbons and thus four enantiomers. Only thed-threo enantiomer of this compound is active conferring a relative high degree of specificity. However, its use is limited in two respects. First, the inhibitory activity of PDMP against the cerebroside synthase is in the middle micromolar range. Second, PDMP treatment of cells results in the accumulation of ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid. The ceramide elevating effect was originally believed to be secondary to the accumulation of substrate for glucosylceramide formation. However, with the development of more active PDMP homologues, specifically 1-phenyl-2-palmitoyl-3-pyrrolidinopropanol, the ceramide elevation was shown to result from the inhibition of a second enzyme, 1-O-acylceramide synthase (29Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This enzyme has phospholipase A2 activity and catalyzes the transacylation of sn-2 fatty acids from phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine to the 1-hydroxyl of ceramide. Both PDMP and P4 inhibit the transacylase at micromolar concentrations.The recognition of this second site of PDMP activity and the ability to dissociate ceramide accumulation from glucosylceramide depletion led to the design and synthesis of more active PDMP homologues by Hansch analysis (21Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2047703905,"Tryptophan 1093 resides in the 28-residue calmodulin-binding/autoinhibitory domain of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA). Previous studies with the isolated calmodulin-binding/autoinhibitory peptide from PMCA have shown that mutations of the tryptophan residue decrease the affinity of the peptide for calmodulin and its affinity as an inhibitor of proteolytically activated pump. In this study, the PMCA mutation in which tryptophan 1093 is converted to alanine (W1093A) was constructed in the full-length PMCA isoform 4b. The mutant pump was expressed in COS cells, and its steady state and pre-steady state kinetic properties were examined. The W1093A pump exhibited an increased basal activity in the absence of calmodulin, so the activation was ∼2-fold (it is 10-fold in the wild type). The W1093A mutation also lowered the steady state affinity for calmodulin from K0.5 of 9 nm for wild type to 144 nm (assayed at 700 nm free Ca2+). Pre-steady state measurements of the rate of activation by Ca2+-calmodulin revealed that the W1093A mutant responded 2.5-fold faster to calmodulin. In contrast to these relatively modest effects, the half-time of inactivation of the mutant was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude from 41 min to 7 s. We conclude that tryptophan 1093 does not play a substantial role in Ca2+-calmodulin recognition; rather it functions primarily to slow the inactivation of the calmodulin-activated pump.

The plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase or pump (ATP2B1–4, referred to here as PMCA) 1The abbreviations used are: PMCAplasma membrane Ca2+ pumpTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidMESG2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleosidedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylh4bhuman 4b 1The abbreviations used are: PMCAplasma membrane Ca2+ pumpTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidMESG2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleosidedansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylh4bhuman 4b and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger are the main mechanisms for removing Ca2+ from the cell. Ca2+ removal is required to maintain a steady Ca2+ disequilibrium of ∼105 between the cytoplasm and the extracellular milieu and to create the Ca2+ spikes, waves, and oscillations that are the most ubiquitous signaling systems in the cell. Regulation of PMCA occurs via allosteric activation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Before activation, PMCA is inhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the inhibitory domain at the C terminus and the catalytic core of the molecule. The inhibitory domain contains the calmodulin-binding region of the molecule. A rise in intracellular Ca2+results in 4 Ca2+ binding to calmodulin; the Ca2+-calmodulin complex then binds to the inhibitory domain, activating the pump. Activation results in an increase in the affinity of the pump for Ca2+ at its transport site as well as an increase in its maximal turnover. plasma membrane Ca2+ pump 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl human 4b plasma membrane Ca2+ pump 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl human 4b PMCA in mammals is encoded by four genes with additional diversity provided by alternate splicing at two or more sites (for a recent review of PMCA genes, splicing variants, and nomenclature, see Strehler and Zacharias (1Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar)). PMCA isoforms differ among themselves in three ways: 1) basal activities in the absence of calmodulin, 2) rates of activation by Ca2+-calmodulin, and 3) rates of inactivation by calmodulin dissociation. These differences are caused by differences in the interactions between the inhibitory domain, calmodulin, and the catalytic core. The present study investigates the effect of changing one residue in the inhibitory domain upon these three properties. These differences in PMCA responses are integrated into cellular physiology. A cell that utilizes PMCA to respond rapidly to a Ca2+ spike requires an isoform that has a high basal activity, such as isoform 3f in heart muscle (2Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Elwess N. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4323-4328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and/or one that is activated rapidly by calmodulin, such as isoform 2a in inner ear hair cells. In contrast, a cell that requires a sustained Ca2+signal may utilize isoforms with low basal activity and slow activation by Ca2+-calmodulin, such as isoform 4b in Jurkat T lymphocytes (3Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Penheiter A.R. Pászty K. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. Cell Calcium. 2001; 30: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition to their response to a single Ca2+ spike, PMCA isoforms also have a potentially wide range of responses to a sequence of spikes. An isoform such as 4b, with low basal activity, relatively slow calmodulin activation, but much slower inactivation will allow the first spike to develop for several seconds before becoming activated but may remain activated for several minutes after the spike is dissipated, thus responding much faster to the next Ca2+ spike. We have termed this the “memory effect” of the pump (4Caride A.J. Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Bajzer Z. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39797-39804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and it is thought to be a major driving force for the large number of PMCA isoforms since it is a response that cannot be regulated simply by differences in activity or expression levels. Since much of the information about the role of the inhibitory region of PMCA has been obtained through the use of synthetic peptides (5Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12313-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Vorherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi Á. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a discussion of the data is necessary as background for the present study. The synthetic peptides have been referred to by names such as C28 with C representing the calmodulin-binding domain and the numerals indicating the length of the peptide beginning with leucine 1086 (Fig. 1). C28 is the full-length peptide containing all of the residues necessary for high affinity calmodulin binding (7Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide C28 inhibited the calmodulin-activated form of the pump by competing with the enzyme for calmodulin. The calculated dissociation constant for calmodulin was 0.1 nm (5Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12313-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was comparable to the constant obtained by direct binding experiments with dansyl-calmodulin. In other sets of experiments the C28 peptide was added to a proteolytic fragment or to an expressed construct (ct120), each of which had the C-terminal residues of PMCA removed. Both the proteolytic fragment and ct120 were fully active in the absence of calmodulin since each lacked the autoinhibitory domain. When C28 was added to a truncated PMCA, it caused a decrease in the activity of the enzyme, and the inhibited state was restored. These data showed that the calmodulin-binding domain itself is an inhibitor. The effect of changes in tryptophan 1093 in such peptides has been examined by a series of investigations using peptide C28 in which the tryptophan was replaced. In direct binding experiments with dansyl-calmodulin, changing tryptophan 1093 to alanine increased the Kd for calmodulin from <1 to 18 nm (6Vorherr T. James P. Krebs J. Enyedi Á. McCormick D.J. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In comparable experiments using C28 as a calmodulin antagonist, the mutation increased the Kd from 0.1 to 5 nm. The tryptophan to alanine mutation also had a strong effect on the ability of the peptide to inhibit proteolyzed pump, increasing the IC50 to >30 μm compared with 3 μm for the wild-type C28 peptide (5Enyedi Á. Vorherr T. James P. McCormick D.J. Filoteo A.G. Carafoli E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12313-12321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering experiments with calmodulin and the C20 peptide revealed that only the C-terminal domain of calmodulin bound, and calmodulin remained in an extended, noncollapsed conformation (8Kataoka M. Head J.F. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This extended structure was also confirmed by an NMR solution structure of the C20-Ca2+-calmodulin complex (9Elshorst B. Hennig M. Forsterling H. Diener A. Maurer M. Schulte P. Schwalbe H. Griesinger C. Krebs J. Schmid H. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12320-12332Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, a longer peptide that contained both presumed anchor residues (C24 peptide, Fig. 1) bound both lobes of calmodulin, and calmodulin assumed a collapsed, globular formation (8Kataoka M. Head J.F. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6247-6251Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) typical of calmodulin complexes with peptides from other well studied enzymes such as myosin light chain kinase (10Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 11Ikura M. Barbato G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Cell Calcium. 1992; 13: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and calmodulin kinase II (12Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of C20 bound to calmodulin revealed that the residue with the most contacts to calmodulin was tryptophan 1093 (tryptophan 8 in C20), the presumed anchor residue. The tryptophan R-group was buried in calmodulin, making contacts with nine different residues of the C-terminal domain. The old peptide results, while very interesting, were from experiments necessarily performed on molecules differing substantially from the full-length PMCA. In full-length PMCA, the calmodulin-binding domain is flanked by upstream and downstream sequences and interacts with the catalytic core of the pump. To relate these results to the active pump, we constructed the full-length W1093A mutation and examined its kinetic properties. This is the first report of any full-length PMCA mutation affecting calmodulin activation. The aims of this research were to determine the kinetic role of the C-terminal domain anchor on 1) basal activity (degree of autoinhibition), 2) rate of activation by calmodulin, and 3) rate of inactivation by calmodulin dissociation. Our results show that the main role of Trp-1093 is to slow the inactivation of the pump when calmodulin is removed from the solution. Since a slower inactivation contributes to a longer molecular memory of previous stimulations (4Caride A.J. Penheiter A.R. Filoteo A.G. Bajzer Z. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39797-39804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), our result gives an underpinning to an important physiological property. Overlapping PCR was used to create a cassette with a silent SacII site at the nucleotide positions partially encoding phenylalanine 1094 to glycine 1096 in the center of the 28-residue calmodulin binding motif of hPMCA4b. The front PCR product was amplified with the primer pair 5′-TGACAACATCAACACAGCCC-3′/5′-CCGCGGAAC GC AGGATCTGGCCTCGGCG-3′. The back PCR product was amplified with the primer pair 5′-CCGCGGCCTGAACCGTATCCAGAC-3′/5′-CTCGAGGGTACCTCAAACTGATGTCTCTAGG-3′. The silent SacII sites are underlined, and the residues to change the tryptophan codon to alanine are shown with double underlines. The template for the PCRs was full-length h4b in pMM2 (pMM2 was originally called pMT2-m (13Adamo H.P. Verma A.K. Sanders M.A. Heim R. Salisbury J.L. Wieben E.D. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). The front PCR product contained a unique endogenous XbaI site near the 5′-end, while a unique KpnI site was added to the 3′-end of the back PCR product immediately after the stop codon. Two PCR products were separately cloned into the pCR Blunt II TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and ligated at the SacII site. The W1093A-encoding insert was excised from pCR Blunt II TOPO with XbaI and KpnI. The excised insert was then ligated to XbaI/KpnI-cut vector of full-length h4b in pMM2 to replace the wild-type insert. A single PCR was carried out with 5′-TGACAACATCAACACAGCCC-3′/5′-GGTACCCTAGGAACTATGGAACGCTTT-3′. The reverse primer contains a stop codon (underlined) to truncate the protein immediately after serine 1113 and a KpnI site for cloning. The PCR product was first cloned into pCR Blunt II TOPO, then excised with XbaI and KpnI, and ligated to the vector fragment of an XbaI/KpnI-digested full-length h4b in pMM2. This produced a construct ending immediately after the 28-residue calmodulin binding motif. This construct was named ct92 W1093A (C-terminal mutant truncated of92 residues). COS cells were transfected with the constructs using LipofectAMINE as described previously (14Elwess N.L. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17981-17986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Crude microsomal membranes from COS cells were prepared as described previously (15Verma A.K.

Ca2+transport was measured by the incorporation of45Ca2+ into inside-out vesicles prepared from COS cells that transiently expressed PMCA. The conditions of the assay were 25 mm TES triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 7 mmMgCl2, 40 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 7.2, 5 mm NaN3, 160 mm KCl, 5 ng/ml oligomycin, 400 nm thapsigargin, ±544 nmcalmodulin, 100 μm total CaCl2, and EGTA was varied to obtain the desired free Ca2+ concentration. The reaction was initiated with 6 mm ATP and allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C. The vesicles were then filtered, washed, and counted to measure 45Ca2+ incorporation. This was measured as described above for Ca2+ transport plus or minus 2 μm calmodulin. This was measured at 0.7 μm free Ca2+ in the same assay conditions as described above. The data were plotted as fractional activation (f) = (v −V0)/(Vmax −V0), where V0 is the activity in the absence of calmodulin, Vmax is the activity in the presence of saturating calmodulin, and v is the activity at each plotted calmodulin concentration. COS cell membrane preparations were solubilized and reconstituted as described previously (16Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cell membrane preparations containing 100–200 μg of protein were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube and resuspended in 80 μl of solubilization buffer containing 60 mm TES triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 240 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 400 μm EGTA, 10 mm NaN3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ouabain, 8 μg/ml oligomycin, 400 nmthapsigargin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. After 4 min, 320 μl of dilution buffer (same as solubilization buffer except 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine in place of Triton X-100) was added to the tube, and then 200 mg of Bio-Beads SM-2 were added. The tube was placed on a gel rocker for 1 h at 4 °C, the bulk of the Bio-Beads was removed by centrifugation, and the few residual beads were removed by filtration with a 0.45-μm spin filter. The assay medium contained 30 mm TES triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm ATP, 5 mm NaN3, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ouabain, 200 nmthapsigargin, 4 μg/ml oligomycin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm EGTA, enough CaCl2 to obtain 0.5 μm free Ca2+, ±235 nmcalmodulin, 0.2 mm MESG, and the coupled enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase at 1 unit/ml. In the presence of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, MESG is phosphorolyzed by inorganic phosphate to produce ribose-1-phosphate and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine. The time course of phosphorolysis of MESG was monitored on a Beckman DU 70 spectrophotometer as an increase in absorbance at 360 nm at 37 °C. Experiments to measure the rate of inactivation upon calmodulin removal were conducted in the same assay medium as for calmodulin activation. The enzyme was allowed to reach steady state at 0.5 μm free Ca2+ and 235 nm calmodulin, and then 10 μmcalmodulin-binding peptide RRKWQKTGHAVRAIGRLSS from chicken smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (17Enyedi Á.

W1093A was constructed in PMCA isoform h4b and transiently expressed in COS cells. COS cell membrane preparations (inside-out vesicles) were assayed for ATP-dependent incorporation of45Ca2+. Fig. 2shows that the full-length W1093A mutant has about 50% basal activity (in the absence of calmodulin), while the wild type has 15%. The W1093A mutant was also constructed in a truncated isoform 4b lacking the C-terminal 92 residues (ct92). ct92 ends with the last residue of the 28-residue calmodulin-binding domain and therefore lacks some downstream inhibitory determinants (18Enyedi Á. Verma A.K. Heim R. Adamo H.P. Filoteo A.G. Strehler E.E. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 41-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this, wild-type ct92 is also stimulated only 2-fold by calmodulin as was also previously shown (7Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The combination of truncation and W1093A mutation resulted in a pump with 70% of maximal activity in the absence of calmodulin. These experiments demonstrated that the W1093A mutation yielded a pump that was able to bind calmodulin and retained about half of the normal autoinhibitory properties of the calmodulin binding motif. The experiment combining truncation and the mutant showed that the inhibitory determinants destroyed by the two means were different since the inhibitory effects were additive. The higher basal activity of the W1093A mutants suggests a weaker interaction between the calmodulin-binding domain and the catalytic core. Since it was demonstrated that the W1093A mutant was indeed activated by calmodulin, kinetic experiments were performed to examine the steady state affinity for Ca2+-calmodulin. These curves were performed at 0.7 μm free Ca2+. Fig. 3 shows that the calmodulin affinity of W1093A was much lower than the wild type. The K0.5 for calmodulin was 144 nm for W1093A compared with 9 nm for the wild-type PMCA. The curves in Fig. 4 were performed with either 0 or 2 μm added calmodulin. Increasing Ca2+ results in more Ca2+ at the transport site and more of the activator Ca2+-calmodulin complex. W1093A showed a significant decrease in Ca2+ affinity relative to wild type in the presence of 2 μm total calmodulin. The K0.5 for Ca2+ was 0.35 ± 0.03 μm for the W1093A mutant compared with 0.19 ± 0.01 μm for the wild-type h4b. Since the activating species of PMCA is the Ca2+-calmodulin complex, the change in calmodulin affinity of the W1093A mutant was also reflected in a change in K0.5 for Ca2+ at constant calmodulin. These curves show that the differences in basal rates between the mutant and the wild type shown in Fig. 2 exist at all Ca2+ levels. Previous work has shown that the wild-type h4b has a slow activation rate (half-time of about 1 min) and an extremely slow inactivation rate (half-time of more than 20 min) (16Caride A.J. Elwess N.L. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi Á. Bajzer Z. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35227-35232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For comparison, we did similar studies on the W1093A mutant. To perform the pre-steady state activation experiments (Fig. 5), wild-type or W1093A pump was allowed to reach steady state in the presence of 500 nm Ca2+, then 235 nm calmodulin was added, and PMCA was allowed to proceed to a new, activated steady state. The activation rate constant (kact) was then obtained from the change in slope that occurred upon addition of calmodulin using the equation in the legend to Fig. 5. Wild-type h4b was activated by 235 nmcalmodulin with a k for the fitted curve of 0.0245 s−1, while the k obtained for W1093A was larger at 0.0574 s−1. The values of k yield kact of 1.043 × 105 m −1 s−1 for h4b and 2.443 × 105 m −1 s−1 for W1093A. We used the total concentration of calmodulin (235 nm) for the calculation of kact. The actual concentration of the activator Ca 42+-calmodulin would be dependent on the macroscopic constants for Ca2+ binding to calmodulin (19Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as cooperative events initiated by the binding of calmodulin with less than 4 Ca2+. The next experiment to examine the kinetic properties associated with tryptophan 1093 was to measure the rate of enzyme inactivation by calmodulin removal. Since the steady state affinity of W1093A for calmodulin was lower than that of the wild-type h4b and the rate of activation by calmodulin was faster, it could be assumed that the rate of inactivation would be much faster for W1093A than wild-type h4b. Inactivation experiments were performed by allowing the enzyme to reach steady state at 500 nm Ca2+ and 235 nm calmodulin, and then 10 μm competing calmodulin-binding peptide from myosin light chain kinase was mixed with the reaction. The myosin light chain kinase peptide itself has no direct effect on PMCA but will sequester any calmodulin that dissociates from PMCA, and the vast excess of peptide should prevent any significant rebinding of calmodulin to PMCA. Fig. 6 A shows the results of the inactivation experiment with wild-type h4b. The value obtained for kinact for h4b was 2.8 × 10−4s−1. The corresponding half-time for the reaction is 41 min. Fig. 6 B shows that the rate of inactivation of the W1093A mutant was much faster than the wild type with a kinact of 0.1 s−1 and a corresponding half-time of 7 s. From the data for kact and kinact of ATPase experiments it is possible to calculate dissociation constants for calmodulin and compare them to the apparent Kd values obtained from steady state Ca2+ transport. The calculated Kd for h4b from the pre-steady state experiments (performed at 500 nm Ca2+) is ∼3 nm. This was somewhat less than the apparent Kd of 9 nm obtained for the steady state experiments (performed at 700 nm Ca2+). The calculated Kd for W1093A is ∼407 nm compared with an apparent Kd of 144 nm. The agreement of these numbers is quite good considering that phosphatidylcholine membranes were used for the ATPase measurement, and native COS cell membrane vesicles were used for the Ca2+ transport assays. We consider the Kd values obtained from the pre-steady state data to be more accurate because PMCA is enriched about 10-fold by the reconstitution, and the Ca2+concentration is better controlled with the buffer system used for the pre-steady state assays. The data presented here show that the W1093A mutant differs from the wild type in three ways. The first is that the mutant has a less effective interaction of the calmodulin-binding domain with the catalytic core so that it retained only half of the normal autoinhibitory properties. The second is that the rate of activation by calmodulin is faster for the mutant, and the third is that the mutant exhibits a much faster dissociation of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex. The basal activity in the absence of calmodulin is controlled by the interaction of the calmodulin-binding domain with the catalytic core. The degree of autoinhibition is also affected by the downstream regulatory region (7Verma A.K. Enyedi Á. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1687-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of calmodulin, an equilibrium exists between closed and open conformations (in the closed conformation, the calmodulin-binding domain interacts with the catalytic core, while in the open conformation it does not). The catalytic core and calmodulin may be viewed as competing for the open conformation of the calmodulin-binding domain. Changing tryptophan 1093 to alanine increased the basal activity of the pump (in the absence of calmodulin); in the wild type the basal activity was 15% of the maximal calmodulin-stimulated activity, while in the mutant it was 50%. This indicates that the mutant pump was shifted more toward the open conformation, and thus the calmodulin-binding domain was more accessible to calmodulin. As was mentioned in the discussion of Fig. 2(see “Results”), the tryptophan side chain was responsible for ∼50% of the autoinhibitory properties of the calmodulin-binding domain. This confirms what had been seen with the peptide studies that show that tryptophan 1093 has a vital role in the autoinhibitory interaction as well as being an important anchor for calmodulin binding. The displacement of PMCA toward the open state by the mutation should also make the calmodulin-binding domain of the mutant more accessible to Ca2+-calmodulin. This accessibility may be reflected in an acceleration in the rate of activation by Ca2+-calmodulin. Such an effect was observed for the W1093A mutation, which increased the rate of activation ∼2.5-fold. The effect of opening the pump is probably adequate to account entirely for the activation rate increase without needing to invoke any effect of tryptophan 1093 in calmodulin recognition. In contrast with the small effect of the mutant on activation, the mutant greatly accelerates the inactivation (350-fold). This large effect indicates that tryptophan 1093 has a major role in slowing dissociation of Ca2+-calmodulin from the pump. The small role of tryptophan 1093 in the initial interaction with calmodulin is rather surprising because of the dominant role of this tryptophan in stabilizing the fully formed complex with calmodulin. The NMR solution structure showed the tryptophan interacting with nine residues of calmodulin compared with only three calmodulin residues interacting with the next most important residues in the calmodulin-binding domain of the pump (9Elshorst B. Hennig M. Forsterling H. Diener A. Maurer M. Schulte P. Schwalbe H. Griesinger C. Krebs J. Schmid H. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12320-12332Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These nine interactions evidently contribute very strongly to the stabilization of the pump-calmodulin complex and hinder its dissociation. However, the initial binding of calmodulin must involve recognition of a number of important features among which the tryptophan is not a major contributor."
https://openalex.org/W2125902126,"Endothelial cell proliferation is required for angiogenesis in both embryonic and adult tissues. In rat brain tumors, it has recently been shown that the nuclear protein pigpen is expressed selectively in endothelial cells of developing microvasculature but not in the established peritumoral vessels (Blank, M., Weinschenk, T., Priemer, M., and Schluesener, H. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 16464–16468). This finding suggests that pigpen may be important for promoting the undifferentiated, or “angiogenic” endothelial cell phenotype. Our studies show that pigpen protein and mRNA are expressed in actively dividing endothelial cells and down-regulated as they become confluent. Protein distribution is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We conclude that this expression pattern is important for and not simply ancillary to proliferation because nuclear microinjection of anti-pigpen Fab fragments inhibited endothelial cell division. Moreover, expression of the proliferating cell marker Ki67 was inhibited in antibody-injected cells. The absence of Ki67 suggests exit from rather than arrest within (for example, at the G1/S interface) the cell cycle. Together with earlier observations on the structure and expression of this molecule, our data support the hypothesis that pigpen helps regulate endothelial cell differentiation state.

Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels from existing vasculature. It begins early and continues throughout embryonic development, extending early rudiments of the vascular system to meet the nutritive requirements of growing tissues. In adult tissues angiogenesis is a relatively rare and tightly regulated event. Endothelial cells (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: ECendothelial cell(s)ABamiloride + bumetanideCBcoiled bodies 1The abbreviations used are: ECendothelial cell(s)ABamiloride + bumetanideCBcoiled bodies must therefore be transformed from a quiescent, non-proliferative state to an undifferentiated/proliferative phenotype that provides the building blocks and framework for new vessels. This process occurs normally during wound healing and cyclic reproductive events but can also be triggered by a variety of pathological conditions resulting in considerable tissue damage (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7206) Google Scholar). New blood vessel development is critical for tumor growth and metastasis, for example. In the eye, angiogenesis is involved in more than 20 disorders (2Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including neovascular glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. endothelial cell(s) amiloride + bumetanide coiled bodies endothelial cell(s) amiloride + bumetanide coiled bodies Great progress has been made in our understanding of extracellular factors governing angiogenesis. Control of EC phenotype is generally thought to be regulated by a balance of stimulators and inhibitors. We have a great deal more to learn about the downstream effectors of angiogenesis, however, especially the nuclear factors that convert incoming signals into the new genetic program. Induction of several well known nuclear regulatory molecules has been shown to accompany angiogenic stimulation. For example, analogues of the immediate early genes, c-fos, c-jun, and egr-1 are induced in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated EC (3Hla T. Jackson A.Q. Appleby S.B. Maciag T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 260: 227-229Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induces EDG-2, a human homologue of the Xenopus G10 protein. Induction of the DNA-binding homeobox protein Hox D3 has been shown not only to accompany but to trigger expression of the angiogenic phenotype in avian EC (4Boudreau N. Andrews C. Srebrow A. Ravanpay A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Still there are many gaps to be filled. It is certain that other characterized regulatory proteins will be fitted into this scheme, and equally likely that new ones will be discovered. There is evidence to suggest that the nuclear protein pigpen functions in the proliferative phase of angiogenesis. This molecule displays a transcription activation domain as well as consensus motifs associated with RNA binding (5Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the latter case, we have evidence to suggest that pigpen interacts selectively with mRNAs, notably those of positive cell cycle regulators such as Bub1, E2F4, and katanin (6Alliegro M.C. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Importantly, it was recently shown that pigpen is highly expressed in rat brain tumor microvessels but is absent in mature brain vasculature, even in zones immediately adjacent to the tumor (7Blank M. Weinschenk T. Priemer M. Schluesener H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16464-16468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Together with other observations on the up-regulation of pigpen in wounded vascular cell monolayers (5Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Blank M. Weinschenk T. Priemer M. Schluesener H. J. Biol.

Embryol. 1999; 200: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), these data suggest that pigpen's expression pattern underlies a functional role in regulating EC phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that pigpen is important for cell division by microinjection of anti-pigpen Fab fragments into the nuclei of EC in proliferating cultures. More than 200 individual cells were injected, tracked, and assayed for progression through mitosis. We found that cell division was inhibited by ∼50%. Anti-pigpen arrested cells appeared to be thrown out of the cell cycle as judged by the absence of the ubiquitous cycling cell marker Ki67. Our results suggest that pigpen expression is not only coincident with proliferation in EC but is important for maintaining the proliferative/undifferentiated phenotype required for the early stages of angiogenesis. Fetal bovine aortic EC used in this study were isolated according to the methods of Fenselau and Mello (9Fenselau A. Mello R.J. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 3269-3273PubMed Google Scholar) and have been characterized and described previously (10Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Cragoe E.J. Glaser B.M. J. Exp. Zool. 1993; 267: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on sterile glass coverslips in minimal essential medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. In some experiments, cells were arrested in G1 with a combination of amiloride + bumetanide (AB) as described by Panet et al. (11Panet R. Snyder D. Atlan H. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells were harvested by trypsinization, replated at 1:5 dilution on sterile glass coverslips, and cultured in standard 6-well tissue culture plates overnight. A fresh (100× stock) solution of 100 mmamiloride and 10 mm bumetanide in Me2SO (Sigma) was prepared prior to each experiment. Tissue culture medium in the wells was replaced with 2 ml of fresh media, and 20 μl of AB stock was added to bring the final concentrations to 1 mm amiloride, 100 μm bumetanide, and 1% Me2SO. Control samples were treated with 1% Me2SO alone. Cells were then cultured in AB long enough to traverse one cycle and ensure uniform arrest in G1 (20 h) and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. The specificity of polyclonal anti-pigpen was examined by Western blot analysis using methods described previously (5Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Whole EC lysates were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-pigpen or preimmune serum from the same rabbit. The detection system used was a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody with hydrogen peroxide and 1,4-dichloronaphthol substrates. India ink was used to stain total protein in parallel lanes. The results of Western analysis are shown in Fig. 1. No protein bands were detected with preimmune serum at dilutions ranging from 1/500 to 1/5000. A single band migrating at 67 kDa (predicted migration for pigpen) was detected in anti-pigpen probed lanes over the same dilution range. For immunohistochemistry of cultured cells, culture medium was removed with three brief rinses in PBS prior to fixation in 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS (5 min) followed immediately by permeabilization and post-fixation in 0.5% Triton X-100 (3 min) and 100% methanol (8 min, −20 °C). Three 10-min rinses in PBS were followed by a 30-min incubation in blocking solution (1.5% goat serum in PBS) and 60 min in primary antibody. Anti-pigpen was diluted at 1/500 in blocking solution. Monoclonal anti-Ki67, purchased from Immunotech (Marseille, France), is supplied in its own blocking solution and was used directly from the bottle. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). IgGs for microinjection were purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography and reduced to Fab fragments by papain digestion as described by Goding (12Goding J.W. Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1986Google Scholar). Fab fragments were collected in the effluent of a subsequent protein A affinity column and pressure-dialyzed into microinjection buffer using Centricon microfiltration devices (Amicon). The IgG concentration in microinjection buffer was 1 mg/ml. Cells cultured on CELLocate (Eppendorf) glass coverslips were microinjected using an Eppendorf automated microinjection system with duration and pressure settings of 0.5 s and 30 hectopascals, respectively. The microinjection buffer has been described by O'Keefe et al. (13O'Keefe R.T. Mayeda A. Sadowski C.L. Krainer A.R. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and contains 15 mg/ml lysine-fixable 70-kDa Texas Red-conjugated dextrans, 10 mmNaH2PO4, and 70 mm KCl, pH 7.2. Following microinjection cells are washed two times in minimum essential medium + 15% fetal calf serum and cultured under standard conditions until fixed for subsequent analysis. Pre-immune Fab fragments were injected under identical conditions as a control in all experiments. Pigpen is expressed ubiquitously in proliferating EC cultures; however, both the protein and its mRNA are sharply down-regulated when cells become confluent (Fig. 2). These observations are consistent with other reports linking pigpen expression to the undifferentiated phenotype both in vitro and in vivo (5Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 7Blank M. Weinschenk T. Priemer M. Schluesener H. J. Biol.

Pigpen is expressed at all stages of the cell cycle, but its distribution is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (Figs. 3 and4). In G1 there are ∼17 pigpen-containing foci (coiled bodies; CB) per cell. This number declines to 10 during progression through S and G2 phases. During this same period nuclear envelope staining appears more prominent. Pigpen foci reach a minimum average of 1 per cell during anaphase and then begin to increase in number again before the completion of M phase. Two observations consistent with past findings were that: 1) pigpen-containing CB can be found outside the nuclear zone during late telophase (and indeed may persist in the cytoplasm, as may be noted in Fig. 2B); 2) throughout M phase pigpen-containing CB seem to associate preferentially with the mediolateral, poleward aspect of chromosomes. It is possible that this localization is passive in some respect, e.g. if CB are excluded from the metaphase figure and remain pressed against the periphery of poleward-moving chromosomes. However, their initial juxtachromosomal positioning in metaphase, when net chromosomal movement is zero or is directed toward the metaphase plate, would appear to discount this possibility and suggest some bona fide interaction.Figure 4Cyclic fluctuation in the population of pigpen-containing coiled bodies. Data were derived by random selection of at least 100 Ki67-staged cells in three separate trials (range from 100 to 103 cells). Vertical bars represent standard errors. Data for M phase are divided into prophase (P), metaphase (M), anaphase (A), and telophase (T). All variations from stage to successive stage were determined to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) by analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given the multifunctional nature of pigpen (including transcription activation and RNA binding domains), its down-regulation in quiescent EC, and its ubiquitous expression in cycling cells, it is a reasonable hypothesis that it functions in maintenance of the proliferating (dedifferentiated) EC phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of nuclear-injected anti-pigpen antibodies on EC proliferation. The microinjection buffer included 70-kDa Texas red-labeled dextrans that both enabled tracking of individual cells on the day following injection and provided a simple means to assay for progression through M phase via fluorescence redistribution. In two experiments, slightly over 200 cells were injected with anti-pigpen Fab fragments or pre-immune Fab fragments as a control. The injected cells were cultured for 20 h to permit at least one round of cell division, then fixed. Divided cells were identified by cytoplasmic fluorescence due to redistribution of dextrans upon nuclear envelope breakdown (Fig. 5). In cells that had not entered M phase, dextrans remained compartmentalized in the nucleus. We found that the difference between control and experimental groups was marked (Fig. 6A); control cultures exhibited almost twice the number of divided cells compared with those injected with anti-pigpen Fab fragments.Figure 6Microinjection of anti-pigpen inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. Anti-pigpen Fab fragments inhibited EC division by ∼50% (A). This figure includes only cells showing no redistribution of Texas Red-labeled dextrans (i.e. arrested prior to prophase). In addition, a marked increase in the number of binucleate cells (24%) was observed in anti-pigpen versus pre-immune injected cells (B). The incidence of binucleate cells in the latter group was identical to that observed in uninjected cultured EC (5%). Total inhibition, combining cells that failed to undergo karyokinesis with those progressing through karyokinesis but failing to undergo cytokinesis, is ∼72%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It may be that our estimate for inhibition is conservative, depending on whether or not pigpen functions during a discrete phase of the cell cycle. If pigpen were required during G1, for example, then cells injected during S or G2 would likely progress through mitosis and be tallied among the uninhibited. This may be reflected in the relatively high incidence of binucleate cells observed in the experimental group (24 versus 5% for controls; Fig. 6B). One explanation for this finding is that some cells were injected too late in the cell cycle to block karyokinesis but soon enough to prevent progression through cytokinesis. It is also possible that pigpen affects both karyokinesis and cytokinesis through relatively independent mechanisms and that the latter was more sensitive to antibody injection. Regardless of the precise mechanism, if these cells that failed to undergo cytokinesis are added to those blocked prior to karyokinesis, the level of inhibition resulting from injection of anti-pigpen approximates 72%. Ki67 is a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells but not in non-cycling (G0) cells. Similar to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and several other well characterized molecules, Ki67 exhibits a repeating pattern of regulated expression and redistribution during the cell cycle (14Scholzen T. Gerdes J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3486) Google Scholar). It has been used extensively as a marker in human tumor diagnostics (the Ki67 labeling index) and as a reliable cell cycle monitor (see Fig. 3, for example). During G1, Ki67 is present in the nucleoplasm at low levels in a fine, granular pattern. In S and G2 phases Ki67 becomes highly concentrated in nucleoli, and in M phase anti-Ki67 stains chromosomes intensely. EC arrested in G1 with AB exhibit a Ki67 expression pattern consistent with the G1 conformation seen in cycling cells. An example is shown in Fig. 7A to be compared with arrest induced by anti-pigpen injection. In the latter cells, Ki67 expression was observed to be greatly attenuated and often completely ablated (Fig. 7, B–D). The lack of Ki67 in these cells suggests that they are not arrested within the cell cycle, as are AB-arrested cells, but have exited the cell cycle and entered a more differentiated state. We examined the distribution of two other nuclear antigens in injected cells including the nucleolar protein fibrillarin and the spliceosomal protein SC35. In both cases the distribution and apparent expression level appeared indistinguishable from control (pre-immune) or non-injected cells (Fig. 8). These results suggest that the effects of anti-pigpen injection on Ki67 expression and EC proliferation were not likely due to nonspecific or widespread effects on nuclear organization. Pigpen's highly regulated expression pattern both in vitro (5Alliegro M.C. Alliegro M.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Kohler A. Jostarndt-Fogen K.

Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), provides compelling circumstantial evidence that it is a regulator of EC phenotype. Additional evidence that this molecule is involved in angiogenesis was recently reported by Blank et al. (7Blank M. Weinschenk T. Priemer M. Schluesener H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16464-16468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) using an experimental rat brain glioma model. Pigpen was highly expressed in newly forming microvessels within the tumor mass but was notably absent from mature vessels, even in peritumoral zones. In this report we provide the first experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that pigpen plays a role in angiogenesis via regulation of EC proliferation. We found that pigpen expression is not only restricted to proliferating EC, but cell cycle progression can be substantially perturbed by microinjection of anti-pigpen antibodies in the nucleus of proliferating EC. Without EC proliferation, developing tissues, whether embryonic or pathologic, lack the primary building blocks and scaffolding required for new blood vessel development. Given the variety of structural motifs the protein exhibits and its subcellular distribution, pigpen could exert its influence at multiple levels from gene activation to RNA processing or transport. Moreover, its expression throughout the cell cycle, marked by a regulated distribution pattern, make it possible for pigpen to play different roles at different times. Identifying and following the biogenesis of gene products downstream from pigpen will enable us to define its function(s).
