https://openalex.org/W1500843579,"The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that augments the proinflammatory response by increasing the generation and cellular release of key cytokines. Specifically, the NALP3 inflammasome requires two-step signaling, priming and activation, to be functional to release the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. The priming process, through unknown mechanisms, increases the protein levels of NALP3 and pro-IL-1β in cells. Here we show that LPS increases the NALP3 protein lifespan without significantly altering steady-state mRNA in human cells. LPS exposure reduces the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal processing of NALP3 by inducing levels of an E3 ligase component, FBXO3, which targets FBXL2. The latter is an endogenous mediator of NALP3 degradation. FBXL2 recognizes Trp-73 within NALP3 for interaction and targets Lys-689 within NALP3 for ubiquitin ligation and degradation. A unique small molecule inhibitor of FBXO3 restores FBXL2 levels, resulting in decreased NALP3 protein levels in cells and, thereby, reducing the release of IL-1β and IL-18 in human inflammatory cells after NALP3 activation. Our findings uncover NALP3 as a molecular target for FBXL2 and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the inflammasome may serve as a platform for preclinical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W637285630,"Unconventional gas drilling (UGD) has enabled extraordinarily rapid growth in the extraction of natural gas. Despite frequently expressed public concern, human health studies have not kept pace. We investigated the association of proximity to UGD in the Marcellus Shale formation and perinatal outcomes in a retrospective cohort study of 15,451 live births in Southwest Pennsylvania from 2007-2010. Mothers were categorized into exposure quartiles based on inverse distance weighted (IDW) well count; least exposed mothers (first quartile) had an IDW well count less than 0.87 wells per mile, while the most exposed (fourth quartile) had 6.00 wells or greater per mile. Multivariate linear (birth weight) or logistical (small for gestational age (SGA) and prematurity) regression analyses, accounting for differences in maternal and child risk factors, were performed. There was no significant association of proximity and density of UGD with prematurity. Comparison of the most to least exposed, however, revealed lower birth weight (3323 ± 558 vs 3344 ± 544 g) and a higher incidence of SGA (6.5 vs 4.8%, respectively; odds ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.63). While the clinical significance of the differences in birth weight among the exposure groups is unclear, the present findings further emphasize the need for larger studies, in regio-specific fashion, with more precise characterization of exposure over an extended period of time to evaluate the potential public health significance of UGD."
https://openalex.org/W2239018980,"The ""Latescibacteria"" (formerly WS3), member of the Fibrobacteres-Chlorobi-Bacteroidetes (FCB) superphylum, represents a ubiquitous candidate phylum found in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. Recently, single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) representing the ""Latescibacteria"" were obtained from the anoxic monimolimnion layers of Sakinaw Lake (British Columbia, Canada), and anoxic sediments of a coastal lagoon (Etoliko lagoon, Western Greece). Here, we present a detailed in-silico analysis of the four SAGs to gain some insights on their metabolic potential and apparent ecological roles. Metabolic reconstruction suggests an anaerobic fermentative mode of metabolism, as well as the capability to degrade multiple polysaccharides and glycoproteins that represent integral components of green (Charophyta and Chlorophyta) and brown (Phaeophycaea) algae cell walls (pectin, alginate, ulvan, fucan, hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins), storage molecules (starch and trehalose), and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The analyzed SAGs also encode dedicated transporters for the uptake of produced sugars and amino acids/oligopeptides, as well as an extensive machinery for the catabolism of all transported sugars, including the production of a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) to sequester propionaldehyde, a toxic intermediate produced during fucose and rhamnose metabolism. Finally, genes for the formation of gas vesicles, flagella, type IV pili, and oxidative stress response were found, features that could aid in cellular association with algal detritus. Collectively, these results indicate that the analyzed ""Latescibacteria"" mediate the turnover of multiple complex organic polymers of algal origin that reach deeper anoxic/microoxic habitats in lakes and lagoons. The implications of such process on our understanding of niche specialization in microbial communities mediating organic carbon turnover in stratified water bodies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1531285572,"Plant genomes contain a large number of genes encoding for berberine bridge enzyme (BBE)-like enzymes. Despite the widespread occurrence and abundance of this protein family in the plant kingdom, the biochemical function remains largely unexplored. In this study, we have expressed two members of the BBE-like enzyme family from Arabidopsis thaliana in the host organism Komagataella pastoris. The two proteins, termed AtBBE-like 13 and AtBBE-like 15, were purified, and their catalytic properties were determined. In addition, AtBBE-like 15 was crystallized and structurally characterized by x-ray crystallography. Here, we show that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of aromatic allylic alcohols, such as coumaryl, sinapyl, and coniferyl alcohol, to the corresponding aldehydes and that AtBBE-like 15 adopts the same fold as vanillyl alcohol oxidase as reported previously for berberine bridge enzyme and other FAD-dependent oxidoreductases. Further analysis of the substrate range identified coniferin, the glycosylated storage form of coniferyl alcohol, as a substrate of the enzymes, whereas other glycosylated monolignols were rather poor substrates. A detailed analysis of the motifs present in the active sites of the BBE-like enzymes in A. thaliana suggested that 14 out of 28 members of the family might catalyze similar reactions. Based on these findings, we propose a novel role of BBE-like enzymes in monolignol metabolism that was previously not recognized for this enzyme family.

Flavoproteins are a large and diverse protein family employing the FAD cofactor for catalysis. Among them the berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) 2The abbreviations used are: BBEberberine bridge enzymeTHCAΔ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthaseVAOvanillyl alcohol oxidaseGOOXglucooligosaccharide oxidase. -like proteins (pfam 08031) can be set apart due to their unusual bicovalent attachment of the FAD cofactor. The namesake of this protein family is BBE from Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) that catalyzes the formation of the so-called “berberine bridge” by oxidation of the N-methyl group of (S)-reticuline yielding (S)-scoulerine (1Winkler A.

This step constitutes a branch point in the biosynthesis of numerous isoquinoline alkaloids (2Facchini P.J. Penzes C. Johnson A.G. Bull D.

In recent years, a large number of genes encoding BBE-like enzymes have been identified in plants and bacteria in the course of genome sequencing efforts. The number of BBE-like genes in individual plant species varies considerably from a single gene in the moss Physcomitrella patens to 64 in the western poplar (Populus trichocarpa) (4Wallner S. Dully C. Daniel B. Macheroux P. Hille R. Miller S.M. Palfrey B. Handbook of Flavoproteins, Oxidases, Dehydrogenases and Related Systems. Vol. 1. De Gruyter, Berlin2013Google Scholar). In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, 28 BBE-like genes were identified (termed AtBBE-like 1–28 (4Wallner S. Dully C. Daniel B. Macheroux P. Hille R. Miller S.M. Palfrey B. Handbook of Flavoproteins, Oxidases, Dehydrogenases and Related Systems. Vol. 1. De Gruyter, Berlin2013Google Scholar)). However, the role of these BBE homologs in A. thaliana and most of the other plants is unknown, as most do not synthesize alkaloids of the benzylisoquinoline family. Examination of microarray data (5Winter D. Vinegar B. Nahal H. Ammar R. Wilson G.V. Provart N.J. An “Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph” browser for exploring and analyzing large-scale biological data sets.PLoS One. 2007; 2: e718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar) revealed the expression of AtBBE-like genes during certain developmental stages, such as root elongation and maturation, and proliferation as well as embryonal development (Table 1). Similarly, osmotic stress and pathogen attack were shown to cause up-regulation of AtBBE-likes by up to 400-fold. This up-regulation was also seen in other plants, such as citrus fruit and poplar (6González-Candelas L. Alamar S. Sánchez-Torres P. Zacarías L. Marcos J.F.

The role in pathogen defense appears to be related to a carbohydrate oxidase activity that was reported previously for tobacco (nectarin V), sunflower, and lettuce (8Carter C.J. Thornburg R.W.

Similar oxidation reactions occur in the biosynthesis of antibiotics generated in various bacterial species, such as Streptomyces (10Alexeev I. Sultana A. Mäntsälä P. Niemi J. Schneider G.

However, the role of BBE homologs in plant development remains enigmatic.TABLE 1Expression of AtBBE-homologs in plantaSubgroupNameMost significant expression value/up-regulationSecond significant expression value/up-regulationLocalization, MS/MSLocus1AtBBE-like 18822, seed linear cotyledonUnknownAT4G20820.11AtBBE-like 271117, rootUnknownAT5G44410.11AtBBE-like 286000, shift dark to light927, quiescent center rootExtracellularAT5G44440.12AtBBE-like 32457/438-fold osmotic stress seedling2318/457-fold, infection P. infestansEndoplasmic reticulumAT1G26380.12AtBBE-like 42070/78-fold infection, P. syringae391, root regenerationUnknownAT1G26390.12AtBBE-like 5665, cotyledons475, cotyledon greensUnknownAT1G26400.12AtBBE-like 6604/42-fold, osmotic stress278/36-fold infection, P. syringaeUnknownAT1G26410.12AtBBE-like 71562/412-fold, osmotic stress800/163-fold, mock infectionUnknownAT1G26420.12AtBBE-like 177772, micropylar endospermUnknownAT4G20800.13AtBBE-like 104899, lateral root cap912/57-fold, mock infectionUnknownAT1G30720.13AtBBE-like 114988, root epidermis762/10-fold, infection P. syringaeExtracellularAT1G30730.14AtBBE-like 97582, mature pollenUnknownAT1G30710.14AtBBE-like 1450, seedUnknownAT1G34575.14AtBBE-like 163682, root maturation zone1537, stigma and ovariesUnknownAT2G34810.15AtBBE-like 111,626, pollen5509, mature pollenPlasma membrane, GolgiAT1G01980.15AtBBE-like 25088, pollen2000, pollen tubesUnknownAT1G11770.15AtBBE-like 82557, root maturation zone1157/246-fold infection, P. syringaeUnknownAT1G30700.15AtBBE-like 12642, endospermUnknownAT1G30740.15AtBBE-like 204000, root elongation zone1394/10-fold infection P. syringaeExtracellular, plasma membraneAT4G20830.25AtBBE-like 21973, root elongation zonePlasma membraneAT4G20840.16AtBBE-like 132144, lateral root initiation1594, xylem root maturation zoneUnknownAT1G30760.16AtBBE-like 154927, xylem root439, seed stage 8 curledExtracellular, plasma membraneAT2G34790.16AtBBE-like 2432,075, lateral root cap1412, cotyledonExtracellularAT5G44380.16AtBBE-like 25491, procambium root164/5-fold infection P. syringaeExtracellularAT5G44390.16AtBBE-like 26604/5-fold osmotic stress root250/3-fold infection P. syringaeExtracellularAT5G44400.17AtBBE-like 221641, lateral root initiation1427/13-fold infection P. syringaePlasma membrane, cytosolAT4G20860.17AtBBE-like 23824, root649, seed cotyledon heart stageUnknownAT5G44360.1 Open table in a new tab berberine bridge enzyme Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase vanillyl alcohol oxidase glucooligosaccharide oxidase. For this study, we have chosen AtBBE-like 15 (At2g34790) for further studies into the role of the BBE-like enzyme family in plants because gene disruption resulted in defects in female gametophyte development (i.e. unfused polar nuclei and endosperm development arrest) (13Pagnussat G.C.

Genetic and molecular identification of genes required for female gametophyte development and function in Arabidopsis.Development. 2005; 132: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mass spectrometric analysis has shown that AtBBE-like 15 is located in the cell wall and thus might participate in as yet undefined reactions relevant for the formation of the cell wall (14Hooper C.M. Tanz S.K. Castleden I.R. Vacher M.A. Small I.D. Millar A.H. SUBAcon: a consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular localization data of the Arabidopsis proteome.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 3356-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, we have selected AtBBE-like 13 (At1g30760) for further analysis due to its close sequence relationship of 81% identity to AtBBE-like 15. Structural analysis of recombinant AtBBE-like 15 by x-ray crystallography confirmed a topology similar to that of berberine bridge enzyme from E. californica (EcBBE) and Δ1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (THCA synthase) from Cannabis sativa (15Shoyama Y. Tamada T. Kurihara K. Takeuchi A. Taura F. Arai S. Blaber M. Shoyama Y. Morimoto S. Kuroki R.

A concerted mechanism for berberine bridge enzyme.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, composition and architecture of the active site of AtBBE-like 15 indicated distinct catalytic properties. To identify potential substrates, we screened a small compound library with regard to its effect on the protein's thermal stability. This approach produced several hits and allowed the identification of cinnamyl alcohol as a lead structure. Further analysis showed that the p-hydroxylated derivatives of cinnamyl alcohol, i.e. the monolignols p-coumaryl-, coniferyl-, and sinapyl alcohol are rapidly oxidized to their corresponding aldehydes. Furthermore, the β-O-glycosylated form of coniferyl alcohol (coniferin) is also accepted as a substrate. Because monolignols and their β-glycosylated derivatives (coniferin, syringin, and p-coumaryl-β-glycoside) are important building blocks and monolignol storage forms, respectively, the catalytic reactions performed by AtBBE-like 13 and AtBBE-like 15 constitute a novel link between the phenylpropanoid pathway and the formation of plant polymerization products, such as lignin and suberin. The characteristic active site found in AtBBE-like 13 and AtBBE-like 15 is conserved in the majority of BBE-like enzymes in A. thaliana (14 of 28) suggesting that they either exhibit different substrate preferences or have distinct spatial (e.g. different plant tissues) or temporal (e.g. in response to pathogens or herbivores) functions in planta. All chemicals were from Sigma and were of the highest grade commercially available. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Fermentas (Waltham, MA). Nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column material was from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). Synthetic genes coding for AtBBE-like 15 and AtBBE-like 13 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., with codon usage optimized for Komagataella pastoris. The proteins were expressed using Komagataella pastoris as expression host, according to the EasySelectTM Pichia expression kit provided by Invitrogen. The genes were adapted to the K. pastoris codon usage, and a C-terminal His tag was added. SignalP was used to identify the native signal sequence of 30 and 27 amino acids for AtBBE-like 13 and AtBBE-like 15, respectively (17Petersen T.N. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7096) Google Scholar). The genes lacking the signal sequence were cloned into pPICZα vector® (Invitrogen) using standard techniques. K. pastoris strain KM71H was transformed with the pPICK-PDI vector harboring the gene for the protein-disulfide isomerase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The modified KM71H strain was transformed with the linearized [pPICZα-AtBBE-like 13] or [pPICZα-AtBBE-like 15] construct using electroporation. Optimal expression strains were identified using the method proposed by Weis et al. (18Weis R. Luiten R. Skranc W. Schwab H. Wubbolts M. Glieder A. Reliable high-throughput screening with Pichia pastoris by limiting yeast cell death phenomena.FEMS Yeast Res. 2004; 5: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Expression was carried out using a BBI CT5-2 fermenter (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) using a basal salt minimal medium as described by Schrittwieser et al. (19Schrittwieser J.H. Resch V. Wallner S. Lienhart W.D. Sattler J.H. Resch J. Macheroux P. Kroutil W. Biocatalytic organic synthesis of optically pure (S)-scoulerine and berbine and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids.J. Org. Chem. 2011; 76: 6703-6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After 96 h of methanol induction, the pH was set to 8.0 with sodium hydroxide, and imidazole was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The cells were removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 50 ml of nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow material at 4 °C for 45 min. Then the affinity material was packed into a column and washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl and 150 mm imidazole. Fractions containing AtBBE-like 15 were concentrated using Amicon Ultracentrifugal filter units and subsequently loaded on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column using an Äkta system and separated using 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride. The purity of purified protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The final yield from 3.5 liters of fermentation supernatant was 520 mg of purified protein. The large scale expression of AtBBE-like 13 was conducted as described for AtBBE-like15. In contrast to AtBBE-like 15, AtBBE-like 13 was not secreted, and hence the protein was isolated from cells and not the cultivation medium. Briefly, the cell pellet was harvested and redissolved (1:3 w/v) in cell lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), disrupted by zirconia/silica beads using a Merckenschlager homogenizer. The lysate was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation (18000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), filtered, and incubated with nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow material (GE Healthcare). The column was packed with the Sepharose material, and after extensive washing (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), the protein was eluted with elution buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Subsequent purification was performed as described for AtBBE-like 15. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions of the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for site-directed mutagenesis. The pPICZα-AtBBE-like 15 vector was used as template for the polymerase chain reaction. The introduction of the desired codon causing a change of leucine in position 182 to valine was verified by sequencing. Transformation of the gene was performed as described before. Expression of the mutated gene and purification of the AtBBE-like 15 L182V variant was performed as described for wild-type AtBBE-like 15. Initial crystal screening of AtBBE-like 15(27–532) was performed with an Oryx8 robot (Douglas Instruments, Berkshire, UK) using commercially available Index (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and JCSG+ (Molecular Dimensions, Suffolk, UK) screens. Screening was performed in Swissci triple well plates (Molecular Dimensions) using the sitting drop method with a reservoir volume of 33 μl. Drops of 1 μl were pipetted in a 1:1 ratio of protein and reservoir solution with two different protein stock solutions, 22 and 50 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm sodium chloride, respectively. Plates were sealed with the thermal seal A sealing films (Sigma) and were incubated at 289 K. First crystals appeared after 1 week in JCSG+ screen condition 1–14 (0.2 m sodium thiocyanate and 20% w/v PEG 3350) with the higher protein concentration. Crystals from this drop were pipetted out and crushed in 100 μl of the original 1–14 solution and used as a seeding stock. Cross-seeding setups (20D'Arcy A. Villard F. Marsh M. An automated microseed matrix-screening method for protein crystallization.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) were performed in the same manner as initial screening with drops consisting of 0.5 μl of protein stock solution (37 mg/ml), 0.2 μl of the seeding stock, and 0.5 μl of the JCSG+ screen solutions from the reservoir. The best diffracting crystals appeared after 4 and a half weeks in a serial dilution setup done manually in Crystal Clear duo plates for sitting drop (Douglas Instruments). The 1.2-μl drops consisted of 0.5 μl of protein stock solution (36 mg/ml), 0.2 μl of the seeding stock, and 0.5 μl of the JCSG+ screen condition 2-33 (0.1 m potassium thiocyanate and 30% w/v PEG 2000 MME) from the reservoir. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at Elettra (Trieste) without additional cryoprotectant. Data processing was performed with the XDS program package (21Kabsch W. Integration, scaling, space-group assignment and post-refinement.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). Unit cell parameters and assigned space groups as well as data statistics are shown in Table 3. The solvent content was estimated based on the calculated Matthews coefficient (22Kantardjieff K.A. Rupp B.

Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser (23McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14440) Google Scholar) using the structure of EcBBE as the search template. Structure refinement was done with Phenix (24Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.-W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J.

Coot: Model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar). The program Readyset! (included in Phenix) was used to generate restraints for metal coordination and the PEG fragment included in the refinement. In total, three sodium and one potassium ion were found to bind to the protein surface without structural impact. The TLSMD server was used to generate partitioning groups (three for chain A and four for chain B) to improve refinement (26Painter J. Merritt E.A. Optimal description of a protein structure in terms of multiple groups undergoing TLS motion.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Several refinement cycles were done until all visible residues were assigned, and no significant changes in R and Rfree were observed. Structure validation was performed using MolProbity (27Chen V.B.

Chain B starts with residue Gln-30 and extends to Gly-532. Some residues in the N-terminal region could not be modeled into the electron density most likely due to their high flexibility (Val-43 and Ser-44 in chain A as well Gln-40, Ser-41, and Asp-42 in chain B). In addition, no clear electron density was visible for a loop region (residues 301–305) in both chains. Thermofluor experiments were performed using a CFX Connect real time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The experiments were performed using Sypro® Orange as fluorescent dye in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 7.0. Stock solutions of all substrates were prepared in water with a concentration of 10 mg/ml. For substrates with a lower solubility, a saturated solution was used. The total volume in each well was 25 μl with a protein concentration of 0.4 and 2 mg/ml substrate. The starting temperature of 20 °C was kept for 5 min and then the temperature was increased at a rate of 0.5 °C/min to 95 °C. Melting temperatures were determined using the program Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3.0. Reductive and oxidative half-reactions were determined with a stopped-flow device (SF-61DX2, TgK Scientific, UK) at 25 °C under anoxic conditions in a glove box (Belle Technology, Weymouth, UK). Oxygen was removed from the sample by flushing with nitrogen and subsequent incubation of the samples in the glove box for 1 h. Spectral changes of the flavin cofactor were followed at a wavelength of 450 nm using a KinetaScanT diode array detector (MG-6560, Hi-Tech) employing the Kinetic Studio software (TgK Scientific, UK). Reductive half-reactions were assayed by mixing 60 μm AtBBE-like 15 or 13 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with various substrate concentrations. The observed rate constants at different substrate concentrations (kobs) were determined using the Kinetic Studio software by fitting the data to an exponential function. If suitable, the dissociation constant was determined performing a sigmoidal fit of the observed rate constants employing Origin 7 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton). The oxidative half-reaction was determined by mixing oxygen free photo-reduced 60 μm AtBBE-like 15, AtBBE-like 15 L182V or AtBBE-like 13 with air-saturated buffer. Photoreduction was carried out according to Massey and Hemmerich (28Massey V. Hemmerich P. Photoreduction of flavoproteins and other biological compounds catalyzed by deazaflavins.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Products resulting from the conversion of monolignols and their glycosides were separated and identified using HPLC. Reactions were performed in 1.5-ml reaction vials in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 30 °C and 700 rpm. Substrates were used at a concentration of 2.5 mm and 30 μg/ml AtBBE-like 15. After 24 h, the reaction was quenched by mixing a 500-μl sample with 500 μl of methanol. Samples were spun for 10 min at 9400 × g in a bench-top centrifuge before the clear supernatant was applied to the HPLC. The products were identified by retention time and by comparing their UV absorption spectra with authentic standards. HPLC analyses were done using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with an Atlantis® dC18 5 μm (4.6 × 250 mm) column. Separation of all compounds was achieved using a linear gradient with water with 0.1% TFA as solvent A and acetonitrile with 0.1 TFA as solvent B and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Separations were started with a mobile phase of 80% solvent A and 20% solvent B. The concentration of solvent B was increased to 50% within 20 min followed by a steep ramp to 100% solvent B in 10 min. At the end of the protocol, the concentration of solvent B was again decreased to 20% over 5 min. Retention times of authentic standard compounds were determined using the described protocol. Under these experimental conditions, the following retention times were observed: coniferyl alcohol, 16.06 min; coniferyl aldehyde, 21.39 min; ferulic acid, 18.27 min; coumaryl alcohol, 15.52 min; coumaryl aldehyde, 21.07 min; p-coumaric acid, 17.67 min; sinapyl alcohol, 15.40 min; sinapyl aldehyde, 21.01 min, and sinapic acid, 17.76 min. A glucosyltransferase from apple (UGT71A15, Malus x domestica) was used for the synthesis of 4-O-β-d-glucopyranosides of the monolignols (29Gosch C. Halbwirth H. Schneider B. Hölscher D. Stich K.

Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the glycosyltransferase will be published elsewhere. Briefly, glucosylation of the aglyca (5 mm) from 7.5 mm uridine UDP-glucose was performed in 50 mm Tris/Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm MgCl2, 0.13% BSA, and 10% DMSO in the presence of 6 μm UGT71A15.

https://openalex.org/W619970814,"Genetic maps are important tools in plant genomics and breeding. The present study reports the large-scale discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genetic map construction in tea plant. We developed a total of 6,042 valid SNP markers using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), and subsequently mapped them into the previous framework map. The final map contained 6,448 molecular markers, distributing on fifteen linkage groups corresponding to the number of tea plant chromosomes. The total map length was 3,965 cM, with an average inter-locus distance of 1.0 cM. This map is the first SNP-based reference map of tea plant, as well as the most saturated one developed to date. The SNP markers and map resources generated in this study provide a wealth of genetic information that can serve as a foundation for downstream genetic analyses, such as the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL), map-based cloning, marker-assisted selection, and anchoring of scaffolds to facilitate the process of whole genome sequencing projects for tea plant."
https://openalex.org/W610176537,"The purpose of our research was to investigate the relative frequencies of different types of basketball shots (above head, hook shot, layup, dunk, tip-in), some details about their technical execution (one-legged, two-legged, drive, cut, …), and shot success in different levels of basketball competitions. We analysed video footage and categorized 5024 basketball shots from 40 basketball games and 5 different levels of competitive basketball (National Basketball Association (NBA), Euroleague, Slovenian 1st Division, and two Youth basketball competitions). Statistical analysis with hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models reveals that there are substantial differences between competitions. However, most differences decrease or disappear entirely after we adjust for differences in situations that arise in different competitions (shot location, player type, and attacks in transition). Differences after adjustment are mostly between the Senior and Youth competitions: more shots executed jumping or standing on one leg, more uncategorised shot types, and more dribbling or cutting to the basket in the Youth competitions, which can all be attributed to lesser technical and physical ability of developing basketball players. The two discernible differences within the Senior competitions are that, in the NBA, dunks are more frequent and hook shots are less frequent compared to European basketball, which can be attributed to better athleticism of NBA players. The effect situational variables have on shot types and shot success are found to be very similar for all competitions."
https://openalex.org/W1480292749,"Somatic embryogenesis is a powerful biotechnological tool for the mass production of economically important cultivars. Due to the cellular totipotency of plants, somatic cells under appropriate conditions are able to develop a complete functional embryo. During the induction of somatic embryogenesis, there are different factors involved in the success or failure of the somatic embryogenesis response. Among these factors, the origin of the explant, the culture medium and the in vitro environmental conditions have been the most studied. However, the secretion of molecules into the media has not been fully addressed. We found that the somatic embryogenesis of Coffea canephora, a highly direct embryogenic species, is disrupted by the metabolites secreted from C. arabica, a poorly direct embryogenic species. These metabolites also affect DNA methylation. Our results show that the abundance of two major phenolic compounds, caffeine and chlorogenic acid, are responsible for inhibiting somatic embryogenesis in C. canephora."

Although its contribution in translational regulation of proline repeat-rich proteins has been sufficiently demonstrated, its biological role in higher eukaryotes remains poorly understood. To establish the hypusine modification system as a novel platform for therapeutic strategies, we aimed to investigate its functional relevance in mammals by generating and using a range of new knock-out mouse models for the hypusine-modifying enzymes deoxyhypusine synthase and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase as well as for the cancer-related isoform eIF-5A2. We discovered that homozygous depletion of deoxyhypusine synthase and/or deoxyhypusine hydroxylase causes lethality in adult mice with different penetrance compared with haploinsufficiency. Network-based bioinformatic analysis of proline repeat-rich proteins, which are putative eIF-5A targets, revealed that these proteins are organized in highly connected protein-protein interaction networks. Hypusine-dependent translational control of essential proteins (hubs) and protein complexes inside these networks might explain the lethal phenotype observed after deletion of hypusine-modifying enzymes. Remarkably, our results also demonstrate that the cancer-associated isoform eIF-5A2 is dispensable for normal development and viability. Together, our results provide the first genetic evidence that the hypusine modification in eIF-5A is crucial for homeostasis in mammals.

The sample size was 321 children ranging in age from 10 to 16 years old who were athletes from Extremadura, and 321 parents (included only the father or mother more involved with the sport of his or her child). 175 participants were male and 146 were female from individual (n = 130), and team sports (n=191). A questionnaire was conducted to assess parental perception of support/pressure and another questionnaire was conducted to measure satisfaction of basic psychological needs, type of motivation and enjoyment/boredom showed by their children towards sport practice. Results revealed that parental pressure negatively predicted satisfaction of the basic psychological needs. It also emerged as a strong positive predictor of intrinsic motivation and negative predictor of amotivation. Moreover, intrinsic motivation emerged as positive predictor of enjoyment and a negative predictor of boredom, whereas amotivation positively predicted boredom and negatively predicted enjoyment. Furthermore, results showed there were mean differences by gender: male athletes perceived greater parental pressure. Hence, it is necessary to decrease parental pressure towards their children in sport, with the aim of making them more motivated and enjoy, promoting positive consequences."
https://openalex.org/W637097716,"We herein describe Surusicaris elegans gen. et sp. nov. (in Isoxyidae, amended), a middle (Series 3, Stage 5) Cambrian bivalved arthropod from the new Burgess Shale deposit of Marble Canyon (Kootenay National Park, British Columbia). Surusicaris exhibits 12 simple, partly undivided biramous trunk limbs with long tripartite caeca, which may illustrate a plesiomorphic ""fused"" condition of exopod and endopod. We construe also that the head is made of five somites (= four segments), including two eyes, one pair of anomalocaridid-like frontalmost appendages, and three pairs of poorly sclerotized uniramous limbs. This fossil may therefore be a candidate for illustrating the origin of the plesiomorphic head condition in euarthropods, and questions the significance of the ""two-segmented head"" in, e.g., fuxianhuiids. The frontalmost appendage in isoxyids is intriguingly disparate, bearing similarities with both dinocaridids and euarthropods. In order to evaluate the relative importance of bivalved arthropods, such as Surusicaris, in the hypothetical structuro-functional transition between the dinocaridid frontal appendage and the pre-oral-arguably deutocerebral-appendage of euarthropods, we chose a phenetic approach and computed morphospace occupancy for the frontalmost appendages of 36 stem and crown taxa. Results show different levels of evolutionary decoupling between frontalmost appendage disparity and body plans. Variance is greatest in dinocaridids and ""stem bivalved"" arthropods, but these groups do not occupy the morphospace homogeneously. Rather, the diversity of frontalmost appendages in ""stem bivalved"" arthropods, distinct in its absence of clear clustering, is found to link the morphologies of ""short great appendages,"" chelicerae and antennules. This find fits the hypothesis of an increase in disparity of the deutocerebral appendage prior to its diversification in euarthropods, and possibly corresponds to its original time of development. The analysis of this pattern, however, is sensitive to the-still unclear-extent of polyphyly of the ""stem bivalved"" taxa."
https://openalex.org/W628637993,"Epithelial differentiation is an essential physiological process that imparts mechanical strength and barrier function to squamous epithelia. Perturbation of this process can give rise to numerous human diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, in which antigenic stimuli can penetrate the weakened epithelial barrier to initiate the allergic inflammatory cascade. We recently described a simplified air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system that facilitates the study of differentiated squamous epithelia in vitro. Herein, we use RNA sequencing to define the genome-wide transcriptional changes that occur within the ALI system during epithelial differentiation and in response to allergic inflammation. We identified 2,191 and 781 genes that were significantly altered upon epithelial differentiation or dysregulated in the presence of interleukin 13 (IL-13), respectively. Notably, 286 genes that were modified by IL-13 in the ALI system overlapped with the gene signature present within the inflamed esophageal tissue from patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an allergic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus that is characterized by elevated IL-13 levels, altered epithelial differentiation, and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Pathway analysis of these overlapping genes indicated enrichment in keratin genes; for example, the gene encoding keratin 78, an uncharacterized type II keratin, was upregulated during epithelial differentiation (45-fold) yet downregulated in response to IL-13 and in inflamed esophageal tissue from patients. Thus, our findings delineate an in vitro experimental system that models epithelial differentiation that is dynamically regulated by IL-13. Using this system and analyses of patient tissues, we identify an altered expression profile of novel keratin differentiation markers in response to IL-13 and disease activity, substantiating the potential of this combined approach to identify relevant molecular processes that contribute to human allergic inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W568629826,"To develop allopregnanolone as a therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, we investigated multiple formulations and routes of administration in translationally relevant animal models of both sexes. Subcutaneous, topical (transdermal and intranasal), intramuscular, and intravenous allopregnanolone were bolus-administered. Pharmacokinetic analyses of intravenous allopregnanolone in rabbit and mouse indicated that peak plasma and brain levels (3-fold brain/plasma ratios) at 5min were sufficient to activate neuroregenerative responses at sub-sedative doses. Slow-release subcutaneous suspension of allopregnanolone displayed 5-fold brain/plasma ratio at Cmax at 30min. At therapeutic doses by either subcutaneous or intravenous routes, allopregnanolone mouse plasma levels ranged between 34-51ng/ml by 30min, comparable to published endogenous human level in the third trimester of pregnancy. Exposure to subcutaneous, topical, intramuscular, and intravenous allopregnanolone, at safe and tolerable doses, increased hippocampal markers of neurogenesis including BrdU and PCNA in young 3xTgAD and aged wildtype mice. Intravenous allopregnanolone transiently and robustly phosphorylated CREB within 5min and increased levels of neuronal differentiation transcription factor NeuroD within 4h. Neurogenic efficacy was achieved with allopregnanolone brain exposure of 300-500hr*ng/g. Formulations were tested to determine the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) and maximally tolerated doses (MTD) in male and female rats by sedation behavior time course. Sex differences were apparent, males exhibited ≥40% more sedation time compared to females. Allopregnanolone formulated in sulfobutyl-ether-beta-cyclodextrin at optimized complexation ratio maximized allopregnanolone delivery and neurogenic efficacy. To establish the NOAEL and MTD for Allo-induced sedation using a once-per-week intravenous regenerative treatment regimen: In female rats the NOAEL was 0.5mg/kg and MTD 2mg/kg. The predicted MTD in human female is 0.37mg/kg. In male rats the NOAEL and MTD were less than those determined for female. Outcomes of these PK/PD studies predict a safe and efficacious dose range for initial clinical trials of allopregnanolone for Alzheimer's disease. These findings have translational relevance to multiple neurodegenerative conditions."

Such an analysis could provide new insight on how we, as a culture, perceive human interactions and consume media. The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to define the signature of a novel’s story based on the topological analysis of its social network of characters.

https://openalex.org/W1934404573,"There are conflicting data on the relationship between the time of symptom onset during the 24-hour cycle (circadian dependence) and infarct size in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Moreover, the impact of this circadian pattern of infarct size on clinical outcomes is unknown. We sought to study the circadian dependence of infarct size and its impact on clinical outcomes in STEMI.We studied 6,710 consecutive patients hospitalized for STEMI from 2006 to 2009 in a tropical climate with non-varying day-night cycles. We categorized the time of symptom onset into four 6-hour intervals: midnight-6:00 A.M., 6:00 A.M.-noon, noon-6:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M.-midnight. We used peak creatine kinase as a surrogate marker of infarct size.Midnight-6:00 A.M patients had the highest prevalence of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), more commonly presented with anterior MI (P = 0.03) and received percutaneous coronary intervention less frequently, as compared with other time intervals (P = 0.03). Adjusted mean peak creatine kinase was highest among midnight-6:00 A.M. patients and lowest among 6:00 A.M.-noon patients (2,590.8±2,839.1 IU/L and 2,336.3±2,386.6 IU/L, respectively, P = 0.04). Midnight-6:00 A.M patients were at greatest risk of acute heart failure (P<0.001), 30-day mortality (P = 0.03) and 1-year mortality (P = 0.03), while the converse was observed in 6:00 A.M.-noon patients. After adjusting for diabetes, infarct location and performance of percutaneous coronary intervention, circadian variations in acute heart failure incidence remained strongly significant (P = 0.001).We observed a circadian peak and nadir in infarct size during STEMI onset from midnight-6:00A.M and 6:00A.M.-noon respectively. The peak and nadir incidence of acute heart failure paralleled this circadian pattern. Differences in diabetes prevalence, infarct location and mechanical reperfusion may account partly for the observed circadian pattern of infarct size and acute heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1539841810,"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is a very effective bariatric procedure to achieve significant and sustained weight loss, yet little is known about the procedure's impact on the brain. This study examined the effects of RYGB on the brain's response to the anticipation of highly palatable versus regular food.High fat diet-induced obese rats underwent RYGB or sham operation and were then tested for conditioned place preference (CPP) for the bacon-paired chamber, relative to the chow-paired chamber. After CPP, animals were placed in either chamber without the food stimulus, and brain-glucose metabolism (BGluM) was measured using positron emission tomography (μPET).Bacon CPP was only observed in RYGB rats that had stable weight loss following surgery. BGluM assessment revealed that RYGB selectively activated regions of the right and midline cerebellum (Lob 8) involved in subjective processes related to reward or expectation. Also, bacon anticipation led to significant activation in the medial parabrachial nuclei (important in gustatory processing) and dorsomedial tegmental area (key to reward, motivation, cognition and addiction) in RYGB rats; and activation in the retrosplenial cortex (default mode network), and the primary visual cortex in control rats.RYGB alters brain activity in areas involved in reward expectation and sensory (taste) processing when anticipating a palatable fatty food. Thus, RYGB may lead to changes in brain activity in regions that process reward and taste-related behaviors. Specific cerebellar regions with altered metabolism following RYGB may help identify novel therapeutic targets for treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W640119782,"The discrete data structure and large sequencing depth of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments can often generate outlier read counts in one or more RNA samples within a homogeneous group. Thus, how to identify and manage outlier observations in RNA-seq data is an emerging topic of interest. One of the main objectives in these research efforts is to develop statistical methodology that effectively balances the impact of outlier observations and achieves maximal power for statistical testing. To reach that goal, strengthening the accuracy of outlier detection is an important precursor. Current outlier detection algorithms for RNA-seq data are executed within a testing framework and may be sensitive to sparse data and heavy-tailed distributions. Therefore, we propose a univariate algorithm that utilizes a probabilistic approach to measure the deviation between an observation and the distribution generating the remaining data and implement it within in an iterative leave-one-out design strategy. Analyses of real and simulated RNA-seq data show that the proposed methodology has higher outlier detection rates for both non-normalized and normalized negative binomial distributed data."
https://openalex.org/W1499556329,"Physical dormancy, a structural feature of the seed coat known as hard seededness, is an important characteristic for adaptation of plants against unstable and unpredictable environments. To dissect the molecular basis of qHS1, a quantitative trait locus for hard seededness in soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.), we developed a near-isogenic line (NIL) of a permeable (soft-seeded) cultivar, Tachinagaha, containing a hard-seed allele from wild soybean (G. soja) introduced by successive backcrossings. The hard-seed allele made the seed coat of Tachinagaha more rigid by increasing the amount of β-1,4-glucans in the outer layer of palisade cells of the seed coat on the dorsal side of seeds, known to be a point of entrance of water. Fine-mapping and subsequent expression and sequencing analyses revealed that qHS1 encodes an endo-1,4-β-glucanase. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) introduced an amino acid substitution in a substrate-binding cleft of the enzyme, possibly reducing or eliminating its affinity for substrates in permeable cultivars. Introduction of the genomic region of qHS1 from the impermeable (hard-seeded) NIL into the permeable cultivar Kariyutaka resulted in accumulation of β-1,4-glucan in the outer layer of palisade cells and production of hard seeds. The SNP allele found in the NIL was further associated with the occurrence of hard seeds in soybean cultivars of various origins.

It directly interacts through its TPR domain with glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Delineation of how FLU binds to GluTR is important for understanding the molecular basis for FLU-mediated repression of synthesis of ALA, the universal tetrapyrrole precursor. Here, we characterize the FLU-GluTR interaction by solving the crystal structures of the uncomplexed TPR domain of FLU (FLU(TPR)) at 1.45-A resolution and the complex of the dimeric domain of GluTR bound to FLU(TPR) at 2.4-A resolution. Three non-canonical TPR motifs of each FLU(TPR) form a concave surface and clamp the helix bundle in the C-terminal dimeric domain of GluTR. We demonstrate that a 2:2 FLU(TPR)-GluTR complex is the functional unit for FLU-mediated GluTR regulation and suggest that the formation of the FLU-GluTR complex prevents glutamyl-tRNA, the GluTR substrate, from binding with this enzyme. These results also provide insights into the spatial regulation of ALA synthesis by the membrane-located FLU protein."
https://openalex.org/W1607292526,"Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. There is some evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in weight loss. However, this psychological concept has only been rarely explored in observational studies, and no study to date has examined the association between dispositional mindfulness and weight status in a large population-based sample.We aimed to examine the relationship between mindfulness scores and weight status in a large sample of the adult general population in France.A total of 14,400 men and 49,228 women aged ≥18 y participating in the NutriNet-Santé study were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We collected mindfulness data using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire as well as self-reported weight and height. The association between weight status and dispositional mindfulness, as well as its subscales (observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reactivity), was assessed using multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors.Women with higher dispositional mindfulness scores were less likely to be overweight (excluding obesity) (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90) and obese (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.65-0.78). In addition, overall, in this group, all subscales were inversely associated with weight status, with the strongest association found for the ""observing"" subscale. In men, higher mindfulness was associated only with lower odds of obesity (OR quartile 4 vs. 1 = 0.81 (0.69, 0.96)), and only the ""observing"" and ""non-reactivity"" subscales were significantly inversely associated with weight status.Results support the interest of a shift in perspective that takes into account positive psychological and cognitive factors such as dispositional mindfulness in the investigation of obesity and its associated factors."
https://openalex.org/W607712375,"Accurate muscle activity onset detection is an essential prerequisite for many applications of surface electromyogram (EMG). This study presents an unsupervised EMG learning framework based on a sequential Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to detect muscle activity onsets. The distribution of the logarithmic power of EMG signal was characterized by a two-component GMM in each frequency band, in which the two components respectively correspond to the posterior distribution of EMG burst and non-burst logarithmic powers. The parameter set of the GMM was sequentially estimated based on maximum likelihood, subject to constraints derived from the relationship between EMG burst and non-burst distributions. An optimal threshold for EMG burst/non-burst classification was determined using the GMM at each frequency band, and the final decision was obtained by a voting procedure. The proposed novel framework was applied to simulated and experimental surface EMG signals for muscle activity onset detection. Compared with conventional approaches, it demonstrated robust performance for low and changing signal to noise ratios in a dynamic environment. The framework is applicable for real-time implementation, and does not require the assumption of non EMG burst in the initial stage. Such features facilitate its practical application."
https://openalex.org/W576141130,"Cx3cr1, the receptor for the chemokine Cx3cl1 (fractalkine), has been implicated in the progression and severity of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A complicating factor is that Cx3cr1 has been demonstrated in both neurons and microglia. Here, we have dissected the differences between neuronal and microglial Cx3cr1, specifically by comparing direct amyloid-β-induced toxicity in cultured, mature, microglia-depleted hippocampal neurons from wild-type and Cx3cr1-/- mice. Wild-type neurons expressed both Cx3cl1 and Cx3cr1 and released Cx3cl1 in response to amyloid-β. Knockout of neuronal Cx3cr1 abated amyloid-β-induced lactate dehydrogenase release. Furthermore, amyloid-β differentially induced depression of pre- and postsynaptic components of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, in a peptide conformation-dependent manner. Knockout of neuronal Cx3cr1 abated effects of both amyloid-β conformational states, which were differentiable by aggregation kinetics and peptide morphology. We obtained similar results after both acute and chronic treatment of cultured neurons with the Cx3cr1 antagonist F1. Thus, neuronal Cx3cr1 may impact Alzheimer's disease-like pathology by modulating conformational state-dependent amyloid-β-induced synaptotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W658084492,"Many of previous neuroimaging studies on neuronal structures in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) used univariate statistical tests on unimodal imaging measurements. Although the univariate methods revealed important aberrance of local morphometry in OCD patients, the covariance structure of the anatomical alterations remains unclear. Motivated by recent developments of multivariate techniques in the neuroimaging field, we applied a fusion method called ""mCCA+jICA"" on multimodal structural data of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 30 unmedicated patients with OCD and 34 healthy controls. Amongst six highly correlated multimodal networks (p < 0.0001), we found significant alterations of the interrelated gray and white matter networks over occipital and parietal cortices, frontal interhemispheric connections and cerebella (False Discovery Rate q ≤ 0.05). In addition, we found white matter networks around basal ganglia that correlated with a subdimension of OC symptoms, namely 'harm/checking' (q ≤ 0.05). The present study not only agrees with the previous unimodal findings of OCD, but also quantifies the association of the altered networks across imaging modalities."
https://openalex.org/W579659199,"C1A plant cysteine proteases are synthesized as pre-pro-enzymes that need to be processed to become active by the pro-peptide claves off from its cognate enzyme. These pro-sequences play multifunctional roles including the capacity to specifically inhibit their own as well as other C1A protease activities from diverse origin. In this study, it is analysed the potential role of C1A pro-regions from barley as regulators of cysteine proteases in target phytophagous arthropods (coleopteran and acari). The in vitro inhibitory action of these pro-sequences, purified as recombinant proteins, is demonstrated. Moreover, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing different fragments of HvPap-1 barley gene containing the pro-peptide sequence were generated and the acaricide function was confirmed by bioassays conducted with the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Feeding trials resulted in a significant reduction of leaf damage in the transgenic lines expressing the pro-peptide in comparison to non-transformed control and strongly correlated with an increase in mite mortality. Additionally, the analysis of the expression levels of a selection of potential mite targets (proteases and protease inhibitors) revealed a mite strategy to counteract the inhibitory activity produced by the C1A barley pro-prodomain. These findings demonstrate that pro-peptides can control mite pests and could be applied as defence proteins in biotechnological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1492655092,"Background Various studies have modeled the impact of test-and-treat policies on the HIV epidemics worldwide. However, few modeling studies have taken into account China’s context. To understand the potential effect of test-and-treat on the HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China, we developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of the strategy. Method Based on the natural history of the CD4 count of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA), we constructed a dynamic compartmental model of HIV transmission among Chinese MSM to project the number of HIV new infections and prevalence over 10 years. We predicted the annual number of HIV new infections and the total number of MSM living with HIV and AIDS (based on Beijing data) between 2010 and 2022 under the following conditions: (1) current practice (testing rate of 50% and ART coverage of 39%); (2) both testing rate and ART coverage increasing to 70% in 2013; (3) both testing rate and ART coverage increasing to 90% in 2013; and (4) both testing rate and ART coverage increasing gradually every year until 90% since 2013. Results Based on our model, if the HIV test-and-treat policy was implemented among Chinese MSM, the total number of HIV new infections over 10 years (2013-2022) would be reduced by 50.6-70.9% compared with the current policy. When ART coverage for PLWHA increased to 58% since 2013, the ‘turning point’ would occur on the curve of HIV new infections by 2015. A 25% reduction in annual number of HIV new infections by 2015 might be achieved if the testing rate increased from 50% to 70% and treatment coverage for PLWHA increased to 55% since 2013. Conclusion Implementation of the test-and-treat strategy may significantly reduce HIV new infections among MSM in China. Great efforts need to be made to scale up HIV testing rate and ART coverage among Chinese MSM."
https://openalex.org/W1545542040,"Background Prostate cancer initially develops in an androgen-dependent manner but, during its progression, transitions to being androgen-independent in the advanced stage. Pin1, one of the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases, is reportedly overexpressed in prostate cancers and is considered to contribute to accelerated cell growth, which may be one of the major factors contributing to their androgen-independent growth. Thus, we investigated how Pin1 modulates the gene expressions in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines using microarray analysis. In addition, the effects of Juglone, a commercially available Pin1 inhibitor were also examined. Methods Two prostate cancer cell-lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent), were treated with Pin1 siRNA and its effects on gene expressions were analyzed by microarray. Individual gene regulations induced by Pin1 siRNA or the Pin1 inhibitor Juglone were examined using RT-PCR. In addition, the effects of Juglone on the growth of LNCaP and DU145 transplanted into mice were investigated. Results Microarray analysis revealed that transcriptional factors regulated by Pin1 differed markedly between LNCaP and DU145 cells, the only exception being that Nrf was regulated in the same way by Pin1 siRNA in both cell lines. Despite this marked difference in gene regulations, Pin1 siRNA and Juglone exert a strong inhibitory effect on both the LNCaP and the DU145 cell line, suppressing in vitro cell proliferation as well as tumor enlargement when transplanted into mice. Conclusions Despite Pin1-regulated gene expressions differing between these two prostate cancer cell-lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent), Pin1 inhibition suppresses proliferation of both cell-lines. These findings suggest the potential effectiveness of Pin1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents for prostate cancers, regardless of their androgen sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1517881884,"The development of cancer involves genetic predisposition and a variety of environmental exposures. Genome-wide linkage analyses provide evidence for the significant linkage of many diseases to susceptibility loci on chromosome 8p23, the location of the human defensin gene cluster. Human β-defensins (hBDs) are important molecules of innate immunity. This study was designed to analyze the expression and genetic variations in hBDs (hBD-1, hBD-2, hBD-3 and hBD-4) and their putative association with colon cancer. hBD gene expression and relative protein expression were evaluated by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively, from 40 normal patients and 40 age-matched patients with colon cancer in Saudi Arabia. In addition, hBD polymorphisms were genotyped by exon sequencing and by promoter methylation. hBD-1, hBD-2, hBD-3 and hBD-4 basal messenger RNA expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. Several insertion mutations were detected in different exons of the analyzed hBDs. However, no methylation in any hBDs promoters was detected because of the limited number of CpG islands in these regions. We demonstrated for the first time a link between hBD expression and colon cancer. This suggests that there is a significant link between innate immunity deregulation through disruption of cationic peptides (hBDs) and the potential development of colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1842522565,"Bone marrow is a reservoir for regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, but how T(reg) cells are regulated in that environment remains poorly understood. We show that expression of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) in bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) increases the production of T(reg) cells via a mechanism involving the up-regulation of developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), an endogenous leukocyte-endothelial adhesion inhibitor. We found that the expression of Del-1 is increased ∼4-fold in the bone tissues of GILZ transgenic (Tg) mice, and this increase is coupled with a significant increase in the production of IL-10 (2.80 vs. 0.83) and decrease in the production of IL-6 (0.80 vs. 2.33) and IL-12 (0.25 vs. 1.67). We also show that GILZ-expressing BMSCs present antigen in a way that favors T(reg) cells. These results indicate that GILZ plays a critical role mediating the crosstalk between BMSCs and T(reg) in the bone marrow microenvironment. These data, together with our previous findings that overexpression of GILZ in BMSCs antagonizes TNF-α-elicited inflammatory responses, suggest that GILZ plays important roles in bone-immune cell communication and BMSC immune suppressive functions."
https://openalex.org/W565029625,"Scedosporium boydii is a pathogenic filamentous fungus that causes a wide range of human infections, notably respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. The development of new therapeutic strategies targeting S. boydii necessitates a better understanding of the physiology of this fungus and the identification of new molecular targets. In this work, we studied the conidium-to-germ tube transition using a variety of techniques including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, two-phase partitioning, microelectrophoresis and cationized ferritin labeling, chemical force spectroscopy, lectin labeling, and nanoLC-MS/MS for cell wall GPI-anchored protein analysis. We demonstrated that the cell wall undergoes structural changes with germination accompanied with a lower hydrophobicity, electrostatic charge and binding capacity to cationized ferritin. Changes during germination also included a higher accessibility of some cell wall polysaccharides to lectins and less CH3/CH3 interactions (hydrophobic adhesion forces mainly due to glycoproteins). We also extracted and identified 20 GPI-anchored proteins from the cell wall of S. boydii, among which one was detected only in the conidial wall extract and 12 only in the mycelial wall extract. The identified sequences belonged to protein families involved in virulence in other fungi like Gelp/Gasp, Crhp, Bglp/Bgtp families and a superoxide dismutase. These results highlighted the cell wall remodeling during germination in S. boydii with the identification of a substantial number of cell wall GPI-anchored conidial or hyphal specific proteins, which provides a basis to investigate the role of these molecules in the host-pathogen interaction and fungal virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1531543028,"Bacterial polyester polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been produced in engineered Escherichia coli, which turned into an efficient and versatile platform by applying metabolic and enzyme engineering approaches. The present study aimed at drawing out the latent potential of this organism using genome-wide mutagenesis. To meet this goal, a transposon-based mutagenesis was carried out on E. coli, which was transformed to produce poly(lactate-co-3-hydroxybutyrate) from glucose. A high-throughput screening of polymer-accumulating cells on Nile red-containing plates isolated one mutant that produced 1.8-fold higher quantity of polymer without severe disadvantages in the cell growth and monomer composition of the polymer. The transposon was inserted into the locus within the gene encoding MtgA that takes part, as a non-lethal component, in the formation of the peptidoglycan backbone. Accordingly, the mtgA-deleted strain E. coli JW3175, which was a derivate of superior PHA-producing strain BW25113, was examined for polymer production, and exhibited an enhanced accumulation of the polymer (7.0 g/l) compared to the control (5.2 g/l). Interestingly, an enlargement in cell width associated with polymer accumulation was observed in this strain, resulting in a 1.6-fold greater polymer accumulation per cell compared to the control. This result suggests that the increase in volumetric capacity for accumulating intracellular material contributed to the enhanced polymer production. The mtgA deletion should be combined with conventional engineering approaches, and thus, is a promising strategy for improved production of intracellularly accumulated biopolymers."
https://openalex.org/W643933207,"Fungal infections of the cornea can be sight-threatening and have a worse prognosis than other types of microbial corneal infections. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRP), which are expressed on the ocular surface, play an important role in the immune response against bacterial corneal infections by activating toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing phagocytosis. However, the role of PGLYRPs in innate immune response to fungal pathogens has not been investigated. In this study, we observed a significant induction of three PGLYRPs 2–4 in primary human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) exposed to live or heat-killed Candida albicans (HKCA). The C-type lectin receptor dectin-1 plays a critical role in controlling Candida albicans infections by promoting phagocytic activity and cytokine production in macrophages and dendritic cells. Here, we demonstrate that dectin-1 is expressed by normal human corneal tissue and primary HCECs. HKCA exposure increased expression of dectin-1 on HCECs at mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, dectin-1 neutralizing antibody, IκB-α inhibitor BAY11-7082, and NF-κB activation inhibitor quinazoline blocked NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation, as well as the induction of the PGLYRPs by HKCA in HCECs. Furthermore, rhPGLYRP-2 was found to suppress colony-forming units of Candida albicans in vitro. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that dectin-1 is expressed by human corneal epithelial cells, and dectin-1/NF-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating Candida albicans/HKCA-induced PGLYRP secretion by HCECs."

We wished to generate a trackable HA-based VLP that would allow us to study both particle assembly in plants and VLP interactions within the mammalian immune system. To this end, a fusion protein was designed, composed of H5 (from influenza A/Indonesia/05/2005 [H5N1]) with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Expression of H5-eGFP in N. benthamiana produced brightly fluorescent ∼160 nm particles resembling H5-VLPs. H5-eGFP-VLPs elicited anti-H5 serologic responses in mice comparable to those elicited by H5-VLPs in almost all assays tested (hemagglutination inhibition/IgG(total)/IgG1/IgG2b/IgG2a:IgG1 ratio), as well as a superior anti-GFP IgG response (mean optical density = 2.52 ± 0.16 sem) to that elicited by soluble GFP (mean optical density = 0.12 ± 0.06 sem). Confocal imaging of N. benthamiana cells expressing H5-eGFP displayed large fluorescent accumulations at the cell periphery, and draining lymph nodes from mice given H5-eGFP-VLPs via footpad injection demonstrated bright fluorescence shortly after administration (10 min), providing proof of concept that the H5-eGFP-protein/VLPs could be used to monitor both VLP assembly and immune trafficking. Given these findings, this novel fluorescent reagent will be a powerful tool to gain further fundamental insight into the biology of influenza VLP vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W563863674,"Multiple biological processes can generate sexual selection on male visual signals such as color. For example, females may prefer colorful males because those males are more readily detected (perceptual bias), or because male color conveys information about male quality and associated direct or indirect benefits to females. For example, male threespine stickleback often exhibit red throat coloration, which females prefer both because red is more visible in certain environments, and red color is correlated with male immune function and parasite load. However, not all light environments favor red nuptial coloration: more tannin-stained water tends to favor the evolution of a melanic male phenotype. Do such population differences in stickleback male color, driven by divergent light environments, lead to changes in the relationship between color and immunity? Here, we show that, within stickleback populations, multiple components of male color (brightness and hue of four body parts) are correlated with multiple immune variables (ROS production, phagocytosis rates, and lymphocyte:leukocyte ratios). Some of these color-immune associations persist across stickleback populations with very different male color patterns, whereas other color-immune associations are population-specific. Overall, lakes with red males exhibit stronger color-immune covariance while melanic male populations exhibit weak if any color-immune associations. Our finding that color-immunity relationships are labile implies that any evolution of male color traits (e.g., due to female perceptual bias in a given light environment), can alter the utility of color as an indicator of male quality."
https://openalex.org/W597176126,"Despite the option of multimodal therapy in the treatment strategies of osteosarcoma (OS), the most common primary malignant bone tumor, the standard therapy has not changed over the last decades and still involves multidrug chemotherapy and radical surgery. Although successfully applied in many patients a large number of patients eventually develop recurrent or metastatic disease in which current therapeutic regimens often lack efficacy. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In this study, we performed a phenotypic high-throughput screening campaign using a 25,000 small-molecule diversity library to identify new small molecules selectively targeting osteosarcoma cells. We could identify two new small molecules that specifically reduced cell viability in OS cell lines U2OS and HOS, but affected neither hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) nor primary human osteoblasts (hOB). In addition, the two compounds induced caspase 3 and 7 activity in the U2OS cell line. Compared to conventional drugs generally used in OS treatment such as doxorubicin, we indeed observed a greater sensitivity of OS cell viability to the newly identified compounds compared to doxorubicin and staurosporine. The p53-negative OS cell line Saos-2 almost completely lacked sensitivity to compound treatment that could indicate a role of p53 in the drug response. Taken together, our data show potential implications for designing more efficient therapies in OS."

In order to discover new photoactive drugs or characterize phototoxic pollutants, it would be advantageous to use simple biological tests of phototoxicy. In this work, we present a pilot screening of 37 dyes to test for phototoxic effects in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Populations of this nematode were treated with different dyes, and subsequently exposed to 30 min of white light. Behavioral outcomes were quantified by recording the global motility using an infrared tracking device (WMicrotracker). Of the tested compounds, 17 dyes were classified as photoactive, being phloxine B, primuline, eosin Y, acridine orange and rose Bengal the most phototoxic. To assess photoactivity after uptake, compounds were retested after washing them out of the medium before light irradiation. Dye uptake into the worms was also analyzed by staining or fluorescence. All the positive drugs were incorporated by animals and produced phototoxic effects after washing. We also tested the stress response being triggered by the treatments through reporter strains. Endoplasmic reticulum stress response (hsp-4::GFP strain) was activated by 22% of phototoxic dyes, and mitochondrial stress response (hsp-6::GFP strain) was induced by 16% of phototoxic dyes. These results point to a phototoxic perturbation of the protein functionality and an oxidative stress similar to that reported in cell cultures. Our work shows for the first time the feasibility of C. elegans for running phototoxic screenings and underscores its application on photoactive drugs and environmental pollutants assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2012414268,"Background Clinical genetic testing is becoming an integral part of medical care for inherited disorders. While genetic testing and counseling are readily available in high-income countries, in low- and middle-income countries like Kenya genetic testing is limited and genetic counseling is virtually non-existent. Genetic testing is likely to become widespread in Kenya within the next decade, yet there has not been a concomitant increase in genetic counseling resources. To address this gap, we designed an interactive workshop for clinicians in Kenya focused on the genetics of the childhood eye cancer retinoblastoma. The objectives were to increase retinoblastoma genetics knowledge, build genetic counseling skills and increase confidence in those skills. Methods The workshop was conducted at the 2013 Kenyan National Retinoblastoma Strategy meeting. It included a retinoblastoma genetics presentation, small group discussion of case studies and genetic counseling role-play. Knowledge was assessed by standardized test, and genetic counseling skills and confidence by questionnaire. Results Knowledge increased significantly post-workshop, driven by increased knowledge of retinoblastoma causative genetics. One-year post-workshop, participant knowledge had returned to baseline, indicating that knowledge retention requires more frequent reinforcement. Participants reported feeling more confident discussing genetics with patients, and had integrated more genetic counseling into patient interactions. Conclusion A comprehensive retinoblastoma genetics workshop can increase the knowledge and skills necessary for effective retinoblastoma genetic counseling."
https://openalex.org/W1561933026,"The Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) plays a role in maintaining genomic stability. The lack of WRN results in Werner syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which causes premature aging accompanied by many complications such as rare forms of cancer and type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms of these complications, arising due to the loss of WRN, are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated the function of WRN in transcriptional regulation of NF-κB targets. WRN physically interacts via its RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain with the Rel homology domain of both the RelA (p65) and the p50 subunits of NF-κB. In the steady state, WRN is recruited to HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), a typical NF-κB-responsive promoter, as well as the p50/p50 homodimer, in an NF-κB site-dependent manner. The amount of WRN on LTR increased along with the transactivating RelA/p50 heterodimer in response to TNF-α stimulation. Further, a knockdown of WRN reduced the transactivation of LTR in exogenous RelA/p50-introduced or TNF-α-stimulated cells. Additionally, knockdown of WRN reduced TNF-α stimulation-induced activation of the endogenous promoter of IL-8, an NF-κB-responsive gene, and WRN increased its association with the IL-8 promoter region together with RelA/p50 after TNF-α stimulation. In conjunction with studies that have shown NF-κB to be a key regulator of aging and inflammation, our results indicate a novel role of WRN in transcriptional regulation.

Compared to conventional LNA/DNA gapmers, the melting temperatures of the duplexes formed by modified LNA/DNA gapmers and DNA or RNA targets were reduced by approximately 1.6-3.3°C per modification. Comparative transfection studies showed that small interfering RNA was the most potent HCV RNA replication inhibitor (effective concentration 50 (EC50): 0.13 nM), whereas isosequential standard and modified LNA/DNA gapmers were approximately 50-fold less efficient (EC50: 5.5 and 7.1 nM, respectively). However, the presence of 8-oxo-dG residues led to a more complete suppression of HCV replication in transfected cells. These modifications did not affect the efficiency of RNase H cleavage of antisense oligonucleotide:RNA duplexes but did alter specificity, triggering the appearance of multiple cleavage products. Moreover, the incorporation of 8-oxo-dG residues increased the stability of antisense oligonucleotides of different configurations in human serum."
https://openalex.org/W577093128,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is associated with high mortality due to infiltrative growth and recurrence. Median survival of the patients is less than 15 months, increasing requirements for new therapies. We found that both arsenic trioxide and 10058F4, an inhibitor of Myc, induced differentiation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) of GBM and that arsenic trioxide drastically enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of 10058F4 but not apoptotic effects. EGFR-driven genetically engineered GBM mouse model showed that this cooperative effect is higher in EGFRvIII-expressing INK4a/Arf-/- neural stem cells (NSCs) than in control wild type NSCs. In addition, treatment of GBM CSC xenografts with arsenic trioxide and 10058F4 resulted in significant decrease in tumor growth and increased differentiation with concomitant decrease of proneural and mesenchymal GBM CSCs in vivo. Our study was the first to evaluate arsenic trioxide and 10058F4 interaction in GBM CSC differentiation and to assess new opportunities for arsenic trioxide and 10058F4 combination as a promising approach for future differentiation therapy of GBM."
https://openalex.org/W857447834,"The impacts of climate change on forest community composition are still not well known. Although directional trends in climate change and community composition change were reported in recent years, further quantitative analyses are urgently needed. Previous studies focused on measuring population growth rates in a single time period, neglecting the development of the populations. Here we aimed to compose a method for calculating the community composition change, and to testify the impacts of climate change on community composition change within a relatively short period (several decades) based on long-term monitoring data from two plots-Dinghushan Biosphere Reserve, China (DBR) and Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI)-that are located in tropical and subtropical regions. We proposed a relatively more concise index, Slnλ, which refers to an overall population growth rate based on the dominant species in a community. The results indicated that the population growth rate of a majority of populations has decreased over the past few decades. This decrease was mainly caused by population development. The increasing temperature had a positive effect on population growth rates and community change rates. Our results promote understanding and explaining variations in population growth rates and community composition rates, and are helpful to predict population dynamics and population responses to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W972017059,"Invasive pneumococcal disease causes substantial morbidity and mortality in Africa. Evaluating population level indirect impact on adult disease of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programmes in infants requires baseline population incidence rates but these are often lacking in areas with limited disease surveillance. We used hospital based blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid surveillance to calculate minimal incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the adult (≥15 years old) population of Blantyre, a rapidly growing urban centre in southern Malawi, in the period preceding vaccine introduction. Invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in Blantyre district was high, mean 58.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 53.7, 62.7) per 100,000 person years and peaking among 35 to 40 year olds at 108.8 (95%CI: 89.0, 131.7) mirroring the population age prevalence of HIV infection. For pneumococcal bacteraemia in urban Blantyre, mean incidence was 60.6 (95% CI: 55.2, 66.5) per 100,000 person years, peaking among 35 to 40 year olds at 114.8 (95%CI: 90.3, 143.9). We suspected that our surveillance may under-ascertain the true burden of disease, so we used location data from bacteraemic subjects and projected population estimates to calculate local sub-district incidence, then examined the impact of community level socio-demographic covariates as possible predictors of local sub-district incidence of pneumococcal and non-pneumococcal pathogenic bacteraemia. Geographic heterogeneity in incidence was marked with localised hotspots but ward level covariates apart from prison were not associated with pneumococcal bacteraemia incidence. Modelling suggests that the current sentinel surveillance system under-ascertains the true burden of disease. We outline a number of challenges to surveillance for pneumococcal disease in our low-resource setting. Subsequent surveillance in the vaccine era will have to account for geographic heterogeneity when evaluating population level indirect impact of PCV13 introduction to the childhood immunisation program."
https://openalex.org/W612224009,"Health care resource allocation is key towards attaining equity in the health system. However, health professionals' perceived impact and attitude towards health care resource allocation in Sub-Saharan Africa is unknown; furthermore, they occupy a position which makes them notice the impact of different policies in their health system. This study explored perceptions and attitudes of health professionals in Kenya on health care resource allocation mechanism.We conducted a survey of a representative sample of 341 health professionals in Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital from February to April 2012, consisting of over 3000 employees. We assessed health professionals' perceived impact and attitudes on health care resource allocation mechanism in Kenya. We used structural equation modeling and applied a Confirmatory Factor Analysis using Robust Maximum Likelihood estimation procedure to test the hypothesized model.We found that the allocation mechanism was negatively associated with their perceived positive impact (-1.04, p < .001), health professionals' satisfaction (-0.24, p < .01), and professionals' attitudes (-1.55, p < .001) while it was positively associated with perceived negative impact (1.14, p < .001). Perceived positive impact of the allocation mechanism was negatively associated with their overall satisfaction (-0.08) and attitude (-0.98) at p < .001, respectively. Furthermore, overall satisfaction was negatively associated with attitude (-1.10, p <.001). On the other hand, perceived negative impact of the allocation was positively associated with overall satisfaction (0.29, p <.001) but was not associated with attitude.The result suggests that health care resource allocation mechanism has a negative effect towards perceptions, attitudes and overall satisfaction of health professionals who are at the frontline in health care. These findings can serve as a crucial reference for policymakers as the Kenyan health system move towards devolving the system of governance."
https://openalex.org/W240126264,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes mellitus that affects more than one-quarter of the population with diabetes, and can lead to blindness if not discovered in time. An automated screening enables the identification of patients who need further medical attention. This study aimed to classify retinal images of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples utilizing an automated computer-based multi-lesion eye screening program for diabetic retinopathy. The multi-lesion classifier was trained on 1,014 images from the São Paulo Eye Hospital and tested on retinal images containing no DR-related lesion, single lesions, or multiple types of lesions from the Inala Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care centre. The automated multi-lesion classifier has the potential to enhance the efficiency of clinical practice delivering diabetic retinopathy screening. Our program does not necessitate image samples for training from any specific ethnic group or population being assessed and is independent of image pre- or post-processing to identify retinal lesions. In this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, the program achieved 100% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity in identifying bright lesions, while detection of red lesions achieved a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 95%. When both bright and red lesions were present, 100% sensitivity with 88.9% specificity was obtained. All results obtained with this automated screening program meet WHO standards for diabetic retinopathy screening."
https://openalex.org/W1556467507,"The long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered to be of major health importance, and recent studies indicate that their endogenous metabolism is influenced by B-vitamin status and smoking habits. We investigated the associations of circulating B-vitamins and smoking habits with serum polyunsaturated fatty acids among 1,366 patients who underwent coronary angiography due to suspected coronary heart disease at Haukeland University Hospital, Norway. Of these, 52% provided information on dietary habits by a food frequency questionnaire. Associations were assessed using partial correlation (Spearman's rho). In the total population, the concentrations of most circulating B-vitamins were positively associated with serum n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but negatively with serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the associations between B-vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids tended to be weaker in smokers. This could not be solely explained by differences in dietary intake. Furthermore, plasma cotinine, a marker of recent nicotine exposure, showed a negative relationship with serum n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but a positive relationship with serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In conclusion, circulating B-vitamins are, in contrast to plasma cotinine, generally positively associated with serum n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and negatively with serum n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in patients with suspected coronary heart disease. Further studies should investigate whether B-vitamin status and smoking habits may modify the clinical effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid intake."
https://openalex.org/W590480505,"The possibility of replacing the originally discovered and widely used DNA reprogramming transcription factors is stimulating enormous effort to identify more effective compounds that would not alter the genetic information. Here, we describe the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSc) from head-derived primary culture of mouse embryonic cells using small chemical inhibitors of the MEK and TGF-beta pathways without delivery of exogenous transcription factors. These iPSc express standard pluripotency markers and retain their potential to differentiate into cells of all germ layers. Our data indicate that head-derived embryonic neural cells might have the reprogramming potential while neither the same primary cells cultivated over five passages in vitro nor a cell population derived from adult brain possesses this capacity. Our results reveal the potential for small molecules to functionally replace routinely used transcription factors and lift the veil on molecular regulation controlling pluripotency. The conditions described here could provide a platform upon which other genome non integrative and safer reprogramming processes could be developed. This work also shows novel potential for developing embryonic neural cells."
https://openalex.org/W620516222,"Type I restriction-modification enzymes are multifunctional heteromeric complexes with DNA cleavage and ATP-dependent DNA translocation activities located on motor subunit HsdR. Functional coupling of DNA cleavage and translocation is a hallmark of the Type I restriction systems that is consistent with their proposed role in horizontal gene transfer. DNA cleavage occurs at nonspecific sites distant from the cognate recognition sequence, apparently triggered by stalled translocation. The X-ray crystal structure of the complete HsdR subunit from E. coli plasmid R124 suggested that the triggering mechanism involves interdomain contacts mediated by ATP. In the present work, in vivo and in vitro activity assays and crystal structures of three mutants of EcoR124I HsdR designed to probe this mechanism are reported. The results indicate that interdomain engagement via ATP is indeed responsible for signal transmission between the endonuclease and helicase domains of the motor subunit. A previously identified sequence motif that is shared by the RecB nucleases and some Type I endonucleases is implicated in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1581790355,"Extramedullary hematopoiesis has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including cardiovascular diseases. In this process, the spleen is seeded with mobilized bone marrow cells that augment its hematopoietic ability. It is unclear whether these immigrant cells that are produced/reprogrammed in spleen are similar or different from those found in the bone marrow. To begin to understand this, we investigated the relative potency of adult splenocytes per se to repopulate bone marrow of lethally-irradiated mice and its functional consequences in atherosclerosis. The splenocytes were harvested from GFP donor mice and transplanted into myeloablated wild type recipient mice without the inclusion of any bone marrow helper cells. We found that adult splenocytes repopulated bone marrow of myeloablated mice and the transplanted cells differentiated into a full repertoire of myeloid cell lineages. The level of monocytes/macrophages in the bone marrow of recipient mice was dependent on the cell origin, i.e., the donor splenocytes gave rise to significantly more monocytes/macrophages than the donor bone marrow cells. This occurred despite a significantly lower number of hematopoietic stem cells being present in the donor splenocytes when compared with donor bone marrow cells. Atherosclerosis studies revealed that donor splenocytes displayed a similar level of atherogenic and atheroprotective activities to those of donor bone marrow cells. Cell culture studies showed that the phenotype of macrophages derived from spleen is different from those of bone marrow. Together, these results demonstrate that splenocytes can seed bone marrow of myeloablated mice and modulate atherosclerosis. In addition, our study shows the potential of splenocytes for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory disease."
