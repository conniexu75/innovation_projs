https://openalex.org/W1493841569,"Erythropoietin is the primary regulator of red blood cell formation in mammals. Because of its extreme scarcity, very little information is available regarding structural features of this important glycoprotein. We report here the primary structure of human urinary erythropoietin, determined by protein sequencing. In addition, the sites of glycosylation, assignment of disulfide bonds, and the circular dichroism of the hormone analyzed for secondary structure in comparison with the prediction from the sequence are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1501075384,"We have used a monoclonal antibody to purify glucocorticoid-receptor complexes from WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells. Molybdate-stabilized, nonactivated complexes were found to contain two distinct proteins which could be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. One of the proteins, 100 kDa, was labeled when cytosol was incubated with the affinity ligand [3H]dexamethasone 21-mesylate. The second protein, 90 kDa, was not labeled. Several lines of evidence, including Western blot analysis of purified nonactivated complexes, indicate that only the 100-kDa protein is directly recognized by the antibody. The 90-kDa protein appears to be purified as a component of the nonactivated complex due to noncovalent association with the 100-kDa protein. Both the 100-kDa and 90-kDa components of the nonactivated complex become labeled with 35S when cells are grown in medium containing [35S]methionine. Using cells labeled in this manner, we have shown that activated (i.e. DNA-binding) cytosolic complexes, formed by warming either in intact cells or under cell-free conditions, contain only the 100-kDa protein. Complexes extracted from nuclei of warmed cells similarly contain only the 100-kDa protein. These results indicate that the 100-kDa and 90-kDa components of nonactivated complexes separate upon activation. Purification of nonactivated complexes from cells grown in medium containing [32P]orthophosphoric acid indicates that both the 100-kDa and 90-kDa components are phosphoproteins which can be labeled with 32P. Therefore, resolution of the two proteins will be essential in order to determine whether the receptor is dephosphorylated on activation."
https://openalex.org/W1598177992,"Synthesis of total protein and of transthyretin in rat choroid plexus was studied by measuring the incorporation of radioactive leucine into proteins in choroid plexus tissue incubated in vitro. About 20% of the protein newly synthesized in choroid plexus and about 50% of the newly synthesized protein secreted into the medium was transthyretin. Evidently, the choroid plexus is very active in the biosynthesis of this carrier protein for thyroid hormones and could be an important link in the chemical communication between the body and the central nervous system. Acute inflammation, which leads to a profound rearrangement of the pattern of plasma protein synthesis rates in the liver, produced distinct changes in the levels for plasma protein mRNAs in the liver. The levels of the mRNAs for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and major acute phase alpha 1-protein increased more than 30-fold, those for transthyretin and albumin decreased to 27 and 57% of normal, respectively. The pattern of the observed changes in the levels of mRNAs for plasma proteins in the liver was independent of whether the acute inflammation was produced by subcutaneous injection of turpentine or intraperitoneal injection of a suspension of talcum. However, levels of transthyretin mRNA in choroid plexus were affected only very slightly, or not at all. Apparently, transthyretin synthesis in liver and choroid plexus is regulated independently during the acute phase response. No mRNA was detected in choroid plexus for albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and major acute phase alpha 1-protein under any conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1595914273,"Bacteriophage Mu utilizes two converging promoters to regulate the lytic and lysogenic pathways. Messenger RNA encoding the repressor gene is synthesized leftward from a promoter (PcM) located 1066 base pairs from the Mu left end. This transcript overlaps and is complementary to RNA synthesized rightward from the early promoter (PE) for transposase and replication proteins which initiates transcription at base pair 1028. Purified Mu repressor binds to three distinct operator sites (O1, O2, and O3); repressor binding at O2 blocks RNA polymerase binding at PE and repressor binding at O3 blocks RNA polymerase binding at PcM. O1 and O2 have higher affinity for repressor than O3, and transcription from PE is blocked at repressor concentrations that do not affect PcM. Thus, maintenance of the lysogenic state and autoregulation of the repressor gene is achieved by RNA polymerase transcription through DNA-repressor ensembles at O1 and O2. Integration host factor (IHF) encoded by the Escherichia coli him A and him D genes binds to Mu operator DNA between sites O1 and O2. IHF enhances transcription from PE 3-5-fold on supercoiled plasmid substrates in vitro and in Mu monolysogens in vivo. In vitro, IHF simultaneously decreases transcription from PcM 5-10-fold which results in a 25-fold change in lytic transcription relative to repressor transcription. A model for regulating the Mu lysis-lysogeny decision is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1576821632,"Peptides produced by mild chymotryptic digestion of human erythrocyte protein 4.1 mimic the ability of intact 4.1 to promote the binding of spectrin to F-actin. This complex-promoting activity was found to reside in an 8-kDa peptide which was fully functional when dissociated from other protein 4.1-derived peptides, indicating that noncovalent complexes of multiple peptides were not essential for activity. The 8-kDa peptide was incorporated into a ternary complex with spectrin and F-actin in approximately stoichiometric amounts. Amino acid composition and two-dimensional peptide mapping show that the 8-kDa active peptide is located within the 10-kDa region of protein 4.1 which contains a cAMP-dependent phosphorylated site."
https://openalex.org/W1603146813,"It has been proposed that alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis mediate the genesis of lethal cell injury with an acute oxidative stress. It is shown here, however, that such changes can be dissociated by two different means from the cell death occurring with the exposure of cultured hepatocytes to hydrogen peroxide generated either in the medium by glucose oxidase or intracellularly by the mechanism of menadione. The chelation of intracellular ferric iron with deferoxamine inhibits the formation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide and prevents cell killing. Deferoxamine did not prevent, however, an elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ ion concentration detected as an activation of phosphorylase alpha. Sulfhydryl reagents inhibited the rise in phosphorylase alpha activity in deferoxamine-pretreated hepatocytes. Conversely, cultured hepatocytes were depleted of Ca2+ ions by treatment with EGTA in a calcium-free medium. Calcium-depleted cells were not resistant to the toxicity of hydrogen peroxide despite the virtual elimination of the activation of phosphorylase alpha. In contrast, it was possible to kill cultured hepatocytes by a mechanism dependent upon a disordered intracellular calcium homeostasis using hepatocytes pretreated in calcium-free medium with the ionophore A23187. These cells were killed in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of calcium ions to the culture medium in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mM. There was a similar dose-dependent activation of phosphorylase alpha, but phosphorylase alpha activities were higher than with H2O2 at comparable cell killing. Deferoxamine pretreatment and sulfhydryl reagents had no effect on the loss of viability with this calcium-dependent cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W1583588612,"Some biological characteristics of cancer cells and solid tumors are identifiable by the high resolution NMR relaxation behavior of their nonaqueous components. Chemical analysis and two-dimensional scalar correlated (COSY) NMR spectroscopy show these resonances arise from neutral lipid in the plasma membrane. Triglyceride is shown to be the main plasma membrane component giving rise to the NMR spectrum, while soluble nonmembrane components account for 90% of the remaining resonances in the spectrum of intact cells. The presence of triglyceride has been detected by chemical analysis in highly purified plasma membranes from two different cell lines. The COSY spectra of cancer cells are comparable with that obtained for the triglyceride-rich very low density human lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1481650860,"An inborn murine cholesterol storage disorder exists which is characterized by a lesion in intracellular cholesterol esterification not accounted for by any discernible abnormality in acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (Pentchev, P.G., Boothe, A.D., Kruth, H.S., Weintroub, H., Stivers, J., and Brady, R.O. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5784-5791). Current studies have shown that the level of esterification of nonlipoprotein-derived [3H]cholesterol in cultured fibroblasts from heterozygous mutant mice was intermediary between the level found in normal fibroblasts and the deficient level found in fibroblasts from homozygous mutant mice. Homozygous-affected fibroblasts took up and converted [3H]desmosterol to [3H]cholesterol at a normal rate indicating that the murine mutation does not compromise the transport of exogenous sterol to microsomes. In contrast to the defect in esterification of exogenously derived cholesterol, synthesis of cholesteryl ester from [3H]mevalonic acid and [3H]squalene was normal in affected fibroblasts as was the stimulation of cholesteryl ester synthesis from endogenous cholesterol induced by 25-hydroxycholesterol. In surveying a number of mutant cell lines from human metabolic disorders with phenotypic manifestations similar in part to the mutant cholesterol storage mouse, Niemann-Pick C fibroblasts displayed a similar defect in esterification of exogenously derived cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1912337284,"Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of hypusine from deoxyhypusine in eukaryotic initiation factor 4D, has been partially purified from rat testis. The partially purified enzyme requires only the addition of certain sulfhydryl compounds for catalytic activity, dithiothreitol being the most effective. Its lack of dependency on the alpha-keto acid-dependent dioxygenase cofactors, Fe2+, alpha-ketoglutarate, and ascorbic acid, its failure to decarboxylate stoichiometrically alpha-ketoglutarate with deoxyhypusine hydroxylation, and its strong and specific inhibition by Fe2+ all suggest a catalytic mechanism of this enzyme unlike that of the prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W278790693,"Single-pulse (approximately 8 ns) ultraviolet laser excitation of protein-nucleic acid complexes can result in efficient and rapid covalent cross-linking of proteins to nucleic acids. The reaction produces no nucleic acid-nucleic acid or protein-protein cross-links, and no nucleic acid degradation. The efficiency of cross-linking is dependent on the wavelength of the exciting radiation, on the nucleotide composition of the nucleic acid, and on the total photon flux. The yield of cross-links/laser pulse is largest between 245 and 280 nm; cross-links are obtained with far UV photons (200-240 nm) as well, but in this range appreciable protein degradation is also observed. The method has been calibrated using the phage T4-coded gene 32 (single-stranded DNA-binding) protein interaction with oligonucleotides, for which binding constants have been measured previously by standard physical chemical methods (Kowalczykowski, S. C., Lonberg, N., Newport, J. W., and von Hippel, P. H. (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 145, 75-104). Photoactivation occurs primarily through the nucleotide residues of DNA and RNA at excitation wavelengths greater than 245 nm, with reaction through thymidine being greatly favored. The nucleotide residues may be ranked in order of decreasing photoreactivity as: dT much greater than dC greater than rU greater than rC, dA, dG. Cross-linking appears to be a single-photon process and occurs through single nucleotide (dT) residues; pyrimidine dimer formation is not involved. Preliminary studies of the individual proteins of the five-protein T4 DNA replication complex show that gene 43 protein (polymerase), gene 32 protein, and gene 44 and 45 (polymerase accessory) proteins all make contact with DNA, and can be cross-linked to it, whereas gene 62 (polymerase accessory) protein cannot. A survey of other nucleic acid-binding proteins has shown that E. coli RNA polymerase, DNA polymerase I, and rho protein can all be cross-linked to various nucleic acids by the laser technique. The potential uses of this procedure in probing protein-nucleic acid interactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488034370,"Cell surface carbohydrates and complementary carbohydrate receptors may mediate cell-cell recognition during neuronal development. To model such interactions, we developed a technique to test the ability of cell surface lipids (particularly glycosphingolipids) to mediate specific cell recognition and adhesion (Blackburn, C.C., and Schnaar, R.L. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1180-1188). When cells were incubated on plastic microwells adsorbed with various glycolipids, carbohydrate-specific cell adhesion was readily detected. We report here the use of this method to study adhesion of embryonic chick neural retina cells to purified cell surface lipids. Rapid and specific cell adhesion was observed when the neural retina cells were incubated on surfaces adsorbed with gangliosides (an important class of neuronal cell surface glycoconjugates) but not on surfaces adsorbed with various neutral glycosphingolipids, phospholipids, or sulfatide. This suggests that the observed cell adhesion was specific for the carbohydrate moiety of the adsorbed ganglioside and was not due to nonspecific ionic or hydrophobic interactions. Although the surface density of adsorbed lipid required to support cell adhesion was the same for all gangliosides examined, the extent of adhesion varied when different purified gangliosides were used. Ganglioside-specific adhesion was not dependent on the presence of calcium (at 37 degrees C) and was attenuated by pretreatment of the cells with trypsin. The extent of ganglioside-directed neural retinal cell adhesion varied with embryonic age. These results imply that gangliosides may play a role in cell-cell recognition in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1502429514,"The relationship between the concentration of cytosolic free ([Ca2+]i) and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) was investigated in isolated bovine parathyroid cells using the fluorescent indicator, quin 2. Increasing the concentration of extracellular from 0.5 to 2.0 mM caused a 3-fold increase in [Ca2+]i (from 183 +/- 4 to 568 +/- 21 nM) which was associated with a 2-4-fold decrease in secretion of PTH. Decreasing extracellular to about 1 microM caused a corresponding fall in [Ca2+]i to 60-90 nM. Extracellular Ca2+-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were not affected by omission of extracellular Na+. Depolarizing concentrations of K+ (30 mM) depressed [Ca2+]i at all concentrations of extracellular Ca examined, and this was associated with increased secretion of PTH. Ionomycin (0.1 or 1 microM) increased [Ca2+]i at extracellular concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM, but inhibited secretion of PTH only at Ca concentrations near the Ca2+ set point (1.25 microM). In contrast, dopamine, norepinephrine (10 microM each), and Li+ (20 mM) potentiated secretion of PTH without causing any detectable change in [Ca2+]i. The results obtained with these latter secretagogues provide evidence for a mechanism of secretion which is independent of net changes in [Ca2+]i. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) did not alter [Ca2+]i or secretion of PTH at low (0.5 mM) extracellular concentrations. At 2.0 mM extracellular Ca2+, however, TPA (20 nM or 1 microM) depressed [Ca2+]i and potentiated secretion of PTH. The addition of TPA prior to raising the extracellular concentration reduced the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i. The results show that the effects of TPA on secretion in the parathyroid cell are not readily dissociated from changes in [Ca2+]i and suggest that some TPA-sensitive process, perhaps involving protein kinase C, may be involved in those mechanisms that regulate [Ca2+]i in response to changes in extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1573416467,"Immunochemical studies have demonstrated that apoprotein B-100 and apoprotein B-48 share some antigenic determinants, but whether they are products of the same gene has remained uncertain. Utilizing a specific mouse monoclonal antibody, MB19, we recently characterized a common form of genetic polymorphism that was expressed in apo-B-100 (Young, S. G., Bertics, S. J., Curtiss, L. K., Casal, D. C., and Witztum, J.L. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). Antibody MB19 binds different allotypes of apo-B-100 (MB19(1) and MB19(2] with high and low affinities, respectively. Compared to a rabbit antiserum against human low density lipoprotein, which detects 100% of apo-B mass in all individuals, antibody MB19 detects 100% of apo-B with allotype MB19(1) but less than 10% of apo-B with allotype MB19(2). Western blots demonstrate that MB19 binds to both apo-B-100 and apo-B-48. To determine if apo-B-48 and apo-B-100 from the same individual express the same polymorphism, chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins were isolated from 23 subjects in whom the allotypes of apo-B-100 were known. Delipidated apoproteins were separated electrophoretically and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with 125I-MB19 (to detect the polymorphism) and 131I-antiserum to human apo-B (to quantitate total apo-B transferred to nitrocellulose membranes). Apo-B-100 and apo-B-48 bands were removed and the ratio of 125/131 counts in each band was calculated. In all 23 subjects studied, the same MB19 polymorphism was present in both apo-B-100 and apo-B-48. This observation provides strong evidence that both apoproteins are products of the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1542650142,"Studies of low density lipoprotein (LDL) metabolism in nonhuman model systems have indicated that the mammalian liver has dual mechanisms for the uptake and regulation of the concentration of plasma LDL. Heretofore, direct evaluation of lipoprotein uptake mechanisms in human hepatocytes has not been possible. In order to compare hepatocyte LDL uptake with fibroblast LDL metabolism, human hepatocytes were isolated and cultured from small biopsy specimens obtained from normolipidemic and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Cells cultured in serum-free culture medium retained the morphological and biochemical characteristics of hepatocytes for at least 7 days. The uptake and degradation of LDL by hepatocytes was compared to that of the cultured human fibroblasts. Like fibroblasts, hepatocytes bound, internalized, and degraded LDL. In both cell types, uptake approached saturation at a concentration of 50 micrograms of LDL protein/ml. Competition for LDL binding by LDL, high density lipoprotein, and modified LD revealed that the hepatocyte binding was specific for LDL. Cellular cholesterol loading by incubation in LDL-enriched culture medium resulted in diminished LDL uptake in both cell types. Chemical modification of LDL by acetoacetylation, acetylation, and reductive methylation abolished LDL uptake and degradation by fibroblasts. However, hepatocytes bound and degraded the modified LDL at 30-50% the level of native LDL. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemic hepatocytes were devoid of the LDL receptor pathway but metabolized native LDL to the extent observed with modified LDL uptake by normal hepatocytes. In contrast to the classic LDL receptor pathway, the second or alternate pathway does not lead to regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. These findings indicate the presence of two separate pathways of LDL uptake in human hepatocytes which have different effects on hepatocytic cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1581881472,"Cholesteryl ester accumulation in arterial wall macrophages (foam cells) is a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions. We have previously shown that J774 macrophages accumulate large amounts of cholesteryl ester when incubated with unmodified low density lipoprotein (LDL) and that this is related to sluggish down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. To further explore intracellular cholesterol metabolism and regulatory events in J774 macrophages, we studied the effect of inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) on the cells' ability to accumulate cholesterol and to down-regulate receptor and reductase. Treatment of J774 cells with LDL in the presence of ACAT inhibitor 58-035 (Sandoz) prevented both cholesteryl ester and total cholesterol accumulation. Furthermore, 58-035 markedly enhanced down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the presence of LDL. In dose-response studies, down-regulation of the receptor by 58-035 paralleled its inhibition of ACAT activity. Compound 58-035 also increased the down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and acetyl-LDL but not in the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, which is not an ACAT substrate. The ability of 58-035 to enhance LDL receptor down-regulation was negated when cells were simultaneously incubated with recombinant high density lipoprotein3 discs, which promote cellular cholesterol efflux. In contrast to the findings with J774 macrophages, down-regulation of the human fibroblast LDL receptor was not enhanced by 58-035. These data suggest that in J774 macrophages, but not in fibroblasts, ACAT competes for a regulatory pool of intracellular cholesterol, contributing to diminished receptor and reductase down-regulation, LDL-cholesterol accumulation, and foam cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W1665676985,"Abstract Infrared spectroscopy in the interval from 1800 to 1300 cm-1 has been used to investigate the secondary structure and the hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior of bacteriorhodopsin and bovine rhodopsin in their respective native membranes. The amide I' and amide II' regions from spectra of membrane suspensions in D2O were decomposed into constituent bands by use of a curve-fitting procedure. The amide I' bands could be fit with a minimum of three theoretical components having peak positions at 1664, 1638, and 1625 cm-1 for bacteriorhodopsin and 1657, 1639, and 1625 cm-1 for rhodopsin. For both of these membrane proteins, the amide I' spectrum suggests that alpha-helix is the predominant form of peptide chain secondary structure, but that a substantial amount of beta-sheet conformation is present as well. The shape of the amide I' band was pH-sensitive for photoreceptor membranes, but not for purple membrane, indicating that membrane-bound rhodopsin undergoes a conformation change at acidic pH. Peptide hydrogen exchange of bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin was monitored by observing the change in the ratio of integrated absorbance (Aamide II'/Aamide I') during the interval from 1.5 to 25 h after membranes were introduced into buffered D2O. The fraction of peptide groups in a very slowly exchanging secondary structure was estimated to be 0.71 for bacteriorhodopsin at pD 7. The corresponding fraction in vertebrate rhodopsin was estimated to be less than or equal to 0.60. These findings are discussed in relationship to previous studies of hydrogen exchange behavior and to structural models for both proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1520463777,"The [2Fe-2S] clusters of Thermus Rieske protein, which were previously found to have nitrogen atoms coordinated directly to the iron (Cline, J.F., Hoffman, B.M., LaHaie, E., Ballou, D.P., and Fee, J.A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3251-3254), are now shown to have a tightly linked ionization that affects the spectral and redox properties of the cluster. The data are consistent with the reactions LH+, Fe3+ in equilibrium with L-Fe3+ +H+ and L-Fe3+ + H+ + e in equilibrium with LH+, Fe2+, where L is coordinated to Fe3+ but LH+ may not be, depending on its structure. The pKa of the protonic equilibrium is approximately 8 and the midpoint potential, Em7, is approximately 140 mV. Possible structures of L are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1592233351,"The minimal P1 replicon encompasses an open reading frame for the essential replication protein, RepA, bracketed by two sets of multiple 19-base pair repeated sequences, incA and incC. This study focused on the interaction of RepA with the incC and incA repeated sequences because earlier studies suggested that incA might control P1 copy number by titrating limiting amounts of RepA and because the incC repeats, which are part of the origin of replication, contain the promoter for repA. RepA is essential for origin function, autoregulates its own synthesis from the promoter, and, when overproduced, blocks origin function. In this study, RepA was overproduced from an expression vector and purified to 90% homogeneity. The binding of RepA to the DNA encompassing repeat sequences was assayed by monitoring the mobility of protein-DNA complexes on polyacrylamide gels. Distinct species of retarded bands were seen with the maximum number of bands corresponding to the number of repeats present in the target fragment. No evidence was found for RepA binding to fragments not containing the repeats. This suggests that the specific binding of RepA to the repeats may be involved in each of the diverse activities of RepA."

https://openalex.org/W1497906014,"Given a specified DNA sequence and starting with an idealized conformation for the double helix (A-DNA or B-DNA), the dependence of conformational energy on variations in the local geometry of the double helix can be examined by computer modeling. By averaging over all thermally accessible states, it is possible to determine 1) how the optimum local structure differs from the initial idealized conformation and 2) the energetic costs of small structural deformations. This paper describes such a study. Tables are presented for the prediction of helix twist angles and base pair roll angles for both A-DNA and B-DNA when the sequence has been specified. Local deviations of helix parameters from their average values can accumulate to produce a net curvature of the molecule, a curvature that can be sharp enough to be experimentally detectable. As an independent check on the method, the calculations provide predictions for the longitudinal compressibility (Young's modulus) and the average torsional stiffness, both of which are in good agreement with experimental values. In examining the role of sequence-dependent variations in helix structure for the recognition of specific sequences by proteins, we have calculated the energy needed to deform the self-complementary hexanucleotide d(CAATTG) to match the local geometry of d(GAATTC), which is the sequence recognized by the EcoRI restriction endonuclease. That energy would be sufficient to reduce the binding of the incorrect sequence to the protein by over 2 orders of magnitude relative to the correct sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1567264882,"Heparin was fractionated by affinity chromatography on immobilized antithrombin III followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. Eighteen fractions were obtained ranging in molecular weight from 9,700 to 34,300 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium. The binding stoichiometries of antithrombin III and thrombin interactions with the heparin of these fractions were measured, using changes in intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence. Catalytic activity also was measured for each of the heparin fractions. As the molecular weight of heparin varied from about 10,000 to 30,000, the average number of antithrombin and thrombin sites/heparin molecule varied from 1.0 to 2.1 and 2.4 to 6.8. In addition, the molar specific activity increased 5.7-fold, an increase which correlated directly with the product of the number of antithrombin III and thrombin molecules bound. Thus as the number of bound molecules increased with increased molecular weight, the rate of reaction/bound antithrombin III increased in proportion to the number of bound thrombin molecules and vice versa. This can be explained by assuming that heparin functions as a template for both proteins, that all bound thrombin and antithrombin III molecules are accessible to each other, and that the rate at which a bound molecule reacts is proportional to the number of molecules of its interacting counterpart bound. These observations and conclusions are similar to those of Hoylaerts et al. (Hoylaerts, M., Owen, W. G., and Collen, D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5670-5677), who demonstrated that the rate at which single molecules of antithrombin III, covalently attached to heparin, react increases as the thrombin binding capacity (chain length) of heparin increases."
https://openalex.org/W1563778621,"Purification of human platelet phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from a particulate fraction by ion-exchange chromatography at 4 degrees C yielded a single peak of enzyme activity, which catalyzed the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid from the 2-position of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). The activity toward PtdCho and that toward PtdEtn differed in stability during storage, pH optimum, Ca2+ requirement, and affinity for the substrate; however, each activity preferred phospholipid with arachidonate at the 2-position. The two activities appeared to be eluted as an aggregate in a single peak from the ion-exchange column. When the column was run at 22 degrees C, an additional PLA2 activity peak specific for PtdEtn was resolved from the original PLA2 peak. But when the particulate fraction was briefly sonicated in 0.1% octylglucoside before chromatography at 22 degrees C, a different PLA2 activity peak, specific for PtdCho, was obtained. Resolution of the two specific forms of PLA2 under different conditions probably resulted from selective solubilization of the aggregate. The specific PLA2 activities thus isolated were very labile, whereas those in the aggregate were relatively stable. These findings suggest that human platelets contain at least two substrate-specific forms of PLA2, one for PtdCho and another for PtdEtn."
https://openalex.org/W1533713732,"To investigate the temporal and topographic changes in the expression of various collagens during the process of endochondral bone formation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of the collagens synthesized by organ cultures from the separated presumptive calcification and permanent cartilaginous regions of embryonic chick sternum at various stages of development was performed. Special emphasis was placed on the study of Type X collagen, a recently described species that may play a role in tissue calcification. We found that Type X collagen is biosynthesized exclusively by cartilage from the zone of presumptive calcification and that its biosynthetic expression is acquired at stage 43 (day 17) of sternal development. Quantitative analysis indicated that Type X was the biosynthetic product which showed the most dramatic changes increasing markedly with increased sternal age. While no Type X collagen could be detected at stage 40, it represented about 12% of the total collagen synthesized at stage 43, further increasing to 45% at stage 46 of sternal development. The increase in Type X collagen in the presumptive calcification region was accompanied by a relative decrease in the proportion of 1 alpha, 2 alpha, 3 alpha, alpha 1(II), and Type IX collagens. In contrast, the permanent hyaline cartilage did not display detectable synthesis of Type X collagen at any sternal age. The strict topographic distribution and the temporal expression of Type X collagen biosynthesis coincident with the development of sternal calcification, confirm the notion that this collagen may play an important role in the extracellular matrix remodeling associated with the initiation and progression of tissue calcification."
https://openalex.org/W2108059256,"The inability of the fetal and immature Leydig cell to be desensitized by gonadotropin treatment, a characteristic of the adult cell, is attributed to the absence of an estrogen-mediated regulation of the androgen pathway. Cultures of fetal rat Leydig cells were employed to analyze this differential response. The fetal rat Leydig cells revealed low aromatization capacity, undetectable estradiol production, a low level of estrogen receptors, and a minimally detectable level of an estradiol-regulated protein. However, exogenous estradiol caused up-regulation of its own receptor, increase of an estradiol-regulated protein, and induction of a steroidogenic lesion at the microsomal level, resulting in decreased androgen production. This estrogen-mediated enzymatic inhibition resembles that observed in gonadotropin-desensitized adult Leydig cells. The absence of this regulation in fetal life is likely due to insufficient aromatase activity, with lack of consequent receptor-mediated estrogen action.

The rebinding of oxygen to the ferrous cytochrome proceeded monophasically, and the second order rate constant was 7.8 X 10(7) M-1 s-1, the off rate constant 5.6 X 10(3) s-1, and the calculated dissociation constant for the oxygenated compound 7.2 X 10(-5) M at pH 7.3 and 25 degrees C. Rapid scanning spectroscopy revealed the formation of chytochrome o-O2 directly from ferrous chytochrome o and oxygen without any evidence for an intermediary formation of Compound D, another type of oxygenated chytochrome o. Photodissociation in solution containing CO/O2 mixtures resulted in rapid binding of oxygen followed by slow replacement by CO. This property as well as the photodissociability of chytochrome o-O2 suggests that the heme iron of the compound is in the ferrous state. In addition, the primary oxygen compound was fairly stable and did not decay further in the absence of CO, in marked contrast with that of mammalian cytochrome oxidase primary oxygen compound which rapidly decayed. This result suggests a possible role of this cytochrome as an oxygen carrier or storage."

The region of rat 5 S rRNA that is protected by protein L5 from digestion with the ribonuclease alpha-sarcin includes nucleotides 1-10, 12-22, and 64-116. This domain approximates the combined binding sites for the three proteins (L5, L18, and L25) that associate with Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA. In addition, the region of 5 S rRNA protected by rat ribosomal protein L5 corresponds closely to that occupied by Xenopus transcription factor IIIA."
https://openalex.org/W1586684853,"The complete amino acid sequence of the myoglobin from Dolabella auricularia, a common gastropodic mollusc on the Japanese coast, has been determined. The myoglobin is composed of 146 amino acid residues, is acetylated at the NH2 terminus, and contains a single histidine residue at position 95 which most likely corresponds to the heme-binding proximal histidine. The sequence of Dolabella myoglobin shows strong homology (72-77%) with those of Aplysia myoglobins. The autoxidation rate of Dolabella oxymyoglobin (MbO2) was examined in 0.1 M buffer at 25 degrees C over pH range 4.8-12. Dolabella MbO2 was extremely unstable between pH 7 and 11, and the pH dependence of the stability was quite different from that of sperm whale MbO2. This property may be partly due to the absence of a distal (E7) histidine in Dolabella myoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1523991913,"The retinal Schiff base of halorhodopsin deprotonates with a pKa of 7.4 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 in the dark. In the presence of various anions, such as chloride or nitrate, etc., the pKa is raised by up to 1.5 units. Analysis of the dependency of the pKa on anion concentration favors the model in which the anions do not bind to the positively charged Schiff base nitrogen, but to a site near it, and exert their effect on the pKa by direct (perhaps electrostatic) interaction. Adding nitrate, or one of several other anions, causes also a small blueshift in the visible absorption band of the chromophore. These effects on the pKa and the absorption band define an anion binding site in halorhodopsin, termed Site I. Chloride and bromide apparently bind in addition to another site, which is associated with a small red-shift of the absorption band and changes in the photocycle. This other anion binding site is termed Site II. Illumination of halorhodopsin samples results in the deprotonation of the Schiff base with a much lowered pKa, but at very low rates probably determined by the generation of a deprotonating photointermediate. Binding of Site I anions increases the pKa of deprotonation in the light also. The similarity of the responses of the apparent pKa in the dark and in the light to anion concentration suggests that anion binding to Site I influences deprotonation of the Schiff base similarly in the photointermediate and in the parent halorhodopsin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1522899075,"Species-specific reaggregation of cells from the marine sponge Microciona prolifera is mediated by a proteoglycan-like aggregation factor (MAF) of Mr = 2 X 10(7) which has two functional domains, a cell binding domain and an aggregation factor interaction domain. After extensive trypsin digestion, over 60% of the MAF mass was converted into a glycopeptide fragment of Mr = 10,000 (T-10) which is therefore a representative part of the major portion, but not of the entire MAF molecule. The T-10 fragment has a similar amino acid and carbohydrate composition as the intact MAF and displays species-specific binding. Although T-10 also inhibited MAF association with homotypic cells, its apparent affinity is 3 X 10(6) M-1, i.e. 13,000 times lower than that of native MAF. Reconstitution of binding affinity in the same order of magnitude as native MAF (Ka = 10(10) M-1) was obtained by cross-linking the glycopeptide fragment into polymers of the approximate size of MAF (Mr greater than 1.5 X 10(7) using diepoxybutane and glutaraldehyde, or periodate oxidation and glutaraldehyde. The apparent association constants of intermediate polymers with Mr = 1 X 10(5), 6 X 10(5), 9 X 10(5), 2 X 10(6) and above 1.5 X 10(7) increased proportionally to their size and were in line with association constants of MAF degradation fragments. Since the binding affinity of the T-10 glycopeptide fragment could be reconstituted by cross-linking, and since this fragment accounts for over 60% of MAF, we propose that the specificity and high affinity of the MAF-cell association is based on a highly polyvalent interaction of low affinity cell-binding sites. Such a polyvalency of the cell binding domain is advantageous for efficient cell-cell interactions and thus differs from most known interaction molecules and receptors characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1531422723,"Band 3, the anion transport protein of the human erythrocyte membrane, is known to be phosphorylated in ghosts at tyrosine 8. The band 3 tyrosine kinase is now shown to be associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble membrane skeleton but not with spectrin or actin. The kinase was reversibly dissociated from membranes and skeletons at elevated ionic strength (50% at mu = 0.15). The binding capacity of the membranes exceeded their native complement of the kinase by at least 60-fold. Prior removal of all peripheral proteins from the cytoplasmic surface of inside-out vesicles did not diminish the rebinding of the kinase, whereas prior removal of band 3 and other accessory proteins from skeletons abolished the rebinding of the kinase. An excess of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, which binds to band 3 in the region of the phosphate acceptor tyrosine 8, both inhibited the phosphorylation of band 3 and released the kinase into solution. Soluble 40/45-kDa chymotryptic fragments from the cytoplasmic pole of band 3 were phosphorylated at least as well as membranous band 3 and caused the release of the kinase from Triton-extracted skeletons. Membrane skeletons lacked most of the membrane band 3, but retained most of the kinase. Nevertheless, the band 3 population solubilized by Triton X-100 from prelabeled ghosts was as well phosphorylated as the population of band 3 retained by the skeletons. Furthermore, the fraction of band 3 not associated with the skeletons following Triton X-100 extraction was a good substrate for the solubilized kinase. We conclude that this tyrosine kinase is reversibly bound to the membrane through electrostatic interactions with the polyacidic sequence surrounding the phosphate accepting tyrosine 8 on band 3. The kinase appears to be preferentially linked to those band 3 molecules associated with the membrane skeleton, but it impartially phosphorylates band 3 species free in the bilayer as well as band 3 fragments in solution. The resemblance of its plasma membrane binding behavior to that of tyrosine kinases of certain viruses causing oncogenic transformation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532029655,"The effect of unsaturated and saturated nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) on the electrophoretic, immunological, and steroid-binding properties of human sex hormone-binding protein (SBP) were investigated. Tests were carried out on whole serum from pregnant women and on purified SBP using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, crossed immunoelectrophoresis with autoradiography, and equilibrium dialysis. All three methods showed that NEFAs influence the binding of sex steroids to SBP both in whole serum and with the purified protein. Saturated NEFAs caused a 1.5-2-fold increase in binding of dehydrotestosterone, testosterone, and estradiol to SBP, while unsaturated NEFAs, such as oleic (18:1) and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids inhibited the binding of these steroids to SBP. Thus, unsaturated NEFAs in the concentration range 1-100 microM are more inhibitory for estradiol binding than for testosterone or dehydrotestosterone binding. In addition to these binding changes, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoretic studies revealed a shift in SBP from the slow-moving active native form to a fast-moving inactive one. There was also a reduction in the apparent SBP concentration by Laurell immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of unsaturated NEFA (5.5 nmol of NEFA/pmol of protein). These studies indicate that unsaturated NEFAs induce conformational changes in human SBP which are reflected in its electrophoretic, immunological, and steroid-binding properties. They suggest that the fatty acid content of the SBP environment may result in lower steroid hormone binding and thus increased free hormone levels."
https://openalex.org/W1643749360,"The biosynthesis of two tetrahydropterin intermediates (H4pterin-1 and H4pterin-2), their conversion to tetrahydrobiopterin, and their overall chemical structures are described. A new high performance liquid chromatographic separation of these and other tetrahydropterins is also described. The biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin from dihydroneopterin triphosphate proceeds in the presence of the bovine adrenal medullary biosynthetic enzymes, Mg2+, NADPH. The biosynthesis of H4pterin-2 occurs under identical conditions, and the compound accumulates in the presence of 1 to 10 microM of N-acetylserotonin, an inhibitor of sepiapterin reductase. At higher concentrations of the inhibitor, the synthesis of H4pterin-2 is also inhibited, and H4pterin-1 accumulates. H4pterin-1 also accumulates in the absence of NADPH. In the presence of NADPH the biosynthetic enzymes convert both intermediates to tetrahydrobiopterin at rates which are greater than the rate of conversion of dihydroneopterin triphosphate to tetrahydrobiopterin. Electrochemical, UV/VIS, oxidation, and ionization properties identify the compounds as tetrahydropterins. The side chain structures of the compounds were determined by a combination of chemical means. The structures of the compounds are 6R-(1',2'-dioxopropyl)-tetrahydropterin (H4pterin-1) and 6R-(L-1'-hydroxy-2'-oxopropyl)-tetrahydropterin (H4pterin-2). The data indicate that the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin from dihydroneopterin triphosphate proceeds in three steps: 1) formation of H4pterin-1 in the presence of Mg2+, 2) NADPH-dependent conversion of H4pterin-1 to H4pterin-2, and 3) NADPH-dependent conversion of H4pterin-2 to tetrahydrobiopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1601596454,"Low concentrations (0.5-6 nmol/g) of homocysteine (Hcy) have recently been demonstrated in acid extracts of various tissues of the mouse and rat (Ueland, P.M., Helland, S., Broch, O.-J., and Schanche, J.-S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2360-2364). This is referred to as free Hcy in tissues. This paper describes a method for the determination of protein-bound Hcy, which involves precipitation and washing of tissue protein with ammonium sulfate, release of Hcy from native proteins in the presence of dithioerythritol, and determination of free Hcy by a sensitive radioenzymic assay. Both free and bound Hcy decreased markedly in rat tissues within a few seconds following death of the animal. The amount of protein-bound Hcy was highest in liver, somewhat lower in kidney, brain, heart, lung, and spleen. The ratio between free and bound Hcy was between 1 and 2 in most tissues, except in cerebellum, containing a large excess of free Hcy (free/bound ratio of 18). Free Hcy was almost exclusively localized to the soluble fraction of rat liver, whereas protein-bound Hcy was about equally distributed between this fraction and the microsomes. Isolated rat hepatocytes contained free and protein-bound Hcy in proportions observed in whole liver, but a large amount of Hcy was exported into the extracellular medium. The half-lives, as determined from pulse-chase experiments with [35S] methionine, were 53 s for S-adenosylmethionine, 2 s for S-adenosylhomocysteine and 3 s for Hcy (free and bound regarded as a single pool). Furthermore, isotope equilibrium between these metabolites and between free and bound Hcy throughout the rapid chase period suggests the turnover rates of S-adenosylhomocysteine and Hcy to be production rate limited, and the dissociation rate of the Hcy-protein complex may greatly exceed the turnover rate of Hcy. Thus, the half-lives of Hcy are such that participation of both free and bound Hcy in metabolic regulation is feasible."
https://openalex.org/W1516544293,"Cytochrome b5 is an amphipathic integral membrane protein that spontaneously inserts, post-translationally, into intracellular membranes. When added to preformed phospholipid vesicles, it binds in a so-called loose or transferable configuration, characterized by the ability of the protein to rapidly equilibrate between vesicles. In a preliminary report we showed that the distribution of cytochrome b5 among a heterogeneous population of small sonicated phosphatidylcholine vesicles (212 to about 350 A in diameter) lies in favor of the smallest vesicles by a factor of at least 20 (Greenhut, S.F. and Roseman, M.A. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 5883-5886). In the present studies we have attempted to determine the maximal extent to which bilayer curvature can influence the intervesicle distribution of cytochrome b5, by measuring the distribution of the protein between a population of limit-size vesicles 212 A in diameter and a population of large unilamellar vesicles approximately 1000 A in diameter. (The effect of bilayer curvature on the physical properties of the lipids in the large vesicles is considered to be negligible.) The results show that cytochrome b5 favors the small vesicle population by a factor of about 200. This observation suggests that the formation of highly curved regions in biological membranes (or the formation of regions in which the physical state of the lipids is similar to that in small vesicles) may cause the accumulation of certain membrane proteins at those sites. We also observed that a significant fraction (11-20%) of the cytochrome b5, when added directly to the large vesicles, spontaneously inserts into the tight, physiologically proper configuration. A possible mechanism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1503319837,"Under conventional electron microscopy negatively stained phosphorylase kinase exhibits a bilobal structure resembling two bridged opposing parentheses. In this predominant particle orientation, usually only one bridge is observed; however, in many particles two bridges can be seen. Scanning transmission electron microscopy of unstained phosphorylase kinase shows very similar structures, with a particle mass equivalent to that of the hexadecameric holoenzyme. Partial digestion of the enzyme with chymotrypsin, which preferentially hydrolyzes the alpha-subunits, causes no significant changes in the structure; however, when both the alpha and beta subunits are degraded by trypsin, single lobed particles appear, i.e. the connecting bridges are missing. Mass analysis of scanning transmission electron microscopy images of trypsinized enzyme indicates that the protease does, in fact, split the particle into halves. Transmission electron microscopy of an alpha gamma delta complex isolated after incubation of the holoenzyme with LiBr shows only small particles approximately one-fourth the size of the holoenzyme. Thus, integrity of the beta subunit may be necessary in order for the two lobes of phosphorylase kinase to be bridged. These data also indicate that the subunits are arranged as a bridged dimer of octamers 2 (alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 delta 2)."

https://openalex.org/W98465441,"Abstract The xylene ring of riboflavin originates by dismutation of the precursor, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine. The formation of the latter compound requires a 4-carbon unit as the precursor of carbon atoms 6 alpha, 6, 7, and 7 alpha of the pyrazine ring. The formation of riboflavin from GTP and ribose phosphate by cell extract from Candida guilliermondii has been observed by Logvinenko et al. (Logvinenko, E. M., Shavlovsky, G. M., Zakal'sky, A. E., and Zakhodylo, I. V. (1982) Biokhimiya 47, 931-936). We have studied this enzyme reaction in closer detail using carbohydrate phosphates as substrates and synthetic 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione or its 5'-phosphate as cosubstrates. Several pentose phosphates and pentulose phosphates can serve as substrate for the formation of riboflavin with similar efficiency. The reaction requires Mg2+. Various samples of ribulose phosphate labeled with 14C or 13C have been prepared and used as enzyme substrates. Radioactivity was efficiently incorporated into riboflavin from [1-14C]ribulose phosphate, [3,5-14C]ribulose phosphate, and [5-14C]ribulose phosphate, but not from [4-14C]ribulose phosphate. Label from [1-13C]ribose 5-phosphate was incorporated into C6 and C8 alpha of riboflavin. [2,3,5-13C]Ribose 5-phosphate yielded riboflavin containing two contiguously labeled segments of three carbon atoms, namely 5a, 9a, 9 and 8, 7, 7 alpha. 5-Amino-6-[1'-14C] ribitylamino-2,4 (1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione transferred radioactivity exclusively to the ribityl side chain of riboflavin in the enzymatic reaction. It follows that the 4-carbon unit used for the biosynthesis of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine consists of the pentose carbon atoms 1, 2, 3, and 5 in agreement with earlier in vivo studies."
https://openalex.org/W1516090734,"Human melanoma cells synthesize a cell-associated chondroitin sulfate-rich proteoglycan, whose core protein is recognized by monoclonal antibody 9.2.27. We report that the core protein is present on the surface of melanoma cells in two forms, either free or modified by the addition of chondroitin sulfate chains, suggesting that the addition of glycosaminoglycan chains may not be a prerequisite for cell surface expression of the proteoglycan core protein. Free core protein found at the cell surface does not seem to represent an overflow of the proteoglycan synthetic pathway, since experiments using a beta-D-xyloside acceptor suggest that core protein is, in fact, limiting proteoglycan synthesis. NH4Cl inhibits the synthesis of melanoma-type proteoglycan, shifting the balance of surface core protein toward the free form. The inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis is apparently not due to a disruption of enzymes and precursors involved in glycosaminoglycan synthesis, since cells treated with NH4Cl retain their ability to initiate and elongate chondroitin 4-sulfate chains on a beta-D-xyloside acceptor. In contrast, the divalent ionophore monensin inhibited core protein maturation and synthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains. The effects of both NH4Cl and monensin were reversible; thus, experiments using the drugs sequentially indicated that monensin temporally precedes NH4Cl in interfering with proteoglycan biosynthesis. Since the NH4Cl and monensin share the property of inhibiting the acidification of intracellular vesicles within cells, the present findings raise the possibility that the accessibility of proteoglycan core protein to the Golgi site of glycosaminoglycan addition is regulated in melanoma cells by acidification of intracellular compartments."

https://openalex.org/W1535609254,"Chromatin fragments produced by mild nuclease digestion were chromatographed on Bio-Gel A-50m to give fractions ranging in size from 0.4 to 30 kilobase pair-DNA. The fragments that were larger than about 8-10 nucleosomes accounted for 80% of the chromatin, and the H1/core histone ratio was constant throughout these fractions. When adjusted to 150 mM NaCl, aggregates precipitated in each fraction, the largest fragments yielding 60% and the smallest 25%. In all of these fractions, after aggregation was induced by NaCl, the H1/core histone ratio in the aggregation-resistant chromatin (S) was 0.7 that in the aggregated chromatin (P). To show that the H1 deficiency and aggregation resistance were not produced by transfer of H1 from little fragments to bigger one, big aggregation-resistant fragments were incubated with little aggregation-prone fragments in 75 mM NaCl for 2 h, and readjusted to 150 mM. The little aggregation-prone fragments retained their aggregatibility after exposure to big aggregation-resistant fragments. By mixing [3H]P with [14C]S and vice versa, incubating at 75 mM NaCl for 2 h, and separating P from S with 150 mM NaCl, it was demonstrated that H1 histone did not equilibrate between S and P. Similarly, mixing combinations of radioactive and unlabeled, big and little, S and P fractions, and fractionating by size after 2 h or more incubation at 75 mM NaCl, it was shown that H1 equilibrates between different S fragments, and between different P fragments, but not between S and P. The distribution of H1 variants between S and P fractions was not correlated with the affinity of the variants for DNA. The order of binding affinities was H10 greater than H1ab = H1c, but the deficits of H1's in the aggregation-resistant S fractions were ranked H1ab greater than H1c greater than H10. It is suggested that chromatin is a mosaic of aggregation-resistant and aggregation-prone regions which differ in H1 content quantitatively and qualitatively."
https://openalex.org/W1570892620,"Glucocorticoid receptors of rat kidney and liver were compared by physicochemical and immunochemical methods to investigate the role of proteolysis in the formation of corticosteroid binder IB. Kidney cytosol prepared in the presence of sodium molybdate contained receptor forms comparable to rat liver glucocorticoid receptor; [3H]triamcinolone acetonide-labeled receptors eluted from Sephacryl S-300 as a multimeric 6.1 nm component in the presence of molybdate and as a monomeric 5.7 nm component in the absence of molybdate. Both forms were recognized by the monoclonal antibody BUGR-1 which was raised against rat liver glucocorticoid receptor. When kidney cytosol was prepared in the absence of molybdate, labeled receptor complexes eluted from Sephacryl S-300 as a 5.8 nm component in the presence of molybdate. However, in the absence of molybdate, the receptor eluted as a smaller 3.4 nm component which was identical with the size of activated kidney glucocorticoid receptor chromatographed in either the presence or absence of molybdate. The 3.4 nm activated kidney glucocorticoid receptor did not bind to DEAE-cellulose under conditions where activated liver receptor was retained. These properties of the activated kidney receptor are characteristic of corticosteroid binder IB. Incubation of the activated kidney receptor complex with BUGR-1 resulted in a shift in apparent Stokes radius from 3.4 nm to 5.4 nm, indicating immunochemical similarity with rat liver receptor. Identification of the immunoreactive receptor subunit by Western blotting demonstrated that kidney cytosol prepared in the presence of molybdate contained a major 94-kDa immunoreactive component which co-migrated with rat liver glucocorticoid receptor, while cytosol prepared in the absence of molybdate contained principally a 44-kDa immunoreactive species. These results suggest that corticosteroid binder IB can be generated by in vitro proteolysis and does not represent a polymorphic form of the glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1575940295,"Crystallization is the primary rate-limiting step in protein structure determination. It has been our experience over approximately 10 years that crystals are obtained in about 20% of the proteins attempted and that only about 10% of these crystals are sufficiently well ordered to permit atomic resolution structure analysis. In attempts to overcome this limitation, we have investigated the effect on crystallization of microheterogeneity in a protein regarded as pure by conventional criteria. Creatine kinase was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle and crystallized from methylpentanediol. The protein appeared to be nearly pure judging by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high specific activity. The crystals that were obtained were of poor quality, and an extensive survey of precipitants, crystallization conditions, and additives failed to discover conditions from which usable crystals could be obtained. The enzyme was then subjected to a series of further purification steps. After each purification step, the quality of the crystals obtained under almost identical conditions improved. The final purification step was flat-bed isoelectric focusing. Crystals grown from focused creatine kinase are well ordered and diffract to approximately 3-A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W87733739,"The relative orientation of the 3-arm of N-linked glycans in solution can be determined, in part, by two interresidue nuclear Overhauser enhancements. The existence of one of these enhancements, that observed to the H5 proton of the (alpha 1,3)-linked mannose (attached to the core beta-linked mannose) upon irradiation of the beta-linked mannose H2 proton, has been disputed by other investigators (Homans, S. W., Dwek, R. A., Fernandes, D. L., and Rademacher, T. W. (1983) FEBS Lett. 164, 231-235). To demonstrate unequivocally the existence of this interresidue enhancement, we have synthesized a mannotrioside to model the corresponding moiety in N-linked glycans. Just as in N-linked glycans, the disputed enhancement cannot be directly observed due to spectral overlap with other enhancements but is detectable by careful quantitative analysis. By employing specifically deuterated derivatives of the mannotrioside, however, the disputed enhancement can be directly visualized."
https://openalex.org/W1677834570,"The nuclear protein kinase NI (NI kinase) was purified from NB-15 mouse neuroblastoma cells by phosphocellulose column and casein affinity column chromatography. The purified NI kinase exhibited (i) an apparent subunit molecular weight of about 37,000, (ii) autophosphorylation, and (iii) insensitivity to inhibition by heparin. When NI kinase was added to heat-treated neuroblastoma nuclei in the presence of [gamma-32P] ATP, two proteins with apparent subunit molecular weights of 11,000 and 10,000 were prominently phosphorylated. Other protein kinases tested including the nuclear protein kinase NII, Type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and protein kinase C did not catalyze the phosphorylation of these two proteins. The NI kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of these two proteins was completely inhibited by 1 mM spermine. In contrast, 10 mM putrescine, 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM arginine, and 10 mM NH4Cl, had no inhibitory effect on this phosphorylation reaction. Our study also indicated that the phosphorylation of the 11,000- and 10,000-dalton proteins occurred in the nuclear matrix fraction but not in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, high mobility group proteins, or histone fractions. We have previously reported that spermine specifically inhibits the endogenous phosphorylation of an 11,000-dalton nuclear protein in various mammalian cell lines (Chen, K. Y., and Verma, R. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 118, 710-716). The present study suggests that the 11,000- and 10,000-dalton nuclear proteins may be native substrates of nuclear protein kinase NI and that their phosphorylation can be affected by physiological concentrations of spermine."
https://openalex.org/W1590231619,"Highly selective chromatography of microsomal enzymes has been carried out on columns of immobilized cytochrome b5 that was obtained by detergent solubilization (d-b5) of the complete amphipathic molecule. Several partially purified isozymes of cytochrome P-450 are resolved on d-b5 columns, and one high-affinity isozyme has been readily purified to homogeneity. Chromatographic selectivity and correlation of elution order of isozymes of cytochrome P-450 with direct spectral measurements of affinity constants suggests affinity chromatography on d-b5 columns. Substantial one-step enrichments of NADH-cytochrome-b5 reductase and an unstable cytochrome b5-dependent oxidase of cholesterol synthesis, 4-methyl sterol oxidase, have been obtained on d-b5 columns which further supports this conclusion. Comparison of chromatographic behavior on columns of immobilized cytochrome b5 that was obtained by trypsin solubilization (t-b5) with d-b5 columns shows marked differences which must be attributed to the absence of the hydrophobic domain of the t-b5 molecule. NADH-cytochrome-b5 reductase and the high affinity isozyme of cytochrome P-450 purified by d-b5 affinity chromatography are poorly retained on t-b5 columns. A different cytochrome P-450 isozyme with lower affinity for cytochrome b5 is only retained on d-b5 columns. Cytochrome-P-450 reductase is not retained on either column. Because affinity chromatography is suggested on d-b5 columns, the procedure may be generally applicable for predicting protein-protein interactions of microsomal electron transport components that either donate electrons to, or receive electrons from, cytochrome b5. In addition, the procedure should have considerable utilitarian application for enzyme enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W1490742876,"Abstract It was reported earlier that the biosynthesis of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (U1, U2, U3, U4, and U5) shows an unexpected great sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (254 nm). In this inhibition, snRNA formation is suppressed immediately after exposure to UV light. There is also a second inhibition of snRNA biosynthesis which requires lower doses of UV radiation and 1-2 h of postirradiation cell incubation to develop fully. In the present work we asked which step, within the metabolic pathway leading to the accumulation of newly made snRNA, is affected by UV light. Both for the early and late UV radiation-induced inhibitions: (a) similar results were obtained after pulse labeling or pulse chasing the radiolabel, implying that UV light did not decrease the stability of newly made snRNA; and (b) gel electrophoretic analysis of radiolabeled RNA that had been hybrid selected with cloned snRNA genes showed no accumulation of putative snRNA precursors, suggesting that UV radiation did not block snRNA processing. Instead, when transcription was carried out in isolated nuclei from irradiated cells, the effects of and inhibition were reproduced, indicating that transcription was affected. The early suppression appears to be a separate reaction from the late inhibition, since U1 snRNA transcription in isolated nuclei was inhibited in the absence of postirradiation cell incubation. There is a small fraction of snRNA synthesis that is resistant to high UV light doses (greater than or equal to 870 J/m2) right after irradiation, but is sensitive to lower doses (less than or equal to 36 J/m2) when the cells are incubated for 2 h after irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1589420263,"During the deamination of S-2-aminopropanol by the AdoCbl-dependent ethanolamine ammonia-lyase of Clostridia sp., a catalytic intermediate accumulates whose active site contains two paramagnetic species: cob(II)alamin and a free radical derived from the substrate molecule. Spin-echo spectroscopy has revealed that the unpaired electron on the substrate-derived radical is delocalized over a nitrogen atom that from its quadrupole splittings is probably a component of a secondary amide group. Experiments with 15N- and deuterium-labeled propanolamine gave no evidence of an interaction between this unpaired electron and the nitrogen originally attached to the substrate molecule. These results strongly suggest that the substrate-derived radical in this intermediate has already lost its nitrogen, and that this radical is stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron onto a nitrogen most likely situated in one of the peptide bonds of the enzyme backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1593801243,"We have found that in vitro lipolysis of human very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LpL) promotes degradation of the apolipoprotein (apo) B moiety of VLDL. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis showed that lipolysis of VLDL by purified LpL for 1 h at 37 degrees C induced the selective degradation of the high Mr apo-B (apo-B-100) from most hypertriglyceridemic VLDL and from a few normolipidemic VLDL into several small fragments with molecular weights ranging from 90,000-490,000. No detectable degradation of apo-B occurred in control VLDL when incubated without LpL. The apo-E moiety of VLDL from certain individuals was also degraded following lipolysis of VLDL, and the extent of degradation of apo-B and -E in VLDL was varied among the individual VLDL. The major degradation products of apo-E, identified from the gel, were 31,000- and/or 28,000-Da species. In contrast to the apo-E moiety of VLDL, purified apo-E was not degraded when incubated with LpL. Incubation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) with LpL showed only a minimal effect on the apoproteins of LDL. When high density lipoprotein (HDL) was included in the lipolysis mixture as an acceptor of lipolytic surface remnants, the apoproteins of HDL remained unaltered, while the apo-B moiety of VLDL remnants in the mixture was degraded. Inclusion of protease inhibitors in the lipolysis mixture prevented the degradation of apo-B, but the hydrolysis of VLDL-triglyceride was minimally affected. A selective degradation of apo-B in VLDL also occurred during lipolysis of VLDL when VLDL was perfused through rat hearts. These results suggest that conformational changes in apo-B and apo-E caused by VLDL lipolysis may increase the susceptibility of apo-B and apo-E to degradation by the proteases co-isolated with VLDL. The consequences of the lipolysis-induced degradation of apo-B and apo-E on changes in metabolic properties of VLDL remnants remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1491120591,"[3H]Myristoyl-labeled variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) has been isolated from Trypanosoma brucei by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and used as substrate for the conversion by trypanosomal enzymes of membrane-form VSG to soluble VSG. Conversion is detected by the release of myristoyl-containing lipids. The major lipolytic enzyme of T. brucei, phospholipase A1, is effective for the hydrolysis of myristoyl esters of p-nitrophenol, in a colorimetric assay. However, the phospholipase is unable to cleave the myristoyl ester linkage of VSG. The phospholipase can be separated from the myristoyl-releasing activity of trypanosome homogenate by centrifugation, affinity chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography. Elution profiles on anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography also indicate that the phospholipase is inactive against VSG. A small amount of myristoyl-releasing activity associated with the purified phospholipase is probably due to contamination with a phosphodiesterase which releases myristoyl-containing diglyceride from VSG."
https://openalex.org/W1492051166,"Abstract Male rat liver microsomes oxidized androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol (delta 16-ANDO) to delta 16-ANDO-5,6 alpha-, -5,6 beta-, -16,17 alpha-, and -16,17 beta-epoxides and delta 16-ANDO-5 alpha,6 beta-, -16 alpha,17 beta-, and -16 beta,17 alpha-glycols in the presence of an NADPH-generating system and the microsomal lipid peroxidation accelerator, Fe2+-ADP. The hepatic microsomes hydrolyzed all the delta 16-ANDO epoxides to the glycols. delta 16-ANDO-5 alpha,6 beta-glycol was the sole metabolite from both 5,6 alpha- and 5,6 beta-epoxides. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase also hydrolyzed delta 16-ANDO-16,17 alpha-epoxide specifically to the 16 beta,17 alpha-glycol and the isomeric 16,17 beta-epoxide to the 16 alpha,17 beta- and 16 beta,17 alpha-glycols approximately in the equal ratio. The delta 5-epoxidation of delta 16-ANDO by microsomes occurred only under the conditions that lipid peroxidation took place. Direct evidence was obtained for the participation of microsomal lipid hydroperoxides in the epoxidation of delta 16-ANDO by using photochemically prepared hydroperoxides of phospholipids separated from the hepatic microsomes. The hydroperoxides generated active oxygens, tentatively assigned as alk(ylper)oxy radicals, by the action of ferrous ion and epoxidized delta 16-ANDO to afford the 5,6- and 16,17-epoxides. The Fe2+-ADP-mediated epoxidation of delta 16-ANDO by the phospholipid hydroperoxides occurred preferentially at delta 5 to delta 16 and afforded the 5,6 beta-epoxide in a higher ratio than the 5,6 alpha-epoxide, similar to the Fe2+-ADP-mediated microsomal epoxidation, while the alpha-epoxide was preferentially formed to the beta-epoxide for delta 16 in the epoxidation by both systems."
