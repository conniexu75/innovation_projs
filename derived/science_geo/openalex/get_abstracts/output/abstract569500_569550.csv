This synthetic biology platform resolves important practical limitations in the production and distribution of therapeutics and molecular tools, both to the developed and developing world. Synthetic biology applies rational design principles of engineering to molecular biology to build genetic devices, which have begun to impact the diagnostic and therapeutic space. This approach has helped to create whole-cell biosensors (Kobayashi et al., 2004Kobayashi H. Kaern M. Araki M. Chung K. Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Programmable cells: interfacing natural and engineered gene networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Med. 2015; 7: 289ra84Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and a growing capability for cell-based biomolecular manufacturing. Rooted in genetically engineered production cell lines, biosynthesis is increasingly a mainstay for industrial drug production (Fossati et al., 2014Fossati E. Ekins A. Narcross L. Zhu Y.

Synthetic and systems biology for microbial production of commodity chemicals.Npj Syst. Biol. Appl. 2016; 2: 16009Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the reliance on living cellular hosts to operate the genetic programs that underpin biosynthesis is accompanied by biosafety regulations, practical hurdles, and specialized skills that limit their operation to laboratory settings. Therefore, vaccines and other protein-based biomolecules must be globally distributed from centralized foundries and, most often, require a cold chain for stability. These limitations impact distribution costs and highlight the challenge of delivering the benefits of these technologies to developing regions. We recently reported a method for the safe deployment of genetically encoded tools (Pardee et al., 2014Pardee K. Green A.A. Ferrante T. Cameron D.E. DaleyKeyser A. Yin P. Collins J.J. Paper-based synthetic gene networks.Cell. 2014; 159: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Using freeze-dried, cell-free (FD-CF) expression machinery on paper, we generated a platform that retains the fundamental protein synthesis capability of live cells while remaining abiotic, sterile, and portable. In combination with toehold switch RNA sensors (Green et al., 2014Green A.A. Silver P.A. Collins J.J. Yin P. Toehold switches: de-novo-designed regulators of gene expression.Cell. 2014; 159: 925-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), this platform was used to demonstrate a new class of low-cost diagnostic tools (Pardee et al., 2016Pardee K.

FD-CF reactions offer additional venues for the distributed use of synthetic biology apart from diagnostics, such as the exciting prospect of the portable manufacture of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic proteins, and other biomolecules. In recent years, in vitro biosynthesis from fresh or frozen lysates has developed remarkably, including the biomanufacture of difficult molecules that cause cell toxicity and the incorporation of non-canonical elements (Amiram et al., 2015Amiram M.

Building off of this foundation, the proposed use of FD-CF systems, with their long-term activity at room temperature (>1 year) and ease of operation, could alleviate both the restrictions of live-cell biosynthesis and cold-chain distribution requirements (Pardee et al., 2014Pardee K.

Paper-based synthetic gene networks.Cell. 2014; 159: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recent reports draw emphasis to a pressing need for the decentralization of therapeutic biomanufacturing, offering novel alternatives that, nonetheless, require expensive, large equipment and highly skilled operators or yet rely on production from living cells (Adamo et al., 2016Adamo A. Beingessner R.L. Behnam M. Chen J. Jamison T.F. Jensen K.F. Monbaliu J.-C.M. Myerson A.S. Revalor E.M.

Commun. 2016; 7: 12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated protein production from lyophilized reactions, which strongly supports the notion of advancing this concept further toward on-demand, local biomanufacturing (Salehi et al., 2016Salehi A.S.M. Smith M.T. Bennett A.M. Williams J.B. Pitt W.G. Bundy B.C. Cell-free protein synthesis of a cytotoxic cancer therapeutic: Onconase production and a just-add-water cell-free system.Biotechnol.

Lyophilized Escherichia coli-based cell-free systems for robust, high-density, long-term storage.Biotechniques. 2014; 56: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to portability, the FD-CF format has all of the advantages that are innate to in vitro biosynthesis. Moreover, with buffers, cellular machinery, and molecular instructions all compressed into a single FD reaction pellet, on-demand, on-site activation would only require the addition of water and yields product within 1–2 hr, without the need for specialized equipment and skill. This system could be applied for global health and personalized medicine, making scalable molecular synthesis available to anyone with FD reagents and DNA-encoding biosynthesis instructions. Here, we present a series of vignettes describing the production of a diverse set of therapeutics and molecular tools for clinical and research environments using FD-CF reaction pellets (Figure 1). Nested within this proof of concept is a drive to create inexpensive alternatives for developing world applications where cost is a major factor to access. We begin with the production of two therapeutic classes of molecules: antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and vaccines. For the former, we demonstrate purification schemes and validate antimicrobial activity. For the latter, we verify the expression of three vaccine antigens, including the scaled-up production and functional characterization of the diphtheria toxoid antigen (DT), which is administered to an animal model to confirm a successful immune response. Next, we establish a novel combinatorial approach to generate 90 possible affinity conjugates for applications in research and healthcare, of which a subset are functionally validated. Finally, we reconstitute a multi-enzyme biosynthesis pathway for small-molecular therapeutic production and offer a mix-and-match method to synthesize multiple pathway products, which are confirmed using mass spectrometry (MS). AMPs are a diverse peptide class that evolved as defense molecules against infection by interfering with protective cell layers and intracellular components. Given their wide target range (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and cancer) (Gaspar et al., 2013Gaspar D. Veiga A.S. Castanho M.A.R.B. From antimicrobial to anticancer peptides. A review.Front Microbiol. 2013; 4: 294Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), compact molecular structure (<10 kDa), and reports of their expression using non-lyophilized lysates (Lee et al., 2010Lee K.-H. Kwon Y.-C. Yoo S.J. Kim D.-M. Ribosomal synthesis and in situ isolation of peptide molecules in a cell-free translation system.Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 71: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Martemyanov et al., 2001Martemyanov K.A. Shirokov V.A. Kurnasov O.V. Gudkov A.T. Spirin A.S. Cell-free production of biologically active polypeptides: application to the synthesis of antibacterial peptide cecropin.Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we sought to express and functionally validate these promising alternatives to classic antibiotics using the FD-CF format. DNA templates encoding ten different AMPs (B1CTcu1, PEP3, CA(1-7)M(2-9), BP100, Magainin 2, Cecropin P1, Cecropin B, Bac7(1-35), Tachystatin A1, and Opistoporin 1) were added to a recombinant CF reaction mixture and lyophilized (Table S1). Following subsequent rehydration and incubation, electrophoresis and staining confirmed that all AMPs were produced (Figure 2A). To support applications in which background proteins might interfere, we also designed versions of three AMPs to contain a leader sequence for increased stability, an affinity tag for purification, and a Factor Xa protease site for subsequent removal of these added residues, which could dampen bioactivity. His6- and FLAG-tagged variants of each AMP were successfully synthesized and were confirmed by western blot (WB) (Figure 2B). Lyophilized, bacterial lysates prepared “in house” could serve as vastly more economical alternatives to commercial lysate-based kits or recombinant kits. Therefore, the expression of FLAG-tagged Cecropin P1 using lyophilized, in-house lysate was benchmarked against a S30 T7 lysate-based kit (Promega; L1110) and a recombinant system (NEB; E6800L). A semiquantitative WB confirmed successful AMP production from in-house lysate, which outperformed the S30 T7 kit and yielded 20%–40% of the amount produced with the recombinant system (Figure S1A). Next, affinity purification and Factor Xa cleavage were demonstrated, resulting in the release of a peptide product of expected size (Figure 2C). Cleavage was alternatively performed in a crude AMP reaction (Figure S1B). The small AMP size offers an alternative, simple purification route based on molecular weight filtration (Figure 2D). Accordingly, AMP synthesis reactions were passed through a 10 kDa filter, which resulted in the retention of CF machinery while allowing passage and recovery of the AMPs (Figure 2D). Using custom-synthesized AMP standards (LifeTein), semiquantitative analysis was applied to a subset of weight-filtered AMP reactions for Cecropin P1, Cecropin B, CA(1-7)M(2-9), and BP100. Yields of soluble peptide were approximated at 125–156 ng/μL, 188–219 ng/μL, 94–125 ng/μL, and 63–94 ng/μL, respectively (Figure S1C). Finally, AMP bioactivity was tested and exhibited a growth inhibition effect on either E. coli (Gram-negative) or B. subtilis (Gram-positive) (Figures 2E and 2F, respectively, and Figures S1D and S1E, respectively). Importantly, isolation of the AMPs from the CF machinery was not required for bioactivity, highlighting an added flexibility that suggests that, in appropriate cases, such as for topical administration, AMPs could be rapidly synthesized and applied effectively in crude format. Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in disease prevention, with childhood diseases, such as polio, smallpox, and diphtheria, largely contained owing to systematic immunizations. However, distribution to the developing world is challenging, primarily due to costs and cold-chain requirements. While some vaccines can be lyophilized, temperature-controlled distribution cannot be avoided for others. Citing previous reports of the in vitro expression of vaccine antigens (Palmenberg, 1982Palmenberg A.C. In vitro synthesis and assembly of picornaviral capsid intermediate structures.J. Virol. 1982; 44: 900-906PubMed Google Scholar, Welsh et al., 2012Welsh J.P. Lu Y. He X.-S. Greenberg H.B. Swartz J.R.

Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we sought to explore whether biosynthesis could be performed on site using FD-CF reactions, rather than restricted to a centralized production facility (Figure 3A). We began with the expression of vaccine antigens for botulinum (neurotoxin fragment, HcE) (Zichel et al., 2010Zichel R. Mimran A. Keren A. Barnea A. Steinberger-Levy I. Marcus D. Turgeman A. Reuveny S. Efficacy of a potential trivalent vaccine based on Hc fragments of botulinum toxins A, B, and E produced in a cell-free expression system.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 784-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), anthrax (protective antigen, PA), and diphtheria (Diphtheria toxoid, DT), which resulted in clear bands of the expected molecular weights (Figure 3B). Diphtheria infections can lead to severe symptoms, including death. It remains endemic in developing countries that represent 80%–90% of global cases (Dandinarasaiah et al., 2013Dandinarasaiah M. Vikram B.K. Krishnamurthy N. Chetan A.C. Jain A. Diphtheria Re-emergence: Problems Faced by Developing Countries.Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2013; 65: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The DT antigen was chosen for further characterization, as it is sensitive to both heat and freezing, designating it as an especially challenging vaccine for global distribution (WHO, 2014aWHO (2014a). Temperature Sensitivity of Vaccines; http://www.who.int/immunization/programmes_systems/supply_chain/resources/VaccineStability_EN.pdf. Accessed August 2016.Google Scholar). Fresh, recombinant CF reagents were used to test the expression levels of different DT toxoid antigens (Collier, 2006Collier, R.J. (2006). Multi-mutant diphtheria toxin vaccines. US Patent 7115725 B2.Google Scholar, Giannini et al., 1984Giannini G. Rappuoli R. Ratti G.

Among those tested, the 51E/148K variant (DT5) and 52E variant (DT6), both containing an N-terminal leader and FLAG-tag, displayed the highest expression levels (Figure S2A and Table S1). Next, the DT5 and DT6 antigens were successfully produced using lyophilized, recombinant reagents, and yield was measured via quantitative fluorescent western blotting (QFWB), which revealed 768 ng/μL (DT5) and 1341 ng/μL (DT6) of soluble protein (Figures S2B and S2C). Correct protein folding, critical for the induction of antibody (Ab)-based immunity, was evaluated via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both antigens successfully bound to commercial anti-DT Abs, indicating correct protein conformation (Figure 3C). Similar to AMP expression using lyophilized lysates prepared in house, we tested whether DT5 could be produced from this inexpensive source. First, multiple combinations of Mg-glutamate (Mg-Glu) and K-glutamate (K-Glu) concentrations were applied to fresh, in-house lysate to determine optimal expression conditions for DT5, showing 6 mM Mg-Glu + 110 mM K-Glu as ideal concentrations (Figure S2D). DT5 was then produced from FD, in-house lysate under these conditions and was compared to a sample produced from a lyophilized, commercial S30 T7 lysate, resulting in comparable expression levels (Figure S2E). To test methods that might increase DT5 levels, FD-CF reactions were supplemented with a disulfide bond enhancer (DSE), which resulted in a marked increase in band intensity (Figure S2F). The addition of DSE, which can be generated in house or purchased, improves yield by ensuring proper disulfide bridge formation (Goerke and Swartz, 2008Goerke A.R. Swartz J.R. Development of cell-free protein synthesis platforms for disulfide bonded proteins.Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008; 99: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Toward a similar agenda, DT6 levels were assessed after applying a dialysis membrane to the hydrated reaction, providing the CF expression machinery access to a reservoir of molecular reagents while restricting the components to the original, small volume (Noireaux and Libchaber, 2004Noireaux V.

A continuous cell-free translation system capable of producing polypeptides in high yield.Science. 1988; 242: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This approach also led to increased yield when compared to a non-dialyzed reaction (Figure S2G). The final stage focused on confirming the induction of anti-DT IgG Ab expression in an animal model. First, DT5 was produced from a FD-CF reaction pellet (originating from 900 μl of recombinant, CF reagent) and was isolated via its FLAG tag (Figures 3D and S2H). Next, endotoxin levels were evaluated using the industry standard limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and showed an extremely low level of endotoxin (596 EU/mL), referencing guidelines for toxoid-based vaccines (<200,000 EU/mL) (Figure 3E) (Brito and Singh, 2011Brito L.A. Singh M. Acceptable levels of endotoxin in vaccine formulations during preclinical research.J. Pharm. Sci. 2011; 100: 34-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). DT5 was injected into mice (2.5 μg per mouse per injection) at three time points (days 0, 7, and 14), and blood was drawn (days 0, 21, 28, and 42) to test for Ab production. Accompanying the test group were two control groups: non-injected mice and mice injected with the products of a DNA null control (consisting of a FD-CF reaction lacking DT5-encoding plasmid, which underwent identical expression, purification, and injection steps compared to the DT5 test sample). No mice exhibited signs of ill effect from injections throughout the experiment. Crucially, a strong induction of anti-DT IgG Ab production in DT5-treated mice was detected beginning at 3 weeks after the first injection (quantified via ELISA), and no induction was observed in either control group (Figure 3F). Ab-based tools, such as ELISA, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and immunofluorescence imaging, have long been used as target-specific reagents in research and clinical applications. Abs have recently begun to revolutionize therapeutics by enabling targeted treatment of diseases, including cancer (Scott et al., 2012Scott A.M. Wolchok J.D. Old L.J. Antibody therapy of cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), immune disorders (Wang et al., 2015Wang R.E. Liu T. Wang Y. Cao Y. Du J. Luo X. Deshmukh V. Kim C.H. Lawson B.R.

Dual targeting strategies with bispecific antibodies.MAbs. 2012; 4: 182-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), as well as targeted delivery of antibiotics (Lehar et al., 2015Lehar S.M.

Morisaki J.H. et al.Novel antibody-antibiotic conjugate eliminates intracellular S. aureus.Nature. 2015; 527: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Abs have been expressed using laboratory-based CF systems; however, their structural complexity, disulphide bonds, and post-translational modification requirements make their production challenging (Patel et al., 2011Patel K.G. Ng P.P. Levy S. Levy R. Swartz J.R. Escherichia coli-based production of a tumor idiotype antibody fragment--tetanus toxin fragment C fusion protein vaccine for B cell lymphoma.Protein Expr.

Functional antibody production using cell-free translation: effects of protein disulfide isomerase and chaperones.Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Directed evolution and other engineering techniques have expanded the repertoire of such tools, creating designer affinity molecules, including DARPins and Nanobodies, which are artificial ankyrin repeat proteins and single-chain camelid immunoglobulin fragments, respectively (Desmyter et al., 2015Desmyter A.

Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins): binding proteins for research, diagnostics, and therapy.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2015; 55: 489-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Such designer affinity molecules are under development as potential therapeutics, such as Abicipar (anti-VEGF DARPin) and Ozoralizumab (anti-TNFα Nanobody). While Abs and their analogs are powerful tools, their high production cost and need for cold storage limit their distribution and utility. Accordingly, we focused on the FD-CF biosynthesis of DARPin- and Nanobody-based affinity molecules (Doshi et al., 2014Doshi R. Chen B.R. Vibat C.R.T. Huang N. Lee C.-W. Chang G. In vitro nanobody discovery for integral membrane protein targets.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4: 6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Plückthun, 2015Plückthun A. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins): binding proteins for research, diagnostics, and therapy.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2015; 55: 489-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). We designed templates encoding DARPins and Nanobodies specific to 15 diverse molecular targets: fluorophores (GFP, mCherry), cancer-specific epitopes (CEA5, GLUT-1, HER2, epCAM), a cell marker (Vimentin), a cytokine (VEGF-A), a cell-specific epitope (glycophorin A), parasite antigens (VAR2CSA), virus epitopes (dengue, HIV, norovirus, rotavirus), and a C. difficile exotoxin (TcdA) (Table S1). Each sequence was appended with a “SpyTag” and FLAG-tag. Engineered as a split protein from the Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein, the SpyTag forms a spontaneous covalent bond with the “SpyCatcher” protein fragment (Zakeri et al., 2012Zakeri B. Fierer J.O. Celik E. Chittock E.C. Schwarz-Linek U. Moy V.T. Howarth M. Peptide tag forming a rapid covalent bond to a protein, through engineering a bacterial adhesin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E690-E697Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Here, a sequence encoding the SpyCatcher was added to a series of output domains: yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), α-amylase, E. coli alkaline-phosphatase (PhoAP), S. ana-3 alkaline-phosphatase (SanaAP), P. aeruginosa exotoxin, and C. diptheriae exotoxin. By incorporating the SpyTag-SpyCatcher scheme into a modular series of affinity proteins and output domains expressed separately, we envisioned a means to generate user-defined de novo protein fusions (Figure 4A). This portable, combinatorial toolbox would allow end users to link a Nanobody or DARPin of choice to a desired output function, such as fluorescence, enzymatic activity, or targeted toxicity, with potentially 90 unique combinations. Anti-FLAG WBs verified the expression of all 15 affinity proteins in FD-CF reactions (Figure 4B). To calibrate Nanobody production using FD-CF, recombinant material, we tested the expression levels of soluble NbTcdA and NbCEA5 using QFWB and measured a yield of 66.4 μg/mL and 280 μg/mL, respectively (Figures S2B and S2C). The FD-CF biosynthesis of all SpyCatcher functional domains was confirmed via Coomassie staining (Figure 4C).

Manually segmenting muscle and fat compartments in MR body-images is laborious and time-consuming, hindering implementation in large cohorts. In the present study, the feasibility and success-rate of a Dixon-based MR scan followed by an intensity-normalised, non-rigid, multi-atlas based segmentation was investigated in a cohort of 3,000 subjects.3,000 participants in the in-depth phenotyping arm of the UK Biobank imaging study underwent a comprehensive MR examination. All subjects were scanned using a 1.5 T MR-scanner with the dual-echo Dixon Vibe protocol, covering neck to knees. Subjects were scanned with six slabs in supine position, without localizer. Automated body composition analysis was performed using the AMRA Profiler™ system, to segment and quantify visceral adipose tissue (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT) and thigh muscles. Technical quality assurance was performed and a standard set of acceptance/rejection criteria was established. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all volume measurements and quality assurance metrics.Of the 3,000 subjects, 2,995 (99.83%) were analysable for body fat, 2,828 (94.27%) were analysable when body fat and one thigh was included, and 2,775 (92.50%) were fully analysable for body fat and both thigh muscles. Reasons for not being able to analyse datasets were mainly due to missing slabs in the acquisition, or patient positioned so that large parts of the volume was outside of the field-of-view.In conclusion, this study showed that the rapid UK Biobank MR-protocol was well tolerated by most subjects and sufficiently robust to achieve very high success-rate for body composition analysis. This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource."

To identify improved mouse models for breast cancer growth and spontaneous metastasis, we examined growth and metastasis of both estrogen receptor positive (T47D) and negative (MDA-MB-231, SUM1315, and CN34BrM) human breast cancer cells in nude and NSG mice. Both primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastases were increased in NSG mice compared to nude mice. In addition, a pattern of metastasis similar to that observed in human breast cancer patients (metastases to the lungs, liver, bones, brain, and lymph nodes) was found in NSG mice. Furthermore, there was an increase in the metastatic burden in NSG compared to nude mice that were injected with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in an intracardiac experimental metastasis model. This data demonstrates that NSG mice provide a better model for studying human breast cancer metastasis compared to the current nude mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2522836737,"Cardiomyopathies represent a rare group of disorders often of genetic origin. While approximately 50% of genetic causes are known for other types of cardiomyopathies, the genetic spectrum of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify the genetic background of idiopathic RCM and to compile the obtained genetic variants to the novel signalling pathways using in silico protein network analysis.We used Illumina MiSeq setup to screen for 108 cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia-associated genes in 24 patients with idiopathic RCM. Pathogenicity of genetic variants was classified according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification.Pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants were detected in 13 of 24 patients resulting in an overall genotype-positive rate of 54%. Half of the genotype-positive patients carried a combination of pathogenic, likely-pathogenic variants and variants of unknown significance. The most frequent combination included mutations in sarcomeric and cytoskeletal genes (38%). A bioinformatics approach underlined the mechanotransducing protein networks important for RCM pathogenesis.Multiple gene mutations were detected in half of the RCM cases, with a combination of sarcomeric and cytoskeletal gene mutations being the most common. Mutations of genes encoding sarcomeric, cytoskeletal, and Z-line-associated proteins appear to have a predominant role in the development of RCM."
https://openalex.org/W2521480612,"Sperm are allogenic to the female genital tract; however, oviducts provide optimal conditions for survival and capacitation of these non-self cells until fertilization. Recently, we showed that oviduct-conditioned media and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) suppress sperm phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) under physiological conditions. We hypothesized that sperm binding to bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOECs) could change the local innate immunity via PGE2. As the first step to obtain basic information, sub-confluent BOEC monolayers were co-cultured with swim-up sperm for 2 h. BOECs with viable bound sperm were cultured for an additional 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. Then, we confirmed the impact of the sperm-BOEC binding on both BOECs and PMN gene expression. Immunohistochemistry revealed that BOECs strongly express TGFB1 and IL10 in the oviduct. Sperm binding to BOECs in culture induced the anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGFB1 and IL10) and PGE2 production by BOECs. Exogenous PGE2 in vitro suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF and IL1B) in BOECs. Moreover, pre-exposure of PMNs to BOEC-conditioned media suppressed the TNF expression, but the BOEC media co-cultured with sperm stimulated PMNs to express TGFB1 and IL10, with increasing PGE2 secretion. Of note, exogenous PGE2 led PMNs in vitro to decrease their TNF expression and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines expression. Our findings strongly suggest that BOECs provide an anti-inflammatory environment under physiological conditions and the sperm-BOEC binding further strengthens this milieu thus suppresses PMNs in the bovine oviduct. PGE2 is likely to drive this stable anti-inflammatory environment in the oviduct."

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is not only an essential physiological process, but also a key feature of a number of pathological processes (Folkman and Klagsbrun, 1987Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Angiogenic factors.Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4037) Google Scholar). Several families of mediators of angiogenesis have been described (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Molecular mechanisms and clinical applications of angiogenesis.Nature. 2011; 473: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3722) Google Scholar, Kerbel, 2008Kerbel R.S. Tumor angiogenesis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 2039-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar), but it is now well established that VEGF-A is an essential regulator of this process (Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target.Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The binding of VEGF-A to its major tyrosine kinase receptor, VEGFR2, stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells via the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway (Herbert and Stainier, 2011Herbert S.P.

The critical role of the VEGF pathway is supported by genetic studies showing that the embryos of vegfa+/− mice (Carmeliet et al., 1996Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L.

Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Failure of blood-island formation and vasculogenesis in Flk-1-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar) mice have major defects in the development of the vasculature, resulting in embryonic lethality. In addition, the VEGF signaling pathway represents a validated therapeutic target for cancer and intraocular neovascular disorders (Ferrara and Adamis, 2016Ferrara N. Adamis A.P. Ten years of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2016; 15: 385-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005Ferrara N. Kerbel R.S. Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target.Nature. 2005; 438: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Multiple isoforms of VEGF-A exist. Alternative splicing of exons 6 and 7 of the VEGF gene gives rise to VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, the originally described isoforms (reviewed in Ferrara et al., 2003Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. The biology of VEGF and its receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Subsequently, less common isoforms have been reported, including VEGF145 and VEGF183 (Ferrara, 2004Ferrara N. Vascular endothelial growth factor: basic science and clinical progress.Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar, Neufeld et al., 1999Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors.FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). A major difference among these isoforms is the affinity for heparin. VEGF189 and VEGF206 each have two heparin-binding domains encoded by exon 6 and 7, while VEGF165 has only the exon-7-encoded heparin-binding domain (Ferrara et al., 2003Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. The biology of VEGF and its receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). VEGF121 is devoid of significant heparin affinity (Ferrara et al., 2003Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. The biology of VEGF and its receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). VEGF165 is the most frequently expressed isoform in normal tissues and in tumors (Ferrara, 2004Ferrara N. Vascular endothelial growth factor: basic science and clinical progress.Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar, Neufeld et al., 1999Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors.FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) and has an intermediary behavior between that of the highly diffusible VEGF121 and the strongly extracellular matrix (ECM)-bound VEGF189. Interaction of the heparin-binding VEGF isoforms with the co-receptor Neuropilin (NRP)-1 increases their binding affinity for VEGFR-2 and potentiates the effectiveness of signal transduction (Soker et al., 1998Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Neuropilin-1 is expressed by endothelial and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor.Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Also, the COOH terminus of VEGF165 has cleavage sites for plasmin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (Ferrara, 2010Ferrara N. Binding to the extracellular matrix and proteolytic processing: two key mechanisms regulating vascular endothelial growth factor action.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These ubiquitous proteases can generate diffusible and bioactive VEGF-A fragments (Houck et al., 1992Houck K.A. Leung D.W.

Indeed, much evidence supports important roles for such proteolytic products of VEGF during angiogenesis (Ferrara, 2010Ferrara N. Binding to the extracellular matrix and proteolytic processing: two key mechanisms regulating vascular endothelial growth factor action.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Over the last several years, inhibitory VEGF-A isoforms have also been reported. The first was VEGF165b (Bates et al., 2002Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. VEGF165b, an inhibitory splice variant of vascular endothelial growth factor, is down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar), a variant with an alternative 6-amino-acid end, resulting from splicing from the end of exon 7 into the 3′ untranslated region, thus replacing the sequences encoded by exon 8 (Bates et al., 2002Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J. VEGF165b, an inhibitory splice variant of vascular endothelial growth factor, is down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4123-4131PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule was reported to inhibit VEGF165 activity in multiple contexts (Bates et al., 2002Bates D.O. Cui T.G. Doughty J.M. Winkler M. Sugiono M. Shields J.D. Peat D. Gillatt D. Harper S.J.

Craze M. Newton J. Fisher M. Shima D.T. Tozer G.M. Kanthou C. Do anti-angiogenic VEGF (VEGFxxxb) isoforms exist? A cautionary tale.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e35231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, VEGF-Ax has been described as a novel inhibitory isoform that arises from an entirely different mechanism, programmed readthrough translation (Eswarappa et al., 2014Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A. Koch W.J. Fan Y. Vasu K. Lindner D. Willard B. Graham L.M. DiCorleto P.E. Fox P.L. Programmed translational readthrough generates antiangiogenic VEGF-Ax.Cell. 2014; 157: 1605-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Compared to VEGF165, VEGF-Ax has a 22-amino-acid extension in the carboxyl (COOH) terminus. VEGF-Ax has been reported to have potent anti-angiogenic effects and to function as a negative regulator of VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. However, no clear mechanism for these inhibitory functions was elucidated (Eswarappa et al., 2014Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A. Koch W.J. Fan Y. Vasu K. Lindner D. Willard B. Graham L.M. DiCorleto P.E. Fox P.L. Programmed translational readthrough generates antiangiogenic VEGF-Ax.Cell. 2014; 157: 1605-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Given the potential importance of these findings, we cloned and expressed recombinant VEGF-Ax, with the aim of deciphering the inhibitory signals emanating from the C-terminal domain unique to VEGF-Ax. To investigate the effects of VEGF-Ax on endothelial cells, a DNA-fragment-encoding bovine (b) VEGF-A164 with a COOH-terminal extension (Eswarappa et al., 2014Eswarappa S.M. Potdar A.A. Koch W.J. Fan Y. Vasu K. Lindner D. Willard B. Graham L.M. DiCorleto P.E. Fox P.L. Programmed translational readthrough generates antiangiogenic VEGF-Ax.Cell. 2014; 157: 1605-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was synthetized and inserted into the vectors, generating VEGF-Ax expression plasmids as described in STAR Methods. Figure 1A illustrates the sequences of the insert. The 22-amino-acid C-terminal extension is boxed and highlighted, and a blue S indicated the canonical stop codon tga replaced by tcc (serine). The presence of untagged or His-tagged (COOH terminus) VEGF-Ax in the conditioned media of transfected 293T cells was confirmed by western blot (Figure 1B). We then tested the effects of the conditioned media on endothelial cell proliferation. As shown in Figure 1C, conditioned media from cells transiently expressing untagged or His-tagged VEGF-Ax unexpectedly resulted in robust, dilution-dependent stimulation of bovine choroidal endothelial cell (BCEC) proliferation (p < 0.001). Conditioned media from empty vector transfected cells had comparably little mitogenic activity. No evidence of inhibition was observed in multiple assays of independent transfections. We performed most of our analyses with the untagged protein, being arguably more physiologically relevant than the His-tagged protein since it is expected to be identical to the native protein. To purify untagged VEGF-Ax from 293T-cells-conditioned media, we performed affinity chromatography using a column coupled with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb) B.20.4.1 (Liang et al., 2006Liang W.C. Wu X. Peale F.V. Lee C.V. Meng Y.G. Gutierrez J. Fu L. Malik A.K. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. et al.Cross-species vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-blocking antibodies completely inhibit the growth of human tumor xenografts and measure the contribution of stromal VEGF.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This mAb binds VEGF-A across species, and its binding epitope in VEGF-A closely corresponds to the receptor-binding epitope (Fuh et al., 2006Fuh G. Wu P. Liang W.C. Ultsch M. Lee C.V. Moffat B. Wiesmann C. Structure-function studies of two synthetic anti-vascular endothelial growth factor Fabs and comparison with the Avastin Fab.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6625-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, mAb B.20.4.1 should provide an unbiased capture of functional molecular forms of VEGF-Ax in the medium. As shown in Figure 2A, this method achieved purification to near homogeneity, as assessed by silver-stained gel. We detected, in the peak fractions, a major band of approximately 25 kDa in reducing conditions, consistent with the full-length VEGF-Ax monomer. This band accounted for ∼90% of the proteins by densitometry. A doublet of ∼18–20 kDa was also detectable. As shown in Figure 2A, total VEGF concentrations as determined by ELISA were strongly correlated with the intensity of the bands in the gel. We made five independent preparations of untagged VEGF-Ax, with very similar results. For purification of His-VEGF-Ax, His-TrapR (Ni-Sepharose) columns were used and three independent purifications were performed. The recovery of purified His-VEGF-Ax, as assessed by ELISA, was comparable with that of the anti-VEGF antibody affinity column (data not shown). It is noteworthy that only His-VEGF-Ax with an intact C terminus can bind the His-Trap column, while cleaved forms devoid of His-tag would not be retained. We performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to structurally characterize the purified untagged VEGF-Ax proteins. The above mentioned higher and lower molecular mass bands were cut and submitted for analysis. As shown in Figure 2B, several peptide sequences (up to 67 amino acids) were identified in both samples with over 95% confidence, and all of those peptide sequences matched the sequence of bVEGF-A164 (Leung et al., 1989Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Vascular endothelial growth factor is a secreted angiogenic mitogen.Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4440) Google Scholar). A partial amino-acid sequence of the C-terminal extension “SAGLEEGASL” was detected with over 95% confidence in the 25 kDa sample digested by trypsin. GluC digestion yielded another partial sequence of the C-terminal extension “GASLRVSGTRRLTRKD” with over 95% confidence, showing overlap in “GASL.” Therefore, the entire sequence of the 22-amino-acid extension unique to VEGF-Ax was unambiguously detected in the major protein band using this two-enzyme digestion strategy. The lower band sample was consistent with C-terminal proteolytic products of VEGF-Ax lacking the 22-amino-acid extension. We tested purified VEGF-Ax in endothelial cell mitogenic assays. BCECs and BRECs (bovine retinal endothelial cells) were cultured in the presence of different concentrations of VEGF-Ax, with or without VEGF165. Untagged VEGF-Ax significantly (p < 0.001) induced proliferation of both BCECs (Figure 3A) and BRECs (Figure 3B) in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of the stimulation was 50%–70% of that obtained with VEGF165. Similarly, His-tagged VEGF-Ax significantly (p < 0.001) induced BCEC proliferation (Figure 3C). As shown in Figure S1 (related to Figure 3), untagged and His-tagged VEGF-Ax had a very similar ability to stimulate phosphorylation in VEGFR2 Y1175 and ERK1/2 activation. Importantly, no inhibition of VEGF165-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation was observed in the presence of untagged or His-tagged VEGF-Ax. To test the specificity of the effects of VEGF-Ax, we used mAb B20.4.1. Addition of mAb B20.4.1 almost completely (p < 0.001) inhibited VEGF-Ax- or VEGF165-induced BCEC proliferation. In contrast, a control immunoglobulin G (IgG) had no effect on BCEC proliferation stimulated by VEGF-Ax or VEGF165 (Figure 3D). To determine VEGF-A release from bovine endothelial cells, we measured total VEGF-A by ELISA in the cell culture media collected at various time points (Figure 3E). We found that the amounts of VEGF-A were very low; the highest concentration was 25 pg/mL in BAECs (bovine aortic endothelial cells) and BCECs, and it was almost undetectable in BRECs.Figure S1Activation of VEGFR2 Signaling, Related to Figure 3Show full captionActivation of VEGFR2 signaling.

Equal amounts of whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then blotted by the indicated antibodies. Migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was also assessed. As shown in Figure 4A, the number of migrated cells significantly (p < 0.01) increased in the presence of VEGF-Ax or VEGF165. In this assay, the magnitude of the effect of the two ligands was comparable. No inhibition of VEGF165-induced endothelial cell migration was observed when VEGF-Ax and VEGF165 were combined. To further confirm the effects of VEGF-Ax on endothelial cell proliferation and migration, BCEC monolayers were mechanically wounded. As shown in Figure 4B, in the presence of VEGF165, VEGF-Ax, or both, cell proliferation and migration toward the gap between the wound edges were evident, resulting in a significantly narrower gap compared to the control group. There was no evidence that VEGF-Ax antagonized the activity of VEGF165. Explanted mouse choroidal tissue provides a model for studying microvascular proliferation (Shao et al., 2013Shao Z. Friedlander M. Hurst C.G. Cui Z. Pei D.T. Evans L.P. Juan A.M. Tahiri H. Duhamel F. Chen J. et al.Choroid sprouting assay: an ex vivo model of microvascular angiogenesis.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e69552Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We used this assay to evaluate the pro-angiogenic effect of VEGF165, VEGF-Ax, and these molecules in combination. In pilot experiments, we tested various concentrations of VEGF165 and identified 25 ng as a concentration that strongly stimulates vessel sprouting relative to buffer control. When compared to 25 ng of VEGF-Ax, an equivalent amount of vessel proliferation over the same time period was observed. No difference in the density or extent of vessel proliferation was identified (Figure 5A). Furthermore, increasing the concentrations of VEGF-Ax or combining with lower concentration of VEGF165 did not induce further stimulation (or inhibition) of vessel proliferation. These data suggest very similar effects of VEGF165 and VEGF-Ax on choroidal explant vascular proliferation. One of the known activities of VEGF is the rapid induction of vascular permeability from an intact endothelium (Senger et al., 1983Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M. Perruzzi C.A. Harvey V.S. Dvorak H.F. Tumor cells secrete a vascular permeability factor that promotes accumulation of ascites fluid.Science. 1983; 219: 983-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of VEGF-Ax to induce vascular permeability in the Miles assay. As shown in Figure 5B, VEGF-Ax induced dye extravasation in a dose-dependent manner compared to PBS control (dose 0). VEGF165, as expected, strongly induced dye leakage. Administration of 50 ng of VEGF165 combined with different doses of VEGF-Ax (25–250ng) induced more dye extravasation compared to VEGF165 or VEGF-Ax treatment alone. After this work was essentially completed, human VEGF-Ax became available from R&D Systems. As shown in Figure 6, R&D Systems VEGF-Ax and our purified VEGF-Ax had comparable mitogenic effects on bovine endothelial cells and did not inhibit VEGF165-stimulated proliferation, even at a molar ratio of ∼10:1. We also tested, in the same assay, VEGF165b, which also stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and did not inhibit VEGF165-stimulated growth (Figure 6). Given the finding that VEGF-Ax has both mitogenic and permeabilizing effects, we examined the phosphorylation status of two key tyrosine residues in VEGFR2, Y1175 and Y951, which have been implicated, respectively, in the induction of endothelial cell proliferation (Sakurai et al., 2005Sakurai Y. Ohgimoto K. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shibuya M. Essential role of Flk-1 (VEGF receptor 2) tyrosine residue 1173 in vasculogenesis in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and of vascular permeability (Li et al., 2016Li X. Padhan N. Sjöström E.O. Roche F.P. Testini C. Honkura N. Sáinz-Jaspeado M. Gordon E. Bentley K. Philippides A. et al.VEGFR2 pY949 signalling regulates adherens junction integrity and metastatic spread.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11017Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 7A, VEGF-Ax purified in our laboratory or VEGF-Ax purchased from R&D Systems induced phosphorylation of both Y1175 and Y951 in VEGFR2. VEGF165b also induced phosphorylation of both tyrosine residues (Figure 7A). Since p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) is downstream of VEGFR2 activation, we also tested the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2. In agreement with the VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation data, VEGF-Ax, VEGF165, and, to a lesser extent, VEGF165b stimulated p-ERK1/2 (Figure 7A). Using an ELISA-based approach, we sought to determine whether VEGF-Ax is able to compete with biotinylated VEGF165 for NRP1 binding. Unlike VEGF165, neither VEGF121 nor VEGF-Ax significantly competed with biotinylated VEGF165 (Figure 7B). By alternative mRNA splicing, multiple VEGF-A isoforms are generated, including VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189. (Houck et al., 1991Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W.

https://openalex.org/W2522782410,"The idea that maladaptive stress impairs cognitive function has been a cornerstone of decades in basic and clinical research. However, disparate findings have reinforced the need to aggregate results from multiple sources in order to confirm the validity of such statement. In this work, a systematic review and meta-analyses were performed to aggregate results from rodent studies investigating the impact of chronic stress on learning and memory. Results obtained from the included studies revealed a significant effect of stress on global cognitive performance. In addition, stressed rodents presented worse consolidation of learned memories, although no significantly differences between groups at the acquisition phase were found. Despite the methodological heterogeneity across studies, these effects were independent of the type of stress, animals’ strains or age. However, our findings suggest that stress yields a more detrimental effect on spatial navigation tests’ performance. Surprisingly, the vast majority of the selected studies in this field did not report appropriate statistics and were excluded from the quantitative analysis. We have therefore purposed a set of guidelines termed PROBE (Preferred Reporting Orientations for Behavioral Experiments) to promote an adequate reporting of behavioral experiments."

Despite an excellent predictability of the Agatston score for cardiovascular events, the density of CAC has never been studied in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to analyze the CAC density and its association with serum mineral levels in CKD.We enrolled patients with pre-dialysis CKD who had diabetes mellitus, prior cardiovascular disease history, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, or smoking history. The average CAC density was calculated by dividing the Agatston score by the total area of CAC.The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 109 enrolled patients was 35.7 mL/min/1.73 m2. The correlation of the Agatston score with density was much weaker than that with the total area (R2 = 0.19, P < 0.001; and R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analyses showed that serum magnesium level was inversely associated with the density, but not with the total area, after adjustment for demographics and clinical factors related to malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis syndrome and mineral and bone disorders including fibroblast growth factor 23 (P = 0.006). This inverse association was pronounced among patients with higher serum phosphate levels (P for interaction = 0.02).CAC density was inversely associated with serum magnesium levels, particularly in patients with higher serum phosphate levels."
https://openalex.org/W2523011536,"Purpose To determine whether the severity of salivary-gland involvement, assessed using salivary gland ultrasonography [SGUS], histological focus score, or the unstimulated whole salivary flow [UWSF], was associated with the response to rituximab in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome [pSS]. Materials and Methods Among the 120 patients with pSS enrolled in the randomised TEARS trial of rituximab versus placebo, 35 underwent either centralised minor salivary-gland biopsy or SGUS at inclusion. The echostructure of each parotid and submandibular gland was graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Histologic minor salivary gland involvement was assessed by the focus score. Among rituximab-treated patients with available data (n = 14), half met the Sjögren’s Syndrome Responder Index [SSRI]-30 definition of a response at week 24. Results The SGUS score correlated positively to the focus score [r = 0.61] and negatively to the UWSF [r = -0.68]. The focus score was not correlated to the UWSF. The median total SGUS grade at inclusion was 9 [6-11] in responders versus 16 [11-16] in non-responders [p = 0.04]. The proportion of SSRI-30 responders was 0% among patients with SGUS grade 4 and 88% among those with SGUS grade ≤3. Low baseline SGUS scores were associated with sicca-related outcomes improvement, but not with fatigue or biological improvement. Median baseline focus score was 0.3 [0.0–1.3] in the responders versus 4.0 [2.7–5.3] in the non-responders [p = 0.02]. Baseline UWSF was not associated with the response rate. Conclusion In patients with pSS, the highest SGUS grade or a high histological focus score is associated with absence of a response to a single rituximab course after 6 months. Further studies, including more patients and different treatment strategies, are required to confirm the clinical utility of these potential biomarkers in pSS."
https://openalex.org/W2522903112,"Since its inception in 2010, the Arab Spring has evolved into a situation of violent conflict in many countries, leading to high levels of migration from the affected region. Given the social impact of the large number of individuals applying for asylum across Europe in 2015, it is important to study who these persons are in terms of their skills, motivations, and intentions. DiPAS (Displaced Persons in Austria Survey) aims to uncover the socio-demographic characteristics of the persons seeking refuge who arrived in Austria in 2015, mainly originating from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Particular focus is on human capital, attitudes and values. This survey, the first of its kind in Austria and possibly in Europe, was carried out among adult displaced persons, mostly residing in Vienna, yielding 514 completed interviews. Information gathered on spouses and children allows for the analysis of 972 persons living in Austria, and of further 419 partners and children abroad. Results indicate that the surveyed population comprised mainly young families with children, particularly those coming from Syria and Iraq. Their educational level is high compared with the average level in their country of origin. A vast majority of respondents are Muslims, rating their religiosity at medium levels. Judging from stated attitudes towards gender equity, interviewed men seem to have more liberal attitudes than their compatriots. The majority of respondents do not intend to return to their home countries, mostly because of the perception of permanent threat. DiPAS provides data for political decision-making and the on-going societal dialogue. Its findings can help to inform assessments about the integration potential of the displaced population into the host society. In addition, the applied methodological technique and experiences during the fieldwork provide valuable insights on sampling asylum seekers and refugees in the current European context."
https://openalex.org/W2522039915,"Global metrics of land cover and land use provide a fundamental basis to examine the spatial variability of human-induced impacts on freshwater ecosystems. However, microscale processes and site specific conditions related to bank vegetation, pollution sources, adjacent land use and water uses can have important influences on ecosystem conditions, in particular in smaller tributary rivers. Compared to larger order rivers, these low-order streams and rivers are more numerous, yet often under-monitored. The present study explored the relationship of nutrient concentrations in 150 streams in 57 hydrological basins in South, Central and North America (Buenos Aires, Curitiba, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Vancouver) with macroscale information available from global datasets and microscale data acquired by trained citizen scientists. Average sub-basin phosphate (P-PO4) concentrations were found to be well correlated with sub-basin attributes on both macro and microscales, while the relationships between sub-basin attributes and nitrate (N-NO3) concentrations were limited. A phosphate threshold for eutrophic conditions (>0.1 mg L-1 P-PO4) was exceeded in basins where microscale point source discharge points (eg. residential, industrial, urban/road) were identified in more than 86% of stream reaches monitored by citizen scientists. The presence of bankside vegetation covaried (rho = –0.53) with lower phosphate concentrations in the ecosystems studied. Macroscale information on nutrient loading allowed for a strong separation between basins with and without eutrophic conditions. Most importantly, the combination of macroscale and microscale information acquired increased our ability to explain sub-basin variability of P-PO4 concentrations. The identification of microscale point sources and bank vegetation conditions by citizen scientists provided important information that local authorities could use to improve their management of lower order river ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2521779182,"Marek’s disease (MD), caused by Marek’s disease virus (MDV), a poultry-borne alphaherpesvirus, is a devastating disease of poultry causing an estimated annual loss of one billion dollars to poultry producers, worldwide. Despite decades of control through vaccination, MDV field strains continue to emerge having increased virulence. The evolutionary mechanism driving the emergence of this continuum of strains to increased MDV virulence, however, remains largely enigmatic. Increase in MDV virulence has been associated with specific amino acid changes within the C-terminus domain of Mareks’s EcoRI-Q (meq)-encoded oncoprotein. In this study, we sought to determine whether the meq gene has evolved adaptively and whether past vaccination efforts have had any significant effect on the reduction or increase of MDV diversity over time. Our analysis suggests that meq is estimated to be evolving at a much faster rate than most dsDNA viruses, and is comparable with the evolutionary rate of RNA viruses. Interestingly, most of the polymorphisms in meq gene appear to have evolved under positive selection and the time of divergence at the meq locus coincides with the period during which the poultry industry had undergone transitions in management practices including the introduction and widespread use of live attenuated vaccines. Our study has revealed that the decades-long use of vaccines did not reduce MDV diversity, but rather had a stimulating effect on the emergence of field strains with increased genetic diversity until the early 2000s. During the years 2004–2005, there was an abrupt decline in the genetic diversity of field isolates followed by a recovery from this bottleneck in the year 2010. Collectively, these data suggest that vaccination seems to not have had any effect on MDV eradication, but rather had a stimulating effect on MDV emergence through adaptation."

However, the functions and characteristics of the endothelial cells (ECs) in MMD are unknown. We analyzed these features using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs.iPSC lines were established from the peripheral blood of three patients with MMD carrying the variant RNF213 R4810K, and three healthy persons used as controls. After the endothelial differentiation of iPSCs, CD31+CD144+ cells were purified as ECs using a cell sorter. We analyzed their proliferation, angiogenesis, and responses to some angiogenic factors, namely VEGF, bFGF, TGF-β, and BMP4. The ECs were also analyzed using DNA microarray and proteomics to perform comprehensive gene and protein expression analysis.Angiogenesis was significantly impaired in MMD regardless of the presence of any angiogenic factor. On the contrary, endothelial proliferation was not significant between control- and MMD-derived cells. Regarding DNA microarray, pathway analysis illustrated that extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor-related genes, including integrin β3, were significantly downregulated in MMD. Proteomic analysis revealed that cytoskeleton-related proteins were downregulated and splicing regulation-related proteins were upregulated in MMD.Downregulation of ECM receptor-related genes may be associated with impaired angiogenic activity in ECs derived from iPSCs from patients with MMD. Upregulation of splicing regulation-related proteins implied differences in splicing patterns between control and MMD ECs."

Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) is being scaled up in Sahelian countries of West Africa. However, the potential development of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to the respective component drugs is a major concern.


Methods 
Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted before (August 2012) and after (June 2014) a pilot implementation of SMC in Koutiala, Mali. Children aged 3–59 months received 7 rounds of curative doses of SP plus AQ over two malaria seasons. Genotypes of P. falciparum Pfdhfr codons 51, 59 and 108; Pfdhps codons 437 and 540, Pfcrt codon 76 and Pfmdr1codon 86 were analyzed by PCR on DNA from samples collected before and after SMC, and in non-SMC patient population as controls (November 2014).


Results 
In the SMC population 191/662 (28.9%) and 85/670 (12.7%) of children were P. falciparum positive by microscopy and were included in the molecular analysis before (2012) and after SMC implementation (2014), respectively. In the non-SMC patient population 220/310 (71%) were successfully PCR analyzed. In the SMC children, the prevalence of all molecular markers of SP resistance increased significantly after SMC including the Pfdhfr-dhps quintuple mutant genotype, which was 1.6% before but 7.1% after SMC (p = 0.02). The prevalence of Pfmdr1-86Y significantly decreased from 26.7% to 15.3% (p = 0.04) while no significant change was seen for Pfcrt 76T. In 2014, prevalence of all molecular markers of SP resistance were significantly higher among SMC children compared to the non-SMC population patient (p < 0.01). No Pfdhfr-164 mutation was found neither at baseline nor post SMC.


Conclusion 
SMC increased the prevalence of molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance to SP in the treated children. However, there was no significant increase of these markers of resistance in the general parasite population after 2 years and 7 rounds of SMC."

Linear regression analysis was used to investigate associations between HCC and adiposity measures while taking into account possible confounding factors. Analyses were performed examining the association between HCC and BMI, fat mass and fat free mass index Z-scores, as well as waist circumference and waist-hip ratio among the children. Likewise, the association between HCC and BMI among the parents was explored. Finally, we examined the association between parental HCC and children's adiposity measures.HCC was directly associated with a higher BMI among the fathers (0.49 kg/m2 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.90, P = 0.02] per 100 pg/mg) and the mothers (0.93 kg/m2 [95% CI: 0.24, 1.61, P = 0.01] per 100 pg/mg). We found no clear evidence of an association between HCC and adiposity measures among children. However, a high maternal HCC was associated with a high fat mass index and low fat free mass index z-score in the offspring (0.14 SD [95% CI: 0.02, 0.26, P = 0.02] and -0.17 SD [95% CI: -0.30, -0.05, P = 0.01] per 100 pg/mg, respectively).Our study found no evidence of an association between HCC and measures of adiposity among children predisposed to obesity. However, HCC may be directly associated with BMI among men and women, and maternal HCC may be related to a higher fat mass and a lower fat free mass among their children."
https://openalex.org/W2522451368,"Swine Influenza A Viruses (swIAVs) have been shown to persist in farrow-to-finish pig herds with repeated outbreaks in successive batches, increasing the risk for respiratory disorders in affected animals and being a threat for public health. Although the general routes of swIAV transmission (i.e. direct contact and exposure to aerosols) were clearly identified, the transmission process between batches is still not fully understood. Maternally derived antibodies (MDAs) were stressed as a possible factor favoring within-herd swIAV persistence. However, the relationship between MDAs and the global spread among the different subpopulations in the herds is still lacking. The aim of this study was therefore to understand the mechanisms induced by MDAs in relation with swIAV spread and persistence in farrow-to-finish pig herds. A metapopulation model has been developed representing the population dynamics considering two subpopulations—breeding sows and growing pigs—managed according to batch-rearing system. This model was coupled with a swIAV-specific epidemiological model, accounting for partial passive immunity protection in neonatal piglets and an immunity boost in re-infected animals. Airborne transmission was included by a between-room transmission rate related to the current prevalence of shedding pigs. Maternally derived partial immunity in piglets was found to extend the duration of the epidemics within their batch, allowing for efficient between-batch transmission and resulting in longer swIAV persistence at the herd level. These results should be taken into account in the design of control programmes for the spread and persistence of swIAV in swine herds."
https://openalex.org/W2522576107,"Leaf shape, including leaf size, leaf dissection index (LDI), and venation distribution, strongly impacts leaf physiology and the forces of momentum exerted on leaves or the canopy under windy conditions. Yet, little has been known about how leaf shape affects the morphological response of trees to wind load. We studied eight Quercus species, with different leaf shapes, to determine the morphological response to simulated wind load. Quercus trees with long elliptical leaves, were significantly affected by wind load (P< 0.05), as indicted by smaller specific leaf area (SLA), stem base diameter and stem height under windy conditions when compared to the control. The Quercus trees with leaves characterized by lanceolate or sinuous edges, showed positive morphological responses to wind load, such as bigger leaf thickness, larger stem diameter, allocation to root biomass, and smaller stem height (P< 0.05). These morphological responses to wind can reduce drag and increase the mechanical strength of the tree. Leaf dissection index (LDI), an important index of leaf shape, was correlated with morphological response to wind load (P< 0.05), including differences in SLA, in stem base diameter and in allocation to root biomass. These results suggest that trees with higher LDI, such as those with more and/or deeper lobes, are better adapted to wind load."
https://openalex.org/W2521342513,"19(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (19(S)-HETE) belongs to a family of arachidonic acid metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which play critical roles in the regulation of cardiovascular, renal and pulmonary functions. Although it has been known for a long time that 19(S)-HETE has vascular effects, its mechanism of action has remained unclear. In this study we show that 19(S)-HETE induces cAMP accumulation in the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line MEG-01. This effect was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 520 nM, insensitive to pharmacological inhibition of COX-1/2 and required the expression of the G-protein Gs. Systematic siRNA-mediated knock-down of each G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in MEG-01 followed by functional analysis identified the prostacyclin receptor (IP) as the mediator of the effects of 19(S)-HETE, and the heterologously expressed IP receptor was also activated by 19(S)-HETE in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 567 nM. Pretreatment of isolated murine platelets with 19(S)-HETE blocked thrombin-induced platelets aggregation, an effect not seen in platelets from mice lacking the IP receptor. Furthermore, 19(S)-HETE was able to relax mouse mesenteric artery- and thoracic aorta-derived vessel segments. While pharmacological inhibition of COX-1/2 enzymes had no effect on the vasodilatory activity of 19(S)-HETE these effects were not observed in vessels from mice lacking the IP receptor. These results identify a novel mechanism of action for the CYP450-dependent arachidonic acid metabolite 19(S)-HETE and point to the existence of a broader spectrum of naturally occurring prostanoid receptor agonists."
https://openalex.org/W2521587665,"Arabidopsis thaliana is the most widely used model organism for research in plant biology. While significant advances in understanding plant growth and development have been made by focusing on the molecular genetics of Arabidopsis, extracting and understanding the functional framework of metabolism is challenging, both from a technical perspective due to losses and modification during extraction of metabolites from the leaves, and from the biological perspective, due to random variation obscuring how well the function is performed. The purpose of this work is to establish the in vivo metabolic profile directly from the Arabidopsis thaliana leaves without metabolite extraction, to reduce the complexity of the results by multivariate analysis, and to unravel the mitigation of cellular complexity by predominant functional periodicity. To achieve this, we use the circadian cycle that strongly influences metabolic and physiological processes and exerts control over the photosynthetic machinery. High resolution-magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS NMR) was applied to obtain the metabolic profile directly from intact Arabidopsis leaves. Combining one- and two-dimensional 1H HR-MAS NMR allowed the identification of several metabolites including sugars and amino acids in intact leaves. Multivariate analysis on HR-MAS NMR spectra of leaves throughout the circadian cycle revealed modules of primary metabolites with significant and consistent variations of their molecular components at different time points of the circadian cycle. Since robust photosynthetic performance in plants relies on the functional periodicity of the circadian rhythm, our results show that HR-MAS NMR promises to be an important non-invasive method that can be used for metabolomics of the Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with altered physiology and photosynthetic efficiency."

Accurate identification of antioxidant proteins could contribute to revealing physiological processes of oxidation/antioxidation balance and developing novel antioxidation-based drugs. In this study, an ensemble method is presented to predict antioxidant proteins with hybrid features, incorporating SSI (Secondary Structure Information), PSSM (Position Specific Scoring Matrix), RSA (Relative Solvent Accessibility), and CTD (Composition, Transition, Distribution). The prediction results of the ensemble predictor are determined by an average of prediction results of multiple base classifiers. Based on a classifier selection strategy, we obtain an optimal ensemble classifier composed of RF (Random Forest), SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization), NNA (Nearest Neighbor Algorithm), and J48 with an accuracy of 0.925. A Relief combined with IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) method is adopted to obtain optimal features from hybrid features. With the optimal features, the ensemble method achieves improved performance with a sensitivity of 0.95, a specificity of 0.93, an accuracy of 0.94, and an MCC (Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient) of 0.880, far better than the existing method. To evaluate the prediction performance objectively, the proposed method is compared with existing methods on the same independent testing dataset. Encouragingly, our method performs better than previous studies. In addition, our method achieves more balanced performance with a sensitivity of 0.878 and a specificity of 0.860. These results suggest that the proposed ensemble method can be a potential candidate for antioxidant protein prediction.

The mean distance between the fourteen lingual nerves and the alveolar ridge was 12.36 mm, and they were located 12.03 mm from the lower border of the mandible. These distances were varied when near the first molar (M1), second molar (M2) and third molar (M3). The lingual nerve coursed on the floor of the mouth for approximately 25.43 mm before it deviated toward the tongue anywhere between the mesial of M1 and distal of M2. Thirteen lingual nerves were found to loop around the submandibular duct for an average distance of 6.92 mm (95% CI: 5.24 to 8.60 mm). Their looping occurred anywhere between the M2 and M3. In 76.9% of the cases the loop started around the M3 region and the majority (69.2%) of these looping ended at between the first and second molars and at the lingual developmental groove of the second molar. It gave out as many as 4 branches at its terminal end at the ventral surface of the tongue, with the presence of 2 branches being the most common pattern. An awareness of the variations of the lingual nerve is important to prevent any untoward complications or nerve injury and it is hoped that these findings will be useful for planning of surgical procedures related to the alveolar crest, submandibular gland/ duct and surrounding areas."

https://openalex.org/W2523254171,"Type 1 diabetes occurs due to the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells in islets. Transplantation of islets is a promising option for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes that experience hypoglycemic unawareness despite maximal care, but the present shortage of donor islets hampers such transplantation. Transplantation of insulin-producing cells derived from the patients themselves would be one of the most promising approaches to cure type 1 diabetes. Previously, we demonstrated that insulin-producing cells could be produced by transfecting murine pancreatic cells with Yamanaka's reprogramming factors. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice are naturally occurring mutant mice defective in insulin production due to autoimmune ablation of pancreatic β-cells. In this study, we showed that glucose-sensitive insulin-producing cells are successfully generated by transfecting primary pancreatic cells from NOD mice (aged 6 months old) with a plasmid harboring the cDNAs for Oct-3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Transfection was repeated 4 times in a 2 day-interval. Sixty-five days after final transfection, cobblestone-like colonies appeared. They proliferated in vitro and expressed pluripotency-related genes as well as Pdx1, a transcription factor specific to tissue-specific stem cells for the β-cell lineage. Transplantation of these cells into nude mice failed to produce teratoma unlike induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Induction of these cells to the pancreatic β-cell lineage demonstrated their capability to produce insulin in response to glucose. These findings suggest that functional pancreatic β-cells can be produced from patients with type 1 diabetes. We call these resultant cells as ""induced tissue-specific stem cells from the pancreas"" (iTS-P) that could be valuable sources of safe and effective materials for cell-based therapy in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2521533596,"Cell polarity and precise subcellular protein localization are pivotal to neuronal function. The SNARE machinery underlies intracellular membrane fusion events, but its role in neuronal polarity and selective protein targeting remain unclear. Here we report that syntaxin 3 is involved in orchestrating polarized trafficking in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We show that syntaxin 3 localizes to the axonal plasma membrane, particularly to axonal tips, whereas syntaxin 4 localizes to the somatodendritic plasma membrane. Disruption of a conserved N-terminal targeting motif, which causes mislocalization of syntaxin 3, results in coincident mistargeting of the axonal cargos neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule (NgCAM) and neurexin, but not transferrin receptor, a somatodendritic cargo. Similarly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous syntaxin 3 leads to partial mistargeting of NgCAM, demonstrating that syntaxin 3 plays an important role in its targeting. Additionally, overexpression of syntaxin 3 results in increased axonal growth. Our findings suggest an important role for syntaxin 3 in maintaining neuronal polarity and in the critical task of selective trafficking of membrane protein to axons."
https://openalex.org/W2521544314,"Period 2-mutant mice (Per2m/m), which possess a circadian dysfunction, recapitulate the retinal vascular phenotype similar to diabetic retinopathy (DR). The vascular dysfunction in Per2m/m is associated with an increase in connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). At the molecular level, CTGF gene expression is dependent on the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The nuclear binding of β-catenin to a transcription factor, lymphoid enhancer binding protein (Lef)/ T-cell factor (TCF/LEF), leads to downstream activation of CTGF. For this study, we hypothesized that the silencing of Per2 results in nuclear translocation and subsequent transactivation of the CTGF gene. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunofluorescence labeling for CTGF in retinal sections from wild-type (WT) and Per2m/m mice. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were transfected with siRNA for Per2, and the protein expression of CTGF and β-catenin was evaluated. The TCF/LEF luciferase reporter (TOPflash) assay was performed to validate the involvement of β-catenin in the activation of CTGF. Per2m/m retinas exhibited an increased CTGF immunostaining in ganglion cell layer and retinal endothelium. Silencing of Per2 using siRNA resulted in an upregulation of CTGF and β-catenin. The TOPflash assay revealed an increase in luminescence for HRECs transfected with Per2 siRNA. Our studies show that loss of Per2 results in an activation of CTGF via nuclear entry of β-catenin. Our study provides novel insight into the understanding of microvascular dysfunction in Per2m/m mice."
https://openalex.org/W2522858541,"Transposons, or transposable elements, are the major components of genomes in most eukaryotes. Some groups of transposons have developed target specificity that limits the integration sites to a specific nonessential sequence or a genomic region to avoid gene disruption caused by insertion into an essential gene. R2 is one of the most intensively investigated groups of sequence-specific non-LTR retrotransposons and is inserted at a specific site inside of 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. R2 is known to be distributed among at least six animal phyla even though its occurrence is reported to be patchy. Here, in order to obtain a more detailed picture of the distribution of R2, we surveyed R2 using both in silico screening and degenerate PCR, particularly focusing on actinopterygian fish. We found two families of the R2C lineage from vertebrates, although it has previously only been found in platyhelminthes. We also revealed the apparent movement of insertion sites of a lineage of actinopterygian R2, which was likely concurrent with the acquisition of a 28S rRNA-derived sequence in their 3' UTR. Outside of actinopterygian fish, we revealed the maintenance of a single R2 lineage in birds; the co-existence of four lineages of R2 in the leafcutter bee Megachile rotundata; the first examples of R2 in Ctenophora, Mollusca, and Hemichordata; and two families of R2 showing no target specificity. These findings indicate that R2 is relatively stable and universal, while differences in the distribution and maintenance of R2 lineages probably reflect characteristics of some combination of both R2 lineages and host organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2522070895,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism causing monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. Disruption of imprinted genes causes various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the role of imprinted genes in the brain is largely unknown. Different cell types within distinct brain regions can influence the genomic imprinting status, but imprinted genes in single cell types within distinct brain regions have not been characterized on a genome-wide scale. To address this critical question, we used a multi-stage approach, which combined genetically engineered mice with fluorescence-based laser capture microdissection (LCM) to capture excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and astrocytes as single cells in layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex. RNA sequencing determined parental expression patterns on a genome-wide scale in the captured cells within specific brain regions. The expression level of cell-type-specific genes for excitatory neurons (13 genes), inhibitory neurons (16 genes) and astrocytes (20 genes) confirmed the LCM-captured cells maintained their cellular identities. The parent-of-origin-specific expression pattern of imprinted genes, including maternally expressed Meg3 and paternally expressed Peg3, provided evidence that the status of known imprinted genes was also maintained. Although our platform remains to be improved, our findings demonstrate the parental expression pattern can be analysed not only at the level of a single cell type but also at the level of specific cortical layers. Our approach has the potential to reveal novel regulatory modules associated with plasticity through genomic imprinting mechanisms in different cell types, not only in the visual cortex but also in other brain regions."

Important physiological processes (including secretion, immune responses, motility, and transcription) are placed under diacylglycerol control by the distinctive substrate specificity and subcellular distribution of PKDs. Potentially, broadly co-expressed PKD polypeptides may interact to generate homo- or heteromultimeric regulatory complexes. However, the frequency, molecular basis, regulatory significance, and physiological relevance of stable PKD-PKD interactions are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mammalian PKDs 1–3 and the prototypical Caenorhabditis elegans PKD, DKF-2A, are exclusively (homo- or hetero-) dimers in cell extracts and intact cells. We discovered and characterized a novel, highly conserved N-terminal domain, comprising 92 amino acids, which mediates dimerization of PKD1, PKD2, and PKD3 monomers. A similar domain directs DKF-2A homodimerization. Dimerization occurred independently of properties of the regulatory and kinase domains of PKDs. Disruption of PKD dimerization abrogates secretion of PAUF, a protein carried in small trans-Golgi network-derived vesicles. In addition, disruption of DKF-2A homodimerization in C. elegans intestine impaired and degraded the immune defense of the intact animal against an ingested bacterial pathogen. Finally, dimerization was indispensable for the strong, dominant negative effect of catalytically inactive PKDs.

https://openalex.org/W2522360273,"Efficiency in the use of resources stream-lined for expected conditions could lead to reduced system diversity and consequently endanger resilience. We tested the hypothesis of a trade-off between farm resource-use efficiency and land-use diversity. We applied stochastic frontier production models to assess the dependence of resource-use-efficiency on land-use diversity as illustrated by the Shannon-Weaver index. Total revenue in relation to use of capital, land and labour on the farms in Southern Finland with a size exceeding 30 ha was studied. The data were extracted from the Finnish Profitability Bookkeeping data. Our results indicate that there is either no trade-off or a negligible trade-off of no economic importance. The small dependence of resource-use efficiency on land-use diversity can be positive as well as negative. We conclude that diversification as a strategy to enhance farm resilience does not necessarily constrain resource-use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2522454661,"The monotypic species Ossubtus xinguense was originally described based on scarce material putatively divided into juveniles and adults. Ossubtus xinguense has a restricted distribution and was previously known only from a few rapids downstream of the city of Altamira, in the Volta Grande stretch of the Middle Xingu River. Until recently, the species was rare in museums because its habitat (large rapids) is difficult to sample. Large-scale collecting efforts targeting rapids throughout the Xingu River basin have yielded an abundance of new material. Based on an analysis of the type series and freshly preserved specimens, we redescribe O. xinguense and provide detailed osteological descriptions along with comments about its relationships within Serrasalmidae. Furthermore, we expand the geographical distribution of the species and discuss its conservation status."
https://openalex.org/W2522654225,"The neurotransmitter GABA has been recently identified as a potent immunosuppressive agent that targets both innate and adaptive immune systems and prevents disease progression of several autoimmunity models. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing progenitor cells that differentiate into various cell types under specific conditions, including neurons. In addition, MSC possess strong immunosuppressive capabilities. Upon cytokine priming, undifferentiated MSC suppress T-cell proliferation via cell-to-cell contact mechanisms and the secretion of soluble factors like nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 and IDO. Although MSC and MSC-derived neuron-like cells express some GABAergic markers in vitro, the role for GABAergic signaling in MSC-mediated immunosuppression remains completely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines selectively regulate GAD-67 expression in murine bone marrow-MSC. However, expression of GAD-65 is required for maximal GABA release by MSC. Gain of function experiments using GAD-67 and GAD-65 co-expression demonstrates that GAD increases immunosuppressive function in the absence of pro-inflammatory licensing. Moreover, GAD expression in MSC evokes an increase in both GABA and NO levels in the supernatants of co-cultured MSC with activated splenocytes. Notably, the increase in NO levels by GAD expression was not observed in cultures of isolated MSC expressing GAD, suggesting crosstalk between these two pathways in the setting of immunosuppression. These results indicate that GAD expression increases MSC-mediated immunosuppression via secretion of immunosuppressive agents. Our findings may help reconsider GABAergic activation in MSC for immunological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2522873321,"Objectives To investigate the prognostic value of B-mode and Power Doppler (PD) ultrasound of the median nerve for the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods Prospective study of 135 patients with suspected CTS seen 3 times: at baseline, then at short-term (3 months) and long-term (15–36 months) follow-up. At baseline, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve was measured with ultrasound at 4 levels on the forearm and wrist. PD signals were graded semi-quantitatively (0–3). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at each visit with the Boston Questionnaire (BQ) and the DASH Questionnaire, as well as visual analogue scales for the patient’s assessment of pain (painVAS) and physician’s global assessment (physVAS). The predictive values of baseline CSA and PD for clinical outcomes were determined with multivariate logistic regression models. Results Short-term and long-term follow-up data were available for 111 (82.2%) and 105 (77.8%) patients, respectively. There was a final diagnosis of CTS in 84 patients (125 wrists). Regression analysis revealed that the CSA, measured at the carpal tunnel inlet, predicted short-term clinical improvement according to BQ in CTS patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery (OR 1.8, p = 0.05), but not in patients treated conservatively. Neither CSA nor PD assessments predicted short-term improvement of painVAS, physVAS or DASH, nor was any of the ultrasound parameters useful for the prediction of long-term clinical outcomes. Conclusions Ultrasound assessment of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet may predict short-term clinical improvement in CTS patients undergoing carpal tunnel release, but long-term outcomes are unrelated to ultrasound findings."
https://openalex.org/W2521076616,"Crucial factors influencing the epidemiology of Rickettsia felis rickettsiosis include pathogenesis and transmission. Detection of R. felis DNA in a number of arthropod species has been reported, with characterized isolates, R. felis strain LSU and strain LSU-Lb, generated from the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, and the non-hematophagous booklouse, Liposcelis bostrychophila, respectively. While it is realized that strain influence on host biology varies, the rickettsial response to these distinct host environments remained undefined. To identify a panel of potential rickettsial transmission determinants in the cat flea, the transcriptional profile for these two strains of R. felis were compared in their arthropod hosts using RNAseq. Rickettsial genes with increased transcription in the flea as compared to the booklouse were identified. Genes previously associated with bacterial virulence including LPS biosynthesis, Type IV secretion system, ABC transporters, and a toxin-antitoxin system were selected for further study. Transcription of putative virulence-associated genes was determined in a flea infection bioassay for both strains of R. felis. A host-dependent transcriptional profile during bloodfeeding, specifically, an increased expression of selected transcripts in newly infected cat fleas and flea feces was detected when compared to arthropod cell culture and incubation in vertebrate blood. Together, these studies have identified novel, host-dependent rickettsial factors that likely contribute to successful horizontal transmission by bloodfeeding arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W2522079270,"Mucolipidosis II and III alpha/beta are autosomal recessive diseases caused by mutations in the GNPTAB gene which encodes the α and β subunits of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. Clinically, mucolipidosis II (MLII) is characterized by severe developmental delay, coarse facial features, skeletal deformities, and other systemic involvement. In contrast, MLIII alpha/beta is a much milder disorder, the symptoms of which include progressive joint stiffness, short stature, and scoliosis. To study the relationship between the genotypes and phenotypes of the MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients, we analyzed the GNPTAB gene in 16 Chinese MLII and MLIII alpha/beta patients. We collected and analyzed the patients' available clinical data and all showed clinical features typical of MLII or MLIII alpha/beta. Moreover, the activity of several lysosomal enzymes was measured in the plasma and finally the GNPTAB gene was sequenced. We detected 30 mutant alleles out of 32 alleles in our patients. These include 10 new mutations (c.99delC, c.118-1G>A, c.523_524delAAinsG, c.1212C>G, c.2213C>A, c.2345C>T, c.2356C>T, c.2455G>T, c.2821dupA, and c.3136-2A>G) and 5 previously reported mutations (c.1071G>A, c.1090C>T, c.2715+1G>A, c.2550_2554delGAAA, and c.3613C>T). The most frequent mutation was the splicing mutation c.2715+1G>A, which accounted for 28% of the mutations. The majority of the mutations reported in the Chinese patients (57%) were located on exon 13 or in its intronic flanking regions."
https://openalex.org/W2523708145,"During eating, the teeth usually endure the sharply temperature changes because of different foods. It is of importance to investigate the heat transfer and heat dissipation behavior of the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) of human tooth since dentine and enamel have different thermophysical properties. The spatial and temporal temperature distributions on the enamel, dentine, and pulpal chamber of both the human tooth and its discontinuous boundaries, were measured using infrared thermography using a stepped temperature increase on the outer boundary of enamel crowns. The thermal diffusivities for enamel and dentine were deduced from the time dependent temperature change at the enamel and dentine layers. The thermal conductivities for enamel and dentine were calculated to be 0.81 Wm-1K-1 and 0.48 Wm-1K-1 respectively. The observed temperature discontinuities across the interfaces between enamel, dentine and pulp-chamber layers were due to the difference of thermal conductivities at interfaces rather than to the phase transformation. The temperature gradient distributes continuously across the enamel and dentine layers and their junction below a temperature of 42°C, whilst a negative thermal resistance is observed at interfaces above 42°C. These results suggest that the microstructure of the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ) junction play an important role in tooth heat transfer and protects the pulp from heat damage."
https://openalex.org/W2521061633,"Intermittent alcohol exposure is a common pattern of alcohol consumption among adolescents and alcohol is known to modulate the expression of the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is involved in metabolism and inflammation. However, it is unknown whether this pattern may have short-term consequences on the ECS in the spleen. To address this question, we examined the plasma concentrations of metabolic and inflammatory signals and the splenic ECS in early adult rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence. A 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) procedure for 4 weeks was used as a model of intermittent forced-alcohol administration (20%, v/v) in female and male Wistar rats, which were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last DID session. First, there was no liver damage or alterations in plasma metabolic parameters. However, certain plasma inflammatory signals were altered according to sex and alcohol exposition. Whereas fractalkine [chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1] was only affected by sex with lower concentration in male rats, there was an interaction between sex and alcohol exposure in the TNF-α and interleukin-6 concentrations and only female rats displayed changes. Regarding the mRNA and protein expression of the ECS, the receptors and endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzymes were found to be altered with area-specific expression patterns in the spleen. Overall, whereas the expression of the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor PPARα were lower in alcohol-exposed rats compared to control rats, the CB2 expression was higher. Additionally, the N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D expression was high in female alcohol-exposed rats and low in male alcohol-exposed rats. In conclusion, intermittent alcohol consumption during adolescence may be sufficient to induce short-term changes in the expression of splenic endocannabinoid signaling-related proteins and plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines in young adult rats with a strong sexual dimorphism. The potential impact of these alterations in early adulthood remains to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2521850754,"The cytoplasmic viral sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), which is also known as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), senses viral RNA to activate antiviral signaling. It is therefore thought that RIG-I is regulated in a STAT1-dependent manner. Although RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling is indispensable for the induction of an appropriate adaptive immune response, the mechanism underlying the regulation of RIG-I expression remains elusive. Here, we examined the direct regulation of RIG-I expression by interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), which is an essential molecule for antiviral innate immunity. We initially found that RIG-I can be induced by dsRNA in both IFN-independent and IRF-3-dependent manners. A sequence analysis revealed that the RIG-I gene has putative IRF-3-binding sites in its promoter region. Using a combination of cellular, molecular biological, and mutational approaches, we first showed that IRF-3 can directly regulate the expression of RIG-I via a single IRF-element (IRF-E) site in the proximal promoter region of the RIG-I gene in response to dsRNA. IRF-3 is considered a master regulator in antiviral signaling for the generation of type I interferons (IFNs). Thus, our findings demonstrate that RIG-I expression induced by the IRF-3-mediated pathway may serve as a crucial antiviral factor for reinforcing a surveillance system against viral invasion through the regulation of the cytoplasmic viral sensor RIG-I."
https://openalex.org/W2523752290,"Twenty-five percent of polyneuropathies are idiopathic. Microangiopathy has been suggested to be a possible pathogenic cause of chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP). Dysfunction of the autophagy pathway has been implicated as a marker of neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, but the autophagy process is not explored in the peripheral nervous system. In the current study, we examined the presence of microangiopathy and autophagy-related structures in sural nerve biopsies of 10 patients with CIAP, 11 controls with inflammatory neuropathy and 10 controls without sensory polyneuropathy. We did not find any significant difference in endoneurial microangiopathic markers in patients with CIAP compared to normal controls, though we did find a correlation between basal lamina area thickness and age. Unexpectedly, we found a significantly larger basal lamina area thickness in patients with vasculitic neuropathy. Furthermore, we found a significantly higher density of endoneurial autophagy-related structures, particularly in patients with CIAP but also in patients with inflammatory neuropathy, compared to normal controls. It is unclear if the alteration in the autophagy pathway is a consequence or a cause of the neuropathy. Our results do not support the hypothesis that CIAP is primarily caused by a microangiopathic process in endoneurial blood vessels in peripheral nerves. The significantly higher density of autophagy structures in sural nerves obtained from patients with CIAP and inflammatory neuropathy vs. controls indicates the involvement of this pathway in neuropathy, particularly in CIAP, since the increase in density of autophagy-related structures was more pronounced in patients with CIAP than those with inflammatory neuropathy. To our knowledge this is the first report investigating signs of autophagy process in peripheral nerves in patients with CIAP and inflammatory neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2521620454,"Mosquito-transmitted diseases like malaria and dengue fever are global problem and an estimated 50–100 million of dengue or dengue hemorrhagic fever cases are reported worldwide every year. The mermithid nematode Romanomermis wuchangensis has been successfully used as an ecosystem-friendly biocontrol agent for mosquito prevention in laboratory studies. However, this nematode can not undergo sex differentiation in vitro culture, which has seriously affected their application of biocontrol in the field. In this study, based on transcriptome sequencing analysis of R. wuchangensis, Rwucmab-3, Rwuclaf-1 and Rwuctra-2 were cloned and used to investigate molecular regulatory function of sex differentiation. qRT-PCR results demonstrated that the expression level of Rwucmab-3 between male and female displayed obvious difference on the 3rd day of parasitic stage, which was earlier than Rwuclaf-1 and Rwuctra-2, highlighting sex differentiation process may start on the 3rd day of parasitic stage. Besides, FITC was used as a marker to test dsRNA uptake efficiency of R. wuchangensis, which fluorescence intensity increased with FITC concentration after 16 h incubation, indicating this nematode can successfully ingest soaking solution via its cuticle. RNAi results revealed the sex ratio of R. wuchangensis from RNAi treated groups soaked in dsRNA of Rwucmab-3 was significantly higher than gfp dsRNA treated groups and control groups, highlighting RNAi of Rwumab-3 may hinder the development of male nematodes. These results suggest that Rwucmab-3 mainly involves in the initiation of sex differentiation and the development of male sexual dimorphism. Rwuclaf-1 and Rwuctra-2 may play vital role in nematode reproductive and developmental system. In conclusion, transcript sequences presented in this study could provide more bioinformatics resources for future studies on gene cloning and other molecular regulatory mechanism in R. wuchangensis. Moreover, identification and functional analysis of sex differentiation genes may clarify the sex differentiation mechanism of R. wuchangensis, which are helpful to solve the uncompleted sex differentiation problem in vitro culture and the potential large-scale field application controlling the larvae of C. quinquefasciatus, A. aegypti and A. albopictus."
https://openalex.org/W2522432718,"With the speedy development of sequencing technologies, noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has been widely applied in clinical practice for testing for fetal aneuploidy. The cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) concentration in maternal plasma is the most critical parameter for this technology because it affects the accuracy of NIPT-based sequencing for fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13. Several approaches have been developed to calculate the cffDNA fraction of the total cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma. However, most approaches depend on specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele information or are restricted to male fetuses.In this study, we present an innovative method to accurately deduce the concentration of the cffDNA fraction using only maternal plasma DNA. SNPs were classified into four maternal-fetal genotype combinations and three boundaries were added to capture effective SNP loci in which the mother was homozygous and the fetus was heterozygous. The median value of the concentration of the fetal DNA fraction was estimated using the effective SNPs. A depth-bias correction was performed using simulated data and corresponding regression equations for adjustments when the depth of the sequencing data was below 100-fold or the cffDNA fraction is less than 10%.Using our approach, the median of the relative bias was 0.4% in 18 maternal plasma samples with a median sequencing depth of 125-fold. There was a significant association (r = 0.935) between our estimations and the estimations inferred from the Y chromosome. Furthermore, this approach could precisely estimate a cffDNA fraction as low as 3%, using only maternal plasma DNA at the targeted region with a sequencing depth of 65-fold. We also used PCR instead of parallel sequencing to calculate the cffDNA fraction. There was a significant association (r = 98.2%) between our estimations and those inferred from the Y chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2521398056,"Background Variation in the carboxylesterase 1 gene (CES1) may contribute to the efficacy of ACEIs. Accordingly, we examined the impact of CES1 variants on plasma angiotensin II (ATII)/angiotensin I (ATI) ratio in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) that underwent ACEI dose titrations. Five of these variants have previously been associated with drug response or increased CES1 expression, i.e., CES1 copy number variation, the variant of the duplicated CES1 gene with high transcriptional activity, rs71647871, rs2244613, and rs3815583. Additionally, nine variants, representatives of CES1Var, and three other CES1 variants were examined. Methods Patients with CHF, and clinical indication for ACEIs were categorized according to their CES1 genotype. Differences in mean plasma ATII/ATI ratios between genotype groups after ACEI dose titration, expressed as the least square mean (LSM) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were assessed by analysis of variance. Results A total of 200 patients were recruited and 127 patients (63.5%) completed the study. The mean duration of the CHF drug dose titration was 6.2 (SD 3.6) months. After ACEI dose titration, there was no difference in mean plasma ATII/ATI ratios between subjects with the investigated CES1 variants, and only one previously unexplored variation (rs2302722) qualified for further assessment. In the fully adjusted analysis of effects of rs2302722 on plasma ATII/ATI ratios, the difference in mean ATII/ATI ratio between the GG genotype and the minor allele carriers (GT and TT) was not significant, with a relative difference in LSMs of 0.67 (95% CI 0.43–1.07; P = 0.10). Results of analyses that only included enalapril-treated patients remained non-significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple parallel comparisons (difference in LSM 0.60 [95% CI 0.37–0.98], P = 0.045). Conclusion These findings indicate that the included single variants of CES1 do not significantly influence plasma ATII/ATI ratios in CHF patients treated with ACEIs and are unlikely to be primary determinants of ACEI efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2522179110,"Mycoplasma agalactiae is the etiological agent of the contagious agalactia syndrome in sheep and goats and causes significant economic losses worldwide. Yet the mechanism of pathogenesis is largely unknown. Even whole-genome sequence analysis of its pathogenic type strain did not lead to any conclusions regarding its virulence or pathogenicity factors. Although inflammation and tissue destruction at the local site of M. agalactiae infection are largely considered as effects of the host immune response, the direct effect of the agent on host cells is not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of M. agalactiae infection on the quality and viability of host cells in vitro. Changes in cell morphology including cell elongation, cytoplasm shrinkage and membrane blebbing were observed in infected HeLa cells. Chromatin condensation and increased caspase-3 cleavage in infected HeLa cells 48 h after infection suggests an apoptosis-like phenomenon in M. agalactiae-infected cells. In compliance with these results, decreased viability and cell lysis of M. agalactiae-infected HeLa cells was also observed. Measurement of the amount of LDH released after M. agalactiae infection revealed a time- and dose-dependent increase in HeLa cell lysis. A significant decrease in LDH released after gentamicin treatment of infected cells confirmed the major role of cytadherent M. agalactiae in inducing host cell lysis. This is the first study illustrating M. agalactiae’s induction of cytopathic effects in infected HeLa cells. Further detailed investigation of infected host tissue for apoptotic markers might demonstrate the association between M. agalactiae-induced host cell lysis and the tissue destruction observed during M. agalactiae natural infection."
https://openalex.org/W2523147883,"Parent-offspring conflict is predicted to occur because offspring will demand more parental investment than is optimal for the parent, and is said to be strongest during weaning when parents reduce nursing while offspring continue to demand parental care. While weaning conflict has been shown to be stressful in offspring, little is known about the effects of weaning conflict on mothers. We hypothesized that during weaning mothers have higher levels of stress hormone (corticosterone) compared to early lactation because of increased offspring demand. Further, we predicted that if mothers are given the option to avoid offspring solicitation they would do so and show lower corticosterone levels. We tested our hypotheses in an experimental population of rats in which one group of females was given the opportunity to avoid offspring solicitation. We measured faecal corticosterone metabolite levels using a non-invasive approach, and maternal and offspring behaviours during weaning. In contrast to our predictions, we detected lower levels of corticosterone metabolites during weaning than before, irrespective of cage type. Further, during weaning mothers did not show increased offspring avoidance behaviour although offspring solicitation increased significantly. Our results therefore cast doubt on the generally accepted notion of weaning conflict as a stressful period for mothers characterized by overt offspring solicitation."

Sixty-one consecutive patients (M: F = 27: 34, mean age 60 ± 16, mean BMI 23.6 ± 3.6 kg/m2) underwent pelvic and lower extremity CTVs [group A (n = 31, 120 kVp, reconstructed with FBP) vs. group B (n = 30, 80 kVp, reconstructed with SAFIRE)]. The vascular enhancement, image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were compared. Subjective image analysis for image quality and noise was performed by two radiologists. Radiation dose was compared between the two groups.Compared with group A, higher mean vascular enhancement was observed in the group B (group A vs. B, 118.8 ± 15.7 HU vs. 178.6 ± 39.6 HU, p < 0.001), as well as image noise (12.0 ± 3.8 HU vs. 17.9 ± 6.1 HU, p < 0.001) and CNR (5.1 ± 1.9 vs. 7.6 ± 3.0, p < 0.001). The SNRs were not significantly different in both groups (11.2 ± 4.8 vs. 10.8 ± 3.7, p = 0.617). There was no significant difference in subjective image quality between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The subjective image noise was higher in the group B (p = 0.036 in reader 1, p = 0.005 in reader 2). The inter-observer reliability for assessing subjective image quality was good (ICC 0.746~0.784, p < 0.001). The mean CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and mean dose length product (DLP) were significantly lower in group B than group A [CTDIvol, 6.4 ± 1.3 vs. 2.2 ± 2.2 mGy (p < 0.001); DLP, 499.1 ± 116.0 vs. 133.1 ± 45.7 mGy × cm (p < 0.001)].CTV using 80 kVp combined with SAFIRE provides lower radiation dose and improved CNR compared to CTV using 120 kVp with FBP."
https://openalex.org/W2523626414,"Head and neck cancers, and cardiovascular disease have been described as late effects of low dose radiation (LDR) exposure, namely in tinea capitis cohorts. In addition to radiation dose, gender and younger age at exposure, the genetic background might be involved in the susceptibility to LDR late effects. The -174 G>C (rs1800795) SNP in IL6 has been associated with cancer and cardiovascular disease, nevertheless this association is still controversial. We assessed the association of the IL6-174 G>C SNP with LDR effects such as thyroid carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma and carotid atherosclerosis in the Portuguese tinea capitis cohort. The IL6-174 G>C SNP was genotyped in 1269 individuals formerly irradiated for tinea capitis. This sampling group included thyroid cancer (n = 36), basal cell carcinoma (n = 113) and cases without thyroid or basal cell carcinoma (1120). A subgroup was assessed for atherosclerosis by ultrasonography (n = 379) and included matched controls (n = 222). Genotypes were discriminated by real-time PCR using a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. In the irradiated group, we observed that the CC genotype was significantly associated with carotid plaque risk, both in the genotypic (OR = 3.57, CI = 1.60-7.95, p-value = 0.002) and in the recessive (OR = 3.02, CI = 1.42-6.42, p-value = 0.004) models. Irradiation alone was not a risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis. We did not find a significant association of the IL6-174 C allele with thyroid carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma risk. The IL6-174 CC genotype confers a three-fold risk for carotid atherosclerotic disease suggesting it may represent a genetic susceptibility factor in the LDR context."
https://openalex.org/W2522224233,"Zinc binding domains are common and versatile protein structural motifs that mediate diverse cellular functions. Among the many structurally distinct families of zinc finger (ZnF) proteins, the AN1 domain remains poorly characterized. Cuz1 is one of two AN1 ZnF proteins in the yeast S. cerevisiae, and is a stress-inducible protein that functions in protein degradation through direct interaction with the proteasome and Cdc48. Here we report the solution structure of the Cuz1 AN1 ZnF which reveals a compact C6H2 zinc-coordinating domain that resembles a two-finger hand holding a tri-helical clamp. A central phenylalanine residue sits between the two zinc-coordinating centers. The position of this phenylalanine, just before the penultimate zinc-chelating cysteine, is strongly conserved from yeast to man. This phenylalanine shows an exceptionally slow ring-flipping rate which likely contributes to the high rigidity and stability of the AN1 domain. In addition to the zinc-chelating residues, sequence analysis of Cuz1 indicates a second highly evolutionarily conserved motif. This LDFLP motif is shared with three human proteins-Zfand1, AIRAP, and AIRAP-L-the latter two of which share similar cellular functions with Cuz1. The LDFLP motif, while embedded within the zinc finger domain, is surface exposed, largely uninvolved in zinc chelation, and not required for the overall fold of the domain. The LDFLP motif was dispensable for Cuz1's major known functions, proteasome- and Cdc48-binding. These results provide the first structural characterization of the AN1 zinc finger domain, and suggest that the LDFLP motif may define a sub-family of evolutionarily conserved AN1 zinc finger proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2522534242,"Since the 1950s, researchers have recognized that red blood cell numbers expand or contract as needed, according to the amount of available oxygen. The later discoveries that erythropoietin and VEGF levels adapt to oxygen levels launched a new field aimed at understanding how cells sense and respond to normal- and low-oxygen environments. The 2016 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award recognizes key discoveries about this global oxygen sensing pathway and its impacts on pathogenesis, including cancer and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2523036932,"Smoking remains a serious public health concern. Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, including bupropion and varenicline, are proven means to increase quit rates. Post-marketing reports describing suicidal behaviours have raised concerns about the safety of varenicline. However, whether varenicline imparts a higher risk of suicide relative to bupropion remains uncertain.A population-based nested case-control study in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2011 to March 31, 2015 was conducted. Subjects were residents of Ontario aged 18 years and older with publicly funded drug coverage receiving either bupropion or varenicline for smoking cessation. We defined cases were those with a hospitalization or emergency department visit for suicide or non-fatal self-harm within 90 days of treatment. For each case, we identified up to fifty controls from the same cohort matched on age, sex, history of self-harm, use of selected psychotropic medications, alcohol abuse and prior admission to a mental health unit. Adjusted odds ratio were used to compare the risk of suicide/self-harm of varenicline to bupropion.We identified 331 cases and 5,346 matched-controls. Following adjustment for potential confounders, we found that varenicline was not associated with an increased risk of suicide/self-harm relative to bupropion (adjusted odds ratio 1.15; 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.87).Treatment with varenicline does not appear to significantly increase the risk of suicide or self-harm relative to bupropion."
