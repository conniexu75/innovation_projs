It reports the first large experimental inquiry, carried out by the methods of factor analysis described by Thurstone in The Vectors of the Mind 1. The work was made possible by financial grants from the Social Science Research Committee of the University of Chicago, the American Council of Education, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. The results are eminently worthy of the assistance so generously accorded. Thurstone’s previous theoretical account, lucid and comprehensive as it is, is intelligible only to those who have a knowledge of matrix algebra. Hence his methods have become known to British educationists chiefly from the monograph published by W. P. Alexander8. This enquiry has provoked a good deal of criticism, particularly from Professor Spearman’s school ; and differs, as a matter of fact, from Thurstone’s later expositions. Hence it is of the greatest value to have a full and simple illustration of his methods, based on a concrete inquiry, from Professor Thurstone himself."

https://openalex.org/W2002755248,"IN a number of cytochemical papers1,2 it has been claimed that α-hydroxyketones, such as deoxycorticosterone, give a purple colour with reduced fuchsin in Feulgen‘s ‘plasmal' reaction. In this reaction the material under test is treated with cold saturated aqueous mercuric chloride solution, then with reduced fuchsin. According to Dempsey et al.3, aqueous mercuric chloride oxidizes the hydroxy-ketone to an aldehyde, which then reacts with reduced fuchsin."
https://openalex.org/W2008501867,"IN an earlier investigation1, the molecular weight of α-amylase from pig‘s pancreas2,3 Was found to be 45,000, as calculated from the values4 s20 = 4·50 S, D = 8·05 × 10-7 C.G.S. and V20 = 0·70. At this Institute a new method for the isolation of amylase from malt has been developed5. It was shown that by repeated purification of the albumin fraction from maSlt a preparation was obtained with high α-amylase and β-amylase activity. Therefore it was assumed that the amylase activity of malt is localized in the albumin fraction. By ultracentrifugation of the albumin fraction, only one peak was obtained. It must be stated here that malt-amylase is more polydisperse than α-amylase from pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W2054307901,"A knowledge of the duration of time for which a radioactive element is retained in the, body has important significance physiologically in safety considerations and in dosage calculations in tracer studies and isotqpe radiation therapy. The biologic decay-life of sodium in man can be determined satisfactorily with the long half-life Naz2 (T>d = 3 yr.) but not with Naz4 (Tjg = 14.8 hr.). During the course of experiments Naz2, with an activity of such that 10,000,000 to 17,725,OOO disintegrations occurred per minute, was injected into each subject. A daily blood serum concentration of Naz2 was determined for from thirty to sixty consecutive days. All samples of urine were collected separately and the Na22 excretion determined for each. The subjects consisted of four control subjects free from cardiovascular and renal disease, six subjects with chronic congestive heart failure (two were slowly improving, two rapidly improving and two becoming worse) and two subjects with chronic glomerulonephritis of the nephrotic type. Since only the serum concentration of Naz2 and the rate of urine excretion of the radioelement were measured, it was not possible to know the time required to excrete one-half of the injected Naz2, the biologic half-life period(Bx), per se. Therefore, it was necessary to introduce the following terms:"
https://openalex.org/W1988564133,"THE explanation of Dr. C. A. Beevers' observations1 (which I can confirm and to which I would add the further observation that the puffs of smoke correspond to cardiac systole) would seem to lie in the close resemblance of the human chest to the box used for the production of smoke rings to which he refers. Both have relatively rigid walls with a diaphragm and an orifice. In the case of the chest the contraction of the heart muscle during systole, acting from the relatively fixed great vessels of the head and arms, pulls its diaphragmatic attachment upwards, thus reducing the volume of the thorax. Air, being the most easily displaced thoracic content, is expelled in small jets corresponding to each cardiac systole and produces the effect noted by Beevers."
