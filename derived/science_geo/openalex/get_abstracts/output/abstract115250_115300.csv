https://openalex.org/W1511542029,"We have investigated the mechanism by which osteoclasts adhere to and resorb bone. We show that these cells express beta 1 and beta 3 integrins which are involved in attachment to purified bone matrix proteins. Binding to osteopontin and bone sialoprotein is mediated by alpha v beta 3, while a beta 1 integrin is responsible for attachment to fibronectin. Both the rapid attachment by osteoclasts to intact bone particles and their subsequent resorption are blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed to the alpha v beta 3 complex but not by an antibody against beta 1 integrins. Attachment of osteoclasts to bone is also inhibited with soluble osteopontin, Arg-Gly-Asp-containing peptides derived from both osteopontin and bone sialoprotein, or a monospecific polyclonal antibody against osteopontin. We conclude that both osteoclast adherence to bone and subsequent resorption of its matrix are dependent on interactions between the bone matrix proteins osteopontin and/or bone sialoprotein and the integrin alpha v beta 3. Moreover, collagen, which constitutes 90% of its organic matrix, is minimally involved in binding of chicken osteoclasts to bone."
https://openalex.org/W2051499713,"Structures recently proposed for the FeMo-cofactor and P-cluster pair of the nitrogenase molybdenum-iron (MoFe)-protein from Azotobacter vinelandii have been crystallographically verified at 2.2 angstrom resolution. Significantly, no hexacoordinate sulfur atoms are observed in either type of metal center. Consequently, the six bridged iron atoms in the FeMo-cofactor are trigonally coordinated by nonprotein ligands, although there may be some iron-iron bonding interactions that could provide a fourth coordination interaction for these sites. Two of the cluster sulfurs in the P-cluster pair are very close together (approximately 2.1 angstroms), indicating that they form a disulfide bond. These findings indicate that a cavity exists in the interior of the FeMo-cofactor that could be involved in substrate binding and suggest that redox reactions at the P-cluster pair may be linked to transitions of two cluster-bound sulfurs between disulfide and sulfide oxidation states."
https://openalex.org/W2117653437,"Effective chemotherapy of tuberculosis requires rapid assessment of drug sensitivity because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Drug susceptibility was assessed by a simple method based on the efficient production of photons by viable mycobacteria infected with specific reporter phages expressing the firefly luciferase gene. Light production was dependent on phage infection, expression of the luciferase gene, and the level of cellular adenosine triphosphate. Signals could be detected within minutes after infection of virulent M. tuberculosis with reporter phages. Culture of conventional strains with antituberculosis drugs, including isoniazid or rifampicin, resulted in extinction of light production. In contrast, light signals after luciferase reporter phage infection of drug-resistant strains continued to be produced. Luciferase reporter phages may help to reduce the time required for establishing antibiotic sensitivity of M. tuberculosis strains from weeks to days and to accelerate screening for new antituberculosis drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1592769050,"We recently reported that the putative tumor suppressor gene product WT1 interacts with a 5'-flanking DNA sequence 5'-GCGGGGGCG-3' within the platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene and abolishes its promoter activity, suggesting that WT1 functions as a transcriptional suppressor of the platelet-derived growth factor A-chain gene. We now show that WT1 functions also as a transcriptional activator. Using chimeric reporter plasmids, we demonstrated that WT1 requires both 5' and 3' binding sites relative to transcription start site for transcriptional repression; however, when WT1 binds to either the 5' or the 3' site alone, WT1 functions to activate transcription. We truncated the wt1 gene and established that amino acid residues 84-179 are required for transcriptional suppression, whereas amino acid residues 180-294 contain a domain that mediates transcriptional activation. These results establish that WT1 has regulatory domains that function either to activate or suppress transcription and suggest the possibility that WT1 functions as an activator and not as a suppressor of selected gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1576809876,"A novel method was developed to measure relative amounts of the GLUT4 glucose transporter on the surface of intact fat cells and to monitor the action of insulin on cell surface glucose transporters as they internalize into intracellular membranes. The method takes advantage of two predicted trypsin cleavage sites in the major exofacial loop of this transporter protein. Treatment of cyanide-poisoned rat adipocytes with 1 mg/ml trypsin at 37 degrees C for 30 min produced an immunoreactive GLUT4 protein species in subsequently isolated plasma membranes that migrated with higher mobility (apparent M(r) = 35,000) than native GLUT4 (apparent M(r) = 46,000) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This proteolyzed GLUT4 protein was absent in the intracellular low density microsomes. Insulin treatment of adipocytes for 20 min prior to sequential additions of cyanide and trypsin caused a 16-fold increase in the proteolytically cleaved GLUT4 species. Incubation of fresh fat cells with trypsin caused a rapid and progressive appearance of the proteolyzed GLUT4 species in the intracellular low density membranes as well as plasma membranes. After 5 min of trypsinization, 66% of the total cleaved GLUT4 in these cells had moved into the low density membranes. Insulin treatment markedly decreased the internalized cleaved GLUT4 to 20% of the total. These data indicate the following: 1) trypsinization of the GLUT4 transporter protein on intact fat cells is a convenient means to monitor the extent of transporter recruitment to the plasma membrane by insulin, as well as to estimate GLUT4 internalization rates; and 2) the action of insulin on glucose transporter redistribution to the cell surface is associated with a marked inhibition of the fraction of cell surface GLUT4 transporters internalized per unit time."
https://openalex.org/W1498137861,"Recent evidence has implicated ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins as critical regulators of the protein secretory pathway, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. We have examined whether Golgi membranes contain activators of ARF and the consequences of ARF activation and acylation on its membrane association. Two means were used to assess ARF activation. First, guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding to protein was found to be greater when ARF and Golgi were incubated together than when either was incubated alone. These data suggested that ARF GTP gamma S was formed. This was confirmed by showing that the GTP gamma S-bound protein functioned as a cofactor for cholera toxin-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of Gs alpha, a reaction for which activated ARF is a necessary cofactor. Trypsin treatment of Golgi, an inhibitory ARF peptide, and brefeldin A each inhibited Golgi-mediated activation by approximately 70%, demonstrating that a specific protein interaction is required for the majority of the ARF activation. This ARF-activating protein is a strong candidate for the molecular target for brefeldin A. The ubiquitous nature of ARF proteins and their importance in both the exocytic and endocytic pathways may explain the effects of brefeldin A on both exocytic and endocytic membrane traffic in animal cells. A protease-insensitive activation of ARF by Golgi could also be demonstrated and was the dominant activity observed in submicromolar concentrations of magnesium. We believe this to be the lipid-mediated process described previously for purified ARF proteins. ARF activation resulted in tight association of ARF with phospholipid vesicles. Vesicle association required amino-terminal myristoylation of ARF whereas activation did not. These studies indicate that the brefeldin A-sensitive ARF-activating protein and other factors that determine the level of activation of ARF in animal cells are fundamental regulators of membrane traffic in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581478432,"In this study, the minimal promoter requirements of the TATA-less human androgen receptor (hAR) gene promoter are described. The hAR promoter is characterized by a short GC-box (-59/-32) and a long homopurine stretch (-117/-60). Two major transcription initiation sites, AR transcription initiation site I (AR-TIS I, (+1/2/3)) and AR transcription initiation site II (AR-TIS II, (+12/13)) are located in a 13-base pair region (Faber, P. W., van Rooij, H. C. J., van der Korput, J. A. G. M., Baarends, W. M., Brinkmann, A. O., Grootegoed, J. A., and Trapman, J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10743-10749). Transient transfection of COS cells with hAR promoter deletion and mutant constructs, followed by RNA isolation and S1 nuclease protection analysis showed that the process of transcription initiation through AR-TIS I and AR-TIS II is regulated by different promoter sequences. The GC-box directed initiation from AR-TIS II but did not affect AR-TIS I utilization, which is dependent upon sequences between positions -5 and +57. Band shift analysis identified the transcription factor Sp1 as the protein interacting with the GC-box. A single Sp1 binding sequence was found to be present in the GC-box. Footprint analysis confirmed the interaction of Sp1 with this sequence. The differential initiation through AR-TIS I and AR-TIS II was substantiated by the introduction of point mutations in the Sp1 binding sequence: only mutations that specifically abolished Sp1 binding interfered with AR-TIS II utilization, but all mutations left AR-TIS I initiation intact."

https://openalex.org/W1580259448,"The substrate specificity, physico-chemical, and kinetic properties of the trans-sialidase from Trypanosoma cruzi have been investigated. The enzyme demonstrates activity towards a wide range of saccharide, glycolipid, and glycoprotein acceptors which terminate with a beta-linked galactose residue, and synthesizes exclusively an alpha 2-3 sialosidic linkage. Oligosaccharides which terminate in Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc, Gal beta 1-3(Fuc alpha 1-4)GlcNAc, or Gal alpha 1- are not acceptor-substrates. The enzyme utilizes alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid when the donor species is an oligosaccharide and can also transfer, at a low rate, sialic acid from synthetic alpha-sialosides such as p-nitrophenyl-alpha-N-acetylneuraminic acid, but NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)Glc is not a donor-substrate. The trans-sialidase has an apparent pH optimum of 7.9 and a temperature optimum of 13 degrees C. The kinetic properties of the enzyme suggest that the trans-sialylation reaction may occur via a rapid equilibrium random or steady-state ordered mechanism. A method for immobilizing the enzyme is described together with examples of its use for the synthesis of oligosaccharide and glycoprotein precursors of sialyl-Lewis and sialyl-Lewis."
https://openalex.org/W2072883428,"RNA recombination has been described for a number of viruses in the plant and animal kingdoms, but the mechanisms of selection of recombination sites are poorly understood. The nonrandom recombination between two subviral RNAs associated with turnip crinkle virus was used to study the requirement for specific sequences and structures in the generation of recombinant molecules. Single-base mutations that disrupted either the stem or the loop of one of the two computer-predicted stem-loop structures eliminated detectable recombinant molecules. However, recombinants were detected if compensatory mutations were generated that re-formed a stable hairpin structure. These results provide evidence for the necessity of specific structures in the formation of recombinant molecules in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1655426646,"The mechanism by which circulating monocytes are attracted to sites of bone remodeling is unknown. We now report that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a potent osteotrophic cytokine, was stimulatory for expression of the monocyte chemoattractant JE gene in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. TNF-alpha stimulated this JE gene expression transcriptionally. The presence of JE gene product in conditioned medium of the cytokine-treated cells was evidenced by an immunoprecipitation assay with antiserum specific for JE/MCP-1. The stimulated JE gene expression was markedly inhibited by H-7, a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced the JE gene expression, and the cytokine-induced JE gene expression was down-regulated by the phorbol ester pretreatment. TNF-alpha induced expression of both early protooncogenes, c-fos and c-jun, in the cells. Antisense oligonucleotides to these oncogenes significantly inhibited the cytokine-induced monocyte chemotactic activity. Furthermore, curcumin, a specific inhibitor of c-jun/AP-1, markedly inhibited JE gene expression and monocyte chemotactic activity induced by the cytokine. These results suggest that TNF-alpha may contribute to the regulation of remodeling and inflammation of bone tissues through the JE gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1565494103,"The VLA integrin subfamily includes receptors for extracellular matrix proteins as well as receptors involved in cell-cell adhesive interactions. We have previously described the up-regulation of VLA integrin-mediated cell attachment to different ligands by the anti-beta 1 TS2/16 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Arroyo, A. G., Sanchez-Mateos, P., Campanero, M. R., Martin-Padura, I., Dejana, E., and Sanchez-Madrid, F. (1992) J. Cell Biol. 117, 659-670). In this report, we have investigated the mechanism involved in this regulatory effect. The anti-beta 1-mediated regulatory effect on cell adhesion did not require de novo protein synthesis, since it was not affected by pretreatment with either cycloheximide or actinomycin D. To quantitate the effect of the regulatory anti-beta 1 TS2/16 mAb on the affinity of VLA-5 for its ligand, an RGD-containing fragment of fibronectin (FN80), we performed binding studies of radiolabeled soluble FN80 to U-937 cells. The affinity of VLA-5 for FN80 was enhanced about 4-fold in the presence of TS2/16 mAb (Kd = 0.98 +/- 0.07 microM) compared to the functionally irrelevant anti-beta 1 Alex 1/4 mAb (Kd = 4.23 +/- 0.92 microM), whereas no alteration in the number of binding sites was observed. Indeed, the anti-beta 1 TS2/16 mAb is inducing this high affinity state on VLA heterodimers by a direct change on the conformation of these receptors as demonstrated by affinity chromatography analysis using extracellular matrix proteins covalently bound to Sepharose. The yield of VLA-5 fibronectin receptor bound to FN80-Sepharose columns was strongly increased upon treatment of U-937 cell lysates with mAb TS2/16. Moreover, higher concentrations of EDTA were required for eluting the VLA-5 integrin from this matrix. This up-regulatory effect was also observed with F(ab')2 and Fab fragments of the anti-beta 1 TS2/16 mAb, and was also exerted on the purified VLA-5 receptor. Similarly, the yield of VLA-2 retained on a collagen I-Sepharose column was dramatically increased by pretreatment of A375 melanoma cell lysates with the mAb TS2/16. Altogether, these results indicate that the interaction of VLA beta 1 heterodimers with their ligands can be regulated by switching between differently active conformations inherent to the alpha beta 1 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1496517521,"A specific antiserum against the human m3-muscarinic receptor subtype was made by subcloning a variant region of the third intracellular loop of the m3-receptor (Ser345-Leu463) into a bacterial expression plasmid that produced a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. In immunoblot studies this anti-serum identified the human m3-receptor expressed in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (CHO-m3 cells, 1343 fmol/mg protein) as a diffuse band at approximately 97-110 kDa. In vivo labeling of the ATP pool in CHO-m3 cells with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation of solubilized m3-receptors revealed that the unstimulated receptor existed in a phosphorylated form. Incubation of CHO-m3 cells with the cholinergic agonist carbachol (1 mM) increased the phosphorylated state of the receptor dramatically, primarily at serine. The time course for agonist-dependent phosphorylation was very rapid occurring within seconds of agonist addition and was maintained for at least 30 min. The muscarinic antagonist atropine (10 microM) inhibited agonist-stimulated phosphorylation. Neither forskolin (10 microM) nor the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (1 microM), had any effect on the state of phosphorylation of the m3-receptor, eliminating a role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the agonist-dependent phosphorylation of m3-receptors. 4 beta-Phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (100 nM) did increase m3-receptor phosphorylation, an effect that was inhibited by the selective protein kinase C inhibitor RO-318220 (10 microM). However, agonist-stimulated m3-receptor phosphorylation was not inhibited by RO-318220 indicating that protein kinase C was not involved in agonist-induced m3-receptor phosphorylation. In conclusion the phosphorylation of m3-receptors, in vivo, was increased following the application of muscarinic agonist or PMA. The response to agonist was mediated via a kinase distinct from protein kinase C, protein kinase A and Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase, whereas the effect of 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate was mediated by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1535301107,"Retinoids present in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes maintained in medium containing 25 nM retinol were identified and quantitated utilizing reverse-phase gradient high performance liquid chromatography. Total cell retinoid mass and composition averaged 12.59 pmol/mg cell protein +/- 1.86, (mean +/- S.D., n = 5) between strains and was constant with culture age. Long chain fatty acid esters of retinol and 3,4-didehydroretinol comprised greater than 95% of total retinoid, each contributing 77 and 23% of total esters, respectively. In mature stratified cultures, less abundant retinoids included unesterified retinol, 1%, and 3,4-didehydroretinol, 0.5%, retinoic acid, 0.5%, and a retinoid not previously reported in mammalian cells, 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid, 0.3%. This absolute and relative retinoid composition was essentially constant with culture age except that 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid was not detected in 3-4-day-old cultures (16-32 cell colonies), suggesting that keratinocyte differentiation may be related to endogenous changes in production of active retinoids. Separate pools of retinyl and 3,4-didehydroretinyl esters served as predominant sources of substrate for production of retinoic and 3,4-didehydroretinoic acids, respectively, suggesting that their production may be regulated independently."
https://openalex.org/W1933321051,"Both the enzymes of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation and the liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) are induced in the liver by peroxisome proliferators, such as clofibrate (CF), as well as high fat diets. One proposed mechanism for this induction is that it represents an adaptive response to altered intracellular fatty acid fluxes, mediated by dicarboxylic fatty acids formed via the cytochrome P-450IVA1 omega-oxidation pathway. The studies presented in this paper were designed to investigate the role of the products of P-450IVA1 omega-oxidation in the regulation of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and L-FABP. In primary hepatocyte cultures exposed to CF, the increase in P-450IVA1 activity preceded the induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation and L-FABP. The CF-mediated increases in peroxisomal beta-oxidation and L-FABP, but not P-450IVA1, could be significantly inhibited pretranslationally by concurrent exposure of cultured hepatocytes to inactivators of cytochromes P-450, such as 1-aminobenzotriazole and 10-undecynoic acid. Hexadecanedioic acid, a 16-carbon dicarboxylic fatty acid, that is poorly metabolized in hepatocytes, induced peroxisomal beta-oxidation and L-FABP, but not P-450IVA1, via a pretranslational mechanism that was not inhibited by 1-aminobenzotriazole. Long-chain monocarboxylic acids were without such inducing effect. In further studies, non-beta-oxidizable dicarboxylic acid analogs were found to display greater potency as inducers of peroxisomal beta-oxidation when compared to hexadecanedioic acid. The inducing effects of the dicarboxylic acid analogs were also independent of the P-450 omega-oxidation pathway. The results of these studies suggest that the regulation of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and L-FABP is mediated, to a significant extent, by poorly metabolized long-chain dicarboxylic acids formed via the P-450IVA1 pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1536730362,"The three-dimensional structures of the ligand-binding domain of the wild-type Salmonella typhimurium aspartate receptor have been determined in the absence (apo) and presence of bound aspartate (complex) and compared to a cross-linked mutant containing a cysteine at position 36 which does not change signaling behavior of the intact receptor. The structures of the wild-type forms were determined in order to assess the effects of cross-linking on the structure and its influence on conformational changes upon ligand binding. As in the case of the cross-linked mutant receptor, the non-cross-linked ligand-binding domain is dimeric and is composed of 4-alpha-helical bundle monomer subunits related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis in the unbound form and by a non-crystallographic axis in the aspartate-bound form. A comparative study between the non-cross-linked and cross-linked structures has led to the following observations: 1) The long N-terminal helices of the individual subunits in the cross-linked structures are bent toward each other to accommodate the disulfide bond. 2) The rest of the subunit conformation is very similar to that of the wild-type. 3) The intersubunit angle of the cross-linked apo structure is larger by about 13 degrees when compared to the wild-type apo structure. 4) The nature and magnitude of the aspartate-induced conformational changes in the non-cross-linked wild-type structures are very similar to those of the cross-linked structures."
https://openalex.org/W1507061989,"The mammalian enzyme protein farnesyltransferase is a heterodimeric protein that catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl isoprenoid to a cysteine in ras proteins. Since oncogenic forms of ras proteins require the farnesyl group for transforming activity, the structure and mechanism of this enzyme are important to define. However, such studies have been difficult to approach because of the low abundance of the enzyme in mammalian tissues and hence the problems of obtaining large quantities of the protein. We report here the co-expression of the two subunits of protein farnesyltransferase by Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the coding sequences of both polypeptides. This results in the production of milligram quantities of enzyme which can be readily purified by conventional chromatographic methods. The individual subunits of the enzyme can also be expressed in the Sf9 cells, but the ability to reconstitute active enzyme from extracts containing individual subunits is quite low. In contrast, the enzyme produced by co-expression of the two subunits is fully active and retains the properties of the mammalian form, including the specificity for the COOH-terminal amino acid of substrate proteins and the ability to bind short peptides encompassing the prenylation site of a ras protein. Furthermore, through atomic absorption analysis of the purified protein, we have confirmed the previous tentative assignment of protein farnesyltransferase as a zinc metalloenzyme by demonstrating that it contains an essentially stoichiometric amount of zinc. The ability to produce and purify milligram quantities of protein farnesyltransferase readily will allow detailed mechanistic and structural studies on this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1540101541,"The mouse 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) and Ca(2+)-calmodulin were cross-linked at an equimolar ratio using a carbodiimide zero-length cross-linker. To identify the calmodulin-binding domain(s) of HSP90, CNBr-cleaved peptide fragments of HSP90 were mixed with Ca(2+)-calmodulin and cross-linked. Amino acid sequence determination revealed that an HSP90 alpha-derived peptide starting at the 486th amino acid residue was contained in the cross-linked products, which contains a calmodulin-binding motif (from Lys500 to Ile520). A similar motif is present also in HSP90 beta (from Lys491 to Val511). The synthetic peptides corresponding to these putative calmodulin-binding sequences were found to be cross-linked with Ca(2+)-calmodulin and to prevent the cross-linking of HSP90 and Ca(2+)-calmodulin. Both HSP90 alpha and HSP90 beta bind Ca2+. The HSP90 peptides bind HSP90 and thereby inhibit the binding of Ca2+. In addition, the HSP90 peptides augment the self-oligomerization of HSP90 induced at elevated temperatures. These results suggest that the calmodulin-binding domain of HSP90 might interact with another part of the same molecule and that Ca(2+)-calmodulin might modulate the structure and function of HSP90 through abolishing the intramolecular interaction."
https://openalex.org/W82097804,"Bone resorption requires cooperation between osteoclasts and mononuclear accessory cells by mechanisms which have not been elucidated. Since multinucleated cells in giant cell tumors of bone have many phenotypic and functional characteristics of normal osteoclasts, we have examined the interaction between the bone-resorbing multinucleated cells and the distinct mononuclear stromal cells from these tumors. We have found that these mononuclear cells produce an activity which stimulates both giant cells from giant cell tumors and rodent osteoclasts to resorb bone in vitro. We have identified the activity and found that it represents several products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, namely 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and the leukotrienes. These data indicate that 5-lipoxygenase metabolites stimulate isolated osteoclasts to resorb bone in vitro and may represent a mechanism by which mononuclear stromal cells in human giant cell tumors communicate with the giant cells. In addition, these results may explain a possible mechanism for communication between accessory cells and osteoclasts involved in normal bone resorption."
https://openalex.org/W1556021718,"The influence of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) on the dynamics of microtubule assembly and disassembly from axonemal fragments was characterized in vitro in solutions of pure tubulin and varying concentrations of MAP2. A mechanistic description of interactions between MAP2 and individual microtubules was developed from analysis of recorded images obtained by video-enhanced differential-interference-contrast light microscopy. MAP2 decreased the rates and lengths of shortening events and decreased the frequency of transitions between growth and shortening over a wide range of concentrations, thereby producing the increases in net microtubule growth previously described by light-scattering techniques. Increases in rates and lengths of elongation phases, as well as rescue frequencies (i.e. transition from shortening to growth), were observed under conditions in which microtubules are expected to be saturated with MAP2. During early stages of nucleated assembly, MAP2 greatly increased the number of microtubules growing from a given axoneme and caused elongation of curved structures which may be sheet-like microtubules."

https://openalex.org/W1531514263,"We have previously noted a 50-kDa polypeptide (p50) co-purifying with preparations of the bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicle vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) (Zhang, J., Myers, M., and Forgac, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9773-9778). We show that p50 is also immunoprecipitated with the V-ATPase, further suggesting its specific association with the proton pump. To determine the identity of this 50-kDa polypeptide and the stoichiometry of its association with the V-ATPase, we performed N-terminal amino acid sequencing and quantitative amino acid analysis of the gel-purified protein. These results revealed the unknown polypeptide to be the 50-kDa subunit of the clathrin assembly protein AP-2 (AP50); we estimate the stoichiometry of association is one AP50 per V-ATPase complex. AP50 is an N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-inhibitable autokinase and incubation of purified V-ATPase with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in the NEM-sensitive phosphorylation of AP50 and the B subunit of the V-ATPase. The same phosphorylation pattern is seen if the labeling reaction is done with intact clathrin-coated vesicles and the V-ATPase subsequently immunoprecipitated from the solubilized vesicles. This represents the first report of phosphorylation of one of the V-ATPase subunits. The functional significance of this phosphorylation for regulation or targeting of the V-ATPase in vivo remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1678204546,"We have investigated the ability of the nucleotides GTP, CTP, and 1-N6-etheno-2-aza-ATP (aza-ATP) to support contraction of chemically skinned rabbit psoas fibers. Working at 10 degrees C, millimolar concentrations of all nucleotides relaxed fibers in the absence of calcium. In active fibers, GTP served as a very poor substrate with isometric tension, isometric GTPase rate, and maximum shortening velocity (Vmax) all less than 10% of those obtained with ATP. Aza-ATP was only a slightly better substrate. CTP, on the other hand, was an effective substrate with mechanical parameters which were 65-100% those obtained with ATP, and with a hydrolysis rate that exceeded that of ATP. For all three ligands, Vmax followed Michaelis-Menten saturation behavior with values for Km which were from 2.5 to 12 times greater than that for ATP, showing that the analogs bound slowly to myosin in the fibers. Increasing concentrations of orthophosphate inhibited tension with CTP, to a lesser extent with aza-ATP, but not all with GTP. A combination of the mechanical data obtained in fibers with the kinetic data obtained in solution (White, H.D., Belknap, B., and Jiang, W. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 10039-10045) is used to better define the actomyosin interaction in fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1491835584,"Endo-alpha-D-mannosidase is a Golgi-located processing enzyme that achieves deglucosylation of N-linked carbohydrate units through its unique property of cleaving the oligosaccharide chain internally with the release of glucose-substituted mannose (Glc1-3Man). By chemically modifying the characteristic disaccharide product, Glc alpha 1-->3Man, a number of potent inhibitors of the endomannosidase were obtained, foremost among which were Glc alpha 1-->3(1-deoxy)mannojirimycin (Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ) and Glc alpha 1-->3(1,2-dideoxy)mannose (IC50 = 1.7 and 3.8 microM, respectively), which, while blocking the in vitro action of the enzyme, had negligible effect on other endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi-processing glycosidases. Although preparation of a large number of Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ derivatives did not yield a more effective endomannosidase inhibitor it provided valuable information relating to the structural requirements for the enzyme-substrate interaction. Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ was found to be active not only on rat liver endomannosidase but also on the enzyme from a number of other sources including mouse lymphoma (BW5147.3), HepG2, baby hamster kidney, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines. When tested in vivo in lymphoma and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells during a castanospermine-imposed glucosidase blockade, Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ interrupted the endomannosidase processing pathway as evident from a concomitant inhibition of complex oligosaccharide formation and Glc3Man release; similarly the capacity of the glucosidase II-deficient mouse lymphoma cell line (PHAR2.7) to synthesize complex oligosaccharides was blocked by Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ. Endomannosidase could not be detected in Chinese hamster ovary cells by in vitro assay and consistent with this these cells produced only glucosylated polymannose N-linked oligosaccharides during glucosidase blockade. It would appear that by acting in conjunction with a glucosidase inhibitor, Glc alpha 1-->3DMJ and related endomannosidase-blocking agents could have the potential of influencing the exit of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum and interfering with viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W1594871899,"Immense quantities of chitin are catabolized by marine bacteria, and this process involves at least three signal transduction systems in Vibrio furnissii. One system, chemotaxis to chitin oligosaccharides, is probably used to colonize chitin particles. But how do the first few cells find this highly insoluble polysaccharide? The following hypothesis is proposed to answer this question: the bacteria respond to soluble chemo-attractants in exudates from injured organisms. Virtually all chitin-producing organisms also contain glucose and/or trehalose, often at high concentrations such as trehalose in insect hemolymph. Chemotaxis of V. furnissii was therefore studied with a variety of sugars. Fructose, ribose, and glycerol are catabolites but not attractants. The cells exhibit weak constitutive taxis to Glc and GlcNAc. After induction, they show a weak response to galactose but are strongly attracted to the following substrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS): GlcNAc, trehalose, glucose, sucrose, mannose, and mannitol. There is a rough qualitative but no quantitative correlation between the rate of phosphorylation and the chemotactic response to PTS sugars. Trehalose is especially noteworthy because it is phosphorylated at a very rapid rate by uninduced cells but is not an attractant until the cells are induced. We suggest that unidentified inducible factors link the PTS to chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W1490148501,"Transcription of the genes required for utilization of galactose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled primarily by the transcriptional activator protein GAL4. The upstream activating sequences for galactose (UASG) of most GAL genes have multiple sites to which GAL4 can bind. In this report we compare the binding properties of wild type GAL4 and derivatives of GAL4 bearing the N-terminal DNA-binding domain to multiple DNA-binding sites in vitro. To produce wild type GAL4, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus for expression in insect cells. Recombinant wild type GAL4 was found to bind efficiently to an oligonucleotide containing a near-consensus 17-mer GAL4 DNA-binding site in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Footprinting experiments revealed that wild type GAL4 binds cooperatively to the four GAL4 DNA-binding sites of the GAL1-10 UASG; however, in contrast an N-terminal fragment of GAL4 containing only the DNA-binding/dimerization domains binds to each of these sites with slightly different affinity. With increasing concentrations of GAL4(1-147), the four sites become filled in the following order: site II, site IV, site I, and site III. In experiments with wild type GAL4, these four sites become fully occupied at approximately the same concentration of protein. In footprints of wild type GAL4 on the USAG, enhancements and protections of DNase I-sensitive cleavages are detectable between sites III and IV, indicative of formation of a loop between these distantly spaced sites. Binding of wild type GAL4 to a strong near-consensus binding site assists binding to an adjacent mutant site in both electrophoretic mobility shift and footprinting assays. GAL4(1-147) and GAL4(1-147) fused to portions of GAL4's activating region II were incapable of cooperative DNA binding in our assays. We conclude from these observations that wild type GAL4 has a cooperative DNA-binding function that is distinct from the DNA binding and dimerization or transcriptional activation functions, and likely plays and important role in precise regulation of GAL gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1520718345,"The trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) is anchored to the outer leaflet of the parasite plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI). The VSG anchor is unique among GPIs in containing exclusively dimyristoylglycerol as its lipid moiety. Myristate is incorporated into the anchor precursor by sequential deacylation and specific reacylation with myristate. Although myristate is required for the VSG anchor, trypanosomes cannot synthesize this fatty acid and must import their entire supply from the host bloodstream, where it exists in low abundance. Chemical analysis of these parasites reveals that most of their myristate is in VSG protein, with no major lipid storage form. Unexpectedly, when these cells are radiolabeled with [3H]myristate in culture, most of the label is incorporated into phospholipids, with little into VSG. This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that trypanosomes in culture medium elongate much of the [3H]myristate into palmitate and stearate, probably because the medium (with only 5% serum) contains limiting amounts of these fatty acids. In contrast, trypanosomes radiolabeled in whole blood (with higher concentrations of palmitate and stearate) do not modify most of the [3H]myristate, and instead utilize the major portion of it for GPI synthesis. Our studies suggest that bloodstream trypanosomes have evolved highly efficient means of directing myristate into the GPI biosynthetic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1647631061,"The production of alpha-amidated peptides is accomplished through the sequential action of two enzymes, peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) and peptidyl-alpha-hydroxyglycine alpha-amidating lyase (PAL), that are contained within the bifunctional peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) protein. Tissue-specific alternative splicing and endoproteolysis are known to generate both soluble and integral membrane mono- and bifunctional PAM proteins. In order to investigate the functional consequences of these differences we purified PAM-3, a soluble 95-kDa bifunctional form of the enzyme, from the spent medium of stably transfected hEK-293 cells. Using NH2-terminal sequence analysis of products of limited endoproteolysis and antibody cross-reactivity we identified protease-sensitive regions at the NH2 terminus, between the 35-kDa PHM and 42-kDa PAL domains and at the COOH terminus of the protein. Endoproteolytic removal of the COOH-terminal region from the bifunctional PAM-3 protein shifted the pH optimum of PHM to a more alkaline pH, increased the turnover number (kappa(cat)) of PHM and decreased its KM for alpha-N-acetyl-Tyr-Val-Gly; the catalytic properties of PAL were not altered. Since peptide amidation can be a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of neuropeptides, similar increases in PHM activity in vivo may play an important role in regulating the extent of peptide alpha-amidation."
https://openalex.org/W1495847993,"We have discovered a soluble form of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha receptor, designated sPDGF-R alpha, that is produced by and secreted into the conditioned medium of the human osteosarcoma cell line, MG-63. Additionally, sPDGF-R alpha activity has been detected in normal human blood plasma and serum. We have achieved partial purification of this protein by column chromatography using three different affinity matrices: anti-PDGF-R alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb) 292.15-Sepharose, PDGF-BB-Sepharose, and wheat germ agglutinin-agarose. All three matrices have been shown to purify a 90-kDa protein that is recognized by mAbs specific for the PDGF-R alpha extracellular domain. sPDGF-R alpha is capable of binding PDGF ligand in solution and can compete with cell-associated PDGF receptors for ligand binding. We provide three pieces of data suggesting that the sPDGF-R alpha is generated by proteolytic clipping of the full-length PDGF-R alpha protein. First, the conditioned medium of an expression cell line transfected with a cDNA construct designed to produce only full-length PDGF-R alpha exhibits sPDGF-R alpha activity. Second, a truncated intracellular fragment of the PDGF-R alpha, presumably representing the intracellular counterpart of the clipped sPDGF-R alpha, can be immunoprecipitated from the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell extracts using antiserum raised against an intracellular portion of PDGF-R alpha. Finally, we have been unable to detect alternative splicing in the PDGF-R alpha transcript using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1521944271,"We have examined the effects of positively and negatively charged residues on the translocation of outer membrane protein A precursor (pro-OmpA) across the bacterial inner membrane. Pro-OmpA does not translocate across the membrane when 2 positively charged residues are inserted immediately after the leader peptide, whereas it does insert when 2 neutral or negatively charged residues are introduced. Using a cell-free translocation system, we show that the membrane potential stimulated the rate of initial insertion of pro-OmpA with negatively charged residues, inhibited pro-OmpA with positively charged residues, and had no effect on neutral pro-OmpA. Thus, acidic residues render pro-OmpA potential-dependent for loop formation, which then initiates the translocation process."
https://openalex.org/W1548141954,"We present the first presteady state kinetic analysis of an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent enzyme. The target enzyme is the bacterial EcoRI DNA methyl-transferase, which transfers the methyl group to the second adenine in the DNA sequence GAATTC. The rate constant for conversion of the central complex (enzyme-DNA-S-adenosylmethionine) to products (enzyme-methylated DNA-S-adenosylhomocysteine) (41 +/- 7 s-1) is over 300-fold faster than kcat, consistent with our demonstration that steps after methyl transfer are rate-limiting (Reich, N. O., and Mashhoon, N. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 2933-2939). Methyl transfer at the N6 amino moiety of adenine on each strand requires a single binding orientation."
https://openalex.org/W1583519276,"We have isolated an alternative transcript of the rat Gs alpha signal transduction protein gene, referred to as Gs alpha N1. Gs alpha N1 was isolated by differential hybridization screening of genes induced upon dexamethasone treatment of the neuronal-like CA77 rat thyroid C-cell line. The 1-kilobase Gs alpha N1 transcript is generated by alternative splicing and polyadenylation of a novel terminal exon. This exon lies 800 base pairs downstream of exon 3 in the Gs alpha gene. Dexamethasone differentially induced Gs alpha N1 severalfold relative to Gs alpha mRNA in the CA77 cells, similar to the bias seen with alternative processing of the calcitonin/calcitonin gene-related peptide transcript. In addition to the differential regulation by dexamethasone, the expression pattern of Gs alpha N1 in rat tissues differed markedly from Gs alpha. Gs alpha N1 mRNA was much more abundant in the brain, with intermediate levels in skeletal muscle and very low levels in other tissues. This was in contrast to the more ubiquitously expressed Gs alpha mRNA. Within the brain, Gs alpha N1 was particularly abundant in discrete regions of the brainstem and hypothalamus that modulate autonomic functions. Examination of rat embryos demonstrated that Gs alpha is expressed in both brain and nonneural tissue at least 1 day before Gs alpha N1 mRNA could be detected in the embryonic brain. Based on the regulated expression of the Gs alpha N1 transcript and previous studies on G alpha proteins, the predicted Gs alpha N1 protein may potentially modulate several heterotrimeric G protein functions in the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1638373916,"The flux control coefficients of adenine nucleotide translocase, the phosphate transporter, and H(+)-ATPase were determined in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria using glutamate plus malate as substrates and soluble F1-ATPase as load enzyme. It was observed that the flux control coefficients of adenine nucleotide translocase, H(+)-ATPase, and the load enzyme F1-ATPase, at comparable rates of respiration, strongly depend on the phosphate concentration in the incubation medium. So, the flux control exerted by adenine nucleotide translocase, in the intermediate states of mitochondrial respiration (approximately 120 nmol of O2/min/mg) at 10 mM phosphate, was found to be about 0.37. At a phosphate concentration of 1 mM and comparable rates of respiration the flux control coefficient of the translocase decreased to about 0.20. Under these conditions, a sharp increase in the controlling influence of H(+)-ATPase from 0.10 to 0.74 was detected. Furthermore, at this flux rate, the sum of flux control coefficients of adenine nucleotide translocase, H(+)-ATPase, phosphate transporter, and the load enzyme F1-ATPase was noted to be very close to unity. This indicates that under the conditions of intermediate state respiration, all of the other reactions have a negligible controlling influence on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1605885087,"To analyze the relationship between c-myc gene expression and chondrocyte proliferation and maturation during endochondral ossification, Day 18-19 chick embryo sterna were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine, and serial sections were processed for autoradiography and in situ hybridization. Proliferating chondrocytes, located in four distinct areas of the developing sternum, all contained high levels of c-myc transcripts, whereas postmitotic chondrocytes (such as hypertrophic chondrocytes) contained undetectable amounts. These findings were confirmed by Northern blot analysis and by the observation that antisense c-myc oligomer treatment inhibited proliferation in cultured chondrocytes. Constitutive overexpression of c-myc by retroviral vectors in immature chondrocyte cultures (c-myc cultures) maintained the cells in a proliferative state and blocked their maturation into hypertrophic chondrocytes. The lack of maturation in the c-myc cultures was corroborated by analysis of type X collagen gene regulation. Control immature cultures contained strong repressor activity for the type X collagen gene promoter, as revealed by transfection assays; repressor activity was lost upon maturation and activation of type X collagen synthesis. In the c-myc cultures, however, repressor activity persisted. Thus, c-myc participates in the normal changes in proliferation accompanying chondrocyte maturation in vivo and in culture. The decreases in c-myc expression and cell proliferation appear to be required for completion of maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1485208132,"We previously reported that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) stimulated calcium entry (Kojima, I., Matsunaga, H., Kurokawa, K., Ogata, E., and Nishimoto, I. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16561-16567) and production of 1,2-diacylglycerol in IGF-responsive Balb/c 3T3 cells (Kojima, I., Kitaoka, M., and Ogata, E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16846-16850). The present study was conducted to determine a role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the progression activity of IGF-I. To monitor the activity of PKC in intact cells, we measured phosphorylation of a synthetic KRTLRR peptide, a substrate of PKC, immediately after the permeabilization of the cells with digitonin. When 1 nM IGF-I was added to primed competent cells, KRTLRR peptide phosphorylation was augmented. IGF-I induced more than 2-fold increase in KRTLRR peptide phosphorylation that was blocked by PKC19-36, a pseudosubstrate of PKC, which blocks the activity of the kinase, and Ro31-8220, an inhibitor of PKC. The phosphorylation remained elevated for up to 6 h. To assess the role of PKC in cell cycle progression, IGF-I-induced nuclear labeling was measured in the presence of Ro31-8220. Ro31-8220 reduced the rate of entrance into S phase when added in the first quarter of the G1 phase, but did not affect cell cycle progression when added at the second quarter or later. In contrast, reduction of extracellular calcium completely blocked cell cycle progression when done in the first, second, and third quarter but had no effect in the last quarter. These results indicate that IGF-I persistently activates PKC in primed competent cells, but the activation is required only for the initiation of progression. We conclude that IGF-I promotes cell cycle progression by calcium-dependent mechanisms that are largely independent of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W2155236033,"Lysosomal accumulation of unesterified (free) cholesterol, following the phagocytic incorporation of cholesteryl oleate lipid droplets, was quantitatively characterized in a murine J774 macrophage foam cell model. The induction of phagocytic incorporation by the macrophages, using an inverted culture technique, allowed the rapid delivery of large amounts of cholesteryl ester droplets to the lysosomes, leading to the subsequent generation of free cholesterol. The lysosomally generated free cholesterol was differentiated from the membrane cholesterol by a double radiolabeling procedure. Free cholesterol accumulation was quantitated in a population of low density lipid-filled lysosomes prepared by ultracentrifugal isolation of a floating lipid fraction from a homogenate of the cholesteryl ester-loaded cells. About 10% of the total N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activity, a lysosomal marker, was recovered in the lipid fraction. Negligible amounts of alkaline phosphodiesterase-1, a plasma membrane marker, or membrane cholesterol were present in this fraction. Electron microscopic and cytochemical analysis of the isolated lipid fraction revealed the presence of lysosomes in the fraction with a diameter ranging from 1.5 to 4 microns. Continued hydrolysis of incorporated cholesteryl ester over a 24-h incubation resulted in approximately 30% of the generated free cholesterol in lipid-filled lysosomes. The accumulation of free cholesterol occurred whether or not the cholesterol esterifying enzyme, acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase, was inhibited. In addition, substantial amounts of free cholesterol accumulated even in the presence of efficient cholesterol acceptor particles, apolipoprotein high density lipoprotein-phosphatidylcholine complexes which stimulate cholesterol efflux. Also, increased accumulation of free cholesterol in the lipid fraction was observed when cholesteryl ester-loaded cells were treated with the compound U-18666A which blocks the movement of lysosomal cholesterol. The data demonstrate that the phagocytic incorporation and hydrolysis of cholesteryl ester lipid droplets by macrophage foam cells lead to a substantial accumulation of free cholesterol in the lipid-filled lysosomes. This process could result in a build-up of lysosomal free cholesterol in macrophage foam cells during the progression of atherosclerotic plaque."
https://openalex.org/W1481497597,"2'-Hydroxybenzalpyruvate aldolase catalyzes the cleavage of 2'-hydroxybenzalpyruvate to salicylaldehyde and pyruvate. This reaction is part of the degradative pathways for naphthalene and naphthalenesulfonates by bacteria. 2'-Hydroxybenzalpyruvate aldolase has been purified to homogeneity from a bacterium that degrades naphthalenesulfonates (strain BN6). The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 120,000 and is composed of identical subunits with a molecular weight of about 38,500. Thus the enzyme appears to exist as a trimeric oligomer. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence did not show significant homology to other published amino acid sequences. Extensive loss of enzyme activity occurred when the enzyme was incubated with 2'-hydroxybenzalpyruvate in the presence of sodium borhydride. This suggested the intermediate formation of a stable Schiff base between enzyme and substrate. 2'-Hydroxybenzalpyruvate aldolase was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and by the reaction product salicylaldehyde. The enzyme converted 2'-hydroxybenzalpyruvate, 2',4'- and 2',6'-dihydroxybenzalpyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1492015357,"The mechanism of spermidine-induced destabilization of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) was examined in newly isolated ODC-overproducing variant cells by use of an in vitro ODC degrading system. The cells accumulated ODC protein in the presence of alpha-difluoromethylornithine. Addition of spermidine to the medium accelerated degradation of ODC protein concomitantly with induction of antizyme, a regulatory protein that binds to ODC, inhibiting its activity. Both the acceleration of ODC degradation and the induction of antizyme were inhibited by cycloheximide, but not by actinomycin D. ODC was degraded rapidly in extracts from spermidine-treated cells. The rate of ODC degradation correlated with the amount of antizyme in the extracts, and the degradation activity was abolished by treatment of the extracts with anti-antizyme antibody. Thus, antizyme induced by spermidine was essential for the accelerated degradation of ODC in the cells. ODC was phosphorylated in the cells, probably at serine residue 303 in the first internal PEST region. ODC phosphorylation occurred even when its new synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Antizyme accelerated the degradations of both dephosphorylated ODC and native ODC."
https://openalex.org/W1489703514,"Abstract The recycling of plasma membrane glycoproteins to the Golgi complex is well established, but it is not clear which Golgi subcompartments receive this traffic. To date, recycling into the trans-Golgi compartment that contains sialyltransferase and the early Golgi region that contains alpha-mannosidase I has been demonstrated. However, transport into other Golgi compartments has not been reported. In this study we tested the return of cell surface glycoproteins to the Golgi galactosyltransferase compartment using the ldlD mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor recycled through this Golgi region with a half-time of 4 h and was transported to the sialyltransferase compartment as well. Because galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferases are probably located in different trans-Golgi regions in Chinese hamster ovary cells, these results suggest that the two compartments each receive recycling traffic or that recycling glycoproteins enter one region and are then transported to the other. The extent of cell surface protein recycling through the galactosyltransferase compartment was also studied. At least 10 different glycoproteins were transported from the cell surface to this Golgi region. Moreover, our results suggest that recycling glycoproteins make up 12-25% of the flux of cell surface glycoproteins through the Golgi galactosyltransferase compartment; the balance is comprised of newly made glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1491279917,"Abstract Anthracycline antibiotics (notably daunorubicin (DAU) and doxorubicin (DOX)) and nucleoside analog arabinosylcytosine (araC or aC) are important anticancer drugs. They are sometimes used together in the treatment of certain cancers. Both classes of compounds act by blocking DNA replication and transcription. To probe whether both drugs can be incorporated simultaneously into DNA and the possible structural consequences, we carried out x-ray diffraction analyses of the complexes between DAU/DOX and araC-containing DNA hexamers cross-linked with formaldehyde. The crystal structures were determined to high resolution (DAU-CGaCGCG, 1.2 A, space group P4(1)2(1)2, R = 0.182, 3275 reflections; DOX-CAaCGTG, 1.5 A, space group C2, R = 0.175, 3359 reflections), and they are similar to those of the previously studied DAU- and DOX-DNA complexes, despite different crystal packings. Two DAU/DOX molecules intercalate at both ends of the helix with their amino sugars in the minor groove. As in the structure of DAU-CGCGCG (Wang, A.H.-J., Gao, Y.-G., Liaw, Y.-C., and Li, Y.K. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3812-3815), a covalent methylene bridge (from formaldehyde) between the N3' of daunosamine and the N2 of the guanine is formed in both adducts. In DOX-CAaCGTG, the two halves are slightly different with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.322 A between them. The O14 hydroxyls of the intercalated DOXs are within hydrogen bond distances to the O2P atoms of the A2p(aC3) and A8p(AC9) steps. The O2'-hydroxyl group from araC does not affect the binding of DAU-DOX or the conformation of the drug-DNA complexes. The results suggest that three major drug modifications on DNA, i.e., intercalation, covalent bond formation, and nucleoside analog incorporation, can coexist in the same DNA molecule without difficulty. When they occur in close proximity in DNA, they may provide an additive inhibitory effect for the target enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1554886997,"To characterize the mechanism of membrane attachment of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an expression system producing the processed form of this enzyme has been developed. We have replaced the endogenous signal peptide of bovine dopamine beta-hydroxylase with a heterologous signal peptide which is efficiently recognized and cleaved in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells. A cDNA encoding this chimeric recombinant bovine enzyme has been stably transfected into Schneider 2 cells. The inducible expression of active dopamine beta-hydroxylase in these cells has been verified by Western blotting and enzyme activity assays. N-terminal sequence analysis of purified recombinant enzyme demonstrates complete removal of the signal peptide. Subcellular analysis shows that the recombinant enzyme exists as both a soluble and a membrane-bound form in these cells. These data demonstrate that the endogenous signal peptide is not required for the formation of the membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase and further that the enzyme can be bound to membranes via a mechanism other than uncleaved signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1896605669,"Tau protein is a phosphorylated neuronal microtubule-associated protein. Tau protein is also present in the major pathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease in an insoluble hyperphosphorylated state as paired helical filaments (PHFs). We have investigated the phosphorylation state of control taus and a fragment of PHF-tau. Tau samples were digested with protease, separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry and Edman microsequencing. The serine homologous with S404 of human tau 441 was phosphorylated on bovine and porcine tau and up to two phosphates were present on a peptide of amino acids 182-240 of bovine tau (193-251 of human tau 441). The serine within the KSPV motif was not phosphorylated on bovine or porcine tau. PHF-tau fragments, isolated from pronase-treated PHFs encompassed a 93-amino acid region within the microtubule binding domain. Enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis showed no phosphate was present and a second carboxyl terminus was identified at E380. Antibodies T3P and SMI34, which recognize PHF-tau and peptides phosphorylated at the sequence KSPV, both reacted with bovine and porcine tau even though the KSPV sequence was not phosphorylated. These data indicate that the 93-amino acid sequence of F5.5 tau from PHFs is not phosphorylated, and the serine equivalent to S404 of human tau is phosphorylated in bovine and porcine tau. Antibodies T3P and SMI34 react with phosphorylated epitopes that are not unique to PHF-tau and that are not necessarily at the KSPV site."
https://openalex.org/W1550302286,"Human tumor necrosis factor is initially synthesized as a transmembrane prohormone anchored by a hydrophobic region of the leader sequence. This hydrophobic domain has been previously localized to extend from Leu-46 to Ile-21 based on hydropathy calculations. To functionally determine the nature of this domain, we have generated a series of pro-TNF mutant cDNAs in which either half or both halves of this encoding domain is deleted. These cDNAs were analyzed both by the ability of their mRNAs to direct translation in a microsomal system and by cellular localization of their encoded TNFs following transfection of NIH/3T3 cells. We determined that the mutant protein with deletion of the periluminal region of the transmembrane domain (Thr-32 to Ile-21) was translocated into microsomes and localized on the inner surface of the microsomal membrane in a fashion identical to that of the parental TNF. In contrast, the mutants with deletion of either the pericytoplasmic aspect (Leu-46 to Gly-34) or of virtually the entire transmembrane domain were not localized in the microsomes. Transfection experiments indicated that only the cDNAs whose peptide products were translocated across microsomal membranes gave rise to transmembrane prohormones and matured TNFs. Thus, the functions of membrane targeting and orientation prior to proteolytic processing can be fulfilled by the sequence Leu-46 to Ala-33 of the transmembrane domain, but not by the sequence Ala-33 to Ile-21."
https://openalex.org/W1603573837,"Rat C-reactive protein (CRP) is a pentameric glycoprotein composed of five apparently identical monomers, two of which form a disulfide-linked dimer (Rasosouli, M., Sambasivam, H., Azadi, P., Dell, A., Morris, H. R., Nagpurkar, A., Mookerjea, S., and Murray, R. K. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2947-2954). In this study, the nature of the oligosaccharide chain of rat CRP was investigated by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), and general features of its biosynthetic pathway were also analyzed. FAB-MS, electrospray-mass spectrometry, and linkage analysis demonstrated that each monomer of rat CRP contained one oligosaccharide chain, predominantly a disialylated biantennary structure, attached to Asn-128. The biosynthesis of rat CRP was studied by immunoprecipitation of CRP synthesized in vitro and by cultured hepatocytes. The results revealed that each monomer of rat CRP was synthesized individually as a single-chain precursor with a cleavable signal sequence. The translocated species was sensitive to digestion by endoglycosidase H (endo H), indicating that it possessed a high mannose oligosaccharide. Rat CRP acquired the ability to bind to phosphorylcholine-Sepharose and to form the dimeric and oligomeric species prior to acquiring resistance to endo H. Studies using tunicamycin revealed that the N-linked oligosaccharide present in rat CRP was not required for formation of its dimeric component, oligomerization, ability to bind to phosphorylcholine, or secretion. The non-glycosylated rat CRP, however, was still able to bind to phosphorylcholine-Sepharose and to be secreted by hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1556690032,"A pedigree of transgenic mice has been characterized that contains a H2-Kb/LacZ fusion gene that exhibits integration site-dependent expression from the earliest stages of lung development through adulthood. Histochemical and immunocytochemical studies indicate that the LacZ reporter appears throughout the pulmonary endoderm by embryonic day 11 (E11). A proximal-to-distal wave of extinction of transgene expression occurs during E13-14 that parallels the wave of cytodifferentiation of the pulmonary endoderm. By E16, the LacZ reporter is restricted to the distal portion of epithelial tubules and by birth to scattered cells located in alveoli. Crude epithelial cell suspensions were prepared from lungs harvested from E16 and 14 day postnatal transgenic mice, labeled with the fluorescent LacZ substrate fluorescein di-(beta-galactopyranoside), and the LacZ expressing population isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Electron microscopic, immunocytochemical and histochemical studies of this purified cell population establish that type II pneumocytes are the only cell lineage that support H2-Kb/LacZ expression in the mature postnatal lung. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of E16 lung suspensions yielded a homogeneous population of cells that produced surfactant protein A, that could be maintained in cell culture, and that are likely precursors of adult type II pneumocytes. Together these studies indicate that (i) expression of the transgene in this pedigree of mice provides a marker for describing early differentiation of the pulmonary epithelium; (ii) the transgene may be useful as an enhancer trap to isolate cis-acting sequences that regulate gene transcription within this lineage; (iii) the LacZ reporter expression can be used to purify specific embryonic pulmonary epithelial cell populations; and (iv) primary cultures of these embryonic populations represent a potentially useful model system for analyzing the cellular components and signaling pathways necessary to support and complete passage through the type II pneumocyte differentiation program."
