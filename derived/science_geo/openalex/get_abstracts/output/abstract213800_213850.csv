https://openalex.org/W2072089033,"Hydroxyurea, hydroxyurethane, and dihydroxyurea inhibit incorporation of thymidine into the DNA of monolayers of HeLa cells. They do not affect incorporation of uridine into RNA or of leucine into protein. In contrast, hydroxylamine inhibits cellular incorporation of all three precursors: thymidine, uridine, and leucine. Hydroxyurea does not affect thymidine kinase, thymidylate kinase, or DNA polymerase reactions, but it does inhibit incorporation of cytidylic and guanylic acids into DNA in cell-free supernatants."
https://openalex.org/W2016689569,"Carbon-14, derived from the testing of thermonuclear weapons in the atmosphere of the Northern Hemisphere during 1961-62, has been found in human tissues including the brain in amounts which reflect the atmospheric concentration of carbon-14 as of several months earlier. In collagen of cartilage, the rate of uptake of carbon-14 is much slower than in other tissues; essentially no radioactive carbon was found in the collagen of 70-year-old adults that had been exposed to the comparatively high concentrations of carbon-14 in the atmosphere during the years 1954 to 1964. Individuals from the Southern Hemisphere show little increase in the carbon-14 content of their tissues at present, and detailed tests with individuals traveling to the Northern Hemisphere from the Southern allow closer scrutiny of the tissue replacement rates."

https://openalex.org/W1997403237,"Insulin corrects the disturbances in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in rats made diabetic with alloxan. However, the concomitant administration of actinomycin D with insulin prevents the repair of enzymatic defects in the syntheses of total fatty acids by adipose tissue, of monounsaturated fatty acids by liver microsomes, and of hepatic glycogen. The hypoglycemic action of insulin in diabetes is not modified by actinomycin injections. These findings indicate that a fundamental mechanism of action of insulin is the induction of enzyme synthesis through stimulating the renewal of cellular RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2086994403,"The height of the overshoot of the action potential recorded from frog ventricles is markedly less sensitive to lowering the external sodium concentration than predicted by the sodium-hypothesis of excitation, and it is surprisingly sensitive to changes in the external calcium concentration. These observations are explained by a mechanism in which there is competition between sodium and calcium ions, in the excitable membrane, for anionic sites which control the inward current of sodium ions at the crest of the action potential."

https://openalex.org/W2078826345,"Two factors involved in the adaptation in stretch receptor cells of crayfish were separated and studied: (i) the decline of the rate of discharge during intracellular application of constant current and (ii) the decline of generator potential during sustained stretch. The change in generator potential with time was essentially identical in both rapidly and slowly adapting cells. The slowly adapting cells continued to discharge throughout the application of depolarizing currents, whereas the rapidly adapting cells stopped discharging while the current was applied. The different rates of adaptation are therefore attributable to the difference in the properties of the electrically excitable membranes rather than the properties which produce generator potentials."

https://openalex.org/W2016079044,"If an instrumental conditioning schedule is arranged so that a dog must repeatedly perform a movement in response to one stimulus in order to secure the presentation of another stimulus, which is then followed by food, a virtually total separation of motor and salivary responses is observed. The first stimulus elicits the trained movement without salivation, and the second stimulus elicits salivation without instrumental responding. These experiments show a relative independence between classical and instrumental conditioned responses and clarify the rather complex relations between the two in the usual experimental procedure."

https://openalex.org/W2086871535,The mitochondria-rich fraction of the lung tissue is the most active subcellular fraction for the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids. This observation is contrary to what has been reported for the subcellular fractions of the liver. The high rate of fatty acid synthesis observed with the mitochondria-rich fraction of the lung may be related to the morphological transformation of mitochondria.
https://openalex.org/W2082657533,"Responses of some cells in the cat cortex to moving stimulation depend on direction of motion. These cells give neither ""on"" nor ""off"" responses to uniform illumination. Response can be elicited over a wide region of the retina in either eye, and the discharge pattern does not follow the temporal variations in luminance on the retina which accompany the movement of the stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W1982356700,"Spectrally opponent cells of the macaque lateral geniculate are very sensitive to shifts from one wavelength to another, independent of the relative intensities of the different wavelengths. Shifts in opposite spectral directions from the adaptation wavelength produce opposite changes in firing rate, regardless of the particular wavelengths involved; however, any given cell is more sensitive to shifts in some spectral regions than in others."

Because of the widespread concern about possible toxic effects of fluoride when used for water fluoridation, these levels are of more than theoretical interest."

https://openalex.org/W2090392291,"If electroconvulsive shock is given immediately after a learning session, retroactive amnesia for that response occurs. Such results may be due to production of aversive responses or to interference with consolidation of the neural engram, or to both. Aversive responses or competing responses are not adequate explanations for retroactive amnesia. Consolidation theory provides the most plausible explanation. The single-shock method is an appropriate approach for studying the relationships between electroconvulsive shock and retroactive amnesia."
https://openalex.org/W2124338850,"Microvibrations were recorded from the dorsal body surface of a bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) while it swam in water and while it lay on a foam rubber mattress in an air environment. Unlike poikilothermic water-living animals which do not manifest microvibrations, this homeothermic mammal has 13-cycle per second microvibrations similar to those of man and other homeotherms. For comparative purposes, microvibrations of 11 cycles per second were recorded from the arm of a man while lying on the same mattress. The nature and origin of these microvibrations is discussed in relation to physiological tremors and shivering."

https://openalex.org/W2069305475,"THE occurrence and possible function of the neuraminic acids in mammalian tissues and fluids is a matter of great interest. Large amounts of N-acetylneuraminic acid have been demonstrated in the seminal fluid of man1,2, bull3 and boar4. Analysis of the secretions of the accessory genital organs of the boar showed that the mucin from the bulbourethral glands contained 4–4.5 per cent (fresh weight) of neuraminic acid. The concentration was less in the seminal vesicles and negligible in the other glandular secretions5. In man the average concentration of neuraminic acid was in the seminal vesicle fluids 231.9 mg/100 ml., in the prostatic secretions 60.6 mg/100 ml., and in the seminal fluid 124.2 mg/100 ml. From these data, Warren2 calculated that approximately two-thirds of the seminal fluid came from the prostate gland. It is, however, difficult to calculate the relative contribution of the various glandular systems to the ejaculate by using data obtained from extracts of autopsy material."

https://openalex.org/W2021880113,"RECENTLY, reports have appeared in the press of experiments demonstrating the existence of a dermal sensitivity to intensities and wave-lengths of visible light. Many of the experiments do not appear to have precluded thermal effects, and B. Konstantinov has suggested1 that the results may be explained by the perception of reflected infra-red radiation emitted by the hand. In the experiment recorded here these effects have been reduced, and college-age subjects have been required to discriminate between black and white."
