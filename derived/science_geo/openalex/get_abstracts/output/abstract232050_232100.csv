Whereas superoxide impairs mitochondrial function and is removed by Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase, the role and metabolism of mitochondrial H2O2 during apoptosis have remained unclear. The effects on apoptotic signaling of depletion of peroxiredoxin (Prx) III, a mitochondrion-specific H2O2-scavenging enzyme, have now been investigated by RNA interference in HeLa cells. Depletion of Prx III resulted in increased intracellular levels of H2O2 and sensitized cells to induction of apoptosis by staurosporine or TNF-α. The rates of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation were increased in Prx III-depleted cells, and these effects were reversed by ectopic expression of Prx III or mitochondrion-targeted catalase. Depletion of Prx III also exacerbated damage to mitochondrial macromolecules induced by the proapoptotic stimuli. Our results suggest that Prx III is a critical regulator of the abundance of mitochondrial H2O2, which itself promotes apoptosis in cooperation with other mediators of apoptotic signaling.

Normal cellular processes that involve oxygen result in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CHX, cycloheximide; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; DEVD-AMC, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin); DHR123, dihydrorhodamine 123; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanin iodide; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NAO, 10-N-nonyl-acridine orange; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Prx, peroxiredoxin; PTP, permeability transition pore; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CHX, cycloheximide; CM-H2DCFDA, 5-(and 6-)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; DEVD-AMC, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin); DHR123, dihydrorhodamine 123; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; JC-1, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanin iodide; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; NAO, 10-N-nonyl-acridine orange; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; Prx, peroxiredoxin; PTP, permeability transition pore; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; SOD, superoxide dismutase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase. such as superoxide (O2:, H2O2, and the hydroxyl radical (OH.). Each of these species has the potential to oxidize macromolecules and thereby to induce mutation of DNA, impairment of protein function, and lipid peroxidation. Most ROS in unstimulated mammalian cells are generated as a result of the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen toO2⋅¯ by electrons that leak from the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mainly from complexes I and III (1Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 2Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch Biochem.

Given its charged nature,O2⋅¯ does not readily cross membranes; therefore, if not destroyed, it inhibits mitochondrial function by inactivating the Fe-S centers in the electron transport chain (complexes I and III) and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (aconitase) (4Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). The burden ofO2⋅¯ production is largely countered by Mn2+-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an enzyme specifically localized in the mitochondrial matrix (5Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4797) Google Scholar). The SOD reaction only partially relieves oxidative stress in mitochondria, however, given that its product, H2O2, is itself a mild oxidant and is readily converted to the more powerful oxidant OH. via the Fenton reaction. Intracellular H2O2 is removed mostly by catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxin (Prx). GPx catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 and of various hydroperoxides with glutathione as the electron donor. There are at least four GPx isoforms in mammalian cells. GPx1 is the major isoform and is expressed in all tissues; it is localized predominantly in the cytosol, but a small proportion (∼10%) of GPx1 molecules is also present in the matrix of mitochondria (6Esworthy R.S.

Chang L. Bush K. Crapo J. Freeman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22028-22034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria apparently also must import glutathione because they also lack the enzymes required for glutathione synthesis. The newly identified Prx family of peroxidases includes at least six isoforms in mammalian cells (11Chae H. Robison K. Poole L. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Among them, Prx III is synthesized with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, as is MnSOD, and is then transferred to mitochondria, where its targeting residues are cleaved during maturation (12Chae H.Z.

On reaction with H2O2, the redox-sensitive Cys residue of each subunit of the Prx homodimer is oxidized to Cys-SOH, which then reacts with a neighboring Cys-SH of the other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide (15Seo M.S.

This disulfide is reduced specifically by thioredoxin, not by glutathione or glutaredoxin (15Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The reduced form of thioredoxin is then regenerated by thioredoxin reductase at the expense of NADPH (11Chae H. Robison K. Poole L. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Mammalian mitochondria contain thioredoxin 2 and thioredoxin reductase 2, both of which are synthesized in the cytosol with mitochondrial targeting sequences and become localized specifically in mitochondria (16Spyrou G.

Mitochondria play a central role in apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c and other proapoptotic proteins (reviewed in Refs. 18Green D.R. Reed J.C.

The release of cytochrome c into the cytosol results in the activation of caspases by triggering formation of the apoptosome (22Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial production of ROS is also thought to be associated with the activation and propagation of apoptosis (4Wallace D.C.

Indeed, generation of ROS by mitochondria appears to be an early event in apoptotic signaling initiated by TNF-α, ceramide, or glutamate (29Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R.

Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), whereas other studies suggest that ROS production occurs relatively late in cells that have already committed to die (35Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C.

Most of these various observations, however, did not make a distinction betweenO2⋅¯ and H2O2, the former of which preferentially oxidizes certain metal ions whereas the latter oxidizes cysteine and methionine residues. An important role forO2⋅¯ in apoptotic signaling was previously suggested by the observations that overexpression of MnSOD conferred increased resistance to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity, that expression of MnSOD antisense RNA increased the sensitivity of cells to TNF-α, and that induction of MnSOD expression in cells was protective under various proapoptotic conditions (37Kops G.J.

Homozygous knockout of the MnSOD gene is lethal in mice, whereas mice that lack cytosolic SOD (Cu/ZnSOD) appear normal (41Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J.

Experiments with heterozygous MnSOD knockout mice or cell lines derived from these animals have shown that the partial deficiency of MnSOD promotes cellular apoptotic events, such as cytochrome c release and the permeability transition of mitochondria, under various conditions (43Fujimura M.

Deficiency of MnSOD activity was also associated with increased damage to mitochondrial proteins such as aconitase and NADH dehydrogenase (45Van Remmen H. Williams M.D. Guo Z. Estlack L. Yang H.

UnlikeO2⋅¯, whose effects on mitochondrial function are well established, the effects of H2O2 production in mitochondria remain unclear. Given the absence of catalase from mitochondria in most cell types, GPx1 has been thought to play the major role in the protection of these organelles against oxidative damage by H2O2 (3Turrens J.F.

However, homozygous GPx1 knockout mice appear healthy and do not manifest an increased sensitivity to hyperoxia or an increased content of protein carbonyl groups or lipid peroxides (9Ho Y.-S.

Furthermore, hepatocytes isolated from these animals did not show an enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis initiated by TNF-α receptors or Fas (51Bajt M.L. Ho Y.S. Vonderfecht S.L. Jaeschke H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A protective role for GPx1 became apparent, however, when the GPx1 knockout and control mice, or cell lines derived from these animals, were subjected to extreme oxidative stress such as that associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury or treatment with paraquat or a bolus of H2O2 (48de Haan J.B.

It remains unclear whether the effect of GPx1 knockout under these conditions was attributable to the absence of the enzyme from the cytosol or from mitochondria, or from both. The specific localization of Prx III in mitochondria (12Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin.

Therefore, with the use of RNA interference (RNAi), we have now investigated the effects of depletion of endogenous Prx III on oxidative damage to mitochondrial components and on apoptotic events. Our results indicate that Prx III is much more abundant in mitochondria than is GPx1 and is a critical regulator of the mitochondrial H2O2 concentration, in contrast to the widely held view that GPx1 is the only important H2O2-metabolizing enzyme in mitochondria (3Turrens J.F.

We further demonstrate a regulatory function for Prx III during apoptosis induced by staurosporine or TNF-α. Depletion of Prx III by RNAi—A small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex targeting the 5′-AAGCCAAGUCCAGCUGCUUCC-3′ sequence in the open reading frame of human Prx III mRNA as well as siCONTROL® non-targeting siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The RNAs were introduced into HeLa cells by transfection with the use of a Nucleofector instrument (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—The DNA sequence for human GPx1 was amplified by PCR from HeLa cell cDNA and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET17b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The resulting plasmid, pET17b-GPx1, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the primers 5′-TGGCGTCCCTCTGCGGCACCACGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCGTGGTGCCGCAGAGGGACGCCA-3′ (mutated residue in bold) in order to replace selenocysteine at position 47 with cysteine. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the mutated plasmid were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth and expression of the recombinant protein was induced by incubation of the cells for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 10 vol of ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm aminoethylbenzene sulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and then disrupted by pressure. After centrifugation of the cell lysate at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was treated immediately on ice with streptomycin sulfate (final concentration, 1%) for 30 min and then centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove the precipitated nucleic acid. Human GPx1 was purified from the resulting supernatant by a series of chromatographic steps including HPLC on TSK DEAE-5PW and TSK phenyl-5PW columns (Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) as well as gel filtration on Superose-6 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Recombinant human Prx III was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (12Chae H.Z. Kim H.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1999; 45: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Induction of Apoptosis—HeLa cells were exposed for the indicated times to 200 nm staurosporine (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or to the combination of TNF-α (15 ng/ml) (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) and cycloheximide (CHX) (10 μg/ml). Subcellular Fractionation—Cytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions were prepared from HeLa cells with the use of a Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit (Calbiochem). Immunoblot Analysis—HeLa cell lysates were prepared and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (55Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi S.Y. Yu S. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25370-25376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and to cytochrome c were obtained from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA), those to β-actin were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), polyclonal antibodies to caspase-3 and to caspase-9 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), those to GPx1 were from LabFrontier (Seoul, Korea), and rabbit antiserum to Prx III, Prx I, and thioredoxin reductase 2 were described previously (12Chae H.Z.

Carbonylated proteins in the mitochondrial fraction were labeled by derivatization of the carbonyl groups with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and then detected with antibodies specific for the latter moiety (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) (56, Levine, R. L., Wehr, N., Williams, J. A., Stadtman, E. R., and Shacter, E. (2000) Methods In Molecular Biology, Vol. 99, pp. 15-24, Clifton, NJ.Google Scholar). Assay of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was assayed by incubating cell lysate (10 μg of protein) with 200 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 25 μm Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-(7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) (DEVD-AMC) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). The fluorescence generated by cleavage of the artificial substrate was measured with a CytoFluor 4000 instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Confocal Microscopy—Cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100. Endogenous Prx III was detected with specific antiserum (1:50 dilution) and Alexa-488-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Mitochondria were stained with 0.1 μm MitoTracker Red CMXRos and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml), both from Molecular Probes. Confocal fluorescence images were obtained with an LSM510 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Tornwood, NJ). Apoptotic cells were quantified as a percentage of total cells on the basis of their condensed or fragmented nuclei as revealed by the Hoechst dye; at least 300 cells from five random fields were scored for each sample. Flow Cytometry—A FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for all analyses, with a minimum of 2 × 104 cells per sample for each measurement. The excitation wavelength was 488 nm, and the observation wavelength was 530 nm for green fluorescence and 585 nm for red fluorescence. Relative change in fluorescence was analyzed with WinMDI software. For analysis of apoptosis, cells were stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) as described previously (55Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi S.Y. Yu S. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25370-25376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the percentage of hypodiploid (apoptotic) cells was determined. For evaluation of cardiolipin peroxidation, cells were labeled with 5 μm 10-N-nonylacridine orange (NAO) (Molecular Probes) for 30 min and washed twice before measurement of the fluorescence emitted by cardiolipin-bound NAO. For evaluation of changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), cells (4 × 105) were incubated with 10 μg/ml of 5,5′, 6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanin iodide (JC-1) (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C and the shifts in both red and green fluorescence emissions of JC-1 were measured. Measurement of ROS—For measurement of intracellular ROS, detached cells were loaded with 5 μm 5,6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min, washed, and then analyzed immediately by flow cytometry. Direct visualization of mitochondrial ROS generation was achieved with the use of dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) (Molecular Probes). To verify that mitochondria were indeed the site of ROS formation, we incubated cells with both 1 μm DHR123 and 1 μm MitoTracker Red for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells loaded with the fluorescent probes were imaged with an LSM510 confocal microscope fitted with an objective with a magnification of ×40 and an NA of 1.3. Excitation was performed at 458 nm for R123 and at 543 nm for Mitotracker Red. R123 fluorescence was passed through a 505/530-nm band-pass filter. Mitotracker Red fluorescence was passed through a 560-nm long-pass filter. For overlaid images, exposures were collected for equal times at the same plane of focus for both excitation wavelengths; the images were overlaid with a computer and R123 fluorescence was analyzed with MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells with the use of an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and portions (2 μg) were subjected to reverse transcription in a final volume of 20 μl also with the use of a kit (Invitrogen). The resulting first-strand cDNA was diluted and used as a template for real-time PCR analysis with an ABI 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A fluorogenic probe (5′-6-FAM-CTGTGGAGCAAACC-TAMRA-3′, where 6-FAM is 6-carboxyfluorescein and TAMRA is 6-carboxy-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine and primer pair (5′-GGTATACTACGGTCAATGCTCTGAAA-3′, 5′-ACGATGGGCATGAAACTG-3′) for human cytochrome c oxidase were designed with the use of ABI Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Reactions for each sample were performed in triplicate with equal amounts of template cDNA. The amount of cytochrome c oxidase mRNA was normalized by that of human 18 S"
https://openalex.org/W2027856136,"Cytokinins (CKs), a group of phytohormones, are adenine derivatives that carry either an isoprene-derived or an aromatic side chain at the N6 terminus. trans-Zeatin (tZ), an isoprenoid CK, is assumed to play a central physiological role because of its general occurrence and high activity in bioassays. Although hydroxylation of isopentenyladenine-type CKs is a key step of tZ biosynthesis, the catalyzing enzyme has not been characterized yet. Here we demonstrate that CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) that catalyze the biosynthesis of tZ. We identified the genes from Arabidopsis using an adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (AtIPT4)/P450 co-expression system in yeast. Co-expression of AtIPT4 and CYP735A enabled yeast to excrete tZ and the nucleosides to the culture medium. In vitro, both CYP735As preferentially utilized isopentenyladenine nucleotides rather than the nucleoside and free base forms and produced tZ nucleotides but not the cis-isomer. The expression of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 was differentially regulated in terms of organ specificity and response to CK. Root-specific induction of CYP735A2 expression by CK suggests that the trans-hydroxylation is involved in the regulation of CK metabolism and signaling in roots.

Mok D.W.S. Mok M.C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity, and Function. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 155-166Google Scholar). The major natural CKs are adenine derivatives that carry an isoprene-derived side chain at the N6 terminus, although CKs with an aromatic side chain occur in some plant species (2Strnad M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 674-688Crossref Google Scholar). Small side chain variations that exist in isoprenoid CKs include the absence or presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the prenyl side chain and the stereoisomeric position (3Mok D.W. Mok M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Common derivatives are 6-(3,3-dimethylallylamino)purine, 6-((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enylamino)purine, and 6-((Z)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enylamino)purine, whose trivial names are isopentenyladenine (iP), trans-zeatin (tZ), and cis-zeatin (cZ), respectively (see Fig. 1). The reduction of the double bond in the tZ side chain, which is catalyzed by a zeatin reductase, forms 6-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbutylamino)purine, whose trivial name is dihydrozeatin (DZ) (3Mok D.W. Mok M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Among the CK species, tZ is most commonly found in higher plants and has a high activity in bioassays (4Spiess L.D. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 583-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schmitz R.Y. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 702-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In higher plants, the first step of CK biosynthesis is catalyzed by adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (IPT), which uses dimethylallyl diphosphate as an isoprene donor to prenylate adenosine phosphate. In Arabidopsis thaliana, seven IPT genes (AtIPT1 and AtIPT3–AtIPT8) have been identified (6Takei K. Sakakibara H. Sugiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26405-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 7Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies suggest that the AtIPTs preferentially utilize ADP or ATP rather than AMP, resulting in the production of iP riboside 5′-diphosphate (iPRDP) or iP riboside 5′-triphosphate (iPRTP), respectively (7Kakimoto T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 8Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The low affinity of the AtIPTs for AMP implies that most of the natural iP riboside 5′-monophosphate (iPRMP) is formed by dephosphorylation of iPRDP and iPRTP, phosphorylation of iP riboside (iPR) by adenosine kinase, and conjugation of a phosphoribosyl moiety to iP by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (3Mok D.W. Mok M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The nucleotides are further dephosphorylated and deribosylated resulting in iPR and iP, respectively. A series of modifications of the adenine moiety of CKs occurs by reactions that are part of a purine metabolic pathway (3Mok D.W. Mok M.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Classical bioassays (4Spiess L.D. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 583-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schmitz R.Y. Skoog F. Plant Physiol. 1972; 50: 702-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and recent analyses of CK receptors in Arabidopsis (9Yamada H. Suzuki T. Terada K. Takei K. Ishikawa K. Miwa K. Yamashino T. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1017-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 10Inoue T. Higuchi M. Hashimoto Y. Seki M. Kobayashi M. Kato T. Tabata S. Shinozaki K. Kakimoto T. Nature. 2001; 409: 1060-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and maize (11Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Kojima M. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrated that free base CKs, such as tZ and iP, are physiologically active forms. Moreover, differential ligand preferences of the receptors (11Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Kojima M. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) imply that side chain variations in isoprenoid CKs are highly significant for the diversification of the hormones' biological function. Biochemical and genetic mechanisms that control side chain variation have not been characterized well yet. At present, it is assumed that tZ could be synthesized via the iPRMP-dependent and the iPRMP-independent pathways (12Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In the iPRMP-dependent pathway, tZ is formed by hydroxylation of iP-type CKs. The enzymatic activity hydroxylating the prenyl side chain was detected in a microsomal fraction of cauliflower (13Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It catalyzed the conversion of iP and iPR to tZ and tZ riboside (tZR), respectively; reactivities acting on the nucleotides were not examined (13Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to metyrapone, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450), and dependence of the activity on NADPH suggested that the reaction was catalyzed by a P450 (13Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this enzyme has not been further characterized. In the iPRMP-independent pathway, tZR 5′-phosphates are proposed to be produced directly by IPT using an unknown hydroxylated side chain precursor that may be derived from the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway (12Åstot C. Dolezal K. Nordström A. Wang Q. Kunkel T. Moritz T. Chua N.-H. Sandberg G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14778-14783Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The synthesis of tZR 5′-monophosphate (tZRMP) from AMP and 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl diphosphate (HMBDP), a likely precursor, has been demonstrated to be catalyzed by TZS, an agrobacterial IPT (14Krall L. Raschke M. Zenk M.H. Baron C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, HMBDP was identified as a metabolic intermediate of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway (15Hecht S. Eisenreich W. Adam P. Amslinger S. Kis K. Bacher A. Arigoni D. Rohdich F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14837-14842Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), which occurs in bacteria and plastids (16Rohmer M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Selective labeling experiments using 13C-labeled precursors specific for either the MEP or MVA pathway demonstrated that the isoprenoid side chain of iP and tZ predominantly originates from the MEP pathway, whereas a large fraction of the cZ side chain is derived from the MVA pathway (17Kasahara H. Takei K. Ueda N. Hishiyama S. Yamaya T. Kamiya Y. Yamaguchi S. Sakakibara H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14049-14054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the utilizing efficiency of Arabidopsis IPT was much lower for HMBDP than for dimethylallyl diphosphate in vitro (18Takei K. Dekishima Y. Eguchi T. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological significance of the iPRMP-independent pathway remains obscure to date. Although several routes might contribute to tZ production in higher plants, the physiological importance and functional differentiation of the possible pathways is unclear. As a first step toward an understanding of the trans-hydroxylation step of iP-type CKs in the iPRMP-dependent pathway, we attempted to identify CK hydroxylase genes in Arabidopsis. Here we demonstrate that CYP735A encode CK trans-hydroxylases that catalyze the biosynthesis of tZ and discuss the physiological role of the trans-hydroxylation in the regulation of CK metabolism and signaling. Construction of Plasmids—cDNA for an Arabidopsis NADPH-P450 reductase (ATR1) (19Urban P. Mignotte C. Kazmaier M. Delorme F. Pompon D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19176-19186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) was synthesized by reverse transcriptase-PCR and cloned into the NotI/SpeI site of the pESC-LEU vector (Stratagene) to yield a plasmid designated pESC-ATR1. The coding region of AtIPT4 was ligated into the ApaI/SalI site of pESC-ATR1 to yield a plasmid designated pESC-ATR1-IPT4. For preparation of the coding region of various P450s, we designed PCR primers based on predicted sequences from the Arabidopsis P450 data base (www.biobase.dk/P450/index.shtml). Each of the reverse transcriptase-PCR products was ligated into the pYES2.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to yield a series of plasmids designated pYES-P450. pYES2.1/V5-His/lacZ (Invitrogen) was used as a control plasmid (pYES-lacZ). Screening of CK Hydroxylase Genes—pESC-ATR1-IPT4 and each member of the pYES-P450 series were co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH499 (Stratagene). The yeast cells were grown in complete minimal drop-out medium (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1994: 13.1.1-13.1.7Google Scholar) without leucine and uracil (CM-Leu-Ura) and with 1% raffinose at 30 °C for 24 h. The liquid medium was changed to CM-Leu-Ura with 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 80 μg/ml 5-aminolevulinic acid, and the A600 was adjusted to 0.4 and further cultured overnight at 20 °C. After removal of cells by centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2% acetic acid. The CK content was analyzed by liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS). CK Analysis—CKs were analyzed with a LC-MS system (model 2695/ZQ2000MS; Waters) on a reverse-phase column (Symmetry C18, 5 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in 0.1% acetic acid with a linear gradient of methanol (0% for 1 min, 0–50% for 15 min, and 50–70% for 6 min). CKs were quantified in the selected ion recording mode. Monitored ions for each CK species were as follows: m/z 220 and 352 for tZR and cZ riboside, m/z 136 and 220 for tZ and cZ, m/z 222 and 354 for DZ riboside (DZR), m/z 136 and 222 for DZ, m/z 204 and 336 for iPR, m/z 136 and 204 for iP, and m/z 357 for [2H5]tZR. Other conditions for MS analysis were as described previously (8Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Preparation of Microsomal Fraction—Yeast cells harboring pESC-ATR1 and pYES-CYP735As were cultured in 500 ml of medium under inductive conditions as described above. The microsomal fraction was prepared by the method of Venkateswarlu et al. (21Venkateswarlu K. Lamb D.C. Kelly D.E. Manning N.J. Kelly S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4492-4496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), except that the buffer A did not contain reduced glutathione. After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was further washed once with the buffer A. The final preparation of microsomal pellet was resuspended in the buffer A. Protein concentration was determined with protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The P450 content was estimated by the method of Omura and Sato (22Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of iP Nucleotides—iPRMP, iPRDP, and iPRTP were synthesized enzymatically with IPTs (AtIPT1 and TZS) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and with AMP, ADP, and ATP, respectively, and purified by anion exchange chromatography using a MonoQ column as described previously (8Takei K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. J. Plant Res. 2003; 116: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). tZRMP was purchased from Apex Organics (Devon, UK). Enzyme Assay—Microsomal proteins were incubated in 40 μl of reaction mixture (100 mm sodium phosphate, 10% sucrose, iP-type CK, 3 mm NADPH, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) at 20 °C for appropriate periods; the amounts of microsomal protein and molecular species of iP-type CK are indicated in the text. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of termination buffer (50 mm CHES-NaOH, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 10.0). The mixture was treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (10 units; Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 20 μl of 20% acetic acid and 2 pmol [2H5]tZR (OlChemim, Olomouc, Czech Republic) to determine the recovery in the following steps, the mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was passed through a reverse-phase column (Oasis HLB, 10 mg/1cc; Waters) pre-equilibrated with 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml of water. The column was washed twice with 1 ml of water, and CKs were eluted with 1 ml of methanol. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and residual materials were dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid. After centrifugation, CKs in the supernatant were quantified with LC-MS. Identification of the Reaction Products as the Nucleotide Forms— Microsomal proteins (100 μg) were incubated in 200 μl of the reaction mixture with 50 μm iPRMP at 20 °C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 20% acetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was passed through an Ultrafree MC centrifugal filter (Biomax-10; Millipore). The filtrate was loaded onto an ODS column (Supersphere RP-select B, 4 mm × 250 mm; Merck) by an HPLC system (model 600/717plus/PDA996; Waters) as described previously (23Takei K. Sakakibara H. Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The fraction containing the reaction product was dried and redissolved in 0.1% acetic acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed with a LC-MS system as described above. The mass spectra were obtained by electrospray ionization scanning positive ions from m/z 120 to 500. The capillary voltage was 4 kV. Extraction of RNA—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia was grown hydroponically on MGRL culture medium (24Fujiwara T. Yokota-Hirai M. Chino M. Komeda Y. Naito S. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) for 4 weeks as described (25Takei K. Ueda N. Aoki K. Kuromori T. Hirayama T. Shinozaki K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and the rosette leaves, flowers, roots, and stems were harvested separately. The organs were soaked in water or 5 μm iP by vacuum infiltration and incubated for 1 h. For phytohormone treatment, Arabidopsis seedlings that had been grown on MGRL vertical agar plates for 12 days were sprayed with 5 μm of various hormones. After 1 h, total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). Quantitative Real Time PCR—The real time PCR was performed on an ABIPRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with a qPCR core kit for SYBR-Green I (Eurogentec) as described (25Takei K. Ueda N. Aoki K. Kuromori T. Hirayama T. Shinozaki K. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).

Isolation of Arabidopsis P450 Genes Involved in tZ Biosynthesis Using the AtIPT4/P450 Co-expression System—To identify gene(s) that catalyze tZ biosynthesis, we designed a screening method using an AtIPT4/P450 co-expression system in yeast. When AtIPT4, which catalyzes an initial step of the biosynthesis of iP nucleotides, was expressed in yeast, iP and iPR but not tZ and tZR were excreted into the culture medium (Table I, pYES-lacZ/pESC-ATR1-IPT4). Thus, AtIPT4 can synthesize iP nucleotides in yeast cells, whereas authentic yeast enzymes transform iP nucleotides into the corresponding nucleosides and free bases. However, the hydroxylation activity required for tZ production is lacking. We reasoned that if the appropriate P450 were co-expressed with AtIPT4 in yeast, tZ-type CKs could be expected to be synthesized. To construct such cell lines, we used two expression vectors, one carrying AtIPT4 and the other carrying one of a series of Arabidopsis P450s. To gain electrotransfer efficiency from NADPH to the plant P450s in yeast, an Arabidopsis NADPH-P450 reductase ATR1 was also expressed in the yeast cells in all cases (19Urban P. Mignotte C.

For further experiments, we chose genes that appeared closely related to CK metabolism, either because they encoded homologues of P450s known to catalyze the trans-hydroxylation of the terminal-methyl group in isoprenoid compounds (At2g45560, At2g45580, At2g45550, and At3g52970) (29Collu G.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), because they were regulated by CKs (At1g67110) (30Rashotte A.M. Carson S.D. To J.P. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1998-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or because they were induced in a CK-overproducing mutant (At1g13710) (31Helliwell C.A. Chin-Atkins A.N. Wilson I.W. Chapple R. Dennis E.S. Chaudhury A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2115-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Their homologues (At5g38450, At2g46960, At2g46950, At4g27710, At5g09970, At1g01190, At3g61880, and At1g74110) and some others (At1g16410, At1g16400, At3g26220, At5g36220, At4g37310, At4g00360, At2g27690, At2g23180, and At2g34500) were also chosen. We expressed these P450s in the yeast system and found that the supernatants of cultures expressing CYP735A1 (At5g38450) and CYP735A2 (At1g67110) contained tZ and tZR at similar levels as iP and iPR (Table I). Significant amounts of DZ and DZR and traces of cZ and cZ riboside were also detected in both culture media (Table I). CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 (formerly named CYP709A1 and CYP709A2, respectively) are members of the CYP735A subfamily in Arabidopsis and share 79% identity at the amino acid level. CYP735A2 was first described as a CK-inducible gene by a DNA microarray analysis (30Rashotte A.M. Carson S.D. To J.P. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1998-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In a phylogenetic tree of Arabidopsis P450 genes, the CYP709B subfamily was a sister group of the CYP735A subfamily (biobase.dk/P450/p450.shtml). It consisted of three genes, CYP709B1 (At2g46960), CYP709B2 (At2g46950), and CYP709B3 (At4g27710), which showed 35–40% identity with the CYP735As at the amino acid level. We tested the ability of the CYP709Bs to hydroxylate CKs in the yeast system, but no secretion of tZ-type CKs was detected (data not shown). CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 Utilize iP Nucleotides as Substrates—Microsomal fractions prepared from yeast co-expressing ATR1 and CYP735A1 or CYP735A2 were used to measure the enzymatic activity in vitro. When iP nucleotides were used as substrates, efficient conversion to tZ-type CKs was detected (Fig. 2A). iPRMP and iPRDP were processed more efficiently than iPRTP by both CYP735As. The conversion efficiency of iP and iPR was less than 10% of that of iPRTP (Fig. 2A). These results strongly suggest that the CYP735As function as iP nucleotide hydroxylases in vivo. Although the activity was almost abolished when NADPH was absent from the reaction mixture, the presence of NADH partially restore the activity (Table II). This suggests that the reaction was not completely dependent on NADPH-P450 reductase, and NADH could act as an electron donor probably via other reduction systems such as a NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase/cytochrome b5 system (32de Vetten N. ter Horst J. van Schaik H.P. de Boer A. Mol J. Koes R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The substantial inhibition of the reaction by metyrapone was coincided with the sensitivity to this compound of the CK hydroxylase detected in the microsomal fraction of cauliflower (13Chen C.-M. Leisner S.M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 442-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CYP735A1 was more sensitive to metyrapone than CYP735A2 (Table II).Table IIEnzymatic properties of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2ConditionsRelative activityCYP735A1aMicrosomal fractions were prepared from yeasts harboring pESC-ATR1/pYES-CYP735As.CYP735A2aMicrosomal fractions were prepared from yeasts harboring pESC-ATR1/pYES-CYP735As.ControlbActivity was measured in the reaction mixture with 10 μg of microsomal protein and 10 μm iPRMP.

Open table in a new tab In our routine method of measuring P450 activity, we dephosphorylated the primary products with phosphatase and monitored the nucleosides because of the difficulties to separate nucleotides on reverse-phase columns and the low sensitivity for nucleotides of our MS analysis. To confirm the nature of the primary product, the reaction products generated by CYP735A1 with iPRMP as a substrate were prepared on a large scale and were purified. The retention time determined by HPLC (Fig. 2B) and the spectrum obtained by LC-MS (Fig. 2C) showed that the primary product was tZRMP. We obtained a similar result with CYP735A2 (data not shown). CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 Catalyze trans-Hydroxylation in Vitro—In the culture medium of yeasts co-expressing AtIPT4/CYP735A, cZ-type and DZ-type CKs were also detected (Table I). To establish whether CYP735As catalyze the formation of cis-isomers and/or the reduction of the tZ side chain in vitro, we analyzed the reaction products by LC-MS. When iPRMP was used as substrate, both CYP735As mainly produced the trans-isomer; production of the cis-isomer occurred at a negligible level (Fig. 3, m/z 352). Although a small peak was detected at m/z 354, it was an unrelated peak because the retention time of the peak (13.3 min) did not coincide with that of the DZR standard (13.1 min; Fig. 3, m/z 354). When tZRMP was incubated with total soluble proteins prepared from the yeast transformants, production of DZR 5′-monophosphate was detected. However, this conversion was not CYP735A-dependent (data not shown). We concluded that the production of cZ and DZ-type CKs in the yeast expression system was due to endogenous enzymatic activities of the yeast cells and that CYP735As catalyze the stereo-specific formation of tZ nucleotides. Kinetic Parameters of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2—The contents of P450s in the microsomes were estimated to be 0.062 nmol/mg of microsomal protein for CYP735A1 by analysis of CO difference spectra (Fig. 4). The content of CYP735A2 could not be determined because of its low expression level in yeast (data not shown). We determined the kinetic parameters of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 for the iP nucleotides (Table III). Of all substrates tested, the Km values of CYP735A1 and CYP735A2 for iPRMP were the smallest, whereas those for iPRTP were the largest. CYP735A2 exhibited higher substrate affinities than CYP735A1 in all cases. The Km values for iP and iPR could not be determined because of the low activities with these substrates. Furthermore, comparisons of the catalytic constants (kcat) and the specificity constants (kcat/Km) of the reactions strongly suggested that CYP735As preferentially act on iPRMP and iPRDP (Table III).Table IIIKinetic para"

Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). A variety of molecules including proteins, peptides, lipids, small molecules, and even photons activate GPCRs, and in most cases, the recognition of ligands by GPCRs is specific. GPCRs are also important pharmaceutical targets, as about half of the drugs currently used are either agonists or antagonists for various GPCRs (7Chalmers D.T. Behan D.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). G2A (derived from G2 accumulation) was originally isolated as a stress-inducible GPCR that induces the cell cycle arrest at G2/M periods when serum-starved or DNA-damaged (8Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A. Fernal A.A. Le Beau M.M. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12334-12339Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). G2A is expressed in pro-B and T cells, and the expression of G2A is inducible upon activation and stress stimulation in the cells (8Weng Z. Fluckiger A.C. Nisitani S. Wahl M.I. Le L.Q. Hunter C.A.

Recently, G2A was found to be expressed in macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques (9Rikitake Y. Hirata K. Yamashita T. Iwai K. Kobayashi S. Itoh H. Ozaki M. Ejiri J. Shiomi M. Inoue N. Kawashima S.

Mice deficient in G2A developed an autoimmune syndrome similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which was explained by the hyperstimulation of G2A-null T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking (10Le L.Q.

Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) by PCR using KOD-Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and primers (sense primer, 5′-GGGGTACCCTACTGAAAAACGGTTACAATGG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GGAATTCAGCAGGACTCCTCAATCAG-3′) and designated as pCXN2.1-FLAG-G2A. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by an overhang method (as described in Molecular Cloning, 3rd Ed. (49Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar)) using KOD-Plus. The primers for mutagenesis were 5′-CTGCTTCGCCCCGTACTTCCTGGTTCTCCTCGTC-3′ for H259F and 5′-CCTCGTCGGGATCGTTTTCTACCCGGTGTTCCAGACG-3′ for H174F and their complementary oligonucleotides. Entire open reading frames (ORFs) for WT and mutant G2A were sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometry—PC12h cells (donated by the late Professor H. Hatanaka of Osaka University) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH-3T3, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, and COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with pCXN2.1-FLAG-G2A using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were cultured for 2 weeks under 1.0 mg/ml G418 (Wako). For staining, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody (M5) in PBS (–) containing 2% goat serum (PBS/goat serum) for 30 min, followed by staining with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in PBS/goat serum for 15 min. Cells highly expressing G2A were collected as a polyclonal population by cell sorting using EPICS ALTRA (Coulter Electronics Ltd.) and maintained under 0.3 mg/ml G418. EPICS XL (Coulter Electronics Ltd.) was used for flow cytometry. Reporter Gene Assay—pH-induced responses were determined by reporter gene assay (Naito et al., Japanese patent publication number JP2000-354500) with modifications. 1.5 × 105 PC12h cells were transfected with 400 ng of pCXN2.1-FLAG-G2A or an empty vector, 480 ng of zif 268-firefly luciferase-pGL2 (a kind gift from Dr. T. Naito, Japan Tobacco, Tokyo, Japan), 20 ng of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoterdriven Renilla luciferase-pRL (Promega, Madison, WI), and/or other constructs of interest using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hiden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. An expression vector for C3 exoenzyme (pEF-C3) was a kind gift from Dr. S. Narumiya (Kyoto University), and an expression vector for a dominant negative form of RhoA (pCMV5-RhoA-T19N) was from Dr. H. Ito (Nara Institute of Science and Technology). 50 ng of pEF-C3 and 100 ng of pCMV5-RhoA-T19N were used for a single transfection. We equalized the total amount of DNA for transfection (1.0 μg/1.5 × 105 cells) among samples by adding empty vectors (pCXN2.1(+), pEF-BOS, or pCMV5). Transfected cells were cultured on a collagen-coated 24-well plate for 45 h. Cells were then stimulated for 9 h with HEM-buffered DMEM, 0.1% BSA adjusted to various pH values under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. As for cell-conditioned medium, PC12h cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/well on a 24-well plate and incubated for 45 h, followed by stimulation with HEM-buffered DMEM, 0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 7.0 for 9 h. Thereafter, the supernatant was recovered, adjusted to pH 7.6 or 7.0, filtrated to remove cell debris, and used for assay. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using PICAGENE Dual Seapansy (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan) and MiniLumat LB 9506 luminometer (Berthold, Bundoora, Australia). The relative luciferase activity is represented as a firefly luciferase value/a Renilla luciferase value (30Noguchi K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25600-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopic Observation of Actin Polymerization—NIH-3T3 cells were seeded onto a poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom dish (MATSUNAMI, Tokyo, Japan) at the density of 2 × 105 cells/dish and were serum-starved for 24 h with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (Fraction V, Sigma). Cells were then stimulated for 20 min with HEM-buffered DMEM containing 0.1% BSA adjusted to pH 7.6 or 7.0 with or without LPA (18:1), PGE2, and LPC (18:1) and subsequently fixed by 3.7% formaldehyde, PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (2 units/ml, Molecular Probes, Inc.) in 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by observation using a confocal microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a ×63 objective lens (Carl Zeiss, Germany). For quantitative analysis of stress fiber formation, the percentage of cells that exhibited strong actin stress fiber was evaluated. Eight images were randomly obtained from one culture dish, and at least 150 cells were evaluated for stress fiber formation in a blinded manner. Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged G2A—NIH-3T3 cells highly expressing G2A were grown to subconfluency on a 10-cm dish, scraped off with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)), homogenized through a 25-gauge needle, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was bound with prewashed protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation to preclear the nonspecific binding protein. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with prewashed M2-agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C with rotation, followed by 3 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Thereafter, the pellet was washed twice with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate) and twice with wash buffer without NaCl. For Western blotting analyses, half of the immunoprecipitate was applied to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to ECL membranes, and FLAG-tagged G2A was detected using biotin-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (M5) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. The signal was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system. Inositol Phosphate Accumulation Assay—COS-7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well on a 12-well plate. Twenty-four h after transfection, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) if mentioned, followed by incubation for another 18–24 h. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 45 min in HEM-buffered DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and 20 mm LiCl adjusted to various pH values. Accumulated IPs were purified by ion exchange chromatography (AG 1-X8 resin, Bio-Rad), and radioactivities were measured by scintillation counting (31Fukunaga K. Ishii S. Asano K. Yokomizo T. Shiomi T. Shimizu T. Yamaguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43025-43030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's unpaired t test or ANOVA using Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 or 0.01, as indicated. pH-dependent Activation of the zif 268 Promoter through G2A—As G2A was reported to activate RhoA in a ligand-independent manner (13Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12109-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we performed a reporter gene assay using zif 268-luciferase as a reporter gene (32Hirabayashi T. Saffen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2525-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). zif 268 promoter contains four serum-responsive elements (SREs), one Sp1-binding site, and one cAMP-responsive element (CRE) and is activated through RhoA (1Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of the receptor protein on the plasma membrane of G2A-transfected PC12h cells was confirmed by flow cytometry 2 days after transfection (data not shown). pH-dependent activation of zif 268 promoter was observed in transiently G2A-expressing cells but not in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). At pH 7.6, G2A exhibited significant activity that was double the value of the mock transfectant. However, this “constitutive” activity was actually proton-dependent activation through G2A, as G2A did not show activity at pH 8.8 (Fig. 1D). Because the basal pH of the culture medium (DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum or 0.1% BSA without any buffer) under 5% CO2 is 7.6, we describe pH 7.6 as the basal pH and describe the activity of G2A at pH 7.6 as constitutive activity hereafter. Although lowering extracellular pH evoked zif promoter activation through G2A, it is possible that PC12h cells secrete under the acidic conditions some compounds or metabolites that activate G2A. Thus, we examined zif 268 promoter activation using cell-conditioned medium. Cell-conditioned medium was obtained as culture supernatant after a 9-h incubation of PC12h cells at pH 7.0 and was adjusted to pH 7.6 or 7.0 prior to assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1B, the same level of zif promoter activation through G2A was observed with the cell-conditioned medium as with the control (cell-free) medium at pH 7.0. Cell-conditioned medium adjusted to pH 7.6 did not activate the zif promoter. This result excludes the possibility that pH-dependent activation of G2A is a result of the products secreted from the cells. Because overexpression of G2A was reported to activate Rho GTPase through G13 (13Kabarowski J.H. Feramisco J.D. Le L.Q. Gu J.L. Luoh S.W. Simon M.I. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12109-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined whether this pH-dependent activation of zif 268 promoter through G2A is inhibited by coexpression of C3 exoenzyme (33Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a dominant negative form of RhoA (RhoA-T19N) (34Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). zif 268 promoter activation through G2A both at pH 7.6 and pH 7.2 was inhibited completely by C3 exoenzyme and partially (∼50%) by RhoA-T19N (Fig. 1C). This result demonstrates that the pH-dependent activation of zif 268 promoter through G2A requires activation of Rho GTPase. pH-dependent Inositol Phosphate Production in G2A-expressing Cells—G2A was reported previously to activate IP accumulation in a ligand-independent manner (35Lin P. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14379-14386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We first examined IP formation using NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing G2A (G2A-NIH-3T3). As reported previously (36de Martin R. Schmid J.A. Hofer-Warbinek R. Mutat. Res. 1999; 437: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), IP formation in G2A-NIH-3T3 cells was 5-fold higher than in mock-transfected cells at pH 7.6, and no additional IP accumulation was observed by lowering pH (data not shown). Next, we measured IP formation using COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection and found that IP accumulation in G2A-transfected cells increased in a pH-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). This pH-dependent IP accumulation was not observed in mock-transfected cells. Pretreatment of the cells with PTX partially inhibited pH-dependent IP accumulation (Fig. 2B), showing that both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G-proteins are responsible for phospholipase C activation through G2A. Antagonistic Effects of LPC on G2A Activation at Low pH— LPC and SPC were reported previously as ligands for G2A (25Kabarowski J.H. Zhu K. Le L.Q. Witte O.N. Xu Y. Science. 2001; 293: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of LPC and SPC at various pH values. At pH 7.6, 1 μm LPC (18:1, 18:0, and 16:0), SPC, and other lipid species did not enhance nor inhibit zif promoter activation through G2A (Fig. 3A). At pH 7.2, however, only LPC (18:1, 18:0, and 16:0) showed an inhibitory effect upon pH-dependent zif promoter activation through G2A (Fig. 3B), and there was no difference observed among three LPCs with different acyl moieties at the sn-1 position in their antagonistic effects. We treated the cells with various concentrations of LPC at pH 7.2 and found that LPC inhibited zif promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether LPC or SPC inhibits pH-dependent IP formation, we performed an IP accumulation assay in the presence of LPC or SPC. As observed in the zif-luciferase reporter gene assay, 1 μm LPC (18:1, 18:0, and 16:0) or SPC did not promote nor inhibit IP formation through G2A at pH 7.6 (Fig. 3D), and LPC (18:1) inhibited IP production at acidic pH in a dose-dependent manner only in G2A-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). One μm LPC (18:1) partially (∼50%) inhibited and 10 μm LPC completely inhibited IP accumulation at various pH values (Fig. 3F). In both zif-luciferase reporter gene assay and IP accumulation assay, LPC inhibited the activation of G2A at acidic pH. Thus, LPC appears to act on G2A as an antagonist rather than an agonist. Actin Stress Fiber Formation—As shown in the reporter gene assay, the G2A signaling pathway is coupled to Rho GTPase. Activation of Rho GTPase induces actin stress fiber formation in fibroblasts (37Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 38Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We therefore observed the rearrangement of fibrous actin in NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing G2A using a confocal microscope. These cells were collected as a polyclonal population by cell sorting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proper expression of G2A on the plasma membrane was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blotting (Fig. 4, A and B). At pH 7.6, G2A-NIH-3T3 cells exhibited prominent actin stress fiber formation (Fig. 4C, top) that resembles the effect of LPA (Fig. 4C, bottom), and no significant additional rearrangement was detected at lower pH (Fig. 4C, middle). This shows that the constitutive activity of G2A at pH 7.6 is sufficient and saturable to cause stress fiber formation. Next, we determined whether LPC (18:1) inhibits the actin polymerization in G2A-NIH-3T3 cells. The stress fibers observed in G2A-NIH-3T3 cells were degraded partially by 1 μm LPC and completely degraded by 10 μm LPC (Fig. 4C). To rule out the possibility that any intrinsically expressed receptor for LPC on NIH-3T3 cells inhibits actin polymerization independently of G2A, we examined LPA (18:1)-induced actin stress fiber formation in mock transfectant in the presence of LPC at pH 7.6 (Fig. 4C). In mock-transfected NIH-3T3 cells, LPA-induced actin rearrangement was not inhibited by 1 or 10 μm LPC (18:1), suggesting that LPC alone could not inhibit actin rearrangement in NIH-3T3 cells. Surprisingly, LPA-induced actin polymerization in G2A-NIH-3T3 cells was inhibited partially by 1 μm LPC and almost completely inhibited by 10 μm LPC (18:1). For quantitative analysis of stress fiber formation, the percentage of cells that exhibited strong actin stress fiber formation was evaluated (Fig. 4D). In mock-transfected cells, stress fiber formation was enhanced by LPC. This might be because of intrinsically expressed LPC receptors (yet unidentified) that transmit positive signals to cause actin bundling. We observed a significant increase in stress fiber-positive cells in G2A-NIH-3T3 cells at pH 7.6. This was not enhanced by lowering the extracellular pH to 7.2. Ten μm LPC inhibited G2A-dependent actin polymerization both at pH 7.6 and 7.2. We further investigated inhibitory effects of LPC (18:1) on the stress fiber formation caused by other ligands. We used LPA (4Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 321-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), PGE2 (39Hasegawa H. Negishi M. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Biochem.

Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of asparagine residue 803 in HIF-1α C-TAD by factor inhibiting HIF-1/asparaginyl hydroxylase inhibits the binding of CBP/p300 to HIF-1α and thereby causes suppression of HIF-1α-dependent transcription (18Hewitson K.S.

The unique inhibitory domain (ID) of HIF-1α, located between the N-TAD and the C-TAD, is reported to inhibit the transcriptional activities of both TADs, although the detailed mechanism of action of the ID is not clearly understood (22Jiang B.-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar).In this study, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel proteins that interact with the ID of HIF-1α and might affect HIF-1α transcriptional activity. We identified the HIF-1α-interacting clone histone deacetylase (HDAC) 7, which is a transcriptional repressor belonging to the mammalian class II HDAC family. Class II HDAC family members include HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10. HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 share a high degree of homology with one another, whereas HDAC6, HDAC9, and HDAC10 share only the conserved HDAC domain (23Kao H.-Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar, 24de Ruijter A.J.M. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. Biochem.

HDAC7 plays a role in repression of gene transcription by associating with HDAC3 in vivo via recruitment of co-repressors N-CoR and SMRT in the nucleus. HDAC7, like other HDAC family members HDAC4 and HDAC5, requires HDAC3 for enzymatic activity (25Fischle W. Dequiedt F. Fillion M. Hendzel M.J. Voelter W. Verdin E. J. Biol.

HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 contain a high homologous conserved domain (HDAC domain) containing catalytic domain in the C-terminal region. The N-terminal region and the C-terminal tail of HDAC7 are less homologous to the corresponding regions of HDAC4 and HDAC5. HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 also contain N-terminal nuclear localization signal sequences and C-terminal signal-responsive nuclear export sequences (29Bertos A.R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 30McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.-L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 are known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a process regulated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (31Kao H.-Y. Verdel A. Tsai C.-C. Simon C. Juguilon H. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47496-47507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that HDAC7 forms a complex with HIF-1α and p300 in the nucleus under hypoxic conditions, resulting in increased levels of HIF-1α target genes (VEGF and Glut-1). Conversely, HDAC4 and HDAC5 did not bind HIF-1α. Moreover, HDAC7 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus under hypoxic conditions. We therefore propose a novel role for HDAC7 in regulating the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmids and Clones—The N-terminal Myc-, HA-, and FLAG-tagged pcDNA3.1(+) vectors (Invitrogen) were from Dr. Toshiaki Suzuki, and human HIF-2α and rat HIF-3α full-length cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Kietzman. Human HIF-1α cDNA was purchased from Novus Biologicals. The full-length HDAC4 and HDAC5 cDNAs were cloned from a human brain library (Takara) and mouse heart, respectively. All mutants were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, carried out by mismatch amplification using two sequential PCRs (33Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Indirect Mutagenesis. IRL Press, New York1991: 217-246Google Scholar) by the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). All constructs were sequenced to confirm no undesired mutations. pEFHAp300 was provided from Dr. T. Fujita (34Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Assays (ONPG Assay)—Yeast two-hybrid screenings were carried out using MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech), and all methods were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. For the bait construct, the cDNA encoding the inhibitory domain of human HIF-1α (HIF-1α-ID) comprising amino acid (aa) residues 601-785 was subcloned into pGBKT7, a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) vector (pGBKT7-HIF-1α-ID). The yeast host strain, AH109 (MATa strain), was transformed with pGBKT7-HIF-1α-ID to confirm that pGBKT7-HIF-1α-ID did not autonomously activate reporter genes. Briefly, the bait strain was mated with MATCHMAKER Pretransformed library (human brain) (Clontech). A total of 1.2 × 106 library clones were screened. Positive clones were selected by two steps, complementation by auxotrophy (growth on media lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine and supplemented with 2.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and β-galactosidase filter assays.cDNA fragments of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α were amplified by PCR, subcloned into pGBKT7, and transformed into strain AH109. Amplified by PCR, cDNA fragments of HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 were subcloned into pGADT7, a GAL4 activation domain (AD) vector and transformed into strain Y187 (MATα strain). After mating of these transformed strains, protein-protein interaction was quantified by β-galactosidase activities using ONPG as a substrate.Cloning of Full-length HDAC7 cDNA—A full-length cDNA of HDAC7 was cloned using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system, version 2 (Invitrogen) and Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). 5′-CCTTTCGGAGCAGTGGATTC-3′ primer was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis from human brain poly(A)+ RNA (Clontech). The amplified cDNA fragments were subcloned into Myc- and HA-tagged pcDNA3.1(+) as described above.Yeast Three-hybrid Assay—Yeast three-hybrid assays were performed using pGADT7 and the pBridge vector (Clontech). In this assay, the effects of a third protein on specific protein-protein interactions can be measured. The pBridge vector allows constitutive expression of a cloned protein (DBD fusion protein) through the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. In addition, a third protein is conditionally expressed from the MET25 promoter in pBridge in response to changes in methionine concentrations in the media. In the presence of 1 mm methionine, protein expression is repressed, and in the absence of methionine, the protein is expressed. cDNAs of HIF-1α comprising amino acids 601-826 and 735-785 were subcloned into pGADT7, and the resulting vector constructs were transformed into strain Y187. The cDNAs of HDAC7 (aa 669-952) and the N-terminal domain of p300 (aa 1-437) or CBP (aa 1-452) were subcloned into the two multiple cloning sites in the pBridge vector and transformed into Y187. After mating of these colonies, the diploid yeast were grown on media with or without methionine. The effects of the third protein (HDAC7, p300, or CBP) on the protein-protein interaction between HIF-1α and HDAC7 or p300 or CBP were measured by β-galactosidase filter assay.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 10 μg plasmid DNA/well (6-well tissue culture dishes) or the Ca/phosphate method with 2 μg plasmid/18-mm micro-cover glass (Matsunami).Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared using a Nuclear Extraction Kit (Active Motif). Protein was boiled at 95 °C in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer, followed by exposure to primary antibodies for 1 h. Anti-HIF-1α antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Myc antibody and anti-HA antibody were purified from 9E10 and 12CA5 hybridomas, respectively (MBL). Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2-FLAG) and polyclonal anti-p300 antibody were from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) and washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween. West-Dura (Pierce) was used to detect chemiluminescence.Immunofluorescence Staining—HEK293 cells were plated on 18-mm micro-cover glasses (Matsunami) and transfected with 2 μg of the appropriate plasmid using the Ca/phosphate method. After 5 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at normal or hypoxic (2% O2) oxygen concentrations for 12 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. For immunostaining, fixed cells were incubated with antibodies for 1 h, washed, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed and mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium for fluorescence with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were visualized with an Olympus 1x70 inverted system microscope equipped with charge-coupled device. The resulting images were stored using Metamorph computer software.Immunoprecipitation—After 24 h of transfection, HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed. Anti-Myc-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h. After washing with the lysis buffer five times, SDS sample buffer was added and boiled for Western blot analysis.Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HEK293 cells (plated on 6-well dishes) using Isogen (Nippon Gene). First-strand DNA was synthesized by SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by TaqMan PCR using 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). A standard curve for serial dilutions of 18S rRNA was generated. The relative standard curve method (Applied Biosystems) was used to calculate the amounts of VEGF and Glut-1 RNA.RESULTSHIF-1α Associates with HDAC7 in Yeast—HIF-1α has been shown to interact with several proteins such as CBP/p300 and factor inhibiting HIF/asparaginyl hydroxylase. Regulation of HIF-1α transcriptional activity, however, is not well understood. To clarify the transcriptional activation mechanisms of HIF-1α, we set out to identify proteins that interact with HIF-1α using the yeast two-hybrid system. Because both the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD) and C-terminal transactivation domain (C-TAD) of HIF-1α showed high background in yeast two-hybrid screenings, we used the ID (aa 601-785) located between the N-TAD and C-TAD as bait. 1.2 × 106 clones from a human brain library were screened. Two of 13 β-galactosidase-positive clones contained the same ∼1.8-kb fragment encoding the C-terminal domain of HDAC7 (aa 669-952), a member of the class II family of mammalian HDACs. The cloned HDAC7 contained the C-terminal conserved domain (HDAC domain), the catalytic domain, and the C-terminal unique tail.We further characterized the interaction between HDAC7 and HIF-1α to map the essential binding domains of HDAC7 and HIF-1α. Fig. 1A shows the relative strength of the interactions of the proteins in yeast determined by a quantitative β-galactosidase assay using ONPG. Full-length HIF-1α and constructs containing amino acids 401-600, 601-826, 601-785, 681-826, 735-826, 735-785, and 786-826 of HIF-1α retained β-galactosidase activities. Constructs with amino acids 1-481, 601-734, and 601-680 had no activity. Amino acids 401-600 and 786-826 of HIF-1α (the N-TAD and the C-TAD) alone showed relatively strong β-galactosidase activity without the presence of AD-HDAC7. These activities were due to the autonomous β-galactosidase activity as reported in the manufacturer's protocol. From this assay, the region containing amino acids 735-785 (within the ID of HIF-1α) seemed to be the minimum region required for binding to HDAC7.To determine the region within HDAC7 essential for binding to HIF-1α, we constructed vectors containing the AD fused to HDAC7 fragments and introduced them into yeast along with a vector expressing the DBD fused to a fragment of HIF-1α (aa 735-785). Fig. 1B shows that the C-terminal fragment of HDAC7 (aa 669-952), which contains the catalytic domain, C-terminal conserved domain (HDAC domain), and C-terminal tail, bound to HIF-1α. Constructs containing other C-terminal fragments of HDAC7 (Fig. 1B) or the N-terminal fragment of HDAC7 (data not shown) showed no β-galactosidase activity. These data demonstrate that HIF-1α binds to HDAC7 in yeast and suggest that the minimum contact sites included amino acids 735-785 of HIF-1α and amino acids 669-952 of HDAC7.HIF-1α and HDAC7 belong to their respective families, the HIF-α family and the class II HDAC family. To identify whether other members of each family also associated in yeast, we performed the ONPG assay using DBD fusions with the C-terminal domains of HIF-2α (aa 571-870 or 571-828) and HIF-3α (aa 506-662 or 506-635). Because other class II HDAC family members (HDAC4 and HDAC5) were structurally similar to HDAC7, we also constructed AD fusions with the C-terminal domains of HDAC4 (aa 802-1084) and HDAC5 (aa 823-1113), corresponding to the HIF-1α-binding domain of HDAC7 (aa 669-952).As shown in Fig. 1C, HIF-1α had strong β-galactosidase activity, whereas HIF-2α and HIF-3α did not show any activity. Moreover, HDAC4 and HDAC7 retained β-galactosidase activities, although, quantitatively, the level for HDAC4 was approximately one-fourth weaker than that of HDAC7. HDAC5 did not have any β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that, in yeast, HIF-1α specifically binds HDAC4 and HDAC7. HIF-1α also appears to show stronger binding to HDAC7 when compared with HDAC4.HIF-1α and HDAC7 Co-localize to the Nucleus—To examine the subcellular localization of HDAC7, HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HDAC7 and visualized by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 2, HDAC7 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm under normal oxygen concentrations; expression of HDAC7 was observed in the cytoplasm of 65.5 ± 0.67% of the transfected cells. Other class II HDAC family members, HDAC4 and HDAC5, were also visualized, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. HDAC4 was localized to the cytoplasm, whereas HDAC5 was localized to the nucleus. HDAC7 changed expression pattern from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when transfected cells were incubated under hypoxic conditions (2% O2, 12 h); 94.4 ± 0.37% of the cells expressed HDAC7 in the nucleus. On the other hand, localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 was not altered by hypoxic treatment. During hypoxia, HIF-1α was expressed solely in the nucleus, suggesting that HDAC7 and HIF-1α co-localize to the nucleus. Similar changes in HDAC7 localization induced by hypoxia were observed in HeLa cells (data not shown).Fig. 2Interaction of HIF-1α and class II HDACs in HEK293 cells. Subcellular localization of HIF-1α and class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7) under normoxic conditions (Norm. or Normoxia) and hypoxic conditions (Hypo. or Hypoxia). HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged full-length HIF-1α, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 and incubated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h). Immunofluorescence staining was performed to visualize each protein as described under “Materials and Methods” (top panels). 200 transfected cells were scored by four independent experiments. Histograms in the bottom panels show the percentage of cells containing HA-tagged proteins in the cytoplasm (C) and nucleus (N). None of the cells expressed the protein in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the interaction between HIF-1α and HDAC7 in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted. Cells were co-transfected with Myc-HIF-1α and HA-HDACs (Fig. 3A) or Myc-HDAC7 and HA-HIF-α family members (Fig. 3B). Cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies conjugated to Sepharose. Co-immunoprecipitated HDACs or HIF-α family members were detected by anti-HA antibody. In support of our results in yeast, only HDAC7 was co-precipitated by HIF-1α, and HIF-1α was co-precipitated by HDAC7 under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These results indicated specific interaction between HIF-1α and HDAC7 because other HIF-α family members and class II HDACs did not interact with each other.Fig. 3Co-immunoprecipitation of class II HDACs (HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7) and HIF-1α A, HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged full-length HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 (HA-HDAC4, HA-HDAC5, and HA-HDAC7) and Myc-tagged full-length HIF-1α (Myc-HIF-1α). Cells were incubated under normal and hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 4 h). Cells were lysed, and Myc-HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated with Myc-Sepharose. Co-immunoprecipitated HA-HDAC4, HA-HDAC5, and HA-HDAC7 were analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibody. Top panel, co-immunoprecipitated (WB) HA-tagged full-length HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7.

Each vector encoding HA-tagged full-length HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α (HA-HIF-1α, HA-HIF-2α, and HA-HIF-3α) was transiently co-transfected with the vector encoding the Myc-tagged full-length HDAC7 (Myc-HDAC7) in HEK293 cells. Cells were treated as described above. Top panel, co-immunoprecipitated (WB) HA-tagged full-length HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α.

To determine whether the signal sequence of each protein was important for localization to the nucleus, we constructed nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS) deletion mutants of HIF-1α and HDAC7 (Myc-HIF-1α-ΔNLS and HA-HDAC7-ΔNLS). The wild-type or each mutant construct was transfected into HEK293 cells and incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The transfected cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, overexpressed Myc-HIF-1α-ΔNLS and HAHDAC7-ΔNLS localized to the cytoplasm in cells incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, whereas wild-type Myc-HIF-1α (Myc-HIF-1α-WT) and HA-HDAC7 (HA-HDAC7-WT) localized to the nucleus under hypoxic conditions. We conducted co-transfection experiments using different combinations of the full-length and ΔNLS mutant expression vectors under hypoxic conditions.

We show that affinity-tagged RLI1 co-purifies with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF5, and eIF2, but not with other translation initiation factors or with translation elongation or termination factors. RLI1 is associated with 40 S ribosomal subunits in vivo, but it can interact with eIF3 and -5 independently of ribosomes. Depletion of RLI1 in vivo leads to cessation of growth, a lower polysome content, and decreased average polysome size. There was also a marked reduction in 40 S-bound eIF2 and eIF1, consistent with an important role for RLI1 in assembly of 43 S preinitiation complexes in vivo. Mutations of conserved residues in RLI1 expected to function in ATP hydrolysis were lethal. A mutation in the second ATP-binding cassette domain of RLI1 had a dominant negative phenotype, decreasing the rate of translation initiation in vivo, and the mutant protein inhibited translation of a luciferase mRNA reporter in wild-type cell extracts. These findings are consistent with a direct role for the ATP-binding cassettes of RLI1 in translation initiation. RLI1-depleted cells exhibit a deficit in free 60 S ribosomal subunits, and RLI1-green fluorescent protein was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of living cells. Thus, RLI1 may have dual functions in translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis.

The ABCs of Translation InitiationJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 40PreviewIn eukaryotes, mRNA translation initiation is a multistep process that is mediated by several initiation factors (eIFs). In yeast, even before the ribosome is involved, factors eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, and eIF5 can form a multifactor complex with GTP and methionyl-tRNA. This multifactor complex recruits the 40 S ribosomal subunit, forming the 43 S preinitiation complex, which eventually binds to mRNA and the 60 S ribosomal subunit to start translation.

Borges-Walmsley M.I. Walmsley A.R. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 21-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Typically, they contain two ABCs and a transmembrane domain. The ABC contains a nucleotide binding domain with Walker A and B motifs and an α-helical domain bearing the “LSGGQ” signature motif that, along with several other conserved features, distinguishes ABC proteins from other ATPases. ABCs bind ATP as a dimer, with the LSGGQ motif of one cassette capping the ATP molecule bound to the Walker motifs of the second cassette in the dimer. This produces an “ATP sandwich” with two ATP molecules bound to two hybrid active sites formed by the dimerized cassettes. ATP hydrolysis destabilizes the dimer, and it was proposed that a cycle of dimerization driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis can perform mechanical work. For ABC transporters, this would entail opening and closing a solute channel in the membrane through conformational changes in the transmembrane domains (2Davidson A.L. J.

The yeast proteins GCN20 and YEF3 are soluble ABC proteins whose functions are connected with the binding of tRNAs to ribosomes. YEF3 (eEF3) is an essential translation elongation factor that stimulates release of deacylated tRNA from the ribosomal E-site concurrent with the recruitment of aminoacylated tRNA to the ribosomal A-site (7Triana-Alonso F.J. Chakraburtty K. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20473-20478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GCN20 is a positive regulator of GCN2, a protein kinase that regulates protein synthesis initiation in amino acid starved cells by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). GCN20 resides in a complex with GCN1, a protein that interacts with both GCN2 and ribosomes, and this complex is believed to mediate the activation of GCN2 kinase function by uncharged tRNAs bound to the ribosomal A-site. The N-terminal domain of GCN20 promotes the regulatory function of GCN1 and the ABC domains in GCN20 seem to modulate ribosome association of the GCN1-GCN20 complex (8Marton M.J. Crouch D.

Yeast encodes three additional ABC proteins closely related to GCN20 and YEF3, known as NEW1, YER036C, and YNL014W, and a more distantly related nontransporter ABC protein called RLI1 (11Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). RLI1 is an essential protein (12Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B.

These findings raised the possibility that RLI1 functions in the initiation of protein synthesis. The process of translation initiation in eukaryotes is stimulated by an array of soluble initiation factors (eIFs), beginning with the recruitment of initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2 and GTP to the 40 S subunit to form the 43 S preinitiation complex. This reaction is stimulated in vitro by eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3 (14Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 15Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun Jr., S.Z. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L.

The eIF3 complex in yeast consists of five essential subunits (eIF3a/TIF32, eIF3b/PRT1, eIF3c/NIP1, eIF3i/TIF34, and eIF3g/TIF35) and one nonstoichiometric component, eIF3j/HCR1. The recruitment of mRNA to the 43 S complex is stimulated by the m7G cap-binding complex eIF4F and poly(A)-binding protein, to produce the 48 S complex. This assembly scans the mRNA, and the recognition of an AUG start codon triggers GTP hydrolysis by the TC, dependent on eIF5. In the last step of the pathway, the 60 S subunit joins with the 40 S complex in a reaction stimulated by eIF5B, and translation elongation then begins (14Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar, 17Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). In yeast, the TC is associated with eIF3, eIF5, and eIF1 in a multifactor complex (MFC) that can exist free of 40 S ribosomes (18Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the MFC, the β-subunit of eIF2 associates indirectly with eIF3c/NIP1 in a manner bridged by eIF5, and eIF2β also binds directly to the C-terminal domain of eIF3a/TIF32 (18Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valásek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G.

A mutation in eIF5 (tif-7A) that disrupts the indirect contact between eIF2 and eIF3, and the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of eIF3a/TIF32 (TIF32-Δ6), which lacks the binding domain for eIF2β, confer growth defects that are partially suppressed by overexpressing the TC. When combined in the same strain, these mutations produce an additive defect in translation initiation (20Valásek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G.

Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1166-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These findings plus the fact that tif5-7A impairs Met-tRNAiMet binding to 40 S subunits in vitro (18Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) led us to propose that the two independent contacts between eIF2 and eIF3 in the MFC have additive stimulatory effects on recruitment of these factors to the 40 S ribosome to form the 43 S complex. The co-purification of TAP-tagged RLI1 with eIF3a/TIF32 and eIF5 raised the possibility that RLI1 is an additional component of the MFC with a role in translation initiation. We show here that RLI1 is specifically associated with MFC components and 40 S ribosomes and that it promotes the assembly or stability of 43 S preinitiation complexes in vivo. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmids employed in this study are listed in Table I. Plasmid pDH177 was constructed as follows. The RLI1 gene, including 662 bp upstream of the ATG and 400 bp downstream of the stop codon, was amplified by PCR using the two primers 5′-CCA GAT AAA TGC TTC CAA GAA CCT TTA and 5′-AAC TGC AGT GCA GCA AAT GCT TAT CAT GAC GA and total genomic DNA from yeast strain BY4741 as template. The PCR product was cut with SpeI and PstI, and the resulting fragment was inserted between the SpeI and PstI sites of plasmid YCplac33. The DNA sequence of the entire ORF was verified, and it was shown that this plasmid complements an rli1Δ mutant.Table IPlasmids used in this studyasc, single copy; lc, low copy; hc, high copy.PlasmidDescriptionReference/SourcepRS315lc LEU2Ref. 48Sikorski R.S.

First, a SalI site was introduced immediately upstream of the RLI1 stop codon by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL kit from Stratagene (catalog no. 200516) to create a transition plasmid, pDH177-SalI. Second, we generated a 0.43-kb SalI-PstI fragment, comprising the SalI site, FLAG coding sequence, stop codon, and sequences downstream of RLI1 extending to the naturally occurring PstI site, by PCR using the two primers 5′-GCG TCG ACT ACA AGG ACG ACG ATG ACA AAA TTT AAG CAT CTT GGG ATT CGG AGA AC and 5′-AAC TGC AGT GCA GCA AAT GCT TAT CAT GAC GA and plasmid pDH177 as template. This 0.43-kb fragment was cloned into pBLUESCRIPT between the SalI and PstI sites to generate another transition plasmid, pBS0.43kb. The DNA sequence of the entire 0.43-kb fragment was verified. Third, the 0.43-kb SalI-PstI fragment in pDH177-SalI was replaced by the 0.43-kb fragment from pBS0.43kb. It was shown that the final plasmid, pDH178, can complement an rli1Δ mutant and direct the production of FLAG-tagged RLI1 of the predicted molecular weight in yeast as judged by Western analysis of whole cell extracts (WCEs) using antibodies against the FLAG epitope. The plasmids pDH181 and pDH183 were constructed in two steps. First, the DNA fragment of the entire RLI1 ORF, except for the start codon, plus 0.4 kb downstream of the stop codon, was PCR-amplified using the primers 5′-GCG TCG ACG CGT AGT GAT AAA AAC AGT CGT ATC GCT A and 5′-AAC TGC AGC AAA TGC TTA TCA TGA CGA, introducing SalI and MluI sites at the 5′-end and a PstI site at the 3′-end of the fragment. Total genomic DNA from yeast strain BY4741 was used as the template. The PCR fragment was cut with SalI and PstI and inserted between the SalI and PstI sites of pBLUESCRIPT, resulting in the transition plasmid pBS-RLI1. The DNA sequence of the entire fragment in pBS-RLI1 was verified. Second, the MluI-PstI fragment was removed from pBS-RLI1 to replace the MluI-PstI fragment in the plasmids pYER-M and pYER-R, respectively, resulting in pDH181 and pDH183. (Plasmids pYER-M and pYER-R will be described separately.) Plasmid pDH184 was derived from pDH183 by site-directed mutagenesis via PCR using the two mutagenic primers 5′-GAA AAG TTA TCT GAT GAT GAA CTG CAA AGA TTT GCC and 5′-GGC AAA TCT TTG CAG TTC ATC ATC AGA TAA CTT TTC and plasmid pDH183 as the template. The plasmid pDH185 was constructed in the same way but using the two primers 5′-GTC CAA CAT TTG TCT GAT GAT GAA TTA CAA AGA GTC GCC and 5′-GGC GAC TCT TTG TAA TTC ATC ATC AGA CAA ATG TTG GAC. The DNA sequence of the entire ORF was determined to verify the presence of the intended point mutations. Plasmid pDH98 was constructed using the primers 5′-CCA GAT AAA TGC TTC CAA GAA and 5′GAA GTG GCG CGA ATT CAC TAG TG to PCR-amplify a fragment from total genomic DNA of yeast strain YDH353. The resulting fragment was cut with SpeI and inserted into the SpeI site of plasmid pRS315, resulting in pDH98. The DNA sequence of the entire RLI1 ORF and the presence of the coding sequences for the myc5 tag at the 3′-end of the ORF were both verified. It was shown that this plasmid can complement an rli1Δ mutant. To introduce the E493Q mutation into pDH98, plasmid pDH202 was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as described above, using plasmid pDH98 as the template and the mutagenic primers 5′-GAC ATA TAC TTG ATT GAT CAG CCA TCT GCC TAC TTA G and 5′-CTA AGT AGG CAG ATG GCT GAT CAA TCA AGT ATA TGT C. The DNA sequence of the entire RLI1 ORF and the presence of the mutation were both verified. Plasmid pDH201 was constructed using the primers 5′-C GAG CTC ATG AGT GAT AAA AAC AGT CGT ATC and 5′-AAC TGC AGC AAA TGC TTA TCA TGA CGA and plasmid pDH178 as the template. The PCR fragment was digested with SacI and PstI and inserted between the SacI and PstI sites in pEMBLyex4. The DNA sequence of the entire RLI1 ORF and the presence of the coding sequences for the FLAG tag at the 3′-end of the ORF were both verified. To construct pDH203, the 1.2-kb BglII-BamHI fragment in pDH201 was removed and replaced by the corresponding BglII-BamHI fragment containing the E493Q mutation from pDH202. Yeast Strain Constructions—The yeast strains employed in this study are listed in Table II. To construct YDH312, the coding sequences for GFP were appended to the 3′-end of the chromosomal NEW1 allele immediately upstream of the stop codon by one-step homologous recombination (23Longtine M.S.

The presence of RLI11-myc13 in YDH353 was verified by Western analysis using monoclonal antibodies against c-myc epitope. Growth of this strain on YPD medium was indistinguishable from that of BY4741. To produce YDH363, pDH177 was introduced into the RLI1/rli1Δ diploid strain 24026, purchased from Research Genetics. The Ura+ transformants were sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis. An ascospore clone deleted for chromosomal RLI1 but carrying plasmid pDH177 was identified. To generate YDH364, plasmid pDH178 was introduced into YDH369, and a Leu+ Ura+ transformant was grown in SC-Ura to eliminate plasmid pDH181. Strains YDH367 and YDH368 were produced by transforming YDH363 with pDH183 or YCplac111, respectively. To produce YDH369, pDH181 was introduced into YDH363, and the transformants were selected on SCGal-Leu-Ura. A Ura+ Leu+ transformant was replica-printed on SCGal medium containing 5′-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) to evict pDH177. A similar procedure was used to generate YDH371 by introducing pDH183 into YDH363 and then evicting pDH177. Strains YDH373 and YDH374 were produced by transforming YDH363 with pDH184 or pDH185, respectively. To construct YDH391, the coding sequences for GFP were appended to the 3′-end of the chromosomal RLI11 allele immediately upstream of the stop codon by one-step homologous recombination, as described above for YDH312.

The presence of RLI1-GFP was verified by Western analysis using antibodies against GFP. Growth of this strain on YPD medium was indistinguishable from that of BY4741. To produce YDH422, YDH425, and YDH426, pDH98 was introduced into YDH363, and pDH177 was evicted by replica-plating on 5-FOA medium to generate strain YDH381. Plasmids pDH201, p1079, and pDH203 were then introduced into YDH381 to produce strains YDH422, YDH425, and YDH426, respectively.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetic screen for levamisole resistance has identified 12 genes, three of which (unc-38, unc-29, and lev-1) encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. Here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of another levamisole-resistant gene, unc-63, encoding a nAChR alpha subunit with a predicted amino acid sequence most similar to that of UNC-38. Like UNC-38 and UNC-29, UNC-63 is expressed in body wall muscles. In addition, UNC-63 is expressed in vulval muscles and neurons. We also show that LEV-1 is expressed in body wall muscle, thus overlapping the cellular localization of UNC-63, UNC-38, and UNC-29 and suggesting possible association in vivo. This is supported by electrophysiological studies on body wall muscle, which demonstrate that a levamisole-sensitive nAChR present at the C. elegans neuromuscular junction requires both UNC-63 and LEV-1 subunits. Thus, at least four subunits, two alpha types (UNC-38 and UNC-63) and two non-alpha types (UNC-29 and LEV-1), can contribute to levamisole-sensitive muscle nAChRs in nematodes."

To investigate the E2 specificity of Mdm2 we carried out an in vitro screen using a panel of ubiquitin E2s. Of the E2s tested only UbcH5A, -B, and -C and E2-25K support Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. The same E2s also support Mdm2 auto-ubiquitination. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of UbcH5B/C causes accumulation of Mdm2 and p53 in unstressed cells. We show that suppression of UbcH5B/C inhibits p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Despite up-regulating the level of nuclear p53, UbcH5B/C knockdown does not on its own result in an increase in p53 transcriptional activity or sensitize p53 to activation by the therapeutic drugs doxorubicin and actinomycin D. We provide evidence that Mdm2 is responsible, at least in part, for repression of the transcriptional activity of the accumulated p53. In MCF7 cells levels of UbcH5B/C are reduced by doxorubicin and actinomycin D. This observation and the sensitivity of p53 expression to levels of UbcH5B/C raise the possibility that E2 regulation could be involved in signaling pathways that control the stability of p53. Our data indicate that UbcH5B/C are physiological E2s for Mdm2, which make a significant contribution to the maintenance of low levels of p53 and Mdm2 in unstressed cells and that inhibition of p53 ubiquitination and degradation by targeting UbcH5B/C is not sufficient to up-regulate p53 transcriptional activity. p53 levels are regulated by ubiquitination and 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation. p53 is a substrate for the E3 ligase Mdm2, however, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) involved in p53 ubiquitination in intact cells have not been defined previously.

In normal unstressed cells the levels and activity of the p53 tumor suppressor are kept low. p53 is stabilized, and its transcriptional activity is up-regulated following diverse stresses, including ionizing and UV radiation, genotoxic drugs, and the inappropriate activation of oncogenes. This regulates the expression of multiple target genes and leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, thus preventing damaged cells from proliferating (1Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 2Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Most tumor cells have escaped this p53 surveillance. p53 is frequently inactivated by mutation. However, there are also many tumors expressing wild-type p53, which is inactivated by other mechanisms, including overexpression of Mdm2 and loss of p14ARF. Activation of the endogenous p53 pathway is an attractive approach to treatment of tumors expressing wild-type p53 (3Lain S. Lane D. Eur. J. Cancer. 2003; 39: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4Woods Y.L. Lane D.P. Hematol. J. 2003; 4: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which the activity of p53 is regulated are thus the focus of much interest. The maintenance of low levels of p53 in cells involves its ubiquitination and consequent targeting for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (5Yang Y. Li C.C. Weissman A.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitination is involved in many key processes, there is also considerable general interest in components of the ubiquitination pathway as therapeutic targets for treatment of diverse diseases. Clinical trials have been carried out with the proteasome inhibitor PS-341. This displays anti-tumor activity and has been approved for therapy of patients with multiple myeloma (6Richardson P.G.

Ubiquitin is then transferred from the E1 to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). A ubiquitin ligase (E3) then facilitates transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 to the substrate. There is one human ubiquitin E1 and multiple ubiquitin E2s (10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar, 11Jones D. Crowe E. Stevens T.A. Candido E.P. Genome Biology. 2002; (http://genomebiology.com/2001/3/1/RESEARCH/0002)Google Scholar). Mdm2 acts as an E3 ligase for p53 (12Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar) and can promote its ubiquitination and degradation in vivo (13Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Mdm2 also “auto-ubiquitinates” and is itself targeted for degradation by the proteasome (15Xirodimas D. Saville M.K. Edling C. Lane D.P. Lain S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4972-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating p53 protein expression Mdm2 can inhibit p53 transcriptional activity by binding to its transactivation domain (16Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 17Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that Mdm2 can promote conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated) to p53 (19Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Bourdon J.C. Hay R.T. Lane D.P. Cell. 2004; 118: 83-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This modification also represses the transcriptional activity of p53. The relative contribution to inhibition of p53 of Mdm2-dependent ubiquitin and NEDD8 conjugation and transcriptional repression through direct binding to p53 are not clear. Loss of Mdm2 in mice is embryonic lethal in a p53-dependent manner (20Jones S.N. Roe A.E. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 378: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 21Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In transgenic adult mice, which express lower levels of Mdm2 than wild-type mice, the transactivation and apoptotic activities of p53 are enhanced (22Mendrysa S.M. McElwee M.K. Michalowski J. O'Leary K.A. Young K.M. Perry M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Agents that bind to Mdm2 and block its association with p53 increase both the levels and transcriptional activity of p53 in vivo. These include high affinity Mdm2 binding peptides, the Mdm2-specific antibody 3G5 (23Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and the Nutlin family of small molecules (24Vassilev L.T. Vu B.T. Graves B. Carvajal D. Podlaski F. Filipovic Z. Kong N. Kammlott U. Lukacs C. Klein C. Fotouhi N. Liu E.A. Science. 2004; 303: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (3732) Google Scholar). These and other observations indicate that Mdm2 is a key negative regulator of p53 (25Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 26Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Mdm2 is itself a target for p53 transcriptional regulation. Mdm2 is induced by p53 resulting in a negative feedback loop (27Lane D.P. Hall P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 372-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Mdm2 structural homologue MdmX is also an important regulator of p53. MdmX binds to p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity but does not itself ubiquitinate p53 in cells (28Stad R. Little N.A. Xirodimas D.P. Frenk R. van der Eb A.J. Lane D.P. Saville M.K. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), although a low level of E3 ligase activity has been observed in vitro (29Badciong J.C. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49668-49675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mdm2 and MdmX heterodimerize through their ring fingers (30Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Strikingly, ablation of MdmX also results in p53-dependent embryonic lethality in mice (31Parant J. Chavez-Reyes A. Little N.A. Yan W. Reinke V. Jochemsen A.G. Lozano G. Nat.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the E2 specificity of Mdm2 has not been investigated in detail, and the one or more ubiquitin E2s involved in regulating the Mdm2/p53 pathway in intact cells have not been determined previously. Ubiquitin E2s consist of a conserved core domain of ∼150 amino acids. They have an active site cysteine residue, which forms a thiolester bond with ubiquitin transferred from the E1. Ubiquitination, and by inference ubiquitin E2s, are involved in regulating many cellular processes. However, the precise physiological roles of many of the ubiquitin E2s are not well defined, particularly in mammalian cells. There is evidence that E2s have unique functions, presumably arising from their specificity for particular E3s. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that Ubc2 (RAD6) is central to DNA repair, Ubc3 (CDC34) is required for the G1-S transition, and Ubc4/5 are required for viability (10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar).Regulation of E2 levels or activity could provide a mechanism to alter the stability of key proteins. Studies using rat tissue extracts indicate that E2s can be rate-limiting for ubiquitination (35Rajapurohitam V. Bedard N. Wing S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E739-E745Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The expression of S. cerevisiae Ubc4 and -5 is growth- and heat shock-regulated (36Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The levels of specific mammalian E2s have also been reported to be regulated by the cell cycle and by agents, including interferons α and γ, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1, amyloid-β, and herpes simplex virus (37Wing S.S.

Eye Res. 2004; 78: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E2 activity can be influenced by phosphorylation. CDC34 and its homologue Ubc3b are substrates for protein kinase CK2 (46Semplici F. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Oliviero S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3978-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and UbcH1 (HHR6) is phosphorylated by CDK1 and -2 (47Sarcevic B. Mawson A. Baker R.T. Sutherland R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In this study we identified ubiquitin E2s involved in the Mdm2/p53 pathway in intact cells. A panel of E2s were tested for their ability to support the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2 in vitro. We show that there is specificity in E2 usage by Mdm2. Of the E2s tested only members of the UbcH5 family (A-C) and E2-25K are able to support the ubiquitin ligase activity of Mdm2. We observed that the pattern of Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 in vitro is dependent on the E2 used. Using siRNA-mediated knockdown we show that UbcH5B/C make a significant contribution to the maintenance of low levels of Mdm2 and p53 in unstressed cells. In contrast, suppression of UbcH5A or E2-25K has little effect on expression of Mdm2 and p53 in the cell lines examined. Levels of UbcH5B/C protein expression were found to be higher than those of UbcH5A, possibly accounting for the preferential usage of UbcH5B/C in intact cells. The balance of activities of the Mdm2/p53 pathway is such that the p53 accumulated following UbcH5B/C knockdown is not transcriptionally active, the level of Mdm2 being sufficient to maintain transcriptional repression of p53. We find that expression of UbcH5B/C is reduced by the p53 stabilizing therapeutic drugs doxorubicin and actinomycin D. Because p53 expression is sensitive to the levels of UbcH5B/C, it is conceivable that E2 regulation could play some part in signaling to the p53 pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The antibodies used were 4B2 for Mdm2; DO-1 for p53 unless otherwise indicated; H-81 for CDC34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); UBC4 (C-15) for UbcH5B/C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was precleared by absorption with GST-UbcH5A; Ab-1 for p21 (Oncogene); L27 for CD20 (BD Biosciences); and Ab-1 for actin (Calbiochem).

UbcH5A cDNA was donated by Dr. R. T. Hay. These were used as templates for PCR, and the products were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T with the exception of HHR6A, which was cloned into the SmaI and EcoRI sites. pT7-7-Mdm2 used for bacterial expression of human Mdm2 was described previously (34Midgley C.A.

Recently, we have shown that LPA-induced transactivation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β is regulated by phospholipase D2 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) (Wang, L., Cummings, R. J., Zhao, Y., Kazlauskas, A., Sham, J., Morris, A., Brindley, D. N., Georas, S., and Natarajan, V. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 39931-39940). Here, we report that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) mediates LPA-induced NF-κB transcription and interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion in HBEpCs. Treatment of HBEpCs with LPA increased both IL-8 gene and protein expression, which was coupled to Gi and G12/13 proteins. LPA caused a marked activation of NF-κB in HBEpCs as determined by IκB phosphorylation and of NF-κB nuclear translocation and a strong induction of NF-κB promoter-mediated luciferase activity. Furthermore, LPA-activated PKCδ and the LPA-mediated activation of NF-κB and IL-8 production were attenuated by overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ and rottlerin. Intratracheal administration of LPA in mice resulted in elevated levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-2, a murine homolog of IL-8, and an influx of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These results demonstrate for the first time that LPA is a potent stimulator of IL-8 production in HBEpCs, which involves PKCδ/NF-κB signaling pathways.

The respiratory epithelium, a complex physical and biochemical barrier, has the capacity both to initiate inflammatory responses and to participate in repair. The balance between the protective, physiological inflammatory response and injurious, pathological inflammation involves coordinating the production of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors (1Polito A.J. Proud D. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1998; 102: 714-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The innate immune response is of relatively short duration and involves increased vascular transudation, interstitial edema, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, predominantly of neutrophils. Initiation and maintenance of this leukocyte recruitment requires intercellular communication between infiltrating neutrophils, the endothelium, and respiratory epithelial cells. In this light, the airway epithelium plays a pivotal role in this response through its reaction to and secretion of necessary intercellular regulatory molecules.

Protein kinase C (PKC) belongs to a homologous serine/threonine kinase family that includes three classes of isoenzymes in which the functional specificity is determined by their subcellular localization. The groups consist of the calcium-, phorbol ester-, and phosphatidylserine-activated classical isoforms (α, β, and γ); the calcium-insensitive and phorbol esterand phosphatidylserine-activated novel isoforms (δ, ϵ, η, θ, and μ); and the phosphatidylserine-activated and calcium- and phorbol ester-insensitive atypical isoforms (ζ and ι/λ). It has recently been shown that PKCδ regulates ICAM-1 expression via NF-κB activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (29Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Uddin S. Xu N. Ye R.D. Platanias L.C. Malik A.B. Mol. Cell.

These earlier reports support the notion that LPA plays a role in the innate immune response. In this study, we utilized a primary HBEpC culture system to analyze LPA-induced IL-8 secretion. In addition to potent and specific production of IL-8, extracellular LPA stimulated IκB phosphorylation, NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and NF-κB nuclear translocation. The overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ significantly attenuated LPA-mediated IκB phosphorylation, NF-κB translocation, and IL-8 secretion. We also supplemented our cell culture experiments with in vivo studies. Intratracheally delivered LPA in C57BL/6J mice resulted in significant elevations of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and a neutrophilic influx in the BAL fluid from these animals. Together, these data indicate that PKCδ plays a key role in the regulation of LPA-mediated IL-8 production via NF-κB activation in primary HBEpCs and that extracellular LPA produces an analogous inflammatory response in vivo.

All primary cell cultures were grown in BEGM in 35- or 60-mm dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Experiments with HBEpCs were conducted between passages 0 and 4 at 70-90% confluence. Measurement of IL-8 Secretion—HBEpCs were pretreated in BEGM with or without PTx (100 ng/ml), rottlerin (5 μm), or bisindolylmaleimide (1 μm) for 1 h prior to stimulation. The pretreatment media were removed, and the cells were treated in BEGM containing 0.1% BSA with or without LPA at the indicated concentrations for the specified lengths of time. Cell supernatants were removed, centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and frozen at -80 °C for later analysis for IL-8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE, International, Camarillo, CA). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HBEpCs grown on coverslips to ∼50% confluence were infected with a vector control or dominant-negative (dn) PKCδ (multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) = 25) for 48 h prior to challenge with LPA (1 μm) for 15 min. In some experiments without infection with adenoviral constructs, ∼80% confluent cells were used for LPA challenge. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100. The cells were stained for 20 min with a 1:200 dilution of either anti-PKCδ or anti-NF-κB subunit (p65RelA) antibody in TBST containing 1% BSA. The cells were thoroughly rinsed with TBST and stained for 30 min with a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 in TBST containing 1% BSA. Cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S immunofluorescence microscope and a Hamamatsu digital camera with a ×60 oil immersion objective and Meta Vue software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Cytokine Gene Expression by cDNA Array Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from HBEpCs using an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN Inc., Los Angeles, CA) following vehicle or LPA treatment. Aliquots of total RNA (10 μg) were used to analyze the differential gene expression of common cytokines using Nonrad-GEArray technology (Super Array Inc., Bethesda, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, biotinylated cDNA probes were prepared using total RNA as a template by reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Following denaturation, the cDNA probes were hybridized to a positively charged nylon membrane containing the arrayed DNA. After blocking and incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and chemiluminescent substrate, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film. Gene expression was quantified by scanning densitometry and normalized based on the intensity of hybridization signals to the housekeeping genes β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The experiment was performed three times to ensure reproducibility of results. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—HBEpCs were rinsed two times with ice-cold PBS; scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH, 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin); incubated at 4 °C for 20 min; and cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After determination of the total protein in the lysates by the BCA method, 6× Laemmli sample buffer was added to cell lysates, and the lysates were boiled for 5 min. Equally loaded proteins were separated on 12% gels by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PKCα (1:1000 dilution), anti-PKCδ (1:1000 dilution), or anti-PKCϵ (1:1000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-PKCζ (1:1000 dilution), anti-PKCθ (1:500 dilution), or anti-PKCι/λ (1:500 dilution) (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed at least three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated for 2-4 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000 dilution in TBST containing 5% BSA) or goat anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk) secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed using the ECL kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HBEpCs according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif North America, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold PBS with phosphatase inhibitors and pelleted by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 1× hypotonic buffer and incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by addition of 25 μl of detergent and high speed vortexing for 30 s following the manufacturer's recommendation. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C; the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer A and incubated on ice for 15 min. This suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for further analysis. Protein in the nuclear extract was quantified by BCA protein assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The probe for EMSA was a 22-bp double-stranded construct of NF-κB consensus binding sequence (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). End labeling of the probe was performed using T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts (4 μg) from vector control- or dn-PKCδ adenovirus-infected cells with or without LPA treatment and binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μg of the nonspecific blocker poly(dI-dC), and 20,000 dpm of γ-32P-labeled probe at 37 °C for 30 min. Specific competition was performed by adding 200 ng of unlabeled 22-bp double-stranded probe. The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. Transfection and Viral Infection—For transient transfection, HBEpCs grown in 6-well plates (∼60% confluent) were transfected with G-protein minigene vectors (Cue Biotech, Chicago, IL). The minigene vectors contain oligonucleotides ligated into pcDNA3.1 that encode a unique peptide that specifically blocks the receptor/G-protein interface. The minigene plasmids (1 μg of cDNA) were mixed with 3 μl of FuGENE 6/well in 1 ml of BEGM, and transfections were performed for 4 h. At the end of 4 h, the transfection medium was aspirated; regular BEGM (2 ml) was added; and cells were incubated for additional 24 h. Infection of HBEpCs (∼60% confluent) in 35- or 60-mm dishes was carried out with purified kinase-negative adenoviral vectors of PKC isoforms as described previously (33Kuroki T. Kashiwagi M. Ishino K. Huh N. Ohba M. J. Investig. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1999; 4: 153-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Following infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell in 1 ml of BEGM for 24 h, the virus-containing medium was replaced with complete BEGM, and experiments were performed. PKCδ Kinase Assay—HBEpCs infected with vector or dn-PKCδ adenoviruses (m.o.i. = 50) for 24 h were challenged with medium alone or medium containing LPA (1 μm) for 15 min prior to harvesting. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors from EDTA-free Complete tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Lysates (500 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ antibody (10 μl) overnight at 4 °C, followed by addition of protein A/G (40 μl) and incubation for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer B and two times with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 200 μl of kinase buffer. The activity of PKCδ was measured in 100 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 μg of myelin basic protein as an exogenous substrate to which 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP containing unlabeled ATP (10 μm; final specific activity of 10,000 dpm/pmol), 2 μg of diacylglycerol, 12 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 25 μl of immunoprecipitate were added. Incubations were carried out for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Aliquots (25-50 μl) of the reaction mixture were spotted onto P-81 filter paper and washed three times with 1% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectroscopy. LPA Instillation and Bronchoalveolar Lavage—Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 30 μl of 10:1 ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg). LPA (10 μm) was administered intranasally after sonication in physiological saline containing tissue culture-grade 0.1% BSA, whereas the control mice received saline plus 0.1% BSA. BAL was performed 3 or 6 h following vehicle or LPA instillation. After the mice were killed with an intraperitoneal overdose of urethane (3 g/kg of body weight), the trachea was cannulated with an 18-gauge intracatheter, and the lungs were lavaged with three 1-ml aliquots of physiological saline (3 ml total). BAL fluids were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was immediately resuspended in physiological saline for total cell counts. Differential cell counts were carried out in the centrifuged cells after Wright-Giemsa staining. The supernatant were frozen at -80 °C for later measurements of MIP-2 and total protein. Statistical Analysis of Data—S.D. for each data point was calculated from triplicate samples. Unless stated otherwise, data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance, and pairwise multiple comparison was done by Dunnett's method with p < 0.05. LPA Activates IL-8 in Primary HBEpCs—We have recently reported that the bioactive sphingolipid S1P stimulates IL-8 production in BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells (21Cummings R.J. Parinandi N.L. Zaiman A. Wang L. Usatyuk P.V. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30227-30235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Extracellular LPA has been shown to be an immunological regulator by activating NF-κB and increasing levels of mRNA transcripts encoding E-selectin, ICAM-1, IL-8, and MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in endothelial cells (17Postma F.R. Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Bot A.G. Alblas J. de Jonge H.R. Moolenaar W.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, LPA has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in fibroblasts (10Li N. Wang M. Oberley T.D. Sempf J.M. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4531-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We examined the ability of both S1P and LPA to modulate IL-8 secretion in HBEpCs. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of HBEpCs with S1P (1 μm) resulted in significant increases in IL-8 secretion at both 3 and 24 h (2.6- and 1.8-fold over control levels, respectively). Interestingly, LPA treatment (1 μm) produced an even greater induction of IL-8 secretion of 4.8-fold at 3 h and 2.2-fold at 24 h (Fig. 1). Treatment of HBEpCs with LPA for 3 h resulted in dose-dependent secretion of IL-8 (Fig. 2A) with significant production at 10 nm (1.4-fold over control levels) and a 4.1-fold increase over control levels at 1 μm. These concentrations are within reported physiological concentrations of LPA found in human serum (34Xu Y. Shen Z. Wiper D.W. Wu M. Morton R.E. Elson P. Kennedy A.W. Belinson J. Markman M. Casey G. J. Am. Mol. Assoc. 1998; 280: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The release of IL-8 into the medium by HBEpCs upon stimulation with LPA (1 μm) significantly increased after 3 h (3.4-fold) and reached a maximum at 12 h (Fig. 2B). LPA-induced IL-8 Gene Expression—To compare the effect of LPA treatment on production of IL-8 with that of other cytokines, we utilized cytokine-specific cDNA technology. Total RNA from vehicle-treated versus LPA-treated (1 μm, 3 h) HBEpCs was isolated and analyzed for differential cytokine gene expression. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), among the 23 different cytokines examined, only the expression of IL-8 was increased (11.5-fold) relative to control cells. HBEpCs produced basal amounts of IL-1α (spot pair 1) and TNF-α (spot pair 22), which were not affected by LPA treatment. These striking data indicate that LPA specifically up-regulates IL-8 gene expression in HBEpCs. G-protein Coupling Involved in LPA-induced IL-8 Secretion—We have previously identified the expression of LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 receptors in HBEpCs using reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry (20Wang L. Cummings R.J. Zhao Y. Kazlauskas A. Sham J. Morris A. Brindley D.N. Georas S. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39931-39940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further examine which member(s) of the heterotrimeric G-protein family is responsible for LPA-mediated IL-8 secretion, we investigated the effects of inhibition of LPA receptor/G-protein-coupled signaling. Treatment of HBEpCs with PTx (100 ng/ml) for 3 h, which uncouples G-protei"

In addition, Lys-4-methylated H3 is required for maintenance of silencing at the telomeres, rDNA, and HML locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular mechanism underlying the role of Set1p in silencing is not known. Here we report that euchromatic methylation of H3 Lys-4 is necessary to maintain silencing at specific heterochromatic sites. Inactivation of Set1p catalytic activity or mutation of H3 Lys-4 leads to decreased binding of the silent information regulator Sir3p at heterochromatic sites. Concomitantly, there is an increase in the amount of Sir3p bound to genes located in subtelomeric regions. Consistent with this result is the finding that in vitro, Sir3p preferentially binds histone H3 tails when methylation is absent at H3 Lys-4, a situation found in heterochromatin. The inability of Sir3p to bind methylated H3 Lys-4 tails suggests a model whereby H3 Lys-4 methylation prevents Sir3p association at euchromatic sites and therefore concentrates Sir3p at unmodified, heterochromatic regions of the genome.

Eukaryotic chromatin undergoes global changes in the level of condensation as cells progress from metaphase to interphase. Besides this general tendency, local chromosomal domains present different levels of organization (for review, see Refs. 1Labrador M. Corces V.G. Cell. 2002; 111: 151-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar and 2Jackson D.A. Chromosome Res. 2003; 11: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Heterochromatin was originally identified cytologically as the portion of the genome that remains condensed after the transition from metaphase to interphase. These regions correspond to telomeres and pericentric chromosomal areas and generally localize attached to the perinuclear compartment. Heterochromatic areas tend to be rich in repetitive sequences, low in gene content (although not depleted of them), transcriptionally silent or showing a variegating phenotype, and typically late to replicate. On the other hand, euchromatin, which may be considered the rest of the genome, de-condenses during interphase, contains most of the genes, is active or proficient for transcription, and replicates early. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a mild chromosomal condensation prior to mitosis and does not fulfill all the criteria of higher eukaryote heterochromatin. However, telomeres, ribosomal DNA clusters, and mating type loci present many heterochromatic features. For example, ectopic genes inserted into these sites of the genome exhibit a strong reduction in the expression levels compared with their naturally occurring euchromatic locus. This position effect in gene expression reflects differences in the chromatin (for review, see Ref. 3Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the establishment of silencing is controlled by cis-acting factors called “silencers” and trans-acting proteins that bind to these sites (Rap1, Abf1, and the origin of replication complex). A variety of other proteins including Sir2p, Sir3p, Sir4p, histone H3, and histone H4 are necessary for transcriptional silencing (for review, see Ref. 3Rusche L.N. Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 481-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 proteins spread from the silencing initiation site along chromatin by direct binding of Sir3p and Sir4p with the histone H3 and H4 NH2-terminal tails (4Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 5Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The pattern of posttranslational modifications exhibited by H3 and H4 is crucial for efficient spreading of the silencing. Nucleosomes at heterochromatic sites are hypoacetylated, and experiments in vitro demonstrate that Sir3p binds with higher affinity to unacetylated H4 amino-terminal peptides than it does to acetylated ones (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and mostly Lys-16) (6Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Notably, the silent information regulator Sir2p is a NAD-dependent histone deacetylase that maintains hypoacetylated nucleosomes at silent sites by antagonizing the histone acetyltransferase activity of Sas2p (7Kimura A. Umehar T. Horikoshi M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 8Suka N. Luo K. Grunstein M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition to Sas2p, other members of the MYST family of acetyltransferases (MOZ, Ybfz/Sas3, Tip60) are involved in silencing in yeasts and higher eukaryotes (for review, see Ref. 9Carrozza M.J. Utley R.T. Workman J.L. Cote J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The proposed model to explain why acetyltransferases are necessary to maintain silencing is that the heavily acetylated euchromatin creates a suboptimal environment for the silencing complexes to spread by association with the histones H3 and H4. This leads to an accumulation of the silencers at the heterochromatic sites. Loss of histone acetyltransferase activity presumably allows Sir protein complexes to spread further afield, resulting in a reduced amount of these complexes at heterochromatic areas. These lower levels are insufficient for sustaining the repression of transcription (10Kristjuhan A. Wittschieben B.O. Walker J. Roberts D. Cairns B.R. Svejstrup J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7551-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 11Grunstein M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Histone lysine methylation has also been linked to heterochromatin formation and silencing (for review, see Ref. 12Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The Set1 protein methylates lysine 4 on histone H3 in S. cerevisiae (13Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). This modification fully activates transcription of many genes, in part by facilitating the recruitment of the chromatin-remodeling ATPase Isw1p to chromatin (15Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 16Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R.

In addition, several groups have reported a role for Set1p in silencing at the rDNA tandem repeats (14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), telomeres (17Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the role of Set1p in silencing at the rDNA seems to be independent of Sir2p (19Bryk M. Briggs S.D. Strahl B.D. Curcio M.J. Allis C.D. Winston F. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the amount of Sir2p associated to telomeres is synergistically reduced by mutations on Dot1p (lysine 79 H3 methyltransferase) and Set1p (lysine 4 H3 methyltransferase) (20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This suggests that methylation at both Lys-4 and Lys-79 contributes to the maintenance of silencing by concentrating silencing proteins at heterochromatic sites (20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Here, evidence is presented that mutation of the Set1p catalytic site results in a decrease in the amount of Sir3p at several heterochromatic sites, re-distribution of the Sir3p protein in the nucleus, and loss of silencing. In vitro, recombinant Sir3p exhibits a direct binding preference for non-H3 Lys-4-methylated peptides, supporting a model in which silencing complexes cluster at heterochromatic sites by interaction with a hypoacetylated and hypomethylated chromatin. Our results suggest that H3 Lys-4 methylation is necessary at euchromatic areas to maintain silencing at heterochromatic areas.

Gottschiling); 3 μl of Pan-anti-acetyl H4 antibody (B. Turner), and 3 μl of anti-acetylated Lys-9/H3 Lys-14 antibody (Upstate). Standard PCR analysis (30–33 cycles) was done on 1:10, 1:20, and 1:50 dilutions of the input, antibody-precipitated DNA, and control without antibody. Real time PCR analysis was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 (ABI) using Sybr Green. A standard curve of WT yeast genomic DNA diluted 1:10, 1:20, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000 was done for each amplicon. Amplification within the linear range was obtained with the input chromatin diluted 1:30 and IPs diluted 1:2 (anti-HA and mono-Me Lys-4 antibodies), 1:100 (anti-di-Me and -tri-Me Lys-4 antibodies), and 1:20 (anti-Rap1 and anti-acetyl H3 and H4 antibodies). Control IPs were done with anti-HA antibody from the untagged strain. PCR was done in triplicate and the experiments were repeated in two different strains. After each run, a melting curve was performed to ensure that no primer dimers contaminated the quantification and that the product had the expected melting temperature. Samples were also subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the integrity of the product. A signal was calculated from the average of at least three dilutions of IP, control IP (no antibody), or input and then corrected for the dilution factor when the appropriate dilutions showed a linear relationship and the PCR reaction was exponential. Relative fluorescent intensities are calculated as follows: ((ΣIP signals/ΣIP samples) or (Σno Ab signals/Σno Ab samples))/(Σinput signals/Σinput samples), where Σ is signals and Ab is antibody. The variability was less than 10% of the value shown between the different immunoprecipitations. The primers used for PCR analysis are available on request. Western Blot—Western blot of total yeast extracts was performed using standard procedures. The membranes were blocked for 3 h in Tris-buffered saline, 7% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. The antibodies (diluted 1:1000, ≅4 °C) used were: anti-Sir2 (sc-6667, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Sir4 (sc-6671, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Rap1 (S. Schawalder), anti-HA (number 1666606, Roche), anti-Tub1 (Ab 6161, AbCam), and anti-Dot1 (Ab 4164, AbCam). In Vitro Binding—To monitor the binding of Sir3p to the H3 amino-terminal tail, we synthesized peptides corresponding to amino acids 1–16 of H3, either unmodified or trimethylated at Lys-4. The peptides contained a single cysteine residue at the COOH terminus. The carboxyl-terminal half of Sir3p (amino acids 510–970) was expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion and purified on reduced glutathione-Sepharose beads. The fusion protein was eluted from the bead and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% v/v surfactant P20 (buffer X). The H3 NH2-terminal peptides were cross-linked via their COOH-terminal Cys residue, using standard electronic data capture/NHS technology, to the interaction surface of carboxymethyl dextran cells (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). The cells were then placed in an IASYS Plus surface plasmon resonance instrument, and interactions with Sir3p were monitored under standard conditions in buffer X. The Set1p Methyltransferase Activity Is Necessary for Silencing at Telomeres and HML but Not at the HMR Locus—We have previously reported that Set1p activity is necessary for the optimal transcription of many genes in S. cerevisiae. To analyze the role of lysine 4 (Lys-4) H3 methylation in silencing, we used the set1C1068A point mutant. This mutant associates with the Set1p complex, but it is catalytically inactive for H3 Lys-4 mono-, di-, and trimethyltransferase activities (16Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A. Weise C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Isogenic WT and set1C1068A strains carry a URA3 reporter at the naturally occurring locus (euchromatic site). At telomere 07-L, HML and HMR loci (heterochromatic sites) were tested for silencing by their ability to grow in fluoro-orotic acid-containing plates. Fig. 1A shows that mutation of SET1 causes loss of silencing at the telomere of chromosome VII and HML. This result corroborates data found with the set1α strain (17Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Krogan N.J. Dover J. Khorrami S. Greenblatt J.F. Schneider J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Interestingly, silencing at the HMR locus is not affected by mutation of SET1. The different behavior of the HML and HMR alleles regarding silencing has also been reported in relation to other locus-specific regulators (22Ehrenhofer-Murray A.E. Rivier D.H. Rine J. Genetics. 1997; 145: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Xu E.Y. Kim S. Rivier D.H. Genetics. 1999; 153: 25-33PubMed Google Scholar). Heterochromatic Sites Are Hypomodified for H3 Lys-4 Mono-, Di-, and Trimethylation—To understand how Set1p contributes to silencing, we monitored the H3 Lys-4 methylation state of the reporter URA3 gene located at euchromatic and heterochromatic sites (euchromatic-ChrV, telomere 07-L, and HML and HMR loci). The pattern of mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3 Lys-4 found on the inactive and active URA3 gene (Fig. 1B, left and right panels, respectively) revealed that only the euchromatic site is hypermethylated (relative fluorescence units above 1.0). All heterochromatic sites studied were hypomethylated. The level of methylation was inversely correlated to the strength of silencing, suggesting that the presence of H3 Lys-4 methylation in heterochromatin is not required for gene silencing. To further analyze this, the H3 Lys-4 methylation levels at several nucleosomes from 5′ (nucleosome +1) to 3′ (nucleosome +6) of the URA3 gene were determined (Fig. 1C). No methylation was found at the heterochromatic HMLα-E site, in contrast to the characteristic accumulation of methylated H3 Lys-4 at the 5′ end of the euchromatic URA3 gene (Fig. 1C) (24Ng H.H. Robert F. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 709-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These results indicate that silencing in heterochromatin is not a result of Set1p activity on the silent sites. Because Set1p activates transcription of many genes, we tested whether the defect in silencing in the set1C1068A strain was due to a general decrease in the levels of silencing proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, the levels of Rap1, Sir2p, Sir4p, and HA-Sir3p were equivalent in total extracts of SET1 and isogenic set1C1068A strains. Thus, Set1p does not contribute to silencing by regulating the expression of the main silencing factors. Mutation of SET1 Affects the Sir3p Occupancy at Several Heterochromatic Sites—It has been reported that mutations in the histone-modifying enzymes responsible for acetylation of H3 and H4, as well as methylation of H3 Lys-79, affect silencing by decreasing the amount of Sir proteins at the heterochromatic sites (10Kristjuhan A. Wittschieben B.O. Walker J. Roberts D. Cairns B.R. Svejstrup J.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7551-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The current model is that hyperacetylated H3 and H4 (in particular H4 Lys-16) and hypermethylated H3 Lys-79 create a suboptimal environment for the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins to spread. The silencing factors are therefore restricted to heterochromatic areas, which are hypoacetylated and hypomethylated at Lys-79. We sought to determine whether this is the case for H3 Lys-4 methylation. Sir3p was analyzed because it is necessary for the spreading of silencing via direct interaction with the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 (4Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). As a reference, the amount of Sir3p was determined at the euchromatic WHI3 gene, which has previously been shown to bind the Sir3p protein (25Lieb J.D. Liu X. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The amount of Sir3p found at WHI3 was arbitrarily ascribed a value of 1 (Fig. 2A). As expected, Sir3p was concentrated at heterochromatic sites relative to the amount at WHI3 or another euchromatic gene, MPP10 (Fig. 2A). The comparative analysis of a WT strain and an isogenic set1C1068A mutant (Fig. 2B) revealed a clear reduction in the amount of Sir3p bound to chromatin, which decreased 20–45% depending on the heterochromatic site analyzed. However, at one heterochromatic site, the HMR locus, a reduction was not observed. This was consistent with our finding that silencing at HMR does not depend on Set1p (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the amounts of Sir3p bound to the HML site and to the TEL07L::URA3 maker were also reduced (30–50%) in an H3 K4R mutant with respect to the isogenic WT strain (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, no difference in the binding of Sir3p at the HMR site was observed. It is noteworthy that the binding of Sir3p to heterochromatic sites is more severely affected in the set1C1068A than in the H3 K4R mutant (Fig. 2, compare B with D), despite the fact that the H3 K4R mutation abolishes telomeric silencing (data not shown). This may be because the Set1p complex is non-functional in the set1C1068A mutant compared with the H3 K4R mutant, suggesting that in the set1C1068A strain other members of the complex may contribute to Sir3p redistribution. Alternatively, H3 harboring the K4R mutation may not bind Sir3p as well as unmethylated H3, though this binding is still better than to methylated H3 Lys-4. This would result in a milder titration of Sir3p from heterochromatic areas in the H3 K4R mutant than the set1C1068A. The decrease in the amount of Sir3p bound to TEL06R concurs with an increase of Sir3p on a subtelomeric gene located 5 kb apart (Fig. 2B, YFR055w). Also PHO11, a classic subtelomeric gene located 3.5 kb from the telomeric end of chromosome I, shows a clear increase in Sir3p upon mutation of SET1. This suggests that the lack of H3 Lys-4 methylation allows Sir3p to spread out of the heterochromatic regions. A significant increase in the amount of Sir3p at scattered euchromatic loci (for instance MPP10 (Fig. 2B) and WHI3 (data not shown)) was not observed, possibly reflecting the limiting amount of Sir3p in the cell. The Effect of Set1p in Silencing Is Not Because of Changes in Acetylation or H3 Lys-79 Methylation—One possibility was that the effect of set1C1068A in Sir3p occupancy may have resulted from changes in H3 and/or H4 acetylation, which in turn could have affected the interaction of Sir3p with histones at heterochromatic sites. To rule out this possibility, ChIP was performed with antibodies specific for acetylated H4 (Pan anti-acetylated H4) and acetylated H3 Lys-9 and Lys-14. The levels of H3 and H4 acetylation at euchromatic (hyperacetylated) and heterochromatic (hypoacetylated) sites were comparable in WT and the set1C1068A mutant (Fig. 2, E and F). Hence, the effect of Set1p in silencing does not seem to be mediated by histone acetylation. Whether set1C1068A could affect the amount of Dot1p in the cell (and therefore cause hypomethylation of H3 Lys-79) was then checked. Neither the amount of Dot1p (as detected by Western blot) nor the global genome levels of H3 Lys-79 methylation were affected by the set1C1068A mutation (data not shown). In addition, it has been reported that a dot1 set1 double knock-out strain shows a synergism occupying Sir2p at heterochromatin with respect to the single deleted strains supporting individual roles for Set1p and Dot1p in the maintenance of silencing (20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We conclude that the role of Set1p in silencing is mainly linked to the H3 Lys-4 methyltransferase activity of Set1p. Mutation of SET1 Affects the in Vivo Sir3p Localization— Sir3p localization in the cell gives rise to a very characteristic pattern of perinuclear foci. These foci represent an accumulation of Sir3p at the telomeres of chromosomes (26Palladino F. Laroche T. Gilson E. Axelrod A. Pillus L. Gasser S.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 543-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Mutations in several genes that affect silencing alter the intracellular distribution of Sir3p (27Laroche T. Martin S.G. Gotta M. Gorham H.C. Pryde F.E. Louis E.J. Gasser S.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a decrease in the binding of Sir3p was observed at telomeres of chromosomes VII and VI in the set1C1068A strain, we analyzed the distribution of a functional GFP-Sir3 protein in WT versus the set1C1068A mutant. Fig. 3A shows that the clear perinuclear Sir3p foci, observed in a WT strain, is replaced by a more dispersed localization that often appears to fill the nucleus. Thus, in agreement with our ChIP data, the set1C1068A mutation affects the intracellular distribution of Sir3p in vivo. Overexpression of Sir3p Rescues the Silencing Defects on set1C1068A Strains—It was hypothesized that the silencing defect observed in the set1C1068A mutant could be suppressed by overexpression of Sir3p. To test this hypothesis, the SIR3 open reading frame was cloned under the control of the galactose-induced GAL1/10 promoter, and the protein from a 2-micron plasmid was expressed. As shown in Fig. 3B, the set1C1068A strain is defective in silencing at the telomere VII when grown on glucose-containing plates (non-overexpression of Sir3p). However, the silencing defect is almost completely rescued when the same strain is supplemented with a mixture of galactose and raffinose as the carbon source (Sir3p overexpression). This supports a model for H3 Lys-4 methylation maintaining silencing by concentrating the Sir proteins at heterochromatic sites. Lys-4 Methylation Abrogates Binding of Recombinant Sir3 to the Amino-terminal Tail of H3 in Vitro—It has been shown that the COOH terminus of Sir3p directly binds to the first 20 or so NH2-terminal amino acids of histone H3 (4Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 5Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Thus, one mechanism by which H3 Lys-4 methylation could occlude Sir3 from euchromatin but allow binding to heterochromatin would be by direct disruption of Sir3p binding to histone H3 tails. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine whether methylation of H3 Lys-4 affects binding of Sir3p to H3 tails. The COOH terminus of Sir3p (amino acids 510–970) bound with a higher affinity to unmodified H3 tail than to peptides trimethylated at Lys-4 (Fig. 3C). This interaction appears to be stable because bound Sir3p dissociates slowly (Fig. 3D). Thus, methylation at H3 Lys-4 inhibits Sir3p binding, which is consistent with our observations that the in vivo localization of Sir3p is disrupted when H3 Lys-4 methylation is lost. Several laboratories have reported that mutations of the H3 Lys-4 methyltransferase Set1p affect silencing at different heterochromatic locations (14Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 17Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10753-10755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The molecular basis underlying these observations remained elusive. Here it is shown that yeast lacking methylation of H3 Lys-4 displays defects in silencing at several heterochromatic sites by decreasing the amount of the silent information regulator protein Sir3p at these heterochromatic positions. Concurrently, an increase in the amount of Sir3p at adjacent subtelomeric loci is observed, which suggests that Sir3p spreads outside of the heterochromatic locations. The direct connection between Sir3p-induced silencing and H3 Lys-4 methylation comes from two experiments. First, the silencing defect observed in the catalytically inactive Set1p enzyme can be reversed by overexpression of Sir3p. Second, H3 Lys-4 methylation is shown to prevent the direct association of Sir3p with histone H3 tails. In addition to our data on Sir3p, it has been reported that there is a mild but significant decrease in the amount of Sir2p at telomeres in H3 Lys-4 methyltransferase-deficient strains (20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This effect is synergistic with a lack of H3 Lys-79 methylation with respect to the amount of Sir2p bound to telomeres. A stronger defect was observed in the association of Sir3p with heterochromatin in the set1C1068A mutant than that observed for Sir2p in the strain deleted for SET1 (20Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33625-33628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This variability could reflect differences in the affinity of Sir3p and Sir4p (which recruits Sir2p to heterochromatin) for methylated H3 Lys-4, the existence of additional interactions between Sir4p and heterochromatin, or even differences due to the presence of a non-functional methyltransferase complex in the cell (set1C1068A) versus the lack of the complex, as occurs in the SET1 knock-out strain. In any case, these results strongly suggest that the Sir proteins display a higher affinity for non-methylated histones versus highly methylated histones, as is the case for non-acetylated versus acetylated histones (5Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Nature. 1996; 383: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 6Carmen A.A. Milne L. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4778-4781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed a loss of interaction between H3 Lys-4-methylated amino-terminal tails and recombinant Sir3p in vitro. Thus, the presence of highly modified (acetylated or methylated) histones in euchromatic areas may prevent silencing factors from spreading out of heterochromatic sites. This could be a substitute mechanism to maintain silent domains of chromatin in organisms like S. cerevisiae, which lack modifications more specific to heterochromatin such as H3 Lys-9 methylation and DNA methylation.

https://openalex.org/W2056496442,"Leukotrienes (LTs) are lipid messengers generated by leukocytes that drive inflammation and modulate neighboring cell function. The synthesis of LTs from arachidonic acid is initiated by the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). We report for the first time that LT synthesis is inhibited by the direct action of protein kinase A (PKA) on 5-LO. The catalytic subunit of PKA directly phosphorylated 5-LO in vivo and in vitro and inhibited activity in intact cells and in vitro. Mutation of Ser-523 on human 5-LO prevented phosphorylation by PKA and restored LT synthesis. Treatment with PKA activators inhibited LTB4 synthesis in 3T3 cells expressing wild type 5-LO but not in cells expressing the S523A mutant of 5-LO. The mechanism of inhibition of LTB4 synthesis did not involve either reduced membrane association of activated 5-LO or redistribution of 5-LO from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Instead, PKA phosphorylation of recombinant 5-LO inhibited in vitro activity, as did co-transfection of cells with 5-LO plus the catalytic subunit of PKA. Also, substitution of Ser-523 with glutamic acid, mimicking phosphorylation, resulted in the total loss of 5-LO activity. These results indicate that PKA phosphorylates 5-LO on Ser-523, which inhibits the catalytic activity of 5-LO and reduces cellular LT generation. Thus, PKA activation, as can occur in response to adenosine, prostaglandin E2, β-adrenergic agonists, and other mediators, is a means of directly reducing 5-LO activity and LT synthesis that may be important in limiting inflammation and maintaining homeostasis.

Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). For example, LTB4 potently attracts and activates leukocytes and in this way plays an important role in the normal inflammatory response. Indeed, the underproduction of leukotrienes results in impaired host defense, manifested as susceptibility to infection (2Bailie M.B. Standiford T.J. Laichalk L.L. Coffey M.J. Strieter R. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5221-5224PubMed Google Scholar). However, the overproduction of LTB4 and cysteinyl LTs contributes to several diseases, most notably chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma (3Drazen J.M. Lilly C.M. Sperling R. Rubin P. Israel E. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1994; 22: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar), fibrosis (4Wilborn J. Bailie M. Coffey M. Burdick M. Strieter R. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin.

Thus, processes that affect the capacity of leukocytes to synthesize and secrete leukotrienes are of clinical importance. The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), in concert with the 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP), initiates LT synthesis from arachidonic acid (AA), catalyzing its hydroperoxidation and dehydration to produce LTA4. This intermediate can then be converted by LTA4 hydrolase to give LTB4 or by LTC4 synthase to produce LTC4. Also important in LT generation is the source of the substrate, AA. This fatty acid may be derived endogenously, released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipases (PLs), including the group IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) (7Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Alternatively, AA may be exogenously derived, released from membrane phospholipids of neighboring cells by various PLA2s. It was first demonstrated in 1970 that cAMP can inhibit the release of cysteinyl LTs, known then as slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (8Kooman W.J. Orange R.P. Austen K.F. J. Immunol. 1970; 105: 1096-1102PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP is formed from ATP by the action of adenylyl cyclase, an integral membrane protein that is activated by Gsα-protein-coupled receptors following ligand binding. Elevated cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) by binding to its two inhibitory subunits, causing the release and activation of the catalytic PKA subunits. Specific phosphodiesterases hydrolyze cAMP to AMP to limit signaling through this pathway. Since the seminal finding in 1970, subsequent studies have shown that LT synthesis is inhibited by ligands that activate Gsα-protein-coupled receptors (9Ham E.A. Soderman D.D. Zanetti M.E.

Although it is clear that PKA activation inhibits LT synthesis, our understanding of the mechanism remains incomplete. Activation of PKA can lead to phosphorylation of cPLA2 (19Meliton A.Y. Munoz N.M. Liu J. Lambertino A.T. Boetticher E. Myo S. Myou S. Zhu X. Johnson M. Leff A.R. J. Allergy Clin.

Alternatively, activation of PKA can be without effect (24Strokin M. Sergeeva M. Reiser G. Br. J.

Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 71-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) the release of AA in other circumstances, perhaps because AA may be released by PLA2s other than cPLA2. There are, to our knowledge, no reports of PKA inhibition of either the 12-LO or the 15-LO pathways, suggesting that these pathways are able to obtain AA during PKA activation and that these LOs are not inhibited by PKA.

Taken together, these findings suggest that PKA may have strong effects at an early step in the synthesis of LTs from AA. In this study, we asked whether PKA could directly phosphorylate 5-LO and whether phosphorylation affected the enzymatic activity of 5-LO. Sequence and Structural Analysis—Amino acid sequences were obtained from the Swiss Protein Database from the ExPaSy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Primary accession numbers for proteins are: 5-LOs, human P09917, mouse P48999, rat P12527, hamster P51399; 15-LOs, rabbit P12630 and human P16050; human platelet-type 12-LO P18054. Alignment of protein sequences was performed using ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar). Structural analysis utilized the resolved structure of rabbit 15-LO (Protein Data Bank accession number 11ox) and a published theoretical model of the 5-LO catalytic domain (27Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 75-83Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Prosite analysis of 5-LO was performed at ExPaSy (us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/scanprosite). Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and DNA Construction—Plasmids containing the wild type (WT) 5-LO or the S271A mutant of 5-LO, alone in pcDNA or fused to GFP in pEGFP, have been described previously (28Healy A.M.

Substitution of Ser-522 or Ser-523 with Ala or Ser-523 with Glu on these plasmids was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's directions. To generate GST fusion constructs, WT and mutant 5-LO cDNA sequences were amplified from the respective GFP·5-LO plasmids by high fidelity PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplified cDNA fragments were purified and ligated into the PGEX-4T3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the carboxyl terminus of the GST coding sequence. Mutations and protein frame reading were verified by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). Plasmid and oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. The plasmid encoding the mouse PKA catalytic subunit α (plasmid, pCMVCα; protein, Cα) was a gift of Dr. Michael D. Uhler (Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Michigan). Protein Purification and in Vitro PKA Phosphorylation Assay—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained by Coomassie Blue to verify the integrity and relative concentrations of expressed proteins. To test 5-LO phosphorylation in vitro by PKA, respective GST·5-LO fusion proteins (3 μg) were suspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 10 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (P2645, Sigma) with the final volume of 30 μl/reaction. As a positive control, a similar amount of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) produced in an E. coli expression system as a maltose-binding protein fusion protein (molecular mass = 81 kDa, purchased from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was used to compare the relative efficiency of in vitro PKA phosphorylation. To test the specificity of PKA phosphorylation, 5 μm PKA inhibitor peptide (P0300, Sigma) was added in the reaction mixture to test the specificity of PKA phosphorylation. Phosphorylation reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 40 min and terminated by the addition of 6 μlof6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. 32P-labeled fusion proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and detected by autoradiography. Cell Culture, Transfection, Cellular LTB4 Analysis, and Immunoblotting—NIH 3T3 cells obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% calf serum and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. To evaluate the effect of PKA phosphorylation of 5-LO on cellular LTB4 synthesis, 1.6 × 106 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of p5-LO or p5-LOS523A and increasing amounts of pCMVCα using Polyfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's directions. To measure the effect of PKA inhibitor or activators on cellular LTB4 synthesis, 3T3 cells were transfected with pGFP·5-LO or pGFP·5-LOS523A and, 16 h after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm H-89 (Calbiochem) for 2 h; 50 μm forskolin (Calbiochem) plus 45 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, Calbiochem) for 15 min; or 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP (Sigma) for 15 min. To stimulate LTB4 production, cells were incubated with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187, and 10 μm AA at 37 °C for 15 min. Immunoreactive LTB4 in conditioned media was quantitated by ELISA (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) following the supplier's instructions. The detection limit for LTB4 was 4 pg/ml; cross-reactivity for AA, 5-HETE, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 was <0.01%. Following stimulation, cells were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled, and 20 μl of total cell protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift of Dr. J. Evans, Merck Research Laboratories; titer 1:3000) (31Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J.A. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; titer 1:500) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Cα was detected using a monoclonal antibody against the human α catalytic subunit of PKA (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:1000). Phosphorylated 5-LO was detected using a polyclonal antibody against RKSS* developed by PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO). Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software. LTB4 synthesis by transfected cells was normalized for 5-LO protein expression. Kinase Assay for PKA—3T3 cells transfected with p5-LO or p5-LO/S523A and different amounts of pCα plasmid were sonicated in extraction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). PKA activity was determined by measuring the transfer of 32P-labeled phosphates to a phosphocellulose filter-bound peptide substrate using the SignaTECT PKA assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 6.5 μg of protein lysate with 100 μm biotinylated Kemptide (LRRASLG) to 25 μl of reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μlof7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride. A 10-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was spotted to a phosphocellulose filter and washed, and PKA activity was measured using an LS 6000TA liquid scintillation counter. Analysis of Eicosanoid Profile of 5-LO Metabolism—To evaluate the effect of PKA activity on the formation of different 5-LO products, 3T3 cells (1.6 × 106 cells) were co-transfected with 2 μg of p5-LO or p5-LOS523A, 2 μg of plasmid encoding FLAP (a generous gift of Dr. Timothy D. Bigby, Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA), and 2 μg of pCMVCα or its parent vector pCMVneo. Cells were harvested 16 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.6 mm CaCl2, 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187, and 10 μm AA (Cayman Chemicals) plus ∼30,000 dpm [3H]AA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 15 min. Conditioned media were extracted using C18 Sep-Pak Cartridges (Waters Corp., Milford, MA), and radiolabeled eicosanoids were separated by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (32Coffey M. Phare S. Kazanjian P. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 393-399PubMed Google Scholar). The 5-LO products LTB4 and 5-HETE were identified by co-elution with authentic standards (Biomol) and quantitated using an on-line radioactivity detector. Radiolabeled products were expressed as a percentage of total recovered radioactivity. LTB4 and 5-HETE synthesis in the presence of Cα (versus CMV-neo) were expressed as percentage of control. Ca2+-dependent Membrane Translocation—To assess the effect of PKA phosphorylation on 5-LO membrane translocation in cell-free conditions, 2 μgofGFP·5-LO or S523A constructs were co-transfected with 6 μg of pCMVCα or pCMVneo into 3T3 cells and, 20 h after transfection, cells were homogenized and analyzed as described (33Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modification. Briefly, cells were sonicated on ice three times, 20 s each in KPB-1 buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1)), and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then divided equally into two parts, one to which CaCl2 was added (4 mm final concentration), and the other to which vehicle (water) was added. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was designated the soluble fraction, and the pellet, washed and resuspended in KPB-1 buffer, was designated the pelletable microsomal fraction. To assess 5-LO membrane translocation in intact cells, transfected cells were stimulated with vehicle (Me2SO) or 10 μm A23187 in media for 20 min at 37 °C. After stimulation, cells were washed twice and sonicated in KPB-1 buffer, and soluble and pelletable microsomal fractions were prepared as described above. Protein concentrations of fractions were determined by a modified Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce), and 10 μg of protein/sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and evaluated by immunoblot as described above, with detection by GFP antibody. Cell-free 5-LO Enzymatic Activity Assay—Recombinant human 5-LO (2 μg; gift from Merck Frosst, Montreal, Canada) was treated with PKA catalytic subunit with or without PKA inhibitor peptide, as described above, for in vitro phosphorylation. Alternatively, 3T3 cells (1.6 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were co-transfected with 2 μg of p5-LO or p5-LOS523A and 2 μg of pCMVCα or pCMVneo. Cells were harvested 16 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated for 90 s in 10-s bursts on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris. The 5-LO activity of recombinant 5-LO or cell lysates (200 μg of total protein) was determined in 0.25-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 12 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 20 μm AA (Cayman Chemicals), including ∼100,000 dpm [3H]AA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 10 μm 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9-cis-11-trans-octadecadienoic acid (Cayman Chemicals). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ether/methanol/1 m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v/v) and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm, 5 min, and the upper phase was collected, evaporated under nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Lipid residues were dissolved in 250 μl of 50% acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (1000:1, v/v) and 50% water/trifluoroacetic acid (1000:1, v/v) and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (34Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Coffey M.J. Ojo T.C. Phare S.M. Peters-Golden M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2522-2527PubMed Google Scholar). There were no LTB4/LTB4 isomers detected in the cell lysates; 5-HPETE and 5-HETE coeluted as a single peak, clearly separated from unmetabolized AA. 5-LO specific activity was first calculated as percentage of conversion of radiolabeled AA to 5-HPETE/5-HETE and standardized for 5-LO expression. Final results were expressed as percentage of control. To study 5-LO enzyme kinetics with or without phosphorylation, 4 μg of p5-LO and 4 μg of pCMVCα or pCMVneo were co-transfected into 3.2 × 106 3T3 cells. Cells were harvested 16 h after transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated for 90 s in 10-s bursts on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris. The 5-LO activity of cell lysate in different cold AA concentrations (1, 3, 10, 30, 60, 100, 300, 1000 μm) was determined as described above and was first calculated as percentage of conversion of radiolabeled AA to 5-HPETE/5-HETE and standardized for 5-LO protein expression. Total products formed were expressed as pmol/min/5-LO densitometric unit. Vmax, Km, and V/Km were determined using GraphPad Prism software (Version 3.02, Graph-Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). To compare the intrinsic enzymatic activity of 5-LO and its mutant proteins S523A and S523E in vitro, 4 μg of plasmids expressing 5-LO, 5-LOS523A, and S523E was transfected into cells and, 16 h after transfection, the cell-free activity in each lysate was determined as described above. Microscopic Imaging of Living Cells—3T3 cells on chamber slides were transfected with GFP·5-LO and mounted on a temperature-regulated (37 °C) stage on a Leica DMIRB fluorescent inverted microscope. After pretreatment with forskolin or vehicle (Me2SO) for 20 min, cells were stimulated with 10 μm A23187 in calcium-containing medium. Fluorescent images were taken before and after 15 min of stimulation. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was evaluated by oneway analysis of variance, using p < 0.05 as indicative of statistical significance. Pairs of group means were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer after test. Phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser-523 by PKA—The human 5-LO protein sequence was scanned for consensus patterns using Prosite (35Sigrist C.J. Cerutti L. Hulo N. Gattiker A. Falquet L. Pagni M. Bairoch A. Bucher P. Brief Bioinform. 2002; 3: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), which revealed two sites on 5-LO that matched the pattern of [RK](2)-X-[ST] for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites. One site is RRcT, located at amino acids 246–249 (human 5-LO residues and numbering). Alignment of primary sequences of different LOs indicated that the critical 249 Ser/Thr site was not conserved across 5-LOs from different species, being replaced with Arg in hamster (Fig. 1A). Also, the pattern RRST was found on human 12-LO, indicating that this site is not unique to 5-LO. A second phosphorylation site was located at amino acids 520–523. Sequence alignment showed that the [RK](2)-X-[ST] pattern was common to all 5-LO species and unique to 5-LO (Fig. 1B). No sites matching the [RK](2)-X-[ST] pattern were found on FLAP. For these reasons, experiments were focused on the 520–523 residues of 5-LO. To evaluate whether 5-LO is a direct target for PKA phosphorylation in vitro, we performed an in vitro PKA kinase assay using purified GST·5-LO fusion protein as target. Autoradiography of reaction products showed that the 104-kDa fusion protein was phosphorylated by PKA and phosphorylation was inhibited by a PKA inhibitor peptide (Fig. 2A, PKI). Since GST is not phosphorylated by PKA (e.g. Ref. 36Evans G.J. Wilkinson M.C. Graham M.E. Turner K.M. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47877-47885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), this suggested that 5-LO was the target of PKA. Phosphorylation of 5-LO by PKA was comparable with that of CREB, a known PKA substrate; Coomassie staining of gels demonstrated comparable loading of purified proteins (Fig. 2B). Substitution of Ser-523 with Ala on GST·5-LO strongly reduced phosphorylation as compared with WT GST·5-LO (Fig. 2B). Slight residual phosphorylation suggested that an additional residue could be targeted by PKA under these optimal conditions. Mutation of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase site Ser-271 did not reduce phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that 5-LO is phosphorylated, like CREB, by PKA in vitro, and Ser-523 is the major site for phosphorylation by PKA. Inhibition of LTB4 Synthesis by Cα, Role of Ser-523—Previous studies indicated that 3T3 cells lacked endogenous 5-LO and did not secrete detectable LTB4 when stimulated with the calcium ionophore A23187 (data not shown). When cells were transiently transfected with 5-LO and stimulated with 10 μm ionophore without added AA, they synthesized 161.0 + 13.5 pg/ml LTB4. When a matched set of transfected cells, expressing a comparable amount of 5-LO, was stimulated with io"
https://openalex.org/W1972213770,"Curcumin, the yellow colored component of the spice turmeric, has been reported to rescue defective ΔF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cellular processing in homozygous mutant mice, restoring nasal potential differences and improving survival (Egan, M. E., Pearson, M., Weiner, S. A., Rajendran, V., Rubin, D., Glockner-Pagel, J., Canny, S., Du, K., Lukacs, G. L., and Caplan, M. J. (2004) Science 304, 600–602). Because of the implied potential use of curcumin or similar compounds in the therapy of cystic fibrosis caused by the ΔF508 mutation, we tried to reproduce and extend the pre-clinical data of Egan et al. Fluorometric measurements of iodide influx in Fischer rat thyroid cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR showed no effect of curcumin (1–40 μm) when added for up to 24 h prior to assay in cells grown at 37 °C. Controls, including 27 °C rescue and 4 mm phenylbutyrate at 37 °C, were strongly positive. Also, curcumin did not increase short circuit current in primary cultures of a human airway epithelium homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR with a 27 °C rescue-positive control. Nasal potential differences in mice were measured in response to topical perfusion with serial solutions containing amiloride, low Cl–, and forskolin. Robust low Cl– and forskolin-induced hyperpolarization of 22 ± 3 mV was found in wild type mice, with 2.1 ± 0.4 mV hyperpolarization in ΔF508 homozygous mutant mice. No significant increase in Cl–/forskolin hyperpolarization was seen in any of the 22 ΔF508 mice studied using different curcumin preparations and administration regimens, including that used by Egan et al. Assay of serum curcumin by ethyl acetate extraction followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry indicated a maximum serum concentration of 60 nm, well below that of 5–15 μm, where cellular effects by sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibition are proposed to occur. Our results do not support further evaluation of curcumin for cystic fibrosis therapy. Curcumin, the yellow colored component of the spice turmeric, has been reported to rescue defective ΔF508-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cellular processing in homozygous mutant mice, restoring nasal potential differences and improving survival (Egan, M.

Controls, including 27 °C rescue and 4 mm phenylbutyrate at 37 °C, were strongly positive. Also, curcumin did not increase short circuit current in primary cultures of a human airway epithelium homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR with a 27 °C rescue-positive control. Nasal potential differences in mice were measured in response to topical perfusion with serial solutions containing amiloride, low Cl–, and forskolin. Robust low Cl– and forskolin-induced hyperpolarization of 22 ± 3 mV was found in wild type mice, with 2.1 ± 0.4 mV hyperpolarization in ΔF508 homozygous mutant mice. No significant increase in Cl–/forskolin hyperpolarization was seen in any of the 22 ΔF508 mice studied using different curcumin preparations and administration regimens, including that used by Egan et al. Assay of serum curcumin by ethyl acetate extraction followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry indicated a maximum serum concentration of 60 nm, well below that of 5–15 μm, where cellular effects by sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibition are proposed to occur. Our results do not support further evaluation of curcumin for cystic fibrosis therapy. Cystic fibrosis (CF) 1The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; CFTR, CF transmembrane conductance regulator; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; FRT, Fischer rat thyroid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PD, potential difference; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein. is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-stimulated apical membrane chloride channel in epithelia in the airways, pancreas, intestine, and other tissues (1Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 2Sheppard D.N. Welsh M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S23-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The most common CFTR mutation, deletion of phenylalanine at the 508 position in its amino acid sequence (ΔF508), is present in at least one allele in ∼90% of CF subjects worldwide (3Bobadilla J.L. Macek M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Clinically, CF subjects manifest chronic lung infections, resulting in deterioration of lung function, and pancreatic insufficiency, resulting in intestinal malabsorption. The ΔF508-CFTR protein appears to be mildly misfolded and retained at the endoplasmic reticulum in cells where it is expressed (4Riordan J.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1499-1504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ΔF508-CFTR protein can be rescued by incubation of cell cultures for 18 h or more at reduced (<30 °C) temperature (6Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar) or with high concentrations of 4-phenylbutyrate (7Rubenstein R.C. Egan M.E. Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), resulting in partial restoration of ΔF508-CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane. However, the gating of the plasma membrane-rescued ΔF508-CFTR protein remains defective, such that its open probability after cAMP stimulation is reduced by >3-fold compared with that of wild type CFTR (8Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 9Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I.B.

Various small molecules have been identified that act as correctors of defective ΔF508-CFTR chloride channel gating (9Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I.B. Krouse M.E. Wakelee H. Law T. Xia Y. Nguyen H. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1544-C1555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Al-Nakkash L. Hu S. Li M. Hwang T.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 464-472PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yang H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Small molecule strategies to correct defective ΔF508-CFTR folding and plasma membrane targeting are under development, although approval of potentially efficacious compounds for clinical use is many years away. Recently, curcumin, the yellow colored component of the spice turmeric, has been reported to correct defective ΔF508-CFTR processing and function in cell and mouse models (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The stated rationale for the use of curcumin was its action as a weak inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium (SERCA) pump at 5–15 μm concentration, which was based on a prior study from the same group reporting that the potent SERCA pump inhibitor thapsigargin restored ΔF508-CFTR function (13Egan M.E. Glockner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nat. Med. 2003; 8: 485-492Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In ΔF508-CFTR homozygous mutant mice, Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) reported that oral curcumin (45 mg/kg/day in three doses for three days) corrected nasal potential differences (PDs) to the same level found in wild type mice and improved the survival of ΔF508-CFTR mice. Additionally, inclusion of 5 μm curcumin for 18 h in the cell culture medium in ΔF508-CFTR-transfected BHK cells resulted in a small increase in plasma membrane ΔF508-CFTR protein expression and cell chloride permeability. Curcumin preparations are widely available as nutritional supplements and have been cited to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects (14Rao C.V. Rivenson A. Simi B. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar, 15Busquets S. Carbo N. Almendro V. Quiles M.T. Lopez-Soriano F.J. Argiles J.M.

However, studies in humans have indicated very low bioavailability and rapid hepatic metabolism of orally administered curcumin (18Sharma R.A. McLelland H.R. Hill K.A. Ireson C.R. Euden S.A.

Cancer. 2004; 90: 1011-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), with only low nanomolar levels detectable in the blood after high dose administration. The purpose of this study was to confirm and extend the results of Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), motivated by our interest in identifying clinically useful small molecule correctors of ΔF508-CFTR gating and cellular misprocessing (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

Contrary to the report by Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we were unable to demonstrate correction of nasal PDs in ΔF508-CFTR homozygous mutant mice despite using different curcumin preparations and administration protocols, nor were we able to demonstrate functional correction in ΔF508-CFTR-transfected epithelial cells or ΔF508-CFTR homozygous human airway cells. Furthermore, we could detect very little curcumin in blood specimens from mice after oral bolus administration. The inability of curcumin to give a reproducible, robust response in mouse and cell models, together with the lack of a validated mechanism of action and pharmacological profile, do not support its development as a therapy for CF caused by the ΔF508 mutation. Mice—Wild type and CF mice (targeted ΔF508 gene replacement per Ref. 22Colledge W.H. Abella B.S. Southern K.W. Ratcliff R. Jiang C. Cheng S.H. MacVinish L.J. Anderson J.R. Cuthbert A.W Evans M.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) were used for nasal PD studies. The CF mice were back-crossed into a CD1 genetic background (>8 generations) and bred at the University of California, San Francisco animal facility. CF mice were genotyped in accordance with standard procedures using the primers 5′-GCCTAGAAAATGTCCCTGTATCATG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTTCAAGGTGAGTAGTCAAG-3′ (Invitrogen) and SsPI restriction digestion to cut the targeted Cftr allele. Wild type mice were fed standard mouse chow, and the CF mice were maintained on a liquid diet (Peptamen). CF mice were studied at age 12–16 weeks, with weights ranging from 20 to 25 g. Animal protocols were approved by the University of California, San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Curcumin Preparations and Administration Protocols—Various preparations and administration methods were used. Most studies were done using curcumin from Sigma (catalog number C1386, lot number 053k3522), with a limited set of studies done with a purified curcumin preparation (Fluka, catalog number 28260) and a neutraceutical curcumin preparation (Curcumin 95™, Jarrow Formulas, Los Angeles, CA). Three different vehicles were used for the oral administration of curcumin to mice as follows. 1) Curcumin was dissolved in Me2SO, and then ethanol was added and mixed with PBS (for 1 mg per 100 μl of curcumin solution containing 5.4 μlofMe2SO, 44.6 μl of ethanol, and 50 μl of PBS, pH 7.2). During brief anesthesia with halothane, a 25-gauge feeding needle (or PE-90 tubing) was used to infuse 45 mg/kg curcumin into the mouse stomach daily for 3 days, with the final dose delivered 2 h before the measurement of nasal PDs. 2) According to the method reported in Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), curcumin powder was mixed with Alimentum (50 mg/ml) and sonicated for 30 s just before oral delivery by presenting the liquid at the tip of an Eppendorf pipette to non-anesthetized mice. The presented liquid was rapidly ingested by most mice. Curcumin was given at 0, 45, or 100 mg/kg three times a day for 3 days, with the final dose delivered 2 h before the measurement of nasal PDs. 3) The third method was the same as the second one, except that Peptamen was used instead of Alimentum as the delivery vehicle. Nasal Potential Difference Measurements—Following anesthesia with intraperitoneal ketamine (90–120 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg), the airway was protected by orotracheal intubation with a 21-gauge angiocatheter as described (23Salinas D.B. Pedemonte N. Muanprasat C. Finkbeiner W.F. Nielson D.W. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). A PE-10 cannula pulled to a tip diameter of 0.3 mm was inserted into one nostril 5 mm distal to the anterior nares and connected through a 1 m KCl agar bridge to a silver/silver chloride electrode and high impedance digital voltmeter (IsoMillivolt Meter, World Precision Instruments). The nasal cannula was perfused at 50 μl/min using dual microperfusion pumps serially with PBS, PBS containing amiloride (100 μm), low chloride PBS (chloride reduced to 4.7 mm by substitution with gluconate), low chloride PBS containing forskolin (20 μm), and then PBS. The reference electrode was a PBS-filled 21-gauge needle inserted in the subcutaneous tissue in the abdomen and connected to a second silver/silver chloride electrode by a 1 m KCl agar bridge. Functional Measurements in ΔF508-CFTR-transfected Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) Cells—FRT cells stably expressing human ΔF508-CFTR and YFP-H148Q-I152L were cultured on 96-well black wall plates as described previously (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumin (1–40 μm) diluted in the culture medium from a concentrated stock in Me2SO. Negative controls included cells treated with equivalent concentrations of Me2SO alone. In some studies curcumin was delivered in Alimentum as was done in nasal PD experiments. Two positive controls were used as follows: 1) incubation of cells for 24 h at 37 °C with culture medium containing 4 mm 4-phenylbutyrate (7Rubenstein R.C. Egan M.E. Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2457-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and 2) incubation of cells for 24 h at 27 °C (“low temperature rescue”). After treatment, cells were washed three times with a phosphate-buffered solution and then stimulated with forskolin (20 μm) and genistein (50 μm) to maximally activate halide conductance in the ΔF508-CFTR protein that reached the plasma membrane (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Iodide influx measurements were done on a fluorescence plate reader (Optima, BMG Lab Technologies) equipped with two syringe pumps and HQ500/20X (500 ± 10 nm) excitation and HQ535/30 M (535 ± 15 nm) emission filters (Chroma). YFP fluorescence was recorded for 2 s prior to and 12 s after creation of the iodide gradient. Initial rates of iodide influx were computed from the time course of decreasing fluorescence after the iodide gradient (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Short Circuit Current Measurements on Human Airway Epithelial Cells—Human airway epithelial cells from a CF subject homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation were cultured on Snapwell filters with 1-cm2 surface area (Corning-Costar) to resistances >1,000 ohms·cm2 as described previously (24Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Filters were mounted in an Easymount Chamber System (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego). Both hemichambers contained Krebs solution (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 3.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm K2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3). Solutions were bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Short circuit current was recorded using a DVC-1000 voltage-clamp (World Precision Instruments) with silver/silver chloride electrodes and 1 m KCl agar bridges. Oral Bioavailability of Curcumin in Mice—Blood samples were obtained at 2 h after the oral administration of curcumin (0, 45, or 100 mg/kg), and plasma was collected (after heparinization) by centrifugation at 4300 × g for 10 min. Plasma (∼0.5 ml) was acidified to pH 3 using 6 n HCl and extracted twice (1 ml each) using a mixture of ethyl acetate and isopropanol (9:1; v/v) by shaking for 6 min (25Pan M.H. Huang T.M. Lin J.K. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 486-494PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments to determine detection sensitivity, known quantities of curcumin (from Me2SO, final concentration10–1000 nm) were added to serum samples from mice that did not receive curcumin. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min, and the upper ethyl acetate layer was used for the determination of curcumin by liquid chromatography/mass spectometry. The organic layer was dried under flowing argon, and the residue was dissolved in an eluent containing 1% acetic acid and filtered to remove insoluble material. To the resultant filtrate was added a known quantity of rhodamine 101 as an internal standard for ratiometric quantitative analysis. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out using a Supelco C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm; 5-μm particle size) connected to a Waters solvent delivery system, UV/visible detector, and a mass spectrometer. The mobile phase consisted of 40% tetrahydrofuran and 60% water (v/v) containing 1% citric acid adjusted to pH 3 (KOH) (25Pan M.H. Huang T.M. Lin J.K. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1999; 27: 486-494PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cooper T.H. Clark G. Guzinski J. Ho C.T. Food Phytochemicals II: Tea, Spices, and Herbs. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1994: 231-236Google Scholar), and system was run isocratically. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min, and the injection volume was 20 μl. In most experiments the solvent system consisted of a 20-min linear gradient of acetonitrile/water (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) with acetonitrile increasing from 10 to 95%. Calibration curves over the range of 50 nm to 20 μm were established using rhodamine 101 as an internal standard. Curcumin was detected at 424 nm, and its peak was confirmed by a molecular ion peak in mass chromatogram (m/z) at 369 daltons (M+1)+ using the positive electrospray mode. Mass spectra were acquired using positive ion detection, scanning from 200 to 600 Da. The electrospray ion source parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 3.5 volts (positive ion mode); cone voltage, 37 volts; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 250 °C; cone gas flow, 62 liters/h, and desolvation gas flow, 362 liters/h. The limit of detection for serum curcumin in this assay was <20 nm. Cell Culture Models of ΔF508-CFTR Rescue—A series of experiments was done using FRT epithelial cells that stably coexpressed ΔF508-CFTR with a green fluorescent protein-based fluorescence halide indicator. These cells were selected from many clones to give a robust low temperature rescue in which incubation at 27 °C for 18–24 h results in ΔF508-CFTR targeting the plasma membrane and restoration of halide transport function (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows representative fluorescence data. Basal iodide influx in cells grown at 37 °C in the absence of a corrector of defective ΔF508-CFTR cellular processing was 0.094 ± 0.006 mm/s in this assay. In positive control studies, the influx rate increased to 0.28 ± 0.01 mm/s for cells grown at 27 °C for 24 h and 0.18 ± 0.01 mm/s for cells grown at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of 4 mm phenylbutyrate (Fig. 1B). The increased iodide influx in both positive controls was inhibited by the thiazolidinone CFTR blocker CFTRinh-172 (not shown). In dose-response measurements involving the 24-h incubation of cells with different concentrations of curcumin (1–40 μm, from Me2SO stock), there was no significant increase in iodide influx over the Me2SO (vehicle-alone) control (Fig. 1B). Also, no significant increase in iodide influx was found for the pure and neutraceutical curcumin preparations (1–40 μm; 40 μm data is shown in Fig. 1B). No increase in iodide influx was seen for different times of incubation (0–24 h) with 40 μm curcumin (Fig. 1C). Also, the possibility that curcumin could function as a potentiator of defective ΔF508-CFTR gating was investigated. In low temperature-rescued cells, curcumin (40 μm) did not increase the rate of iodide influx above that induced by forskolin (not shown). Also, a 24-h growth of cells at 27 °Cin the presence of curcumin did not increase iodide influx above that seen in the absence of curcumin (not shown). Experiments were also carried out in primary cultures of airway epithelial cells homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation, which we showed previously to have a low temperature rescue response (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Short circuit current data shown in Fig. 2A indicate a substantial increase in current in response to forskolin/genistein after a 24-h growth of cells at 27 °C. Also, a reduction in the amiloride response was often seen. Averaged data are summarized in Fig. 2B, including data showing no significant effect of incubation with 40 μm curcumin at 37 °C for 24 h prior to short circuit current measurements. Nasal Potential Difference Measurements in Mice—Fig. 3A shows the nasal PD protocol as used in wild type mice. After depolarization of nasal PD caused by amiloride, robust hyperpolarizations were seen after topical application of a low chloride solution and a low chloride solution containing forskolin. Fig. 3B summarizes nasal PDs for a series of curcumin-treated and untreated wild type mice (after correcting for a 1.4-mV junction potential). Curcumin at 45 mg/kg/day did not significantly affect nasal PDs in wild type mice. Initial curcumin studies in CF mice were done using the oral administration protocol of Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) at 45 mg/kg/day in Alimentum in three divided doses. Nasal PD measurements were performed at 2 h after the ninth curcumin dose. Representative nasal PD recordings using both Alimentum and Peptamen vehicles are shown in Fig. 4A. Although an amiloride-induced depolarization was seen, low chloride/forskolin hyperpolarization was absent in the CF mice. (The small depolarization after low chloride is a junction potential effect). Averaged results after correction for the junction potential are given in Fig. 4B. Fig. 4C summarizes the differences in nasal PDs (ΔPD, PBS/amiloride versus low chloride/forskolin) for all wild type and ΔF508 mutant mice. Although robust hyperpolarizations were seen in all curcumin-treated and control wild type mice, no effect of curcumin treatment was seen in any CF mouse, including mice treated with a dose equivalent to the maximum tolerated by humans (8 g/day, 100 mg/kg) (27Chainani-Wu N. J. Altern. Complement. Med. 2003; 9: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), given in three divided doses in Alimentum for 3 days. Data are also shown for mice given the pure and neutraceutical curcumin preparations (45 mg/kg/day in three doses in Alimentum; Fig. 4C, right-most lanes). Averaged ΔPD was 22 ± 3 mV in wild type mice (all study conditions averaged) and 2.1 ± 0.4 mV in ΔF508 mice. Oral Bioavailability of Curcumin in Mice—A liquid chromatograpy/mas spectrometry assay was developed to measure plasma curcumin concentration in mice. The assay involved use of rhodamine 101 as an internal HPLC standard for ratiometric analysis of curcumin concentration. Calibrations were done by adding known concentrations of curcumin and rhodamine 101 to plasma from mice not receiving curcumin. Curcumin was detected by absorbance at 424 nm with mass spectrometric verification of the corresponding molecular ion peak, and rhodamine 101 was detected by absorbance at 540 nm. Fig. 5A shows an HPLC chromatogram of the extract of a plasma control (top) and plasma in which 50 nm curcumin was added (middle). The curcumin was eluted at 10.80 min (in a 424-nm trace), and the corresponding mass peak was visible in m/z = 369 Da trace (bottom). The rhodamine 101 internal standard eluted at 8.57 min in the 540-nm trace (not shown). Initial analysis of serum at 2 h after oral administration of 15 mg/kg curcumin (sonicated in Alimentum) showed no detectable curcumin; however, curcumin was detected after a 100 mg/kg dose. Ratiometric quantitative analysis indicated plasma curcumin concentrations of 60 and 36 nm at 30 min and 2 h, respectively, indicating very low oral bioavailability of curcumin in mice (Fig. 5B, top). Fig. 5B also shows HPLC profile (middle) and m/z = 369 trace (bottom). The curcumin peak, as confirmed by its retention time and molecular ion peak, was very weak. These results agree with the low oral bioavailability of curcumin in humans reported by several groups (18Sharma R.A. McLelland H.R. Hill K.A. Ireson C.R. Euden S.A. Manson M.M. Pirmohamed M.

Curcumin was unable to produce functional correction of ΔF508-CFTR processing in epithelial cells in culture models and CF mice. Although a negative study cannot be definitive, the data raise significant doubt about the potential utility of curcumin and related compounds in the therapy of CF. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that under some conditions curcumin may correct ΔF508-CFTR processing, the data here show that such correction, if it can occur, is not robust or explicable on the basis of measured curcumin pharmacology or the proposed curcumin inhibition of the SERCA pump. We were unable to detect correction of nasal PDs in any ΔF508-CFTR homozygous mutant mouse receiving curcumin using a variety of different vehicles, curcumin concentrations, and administration protocols. Robust hyperpolarization in response to low chloride and forskolin-containing solutions was seen in all wild type mice. We reported previously that the forskolin-dependent hyperpolarization in wild type mice was blocked by the CFTR inhibitors CFTRinh-172 and GlyH-101 (24Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D.

The low chloride-induced hyperpolarization in the absence of cAMP agonists was not blocked by CFTR inhibitors, was partially inhibited by DIDS, and was absent in CF mice, suggesting CFTR-regulation of chloride transport by an as yet unidentified non-CFTR pathway. The nasal PD measurement method used here has several improvements over previous methods, including the use of orotracheal intubation and micropositional cannula placement (23Salinas D.B. Pedemonte N. Muanprasat C. Finkbeiner W.F. Nielson D.W. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), yielding reproducible PDs with excellent sensitivity for detection of activator/inhibitor effects. Our negative nasal PD data are at variance with the large correction in nasal PDs by curcumin reported by Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). We think it is unlikely that genetic factors could account for the difference in results, because no correction was found here in any mouse in an outbred CD1 strain having mouse-to-mouse genetic variations. The hybrid inbred strain of mice and the identical lot of curcumin used by Egan et al. were not available for our study. It was puzzling that Egan et al. found full correction in nasal PDs in CF mice to the same level seen in wild type mice, particularly because ΔF508 mutant mice express considerably less CFTR than wild type mice, and the apparent extent of correction was very small in their cell culture studies. Also, it is difficult to understand how full correction of nasal PDs could occur because curcumin did not correct defective ΔF508-CFTR gating in our studies, and thus only a minor response is predicted even if curcumin corrected the reduced ΔF508-CFTR expression level and the defective cellular processing. Egan et al. also reported improved survival in CF mice given oral curcumin. However, the improved survival cannot be ascribed to a curcumin effect because appropriate controls were not done, including survival studies on CFTR-null mice and a vehicle (Alimentum)-alone control. The improved survival of ΔF508 CF mice may be related to the pro-diarrheal effects of mouse handling or the administration of Alimentum and/or curcumin (31Araujo C.C. Leon L.L. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2001; 96: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), as other pro-diarrheal agents such as Colyte are known to improve the survival of CF mice (32Clarke L.L. Gawenis L.R. Franklin C.L. Harline M.C. Lab. Anim. Sci. 1996; 46: 612-618PubMed Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the high concentrations of curcumin in the mouse gut may reduce mucus accumulation and obstruction by effects unrelated to the correction of ΔF508-CFTR processing. We were unable to detect functional correction in ΔF508-CFTR-transfected FRT epithelial cells or primary cultures of human airway epithelium homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation. The transfected FRT cell model has been used for the identification of small molecule correctors of defective ΔF508-CFTR gating and cellular processing by high throughput screening (11Yang H. Shelat A.A. Guy R.K. Gopinath V.S. Ma T. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Taddei A. Folli C. Pedemonte N. Galietta L.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35079-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These cells manifest a robust low temperature rescue response as demonstrated by fluorescence, electrophysiological, and biochemical assays, as well as a large response to the small molecule correctors of ΔF508-CFTR processing identified by high throughput screening. Our YFP-based assay for ΔF508-CFTR activity is sensitive and accurate with a Z′-factor of >0.7. By statistical analysis we estimated the ability to detect with confidence a level of correction for curcumin equivalent to 10% that of low temperature. Curcumin was also without effect in human ΔF508-CFTR homozygous airway cells as assayed electrophysiologically with a positive low temperature rescue control. In contrast to our negative data, Egan et al. (12Egan M.E. Pearson M. Weiner S.A. Rajendran V. Rubin D. Glockner-Pagel J. Canny S. Du K. Lukacs G.L. Caplan M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) reported a small amount of ΔF508-CFTR correction (∼40% of the low temperature response) in ΔF508-CFTR-transfected BHK cells as assayed biochemically and by 36Cl– uptake. In summary, we were unable to document a significant effect of curcumin in the functional correction of defective ΔF508-CFTR processing in transfected cells, native airway cells, and mutant mice. The measured low oral bioavailability of curcumin suggests maximal serum concentrations many orders of magnitude lower than that proposed to produce SERCA pump inhibition. Our results do not support further evaluation of curcumin as a therapy of CF caused by the ΔF508 mutation."

Freshly isolated activated retinal microglia expressed high molecular weight forms of neurotrophins including that of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4. Conditioned media from cultured retinal microglia (MGCM) consistently yielded a ∼32-kDa NGF-reactive band when supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or protease inhibitors (PI); and promoted cell death that was suppressed by NGF immunodepletion in a mouse photoreceptor cell line (661w). The ∼32 kDa protein was partially purified (MGCM/p32) and was highly immunoreactive with a polyclonal anti-pro-NGF antibody. Both MGCM/p32 and recombinant pro-NGF protein promoted cell death in 661w cultures. Increased levels of pro-NGF mRNA and protein were observed in the RCS rat model of retinal dystrophy. MGCM-mediated cell death was reversed by p75NTR antiserum in p75NTR+/trkA– 661w cells.

The close spatial relationship between the displaced microglial cells and the degenerating photoreceptor cells suggests that microglial cells might be involved in photoreceptor cell death. Activated microglia secrete cytotoxic factors such as free oxygen intermediates, proteases, and excitatory amino acids that may induce neuronal degeneration (5Colton C.A. Gilbert D.L.

Support for the cytotoxicity of NGF, however, mostly came from indirect studies involving the use of inhibitors to protect from neurotrophin-induced cell death. Other studies demonstrated that NGF toxicity required preabsorption of NGF to glass beads (3Harada T. Harada C. Nakayama N. Okuyama S. Yoshida K. Kohsaka S. Matsuda H. Wada K. Neuron. 2000; 26: 533-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Frade J.M. Barde Y.-A.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1139-1148PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational changes to NGF or its receptors might be necessary for the induction of cell death. The toxicity of NGF might also be attributed to the presence of high molecular weight NGF proteins, pronerve growth factor (pro-NGF), in samples of commercial NGF preparations isolated from animal tissues. 2R. Roque, personal observations.2R. Roque, personal observations. Recent findings of pro-apoptotic activity of neurotrophin precursors, called proneurotrophins, further support the suggestion that NGF toxicity might be attributed to pro-NGF. Lee et al. (23Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) proposed that proneurotrophins, such as pronerve growth factor (pro-NGF), could be secreted and cleaved extracellularly by matrix metalloproteinases or plasmin to release mature neurotrophins that activate Trk receptors to promote cell survival or differentiation. But under conditions of decreased levels or activity of enzymes, secreted proneurotrophins could bind p75NTR with high affinity and induce p75NTR-dependent apoptosis. We have previously reported that retina-derived microglial cells secreted soluble products in their conditioned media that promoted apoptosis of photoreceptor cells in vitro (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With our findings of microglial activation and of increased expression of p75NTR in photoreceptor cells of RCS dystrophic rat retinas (2Roque R.S. Imperial C.J. Caldwell R.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 196-203PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheedlo H.J. Srinivasan B. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. Roque C.H. Lambert W. Wordinger R.J. Roque R.S. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 103: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and reports of toxicity of microglia-derived NGF-like proteins in programmed retinal cell death, we hypothesized that microglia-derived pro-NGF might be involved in the mechanisms of photoreceptor cell death in degenerative retinal diseases. The following study was done to investigate the secretion of NGF and pro-NGF by retina-derived microglial cells and to determine their toxicity on an established mouse photoreceptor cell line. Animals—RCS dystrophic rats and age-matched genetic control RCS-rdy+ (Rdy) rats maintained on a 12-hr light/dark cycle with reduced illumination (6–7 foot candles in cages) were sacrificed. 3This was performed in accordance with The ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research and Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication 85-23, revised 1996. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and the eyeballs were enucleated and used for isolation of primary cultures or collection of protein and RNA. Cell Cultures—Microglial cells were isolated from retinas of 6–8-week-old RCS dystrophic rats and maintained in culture as described (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Roque R.S. Caldwell R.B. Curr. Eye. Res. 1993; 12: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Growth medium was supplemented with 200 units of recombinant human macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhMCSF; Genetics Institute, Boston, MA) to maintain the “activated” phenotype of microglial cultures. The expression of microglial markers in the cultures were verified using Bandeiraea (Griffonia) simplicifolia isolectin B4 and antibodies against phosphotyrosine and vimentin prior to use as described (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Roque R.S. Caldwell R.B. Curr. Eye. Res. 1993; 12: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cellular morphology and phagocytosis of fluorescein-labeled beads were used to assess “microglial activation” (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Roque R.S. Caldwell R.B. Curr. Eye. Res. 1993; 12: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were used for collection of lysates or conditioned media (CM) within 2 passages from initial isolation. CM was collected from activated microglial cells (MGCM) incubated in serum-free basal medium (BM) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15 mm Hepes buffer for 48 h in the presence or absence of 0.01–0.05% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or protease inhibitors (PI). The PI used, including aprotinin 1 mg/ml, AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) 400 μg/ml, leupeptin hemisulfate 1 μg/ml, and pepstatin A 1 μg/ml, were obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA. The presence of BSA appeared to be necessary to stabilize the activity of the microglia-secreted factors, but it also hampered the purification of the secreted molecules. On the other hand, supplementation with PI was suitable for the purification of the microglia-derived toxic activity, but was not appropriate for biological assays because of direct toxicity of protease inhibitors on the target cultures. The 661w photoreceptor cell line was used to test the toxicity of the CM.661w cells were derived from transgenic mice retinas expressing SV40T-antigen (27Al-Ubaidi M.R. Font R.L. Quiambao A.B. Keener M.J. Loiu G.I. Overbeek P.A. Baehr W. J.

Rat PC12 cells (American Type Culture Collection), known to express neurotrophin receptors, were used as positive controls. Partial Purification of Pro-NGF—MGCM/PI was concentrated 20-fold using Centricon 3 and fractionated through a Sephadex 75 column using 20 mm PB. Conditioned media was applied to the column and eluted at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A total of 25 0.5-ml fractions was collected, pooled into 5 fractions, concentrated, and used for gel electrophoresis and immunoblots or tested for biological activity using MTS assay. The ∼32-kDa band in MGCM/PI (MGCM/p32) was partially purified from the active fractions using a mini whole gel eluter (Bio-Rad) according to product specifications. Briefly, fraction II was concentrated using Centricon 3, separated in 4–12% native gradient polyacrylamide minigel, and electroeluted into 14 fractions. Eluted fractions were separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and processed for immunoblot using anti-NGF or anti-pro-NGF, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against GST fusion protein containing amino acids 23–81 of human pro-NGF (30Beattie M.S.

Fractions containing partially purified MGCM/p32 were pooled and tested for activity on the cultured 661w cells. Immunodepletion and Neutralization Assays—To determine whether the microglia-derived toxicity was caused by an NGF-related molecule, 661w cells were incubated in NGF-immunodepleted MGCM/BSA. NGF was extracted using a modified immunoprecipitation procedure. Briefly, MGCM/BSA was precleared by incubating in recombinant protein G-agarose beads (rPrG-agarose; Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h then spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 ng of affinity-purified rabbit anti-NGF IgG (sc-548; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) preadsorbed to rPrG-agarose per 50-μg samples. The next day, the mixture was spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The immunodepleted MGCM/BSA was also processed for immunoblot using affinity-purified rat monoclonal anti-NGF IgG (clone 1G3; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) diluted 1:500. To neutralize p75NTR, a rabbit polyclonal antiserum made against the extracellular domain of the mouse p75NTR (9651; a gift from Dr. Moses Chao, New York University School of Medicine, New York) and shown to block NGF binding to p75NTR (31Huber L.J. Chao M.V. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was added to the cells at 1:100 dilution 24 h prior to MGCM/BSA treatment. Cell Survival Assays—The toxicity of MGCM/BSA and the neutralization studies were tested on 661w cells using the MTS assay (Cell Titer 96; Promega Corp.) as described previously (10Rosales A.A. Roque R.S. Brain Res. 1997; 748: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, 661w cells plated at 10,000 cells/well on 96-well plates were incubated in basal medium for 24 h prior to treatment. Following treatment, cells were incubated in 333 μg/ml of MTS and 25 μm phenazine methosulfate for 1 h, and absorbance readings at 490 nm were converted to cell counts based on standard curves generated from 661w cells 4 h from plating. All experiments were done in triplicates. Statistical analyses were done using one-way ANOVA. Survival assays were also performed on 661w cells using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Calcein Am is a non-fluorescent cell-permeable dye that is converted to fluorescent calcein by intracellular esterases present in live cells. Ethidium homodimer is a fluorescent non-cell permeable dye normally excluded by live cells but can enter dead cells and bind to nucleic acids. The 661w cells plated on 24-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells/well were incubated under various conditions for 48 h followed by a mixture of 2 μm calcein-AM and 4 μm ethidium homodimer for 45 min and viewed under Olympus inverted microscope with an epifluorescence attachment (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Reverse Transcription-PCR and Southern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells or mouse retinas for cDNA synthesis and PCR as described (32Jingjing L. Xue Y. Agarwal N. Roque R.S.

X05137: 5′-GGAGCCAACCAGACCGTGTG-3′, position 288–307 and 5′-CGCCTTGTTTATTTTGTTTGC′, position 949–969) and trkA (GenBank™ accession no. M85214: 5′-TCTCCTTCCCAGCCAGTGTG-3′, position 912–931 and 5′-AGGGTTGTCCATAAAAGCAG-3′, position 1197–1216). Amplification of 18 S rRNA was used as an internal control. PCR products were run on agarose gels and processed for Southern blot analyses using 32P-labeled probes: 5′-GTGGGCTCGGGACTCGTGTTC-3′ for p75NTR or 5′-CCGCCAGCAGGGTGTAGTTC-3′ for trkA. Neurotrophin mRNA expression was also determined using RT-PCR. PCR primers were designed to amplify rat NGF (GenBank™ accession no.

Roque R.S. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Relative RT-PCR and Southern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from six 8-week-old RCS and Rdy rat retinas for cDNA synthesis and used for relative PCR as described (32Jingjing L. Xue Y. Agarwal N. Roque R.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 752-759PubMed Google Scholar). PCR primers were designed to amplify rat NGF (GenBank™ accession no. M36589): (5′-CTCTGTCCCTGAAGCCCACTG-3′, position 379–399 and 5′-GCCTGTTTGTCGTCTGTTGTC-3′, position 922–942) or rat p75NTR (GenBank™ accession no. X05137): (5′-AGCCAACCAGACCGTGTGTG-3′, position 290–309 and 5′-TTGCAGCTGTTCCACCTCTT-3′, position 933–952); while 18 S competimers (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) were used to amplify 18 S as internal control. PCR products for NGF and p75NTR were processed for Southern blot analysis using 32P-labeled NGF oligonucleotide probes for NGF (5′-ACCTCCTTGCCCTTGATGTCC-3′) and p75NTR (5′-GTGGGCTCGGGACTCGTGTTC-3′). Experiments were done at least three times. Immunoblotting—Tissues and cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates and concentrated CM were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of 25-μg samples were fractionated in 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels together with molecular MASS standards (14.4–97.4 kDa; Bio-RAD) and processed for immunoblotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NGF (sc-548), BDNF (sc-546), NT3 (sc-547), NT4 (sc-545), and β-tubulin (sc-9104) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1 μg/ml while rabbit anti-pro-NGF IgG (30Beattie M.S.

Blots were reacted with appropriate horseradish peroxidaseonjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using Supersignal West Pico (Pierce). Murine NGFβ was obtained from different commercial sources including Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel (N-130), Invitrogen (13257-019), and Promega Corp. (G514B). Neurotrophin Expression in Primary Cultures of Microglial Cells—To establish the expression of neurotrophins in activated retinal microglia, microglial cells were isolated from RCS dystrophic rat retinas and grown in the presence of rhMCSF to maintain their activated phenotype. Several attempts to isolate similar cultures from age-matched congenic control rats (Rdy) were mostly unsuccessful and often resulted in few flattened cells that did not proliferate and rapidly senesced. Freshly isolated or first passaged microglial cultures were found to stain intensely for B. (Griffonia) simplicifolia isolectin B4, phosphotyrosine, and vimentin (data not shown) as previously observed (26Roque R.S. Caldwell R.B. Curr. Eye. Res. 1993; 12: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cultures were used for isolation of RNA for RT-PCR or for collection of CM in the presence of protease inhibitors (MGCM/PI) to be used for Western blots. Microglial cells expressed PCR products whose sizes 249, 198, 145, and 747 bp were compatible with expected products for rat NGF, NT4, NT3, and BDNF, respectively (Fig. 1A). Specificity of PCR products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression of NGF, NT4, NT3, and BDNF was further investigated using Western blots and showed the presence of ∼32, ∼55, ∼58, and ∼36 kDa immunoreactive bands, respectively, in the MGCM/PI (Fig. 1B). The slow migrating neurotrophin bands were much larger than their reported sizes of ∼13–14 kDa, and could represent multimeric forms of neurotrophins, neurotrophins bound to soluble truncated receptors (34Zupan A.A. Osborne P.A. Smith C.E. Siegel N.R. Leimgruber R.M. Johnson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11714-11720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or secreted neurotrophin precursors (proneurotrophins) that have not undergone maturation (23Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ∼13–14 kDa neurotrophin monomers were never observed in the retinal microglia CM unlike that in the CM of Müller cells (35Taylor S. Srinivasan B. Wordinger R.J. Roque R.S. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 111: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the predominant retinal glia. Microglial Cells Secreted High Molecular Weight Forms of NGF—To begin to investigate the high molecular weight NGF-reactive band secreted by activated retinal microglia, CM were collected from the microglial cultures in the presence or absence of bovine serum albumin (MGCM/BSA) or protease inhibitors (MGCM/PI). The ∼32-kDa NGF band was observed in both MGCM/BSA or MGCM/PI but not in MGCM alone. No NGF-reactive bands were observed in any of the CM at the expected size of the mature NGF at ∼13 kDa, shown by the commercially obtained NGFβ protein (Fig. 2A). These findings suggested that the amounts of ∼32 kDa protein and of mature NGF in the unsupplemented CM were either quite low or that they were easily degraded by proteases in the CM. These findings also suggested that BSA and protease inhibitors were able to protect the ∼32 kDa band from proteolytic degradation similar to that reported in the case of proneurotrophins (23Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The toxicity of microglia-derived products was tested on 661w photoreceptor cells and showed a ∼64% decrease in cell counts in cultures treated with MGCM/BSA compared with defined medium alone (BM) (Fig. 2C). MGCM alone or commercial NGFβ from various sources also did not exhibit toxicity (p > 0.1). To further determine the activity of the microglia-derived NGF-reactive bands MGCM/BSA was immunodepleted using anti-NGF IgG. Immunoblots showed ∼32-kDa NGF bands in MGCM/BSA and in the immunoprecipitate (pellet), but not in the supernatant (Fig. 2B) consistent with immunodepletion of NGF from the CM. In the presence of MGCM/BSA, the number of surviving cells was reduced to ∼42% of that in basal medium (BM) (Fig. 2D). Following treatment with NGF-depleted supernatant (MGCM/BSA-NGF), cell numbers were similar (p > 0.1) to those in BM, suggesting that removal of ∼32 kDa NGF protein abolished the toxicity of MGCM/BSA. The number of surviving cells following treatment with NGF-containing beads also resembled that in MGCM/BSA-treated cultures (data not shown). The presence of cytotoxicity only in microglial CM that contained the ∼32 kDa protein, and the inhibition of toxicity following its extraction, suggested that the microglia derived toxicity resided in the ∼32 kDa protein. Moreover, the presence of the ∼32 kDa protein only in MGCM supplemented with BSA or protease inhibitors was consistent with previous suggestions of the protective nature of BSA on the microglia product (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ∼32 kDa NGF Protein Is Pro-NGF—To isolate the ∼32 kDa MGCM protein (MGCM/p32), MGCM/PI was fractionated by gel filtration, pooled into 5 fractions (Fig. 3A), and tested for biological activity or immunoreactivity for NGF. Majority of the proteins eluted in fraction III, as verified in silver stained acrylamide gels (data not shown). Treatment of 661w cells with fraction II resulted in significant (p < 0.001) decrease in cell numbers (42% of BM), as in cultures treated with MGCM/BSA (66% of BM)(Fig. 3B). A ∼32 kDa band reactive for NGF also separated in fraction II (Fig. 3C). No other fractions exhibited bands reactive for NGF or toxicity to 661w cells. MGCM/p32 was partially purified from fraction II using electroelution and tested for immunoreactivity to a polyclonal antipro-NGF antibody (30Beattie M.S. Harrington A.W. Lee R. Kim J.Y. Boyce S.L. Longo F.M. Bresnahan J.C. Hempstead B.L. Yoon S.O. Neuron. 2002; 36: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), using NGFβ as negative control. The anti-pro-NGF antibody reacted with the partially purified ∼32 kDa band (Fig. 3D) but not with NGFβ, suggesting that MGCM/p32 was pro-NGF. Pro-NGF Induces Photoreceptor Cell Death—To further establish that MGCM/p32 was pro-NGF, MGCM/p32, and recombinant furin-resistant pro-NGF (rProNGF) (23Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar) were added to cultured photoreceptor cells and tested for toxicity using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer (Fig. 4). Cells maintained in BM alone appeared flattened and rounded while cells treated with MGCM/p32 or rProNGF were spindle shaped with numerous phase bright and non-adherent cells under phase contrast. The number of cells labeled with ethidium homodimer appeared greater while fewer cells stained with calcein AM, suggestive of increased cell death, in the cultures treated with either MGCM/p32 or rProNGF compared with cells incubated in BM alone. The photoreceptor cell death caused by microglia-secreted products has been attributed to apoptosis in a previous report (24Roque R.S. Rosales A.A. Jingjing L. Agarwal N. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Brain Res. 1999; 836: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The"

However, the activation mechanisms of ADAMs remain elusive. To analyze the regulatory mechanisms of ADAM activation, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 as bait, and identified a protein that we designated Eve-1. Two cDNAs were cloned and characterized. They encode alternatively spliced isoforms of Eve-1, called Eve-1a and Eve-1b, that have four and five tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in the carboxyl-terminal region, respectively, and seven proline-rich SH3 domain binding motifs in the amino-terminal region. The short forms of Eve-1, Eve-1c and Eve-1d, translated at Met-371 are human counterparts of mouse Sh3d19. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Eve-1 is abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart. Western blot analysis revealed the dominant production of Eve-1c in human cancer cell lines. Knockdown of Eve-1 by small interfering RNA in HT1080 cells reduced the shedding of proHB-EGF induced by angiotensin II and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, as well as the shedding of pro-transforming growth factor-α, promphiregulin, and proepiregulin by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, suggesting that Eve-1 plays a role in positively regulating the activity of ADAMs in the signaling of EGFR-ligand shedding.

Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The transactivation of EGFR is mediated, in some cases, by EGFR ligand shedding. In particular, the shedding of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) (3Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 4Nanba D. Higashiyama S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) is known to have a prominent role in regulating the function of this growth factor. HB-EGF plays a physiological role by binding to and stimulating phosphorylation of the EGFR (5Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 6Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the EGF family, HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored form (proHB-EGF) and then processed to a bioactive soluble form (5Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 6Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process, called ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF, is an important post-translational modification that converts a tethered insoluble juxtacrine form into a soluble growth factor with autocrine/paracrine activity (7Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF is induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (7Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway also contributes to this proteolytic processing (8Gechtman Z. Alonson J.L.

In addition, GPCR agonists induce the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF, resulting in EGFR transactivation, which is a critical element in GPCR-induced mitogenic signaling (3Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). We identified a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12 (ADAM12) as a specific enzyme that catalyzes proHB-EGF shedding in EGFR transactivation by GPCR agonists, such as phenylephrine, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II, and results in cardiac hypertrophy (10Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Further, ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM17, matrix metalloproteases 3 and 7 as well as ADAM12 have been reported to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF (4Nanba D. Higashiyama S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) These reports suggest that the ectodomain shedding of EGFR ligands, especially HB-EGF, is key to the molecular mechanism of EGFR transactivation, which would be an important network of GPCR signaling. However, the pathway by which GPCR signaling links to the activation of ADAM enzymes is largely unknown. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of ADAM activation could clarify the signaling pathway of EGFR transactivation by GPCRs. ADAM12 is a single membrane-spanning protein with a metalloprotease domain in its extracellular portion, and several Src homology 3 (SH3) binding motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Therefore, it has been anticipated to interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that ADAM12 binds to p85α (11Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24466-24472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Src (12Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem.

Moreover, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 has been shown to interact with actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin-2 (15Galliano M.F. Huet C. Frygelius J. Polgren A. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13933-13939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated that these molecules could affect ADAM12 metalloprotease activity. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify ADAM12-binding proteins and discovered a protein containing SH3 domains that we designated Eve-1. We showed that Eve-1 binds not only ADAM12 but also ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM 17 and is involved in ADAM-mediated ectodomain shedding of several EGFR ligands, including proHB-EGF, proTGF-α, proamphiregulin and proepiregulin. Antibodies—Mouse anti-myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human ADAM10 and ADAM17 were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. and R&D Systems Inc., respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the cysteine-rich region of human ADAM12 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Sehara (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic region of pro-HB-EGF (H1) has been described previously (16Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Inui Y. Tamura S. Yamamoto K. Nishida M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 404-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Eve-1 polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant Eve-1c. Goat alkaline phosphatase (AP) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Promega. Goat rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from Chemicon. Expression Vectors and Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—We constructed a yeast expression plasmid encoding GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused with the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain by inserting ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain cDNA into the EcoRI and SalI multiple cloning sites of the pBTM116 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). ADAM12 full-length cDNA was cloned into the SacI and SalI sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). We prepared an adenovirus carrying a gene encoding FLAG epitope-tagged ADAM12 (ADAM12-FLAG) as described previously (10Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 and its truncated regions were cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pGEX6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Eve-1a and Eve-1b full-length cDNAs isolated from a human heart cDNA library by PCR were introduced into the SalI and NotI multiple cloning sites of the modified pME18S vector (pME18S-myc) that possesses an SRα promoter (17Tanabe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eve-1c and Eve-1d cDNAs were amplified using vectors with Eve-1a and Eve-1b inserted as templates, respectively, and cloned into the BglII and NotI sites of the pME18S-myc vector. A series of truncated mutants of the SH3 domains region of Eve-1b were cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pME18S-myc vector. The pME18S-myc vector was provided by Dr. K. Touhara (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Dharmacon Research Inc. chemically synthesized and purified siRNA duplexes. The siRNA sequence targeting Eve-1 corresponded to the coding region 155–175 (5′-AACCUUCUGUAGCUCCCAAAC-3′) relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon of Eve-1a (Eve-1b). This sequence had no substantial similarity to any other sequence in the NCBI data base. Scramble-siRNA directed against 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG-3′ was the negative control. No mammalian mRNAs contained this sequence in the NCBI data base. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast strain L40 containing pBTM116-ADAM12 (Cyto) was selected on synthetic complete media lacking tryptophan. A human heart cDNA library in pACT2 was sequentially introduced into the transformant, and yeast cells were plated onto synthetic complete media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of 3.5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Transformants grown on the dropout plates at 30 °C for 3–7 days were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Library plasmid DNA was recovered by transformation into Escherichia coli HB101 cells and sequenced. Northern Blot Analysis—Positively charged nylon membranes blotted with human poly(A)+ RNA (human 12-lane multitissue Northern blot, Bd Biosciences Clontech) was hybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled Eve-1 probe covering full-length cDNA. Hybridized membranes were placed in contact with BAS1000 plates (type Bas-IIIs) and investigated using the BAS1000 Bio-Image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). To confirm the reproducibility of the data, independent experiments were performed twice and human β-actin was the control probe. Cell Culture and Transfection—HT1080 cells and their stable transfectants that express AP-tagged proHB-EGF (HT1080/HB-EGF-AP cells), both AP-tagged proHB-EGF and angiotensin type I (AT1) receptor (HT1080/HB-EGF-AP/AT1 cells), AP-tagged proTGF-α (HT1080/TGF-α-AP cells), AP-tagged proamphiregulin (HT1080/AR-AP cells), or AP-tagged proepiregulin (HT1080/EPR-AP cells) were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HT1080 cells at 90% confluence in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 15 μg of the expression vectors for co-immunoprecipitation or pull-down assay with GST fusion proteins, and then incubated for 48 h. HT1080 cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 2.0 μg of pEYFP-N1-ADAM12 and 2.0 μg of pME18S-myc-Eve-1c for microscopic analysis or with 4.0 μg of siRNA for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis, and then incubated for 48 h. HT1080/HB-EGF-AP/AT1 and HT1080/HB-EGF-AP cells were transfected with 8.0 μg of siRNA (6-cm dishes) for cell surface biotinylation or with 0.8 μg of siRNA (per well of 24-well plates) for proHB-EGF-AP shedding assay and then incubated for 48 h. Preparation of Cell Extracts—The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biomedicals) (lysis buffer). After centrifugation for 10 min at 18,000 × g, the supernatant was collected as cell extract. Immunoprecipitation—The cell extract was incubated for 2 h with anti-myc antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, anti-HB-EGF antibody (H1), anti-TGF-α antibody, or anti-human placenta AP antibody (DakoCyto-mation Japan). Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Pull-down Assay with Immobilized GST Fusion Proteins—GST and GST fusion proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were employed. The cell extract was incubated with either GST or GST fusion proteins on the resin with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and either stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue or subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—Resolved proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted against the following primary antibodies: anti-myc antibody, anti-FLAG antibody, antiEve-1 antibody, anti-ADAM12 antibody, anti-ADAM10 antibody, or anti-ADAM17 antibody. The secondary antibody was AP or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates for AP or the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) for horseradish peroxidase. Cell Surface Biotinylation—The transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and biotinylated with 0.1 mg/ml of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl for 10 min on ice. Unreacted biotin was quenched by washing with Eagle's minimum essential medium/10% fetal bovine serum. The cell extract was harvested with lysis buffer as described above. Immunoprecipitation proceeded using anti-HB-EGF antibody (H1), anti-TGF-α antibody, or anti-human placenta AP antibody, and immunoblotting was performed as described above (7Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—Transfection proceeded as described above. Thereafter, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-myc antibody followed by goat rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Fluorescent images were acquired using a ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope. The thickness of optical sections was 0.8 μm. RT-PCR—Transfection proceeded as described above. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR proceeded using a primer pair specific for Eve-1 (5′-ATGGTTCTAGATCCCTTTCAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGCTGATCTGTAGAAACTG-3′). Shedding Assay Using AP-tagged Proteins—HT1080/HB-EGF-AP, HT1080/HB-EGF-AP/AT1, HT1080/TGF-α-AP, HT1080/AR-AP, or HT1080/EPR-AP cells were plated in 24-well plates and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 nm angiotensin II or TPA. Aliquots (100 μl) of conditioned media were transferred to 96-well plates, and AP activity was measured as described previously (18Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Identification by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening of Cytoplasmic Proteins That Interact with ADAM12—To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12, 3.0 × 106 clones of a human heart cDNA library were screened with the use of the yeast two-hybrid system and the ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain as bait. One of the isolated clones, A12-#2, contained a 2.8-kb insert encoding 297 amino acids characterized by four SH3 domains. BLAST searches for the A12-#2 cDNA sequence found that it was identical to the carboxylterminal region (amino acid residues 471–767) of a hypothetical protein with an open reading frame of 767 amino acids. We designated the full-length protein Eve-1 because it was the binding “partner” of ADAMs. Two full-length cDNAs that were simultaneously cloned by PCR from a human heart cDNA library, encoded predicted proteins of 767 and 790 amino acids without and with a 23 amino acid insertion, respectively. We designated these proteins Eve-1a and Eve-1b, respectively. Domain structural analysis revealed that Eve-1a and Eve-1b have four and five tandem SH3 domains in the carboxyl-terminal region, respectively. Seven proline-rich SH3 domain binding motifs, (R/K)XXPXXPorPXXPX(R/K) (19Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1242-1247Crossref Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 20Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Zhou X.M. Henry P.A. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), were also found in the amino-terminal region (Fig. 1, A and B). The short forms initially translated at Met-371 of Eve-1a and Eve-1b are human counterparts of mouse Sh3d19, which was recently identified as a novel adaptor protein (21Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Ito K. Ito M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We designated them Eve-1c and Eve-1d (Fig. 1, A and B). Genomic analysis of the Eve-1 gene revealed that Eve-1a and Eve-1b (Eve-1c and Eve-1d) are alternatively spliced isoforms from a single gene located on chromosome 4q31. Expression of Eve-1—Northern blotting analysis assessed the expression of Eve-1 mRNA in various human tissues. Hybridization with an Eve-1 probe detected a single 5.8-kb mRNA in most tissues, with relatively abundant expression in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and placenta and quite low expression in brain thymus, spleen, and leukocytes (Fig. 2A). To detect Eve-1 protein, human cancer cell lines (breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, colon cancer SW480 and WiDr cells, and fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells) were subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses. Eve-1 gene expression was detected in SW480, WiDr, and HT1080 cells but not in MDA-MB-231cells (Fig. 2B). Western blotting showed a common band among three cell lines (SW480, WiDr, and HT1080 cells) that completely co-migrated with recombinant Eve-1c (Fig. 2C). Addition of recombinant Eve-1c into HT1080 cell lysate resulted in the increase of the band corresponding to Eve-1c of the positive control and there was no appearance of any additional bands. However, this band was not detected in MDA-MB-231 cells. The bands corresponding to Eve-1a, Eve-1b, and Eve-1d were undetectable in all cell lines tested here. The lower band in SW480 and WiDr cells indicated by an asterisk might be another isoform or a degradation product. These data suggest that Eve-1c is predominantly produced in the tested cancer cell lines. Human Counterparts of Mouse Sh3d19 Eve-1c and Eve-1d Associate with ADAM12 in Mammalian Cells—Myc epitopetagged Eve-1a, Eve-1b, Eve-1c, or Eve-1d was transiently expressed in HT1080 cells, and showed the predicted size of each Eve-1 band (Fig. 3A). To confirm that Eve-1 can associate with ADAM12 in mammalian cells, both Eve-1 and ADAM12 were co-expressed in HT1080 cells. Fig. 3B shows that anti-myc antibody immunoprecipitated myc-Eve-1a, myc-Eve-1b, myc-Eve-1c, and myc-Eve-1d from cell lysates (Fig. 3B, bottom). Myc-Eve-1c and myc-Eve-1d co-immunoprecipitated endogenous ADAM12; 90 kDa corresponded to an active form that was detected by anti-ADAM12 antibody (Fig. 3B, top). However, neither myc-Eve-1a nor myc-Eve-1b co-immunoprecipitated endogenous ADAM12. Furthermore, to confirm that endogenous Eve-1c and Eve-1d can associate with ADAM12, ADAM12-FLAG was transiently expressed in HT1080 cells. Fig. 3C shows that ADAM12-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3C, top) and co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Eve-1c was detected by anti-Eve-1 antibody (Fig. 3C, bottom). None of the high molecular mass bands corresponding to Eve-1a, Eve-1b, or Eve-1d was detected by anti-Eve-1 antibody. Identification of Essential Regions Required for ADAM12-Eve-1 Interaction—To define the binding site of ADAM12 for Eve-1 and vice versa, we performed GST pull-down assay using a series of truncated mutants of cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 (Fig. 4A) or a series of truncated mutants of SH3 domains region of Eve-1d (Fig. 5A). Myc-Eve-1d bound to GST-P2–4, -P1–2, -P1–3, and -ADAM12 (Cyto) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, myc-Eve-1d did not bind to GST-P4, -P3–4, or -P1 (Fig. 4B). The same results were obtained using myc-Eve-1c (data not shown). These results suggest that P2 region (amino acid residues 829–840) of ADAM12 is required for the binding to Eve-1c or Eve-1d.Fig. 5Mapping of ADAM12 binding sites in Eve-1.A, schemes of SH3 domain region deletion mutants of Eve-1. B, ADAM12 binding to the deletion mutants. Extracts prepared from HT1080 cells expressing myc-tagged Eve-1 deletion mutants were incubated with GST or GST-ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain immobilized onto glutathione resin. Bound Eve-1 deletion mutants were detected by immunoblotting using anti-myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On the other hand, GST-ADAM12 (Cyto) bound myc-SH3-#1–5, -#3–5, -#2–4, -Δ#3, and -Δ#4 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, GST-ADAM12 (Cyto) did not bind myc-SH3-#1–2 and -Δ#3–4. In the panel of SH3-Δ#3–4, faint band corresponding to the sizeg of myc-SH3-Δ#3–4 is background of GST-fusion protein. These results suggest that the region containing SH3–3 and -4 domains of Eve-1d is required for binding to ADAM12. Colocalization of ADAM12 and Eve-1c—To intracellularly localize ADAM12 and Eve-1c, we transiently co-expressed ADAM12-EYFP and myc-Eve-1c in HT1080 cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that ADAM12-EYFP co-localized with myc-Eve-1c at the leading edge of the cell (arrowheads) (Fig. 6). Effect of Eve-1 on Ectodomain Shedding of proHB-EGF—We investigated the effect of Eve-1 on ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF, using siRNA-mediated mRNA destruction. First, to test the effect of Eve-1-siRNA on Eve-1 knockdown, RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses estimated levels of mRNA and protein, respectively. Eve-1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA isolated from HT1080 cells transfected with negative control Scramble-siRNA, but not with Eve-1-siRNA (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, we detected the much lesser amount of endogenous Eve-1c protein in the lysate from HT1080 cells transfected with Eve-1-siRNA than in those transfected with ScramblesiRNA (Fig. 7B). These experiments confirmed that Eve-1-siRNA destroyed Eve-1 mRNA. We further assessed the effect of Eve-1-siRNA on the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF. HT1080/HB-EGF-AP/AT1 cells were transfected with Scramble-siRNA or with Eve-1-siRNA, and then we measured AP activity in the conditioned medium of each transfectant after a 30-min incubation with 100 nm angiotensin II. Likewise, proHB-EGF-AP shedding induced by TPA was assayed using HT1080/HB-EGF-AP cells. Although the level of proHB-EGF-AP expression was almost equal (Fig. 7C), Eve-1 knockdown mediated by Eve-1-siRNA attenuated 65 and 70% of angiotensin II- and TPA-induced proHB-EGF-AP shedding, respectively (Fig. 7D). Because we reported previously that PACSIN3 binds ADAM12 cytoplasmic domain and up-regulated ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF (22Mori S. Tanaka M. Nanba D. Nishiwaki E. Ishiguro H. Higashiyama S. Matsuura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46029-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we further analyzed the simultaneous requirement of Eve-1 and PACSIN3 for the ectodomain shedding of proHB-EGF. Double knockdown of Eve-1 and PAC-SIN3 by using their siRNAs did not showed the enhanced suppression of proHB-EGF shedding induced by TPA or angiotensin II compared with the effect of the individual knockdown (Fig. 8), suggesting that both Eve-1 and PACSIN3 are equally required for the ADAM-induced proHB-EGF shedding. Eve-1c and Eve-1d Can Associate with ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 in Mammalian Cells—Several ADAMs contain proline-rich regions in their cytoplasmic tails, suggesting their possible interaction with Eve-1. To investigate whether Eve-1 can associate with the other ADAM members such as ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 implicated in the ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins, myc-tagged Eve-1a, Eve-1b, Eve-1c, or Eve-1d was transiently expressed in HT1080 cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antidbody. As shown in Fig. 9, endogenous ADAM10 (top) and ADAM17 (top middle) were co-immunoprecipitated with myc-Eve-1c and myc-Eve-1d. Co-expressed FLAG-tagged ADAM9 (bottom middle) and ADAM15 (bottom) were also co-immunoprecipitated with myc-Eve-1c and myc-Eve-1d. However, neither myc-Eve-1a nor myc-Eve-1b co-immunoprecipitated any endogenous or FLAG-tagged ADAM tested here. Effect of Eve-1 on Ectodomain Shedding of proTGF-α, Proamphiregulin, and Proepiregulin—We assessed the effect of Eve-1-siRNA on the ectodomain shedding of proTGF-α, proamphiregulin, and proepiregulin. As shown in Fig. 10, Eve-1-siRNA down-regulated ∼50% of TPA-induced proTGF-α-AP and proepiregulin-AP shedding and ∼40% of TPA-induced proamphiregulin-AP shedding, although their expression levels under the conditions of siRNA and scramble RNA treatments were almost equal in each. We searched for clues to help understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of ADAM-mediated proHB-EGF and the other EGFR-ligand shedding induced by GPCR agonists or TPA. We focused on ADAM12, which was recently identified as a shedding enzyme of proHB-EGF. Yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 as bait allowed isolation of a protein containing SH3 domains that we called Eve-1. The Eve-1 gene encodes at least two alternatively spliced isoforms, Eve-1a and Eve-1b. Eve-1a has an incomplete SH3 domain followed by four tandem SH3 domains. On the other hand, Eve-1b has additional 23 amino acids adjacent to the incomplete SH3 domain of Eve-1a, resulting in the production of another complete SH3 domain. That is, Eve-1b contains five SH3 domains, suggesting that these two isoforms are involved in ADAM regulation with functional differences. Our PCR analyses showed that the cloning ratio of Eve-1a and Eve-1b was ∼30:1, suggesting that Eve-1a is more abundant than Eve-1b in HT1080 cells. Mouse Sh3d19 is a novel adaptor protein (21Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Ito K. Ito M. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 31: 43-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that corresponds to a mouse counterpart of Eve-1d. Northern blotting revealed a single 5.8-kb mRNA of Eve-1, and siRNA designed for 155–175 coding region of Eve-1a open reading frame reduced Eve-1c protein production, suggesting that Eve-1a (Eve-1b) and Eve-1c (Eve-1d) are translated from a single mRNA. Western blotting revealed that the exogenous expression of Eve-1a (Eve-1b) did not produce Eve-1c (Eve-1d) (Fig. 3A), and that the Eve-1c was detected dominantly in human cancer cell lines tested here (Fig. 2), indicating the dominant usage of Met 371 as an initiation codon of Eve-1 translation. More precise analyses of the expression profiles of the Eve-1 isoforms in various tissues are required to understand their biological significance. Whereas the usual mechanism of translation in eukaryotes involves the recruitment of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the 5′-cap structure of the mRNA, a restricted but growing number of viral and cellular mRNA initiate their translation through the recruitment of the mRNA called internal ribosome entry site (23Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 24Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 25Bonnal S. Boutonnet C. Prado-Lourenco L. Vagner S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, Shc p52 and p46 are translated at the first ATG and the second ATG in exon 2a of the Shc gene, respectively (26Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G. Lai K.M. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), and fibroblast growth factor 2 has five isoforms alternatively translated from a single mRNA (27Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the fibroblast growth factor 2 internal ribosome entry site is 176 nucleotides long, is highly structured, and contains two RNA stem loops and a G quartet motif (28Bonnal S. Schaeffer C. Creancier L. Clamens S. Moine H. Prats A.C. Vagner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39330-39336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the upstream region of the Eve-1 mRNA has no typical G quartet motif, it is predicted to be highly structured, especially in nt sequences 151–651 and 888–1310, by computational structure prediction using Mfold (29Zuke M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10164) Google Scholar) (data not shown), suggesting the existence of an Eve-1 internal ribosome entry site for the alternative translation. Because the usage of alternative initiation codons of fibroblast growth factor 2 is controlled in transformed and stressed cells (30Vagner S. Touriol C. Galy B. Audigier S. Gensac M.C. Amalric F. Bayard F. Prats H. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the translation of Eve-1a (Eve-1b) and Eve-1c (Eve-1d) might be also controlled differently in normal and tumor cells. More precise analyses of Eve-1a (Eve-1b) and Eve-1c (Eve-1d) translation and detection of their proteins are required. On the other hand, analysis of the NCBI data base revealed that a transcript of Sh3d19 does not produce mouse counterparts of Eve-1b because of a stop codon located upstream of its coding region. The information retrieved from the data base suggests that Eve-1a and Eve-1b have unique functions in humans. Eve-1 has multiple SH3 domains, so we surmised that Eve-1 interacts with the proline-rich SH3 domain-binding motif(s) in the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12. A binding site for Eve-1 was mapped in the P2 region of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4). Furthermore, SH3–3 and -4 domains of Eve-1d were shown to be required for binding to the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM12 (Fig. 5). Thus, it is suggested that a subset of SH3 domains 3 and 4 of Eve-1 and P2 of ADAM12 are interactive. ADAM12 also interacts with p85α and Src, and the binding sites for these proteins are located in P2 or P4, and P2 of the ADAM12 cytoplasmic tail, respectively (11Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24466-24472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that several proteins containing SH3 domains share the Eve-1-binding site. Several members of the ADAM family, such as ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 as well as ADAM12 have such regions in their cytoplasmic tails (31Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Indeed, some of these ADAM proteins interact with signaling molecules containing an SH3 domain via their cytoplasmic domains (11Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24466-24472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12Kang Q. Cao Y. Zolkiewska A. Biochem.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4999-5007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, several proteins containing SH3 domains are likely to form complexes in the cytoplasmic domains of ADAMs. For example, endophilin I and SH3PX1 form complexes with ADAM9 and ADAM15 (32Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed myc-Eve-1c also co-immunoprecipitated ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM15, and ADAM17 as well as ADAM12 (Fig. 9). Because ADAM9, ADAM10, ADAM12, and ADAM17 have been shown to be involved multiply in the shedding of EGFR-ligands (4Nanba D. Higashiyama S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Sahin U. Weskam G. Zhou H. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Safting P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), it is easily speculated that Eve-1 is involved widely in the regulation of ectodomain shedding of EGFR-ligands. We demonstrated here that the knockdown of Eve-1 by siRNA in HT1080 cells significantly attenuated the shedding of proHB-EGF induced by angiotensin II and TPA (Fig. 9) as well as the shedding of proTGF-α, proamphiregulin, and proepiregulin induced by TPA (Fig. 10), suggesting that Eve-1 widely regulates ADAM-dependent post-translational processing of EGFR ligands. Thus, Eve-1 might be indispensable to the signaling of both angiotensin II and/or TPA-induced EGFR-ligand shedding. To qualify the physiological significance of interactions between Eve-1 and these ADAMs, however, further studies are required for ADAM-mediated ectodomain shedding of other membrane proteins and the other ADAM functions such as cell adhesion. We have identified very recently another SH3 domain-containing protein, PACSIN3, which can bind to ADAM12 and activate proHB-EGF shedding activity induced by angiotensin II and TPA (22Mori S. Tanaka M. Nanba D. Nishiwaki E. Ishiguro H. Higashiyama S. Matsuura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46029-46034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because it has not been reported whether ADAM-binding proteins such as endophilin I, SH3PX1, Src, p85α, Grb2, Fish, and α-actinin-2 could affect ADAM metalloprotease activity, Eve-1 and PACSIN3 are the first molecules that have been characterized as regulators of metalloprotease activity of ADAMs. Taken together, Eve-1, which was originally identified as an ADAM12-binding protein, is likely to play a physiological role as a binding partner of ADAMs in the signaling pathway of EGFR transactivation by GPCR agonists. Further analyses will clarify the signaling pathway from GPCRs to the shedding of proHB-EGF and the other EGFR ligands leading to EGFR transactivation."

Expression of the fmhB, femA, and femB genes of S. aureus in E. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. The Fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional S. aureus factors such as tRNAs used for amino acid activation. The PBPs of E. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and Gly instead of l-Ala at the N-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. Low affinity PBP2a of S. aureus conferred β-lactam resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. Thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the PBPs.

The bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan is a net-like macromolecule that completely surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane and supplies the cell with mechanical protection against its own osmotic pressure (1Höltje J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stress-bearing peptidoglycan is polymerized from a subunit containing β-1,4-linked GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) 1The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; d-Lac, d-lactate or d-lactoyl; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; BHI, brain heart infusion.1The abbreviations used are: MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; d-Lac, d-lactate or d-lactoyl; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; BHI, brain heart infusion. substituted by a peptide stem (2van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In the pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus, the stem peptide consists of a conserved pentapeptide (l-Ala1-d-iGln2-l-Lys3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5) and a variable side chain (see Fig. 1) (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Polymerization of the peptidoglycan subunit at the cell surface is performed by glycosyltransferases that catalyze elongation of the glycan strands by formation of β-1,4 bonds and d,d-transpeptidases that cross-link glycan strands (4van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter reaction is catalyzed by essential high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that cleave the C-terminal residue (d-Ala5) of a donor stem peptide and link the carboxyl group of the penultimate residue (d-Ala4) to the side chain amino group of an acceptor stem peptide (5Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.-M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). This two-step reaction involves formation of a covalent adduct between the β-hydroxyl of the active site serine of the PBPs and the carboxylate of d-Ala4 of the donor stem (acyl-enzyme) (5Jamin M. Wilkin J.M. Frère J.-M. Essays Biochem. 1995; 29: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). β-Lactam antibiotics are structural analogues of the d-Ala4-d-Ala5 extremity of peptidoglycan precursors that irreversibly inactivate the PBPs in a similar acylation reaction. Most bacterial species produce multiple PBPs that have partially overlapping functions (6Goffin C. Ghuysen J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multimodular PBPs associate a C-terminal d,d-transpeptidase module to N-terminal glycosyltransferase (class A) or non catalytic (class B) modules. Clinically relevant β-lactam resistance phenotypes in staphylococci and enterococci involve production of class B d,d-transpeptidases that are inefficiently acylated by β-lactams (commonly referred to as low affinity PBPs). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has acquired an additional pbp gene (mecA encoding low affinity PBP2a) presumably from a related staphylococcal species (7Wu S.W. de Lencastre H. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2417-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Resistance is an intrinsic property of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium because virtually all isolates are resistant to moderate (e.g. ampicillin) or high (e.g. ceftriaxone) levels of β-lactams and produce species-specific low affinity PBPs designated PBP5fs and PBP5fm, respectively (8Signoretto C. Boaretti M. Canepari P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Rice L.B. Carias L.L. Hutton-Thomas R. Sifaoui F. Gutmann L. Rudin S.D. Antimicrob.

Stefanic P. Coyette J. Charlier P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Diversification of the side chain structure during speciation (see Fig. 1) is potentially associated with diversification of the substrate specificity of the d,d-transpeptidases. In S. aureus, the FmhB transferase for incorporation of the first residue of the pentaglycine side chain (see Fig. 1) is an essential enzyme. This indicates that unsubstituted pentapeptide stems cannot be cross-linked (11Rohrer S. Ehlert K. Tschierske M. Labischinski H. Berger-Bächi B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9351-9356Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, femA and femB mutants of methicillin-resistant S. aureus are susceptible to methicillin. This suggests that a complete pentaglycine side chain is essential for the d,d-transpeptidase activity of PBP2a (12Strandén A.M. Ehlert K. Labischinski H. Berger-Bächi B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similarly, the side chain is essential for penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (13Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27768-27774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Inactivation of bppA1 encoding the transferase for incorporation of the first residue of the l-Ala-l-Ala side chain in E. faecalis has not been obtained (14Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Severin A. Tabei K. Hugonnet J.E. Shlaes D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Deletion of bppA2 led to production of precursors substituted by a single l-Ala and to impaired expression of intrinsic β-lactam resistance (14Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Severin A. Tabei K. Hugonnet J.E. Shlaes D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For these reasons, transferases of the Fem family are considered to be potential targets for the development of novel antibiotics active against β-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (15Kopp U. Roos M. Wecke J. Labischinski H. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In this study, we have further investigated the synthesis of the side chains of peptidoglycan precursors by transferases of the Fem family and their use by the PBPs in the cross-linking reaction. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that a narrow specificity of the PBPs could account for the essential role of transferases of the Fem family in peptidoglycan synthesis and β-lactam resistance. Heterospecific expression of genes encoding transferases and PBPs was used to manipulate the structure of the side chain of the peptidoglycan precursors and the PBPs responsible for their polymerization. We first determined whether heterospecific expression of the S. aureus fmhB, femA, and femB genes in E. faecalis leads to synthesis of mosaic side chains. Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analyses of uncross-linked muropeptide monomers revealed that the Fem transferases of S. aureus were functional in E. faecalis and retained their substrate specificity as displayed in the original host. The participation of the mosaic precursors in the cross-linking reaction was then deduced from the structure of cross-linked muropeptide dimers. Mosaic side chains were detected both at the donor and acceptor positions of the dimers, indicating that the transpeptidases of E. faecalis had a broad substrate specificity. In a second set of experiments, the mecA, pbp5fs, and pbp5fm were heterologously expressed in E. faecalis and E. faecium to evaluate the capacity of the corresponding low affinity PBPs to confer β-lactam resistance. PBP2a and PBP5fm were found to be functional in the heterologous hosts producing precursors with l-Ala-l-Ala and d-Asx side chains, reflecting again a broad substrate specificity. Thus, analysis of the different hybrid peptidoglycan assembly pathways revealed that the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis accounts for conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in staphylococci and enterococci, although the conservation of substrate structure is not essential for the transpeptidase activity of the PBPs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or agar (Becton Dickinson, le Pont de Claix, France) at 37 °C. Population analysis profiles were performed as previously described (16Tomasz A. Nachman S. Leaf H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C in BHI broth, and serial 10-fold dilutions were plated on BHI agar containing increasing concentrations of ceftriaxone (Roche Applied Science). Colony forming units were determined after 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. To study the stability of ceftriaxone resistance phenotypes, the bacteria were sequentially subcultured for 5 days in 10 ml of BHI broth by using 0.1 ml of the preceding overnight culture as the innoculum.Derivatives of expression vector pNJ2 harboring fem and pbp genes (see below) were introduced into E. faecalis JH2Sm::Tn916 (17Arbeloa A.

Mengin-Lecreulx D. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Spectinomycin (60 μg/ml) was used in all experiments to counter select loss of the plasmids.Plasmid Construction—The open reading frame and ribosome-binding site of the fem and mecA genes of S. aureus and of the pbp5fm gene of E. faecium were amplified and cloned under the control of the aph-A-3p promoter of the shuttle expression vector pNJ2 (17Arbeloa A. Segal H. Hugonnet J.-E. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Brouard J.-P. Gutmann L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mecA and fem genes of S. aureus Mu50 (21Hiramatsu K. Hanaki H. Ino T. Yabuta K. Oguri T. Tenover F. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1997; 40: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) were amplified with the following primers that contained SacI or XbaI restriction sites (underlined): mecA, 5′-TTGAGCTCATATAAGGAGGATATTGATG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGACGGATTGCTTCACTGTTTTG-3′; fmhB, 5′-TTGAGCT-CAGGTATTGTTAAATAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGAGAGCGTTCA-GATTTCAGTCG-3′; femA,5′-TTGAGCTCATTAACGAGAGACAAATA-GG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGACCTTCCTAAAAAATTCTGTC-3′; and femB, 5′-TTGAGCTCACAGAATTTTTTAGGAAGGG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGAG-CCCTAACATCATTTACATC-3′. The pbp5fm gene of E. faecium D344 (22Mainardi J.-L. Legrand R. Arthur M. Schoot B. van Heijenoort J. Gutmann L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16490-16496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was amplified with 5′-TTGAGCTCTTCCTCAAAGACATATGT-3′ and 5′-TTTCTAGATTATTGATAATTTTGGTTG-3′. The amplicons were cloned into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pNJ2 by using SacI and XbaI. The nucleotide sequence of the inserts in the resulting recombinant plasmids was determined. The construction of the pNJ2 derivative for expression of the pbp5fs gene of E. faecalis JH2–2 has been previously described (17Arbeloa A. Segal H. Hugonnet J.-E. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Brouard J.-P. Gutmann L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Arthur M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The fmhB, femA, and femB genes were cloned together into pNJ2 to obtain a policistrionic operon under control of the aphA-3p promoter in two steps. A SacI restriction fragment containing fmhB was recovered from pCR-BluntΩfmhB and cloned into the SacI site located upstream from femB in pNJ2ΩfemB. The resulting plasmid, pNJ2ΩfmhB femB, contained a unique SpeI restriction site located between fmhB and femB that was used to introduce the XbaI fragment of pCR-BluntΩfemA containing femA. The orientation of the three genes in the resulting plasmid, pNJ2ΩfmhB femA femB, was determined by restriction analysis and partial nucleotide sequencing.Preparation of Disaccharide Peptides—Bacteria were grown in 500 ml of BHI broth at 37 °C to an optical density at 650 nm of 0.7. Peptidoglycan was extracted by treating the bacterial pellet with 14 ml of 4% SDS at 100 °C for 30 min. Peptidoglycan was washed five times by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C) with 20 ml of water. Peptidoglycan was serially treated overnight at 37 °C with Pronase (200 μg/ml) in 1 ml of Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.4) and with trypsin (200 μg/ml) in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.8). Peptidoglycan was washed twice with 20 ml of water and digested overnight with mutanolysin (200 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and lysozyme (200 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in 1 ml of phosphate buffer (25 mm, pH 6.0) containing MgCl2 (0.1 mm). Mutanolysin and lysozyme were inactivated for 3 min at 100 °C, and soluble disaccharide peptides were recovered by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C).Reduction of Disaccharide Peptides—For reduction of MurNAc to N-acetylmuramitol, equal volumes (200 μl) of the solution of disaccharide peptides and of borate buffer (250 mm, pH 9.0) were mixed. Two mg of sodium borohydride were added, and the solution was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 4.0 with 20% orthophosphoric acid.Preparation of Lactoyl Peptides—The ether link internal to MurNAc was cleaved under alkaline conditions (23Klaic B. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 138: 65-72Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to produce lactoyl peptide peptidoglycan fragments. To the solution of unreduced disaccharide peptides (200 μl), 32% ammonium hydroxide (64 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. It was neutralized with acetic acid (61 μl), lyophilized, and dissolved in 200 μl of water containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid.Purification of Peptidoglycan Fragments—Reduced disaccharide peptides (200 μl) or lactoyl peptides (200 μl) were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Interchrom, Montluçon, France) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A 0 –20% gradient was applied between 10 and 90 min (solvent A: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B: 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). UV detection was performed at 210 nm. The relative abundance of peptidoglycan fragments was estimated as the percentage of the total integrated area. The peaks were individually collected, lyophilized, and dissolved in 100 μl of water.Determination of the Mass of Peptidoglycan Fragments—The mass spectral data were collected with an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer operating in the positive mode (Qstar Pulsar I, Applied Biosystems, Courtabœuf, France). Purified fractions (3 μl) of reduced disaccharide peptides or lactoyl peptides were directly injected into the mass spectrometer using HPLC pumps at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (acetonitrile 50%, water 49.5%, formic acid 0.5%, per volume). The data were acquired with a capillary voltage of 5,200 V and a declustering potential of 20 V. The mass scan range was from m/z 400 to 2,500, and the scan cycle was 1 s. Structure assignment of muropeptides based on mass was performed as previously described (14Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Severin A. Tabei K. Hugonnet J.E. Shlaes D. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45935-45941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Determination of the Structure of Monomers—Fragmentation performed on reduced disaccharide peptides and lactoyl peptides monomers gave essentially the same information on the structure of the peptide moieties of the molecules. Typical MS/MS experiments were performed by injecting 3–20 μl of the purified fractions, depending on the abundance of the peptidoglycan fragments, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, as described above. The declustering potential was set to 60 V, the ions were selected based on the m/z value ([M+H]1+) in the high resolution mode, and fragmentation was performed with nitrogen as the collision gas. Collision energy was typically of 25–28 and 36–40 eV for reduced disaccharide peptide and lactoyl peptide monomers, respectively.Raising the declustering potential to 120 V led to formation of fragments of the lactoyl peptides that were analyzed by MS/MS. Such an analysis was used to confirm the structure assignment of the fragments obtained by tandem mass spectrometry.Determination of the Structure of Multimers—Tandem mass spectrometry performed on reduced disaccharide peptide dimers provided little information on the peptide moiety of the molecules because fragmentation occurred mainly at the β-1,4-GlcNAc-MurNAc bonds. In contrast, the entire peptide sequence could be determined by analyzing lactoyl peptide peptidoglycan fragments. In a first set of experiments, fragmentation was performed on the doubly charged ions of the molecules ([M+2H]2+), which gave a higher current intensity than singly charged ions ([M+H]1+). The declustering potential was set to 60 V, and the collision energy was typically of 26–35 eV. Fragments resulting from loss of d-Lac-l-Ala1 moieties of the molecules (loss of 143 atomic mass units) and additional NH3 (17 atomic mass units) or NH3 + CONH3 (17 + 45 atomic mass units) in various combinations gave ions of high current intensities. Fragments generated by cleavage within the cross-bridges gave ions of lower intensity. The fragmentation pattern was also complicated by the presence of singly and doubly charged forms of certain fragments.Optimization of the fragmentation conditions for lactoyl peptide dimers was achieved by raising the declustering potential to 100 V, which increased the current intensity of the singly charged form of the molecules ([M+H]1+). Fragmentation performed with a declustering potential of 100 V on singly charged ions with a collision energy of 57–65 eV exclusively produced singly charged fragments. The highest intensities were observed for cleavage within the cross-bridges. The data reported under “Results” were performed under these conditions by using 7–35 μl of the purified fractions.RESULTSStructure of the Main Monomer Resulting from Heterospecific Expression of femA in E. faecalis JH2–2ΔbppA2—The femA gene, encoding the transferase required for incorporation of glycyl residues at the second and third positions of the pentaglycine side chain in S. aureus (Fig. 1C), was cloned into the expression vector pNJ2 to generate plasmid pNJ2ΩfemA and introduced into E. faecalis JH2–2ΔbppA2. The latter host produces precursors substituted by a single l-alanyl residue following deletion of the bppA2 gene (Fig. 1A). The most abundant monomers of JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA (Fig. 2, Peak 6) had a monoisotopic mass of 744.6, which matched the calculated value for a d-lactoyl-pentapeptide stem substituted by a side chain consisting of one l-alanyl and two glycyl residues. The structure of this branched peptide was solved by MS/MS, based on the detection of specific ions generated by loss of residues from the N terminus of the side chain (l-Ala-Gly-Gly-Nter) and from the carboxyl (d-Ala4-d-Ala5-Cter) or hydroxyl (OH-d-Lac-l-Ala1-d-iGln) extremities of the lactoyl-pentapeptide stem (Fig. 3). The interpretation of the fragmentation pattern (Fig. 3B) was confirmed by MS/MS performed on fragments of the molecule, as exemplified by fragmentation of the ion at m/z 474.3 (Fig. 4). The structure of the main monomer determined by these approaches (Figs. 3 and 4) indicates that FemA of S. aureus is functional in E. faecalis because it catalyzed the addition of two glycyl residues after the l-alanyl residue incorporated by BppA1.Fig. 2Structural analysis of peptidoglycan from JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA.A, purified peptidoglycan was digested with muramidases and treated with ammonium hydroxide producing d-lactoyl peptide fragments that were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm (absorbance unit × 103). B, model d-lactoyl peptide showing the main variations (boxed) in the free C terminus of the acceptor peptide stem, the cross-bridge, and the free N-terminal side chain. C, peaks 1–16 were individually collected, lyophilized, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The relative abundance (%) of material in the 16 peaks was calculated by integration of the absorbance at 210 nm. The structure was deduced from the observed monoisotopic mass and, for most lactoyl peptides (indicated by stars), directly determined by tandem mass spectrometry. The most abundant d-lactoyl peptides, based on the relative absorbance at 210 nm and current intensity, are indicated in bold type. Tri, tripeptide l-Ala1-d-iGln2-l-Lys3; Tetra, tetrapeptide l-Ala1-d-iGln2-l-Lys3-d-Ala4; Penta, pentapeptide, l-Ala1-d-iGln2-l-Lys3-d-Ala4-d-Ala5; d-iGlu, the α-carboxyl group of the second residue was not amidated. Gly C-ter, Gly instead of d-Ala at the 5th (C-terminal position) of pentapeptide stems.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Analysis of the main monomer from JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA by tandem mass spectrometry.A, fragmentation was performed on the ion at m/z 745.6 corresponding to the [M+H]1+ from the major monomer. B, structure of the major monomer and inferred fragmentation pattern. The boxed m/z values in A originate from cleavage at single peptide bonds as represented in B. Peaks at m/z 631.5 and 560.4 matched the predicted values for loss of two N-terminal glycyl residues and of an additional l-alanyl residue, respectively. Loss of one and two d-Ala from the C terminus of the pentapeptide stem gave ions at m/z 656.5 and 585.4. Further loss of NH3 gave peaks at m/z 639.4 and 568.4. Fragmentation of the d-Lac-l-Ala1 amide bond was not observed. The peak at m/z 602.4 matched the predicted value for loss of d-Lac-l-Ala1. Further loss of NH3 and additional CONH3 led to peaks at m/z 585.4 and 540.4. Cleavage of the same peptide bond also produced peaks at m/z 144.0 and 116.0 corresponding to the d-Lac-l-Ala1 moiety of the molecule and loss of CO, respectively. Fragmentation at the d-iGln2-l-Lys3 peptide bond produced ions at 272.1 and 474.3. Additional loss of NH3 from ion at 474.3 gave an ion at 457.3. Additional ions could be accounted for by combinations of the fragmentations described above. In particular, loss of d-Ala4-d-Ala5 and d-Lac-l-Ala1 gave an ion at m/z 442.3. Further loss of NH3 and CONH3 led to peaks at m/z 425.3 and 380.2, respectively. Similarly, loss of d-Ala5 and d-Lac-l-Ala1 gave ions at m/z 513.3, 496.3, and 451.3. Peaks at m/z 471.3 matched the predicted value for loss of d-Ala5 and the l-Ala-Gly-Gly side chain. Peaks at m/z 289.2 and 314.2 matched the expected mass of l-Lys3 substituted by d-Ala4-d-Ala5 and l-Ala-Gly-Gly, respectively. Further fragmentation of the ion at m/z 314.2 led to ion at m/z 269.1 following loss of CONH3. Finally, ions at m/z 257.1 and 84.0 could correspond to d-iGln2-l-Lys3 and the immonium derivative of l-Lys. Loss of NH3 and additional CONH3 from peak at m/z 257.1 gave ions at 240.1 and 195.1, respectively. Together, these fragmentations account for the 29 ions with the highest relative current intensity. Ions of lower intensity could be accounted for by additional combinations of fragmentations (unlabeled peaks).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Tandem mass spectrometry analysis of ion at m/z 474.3 corresponding to a fragment of the main monomer from JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA. Tandem mass spectrometry (A) and inferred fragmentation pattern (B). The boxed m/z values in A originate from cleavage at single peptide bonds as represented in B. The peak at m/z 456.2 matched the predicted value for loss of H2O. The peaks at m/z 417.2, 360.2, and 289.2 matched the predicted value for loss of N-terminal Gly, Gly-Gly, and l-Ala-Gly-Gly from the side chain. Loss of the C-terminal d-Ala5 and additional CO gave ions at m/z 385.2 and 357.2, respectively. Loss of d-Ala4-d-Ala5 and additional CO or CONH3 gave ions at m/z 314.2, 286.2, and 269.2, respectively. Peak at m/z 328.2 matched the predicted value for loss of one Gly from the side chain and d-Ala5. The additional loss of one Gly resulted in peak at m/z at 271.2 and further loss of CO resulted in peak at 243.2. Peak at m/z 200.1 could correspond to the mass of l-Lys3 substituted by d-Ala4 or l-Ala, and further loss of CONH3 would lead to peak at m/z 155.1. The peak at m/z 186.1 matched the predicted value for the side chain l-Ala-Gly-Gly. Finally, peaks at m/z 129.1 and 84.1 could correspond to the l-Lys residue and its immonium ion, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structure of Secondary Monomers from JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA—Muropeptide diversity was thoroughly investigated based on MS/MS analysis of the monomers (Fig. 2). In the order of decreased abundance, the first polymorphism was generated by the presence of side chains consisting of a single l-Ala (peak 4, 15.7%) instead of the sequence l-Ala-Gly-Gly (peak 6, 18.5%; see above). Side chains generated by BppA1 alone (l-Ala) or BppA1 and FemA (l-Ala-Gly-Gly) were therefore both produced by JH2–2ΔbppA2/pNJ2ΩfemA. Lactoyl peptides with side chains consisting of the sequence l-Ala-Gly were present in small amounts. Residues other than l-Ala were not detected at the first position of the side chains. Residues other than Gly were not detected at the second and third positions. Side chains containing glycyl residues were not detected in JH2–2 and JH2–2ΔbppA2 (14Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Severin A.

This block is characterized by an extensive decrease in the expression of proteins associated with the function of the mature fat cell, most notably C/EBPα, adiponectin, perilipin, and the adipose-specific fatty acid-binding protein, FABP4/aP2. Since the expression of these proteins lies downstream of PPARγ, we overexpressed PPARγ in Swiss mouse fibroblasts to promote adipocyte differentiation. We show that FoxC2 blocks the ability of PPARγ to induce adipogenic gene expression in response to exposure of the cells to dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and a PPARγ ligand. Interestingly, the expression of aP2 escapes the inhibitory action of FoxC2 under conditions that promote maximum PPARγ activity. In contrast, FoxC2 inhibits the expression of C/EBPα, perilipin, and adiponectin even in the presence of potent PPARγ ligands. Finally, we show that FoxC2 does not affect the ability of PPARγ to bind to or transactivate from a PPARγ response element. These data suggest that FoxC2 blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting the capacity of PPARγ to promote the expression of a subset of adipogenic genes.

These data suggest that FoxC2 blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting the capacity of PPARγ to promote the expression of a subset of adipogenic genes. Adipose tissue, once thought to be just a storage depot for excess energy supply, is now realized to be a fully functioning endocrine organ, secreting numerous factors that help to maintain normal whole body metabolism (1Trayhurn P.

Significant changes in adipose mass or perturbation in adipocyte signaling can result in the disruption of overall metabolic homeostasis (3Bergman R.N. Van Citters G.W. Mittelman S.D. Dea M.K.

Changes in adipose mass can result from increased lipid storage in preexisting adipocytes as well as an increase in adipocyte number through the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes (5Prins J.B. O'Rahilly S. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1997; 92: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The differentiation of preadipocytes into mature insulin-responsive adipocytes results from coordinated signaling cascades descending on many transcription factors that promote the expression of terminal adipogenic genes (4Morrison R.F.

Much of what is known regarding the transcriptional events of adipogenesis has been gained through the use of cell lines predisposed to the adipocyte lineage. The most frequently used are the 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A cell lines (7Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 8Green H. Kehinde O.

Signaling events that induce adipogenesis promote both the increased expression of some factors as well as the down-regulation of others.

In fact, the expression of both PPARγ and C/EBPα is necessary and sufficient for complete adipogenesis to occur (14Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P. Chien K.R. Koder A.

In addition, the inducers of adipocyte differentiation promote the down-regulation of factors that maintain the undifferentiated state of preadipocytes. Members of both the GATA family as well as factors in the Wnt signaling pathway act as negative regulators of adipogenesis, and their maintained expression during differentiation blocks terminal adipogenesis (18Bennett C.N.

More recently, members of the forkhead (FOX) family of transcription factors have been identified as playing both positive and negative roles in adipocyte differentiation. Forkhead transcription factors have been shown previously to play varying roles during early development by regulating growth, differentiation, and apoptosis of different cell types (22Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar, 23Alvarez B. Martinez A.C. Burgering B.M. Carrera A.C.

They bind as monomers to the consensus sequence 5′-TGACCTTTGACCT-3′, and selective binding is dictated by flanking sequences as well as the relative abundance of individual members. The affinity of FOX proteins to bind to sequences overlaps to a great extent between members, and in addition, some FOX proteins primarily act as transcriptional activators while others act as transcriptional repressors (24Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that specific FOX family members, FoxO1, FoxA2, and FoxC2, play a role in maintaining normal metabolic homeostasis in the adult organism. FoxO1 expression increases during adipogenesis, and its transcriptional activity is negatively regulated by insulin signaling through Akt phosphorylation during the early phase of adipogenesis. Overexpression of a constitutively active FoxO1 blocks adipocyte differentiation as a result of induced expression of the tumor suppressor, p21CIP, and the concurrent block in clonal expansion (25Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 26Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of FoxA2 also inhibits adipocyte differentiation, and it is induced in an obese diabetic mouse, proposing a role for negative feedback against adipocyte differentiation. FoxA2 induces the expression of pref-1, a known inhibitor of adipogenesis (27Boney C.M. Fiedorek Jr., F.T. Paul S.R. Gruppuso P.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2923-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as well as genes that function in glucose and lipid metabolism (28Wolfrum C. Shih D.Q. Kuwajima S. Norris A.W. Kahn C.R. Stoffel M. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). FoxC2 has been shown to have an effect on the formation of white and brown adipose tissue in rodents. Its expression in mice is restricted to adipose tissue, and overexpression of FoxC2 targeted to adipose tissue results in attenuation of white adipose tissue formation while brown adipose development is grossly enhanced (29Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Data from those mice indicate an increase in insulin sensitivity and more efficient signaling though β-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, the expression of FoxC2 is up-regulated in mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes upon exposure to insulin and tumor necrosis factor α (30Gronning L.M. Cederberg A. Miura N. Enerback S. Tasken K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The dramatic decrease in the white adipose depots in FoxC2 transgenic mice suggested that FoxC2 might act to suppress white adipogenesis. Consequently, our goal in this study is to determine whether FoxC2 blocks the differentiation of white preadipocytes and, if so, to begin to identify the molecular mechanisms regulating such an inhibitory action. We show that inducible overexpression of FoxC2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes inhibits adipogenesis and that, more specifically, it blocks the expression of several known PPARγ downstream targets that function in the mature adipocyte. These observations led us to create a cell line whose capacity to undergo adipogenesis is directly dependent on the expression and activity of PPARγ. To this end, we employed Swiss mouse fibroblasts, which constitutively express PPARγ. In these cells, we inducibly overproduced FoxC2 and found that its expression results in a significant attenuation in the capacity of these fibroblasts to undergo adipogenesis. Furthermore, the degree of attenuation appears to be selective for individual PPARγ downstream targets. Finally, we show that FoxC2 does not alter the ability of PPARγ to bind or transactivate a PPARγ response element, indicating that FoxC2 functions at a location downstream of PPARγ. Plasmids and Cell Lines—Stocks of 3T3-L1 cells expressing the Tet-Off regulator protein (3T3L1-TET) were a kind gift of Jacques Pairault (UMR7079 CNRS UPMC, Paris, France). The FoxC2-pLNCX plasmid (mfh1) was a kind gift of Dr. Brigid Hogan (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). FoxC2 cDNA was amplified out of FoxC2-pLNCX by PCR and then cloned into His-Topo-pCDNA3-V5 (Invitrogen). The FoxC2 cDNA now tagged with the V5 epitope sequence was then cloned into pBI-G (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using blunt end ligation. The resulting FoxC2-V5-pBI-G plasmid, along with a puromycin selection plasmid (pBABE-puro), was transfected into 3T3-L1-TET cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Colonies of cells resistant to 2 μg/ml puromycin were selected and analyzed for expression of the pBI-G vector on the basis of tetracycline-responsive β-galactosidase production. The initial selection gave rise to several non-homogeneous colonies with only 10–20% of the cells expressing β-galactosidase activity. One of these colonies was subjected to serial dilution single-cell cloning. Colonies were selected on the basis that nearly the entire population of cells expressed β-galactosidase activity in a tetracycline-responsive manner. The pBABE-PPARγ plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Dana Farber Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The pBABE-PPARγ plasmid was transfected into Swiss mouse 3T3 fibroblasts constitutively expressing the Tet-Off activator protein (Clontech). Primary colonies were selected using 100 μg/μl hygromycin. This initial selection gave rise to several non-homologous colonies, one of which was subjected to serial dilution. Colonies were selected based on their ability to undergo adipogenesis when exposed to the standard induction mixture along with 5 μm troglitazone. Several colonies were selected and analyzed. A single colony, termed Swiss-Pγ, was chosen on the basis that it was representative of the other populations and was subjected to further manipulation. The FoxC2-V5-pBI-G plasmid, along with pBABE-puro, was transfected into Swiss-Pγ cells using FuGENE 6. Colonies of cells resistant to 2 μg/ml puromycin were selected and analyzed for the expression of the pBI-G vector on the basis of tetracycline-responsive β-galactosidase production. The initial selection gave rise to several non-homogeneous colonies with only 10–20% of the cells expressing β-galactosidase activity. One of these colonies was subjected to serial dilution single-cell cloning. Colonies were selected on the basis that nearly the entire population of cells expressed β-galactosidase activity in a tetracycline-responsive manner. Cell Culture—Stocks of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (7Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) and 3T3L1-FoxC2 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 25 mm d-glucose and supplemented with 10% donor calf serum. For experiments, cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Induction of differentiation was achieved by treatment with the standard induction mixture (DMI) containing dexamethasone (1 mm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.5 mm), and insulin (1.67 μm) on 2-day post-confluent cells. Cells were maintained in this differentiation mixture for 48 h after which time the media was changed to DMEM with 10% FBS and insulin (835 nm). 48 h prior to induction, 3T3-L1-FoxC2 cells were exposed to 3 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma) for 24 h to enhance ectopic FoxC2 expression. The Swiss-Pγ-FoxC2 cells were differentiated using the previously mentioned mixture of inducers along with 5 μm troglitazone (Roche-Davis/Warner Lambert, Ann Arbor, MI). Additional ligands were also used at 1 μm of a specific PPARγ agonist, GW7845 (GlaxoSmithKline), and 1 μm rosiglitazone (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). The PPARγ antagonist T0070907 was obtained from AdipoGenix, Inc. (Boston, MA) and used at 10 μm as described previously (31Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Cyclohexamide (Sigma) and MG132 (Calbiochem) were used at 5 μg/ml and 12.5 μm, respectively. Oil Red O Staining—Staining was performed following the procedure described previously (32Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells then were photographed using phase-contrast microscopy. Preparation of Whole Cell and Nuclear Extracts—Cultured cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4 pH 7.4). For total extracts, cells were harvested in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% SDS, 5 μm aprotonin, and 50 μm leupeptin and lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm. For nuclear protein extracts, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After a low speed centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol) and then incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at full speed (13,000 rpm) at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were stored at –80 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Proteins were analyzed by SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Following transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline-0.1% Tween 20 and probed with the antibodies specified below. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and ECL substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for detection of specific proteins. Antibodies—The perilipin antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Andrew Greenberg (Tufts University, Boston, MA). Anti-aP2 serum was kindly provided by Dr. David Bernlohr (University of Minnesota). Antibodies against PPARγ, C/EBPα, and C/EBPβ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-V5 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen, and the adiponectin antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Electromobility Shift Assays—Electromobility shift assays were performed as described previously (32Wu Z. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4128-4136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences for PPAR response element (PPRE) (DR-1) and FOXRE were 5′-AGCTACGTGACCTTTGACCTGGT-3′ and 5′-CCAGGTTGTTTATTTAGTGT-3′, respectively. Analysis of RNA—Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Following quantification, messenger RNA was assayed in equivalent amounts of total RNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) as described previously (33Han J. Farmer S.R. Kirkland J.L. Corkey B.E. Yoon R. Pirtskhalava T. Ido Y. Guo W. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Primer sequences used for amplification were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., based on the published sequences in the GenBank™ (sequences are available upon request). All of the PCR reactions were performed in the linear range of cycle number for each set of primers, and the corresponding products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Reporter Assays—Swiss-Pγ-FoxC2 cells were plated and grown to ∼50% confluency at which time they were changed to media containing the appropriate tetracycline condition. Two days later, at ∼85% confluency, the cells were transfected with 4 μg of DR-1-LUC (a gift from Dr. Jackie Stephens, Louisiana State University) and 0.04 μg of pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) using FuGENE 6. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were split into the standard induction mixture of DMI and their appropriate ligand and tetracycline condition. 48 h later, the medium was changed to the established tetracycline and ligand condition. The cells were harvested the following day and analyzed for luciferase activity and protein expression. Luciferase activity was measured using the DLRII kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Overexpression of FoxC2 Blocks Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes—Overexpression of FoxC2 in adipose tissue results in decreased white adipose mass as shown by Cederberg et al. (29Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell. 2001; 106: 563-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In addition, the exposure of 3T3-F422A preadipocytes to insulin or tumor necrosis factor α has been shown to both induce FoxC2 expression and inhibit adipocyte differentiation (30Gronning L.M. Cederberg A. Miura N. Enerback S. Tasken K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To better understand the molecular mechanisms by which FoxC2 inhibits white adipose tissue formation, we employed the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (7Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Using the tetracycline-inducible expression system, we conditionally overexpressed FoxC2 tagged with a V5 epitope in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes expressing the Tet-Off regulator protein. Multiple clones were isolated and subjected to preliminary experiments. Of those clones, a single clone representative of the pool was chosen on the basis of regulated FoxC2 expression and its ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes. To monitor the expression of both the endogenous and ectopic FoxC2 mRNAs in this cell line, we adopted a RT-PCR screen using different primers to select for the respective mRNAs. The total and ectopic FoxC2 mRNAs were assayed using a common upstream primer and downstream primers targeted against an internal FoxC2 sequence and the V5 epitope sequence, respectively. Other groups have shown that endogenous FoxC2 expression is significantly up-regulated in differentiated 3T3-F442A cells and to a lower extent in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells when they are exposed to insulin for 2 h. Fig. 1a demonstrates that the culture of 3T3-L1-FoxC2 cells in the absence of tetracycline induces the expression of ectopic mRNA to levels expressed by the endogenous gene when cells are exposed to insulin. These data indicate that the inducible expression system is producing physiological levels of FoxC2 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Fig. 1b shows that the expression of the ectopic mRNA results in the production of a V5-tagged FoxC2 protein only in cells cultured in the absence of tetracycline. To determine how FoxC2 expression affects adipogenesis, 3T3-L1-FoxC2 cells were induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 4 days using the standard differentiation mixture of dexamethasone (DEX), isobutylmethylxanthine (MIX), and insulin. Samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis for various transcription factors and markers of terminal adipogenesis (Fig. 2). In the absence of FoxC2, both PPARγ and C/EBPα are induced by day 2 and abundantly expressed by day 3, leading to increased expression of perilipin, adiponectin, and aP2 by day 4. Culture in the absence of tetracycline results in abundant expression of the V5-tagged FoxC2 protein, which leads to the inhibition of the adipogenic proteins including PPARγ and C/EBPα. FoxC2 Inhibits Adipogenesis at a Step Downstream of PPARγ2—It is generally accepted that terminal differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes depends to a great extent on the activity of PPARγ. In fact, the expression of PPARγ itself requires its continual activation through a positive feedback loop involving C/EBPα (34Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is possible that the effects of FoxC2 on adipogenic gene expression observed in Fig. 2 may result from an inhibition of PPARγ activity. To better understand the mechanisms by which FoxC2 inhibits differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we employed a system in which adipogenesis in Swiss mouse fibroblasts is driven by ectopic PPARγ expression and activity. In this cell line, we conditionally overexpressed FoxC2 using the Tet-Off system, giving rise to a cell line termed Swiss-Pγ-FoxC2. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from these cells cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline demonstrates that the expression of FoxC2 is tightly regulated by tetracycline (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the ectopic FoxC2 tagged with a V5 epitope can bind to a FOX response element and this complex can be supershifted with the addition of a V5 antibody (Fig. 3b). Swiss-Pγ-FoxC2 cells were induced to differentiate by exposure to DEX, MIX, and insulin for 4 days in the presence or absence of tetracycline, and total cell proteins were harvested for Western blot analysis. In the absence of FoxC2, PPARγ promotes the expression of several markers of adipogenesis including perilipin, adiponectin, and aP2 (Fig. 3c). Under these culture conditions (i.e. exposure to DEX, MIX, and insulin), ∼20% of the cells become round and accumulate lipid droplets (Fig. 4a, –TROG, +TET). Ectopic expression of FoxC2 blocked this low level of morphological differentiation (Fig. 4a, –TROG, –TET) and also blocked the expression of adipogenic mRNAs (Fig. 3c). The small percentage of lipid laden cells following exposure to DEX, MIX, and insulin suggests that the activity of PPARγ is below optimal levels when compared with the level of differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. To assess whether FoxC2 is capable of inhibiting adipogenesis when PPARγ is fully active, we exposed the cells to a potent PPARγ ligand in addition to the standard adipogenic mixture. In fact, in the absence of FoxC2, differentiation of the cells in the presence of 5 μm troglitazone (PPARγ ligand) results in greater than 90% of the population accumulating lipid droplets (Fig. 4a, +TROG, +TET) compared with only 20% of the population in the absence of the exogenous PPARγ ligand (Fig. 4a, –TROG, +TET). More importantly, FoxC2 is capable of inhibiting lipid accumulation under conditions (+ troglitazone) promoting optimal PPARγ activity (Fig. 4a, +TROG, –TET). To analyze the relationship between PPARγ activity and the inhibitory effect of FoxC2 on adipogenic gene expression, cells were stimulated to differentiate in the presence or absence of tetracycline with increasing concentrations of troglitazone for 6 days and proteins were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4b demonstrates that, in the absence of FoxC2 (+ tetracycline), there is a troglitazone dose-dependent increase in the expression of perilipin, adiponectin, C/EBPα, and aP2 and a corresponding decrease in the abundance of the PPARγ2 protein. In contrast, the ectopic expression of FoxC2 significantly attenuates the expression of the adipogenic genes at all concentrations of troglitazone tested. Interestingly, higher doses of troglitazone appear to partially overcome the inhibitory effect of FoxC2 on aP2 expression (Fig. 4b, lanes 9 and 11). Previous studies have shown that the proteasomal-mediated degradation of PPARγ2 correlates with PPARγ activity (35Hauser S. Adelmant G. Sarraf P. Wright H.M. Mueller E. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18527-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 36Floyd Z.E. Stephens J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4062-4068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, even in the presence of FoxC2, troglitazone is still capable of facilitating the down-regulation of PPARγ2 protein, suggesting that FoxC2 is not blocking this process. However, it is important to point out that, in the absence or at low doses of troglitazone, FoxC2 appears to increase the abundance of PPARγ2 (Figs. 3b and 4b, lanes 5 and 6), which is consistent with the notion that at suboptimal PPARγ2 activity (low doses of ligand) FoxC2 can directly inhibit PPARγ2 activity resulting in its extended lifespan. Furthermore, at of these same low doses of troglitazone, FoxC2 significantly attenuates aP2 expression. To determine whether PPARγ ligands other than troglitazone are capable of counteracting the inhibitory effect of FoxC2, Swiss-Pγ-FoxC2 cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of GW347845, rosiglitazone, or troglitazone (Fig. 5a). The inhibitory effect of FoxC2 is evident in the presence of all three ligands as shown by a FoxC2-dependent inhibition of perilipin, C/EBPα, and adiponectin. Again, aP2 seems to escape this inhibitory action of FoxC2. A plausible explanation for this apparent absence of effect on aP2 expression is that the aP2 protein may be significantly more stable than the other markers of terminal adipogenesis. To determine whether FoxC2 is inhibiting transcription of the aP2 gene as well as the other genes, we measured th"

The 160-kDa NAIP contains three distinct regions: an amino-terminal cluster of three baculoviral inhibitory repeat (BIR) domains, a central nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD), and a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. The presence of the NOD and LRR domains renders NAIP unique among the IAPs and suggests that NAIP activity is regulated in a manner distinct from that of other members of the family. In this report, we examined the interaction of various regions of NAIP with caspase-9 and Smac. Recombinant NAIPs with truncations of the carboxyl-terminal LRR or NOD-LRR regions bound to caspase-9. In contrast, the full-length protein did not, suggesting some form of structural autoregulation. However, the association of the wild type full-length protein with caspase-9 was observed when interaction analysis was performed in the presence of ATP. Furthermore, mutation of the NAIP ATP binding pocket allowed full-length protein to interact with caspase-9. Thus, we conclude that NAIP binds to caspase-9 with a structural requirement for ATP and that in the absence of ATP the LRR domain negatively regulates the caspase-9-inhibiting activity of the BIR domains. Interestingly, and in contrast to the X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), NAIP-mediated inhibition of caspase-9 was not countered by a peptide containing an amino-terminal IAP binding motif (IBM). Consistent with this observation was the failure of Smac protein to interact with the NAIP BIR domains. These results demonstrate that NAIP is distinct from the other IAPs, both in demonstrating a ligand-dependent caspase-9 interaction and in demonstrating a distinct mechanism of inhibition.

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a controlled process of cellular disassembly that occurs in response to internal or external apoptotic signals. Caspases, a class of cysteine proteases, are activated in a cascade in most apoptotic pathways. Caspases proteolytically digest specific substrates and are responsible for most of the characteristic morphological changes of an apoptotic cell. The activity of the caspases is restrained through a family of proteins termed inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; NAIP, neuronal apoptosis-inhibitory protein; XIAP, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; NOD, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; IBM, IAP binding motif; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Ipaf, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme protease-activating factor.

These proteins all require proteolytic processing to expose an amino-terminal tetrapeptide sequence termed an IAP binding motif (IBM). IBM-containing proteins bind to a site on BIR3, inhibiting that site from interacting with the amino terminus of the small subunit of partially processed caspase-9. Although the antiapoptotic and caspase-3/7-inhibitory activities of NAIP have been documented previously (4Maier J.K. Lahoua Z. Gendron N.H. Fetni R. Johnston A. Davoodi J. Rasper D. Roy S.

Neurotrauma. 2001; 18: 1333-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), NAIP interaction with caspase-9 and the effects of Smac on this interaction have not been investigated. Although the BIR domains endow NAIP with structural and functional similarities to other members of the IAP family of proteins, NAIP is unique in that it possesses a NOD. NOD-containing proteins are a diverse group with functions ranging from involvement in apoptosis (i.e. Apaf-1) to pathogen recognition (i.e. plant R genes) (24Inohara N. Nunez G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6473-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Chamaillard M. Girardin S.E. Viala J. Philpott D.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). As the name implies, the NOD is proposed to mediate oligomerization in a nucleotide-dependant manner. Many of the NOD-containing proteins consist of an amino-terminal “effector” domain (such as the CARD of Apaf-1), the central NOD, and a carboxyl-terminal “sensor” domain (such as the WD-40 repeats of Apaf-1 that bind cytochrome c). Given the organizational similarity between NAIP and the NOD proteins, we investigated the effects of the NOD and LRR domains of NAIP with respect to the activity of the amino-terminal BIR domains. In this report we show that the BIR3 domain of NAIP is capable of interaction with caspase-9 but not with Smac. However, in the context of the full-length protein, this interaction depends on the presence of ATP. Surprisingly, ATP binding does not appear to alter the quarternary structure of NAIP. Our results suggest that ATP binding to the NOD triggers a conformational change that activates BIR3-mediated caspase-9 inhibition that is not modulated by Smac. Expression and Purification of XIAP and NAIP BIR3 Proteins— Isolation of NAIP cDNAs and the construction of pGEX-NAIP-BIR3 and pGEX-XIAP-BIR3 have been described in detail elsewhere (4Maier J.K.

NAIP and XIAP glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged BIR3 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21-TrxB-DE3 (Novagen Inc.). Overnight bacterial cultures were diluted 1 in 10 in LB medium and incubated at room temperature. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.2 units, cells were induced for the production of the recombinant proteins with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after a 2-h induction. Cell paste was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and mixed at 4 °C for 15 min. After a gentle sonication, the mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sephadex 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated with buffer A for 1 h. The resin was washed with buffer A followed by buffer B (buffer A supplemented to 0.2 m NaCl and 10% glycerol). Recombinant NAIP and XIAP BIR3 proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentrations were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's protocol. The purity of the proteins was determined by SDS-PAGE and was generally greater than 95%. Construction of pcDNA3–6myc-NAIP Expression Plasmids—The coding region for full-length NAIP, B123-NOD, and the LRR regions of NAIP were amplified using the following primers: 5′-dGGATCCATGGCCACCCAGCAGAAAGCCT and 5′-dCTCGAGTACATCCTCAATATGCCCCA; 5′-dGGATCCATGGCCACCCAGCAGAAAGCCT and 5′-dCTCGAGTCCAGGAGTTCAATCAGCCTCAT; and 5′-dGGATCCGATTCAGATAGGCAGGAACAT and 5′-dCTCGAGTACATCCTCAATATGCCCCA, respectively. The amplified products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pcDNA3–6myc. The integrity of the constructs was determined by sequencing the entire coding region. pcDNA3–6myc is a modified version of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that contains six repeats of the myc epitope recognized by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody, followed by BamHI and XhoI sites. The construction of HA-tagged ubiquitin Smac is described elsewhere (26Hunter A.M. Kottachchi D. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Korneluk R.G. Liston P. J. Biol.

Transfection of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells (ATCC) were transfected when ∼60% confluent using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation of myc-tagged IAPs and Their Interaction with Caspase-9—HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3–6myc-IAPs or pcDNA3–6myc-LRR were lysed in buffer A containing leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, 1 μg of anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Twenty μl of 50% protein A-agarose was added and incubated for another 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and were immediately used for caspase-9 interaction studies as follows. Fifty units of active truncated caspase-9 (20 + 12-kDa subunits, Biomol Research Laboratories) were incubated with immunoprecipitated samples for 3 h at 4 °C and washed. The samples were analyzed by Western blot using anticaspase-9 antibody (Biomol Research Laboratories). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Primers 5′-dGAAGCTGGAAGTGGAACGACGGTCCTCCTGAAG and 5′-dCTTCAGGAGGACCGTCGTTCCACTTCCAGCTTC-3′ were employed to mutate lysine 476 to threonine using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutant construct was sequenced using both strands as templates. Size Exclusion Chromatography—pcDNA3–6myc-NAIP-transfected HeLa cells were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% CHAPS buffer, lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with the same buffer. To study the effect of dATP or ATP on the size of NAIP, the supernatant was incubated with 1 mm dATP or ATP for 10 min on ice and subsequently loaded onto the column. Chromatography was carried out at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at 4 °C using an ÄKTA Explorer 900 system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by Western blot using anti-myc 9E10 antibody (Sigma). Caspase-9 Inhibition Assay—Caspase-9 assays were performed in 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10% polyethylene glycol, 0.1% CHAPS, and 10 mm dithiothreitol using 100 units of caspase-9 and 2 mm Ac-LEHD-pNA as a substrate. The hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored at 405 nm at 30 °C for 60–90 min. The inhibitory constants were obtained using a range of inhibitor concentrations while maintaining constant levels of both the substrate and enzyme. To study the effect of AVPFVASLPN peptide (AVPF-peptide) on reversing the inhibition of caspase-9 by the BIR3 domains of NAIP and XIAP, BIR3 proteins were incubated with the final concentration of 30 μm AVPF-peptide prior to incubation with caspase-9. NAIP Interaction with Caspase-9 Is ATP-dependent—Previous experiments have established that the BIR domains of NAIP can inhibit caspase-3 and -7. Functional domain-mapping experiments established that NAIP BIR2 potently inhibited caspase-3 to a degree equivalent to full-length XIAP (Ki = 10 ± 6nm and Ki = 16 ± 6nm, respectively; Ref. 4Maier J.K. Lahoua Z. Gendron N.H. Fetni R. Johnston A. Davoodi J. Rasper D. Roy S. Slack R.S. Nicholson D.W. MacKenzie A.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2035-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, NAIP BIR3 displayed significantly poorer inhibition (Ki = 185 ± 15 nm) yet provided significantly better cytoprotection in cell survival assays, suggesting additional, as yet uncharacterized activities for BIR3. Furthermore, these experiments utilized recombinant proteins consisting of isolated BIR domains and thus did not assess BIR domain function in the context of the full-length protein. Given the known interaction of XIAP BIR3 with caspase-9 (14Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether NAIP also binds caspase-9. We used epitope-tagged recombinant proteins expressed and immunoprecipitated from tissue culture cells as a source of NAIP or XIAP and examined their ability to interact with purified active caspase-9. This approach was also used to determine what effect, if any, the NAIP NODs and LRR domains had on this interaction. Caspase-9 interaction with NAIP was examined by Western blot analysis of affinity-purified 6myc-NAIP using anticaspase-9 antibody (Fig. 2B) with 6myc-XIAP used as a positive control. Transfection efficiency was monitored by Western blot of whole cell lysate using anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). As seen in Fig. 2B, second and third lanes, NAIP did not interact with caspase-9 under conditions that allowed XIAP to bind. However, the addition of ATP to the reaction mixture resulted in a NAIP-caspase-9 interaction (Fig. 2B, fourth lane), suggesting that NAIP undergoes an ATP-dependent conformational change necessary for the interaction to occur. Previous studies have shown that lysine to threonine mutations within the ATP binding site render NOD proteins constitutively active. Thus to further investigate the ATP dependence of NAIP, lysine 476 in the putative nucleotide binding site was mutated to threonine. Interestingly, NAIP caspase-9 interaction was then observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2B, fifth lane). We therefore conclude that the caspase-9-NAIP interaction has a structural requirement for ATP, rather than an energetic one requiring ATP hydrolysis. Finally, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal LRR domain in the BIR123-NOD construct eliminates the requirement for ATP (Fig. 2B, sixth lane), as does the deletion of both the NOD and the LRR domain (Fig. 2B, BIR123xt (seventh lane)). Taken together, these results suggest that the LRR region in some way sequesters the BIR domains of NAIP, a sequestration which is reversed by ATP binding. NAIP BIR3 Inhibits Caspase-9—Having established that the NAIP BIR domains can bind caspase-9, we next sought to determine the functional consequences of this interaction on caspase-9 enzymatic activity. Previous reports have established that the BIR3 domains of the three BIR-containing IAPs (XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2) specifically bind and inhibit caspase-9. We therefore expressed and purified a GST-NAIP BIR3 fusion protein from E. coli. GST-XIAP BIR3 was expressed and purified for use as a positive control. Chromogenic assays using a caspase-9 peptide substrate revealed that both XIAP BIR3 and NAIP BIR3 proteins function as potent inhibitors of caspase-9 (Fig. 2C), with IC50 values of 17 and 33 nm, respectively. We also sought to confirm caspase-9 inhibition by full-length NAIP. However, we could not address this issue because the full-length NAIP is extensively degraded when expressed either in E. coli or in eukaryotic cells using the recombinant adeno-NAIP virus. NAIP Exists as a Tetramer in Both the Presence and Absence of ATP—NOD-mediated homo-oligomerization has been reported previously (27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

To investigate potential changes in the higher order structure of NAIP in the presence or absence of ATP, we performed size exclusion chromatography. NAIP was observed to migrate at a molecular mass of ∼680 kDa (Fig. 3), roughly equivalent to four subunits of the 160-kDa NAIP monomer. Immunoprecipitation analysis of NAIP with [35S]methionine-labeled cell extract did not reveal the presence of additional protein species within this complex (data not shown). We therefore concluded that NAIP exists as a tetramer. Surprisingly, a similar migration pattern was observed for the wild type protein in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3) or dATP as well as for the constitutively active K476T mutant (data not shown). We therefore propose that ATP binding facilitates the interaction of caspase-9 and NAIP through a change in the conformation of NAIP but not through a change in its quaternary structure. NAIP Is Not Cleaved by Caspase-9—Our results indicate that the LRR domain of NAIP functionally sequesters the BIR domains and maintains NAIP in a latent state. Caspase processing of c-IAP1 and XIAP has been reported previously (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 30Clem R.J. Sheu T.T. Richter B.W. He W.W. Thornberry N.A. Duckett C.S. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). XIAP cleavage between BIR2 and BIR3 was originally proposed to liberate the two functional halves of the protein, with BIR1-2 free to inhibit caspase-3 or -7 and the BIR3-RING fragment free to inhibit caspase-9. Because we observed that truncated NAIPs lacking the LRR domain and/or NOD were constitutively active with respect to caspase binding, we sought to determine whether NAIP undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage in vivo. HeLa cells were co-transfected with NAIP or XIAP expression vectors and a plasmid encoding caspase-9. Western blot analysis with anti-myc antibody demonstrated that approximately half of the expressed XIAP was cleaved to a size consistent with the reported processing between BIR2 and BIR3. This processing was caspase-9-dependent as no processing was observed in the absence of caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, no evidence of NAIP processing was observed, either with the wild type protein or with the “activated” forms bearing the NOD point mutation or the truncation of the LRR domain and the NOD (Fig. 4). The absence of NAIP cleavage under conditions in which XIAP is proteolytically processed favors our contention that an ATP-dependent conformational change in NAIP, rather than its cleavage, enables NAIP to bind caspase-9. NAIP Does Not Interact with Smac—Both NAIP and XIAP bind and inhibit caspase-9, yet there are significant amino acid differences in their respective BIR3 binding pockets (Fig. 1). This binding pocket is believed to bind the amino terminus of the small subunit of caspase-9 following autocatalytic cleavage at Asp315. This processing event exposes a tetrapeptide sequence termed an IAP binding motif, which has also been identified in several Drosophila and mammalian proapoptotic proteins. IBM-containing proteins are believed to mediate their proapoptotic function, at least in part, by competing for interaction with the IAPs, thus displacing bound caspases, which are then free to continue amplifying the caspase cascade (for review, see Ref. 31Liston P. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8568-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To determine whether NAIP is capable of interacting with IBM-containing proteins, HeLa cells were co-transfected with NAIP or XIAP expression vectors and a plasmid that expresses mature cytosolic Smac-HA protein lacking the mitochondrial leader peptide (26Hunter A.M. Kottachchi D. Lewis J. Duckett C.S. Korneluk R.G. Liston P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7494-7499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). myc-tagged NAIPs and XIAPs were immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody for the detection of Smac (Fig. 5A). Although XIAP bound the Smac protein, wild type NAIP did not interact with Smac. Furthermore, the presence of ATP, which triggers NAIP-caspase-9 interaction, did not induce binding. The constitutively active forms of NAIP also failed to bind Smac (Fig. 5A). To substantiate these findings, we assessed whether an AVPF-initiating peptide would reverse caspase-9 inhibition by NAIP BIR3. As expected, a 30-micromolar excess of the AVPF-peptide almost fully restored caspase-9 activity when XIAP BIR3 was employed as an inhibitor (Fig. 5C). In contrast, no discernible effect on NAIP BIR3-mediated inhibition of caspase-9 was observed (Fig. 5B). These observations support our contention that NAIP is unique among the IAPs in both its activation mechanism and its failure to be inhibited by IBM-containing proteins such as Smac. NAIP, the founding member of the mammalian IAPs, is a 160-kDa protein with three distinct regions: an amino-terminal cluster of three BIR domains, a central NOD, and a carboxyl-terminal LRR domain. These regions consist of ∼350, 300, and 640 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). In this respect NAIP is a much larger protein than the other known IAPs, the largest of which is less than 70 kDa. In fact, classification of NAIP as an IAP is based entirely on the conservation of the BIR domains, whereas the overall organization of the protein suggests membership in the NOD family of proteins with diverse physiological functions (24Inohara N. Nunez G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6473-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Chamaillard M. Girardin S.E. Viala J. Philpott D.J. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic function of full-length NAIP has been documented in a number of tissue culture and animal model systems (2Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G.

Since MGP is an insoluble matrix protein, this work has focused on intracellular processing and transport of MGP to become an extracellular binding protein for bone morphogenetic protein-2.

Formation of bone outside the skeleton (ectopic calcification) has been recognized for >100 years, but we still have no clear picture of the events that lead to this pathological condition and the mechanism(s) that opposes onset of the pathology (1Demer L.L. Tintut Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, findings in mice deleted of the gene for a 14-kDa vitamin K-dependent protein, matrix γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; MGP, matrix Gla protein; BMP-2, bone morphogenetic protein-2; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; Gla-MGP, fully γ-carboxylated MGP; Glu-MGP, non-γ-carboxylated or incompletely γ-carboxylated MGP that cannot attain the secondary structure of fully γ-carboxylated MGP in the presence of Ca2+; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. protein (MGP), have provided new insight into the protective mechanism (2Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the MGP gene develop severe calcification of arteries and cartilage, suggesting that MGP is an important inhibitor of ectopic calcification. This function of MGP has been shown to be dependent upon the vitamin K modification of the protein, a modification that converts Glu residues in the protein to Gla calcium-binding residues (3Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been launched about mechanisms by which MGP may work as a calcification inhibitor (1Demer L.L. Tintut Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We demonstrated by ligand blotting that a binding interaction exists between MGP and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a potent growth factor (5Wozney J.M. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar) that transforms undifferentiated cells and subpopulations of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into bone-forming cells (6Bostom K.

In support of this finding are 1) the demonstration by Zebboudj et al. (9Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) of a complex between MGP and BMP-2 in cell culture medium from MGP- and BMP-2-producing cells and 2) observations that the activities of growth factors are often regulated by specific binding proteins through formation of protein complexes (10Annes J.P. Chen Y. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Complexes between BMP-2 and its soluble binding protein noggin are known to be formed (11Zimmerman L.B. DeJesus-Escobar J.M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 599-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MGP is extremely insoluble in physiological solutions (12Hauschka P.V. Lian J.B. Cole D.E.C. Gundberg C.M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69 (D. E. C.): 990-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), which poses the question of whether soluble complexes between MGP and BMP-2 are being formed. All precursors of vitamin K-dependent proteins are equipped with a propeptide that is the site recognized by the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase for post-translational γ-carboxylation of the precursors (13Furie B. Furie B.C. Blood. 1990; 75: 1753-1762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal propeptide is normally released in the trans-Golgi apparatus before the precursors become mature proteins (14Stanton C. Taylor R. Wallin R. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MGP is unique among the members of the vitamin K-dependent protein family by having the propeptide as part of the mature protein sequence (15Price P.A. Fraser J.D. Metz-Virca G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8335-8339Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is possible that this unusual design of the protein gives MGP properties that are not shared by the other members of the vitamin K-dependent protein family, which include poor solubility of MGP. The unique properties of MGP have hindered an understanding of the intracellular processing and intracellular transport of MGP to become an extracellular binding protein for BMP-2. A main goal of this work has been to understand the intracellular processing and intracellular transport of MGP. In contrast to MGP, the intracellular processing and intracellular transport of BMP-2 have been studied extensively. BMP-2 is synthesized as a 60-kDa precursor that is processed in the secretory pathway to a small 18-kDa monomer. Two monomers associate to form the active homodimer of the growth factor (16Israel D.I. Nove J. Kerns K.M. Moutsatsos I.K. Kaufman R.J. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast to processing of BMP-2, processing of MGP includes its post-translational vitamin K-dependent modification step in the endoplasmic reticulum. If the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation system is inhibited by coumarin anticoagulant drugs (17Suttie J.W. Deluca H.F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar) or the cell is deficient in vitamin K (17Suttie J.W. Deluca H.F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar), MGP may escape this modification step, and a non-γ-carboxylated form of MGP is produced (17Suttie J.W. Deluca H.F. Handbook of Lipid Research. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978: 211-277Google Scholar). The physical properties of fully γ-carboxylated MGP (Gla-MGP) are quite different from those of non-γ-carboxylated MGP (Glu-MGP) in that Gla-MGP undergoes a conformational change upon Ca2+ binding (18Simon J.P. Ivanov I.E. Shopsin B. Hersh D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16952-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have shown that this conformational change is necessary for formation of the MGP·BMP-2 complex (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 176-185Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and Price et al. (20Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have shown that the fully γ-carboxylated protein, but not the non-γ-carboxylated protein, is carried in plasma by fetuin, suggesting that the vitamin K modification of MGP is also essential for fetuin binding. Furthermore, the majority of MGP proteins produced in calcified lesions in the arterial wall appear as non-γ-carboxylated proteins that are inactive as binding proteins for BMP-2 (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), a finding that may reflect the inability of MGP to neutralize the growth factor activity of BMP-2 at the site of pathology. The processing and transport of the non-γ-carboxylated form of MGP are also poorly understood. Therefore, to understand the MGP/BMP-2 system as a regulatory system of ectopic calcification, it is imperative that we understand the cellular processing and transport of both forms of MGP. VSMCs are believed to be the source of the MGP/BMP-2 system in the arterial wall (1Demer L.L. Tintut Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Zebboudj A.F. Imura M. Bostrom K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4388-4394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis is the recent demonstration in transgenic mice that Gla-MGP produced in the vessel wall, and not systemic MGP, inhibits arterial calcification (21Murshed M. Schinke T. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To study the cellular processing and transport of Gla-MGP and Glu-MGP, we have used in this work a primary culture of human VSMCs infected with an adenovirus carrying the MGP construct. Overproduction of MGP by the infected cells exceeded the capacity of the γ-carboxylation system, and the cells produced a mixture of Gla-MGP and Glu-MGP, allowing us to follow both forms of MGP in the cell. Both forms of MGP, but not BMP-2, were found in the cytosolic fraction obtained by subcellular fractionation of the cell homogenate. However, an additional, more acidic form of MGP was found in the microsomal fraction. This additional form of MGP was identified as the phosphoserine-modified form of MGP (22Price P.A. Rice J.S. Williamson M.K. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fetuin was identified in both the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. An endocytotic mechanism for fetuin uptake by the cultured VSMCs is demonstrated. Furthermore, fetuin is shown to harbor one or more epitopes that are recognized by anti-MGP antibodies. This finding raises concerns about antibody-based assays used to quantify MGP in serum and tissue extracts. Preparation of an Adenovirus-MGP Construct—Adenovirus carrying the coding cDNA of human MGP (adenovirus-MGP) was constructed by site-specific bacterial transposition using the Transpose-Ad adenoviral system (QBIOgene, Montreal, Canada). The coding region of the human MGP cDNA (nucleotides 13–349, GenBank™/EBI accession number M58549) was obtained by PCR amplification of plasmid HTM1-296 from a human trabecular meshwork library (23Gonzalez P. Epstein D.L. Borras T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3678-3693PubMed Google Scholar) using high proof Taq polymerase and primers 5′-TGCAGGACGAAACCATGAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCCCTCAGTCTCATTTGGC-3′ (reverse). These primers were designed to contain KpnI and XbaI sites at their 5′-ends, respectively. The amplified insert was digested with KpnI/XbaI, purified, and cloned into a KpnI/XbaI-predigested pCR259 transfer vector (pWX1, QBIOgene) under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer. Upon sequencing confirmation, pWX1 was transfected into Transpose-Ad294-competent Escherichia coli cells and then transposed into the Ad294 plasmid, disrupting the lacZ gene. High titer viral stocks were obtained by propagation in 293 cells and purification by CsCl density centrifugation as described (24Borras T. Tamm E.R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1282-1293PubMed Google Scholar, 25Borras T. Rowlette L.L. Erzurum S.C. Epstein D.L. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) Purified viruses were titered by spectrophotometric reading at A260 and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. The absence of contaminant wild-type viruses was tested in each stock by PCR amplification with E1A-specific primers 5′-TCGAAGAGGTACTGGCTGAT-3′ and 5′-TGACAAGACCTGCAACCGTG-3′. Infection of VSMCs with the Adenovirus-MGP Construct—Human VSMCs (cc2571, Cambrex, Boston, MA) were cultured in SmGM-2 (Cambrex). At 70% confluency, cells were infected with the adenovirus-MGP construct (multiplicity of infection of 20) and harvested 48 h after infection. All cultures contained 10 μg of vitamin K1 (Sigma)/ml of medium. For collection of proteins secreted from the cells, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured for an additional 16 h in serum-free SmBM (basal medium; catalog no. CC-3177; Cambrex). Proteins in the serum-free medium were concentrated in a Centritrap concentrator with a 3.5-kDa cutoff. Biotin Labeling of Fetuin—Ten mg of fetuin (molecular biology grade) was dissolved in 1 ml of PBS. A 20-fold molar excess of EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidobiotin was added to the fetuin solution, and the mixture was reacted for 30 min at room temperature in the dark on a rotating shaker. The reaction mixture was gel-filtrated on Sephadex G-25 in PBS, and the void volume fraction containing biotin-conjugated fetuin was collected. The biotin-conjugated fetuin was dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C and sterile-filtrated before added to the cell culture medium. Immunohistochemistry—VSMCs cultured in SmGM-2 were depleted of endogenous fetuin by incubating the cells for 15 min at 37 °C in serum-free SmBM as described by Lorenzo et al. (26Lorenzo H.C. Geuskens M. Macho M. Lachkar S. Verdiere-Sahugue M. Pineiro A. Uriel J. Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 252-260Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fetuin binding to the VSMC membrane was investigated by incubating depleted cells with biotin-labeled fetuin (50 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 30 min at 4 °C (26Lorenzo H.C. Geuskens M. Macho M. Lachkar S. Verdiere-Sahugue M. Pineiro A. Uriel J. Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 252-260Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. For competition studies, depleted cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in serum-free medium containing a 100-fold excess of unlabeled fetuin over biotin-labeled fetuin. For uptake studies, cells incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 5 μg/ml biotin-labeled fetuin were exposed to serum-free medium at 37 °C for an additional 30 min before being fixed in paraformaldehyde (26Lorenzo H.C. Geuskens M. Macho M. Lachkar S. Verdiere-Sahugue M. Pineiro A. Uriel J. Tumor Biol. 1996; 17: 252-260Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For fluorescent staining, fixed cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with biotin-specific monoclonal antibodies (1:100 dilution), followed by incubation with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Rhodamine epifluorescence images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskop equipped with a digital camera and Axovision imaging software. Final images were processed using Adobe Photoshop Version 7.0.1. Images of rhodamine epifluorescence were also obtained by confocal microscopy. A Zeiss Model 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a ×40 water immersion objective was used. The optical slice thickness was 2.1 μm for each image. Cell Disruption and Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed with cold PBS, and the cell lysate was prepared using modified radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (1 μg/ml each) as recommended by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described previously (27Wallin R. Cain D. Sane D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 84: 1764-1767Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were washed with cold PBS and disrupted by sonication in isotonic buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, 250 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture for use with mammalian cells and tissues, 5 μg/ml orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml NaF, pH 7.5. Cell disruption was carried out on ice in a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator (Model 100) at setting 4. Twenty pulses of 2-s duration were used. The protein concentration was 8 mg/ml. The sonicate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. A microsomal pellet was obtained by subjecting the supernatant to centrifugation at 229,000 × g for 60 min in a Ti-70.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The microsomal pellet and the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) were stored frozen at -85 °C until used in the experiments. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Prior to SDS-PAGE, proteins in cell microsomes were dissolved in 250 mm phosphate, 0.5 m KCl, 20% glycerol, and 0.75% CHAPS, pH 7.85, containing 10 μl/ml Sigma protease inhibitor mixture and subsequently precipitated with cold acetone (-20 °C) by mixing 1 part protein solution with 5 parts acetone. Cytosolic proteins and cell proteins extracted with RIPA buffer were also precipitated with acetone as described above. The mixtures were left overnight at -20 °C, and precipitated proteins were harvested by centrifugation. The precipitated proteins were washed consecutively with 5 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (4 °C) and 5 ml (v/v) of ice-cold ether/ethanol (-20 °C). The protein pellets from the ether/ethanol washes were dried by N2 aspiration. For two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the dried proteins were dissolved in 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% pH 3–10 ampholyte and absorbed onto Bio-Rad pH 3–10 gradient strips overnight according to the instruction manual for the Protean isoelectric focusing cell (BioRad). SDS-PAGE in the second dimension was carried out on Criterion 8–16% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) also according to the Bio-Rad instruction manual. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was carried out on Criterion 8–16% gradient gels by dissolving the dried cell proteins in SDS-PAGE running buffer containing 5% mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Western blotting was carried out as described (28Wajih N. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M Wallin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25276-25283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) after transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoprecipitation—Affinity-purified polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies were added to cell extracts in RIPA buffer and left overnight at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Immune complexes were captured with protein A-Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech) and washed on a magnetic rack as described in the instruction manual for Dynabeads. Proteins were released from the beads with 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% pH 3–10 ampholyte and absorbed onto Bio-Rad pH 3–10 isoelectric focusing gradient strips overnight. For one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, proteins were released from the beads by boiling the beads in SDS-PAGE running buffer containing 5% mercaptoethanol. Assays—γ-Carboxylase activity was assayed as described for VSMCs (27Wallin R. Cain D. Sane D.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 84: 1764-1767Google Scholar) as 14CO2 incorporation into the synthetic peptide FLEEL. The reaction was triggered by adding chemically reduced vitamin K1H2 (100 μg/ml) to the assay mixture. Mass Spectrometry—In-gel digestion of Coomassie Blue-stained proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was carried out with trypsin, and sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA) by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC/nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP quadrupole ion trap spectrometer. Materials—The anti-MGP N-terminal peptide antibodies were raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide covering residues 6–37 of the human MGP sequence (19Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 176-185Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These antibodies recognize MGP independently of the γ-carboxylation status of the MGP protein (19Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 176-185Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The anti-Glu-MGP and anti-Gla-MGP antibodies were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides covering the Gla region of MGP. Synthesis of these peptides, antibody production, and purification of conformation-specific antibodies against the Gla region of MGP have been described (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The anti-Glu-MGP and anti-Gla-MGP antibodies recognize the non-γ-carboxylated and fully γ-carboxylated forms of MGP, respectively (19Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 176-185Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Goat anti-human BMP-2 polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All of the anti-MGP peptide antibodies prepared by our laboratory and also the anti-BMP-2 antibodies (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified by our laboratory and stored frozen at -85 °C in 50% glycerol/water as described (4Wallin R. Cain D. Hutson S.M. Sane D. Loeser R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2000; 84: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Sweatt A. Sane D.C. Hutson S.M. Wallin R. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 176-185Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody made against human MGP epitope 3–15 (N-terminal residues 3–15 of the human MGP sequence) was purchased from VitaK Inc. (University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-phosphoserine polyclonal antibodies (Poly-Z-PS1) were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Mouse anti-biotin, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), and TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Mouse anti-human Golgi apparatus monoclonal antibodies (clone AE-6) were from Calbiochem. Anti-bovine fetuin polyclonal antibodies (IgG fraction) were from Acris (Hiddenhausen, Germany). These antibodies were affinity-purified on a bovine fetuin-Sepharose affinity resin prepared by our laboratory and stored frozen at -85 °C in 50% glycerol/water. Bovine fetuin (molecular biology grade) was from USBiological (Swampscott, MA). A2-hs-glycoprotein from human plasma and fetuin from fetal calf serum were from Sigma. EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate was from Pierce. Centriprep 3000 NMWL centrifugal filter units were from Millipore Corp. All other chemicals were chemical grade or better. Adenovirus-MGP Infection of VSMCs—VSMCs infected with the adenovirus-MGP construct resulted in overexpression of MGP. Fig. 1 shows Western blots with the anti-MGP N-terminal peptide antibodies of proteins present in a RIPA buffer extract (RIPA Ext.) of control cells (Cont.) and infected cells (Ad-MGP) and in the pellets of cell debris left over after RIPA buffer extraction (PELLET) of control and infected cells. A 14-kDa protein recognized by the antibodies appeared both in the RIPA buffer extract of infected cells (lane B) and in the proteins in the infected cells that were not soluble in RIPA buffer (lane D). An immune reaction with a 60-kDa protein was also seen. VSMCs are known to synthesize MGP (29Shanahan C.M. Nathaniel R.B. Salisbury J.R. Proudfoot D. Weissberg P.L. Edmonds M.E. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2168-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). We could detect MGP in the control cells when a longer exposure time was used for imaging Western blots for chemiluminescence (data not shown). Searching for an Intracellular MGP Carrier Protein(s) or Precursor—The unique properties of MGP and the poor solubility of the protein prompted a search for the cellular mechanism(s) by which MGP is transported intracellularly and released from the cell. Initially, we considered two possible mechanisms. 1) Although the mRNA for MGP does predict translation of a protein <23 kDa (20Price P.A. Nguyen T.M.T. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22153-22160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), we did not exclude the possibility that a larger soluble precursor of MGP could be made and processed to a smaller protein before secretion from the cell; and 2) MGP could be carried through the cell attached to a carrier protein to assure solubility of MGP. VSMCs infected with the adenovirus-MGP construct were extracted with RIPA buffer, and the extracted proteins were separated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Proteins on identical two-dimensional gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting with the anti-MGP N-terminal peptide antibodies (Fig. 2B) and the anti-BMP-2 antibodies (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2B, the anti-MGP N-terminal peptide antibodies recognized a 60-kDa protein spot (MGP like protein, 60 kDa), several proteins of intermediate size, the basic 14-kDa non-γ-carboxylated form of MGP (Glu-MGP), and the more acidic fully γ-carboxylated form (Gla-MGP). The positions of Glu-MGP and Gla-MGP on the two-dimensional gel were determined by Western blotting with the anti-Glu-MGP and anti-Gla-MGP peptide antibodies, respectively (data not shown). Fig. 2C shows the Western blot obtained with the anti-BMP-2 antibodies. Consistent with the known processing events of BMP-2 (16Israel D.I. Nove J. Kerns K.M. Moutsatsos I.K. Kaufman R.J. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), several immunoreactive proteins were identified in the RIPA buffer extract along with the basic 18-kDa monomer of the growth factor. These data show that MGP and BMP-2 were produced by the cultured human VSMCs. Identification of the 60-kDa MGP-like Protein—The Coomassie Blue-stained protein spot labeled MGP like protein, 60 kDa in Fig. 2A was excised from the two-dimensional gel and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and peptides were analyzed by MS/MS for protein identification. The identities of five proteins present in the excised spot are shown in Table I. No tryptic peptides from the MGP sequence could be identified. This negative finding strongly suggested that none of the proteins identified in the Coomassie Blue-stained MGP like protein,60 kDa spot could be a MGP precursor or a protein"
https://openalex.org/W2046741089,"The oligomeric structure of ABCA1 transporter and its function related to the biogenesis of nascent apoA-I-containing particles (LpA-I) were investigated. Using n-dodecylmaltoside and perfluoro-octanoic acid combined with non-denaturing gel, the majority of ABCA1 was found as a tetramer in ABCA1-induced human fibroblasts. Furthermore, using chemical cross-linking and SDS-PAGE, ABCA1 dimers but not the tetramers were found covalently linked. Oligomeric ABCA1 was present in isolated plasma membranes as well as in intracellular compartments. Interestingly, apoA-I was found to be associated with both dimeric and tetrameric, but not monomeric, forms of ABCA1. Neither apoA-I nor lipid molecules did affect ABCA1 oligomerization. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that oligomeric ABCA1 did not contain other associated proteins. We next investigated the relationship between the oligomeric ABCA1 complex and the structure of LpA-I. Lipid-free apoA-I incubated with normal cells generated LpA-I with diameters between 9.5 and 20 nm. Subsequent isolation of LpA-I followed by cross-linking revealed the presence of four and eight apoA-I molecules per particle, whereas apoA-I incubated with ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells was unable to form such particles and remained in the monomeric form. These results demonstrate that: 1) ABCA1 exists as an oligomeric complex; and 2) ABCA1 oligomerization was independent of apoA-I binding and lipid molecules. The findings that the majority of ABCA1 exists as a tetramer that binds apoA-I, together with the observation that LpA-I contains at least four molecules of apoA-I per particle, support the concept that the homotetrameric ABCA1 complex constitutes the minimum functional unit required for the biogenesis of high density lipoprotein particles.

Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ABC transporters have been associated with many diseases such as drug-resistant cancer (2Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), diabetes (3Thomas P.M. Cote G.J. Wohllk N. Haddad B. Mathew P.M. Rabl W. Aguilar-Bryan L. Gagel R.F.

Apolipoprotein (apo) A-I binding to the extracellular domain of ABCA1 results in the activation of apoA-I lipidation, a key step in the reverse cholesterol transport process, one of the major mechanisms by which high density lipoprotein (HDL) may protect against atherosclerotic vascular disease (5Tall A.R.

The molecular interaction of apoA-I with ABCA1 promotes cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from peripheral cells and macrophages. However, Brewer and colleagues (8Basso F. Freeman L. Knapper C.L. Remaley A. Stonik J. Neufeld E.B. Tansey T. Amar M.J. Fruchart-Najib J. Duverger N. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J.

Moreover, the importance of ABCA1 in the lipidation of apoA-I is highlighted by the finding that over 50 mutations in the ABCA1 gene have been associated with a variety of clinically distinct HDL deficiency diseases including Tangier disease and familial HDL deficiency (9Singaraja R.R.

These patients are characterized by excess cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, low plasma HDL levels, and increased risk of coronary artery atherosclerosis (12Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ABC transporters typically consist of two multispanning membrane domains that serve as a pathway for the translocation of substrates across membranes and two ATP binding cassettes or nucleotide binding domains that provide the energy for substrate transport (13Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Smit L.S. Wilkinson D.J. Mansoura M.K. Collins F.S. Dawson D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9963-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These domains are found either on a single long polypeptide chain, as in the case of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the multidrug resistance proteins, P-glycoprotein and MRP1, or as a complex of two identical or similar “half-molecule” subunits each having an multispanning membrane domain and an nucleotide binding domain, as found in the TAP1/TAP2 ABC transporters associated with peptide antigen processing. ABCA1 belongs to the first category because it consists of a single polypeptide composed of two arranged halves. Each half contains an multispanning membrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain. A distinguishing feature of ABCA1 is the presence of a large exocytoplasmic domain that connects the first transmembrane segment to the multispanning membrane domain in each half of the protein (15Becq F. Hamon Y. Bajetto A. Gola M. Verrier B. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2695-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the ABCA1 molecule is well characterized, very little is known concerning its quaternary structure and its functional properties related to the formation of nascent apoA-I-containing particles. To date, no studies have directly assessed the multimeric structure of human ABCA1. It was therefore the aim of the present study to provide evidence for the existence of oligomeric ABCA1 complex, to demonstrate how ABCA1 forms could be affected by apoA-I or lipid molecules, and to examine the impact of the oligomeric ABCA1 complex on the structure of nascent apoA-I-containing particles in a cell culture model. Patient Selection—For the present study, we selected fibroblasts from three normal control subjects and one patient with Tangier disease (homozygous for Q597R at the ABCA1 gene). The protocol for the study was reviewed and accepted by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Centre. Separate consent forms for blood sampling, DNA isolation, and skin biopsy were provided. Cell Culture—Human skin fibroblasts were obtained from 3.0-mm punch biopsies of the forearm of patients and healthy control subjects and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.1% non-essential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ABCA1 expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were generously provided by Dr. Sean Davidson, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati, and were characterized and cultured as described previously (16Witting S.R. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40121-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Human Plasma ApoA-I and ApoE3—Purified plasma apoA-I (Biodesign) was resolubilized in 4 m guanidine-HCl and dialyzed extensively against PBS buffer and used within 24 h. ApoA-I was iodinated with 125I-labeled iodine by IODO-GEN® (Pierce) to a specific activity of 800–2500 cpm/ng of apoA-I. Purified human plasma apoE3 was a gift from Dr. Karl H. Weisgraber (Gladstone Institutes of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA). Solubilization of Cell Proteins by n-Dodecylmaltoside and Perfluorooctanoic Acid—Normal fibroblasts in 100-mm diameter dishes were stimulated with 2.5 μg/ml 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h. Cells were then lysed at 4 °C with PBS containing 0.5% n-dodecylmaltoside in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture followed by low speed centrifugation to remove insoluble materials. In separate experiments, cells were lysed with 0.8% perfluoro-octanoic acid as described by Ramjeesingh et al. (17Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.J. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10700-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After solubilization of cell proteins and centrifugation at 11,000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min, the supernatants were treated or not with 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the samples were separated by non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (3–15%) as described previously (18Krimbou L.

Chemical Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Chemical cross-linking was performed as described by Tall and colleagues (19Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in 100-mm diameter dishes and then stimulated or not with 2.5 μg/ml 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid for 20 h in DMEM/bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I in DMEM/bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then placed on ice for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP, cross-linker agent) was dissolved immediately before use in Me2SO and diluted to 500 μm in PBS. Six ml of DSP solution was added in each well. Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min; the medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. Cells were lysed at 4 °C with 20 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA; pH 7.5) containing 0.5% n-dodecylmaltoside, and the suspension was allowed to stand for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Either apoA-I/ABCA1 complex or ABCA1 alone was immunoprecipitated with an affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody (Novus Biologicals) as described previously (20Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M.

The presence of labeled 125I-apoA-I/ABCA1 complexes was directly detected by autoradiography by using XAR-2 Kodak film. Isolation of Nascent LpA-I Particles and Cross-linking with DSP—125I-apoA-I (10 μg/ml) was incubated in DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C with either stimulated normal or Q597R cells. LpA-I particles were isolated by using ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, MWCO 100,000, Amicon) to discard any lipid-free apoA-I. LpA-I particles were further dialyzed by using a dialysis membrane with a MWCO of 50,000 to remove any remaining lipid-free apoA-I. Cross-linking of isolated LpA-I was performed as described by Davidson and Hilliard (22Davidson W.S. Hilliard G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27199-27207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 15 μg of isolated LpA-I generated by normal cells, apoA-I incubated with Q597R cells, or lipid-free apoA-I incubated without cells was adjusted to 10 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with a final protein concentration of 1 μg/μl. Immediately before an experiment, 1 mg of DSP was dissolved in 1000 μl of Me2SO to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. The dissolved DSP was added to the reaction mixture for 10 DSP to 1 apoA-I molar ratio on ice. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with periodic vortexing. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 m Tris, pH 7.8, to a final Tris concentration of 100 mm. To rule out the possibility that cross-linking conditions might affect the number of apoA-I molecules per particle, the molar ratio of DSP to apoA-I was varied from 5/1 to 20/1, and incubations were conducted at different temperatures (4 °C, 37 °C, and room temperature). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation was performed as described previously (23Haidar B. Denis M. Marcil M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9963-9969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Confluent cells were stimulated and then cross-linked with DSP as described above. Surface proteins were biotinylated with 500 μg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimydyl-S,S-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with ice-cold quench buffer (1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and twice with ice-cold PBS. The cells were lysed at 4 °C with 20 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% n-dodecylmaltoside in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture and then homogenized with 40 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 1000 × g, 4 °C, for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei, 200 μg of protein from the supernatant was added to 30 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated overnight on a platform mixer at 4 °C. The beads was pelleted and washed three times with lysis buffer. Cross-linking, SDS-PAGE, and detection of ABCA1 were performed as described above. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of ABCA1—Metabolic labeling of ABCA1 was performed as described by Wang and Oram (24Wang Y. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5692-5697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, either stimulated or unstimulated normal cells were labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h. Cells were then lysed at 4 °C with lysis buffer containing 0.5% n-dodecylmaltoside in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture followed by low speed centrifugation to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ABCA1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated on 4–22.5% SDS-PAGE, and 35S-labeled ABCA1 was directly detected by autoradiography. Separation of Lipoproteins by Two-dimensional Non-denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PAGGE)—ApoA-I-containing particles were separated by two-dimensional-PAGGE, as described previously (18Krimbou L. Marcil M. Davignon J. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33241-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (30–100 μl) were separated in the first dimension (according to their charge) by 0.75% agarose gel electrophoresis (100 V, 3 h, 4 °C) and in the second dimension (according to the size) by 5–23% polyacrylamide concave gradient gel electrophoresis (125 V, 24 h, 4 °C). Iodinated high molecular weight protein mixture (7.1–17.0 nm, Amersham Biosciences) was run as a standard on each gel. Electrophoretically separated samples were electrotransferred (30 V, 24 h, 4 °C) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). 125I-apoA-I was directly detected by autoradiography by using XAR-2 Kodak film. In the present study, we have examined the multimeric status of human ABCA1 transporter in normal intact fibroblasts stimulated with 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid (22OH/9CRA) by using both n-dodecylmaltoside and perfluoro-octanoic acid combined with non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. These detergents at appropriate concentrations do not break the non-covalent interactions between protein subunits of an oligomer allowing determination of the oligomeric structure of ABCA1 complex. As shown in Fig. 1A, detection of ABCA1 by anti-ABCA1 antibody, after separation of total cell lysate solubilized by a non-ionic detergent n-dodecylmaltoside (0.5%) on non-denaturing gel (3–15%), revealed both a major and minor bands. The major band migrated as an ∼950-kDa complex, consistent with the molecular mass of tetramers. The minor band migrated as a larger complex, possibly an oligomer higher than tetramer, whereas the band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼550 kDa is likely a dimer. On the other hand, using DTT as a reducing agent, we observed that all the oligomeric forms were reduced to the monomeric form with a molecular mass of ∼250 kDa reported for complex glycosylated ABCA1 protein as estimated by using SDS-PAGE (21Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar results were also observed with a mild ionic detergent perfluoro-octanoic acid (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the oligomeric ABCA1 observed was not due to the use of a specific detergent. Interestingly, we did not detect any ABCA1 with the size of a monomer on non-denaturing gel in the absence of DTT. To determine further whether the oligomeric ABCA1 complex exists in living cells, chemical cross-linking was performed as described by Tall and colleagues (19Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, using SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, ABCA1 migrated at either the monomeric or dimeric molecular masses (∼250 and ∼500 kDa, respectively), whereas the monomer was predominant in the presence of DTT, indicative of disulfide bond contribution in dimer formation. On the other hand, a chemical cross-linker, DSP, was applied to the surface of intact normal fibroblasts to assess the quaternary structure of ABCA1. We found that immunoreactive ABCA1 in cells treated with DSP migrated primarily as a monomer (∼250 kDa), as dimers (∼500 KDa), or as a larger complex with a mass greater than that predicted for either a monomer or a dimer (Fig. 2B). This larger band is likely a tetramer. DTT reduced all the oligomeric forms to the monomeric ABCA1. To assess further the subcellular distribution of oligomeric ABCA1, we employed surface biotinylation to isolate ABCA1 associated with plasma membrane. Cross-linking of intact normal stimulated fibroblasts followed by biotinylation and detection of ABCA1 on SDS-PAGE showed three bands associated with plasma membrane, corresponding to monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric ABCA1 (Fig. 2C, left panel). The three ABCA1 forms were also detected in the intracellular compartments (Fig. 2C, right panel). Having determined that oligomeric ABCA1 complex was present in normal human fibroblasts treated with 22OH/9CRA, the question was posed whether ABCA1 induction in fibroblasts may cause self-association events that are non-physiological. We next examined the presence of oligomeric ABCA1 complex in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human ABCA1. We found that the monomeric and dimeric ABCA1 forms were present on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, whereas tetrameric ABCA1 was detected in the presence of the cross-linker reagent (DSP) (data not shown). To verify that the oligomerization of ABCA1 is not due to oxidation during cell lysis and membrane preparation, 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid was used as an agent that inhibited disulfide bond formation and the dimerization (25Krimbou L. Tremblay M. Jacques H. Davignon J. Cohn J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the absence or presence of 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid did not prevent the dimerization of ABCA1. Because the physical interactions between apoA-I and ABCA1 have been proposed to be important in the lipidation of apoA-I (26Panagotopulos S.E. Witting S.R. Horace E.M. Hui D.Y. Maiorano J.N. Davidson W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39477-39484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the question was raised whether lipid-free apoA-I could bind to different ABCA1 forms. Stimulated cells were incubated or not with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I for 2 h at 37 °C, and then cross-linking with DSP was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, 125I-apoA-I associated with ABCA1 co-localized with both dimeric and tetrameric ABCA1 complex (Fig. 3A), whereas 125I-apoA-I was not found associated with monomeric ABCA1 (Fig. 3). Moreover, the absence or presence of apoA-I did not affect ABCA1 oligomerization (Figs. 2B and 3A, respectively). To verify that ABCA1 oligomerization was not dependent on the presence of lipids, cell lysates were delipidated or not (three times) with ethanol-ether 3:1, and then cross-linking was performed. Removal of total cellular lipids did not prevent ABCA1 oligomerization (data not shown). To determine whether the oligomeric ABCA1 is a homo- or hetero-oligomer, either stimulated or unstimulated normal fibroblasts were labeled with [35S]methionine, and then 35S-labeled ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ABCA1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, the human anti-ABCA1 antibody specifically precipitated no other proteins except human ABCA1. Although it cannot be ruled out that other proteins co-migrate with ABCA1 on SDS-PAGE, the low amount of detectable 35S-labeled material in unstimulated cells did not support this possibility.Fig. 4Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled ABCA1. Either stimulated or unstimulated normal cells were labeled with 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 6 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were then lysed at 4 °C with lysis buffer in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture followed by low speed centrifugation to remove insoluble material. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ABCA1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated on 4–22.5% SDS-PAGE, and 35S-labeled ABCA1 was directly detected by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the relationship between oligomeric ABCA1 complex and the structural properties of nascent apoA-I-containing particles in our cell culture model, stimulated cells either from normal or from Tangier disease (Q597R) subjects in 100-mm diameter dishes were incubated with 10 μg/ml 125I-apoA-I in 6 ml of DMEM for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was concentrated by ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, MWCO 10,000, Amicon), and 125I-apoA-I-containing particles were electrophoretically separated by two-dimensional-PAGGE. As shown in Fig. 5, upper panels, apoA-I-containing particles generated by stimulated normal cells exhibited α-electrophoretic mobility with a particle diameter ranging from 9.5 to 20 nm (second gel). In contrast, lipid-free apoA-I incubated with stimulated ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells was unable to form such particles (third gel), which had a molecular diameter and charge similar to the lipid-free apoA-I incubated in the same conditions without cells (first gel). We next isolated LpA-I particles by using ultrafiltration (spiral ultrafiltration cartridge, MWCO 100,000, Amicon) to discard any lipid-free apoA-I. LpA-I particles were further dialyzed by using a dialysis membrane with a MWCO of 50,000 to remove any remaining lipid-free apoA-I. As shown in the fourth gel, isolated LpA-I particles did not contain any significant amount of lipid-free apoA-I. To further characterize the structure of LpA-I particles generated by ABCA1, isolated LpA-I particles formed by oligomeric ABCA1 complex were incubated with cross-linking reagent DSP, a homobifunctional cross-linker that interacts with the ϵ-amine group on the side chain of lysine residues. The cross-linking can occur both intra- and intermolecularly but only between Lys residues within the reagent spacer arm length of 12 Å (27Bennett K.L. Kussmann M. Bjork P. Godzwon M. Mikkelsen M. Sorensen P. Roepstorff P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1503-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This homobifunctional amine-specific cross-linker also possesses a cleavable disulfide bond. Either lipid-free apoA-I incubated without cells or lipid-free apoA-I incubated with ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells were used as controls. As shown in Fig. 5, lower panel, we consistently observed that LpA-I particles generated by stimulated normal cells contained either four or eight molecules of apoA-I per particle (∼100 and 200 kDa, respectively), which could mostly be reduced back to a monomer by cleavage of the cross-link with DTT. In contrast, both lipid-free apoA-I incubated with ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells and lipid-free apoA-I incubated without cells remained in the monomeric form following cross-linking. To rule out the possibility that cross-linking conditions or iodination of apoA-I might affect the number of apoA-I molecules per particle, the molar ratio of DSP to apoA-I was varied from 5/1 to 20/1, and incubations were conducted at different temperatures (4 °C, 37 °C, and room temperature). On the other hand, unlabeled apoA-I was used in some experiments. We found that neither the amount of the cross-linker nor the iodination of apoA-I affected significantly the number of apoA-I molecules per particle (data not shown). The lipid translocase activity of ABCA1 transporter has been implicated in important functions, including the regulation of intracellular lipid trafficking and the lipidation of lipid-poor apolipoproteins to form nascent HDL-particles (20Denis M.

It is key that we understand the functional properties of this protein and structural basis for its activity. For the first time, we present evidence that a majority of human ABCA1 exists in intact fibroblasts as a homo-tetramer with a possible higher order of oligomerization (Fig. 1). Similar results were also observed with Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human ABCA1, suggesting that the oligomeric ABCA1 complex observed was not due to the use of specific cell types. Interestingly, the absence of ABCA1 monomer as assessed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) suggests that the oligomeric state could even be an essential prerequisite for its sorting, in the trans-Golgi-network and to secretory vesicles. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that other ABC transporters such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, MRP1, or ABCG2 function as either dimers or tetramers (17Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.J. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10700-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Rosenberg M.F. Mao Q. Holzenburg A. Ford R.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19781-19789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of apoA-I binding to oligomeric ABCA1 has not been elucidated, the present study shows that lipid-free apoA-I binds to both dimeric and tetrameric ABCA1 complex (Fig. 3). We believe that these structures are physiologically relevant; it is likely that the tetrameric ABCA1 complex constitutes the minimum functional structure required for the apoA-I lipidation process. However, it is possible that the dimeric ABCA1 is a functional lipid transporter and that other oligomeric ABCA1 complexes function only as a regulator for the level of a dimeric form. Our observation that only a minor proportion of oligomeric ABCA1 exists as a dimer in living cells (Fig. 1A) did not support such a mechanism. The proposed mechanism of tetrameric ABCA1 complex as the minimum functional unit required for the lipidation of apoA-I was further strengthened by our results demonstrating that nascent apoA-I-containing particles generated by the lipid translocase activity of ABCA1 contain either four or eight molecules of apoA-I per particle. Thus, we provide further evidence for a functional link between oligomeric ABCA1 transporter and the multimeric structure of nascent apoA-I-containing particles. We postulate that functional oligomeric ABCA1 complex is required for the lipid transfer and the assembly of multiple molecules of apoA-I on the same particle. Our current results support this hypothesis. We demonstrate that lipid-free apoA-I incubated with ABCA1 mutant (Q597R) cells remained in the monomeric form (Fig. 5, lower panel). Furthermore, we have reported that lipid-free apoE3 incubated with stimulated normal fibroblasts generated pre-β-LpE3 with a particle size ranging from 9 to 15 nm (28Neufeld E.B. Stonik J.A. Demosky Jr., S.J. Knapper C.L. Combs C.A. Cooney A. Comly M. Dwyer N. Blanchette-Mackie J. Remaley A.T. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15571-15578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that pre-β-LpE3 contains four and eight molecules of apoE3 per particle, whereas lipid-free apoE3 incubated with ABCA1 mutant (C1477R) remained in the monomeric form (data not shown). It is likely that the minimum functional unit of ABCA1 is a tetramer that lipidates four molecules of apoA-I at the same time, whereas the presence of eight molecules of apoA-I per particle could be explained by the close proximity of two homotetrameric ABCA1 subunits. This is in agreement with our observation that a significant proportion of ABCA1 exists in living cells as an oligomer higher than tetramer (Fig. 1). Thus, the oligomeric ABCA1 complex generated multimeric nascent HDL particles regardless of the apolipoprotein acceptor. We have assumed that the presence of LpA-I particles having either four or eight molecules of apoA-I per particle is an accurate reflection of the presence of different LpA-I subpopulations generated by the oligomeric ABCA1 complex. It is possible, however, that the heterogeneity of LpA-I particles was in part due to the cross-linking procedure itself (i.e. intermolecular cross-linking may have occurred between separate LpA-I particles, giving rise to apparent higher order oligomers of apoA-I that were not normally produced by ABCA1). Although this possibility cannot be totally excluded, experiments with different molar ratios of DSP to apoA-I and experiments involving a cross-linking at 37 °C or room temperature rather than at 4 °C did not result in significant alteration of the number of apoA-I molecules per particle. Although ABCA1 mutants Q597R and C1477R were found to oligomerize normally (data not shown) and localized to the plasma membrane, they showed the total absence of binding to apoA-I (21Haidar B. Denis M. Krimbou L. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2087-2094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Haidar B. Denis M. Marcil M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9963-9969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the apoA-I lipidation defect observed in either Q597R or C1477R ABCA1 mutants is not caused by impaired oligomerization of ABCA1. Furthermore, C1477R, a naturally occurring mutant of ABCA1 in which cysteine 1477 within the second large extracellular loop is replaced with arginine (10Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H. Roomp K. van Dam M. Yu L. Brewer C. Collins J.A. Molhuizen H.O. Loubser O. Ouelette B.F. Fichter K. Ashbourne-Excoffon K.J. Sensen C.W. Scherer S. Mott S. Denis M. Martindale D.

This suggests that cysteine 1477 is not essential for ABCA1 homodimerization. We are currently investigating the structural requirements for the ABCA1 transporter to form an oligomeric complex. It is well documented that phosphorylation of a number of cellular receptors triggers their oligomerization, which modulates their function. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have shown that ABCA1 phosphorylation by the cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent pathway plays an important role in the apoA-I lipidation process (21Haidar B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41835-41842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is possible that apoA-I induces ABCA1 phosphorylation, allowing ABCA1 oligomerization. Although apoA-I binds to both the dimeric and the tetrameric ABCA1, the presence or absence of apoA-I molecules did not affect the oligomerization of ABCA1 in our cell culture model (Figs. 2B and 3A, respectively). More thorough investigations are required to establish definitively a possible role of apoA-I in the ABCA1 oligomerization process. The molecular organization of apoA-I molecules within nascent LpA-I particles formed by the lipid translocase activity of the oligomeric ABCA1 complex has not yet been determined. However, because of the absence of cholesterol acyltransferase activity in the extracellular medium to convert unesterified cholesterol to cholesteryl ester, it is most likely that nascent LpA-I particles are discoidal. We have previously suggested that the α-electrophoretic mobility of LpA-I particles may be attributable to their high content in phosphatidylinositol (20Denis M. Haidar B. Marcil M. Bouvier M. Krimbou L. Genest Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7384-7394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Davidson W.S. Sparks D.L. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is possible that the high number of apoA-I molecules per particle as documented in the present study may contribute to increase the net negative charge of LpA-I particles and consequently cause their α-electrophoretic mobility. Although the spatial organization of apoA-I molecules within nascent α-LpA-I particles is unknown, Segrest et al. (35Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Klon A.E. Sheldahl C.J. Hellinger M. De Loof H. Harvey S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31755-31758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) published a computer model referred to as the “double belt” model for reconstituted LpA-I particles containing two molecules of apoA-I. In this model, two ring-shaped molecules of apoA-I are stacked on top of each other, forming a continuous amphipathic α helix that wraps around the perimeter of the phospholipid disc in an antiparallel orientation, resulting in the greatest potential for salt bridge connections between the two molecules. It is likely that the conformation(s) of two apoA-I molecules assumed on 96-Å discs might not be the same as that found on nascent LpA-I containing four or eight molecules of apoA-I. Of interest, the presence of heterogeneous subspecies of nascent α-LpA-I having both a different size and number of apoA-I molecules supports the idea that apoA-I conformations on discoidal particles are highly flexible (36Gursky O. Atkinson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2991-2995Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, we wish to make clear that no attempt was made to use these models to give a definitive interpretation concerning the organization of apoA-I molecules within nascent α-LpA-I. Our model presented in Fig. 6 is a simple illustration of apoA-I lipidation by the oligomeric ABCA1 complex. The detailed structural organization of apoA-I within these nascent particles requires more thorough investigations, which are currently ongoing. The results presented in this study provide a biochemical basis for a cellular apoA-I lipidation pathway that involves oligomeric ABCA1 complex in peripheral cells. This process plays in vivo a key functional role in the biogenesis of nascent HDL particles. We thank Karl H. Weisgraber for kindly providing apoE3."

Tuberc. 1956; 74: 109-116PubMed Google Scholar, 12Youatt J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1969; 99: 729-749PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (6Johnsson K. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7425-7426Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and an elevated level of superoxide (13Wang J.Y. Burger R.M. Drlica K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 709-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was identified as a possible reason for the high sensitivity of M. tuberculosis to INH (1Deretic V. Pagan-Ramos E. Zhang Y. Dhandayuthapani S. Via L.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the absence of H2O2 involvement in INH activation implies that a reaction different from either the peroxidase or the catalase reactions is involved, and some reports have suggested that the active participation of KatG in INH activation involves more than just hydrazinolysis (9Lei B. Wei C.J. Tu S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). NADH oxidases are widely distributed in nature, being found in species ranging from bacteria (14Ashrafuddin S. Claiborne A. J. Biol.

The enzyme can be both soluble and membrane-bound, and although NADH is the common electron donor, water, hydrogen peroxide, or superoxide may be formed as products depending on the enzyme. The physiological role of NADH oxidases in many instances is unknown, but the reaction has been described as a detoxifier of oxygen in nitrogen fixing organisms and archaebacteria (16Kengen S.W.M. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and as a possible sensor of oxygen levels in the regulation of muscle contractility (17Xia R. Webb J.A. Gnall L.L.M.

A variation of the NADH oxidase reaction, a “peroxidase-oxidase” reaction has been well characterized in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to require a catalytic amount of H2O2 that is alternately used and regenerated during the reaction of NAD radicals with molecular oxygen (Refs. 18Akazawa T.

Plant peroxidases, including HRP, have about 20% sequence similarity and remarkable structural similarity to the N-terminal domain of KatG proteins, particularly in the vicinity of the heme active site, raising the possibility that KatG proteins may also exhibit an NADH peroxidase-oxidase activity. Indeed, there are reports of NADH being oxidized to NAD+ by KatG in both peroxidase (22Ro Y.T. Lee H.I. Kim E.J. Koo J.H. Kim E. Kim Y.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 226: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and an oxidase-like (7Wilming M. Johnsson K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 2588-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reactions, but the reaction of KatG with NADH has not been characterized. Given the potential importance of any reaction involving NADH in isonicotinoyl-NAD formation, this report investigates the interactions of KatG with NADH, demonstrating an oxygen-dependent NADH oxidase activity and a direct role for KatG in the formation of isonicotinoyl-NAD.

All of the plasmids were transformed into the catalase-deficient E. coli strain UM262 (pro leu rpsL hsdM hsdR endI lacY katE1 katG17::Tn10 recA) (26Loewen P.C. Switala J. Smolenski M.

Subsequent purification of the enzymes was essentially as described (24Carpena X. Switala J. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Fita I. Loewen P.C. Acta Cryst. 2002; D58: 2184-2186Google Scholar). Enzyme and Protein Determination—Catalase activity was determined by the method of Rorth and Jensen (27Rorth H.M. Jensen P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 60 mm H2O2 solution at pH 7.0 at 37 °C. Peroxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using ABTS (28Auclair C. Voisin E. Greenwald R.A. CRC Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 123-132Google Scholar). One unit of peroxidase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of ABTS in 1 min in a solution of 0.3 mm ABTS (ϵ = 36,800 m-1 cm-1) and 2.5 mm H2O2 at pH 4.5 and 25 °C. The peroxidatic substrate o-dianisidine was also tested, but the data are not reported. Free radical production was assayed by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction to a monoformazan (ϵ = 15,000 m-1 cm-1). NADH oxidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 340 nm using ϵ = 6,300 m-1 cm-1 for NADH. One unit of NADH oxidase is defined as the amount that produces 1 nmol of radical or that decomposes 1 nmol of NADH in a solution of 250 μm NADH at 25 °C. The protein was estimated according to the methods outlined by Layne (29Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Visualization of Enzymatic Activities—Gel electrophoresis of purified proteins was carried out under denaturing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as previously described (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 31Weber K.

Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar), except in pH 8.1 Tris-HCl. Following electrophoresis, peroxidase activity was visualized by the method of Gregory and Fridovich (33Gregory E.M. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and catalase was visualized as described by Clare et al. (34Clare D.A. Duong M.N. Darr D. Archibald F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 532-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), but using 20 mm H2O2 for better contrast. KatG mediated oxidation of INH and NADH was visualized using NBT as described by Hillar and Loewen (23Hillar A. Loewen P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—BpKatG was dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium acetate, and NADH was dialyzed against three changes of 1 liter 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, after which the concentration was determined by A340. The matrix solution was freshly prepared each day at 160 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 3:1 water:acetonitrile, 2% formic acid solution. 20-μl reaction mixtures contained 200 μg/ml BpKatG, 128 μm NADH, and 10 mm INH in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 at room temperature. 0.5-μl aliquots were removed at 1 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 18 h and immediately mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution on a metal target. The samples were analyzed on a QqTOF mass spectrometer (35Loboda A.V. Krutchinsky A.N. Bromirski M. Ens W. Standing K.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Determination of Conserved Residue Locations—The locations of residues conserved in >95% of 52 available KatG sequences were determined using the program CONRES. The program identifies conserved residues in an alignment file from CLUSTALW (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

The sequence alignment file included 52 catalase-peroxidase sequences and the structure file for B. pseudomallei KatG (Protein Data Bank code 1MWV) was used as the model. The accession numbers for the sequences included in the comparison are listed by Klotz and Loewen (37Klotz M.G. Loewen P.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 1098-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The source code or IRIX 6.5 executable for CONRES can be obtained from the authors on request. NADH Oxidation by KatG—NAD+ replaces the hydrazine moiety of the anti-tubercular pro-drug INH to generate the active form of the drug, isonicotinoyl-NAD. In an attempt to define more precisely the role of KatG in the formation of isonicotinoyl-NAD, the potential utilization of NADH and NAD+ as substrates was investigated, revealing that NADH supports BpKatG-mediated radical generation (Fig. 1a) in the absence of H2O2 using NBT as radical sensor at a rate approximately equal to the rate of NADH disappearance (Fig. 1b). NADPH supports a slower rate of radical generation, and NAD+ does not support any radical production (Table I). NAD+ was confirmed as the product of the reaction with NADH by HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). Both superoxide dismutase and a lower molecular oxygen concentration reduce radical generation (Table I) from NADH. The pH optima for both radical production and NADH disappearance are 8.75, but the curves are not perfectly superimposable (Fig. 1c), suggesting two different, pH-dependent, fates for the reduced oxygen, most likely H2O2 at lower pH and superoxide radical at higher pH. Unfortunately, the rapid degradation of H2O2 by both the catalase and peroxidase activities of BpKatG precluded its identification or even the observation of any spectral changes in the enzyme during the reaction. The optimum pH for the oxidase reaction is significantly different from the optimum pH levels for the peroxidase (pH 4.5) and catalase (pH 6.5) reactions (Fig. 1c). These results are consistent with BpKatG having an NADH oxidase activity producing NAD+ and either superoxide ion or H2O2 and with a similar activity existing in MtKatG and EcK-atG but at a much lower level.Table IBpKatG-mediated radical production in the presence of different substratesNo enzymeaAll of the reactions contained 200 μm NBT in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.75, supplemented with 10 mm INH, 250 μm NADH, 250 μm NADPH, 250 μm NAD+, and 200 μg of superoxide dismutase as indicated.

NAD+ and pyridoxine act as competitive inhibitors of the NADH oxidase reaction (data not shown). Purified BpKatG migrates as a single band (apparent mass of 78 kDa) on denaturing gels (Fig. 3, lane a) with only a small amount of slower migrating dimer. On a nondenaturing gel (Fig. 3, lanes b–g), catalase, peroxidase, and oxidase activities all co-migrate with the main bands of protein (lanes b–e). The presence of two bands of catalase-peroxidase with the same mass on nondenaturing gels has been noted previously but not explained.Table IIKinetic constants for enzymatic activities associated with BpKatGVmaxKmkcatkcat/Kmμmol·min-1 μmol·heme-1μma[NADH] for the oxidase reaction, [ABTS] for the peroxidase reaction, and [H2O2] for the catalase reactionss-1m-1·s-1Oxidase (ΔA340)540 ± 96 × 10-312.5 ± 2.09.0 ± 0.4 × 10-37.2 × 102Peroxidase1083 ± 29330 ± 3010.1 ± 0.273.1 × 104Catalase902 ± 20 × 1037700 ± 4008.4 ± 0.2 × 1031.1 × 106a [NADH] for the oxidase reaction, [ABTS] for the peroxidase reaction, and [H2O2] for the catalase reactions Open table in a new tab HRP catalyzes an unusual NADH peroxidase-oxidase reaction in which H2O2 is required to initiate the reaction, after which there is a cycling of O2˙−, H2O2, and compound III (reviewed in Ref. 21Dunford H. Heme peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarity between plant peroxidases and catalase-peroxidases, particularly in the active site, the possibility that the NADH oxidase activity of KatG is similar to the peroxidase-oxidase reaction was investigated (Table III). The HRP peroxidase-oxidase reaction is characterized by a need for a catalytic amount of H2O2, by inhibition by SOD or catalase, and by long lag periods in the presence of low [NADH] and high [HRP]. NADH oxidation by BpKatG does not exhibit any of these characteristics (Table III). For comparison, NADH oxidation by the W111F variant, which lacks catalase activity, is reduced slightly by catalase, but not SOD, and is significantly enhanced by added H2O2, attributable to NADH serving as a peroxidatic substrate. No lag in the initiation of NADH oxidation was evident over a broad range of NADH concentrations or enzyme concentrations for either BpKatG or the W111F variant.Table IIIComparison of NADH oxidation by HRP, BpKatG, and the W111F variant All of the reactions contained 100 μm NADH and 100 μg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.75.HRPBpKatGW111FNADH110 ± 18aThe data are expressed as pmol·min-1·nmol-1 heme490 ± 16500 ± 41NADH + H2O2360 ± 22490 ± 242160 ± 180NADH + HPII30 ± 4480 ± 16392 ± 16NADH + HPII + H2O254 ± 4480 ± 16290 ± 16NADH + SOD86 ± 16400 ± 24460 ± 16NADH + SOD + H2O2540 ± 29400 ± 162200 ± 190a The data are expressed as pmol·min-1·nmol-1 heme Open table in a new tab INH Hydrazinolysis by BpKatG—The activation of INH as an anti-tubercular drug by catalase-peroxidases involves removal of the hydrazine moiety and proceeds via a radical producing reaction that can be monitored using NBT as a radical sensor (23Hillar A. Loewen P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The H2O2 independence (Fig. 4a) and enhanced rates at alkaline pH (Fig. 4b) of the KatG-mediated INH hydrazinolysis reaction differentiate it from the catalase and peroxidase reactions (Fig. 1c). There is a pH-dependent, nonenzymatic generation of radicals from INH, but in the pH 7–9 range, the contribution of the enzymatic reaction is clear and suggests a pH optimum between 8 and 9, albeit not well defined (Fig. 4b). To minimize the nonenzymatic contribution, all subsequent assays and reactions involving INH were carried out at pH 8. Oxygen levels do not affect the KatG-mediated radical generation from INH, and superoxide dismutase does not reduce radical production (Table I), confirming that molecular oxygen does not have a role in the reaction. MtKatG catalyzes INH hydrazinolysis at about the same rate as BpKatG, but the EcKatG-mediated reaction is slower (Fig. 1 and Table I). Despite having a pyridine ring as part of its structure, NAD+ does not inhibit INH hydrazinolysis (data not shown). Interaction of KatG with a Mixture of INH and NADH— Radical generation in a mixture of BpKatG, INH, and NADH is about two times faster than the cumulative rate of the individual reactions of INH and NADH (Fig. 5a). This rate is further enhanced by the inclusion of 2 μm manganese ion (either Mn+2 or Mn+3) (Fig. 5b). The rate of NADH disappearance, as measured by the decrease in A340, is similarly increased (data not shown). NAD+ is not a substrate for radical generation, and the rate of radical formation from a mixture of NAD+ and INH is the same as with INH alone (Fig. 4a) and is enhanced by Mn+2 (Fig. 5c). The MtKatG- and EcKatG-mediated reactions of INH and NADH are both slower in the absence of Mn+2 (Fig. 4a) but approach or exceed the BpKatG-mediated reaction in the presence of Mn+2 (Fig. 5b). Based on HPLC retention times (Fig. 2) combined with mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown), the main products of the combined NADH and INH reaction with KatG are NAD+ and isonicotinoyl-NAD with other products being present in smaller amounts. Isonicotinoyl-NAD elutes from the column as four peaks, all exhibiting an ion at m/z 771, consistent with the report of Wilming and Johnsson (7Wilming M. Johnsson K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 2588-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), who explained the elution pattern as the result of two stereoisomers, arising from the addition of the isonicotinoyl group to opposite faces of the nicotinamide ring, each with two rotamers, resulting from restricted rotation of the isonicotinoyl group. The time course of appearance and identity of isonicotinoyl-NAD were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction mixture, and the product ion at m/z 771 (inset to Fig. 6c), coincident with the mass of isonicotinoyl-NAD, was evident only in mixtures containing all three of KatG, INH, and NADH or NAD+. Tandem mass spectrometry measurements of the ions at m/z 753 and 771 produced almost identical fragmentation patterns, confirming that the ion at m/z 753 is a product of the parent ion at m/z 771 (Table IV). The difference in mass between the two ions, 18.014 Da, suggests the loss of H2O (18.016 Da) but offers no clue as to the structural basis for the decay or its cause. Comparison with the fragmentation pattern of NADH clearly confirms the presence of NAD in the pattern of fragments from the m/z 771 and 753 ions (Table IV) degraded from the nicotinamide end and by inference allowing for the isonicotinoyl group, also after degradation from the adenine end (Table IV).Table IVComparison of expected and observed m/z values of ions in the MS/MS spectra of NADH and the product of the reaction of KatG with INH and NADH identified as isonicotinoyl-NADProduct ions (m/z) from parent ionaThe parent ions at m/z 771.154, 753.166, and 666.090 were selected individually and fragmented by tandem mass spectrometryAssigned structurebA, adenosine; N, nicotinamide; IN, isonicinoyl group; R, riboseFormula to calculate expected ionExpected m/zm/z 771m/z 753m/z 666Parent ions771.154IN-NRPPAC27H33N8O15P2771.154753.140753.166IN-NRPPA-H2OC27H31N8O14P2753.144666.090NHRPPA (NADH)C21H30N7O14P2666.133Fragmentation from the adenine end (“y” ions)530.061NHRPPRC16H24N2O14P2530.070514.059NHRPPR-NH3C16H22NO14P2514.052424.093424.101IN-NRPC17H19N3O8P424.091319.073NHRPC11H16N2O7P319.070229.044IN-NC12H10N3O2229.085123.063NHC6H7N2O123.056Fragmentation from the nicotinamide end (“b” ions)649.109NHRPPA-NH3C21H27N6O14P2649.106664.126NRPPAC21H28N7O14P2664.117542.078542.072542.082RPPAC15H22N5O13P2542.069524.059524.067524.067RPPA-H2OC15H20N5O12P2524.058428.041428.023428.040PPAC10H16N5O10P2428.037348.073348.070348.071PAC10H15N5O7P348.071250.094250.087250.100AC10H12N5O3250.094136.070136.065136.064AdenineC5H6N5136.062a The parent ions at m/z 771.154, 753.166, and 666.090 were selected individually and fragmented by tandem mass spectrometryb A, adenosine; N, nicotinamide; IN, isonicinoyl group; R, ribose Open table in a new tab NAD+as Precursor for Isonicotinoyl-NAD—The facile KatG-mediated oxidation of NADH and lack of apparent reaction with NAD+ initially suggested that NADH, not NAD+, is the precursor to isonicotinoyl-NAD. However, isonicotinoyl-NAD is formed in a KatG-mediated reaction more efficiently from a mixture of NAD+ and INH (Fig. 6) than from a mixture of NADH and INH, both with 2 μm Mn+2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, NAD+ is the probable precursor for isonicotinoyl-NAD as concluded earlier (7Wilming M. Johnsson K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 2588-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but NADH oxidation by KatG to NAD+ will lead to the same product in an NADH mixture. The presence of 2 μm Mn+2 greatly speeds the NAD+-dependent formation of isonicotinoyl-NAD by all three KatGs: BpKatG, MtKatG, and EcKatG. NADH Oxidation Can Be Uncoupled from Superoxide Formation—It has been well documented that changing any one of a number of residues in KatG reduces catalase activity with minimal effect on peroxidase activity (38Jakopitsch C Auer M Ivancich A.

The TBET and the IFNG genes, but not the IL18RAP gene, showed preferential acetylation of histones H3 and H4 during TH1 differentiation. Analysis of acetylation of specific histone residues revealed that H3(Lys-9), H4(Lys-8), and H4(Lys-12) were preferentially modified in TH1 cells, suggesting a possible contribution of acetylation of these residues for induction of these genes. On the other hand, the acetylation of IL18RAP gene occurred both in TH1 and TH2 cells the similar kinetics and on the same with residues, demonstrating that selective histone acetylation was not universally the case for all TH1-expressed genes. Histone H3 acetylation of IFNG and TBET genes occurred with different kinetics, however, and was distinctively regulated by cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 enhanced the histone acetylation of the IFNG gene. By contrast, histone acetylation of the TBET gene was markedly suppressed by IL-4, whereas IL-12 and IL-18 had only modest effects suggesting that histone acetylation during TH1 differentiation is a process that is regulated by various factors at multiple levels. By treating Th2 cells with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, we restored histone acetylation of the IFNG and TBET genes, but it did not fully restore their expression in TH2 cells, again suggesting that histone acetylation explains one but not all the aspects of TH1-specific gene expression.

A critical aspect of the adaptive immune response is that naïve CD4+ T cells can develop into distinct T helper (TH) 1The abbreviations used are: TH, T helper; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IL18Rap, IL-18 receptor accessory protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HDAC, histone deacetylase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab. 1The abbreviations used are: TH, T helper; IL, interleukin; IFN, interferon; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IL18Rap, IL-18 receptor accessory protein; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HDAC, histone deacetylase; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal Ab. subsets depending on pathogens they encounter, and appropriate TH differentiation is essential for elimination of these pathogens (1Abbas A.K. Murphy K.M. Sher A. Nature. 1996; 383: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (3844) Google Scholar). That is, TH1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity and critical in protection against intracellular pathogens, whereas TH2 cells are essential for a humoral immune response and elimination of extracellular microorganisms. TH1 and TH2 cells are principally characterized by the cytokines they secrete with TH1 cells producing interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and lymphotoxin, which activate macrophages and TH2 cells producing interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, which promote B cell immunoglobulin class switching (2Glimcher L.H. Murphy K.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1693-1711PubMed Google Scholar).A number of factors, including signals emanating from the T cell receptor are involved in the regulation TH1 and TH2 differentiation, but cytokines themselves are particularly important (3Murphy K.M.

T-bet is another transcription factor that is important for TH1 differentiation, although it is not critical for IFN-γ production by CD8+ cells. T-bet-deficient mice exhibit defective TH1 differentiation and default TH2 response and consequently develop an airway inflammation similar to asthma (22Szabo S.J. Sullivan B.M. Stemmann C.

T-bet also induces expression of IL-12 receptor β2, thus making these cells responsive to IL-12 (24Mullen A.C. High F.A. Hutchins A.S. Lee H.W. Villarino A.V. Livingston D.M. Kung A.L. Cereb N.

Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For instance, naïve CD4+ T cells acquire distinctive patterns of DNase I hypersensitivity at the IFNG or IL4 loci during TH differentiation according to the respective subsets (29Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Overexpression of T-bet has been reported to enhance IFN-γ gene transcription and induce the DNase I hypersensitivity of the IFNG locus and in this manner is thought to promote TH1 differentiation, although a direct role of chromatin remodeling has not been established (24Mullen A.C. High F.A. Hutchins A.S. Lee H.W. Villarino A.V. Livingston D.M. Kung A.L. Cereb N. Yao T.P. Yang S.Y. Reiner S.L.

Cell. 2000; 100: 655-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Although sites of DNase I hypersensitivity are indicative of the accessibility of transcription factors, histone modification is also associated with chromosome structure accessibility and transcriptional activation of the locus (31Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups (32Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 10: 10Google Scholar, 33Fields P.E. Kim S.T. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have demonstrated increased histone acetylation in IFNG and IL4 loci during TH1/TH2 differentiation, respectively, and involvement of Stat4, T-bet, and Stat6 using knock-out mice. Thus, the role of epigenetic mechanisms in lineage commitment and regulation of distinct patterns of gene expression in TH1 and TH2 cells is an important area of investigation.Although TH1 differentiation is regulated by multiple cytokines and transcription factors (34Robinson D.S. O'Garra A. Immunity. 2002; 16: 755-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), exactly how histone acetylation might play a role in the expression of TH1 genes has not been determined. In this study we set out to compare and contrast acetylation and expression for three TH1 genes, IFNG, TBET, and IL18RAP, focusing on the differentiation of human cells. Surprisingly, we found that the acetylation of these three genes is regulated quite differently. We showed that histone acetylation of the TBET gene, like the IFNG gene, occurs preferentially during TH1 differentiation. However the modifications of the genes occurred with different kinetics, and the principal cytokines that govern these modifications are distinct; IFNG gene acetylation is positively regulated by IL-12, IL-18, and Stat4, whereas the TBET gene is predominantly negatively regulated by IL-4. Selective histone acetylation, however, was not universally the case for all genes expressed in TH1 cells. Despite its preferential expression, the IL18RAP gene did not exhibit selective histone acetylation. IFN-γ gene expression correlated well with the extent of histone acetylation of IFNG gene promoter region. However pharmacological restoration of IFNG gene acetylation in TH2 cells did not fully recovered IFN-γ gene expression, indicating that histone acetylation is not sufficient to explain all aspects of preferential gene expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human IL-4, IL-12, and IL-18 were purchased from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, and human IL-2 was from Dr. Reynolds, NCI, Frederick, MD. Anti-CD3, anti-CD28, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-12, and anti-IFN-γ antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen. Anti-acetylated H3, anti-acetylated H4, anti-acetylhistone H3(Lys-9), anti-acetylhistone H3(Lys-14), and normal rabbit IgG were from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Anti-acetylhistone H4(Lys-8) and antiacetylhistone H4(Lys-12) were from Abcam, Inc, Cambridge MA. Anti-Stat4 was from Zymed Laboratory, San Francisco, CA. Sodium butyrate was purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteer cells over Ficoll-HyPaque, and naïve CD4+ T cells were purified with human CD4+/45RO– naïve T cell subset column kit (R&D Systems) or human CD4+ T cell subset column kit (R&D Systems) followed by positive selection using CD45RA beads (Mylteni Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA). Purity was usually >90%. Cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (5 μg/ml) antibodies (Abs) and IL-2 (50 units/ml) for 3 days and expanded in a new flask for an extra 3 days with exogenous IL-2. To induce TH1 cells, IL-12 (10 ng/ml) was added throughout the culture period, and anti-IL-4 Ab (10 μg/ml) was added for the first 3 days. To induce TH2 cells, IL-4 (25 ng/ml) was added throughout the culture period, and anti-IL-12 Ab (5 μg/ml) was added for the first 3 days. IL-18 (10 ng/ml) and anti-IFN-γ Ab (10 μg/ml) were added throughout the culture period when indicated.Gene Expression in TH1 and TH2 Cells—TH1 and TH2 cells were generated as described above, harvested at day 6, and left unstimulated or stimulated with plate-bound CD3 mAb for 5 h, and mRNA was isolated. First strand cDNA synthesis and real time PCR were done as described previously (35Morinobu A. Gadina M. Strober W. Visconti R. Fornace A. Montagna C. Feldman G.M. Nishikomori R. O'Shea J.J. Proc.

Commercial assay reagents for IFN-γ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The sequences of primer pairs and probes for T-bet were described previously, and those for IL18Rap are 5′-CCCACAGTTACTTGGAGAGGCTTA-3′, 5′-GGCATGTGGTAGCGCATTT-3′, and 6-carboxyfluorescein-5′-AGTTCCTCCCAATTCTAGGTTCTGGGCC-3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (26Lighvani A.A.

Levels of gene expression are normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was carried out essentially according to manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 1–2 × 106 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in buffer containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (BACHEM, Torrance, CA), and 2.5 μm 4-nitrophenyl 4-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (Sigma). Nuclei were sonicated to shear DNA (Heat Systems, Farmingdale, NY), sedimented, and diluted supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibodies. A proportion (2%) of the diluted supernatants were kept as “input.” The bead-bound protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C. DNA was recovered by phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subjected to PCR or real time PCR analysis. PCR was carried out with ampliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) for 35 cycles (40 s at 95 ° C, 40 s at 59 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C), and the products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The sequences of the primer pairs used are listed in Table I. In selected experiments, real time PCR was performed to quantify the ChIP assay. The sequences of primer pairs and probes used are listed in Table II.

Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 10: 10Google Scholar, 33Fields P.E. Kim S.T. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To compare the acetylation of both histone H3 and histone H4 in the human IFNG gene, we prepared a series of primer pairs throughout this locus (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B (primer a), the proximal promoter of the human IFNG gene also exhibits histone acetylation in TH1 cells. Interestingly these modifications were observed throughout the IFNG gene, although the differential modification between TH1 and TH2 cells was more evident in the areas surrounding the coding regions than the promoter. Specifically, the proximal promoter region (primer a), the first and second introns (primers b, c, and d), and the 1.4-kb downstream region (primer e) were also hyperacetylated in TH1 cells. To confirm these data, we conducted quantitative ChIP assays using real time PCR in which the IFNG promoter region was amplified (Fig. 1A). Histone H3 and H4 acetylation of the IFNG promoter was higher in TH1 cells than in TH2 cells (Fig. 1C).Stat4 is presumably important for IFNG acetylation, because Stat4-deficient mice show impaired histone acetylation of the IFNG gene (32Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 10: 10Google Scholar, 33Fields P.E. Kim S.T. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar); however a direct role for Stat4 in IFNG gene regulation has not been established. Thus, we set out to determine whether Stat4 is recruited to the regions of the IFNG gene (proximal promoter and the first intron), which have been suggested to be Stat4 binding sites (36Xu X. Sun Y.L. Hoey T. Science. 1996; 273: 794-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Purified CD4+ T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 mAbs for 2 days, rested overnight, and then restimulated with IL-12 for 1 h. Using the ChIP assay, we found that Stat4 binds to both sites on the IFNG gene in response to IL-12 (Fig. 1D). This then provides the first direct evidence of Stat4 binding to the IFNG gene in differentiating CD4+ T cells and thus raises the possibility that Stat4 is involved in the histone acetylation of the entire IFNG locus.Histone Acetylation of the TBET Locus in Human TH1 Cells—Multiple lines of evidence point to T-bet being not only a TH1-specific gene but also a regulator of the accessibility of the IFNG gene (25Afkarian M.

Thus, we next examined the magnitude and kinetics of histone acetylation of the TBET locus in differentiating human TH cells. T-bet gene expression was 4–5-fold higher in TH1 cells than in TH2 cells in our system (e.g. see below, Fig. 6C). Histone acetylation in three different regions of TBET locus examined was also increased in TH1 cells (Fig. 2B), which was confirmed using real time PCR ChIP assay (Fig. 2C). Thus, we provide the first evidence that TBET loci are hyperacetylated in human TH1 cells. The kinetics of modification of the TBET and IFNG genes is presented below.Fig. 6Effects of IL-4, IL-12, and IL-18 on gene expression levels and histone H3 acetylation of IFNG and TBET genes.

Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). For instance, the acetylation of H3(Lys-9) and H4(Lys-8) correlate well with overall H3 and H4 acetylation of the IFN-β promoter following virus stimulation (37Agalioti T. Chen G. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 111: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). To confirm and extend the data presented above (Figs. 1 and 2), we next asked whether preferential acetylation of H3(Lys-9), H3(Lys-14), H4(Lys-8), and H4(Lys-12) occurred in the IFNG and TBET promoters in TH1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, H3(Lys-9), H4(Lys-8), and H4(Lys-12) are preferentially acetylated in both IFNG and TBET genes in TH1 cells as determined by quantitative ChIP assay. On the other hand, H3(Lys-14) acetylation did not distinguish TH1 and TH2 cells. Therefore, acetylation of H3(Lys-9), H4(Lys-8), and H4(Lys-12) residues may contribute to the preferential induction of IFN-γ and T-bet genes in TH1 cells, whereas a modification of H3(Lys-14) would presumably not.Fig. 3Preferential acetylation of the IFNG and TBET genes on specific histones H3 and H4 lysine residues in TH1 and TH2 cells. A quantitative PCR of ChIP samples was performed in triplicate using the IFNG promoter (IFNG-P) (A and B) and TBET promoter (TBET-P)(C and D). Antibodies against acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14 of H3 or Lys-8 and Lys-12 of H4 were used for immunoprecipitation and anti-total-acetyl H3 was also included as a reference control. The immunoprecipitated DNA samples were normalized against input DNA samples and expressed as a ratio to that of total-acetyl H3 in TH1 cells.

The IL18RAP promoter region lies between IL18R1 and IL18RAP genes both of which are TH1-specific IL-12-inducible genes (18Chan W.L. Pejnovic N. Lee C.A. Al-Ali N.A. J.

Sinigaglia F. Certa U. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). As expected, IL18Rap and IL-18 receptor 1 mRNA were higher in TH1 cells (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Surprisingly, however, histone acetylation of the IL18RAP promoter was equivalent in TH1 and TH2 cells as indicated by quantitative ChIP assay (Fig. 4B). The levels of histone acetylation did not differ between TH1 and TH2 cells on both days 2 and 6 of differentiation, suggesting similar kinetics of histone acetylation in these cells. We also compared the residue-specific acetylation of the IL18RAP promoter using the same battery of antibodies described above and observed no significant difference in acetylation of individual residues (Fig. 4, C and D). Thus histone acetylation of the IL18RAP occurs on the same residues in both TH1 and TH2 cells with similar kinetics and to the same extent.Fig. 4Histone acetylation of IL18RAP genes in TH1 and TH2 cells.A basal IL18Rap mRNA expression by TH1 and TH2 cells.

We have shown in transfected tissue culture cells that PIP5K translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane following agonist-induced stimulation of Rho family GTPases. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether Rho GTPases induce PIP5K relocalization in platelets. We used PIP5K isoform-specific immunoblotting and lipid kinase assays to examine the intracellular localization of PIP5K in resting and activated platelets. Using differential centrifugation to separate the membrane skeleton, actin filaments and associated proteins, and cytoplasmic fractions, we found that PIP5K isoforms were translocated from cytosol to actin-rich fractions following stimulation of the thrombin receptor. PIP5K translocation was detectable within 30 s of stimulation and was complete by 2–5 min. This agonist-induced relocalization and activation of PIP5K was inhibited by 8-(4-parachlorophenylthio)-cAMP, a cAMP analogue that inhibits Rho and Rac. In contrast, 8-(4-parachlorophenylthio)-cGMP, a cGMP analogue that inhibits Rac but not Rho, did not affect PIP5K translocation and activation. This suggests that Rho GTPase may be an essential regulator of PIP5K in platelets. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that C3 exotoxin (a Rho-specific inhibitor) and HA1077 (an inhibitor of the Rho effector, Rho-kinase) also eliminated PIP5K activation and trafficking into the membrane cytoskeleton. Thus, these data indicate that Rho GTPase and its effector Rho-kinase have an intimate relationship with the trafficking and activation of platelet PIP5K. Moreover, these data suggest that relocalization of platelet PIP5K following agonist stimulation may play an important role in regulating the assembly of the platelet cytoskeleton.

In turn, PIP2 serves as a precursor for diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate in signal transduction cascades (1Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Three classical isoforms of PIP5K have been identified, designated α, β, and γ, with molecular masses of ∼60 kDa (PIP5Kα and PIP5Kβ) and 90 kDa (PIP5Kγ) (2Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N.

Recently, the fourth member of the family, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase homolog, was identified by Chang et al. (5Chang J.D. Field S.J. Rameh L.E. Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

The differential regulation and/or subcellular localization of the PIP5K isoforms have been reported. PIP5Kα was found to specifically localize to membrane ruffles (6Doughman R.L. Firestone A.J.

Some of these actin signaling pathways depend on intact PIP2 rather than on the products of its hydrolysis (11Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is thought to be due to the binding and displacement of various actin regulatory proteins from actin filaments by PIP2, thus allowing the polymerization of these filaments (13Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Consistent with an important role for PIP2 in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, overexpression of PIP5K has been shown to modulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and to induce stress fibers (14Shibasaki Y.

The relationship between PIP5K isoforms and actin is complex but appears to be regulated by small GTPases of the Rho family. A physical association between RhoA and PIP5K has been reported (19Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the addition of recombinant RhoA stimulates PIP5K activity in lysates of mouse fibroblasts (20Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A.

Consistent with the role of Rho in PIP5K activation, inactivation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B reduces cellular PIP2 levels by 50–90% in several tissue culture cell lines (22Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 23Schmidt M. Bienek C. Rumenapp U. Zhang C. Lummen G. Jakobs K.H.

This results in an inhibition of receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation by phospholipase C and PIP2-sensitive phospholipase D and also induces profound changes in cell morphology. In seeming contrast to these results, Tolias et al. (24Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) demonstrated a link between PIP5K and Rac1 but not with RhoA or Cdc42. In permeabilized platelets, a constitutively active Rac mutant induced PIP2 synthesis and uncapped actin filaments by a PIP2-dependent mechanism (18Rozelle A.L. Machesky L.M. Yamamoto M.

Recently, Oude Weernink et al. (26Oude Weernink P.A. Meletiadis K. Hommeltenberg S. Hinz M. Ishihara H. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7840-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) showed that all three PIP5K isoforms are positively regulated by expression of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in HEK-293 cells, and this results in enhanced cellular PIP2 levels. Lastly, Honda et al. (16Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y. Cell. 1999; 99: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) have suggested that activation of another small GTPase, Arf6, is actually the critical step in PIP5K activation. Thus, there is evidence that PIP5K activity may be regulated by Rho, Rac, or Arf6. Although reports about the association of PIP5K with small GTPases have been controversial, there is agreement that small GTPases regulate the activity of PIP5K isoforms, and this contributes to actin dynamics (14Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H.

Dev. 1998; 8: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancies about which GTPase is critical for PIP5K activation might be attributable to cell type-specific differences. In the present study, we used intact human platelets to investigate the mechanism by which small GTPases regulate platelet PIP2 formation by PIP5K. We demonstrate that platelet PIP5K is mostly regulated by Rho and its effector Rho-kinase. We also show that the activated PIP5K translocates to the platelet actin cytoskeleton, where it is available to initiate actin assembly. Materials—The [γ-32P]phosphate was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, HA-1077, was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The hirudin (2000 ATU) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. The anti-RhoA and anti-Rac antibodies and GST fusion proteins were purchased from Cytoskeleton, Inc. (Denver, CO). Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps X-100) and Brij 58 (Surfact-Amps 58) were from Pierce. The two rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against PIP5K isoforms were further purified using a protein A affinity column (29Saito K. Tolias K.F. Saci A. Koon H.B. Humphries L.A. Scharenberg A. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. Carpenter C.L. Immunity. 2003; 19: 669-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant botulinum C3 exoenzyme (C3) was expressed in bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Following lysis of the bacteria, the C3 protein was affinity purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The C3 exoenzyme was cleaved from GST by thrombin (80 units/liter culture) overnight at 4 °C. The thrombin was subsequently removed with benzamidine-Sepharose 6B. The purified C3 protein was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Platelet Preparation—Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and collected into 0.1 volume of 0.15 m sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min and adjusted to pH 6.5 with 0.15 m citric acid to prevent platelet activation during further isolation. After a second centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with ACD (74.8 mm sodium citrate, 41.6 mm citric acid, 138.8 mm dextrose, and 145 mm NaCl). The washed platelet pellet was then resuspended in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer (20 mm HEPES, 138 mm NaCl, 0.36 mm NaH2PO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) at 1 × 109 platelets/ml. Platelet Activation—Washed platelets (0.5 ml) were incubated with stirring at 37 °C in a lumi-aggregometer (Frenius, Bad Homburg, Germany). CaCl2 (1 mm) was added prior to the addition of 50–60 μm TRAP. As indicated, in some experiments the platelets were preincubated, prior to addition of TRAP, with HA1077 for 1 h, C3 exotoxin for 2 h, or analogues of either cAMP or cGMP for 10 min. Cell Fractionation and Translocation Assay—Platelets were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 2× Triton lysis buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 2% Triton X-100 and kept on ice for 30 min. Platelet lysates were fractionated by established methods described previously (34Fox J.E. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J.

Immunoprecipitation of PIP5K from Platelets—Platelets were lysed in 1000 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100). The lysates were incubated at 4 °C with 10 μg of an anti-PIP5Kβ antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then twice with the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2). Immunoblotting—Samples were reduced in Laemmli sample buffer. After boiling for 3 min, proteins were resolved on SDS polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The proteins were detected by blotting with the appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in Tris-buffered saline, 0.02% Tween, 2% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Detection was achieved using a chemiluminescent probe (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentrations were determined using the micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Phosphoinositide kinase activity was determined as described previously (33Chatah N.E. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34059-34065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, PIP5K activity was assayed in 50-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 142 μg/ml lipid substrate, 4.2 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (4 μCi/assay). Reactions were stopped after 20 min by adding 80 μl of 1 n HCl and then 160 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Lipids were separated by TLC using CHCl3: MeOH:H2O:NH4OH (70:100:25:15, v/v). Lanes containing commercial standards of phosphatidylinositol phosphate or PIP2 were stained with iodine vapors. After overnight exposure of film to the plates, the radioactive spots were visualized and quantitated by a PhosphorImager STORM 820 (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid Raft Preparation—Lipid rafts were isolated by density through a step gradient of 0–40% (w/v) sucrose as described previously (37Dorahy D.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Wonerow P. Obergfell A. Wilde J.I. Bobe R. Asazuma N. Brdicka T. Leo A. Schraven B. Horejsi V. Shattil S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem.

Briefly, resting or stimulated platelets (2 × 108, in 100 μl of HEPES-Tyrode's buffer) were lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 8.3) containing 1% Brij 58. The same buffer was used for the sucrose gradient. The lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose, giving a final concentration of 40% sucrose. The lysate (600 μl) was loaded on the bottom of an Ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with 1 ml of 25% sucrose and 500 μl of lysis buffer, both containing the indicated detergent concentrations. The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Seven fractions, each 300 μl, were sequentially removed from the top of the gradient and added to an equal volume of Laemmli buffer. For immunoprecipitations, the visible light-scattering band (corresponding to fractions 2 and 3, the “rafts fractions”) was recovered in 300 μl. An equal volume of fractions 6 and 7 was used for immunoprecipitation of the “soluble fractions.” Rho and Rac Pull-down Assay—Measurement of activation of RhoA and Rac were performed using commercially available kits (BK036 and PAK02) manufactured by Cytoskeleton, Inc. Briefly, cleared platelet lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with GST-PAK or GST-Rhotekin already bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads to precipitate GTP-bound Rac and Rho, respectively. Precipitated complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and boiled in sample buffer. Total lysates and precipitates were analyzed on Western blots using antibodies against Rac and RhoA. C3 Exotoxin, ADP Ribosylation Assay, and HA1077—Aliquots of cells were taken after the C3 exoenzyme treatment and diluted in 50 μl of the assay buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm GTP, 10 mm thymidine, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Platelet lysates were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 400 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme and 10 μm [32P]NAD+ (specific radioactivity, 2000 cpm/pmol) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm nicotinamide, 10 mm thymidine, 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2 (30Leng L. Kashiwagi H. Ren X.D. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4206-4215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and ADP ribosylation was determined as described by Nemoto et al. (45Nemoto Y. Namba T. Teru-uchi T. Ushikubi F. Morii N. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20916-20920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA1077 was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. Comparison of Relative Abundance of PIP5Kα, PIP5Kβ, and PIP5Kγ in Platelets—The expression of different PIP5K isoforms in platelets has not been described previously. Using polyclonal antibodies that are specific for PIP5Kα (∼60 kDa), or both PIP5Kβ (∼60 kDa) and PIP5Kγ (∼90 kDa), we examined the presence of each isoform in human platelets (Fig. 1). We found all three isoforms to be present. PIP5Kγ is known to have alternative splice sites that produce an 87-kDa and a 90-kDa (so-called “brain-specific”) variant (4Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Because the 90-kDa splice variant has been shown to contribute to focal adhesion formation in tissue culture cells, the 90-kDa PIP5Kγ might play an important role in platelet actin dynamics. Time Course of PIP5K Redistribution in Human Platelets—Consistent with studies of most cells, total cellular PIP2 in platelets does not rise dramatically in response to agonist stimulation of PIP5K (31Wilson D.B. Neufeld E.J. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1046-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This suggests that local increases in the PIP2 concentration may occur at sites of recruited lipid kinases (1Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated in transfected COS-7SH cells that stimulation of the PAR1 thrombin receptor induces a translocation of PIP5Kα from the cytosol toward the plasma membrane (33Chatah N.E. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34059-34065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these cells, the translocation of PIP5Kα was dependent on both Rac and Rho, although the activation of Rho was essential for the trafficking process. Because the regulation of PIP5K appears to vary in different types of cells, we examined the distribution of the PIP5K isoforms in platelets. To determine the subcellular location of PIP5K in resting and activated platelets, these cells were fractionated by established Triton X-100 lysis protocols (34Fox J.E. Boyles J.K. Berndt M.C. Steffen P.K. Anderson L.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1525-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 35Fox J.E.B. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by differential centrifugation. This allowed us to obtain the 15,600 × g fraction (“low speed cytoskeleton fraction” containing actin filaments and associated proteins), 100,000 × g fraction (containing the membrane skeleton), and the 100,000 × g supernatant fraction (containing soluble cytosolic proteins). In resting platelets, PIP5Kβ (Fig. 2) was predominantly present in the cytoplasmic fraction. Gently stirred platelets were stimulated with the thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). TRAP stimulation led to rapid translocation of PIP5Kβ (Fig. 2) to the low speed cytoskeleton fraction. A similar result was found for the other platelet PIP5K isoforms, PIP5Kγ and PIP5Kα (not shown). This trafficking event was seen within 30 s and reached a peak within 5 min. This suggests that similar to our observation in tissue culture cells, PIP5K isoforms relocalize within platelets following agonist stimulation. PIP5K Does Not Localize within Platelet Lipid Rafts—Cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains (GEMs or lipid rafts) are sites of active phosphoinositide and tyrosine kinase signaling. Lipid rafts are found in platelets (36Dorahy D.J. Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Dorahy D.J. Burns G.F. Biochem.

Therefore, we investigated whether the PIP2 synthesis by PIP5K occurred in platelet lipid rafts and whether the agonist-induced relocalization of PIP5K involved these microdomains. To define conditions for isolation of platelet rafts, we used CD36, Lyn, and GM1 ganglioside as markers of this microdomain (Fig. 3A) (36Dorahy D.J. Lincz L.F. Meldrum C.J. Burns G.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The soluble fractions containing nonraft-associated membrane proteins and cytosolic proteins were identified by blotting for cytosolic p42/44 ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) (not shown) (38Wonerow P. Obergfell A. Wilde J.I. Bobe R. Asazuma N. Brdicka T. Leo A. Schraven B. Horejsi V. Shattil S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the cell fractions derived from either resting or TRAP-stimulated platelets, we tested for PIP5K. As shown in Fig. 3B (left panel), we were unable to detect any PIP5Kβ protein by immunoblotting with our polyclonal antibody. Similarly, we were also unable to demonstrate any PIP5K enzymatic activity in raft fractions (Fig. 3B, right panel). Although PIP5K does relocalize to different subcellular domains following stimulation of the platelet thrombin receptor, our data indicate that platelet PIP5K does not traffic into lipid rafts. Rac Is Not Required for Trafficking or Activation of PIP5K in Human Platelets—Reports from various cell types have suggested that PIP5K is a downstream target of Rho proteins (19Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2039912038,"A properly functioning immune system is dependent on programmed cell death/apoptosis at virtually every stage of lymphocyte development and activity. Carbon monoxide (CO), an enzymatic product of heme oxyenase-1, has been shown to possess anti-apoptotic effects in a number of different model systems. The purpose of the present study was to expand on this knowledge to determine the role of CO in the well established model of Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, and to determine the mechanism by which CO can modulate T-cell apoptosis. Exposure of Jurkat cells to CO resulted in augmentation in Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis, which correlated with CO-induced up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein FADD as well as activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 while simultaneously down-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. These effects of CO were lost with overexpression of the small interfering RNA of FADD. CO, as demonstrated previously in endothelial cells, was also anti-apoptotic in Jurkat cells against tumor necrosis factor and etoposide. We further demonstrate that this pro-apoptotic effect of CO was independent of reactive oxygen species production and involved inhibition in Fas/CD95-induced activation of the pro-survival ERK MAPK. We conclude that in contrast to other studies showing the anti-apoptotic effects of CO, Fas/CD95-induced cell death in Jurkat cells is augmented by exposure to CO and that this occurs in part via inhibition in the activation of ERK MAPK. These data begin to elucidate specific differences with regard to the effects of CO and cell death pathways and provide important and valuable insight into potential mechanisms of action.

Full-Text PDF Open Access The balance of lymphocyte proliferation and death is crucial in lymphocyte homeostasis. A properly functioning immune system is dependent on programmed cell death at virtually every stage of lymphocyte development. Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved and highly controlled form of cell death that plays a crucial role in development, maintenance of homeostasis, and immunological responses in multicellular organisms. Dysregulation of apoptosis is implicated in a range of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and autoimmune diseases (1Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (6191) Google Scholar). Fas/CD95-mediated apoptosis plays a pivotal role in a number of physiological processes and seems to be particularly important for immune function (2Sharma K.R. Wang X. Zhang L.Y. Yin D.L. Luo X.Y. Solomon J.C. Jiang R.F. Markos K. Davidson W. Scott D.W. Shi Y.F. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 88: 333Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, promoting Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis could be one possible therapeutic approach to induce tolerance against a transplanted organ, autoimmune disorders, or cancer. In fact, clinical trials are underway looking at site-directed delivery of death receptor ligands as a potential therapeutic strategy.

One of the products, carbon monoxide (CO), is a gas molecule historically associated with toxicity and lethality to organisms exposed to industrial doses. However, against this known paradigm of CO toxicity, there has been renewed interest in recent years in CO behaving as a signaling molecule in many cellular and biological processes (12Maines M.D. Annu.

Balla J. Otterbein L. Smith R.N. Brouard S. Lin Y. Csizmadia E. Sevigny J. Robson S.C. Vercellotti G. Choi A.M. Bach F.H. Soares M.P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This effect of CO was associated partially with the inhibition of apoptosis of endothelial cells. The present study was initially designed to further our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which CO exerts cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic effects. We chose a variety of apoptosis-inducing agents by using Jurkat cells to study apoptosis to see if we could identify potential cellular targets of CO. To do this, we chose both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways by which to induce cell death. In all situations tested including serum starvation, UV irradiation, etoposide, TNF-α, and camptothecin-induced cell death, CO was equally cytoprotective. However, when we tested the effects of CO on Fas/CD95 and TRAIL-induced cell death, we found a profound difference, CO augmented cell death. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been implicated in the effects exerted by CO (20Song R. Mahidhara R.S. Liu F. Ning W. Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 603Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Otterbein L.E. Haga M. Zuckerbraun B.S. Liu F. Song R. Usheva A. Stachulak C. Bodyak N. Smith R.N. Csizmadia E. Tyagi S. Akamatsu Y.

In endothelial cells CO requires the activation of p38 to prevent TNF-α-induced cell death with no effect on the ERK or JNK pathways. In Jurkat cells treated with Fas/CD95, CO prevents ERK phosphorylation, and this does not appear to involve the activation of p38. Our data demonstrate that in Jurkat cells CO augments Fas/CD95-induced cell death and does so in part by inhibiting the activation of the pro-survival ERK MAP kinase. Cell Preparation and Culture—Jurkat (clone E6-1) and the lung tumor cell line H1299 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), cultured in RPMI medium1640, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Reagents—Fas/CD95 antibody was purchased from Pharmingen. Etoposide and N-acetylcysteine (NAc) were purchased from Sigma. Caspase inhibitors were purchased from Biovision (Mountain View, CA). Carbon Monoxide Exposure—For cell culture experiments, CO at a concentration of 1% (10,000 ppm) in compressed air was mixed with compressed air containing 5% CO2 in a stainless steel mixing cylinder before being delivered into the exposure chamber. Flow into the chamber was at a rate of 2 liters/min. The chamber was humidified and maintained at 37 °C. A CO analyzer (Interscan Corp., Chatsworth, CA) was used to measure CO levels in the chamber, and there were no fluctuations in the CO concentrations after the chamber had equilibrated. For all experiments involving exposure to CO, cells were pretreated with CO for 2 h. Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Staining—By using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit from Pharmingen, we followed the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) before transferring 1 × 105 cells to a 5-ml tube. Annexin V and propidium iodide were added to the cell preparations and incubated for 25 min in the dark. Binding buffer (400 μl) was then added to each tube, and the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. Caspase Activity Assay—For caspase activity assay, cells were washed in PBS and lysed by freeze-thaw in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Cell lysates were obtained from supernatants after a 30-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the British Columbia Protein Assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Caspase-8 activity was measured using the Caspase-8 Colorimetric Activity Assay Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Activity (units) is presented as the change in optical density (ΔOD) per mg of protein/h over the linear portion of the OD versus time relationship. FADD siRNA and Transfection—siRNA for FADD was designed and synthesized as described previously (28Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The specific cDNA inserts against human FADD MAPKs were designed and cloned into expression vector system (pSUPER) that directs the synthesis of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in mammalian cells, under the control of the polymerase III promoter. The specific cDNAs were such that they specify a 19-nucleotide sequence against the desired gene, i.e. FADD, and were separated by a stretch of 9 nucleotide from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. At the 5′ and 3′ ends, restriction sites for cloning into pSUPER were included. These inserts were identical to those published previously (28Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FADD protein expression was assessed by immunoblot analysis following transfection of Jurkat cells with FADD-siRNA. Nontargeting siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) as control for nonsequence-specific effects. Briefly, Jurkat cells were grown in 24-well plates and transiently transfected with 1.5 and 3 μg of siRNA mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer's protocol. After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 48 h, the cells were treated with Fas/CD95 in the presence and absence of 250 ppm CO. Samples were then prepared and analyzed for apoptosis or immunoblotting. BCL-2 Adenovirus Infection—BCL-2 adenovirus and control (empty cassette) virus was used as described previously (29Badrichani A.Z. Stroka D.M. Bilbao G. Curiel D.T. Bach F.H. Ferran C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 543Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106/Jurkat cells were cultured in 24-well plates and exposed to 1 × 106 to 1 × 108 plaque-forming units of each virus in 1 ml of serum-free medium for 4–6 h. The cells were then washed and incubated in serum-containing media for 36 h. The cells were then treated with Fas/CD95 in the presence and absence of 250 ppm CO. Samples were then prepared and analyzed for apoptosis as above. Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested via first rinsing in ice-cold PBS and then immediately resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Cellular protein extracts were electro-phoresed under denaturing conditions (10–12.5% polyacrylamide gels) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Caspase-3, -8, and -9 were detected using rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). BCL-2, Fas, HSP70, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), and FADD were detected by using mouse anti-human polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). β-Actin was detected by using mouse anti-human β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Total and activated/phosphorylated forms of ERK were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the total phosphorylated form of ERK, according to the manufacturer's suggestions (New England Biolabs). Phosphorylated ERKs were normalized to the total amount of ERK detected in the same membrane. Primary antibodies were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Pierce). Peroxidase was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. When indicated, membranes were stripped (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm p-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences in measured variables between experimental and control groups were assessed by using Student's t tests. Statistical calculations were performed on a Macintosh personal computer using the Statview II Statistical Package (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Statistical difference was accepted at p < 0.05. Carbon Monoxide Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptosis but Promotes Fas/CD95 and TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—Jurkat cells were pretreated with 250 ppm CO for 2 h and then treated with etoposide (100 μm), Fas/CD95 (500 ng/ml), or TRAIL (100 ng/ml) for 6 h. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Etoposide-induced apoptosis was inhibited by CO. CO also inhibited camptothecin, UV irradiation, serum starvation, and TNF-α/actinomycin D-induced apoptosis (data not shown). CO exposure increased Fas/CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A). In accord with these stimuli-specific effects of CO, BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, was up-regulated by CO in the presence of etoposide as would be expected in cells that are protected, whereas cells treated with either Fas/CD95 or TRAIL showed decreased BCL-2 expression in the presence of CO (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 250 ppm CO, Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis was strongly promoted, as assessed by annexin/PI staining and analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). The amplification in the number of apoptotic cells by CO in the presence of Fas/CD95 was due to the induction of cell death in live cells and not via increasing the proportion of necrotic cells (Fig. 2B). Exposure to CO alone without stimulation had no effect on cell death. We observed similar effects of CO on Fas/CD95-induced death of a lung cancer cell line (data not shown).Fig. 2Carbon monoxide promotes Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. A, annexin V/PI staining of Jurkat cells in the presence or absence of CO (250 ppm) was assessed by flow cytometry 6 h after Fas/CD95 (500 ng/ml) treatment.

We observed that FADD was strongly induced by CO at both 1 and 6 h after Fas/CD95 stimulation (Fig. 3A). One hour after Fas/CD95 stimulation, caspase-8 activity and cleavage were increased in the presence of CO, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Similar to FADD, activation of caspase-8, 9-, and -3 were also observed by CO at both 1 and 6 h after Fas/CD95 stimulation as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). In agreement with the caspase data, we found that the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 was significantly down-regulated by CO (Fig. 4). Because of the increased FADD expression observed in the CO-treated cells, we next tested whether the increased FADD expression was necessary for the CO effects. To test this, we developed an expression vector specific for FADD siRNA. Transient overexpression of FADD siRNA resulted in a specific and significant decrease in FADD expression (Fig. 5A). To test whether expression of the siRNA had functional consequences, we transfected Jurkats, treated with Fas/CD95 in the presence and absence of CO, and then observed that the increased expression of FADD was required for the CO-induced augmentation (Fig. 5B). We next evaluated whether inhibition of the caspases that are downstream death effectors would also interfere with the CO-induced enhancement of cell death following Fas/CD95 stimulation. Jurkat cells treated with the select chemical inhibitors of caspase-3, -8, and -9 prior to CO/Fas treatment showed that treatment with these inhibitors prevented Fas/CD95 killing as well as the enhanced CO effects on cell death (Fig. 6). Conclusions from these findings supported the concept that CO is selective in its effects requiring the specific activation of the FADD/caspase cascades and were not merely a broad nonselective effect of CO on cell death following stimulation with Fas/CD95.Fig. 4CO increases expression of activated caspase-3 and -9 and decreases expression of BCL-2. Protein lysates extracted 0, 1, and 6 h after Fas/CD95 (500 ng/ml) treatment in the presence or absence of 250 ppm CO were assessed for activated caspase-9 and caspase-3 and BCL-2 by Western blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note the time-dependent increase in the cleavage products of caspase-3 and -9, which is indicative of increased activity. β-Actin was used as normalization control.

One hour later, Jurkat cells were exposed with or without CO for 2 h prior to the addition of Fas/CD95 (500 ng/ml).

Exposure to Fas/CD95 results in decreased expression of BCL-2 and is a hallmark signal of the death pathways. Treatment of Jurkats with Fas/CD95 in the presence of CO showed an amplified reduction in BCL-2 supporting the pro-apoptotic actions of CO in this model of cell death. To confirm that this decrease in BCL-2 was specific to the developing paradigm of CO in this model, we overexpressed BCL-2 using adenoviral infection. Fig. 7 shows that BCL-2 overexpression was effective at preventing Fas/CD95-induced cell death and as expected significantly prevented the ability of CO to augment death. CO in the presence of BCL-2 overexpression still showed increased death versus air controls treated with ad-BCL-2, which suggests an additional FADD/caspase-dependent pathway by which CO is inducing death. This would fit the BCL-2 immunoblot in Fig. 1B where CO was not able to completely inhibit BCL-2 expression while augmenting cell death. Of note, adenoviral overexpression of BCL-2 in certain situations results in increased cell death. We performed dose-response curves with the adenovirus. At 10- and 100-fold higher viral concentrations, we noted that the cells exhibited an increased amount of cell death due to the heightened BCL-2 expression that has been observed by others. 2C. Ferran, personal communication. The Effects of CO Occurred Independently of Fas/CD95 Receptor Modulation—We evaluated whether the CO effect on Fas/CD95-induced apoptosis was simply dependent on the regulation of Fas/CD95 receptor expression on the cell surface. We demonstrate that CO did not change receptor levels as assessed by both Western blot analyses of cell lysates (Fig. 8) as well as flow cytometric analyses of single cell staining with Fas antibody (data not shown). Therefore, the effects observed are not dependent on ligand expression. Effect of CO on HSP70 and IAP Expression in the Presence of Fas/CD95—HSPs were first described as a set of proteins, and the expression of HSPs was induced by heat stress. Recent evidence suggests that HSPs can play a role in apoptosis (30Beere H.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of HSP70 expression showed no effect of CO or Fas/CD95 treatment (Fig. 8), indicating that the proapoptotic effect of CO in Fas/CD95-stimulated cells is independent of HSP70. We also studied the effect of CO on the IAP. As expected, Fas/CD95 (Fig. 8) resulted in a rapid decrease by 6 h of IAP, which was unchanged in the presence of CO at the time points tested. It is possible that a more rapid loss of IAP might be observed at a time point earlier than 6 h or, alternatively, in this system IAP is not involved in the effects observed with CO. The Pro-apoptotic Effect of CO in Fas/CD95-treated Cells Does Not Involve Increased ROS Production—CO has been shown to possess both pro- and anti-oxidant effects depending on the situation (31Piantadosi C.A. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 259Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thom et al. (32Thom S.R. Fisher D. Xu Y.A. Notarfrancesco K. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent data indicate that early insulin signaling defects do not fully account for the loss of insulin action. Given that cortical filamentous actin (F-actin) represents an essential aspect of insulin regulated glucose transport, we tested to see whether cortical F-actin structure was compromised during chronic insulin treatment. The acute effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake was diminished in 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to a physiological level of insulin (5 nm) for 12 h. This insulin-induced loss of insulin responsiveness was apparent under both low (5.5 mm) and high (25 mm) glucose concentrations. Microscopic and biochemical analyses revealed that the hyperinsulinemic state caused a marked loss of cortical F-actin. Since recent data link phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to actin cytoskeletal mechanics, we tested to see whether the insulin-resistant condition affected PIP2 and found a noticeable loss of this lipid from the plasma membrane. Using a PIP2 delivery system, we replenished plasma membrane PIP2 in cells following the sustained insulin treatment and observed a restoration in cortical F-actin and insulin responsiveness.

A continuous component of insulin resistance is hyperinsulinemia (1DeFronzo R.A. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar, 2Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This compensatory increase in insulin during the insulin-resistant state initially offsets the reduced ability of insulin to stimulate GLUT4 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4, insulin-responsive glucose transporter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular actin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PKC, protein kinase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4, insulin-responsive glucose transporter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular actin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PKC, protein kinase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. translocation and glucose uptake, which is essential for the maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis. However, in vivo (3Del Prato S. Leonetti F. Simonson D.C. Sheehan P. Matsuda M. DeFronzo R.A. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Rizza R.A. Mandarino L.J.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) studies demonstrate that the hyperinsulinemic state has a negative effect on insulin action. Under normal insulin responsiveness, insulin efficiently promotes the removal of excess circulatory glucose by regulating the subcellular trafficking of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in muscle and fat cells (7Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Activation of GLUT4 translocation by insulin requires a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signal involving the upstream insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) activators and the downstream protein kinase B (Akt) and C (PKC) target enzymes (7Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although distal Akt/PKC signaling parameters remain to be determined, a recent study (8Sano H. Kane S. Sano E. Miinea C.P. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14599-14602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) has identified a substrate of Akt (AS160) as a likely connection between the PI3K pathway and the vesicle trafficking machinery in GLUT4 translocation. In addition to the developing understanding of the PI3K pathway, data implicate that regulation of glucose transport by insulin may also entail the activation of a secondary pathway leading to the activation of the small GTPase TC10 (7Elmendorf J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 190: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Even though this pathway is only partially understood, investigation suggests a role of TC10 in the control of actin dynamics (9Chunqiu Hou J. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol.

Importantly, it has been shown that insulin elicits filamentous actin (F-actin) formation (12Kanzaki M. Watson R.T. Hou J.C. Stamnes M. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2334-2346Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Omata W. Shibata H. Li L. Takata K. Kojima I. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 321-328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bose A.

Thus, insulin signaling to polymerize cortical F-actin apparently represents a required pathway for optimal movement or fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicle membranes to the cell surface. To date, extensive study has built a good understanding of how insulin itself can be involved in the staging of diabetes. For example, chronic exposure to pharmacological doses of insulin (≥100 nm) have been shown by several laboratories (17Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. March Le -Brustel Y.

J. 2000; 348: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to markedly attenuate expression levels and/or activity states of the IR, IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, and GLUT4 proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and, thus, produce a defect in the ability of the cell to respond to subsequent acute insulin stimulation with an increase in GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. On the other hand, similar defects in the ability of insulin to acutely regulate the glucose transport system can be induced by physiological doses of insulin (≤5 nm) that are not associated with disturbances in early insulin signaling (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, defects positioned more distal in the insulin signaling pathway may contribute to the insulin-mediated cellular insulin resistance. In the present study, we provide evidence that sustained exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to a physiological dose of insulin results in a marked loss of cortical F-actin. Concomitant with the disruption of the actin meshwork beneath the cell surface membrane, the hyperinsulinemic state induced a loss of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphospate (PIP2) from the plasma membrane. Reversal of the loss of this lipid via carrier delivery of PIP2 back into the plasma membrane of insulin-resistant cells restored cortical F-actin structure and the ability of insulin to stimulate the glucose transport system under hyperinsulinemic conditions. Materials—Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum and bovine calf serum were obtained from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. (Logan, UT). Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and histone complex were obtained from Echelon (Salt Lake City, UT). Monoclonal mouse phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate antibody was purchased from Assay Designs Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). Rhodamine red-X-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Inc. (West Grove, PA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin, insulin, latrunculin B, and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Treatments—Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 10% bovine calf serum at 37 °C in an 8% CO2 atmosphere. Confluent cultures were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described previously (22Kralik S.F. Liu P. Leffler B.J. Elmendorf J.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All studies were performed on adipocytes, which were between 8 and 12 days following differentiation. Prior to induction of insulin resistance, adipocytes were treated with DMEM, 5.5 mm glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 36-48 h. Cells were then incubated in a serum-free low glucose (5.5 mm) or high glucose (25 mm) media with or without 5 nm insulin for a period of 12 h. During the last 1 h of incubation, the cells were either left untreated or treated with different concentrations of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-histone complex or 20 μm latrunculin B. Acute insulin stimulation was achieved by treating the cells with 100 nm insulin during the last 30 min of incubation. Plasma Membrane Sheet Assay—Preparation of plasma membrane sheets was performed as described previously (23Chen G. Liu P. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following the isolation of plasma membrane sheets, the sheets were fixed for 10 min at 25 °C in a solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 70 mm KCl, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA, and these fixed membranes were used for indirect immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence and Phalloidin Staining—Fixed plasma membrane sheets were blocked in 5% donkey serum for 60 min at 25 °C, incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal rabbit GLUT4 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Pessin) or for 60 min at 25 °C with a 1:50 dilution of mouse phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate antibody followed by incubation with a 1:50 dilution of rhodamine red-X-conjugated anti-rabbit for 60 min or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 45 min, respectively, at 25 °C. For whole cell phalloidin staining, following specific treatments, adipocytes were fixed for 20 min at 25 °C in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline. For labeling of actin after fixation, cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin for 2 h at 25 °C. Subcellular Fractionation—Plasma membrane fractions were obtained using a differential centrifugation method described previously (23Chen G. Liu P. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed and resuspended in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 255 mm sucrose containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were prepared by shearing the cells through a 22-gauge needle 10 times. Lysates were then centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The crude plasma membrane pellet was resuspended in HES buffer and layered onto a 1.12 m sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The plasma membrane layer was removed from the sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. Pelleted plasma membrane was resuspended in a detergent-containing lysis buffer and assayed for soluble protein content. Preparation of F- and G-actin Extracts—After overnight incubations, F- and G-actin fractions were obtained using an F-actin/G-actin assay kit (catalog number: BK 037, Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Briefly, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C and scraped and homogenized in a lysis and F-actin stabilization buffer (LAS1). F-actin was then separated from G-actin by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 37 °C. The F-actin-containing pellet was resuspended in double distilled H2O containing 2 μm cytochalasin D at a volume equivalent to the G-actin-containing supernatant volume. The resuspended F-actin pellet was kept on ice for 60 min with mixing by pipette every 15 min to dissociate F-actin. After dissociation, dissociated F-actin was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The F-actin and G-actin preparations were then assayed for protein. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Actin fractions were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and membrane fractions (GLUT4 analyses) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal G-actin antibody (catalog number: AAN01, Cytoskeleton) or a GLUT4 antibody. All immunoblots were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Values are presented as means ± S.E. Analysis of variance was used to determine differences among groups. Where differences were indicated, the Fisher's Test was used to verify significant differences between groups. p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Translocation Is Impaired by Chronic Insulin Treatment—The generation of insulin resistance by exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to a medium containing a high concentration of glucose and insulin has been well documented (20Ross S.A.

Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial experiments, 3T3-L1 adipocytes preincubated in control medium (25 mm glucose) exhibited a marked response to an acute maximal dose of insulin (30′ Ins) as assessed by GLUT4 immunofluorescence of highly purified plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 1A, compare panels 1 and 3). On the other hand, the presence of a physiological dose of insulin (5 nm) for 12 h was associated with an elevation of plasma membrane GLUT4 in the basal-state and a clear loss in the acute maximal insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 1A, panels 2 and 4). To confirm the accumulation of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane sheets, we used differential centrifugation to isolate plasma membrane fractions. Fractions prepared from control 3T3-L1 adipocytes displayed a characteristic insulin-stimulated increase in GLUT4 compared with plasma membrane fractions prepared from untreated cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with microscopic analyses, the immunoblots showed that chronic insulin treatment was associated with an elevation of the basal-state plasma membrane GLUT4 level and a loss in the insulin-stimulated increment above basal (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1-4). Densitometry analysis of four separate experiments shows that sustained insulin exposure tended to increase (p = 0.08) the basal-state plasma membrane level of GLUT4 and attenuate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by 42% (p < 0.05). Prolonged Insulin Treatment Reduces Cell Surface PIP2 and Actin Levels—There are several possible mechanisms that could account for the decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation by hyperinsulinemia. However, consistent with previous work (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), known proximal insulin signal transduction events including IR autophosphorylation, IRS-1 and Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation, and Akt phosphorylation were not significantly different between 3T3-L1 adipocytes maintained in control medium with or without 5 nm insulin (data not shown). Because the proximal insulin signaling cascades appeared to be fully functional, we next examined the effect of insulin on cortical F-actin. Chronic insulin led to a marked reduction in cortical F-actin as assessed with phalloidin staining of fixed whole cells (Fig. 2A, panels 1 and 2). Red fluorescent co-staining of nucleic acids with propidium iodide was employed to verify the presence of cells (Fig. 2A, panels 1-3). Actin staining was verified in cells with latrunculin B (Lat B, an actin monomer binding toxin) treatment (Fig. 2A, panel 3). In addition, F-actin to globular actin (G-actin) ratio determination by Western immunoblot analysis confirmed that cells incubated overnight in 5 nm insulin undergo a marked reduction in F-actin and an increase in G-actin, consistent with an induced depolymerization of cortical F-actin (Fig. 2B). Since recent data link PIP2 to actin cytoskeletal regulation (25Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 761-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), we next tested to see whether this insulin-resistant condition affected PIP2. The level of plasma membrane PIP2 was markedly reduced by 5 nm insulin treatment as assessed by anti-PIP2 immunofluorescent labeling of plasma membrane sheets (Fig. 2C, panels 1 and 2). The immunoreactivity of the anti-PIP2 antibody was confirmed in cells in which PIP2 levels were reduced by LiCl treatment (Fig. 2C, panel 3). The Loss of PIP2, Actin, and Insulin Sensitivity Is Restored with PIP2 Replenishment—Carrier delivery of PIP2 into insulin-resistant adipocytes led to a dose-dependent replenishment of PIP2 (Fig. 3A, panels 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) and cortical F-actin (Fig. 3A, panels 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Complete restoration of both PIP2 and cortical F-actin was apparent with a PIP2 add-back concentration of 1.25 μm. Thus, we used this concentration to directly test whether the impairment in insulin action occurred as a result of the chronic insulin-induced losses of PIP2 and cortical F-actin. A characteristic increase in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation as assessed by the sheet assay was observed in cells incubated with carrier alone (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 4). Carrier alone did not change the negative consequence of overnight insulin treatment on acute insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 3B, panels 2 and 5). Remarkably, acute insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes rendered insulin-resistant was concomitantly restored by 1.25 μm PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 3B, panels 3 and 6). In concert with our findings presented in Fig. 1, we also observed a slight increase in the basal-state plasma membrane level of GLUT4 under hyperinsulinemic conditions (Fig. 3B, compare panels 1 and 2). Interestingly, we consistently observed that this increase in transporter was reduced by PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 3B, compare panels 1-3). Parallel examination of 2-deoxyglucose uptake showed a concomitant loss of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in cells preincubated in the presence of insulin compared with cells that were not (Fig. 3C). In line with previously published work (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Janez A. Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the hyperinsulinemic condition was not associated with a statistically significant increase in basal glucose transport. Consistent with PIP2 correction of insulin action, the reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport was restored with PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 3C). Given that our control medium contained 25 mm glucose and the combination of high glucose with insulin has been suggested to be the cause of the insulin resistant state (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of hyperinsulinemia on cells incubated in a low glucose medium (5.5 mm Glc). Insulin acutely increased GLUT4 translocation in cells cultured in low glucose medium (Fig. 3D, panels 1 and 4), and the extent of plasma membrane-associated GLUT4 was qualitatively equivalent with that induced acutely by insulin in cells cultured in high glucose media (Fig. 3B, panels 1 and 4), as reported previously (21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in low glucose in the presence of 5 nm insulin for 12 h displayed an increase in the basal state plasma membrane level of GLUT4 and a marked reduction in the ability of insulin to acutely stimulate GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 3D, panels 2 and 5). The effect of chronic insulin on insulin sensitivity in cells cultured in low glucose was strikingly similar to that in cells cultured in high glucose medium and further analyses also revealed a chronic insulin-induced loss of plasma membrane PIP2 in these cells (data not shown). Accordingly, acute insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes cultured in low glucose medium rendered insulin-resistant by chronic insulin was concomitantly restored by 1.25 μm PIP2 replenishment (Fig. 3D, panels 3 and 6). As observed in cells cultured in high glucose, the chronic insulin-induced augmentation of plasma membrane GLUT4 was reduced upon PIP2 add-back (Fig. 3D, panel 3). Taken together, these data suggest that the PIP2-dependent insulin-resistant state was independent of glucose load. We present evidence that plasma membrane phosphoinositide-regulated cortical F-actin structure is perturbed in cells made insulin resistant by hyperinsulinemia. Consistent with previous studies that induce insulin resistance via overnight treatment of cells with a physiological dose of insulin (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the impaired ability of insulin to acutely regulate the glucose transport process did not correlate with reduced protein levels or activation of several known insulin signaling intermediates. In contrast, the associated loss of PIP2/actin during the insulin-induced state of insulin resistance was particularly striking, and correction of that via PIP2 replenishment restored insulin sensitivity. Thus, these data define a novel diabetic-state alteration and reveal a counteractive tactic to normalize insulin sensitivity. Evidence indicates that sustained insulin exposure in the presence of high glucose induces insulin resistance via promoting increased glucose flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway with accumulation of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which serves as an obligatory precursor for the synthesis of O-linked glycosyl side chains of proteins and lipids (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given that chronic insulin treatment was equally effective in diminishing insulin sensitivity in cells incubated in the presence of low or high glucose, our data do not support this possibility. Nonetheless, it remains possible that a sufficient rise in cellular glucose in cells maintained in low glucose could enter the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and contribute, at least in part, to this PIP2/actin-based defect. This model can be tested by examining the effect of glucosamine on PIP2/actin organization, and we are in the process of doing so. Previous work has clearly shown that treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to high concentrations of insulin (≥100 nm) leads to disconnect in insulin signaling (17Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. March Le -Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 1148-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Pryor P.R. Liu S.C. Clark A.E. Yang J. Holman G.D. Tosh D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Janez A. Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, early insulin signaling has been documented to remain intact in 3T3-L1 adipocytes made insulin-resistant by lower insulin concentrations between 0.5 and 5.0 nm (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Nelson B.A. Robinson K.A. Buse M.G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In agreement, we did not observe any reduction in the content or activity of the IR, IRS-1, Cbl, PI3K, or Akt proteins. What we did find is a marked loss of PIP2/actin, and we think that this may represent an early insulin-induced desensitization of a pertinent aspect of the signaling pathway by which insulin stimulates glucose transport. In support of this insulin-induced PIP2/actin abnormality, an analogous loss of actin-based membrane ruffling has been observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with insulin (10 nm) for 10 h (26Janez A. Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4657-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Certainly, prolonged stimulation of PI3K would diminish the amount of PIP2, and increased PI3K-generated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate may result in phospholipase C recruitment to the plasma membrane (27Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). This, in turn, would be expected to further reduce the cell surface level of PIP2. Additional studies will be necessary to address these possibilities. The basal-state plasma membrane level of GLUT4 in cells chronically treated with insulin was increased, but the basal uptake was not changed as reported previously under these experimental conditions (20Ross S.A. Chen X. Hope H.R. Sun S. McMahon E.G. Broschat K. Gulve E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, this chronic insulin-induced cell surface-localized pool of GLUT4 protein apparently is not functionally active. Either these transporters are not completely integrated into the plasma membrane and/or a putative insulin signal to activate these transporters may be desensitized by the hyperinsulinemic conditions. Further study will have to examine these possibilities. Of particular interest is that this increased plasma membrane GLUT4 appeared to be lowered by PIP2 add-back. Given that PIP2 replenishment concomitantly restored cortical F-actin levels, it is possible that cortical F-actin may provide a barrier meshwork, as has been reported in chromaffin cells (28Aschenbrenner L. Naccache S.N. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2253-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Trifaro J.M. Lejen T. Rose S.D. Pene T.D. Barkar N.D. Seward E.P. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 1371-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, a study by Kanzaki et al. (30Kanzaki M. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42436-42444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) suggests that cortical F-actin may not function as a barrier to GLUT4 vesicles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In any case, we are exploring methods to better understand this potential barrier role of cortical F-actin in GLUT4 trafficking. In summary, PIP2-regulated cortical F-actin is targeted by hyperinsulinemia, and remarkably, correction of this disturbance restores insulin responsiveness. Studies currently under way in our laboratory also show that cytoskeletal mechanics in other insulin responsive cells (e.g. L6 myotubes) are negatively targeted by hyperinsulinemia. Our results, together with other published data, favor the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia leads to membrane and cytoskeletal architecture abnormalities, which adversely affect the glucose transport process. We are grateful to Dr. Ping Liu for technical assistance throughout the work."

In this study, the role of DAB2 in integrin αIIbβ3-mediated matrix protein fibrinogen adhesion and cell signaling was investigated. In K562 cells differentiating to the megakaryocytic lineage, down-regulation of DAB2 by DAB2 small interfering RNA augmented integrin αIIbβ3 activation and resulted in an increase in cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Ectopic expression of DAB2 reversed the DAB2 small interfering RNA effect or, by itself, decreased fibrinogen adhesion of K562 cells. Mutational analysis revealed that a DAB2 Ser24 phosphorylation mutant (S24A) abrogated the inhibitory function of DAB2. The spatial and temporal association/interaction of DAB2 and platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (CD61) in both megakaryocytic cells and platelets led us to examine the effect of Ser24 phosphorylation on the interaction between DAB2 and integrin β3. Through cellular localization and co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate for the first time that Ser24 phosphorylation promotes membrane translocation of DAB2 and its subsequent interaction with integrin β3, thereby defining a mechanism for DAB2 in regulating integrin αIIbβ3 activation and inside-out signaling. Consistent with the effect on fibrinogen adhesion, Ser24 phosphorylation of DAB2 was also involved in the negative regulation of αIIbβ3-induced T cell factor transcriptional activity. In contrast, the S24A mutant acted like wild-type DAB2 and inhibited both β-catenin- and plakoglobin-mediated T cell factor transactivation. Hence, DAB2 elicits distinct regulatory mechanisms in αIIbβ3 and β-catenin/plakoglobin signaling in a Ser24 phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manner, respectively. These findings indicate Ser24 phosphorylation as a molecular basis for DAB2 acting as a negative regulator in αIIbβ3 inside-out signaling and contribute to our understanding of DAB2 in megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet function.

These interactions have been shown to modulate cytoskeleton organization, transcriptional activity, and cell signaling of various receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. DAB2 thus plays in a pivotal role in the control of cellular homeostasis. In cells, protein phosphorylation of DAB2 modulates its functional activity during growth factor signaling, megakaryocytic differentiation, macrophage spreading, and cell cycle progression. To date, protein kinase C (PKC) and Cdc2 are the only two known DAB2 kinases (14Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15He J. Xu J. Xu X.X. Hall R.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4524-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The major PKC phosphorylation site has been mapped to Ser24. This phosphorylation site is essential for the inhibitory function of DAB2 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced AP-1 gene transcription (14Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Pong R.C. Wang Z. Zhou J. Hsieh J.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31981-31986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of DAB2 by Cdc2 promotes the association of DAB2 with Pin1, a peptidylprolyl isomerase that regulates the rate of DAB2 dephosphorylation. These findings indicate that DAB2 phosphorylation is important as a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. An appropriate level of DAB2 expression is necessary for maintaining normal cellular and physiological function. In tumors, abnormal expression of DAB2 has been reported in ovarian, breast, prostate, colon, and metastatic pancreatic cancers (16Tseng C.-P. Ely B.D. Li Y. Pong R.C. Hsieh J.-T.

The up-regulation of DAB2 during megakaryocytic differentiation of several hematopoietic leukemic cell lines, including K562, HEL, and MEG-01, has been observed in recent studies in our laboratory; these results indicate a potential function of DAB2 in hematopoietic cell differentiation (8Tseng C.-P.

DAB2 has also been shown to play a role in modulating cell adhesion and the kinetics of MAPK activation using vector-based RNA interference methodology (7Tseng C.-P. Huang C.-L. Huang C.H.

Among the adhesion-related molecules, integrins are a family of major receptors involved in cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and cell-cell adhesion (22Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

In mammalian cells, all integrins are heterodimers composed of 18 α and 8 β subunits noncovalently linked (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). It is clear that integrins bind to other cell-surface receptors to activate a large variety of signaling pathways that modulate many cellular biological functions, including proliferation, survival/apoptosis, shape, polarity, motility, gene expression, and differentiation (22Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar, 23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). In megakaryocytes and platelets, the major integrin αIIbβ3 is expressed at high density in an inactive state (25Calvete J.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 29-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon platelet activation, αIIbβ3 is activated from within the cells (inside-out signaling) so that platelets can bind their major ligand in plasma, fibrinogen, leading to platelet aggregation and thrombosis (26Ginsberg M.H.

Consequently, the outside-in signaling due to the binding of extracellular ligand further activates a variety of αIIbβ3-associated signaling molecules, including focal adhesion kinase, integrin-linked kinase, and Grb2, and transmits signals that modulate gene transcription and cytoskeleton organization (23Hynes R.O.

One such protein, the integrin-linked kinase, is known to associate with the integrin β3 subunit in an activation-dependent manner, and it has been speculated to be part of the process controlling affinity and avidity changes in integrin αIIbβ3 (32Pasquet J.-M. Noury M. Nurden A.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin-linked kinase overexpression leads to the activation of the T cell factor (TCF)/β-catenin signaling pathway, which in turn regulates integrin-mediated cell signaling and gene transcription (33Novak A. Hsu S.C. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Papkoff J. Montesano R. Roskelley C. Grosschedl R. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In this study, the function of DAB2 in integrin αIIbβ3-mediated fibrinogen adhesion and cell signaling was investigated. We report that DAB2 negatively regulates integrin αIIbβ3 activation, leading to the inhibition of αIIbβ3-mediated fibrinogen adhesion and TCF transcriptional activity. We further demonstrate that Ser24 phosphorylation is crucial for membrane translocation of DAB2 and its interaction with the integrin β3 cytoplasmic tail, thereby defining Ser24 phosphorylation as a key step in eliciting DAB2 inhibitory function in integrin αIIbβ3 activation and inside-out signaling. These findings contribute to our understanding of DAB2 in megakaryocytic differentiation and platelet function. Materials—The anti-p96 and anti-PAC-1 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences.

Establishment of DAB2 Small Interfering RNA (siDAB2) Stable Cell Lines—The K562 subline K562-9 was transfected with 6 μg of pCI-siDAB2 or pCI-neo with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. 48 h after transfection, cells were diluted with RPMI 1640 medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 for single cell cloning in 96-well plates. Following 4 weeks of selection and expansion, the stable lines were characterized by Western blot analysis and maintained in selective medium containing 300 μg/ml G418 for biological and functional analysis. Cell Aggregation and Cell Adhesion Assay—The assay for cell aggregation and cell adhesion to culture plates was performed as described previously (7Tseng C.-P. Huang C.-L. Huang C.H. Cheng J.-C. Stern A. Tseng C.H. Chiu D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For assay of cell adhesion to fibrinogen, 5 × 105 cells/well in 500 μl of medium plus 500 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and TSM buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2) were added to a 24-well non-tissue culture plate precoated with fibrinogen (10 μg). After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed and washed three times with 2 ml of warmed 0.5% bovine serum albumin and TSM buffer. The adhesive cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 15 min. Finally, the dye was eluted with Sorenson's buffer, and A570 nm was determined for quantification of cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Flow Cytometry Analysis—For analysis of PAC-1 binding and CD61 expression, K562 cells were incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-PAC-1 antibody (20 μl) and with the mouse anti-human CD61 monoclonal antibody (1:500) followed by the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis was then performed using the FACScan system with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—K562 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2% CHAPS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EGTA) and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as described previously (7Tseng C.-P. Huang C.-L. Huang C.H. Cheng J.-C. Stern A. Tseng C.H. Chiu D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Analysis—The recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed and affinity-purified from bacteria as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion protein (∼25 μg) was then incubated overnight with 1 mg of cell lysates in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three washes with lysis buffer, excess glutathione (20 mm) was added to elute the GST fusion protein and any associated protein from the beads. The eluted proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Luciferase Activity Assay—Following transient transfection of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid and expression constructs, cell density was adjusted to 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well culture plates, and cells were cultured for 24 h. The transfected cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer, and an equal amount of cell extract was mixed with luciferase assay reagent II. The firefly luciferase activity was measured with a Lumat LB 9507 tube luminometer. Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells were directly incubated with antibody (for CD61) or fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution at 37 °C for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (for DAB2). After several washes with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, the fixed cells were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated with the indicated antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) at room temperature for 1 h. The nucleus was visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Finally, the cells were cytospun on a glass slide and mounted, ready for observation by confocal microscopy. Isolation of CD34+Cells from Cord Blood and ex Vivo Megakaryocytic Differentiation—Mononuclear cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood using Ficoll-Paque Plus (1.077 g/ml). After centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 30 min, the mononuclear cells were transferred to a 50-ml tube, followed by several washes with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The cell suspension was mixed with Fc receptor-blocking reagents and Microbeads conjugated to the mouse anti-human CD34 monoclonal antibody and subjected to an autoMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec). The enriched CD34+ cells were induced to megakaryocytic differentiation by culture in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml thrombopoietin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.8 μg/ml lecithin, 0.78 μg/ml cholesterol, 0.28 μg/ml linoleic acid, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 28 ng/ml CaCl2. Megakaryocytic differentiation was confirmed by the presence of a CD61 surface marker using flow cytometry analysis. Platelet Isolation—Peripheral blood was drawn from healthy drug-free volunteers. Approximately 60 ml of blood was mixed with the anticoagulant solution (acid/citrate/dextrose) at a ratio of 9:1 and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma. The platelets were gently resuspended in 4 ml of prostaglandin E1 buffer supplemented with 50 units/ml heparin and centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 8 min. After several washes with Tyrode's buffer, the platelet lysates were isolated for Western blot analysis. Cellular Fractionation—K562 cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm leupeptin, and 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the soluble cytosolic fraction. The resulting pellets were washed twice and dissolved in extraction buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 49,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected as the particulate fraction. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test was used for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effects of siDAB2 on K562 Cell Adhesion to Culture Plates and Fibrinogen—To elucidate the role of DAB2 in blood cell differentiation and adhesion, K562-9 cells, a clonal subline of K562 retaining the properties of TPA-induced DAB2 and integrin β3 expression as well as the characteristics of megakaryocytic morphological changes, were stably transfected with the human-specific siDAB2 expression plasmid. The siDAB2 stable line K562-si19 had significantly reduced basal and TPA-induced DAB2 protein levels in comparison with the vector control cells (K562-V7) and the parental cells (K562-9) (Fig. 1A). Both K562-si19 and K562-V7 cells displayed identical cell growth rates and did not adhere to the culture plates under general culture conditions (Fig. 1, B and C). Upon TPA-mediated megakaryocytic differentiation, K562-si19 cells did not undergo cell-cell aggregations, as observed in K562-V7 and K562-9 cells. In contrast, K562-si19 cells adhered to the cell culture plates (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with our previous findings (7Tseng C.-P. Huang C.-L. Huang C.H. Cheng J.-C. Stern A. Tseng C.H. Chiu D.T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and indicate that DAB2 plays a role in cell adhesion during megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. Fibrinogen is a major matrix protein involved in the function of megakaryocytes and platelets in peripheral blood. Hence, the effects of siDAB2 on fibrinogen adhesion were determined using both K562-si19 and K562-V7 cells. Under usual growing conditions, these two stable lines have little fibrinogen adhesive activity and do not adhere well to plates precoated with fibrinogen. In the presence of TPA, K562-V7 fibrinogen adhesion increased by >30-fold. For K562-si19 cells, the adhesive activity for fibrinogen was increased by >111-fold compared with K562-V7-E control cells and by 2.5-fold compared with K562-V7-T cells (Fig. 1D). The effect of siDAB2 on fibrinogen adhesion was further demonstrated in transient transfection experiments. The transfection efficiency was ∼58% according to a control transfection with an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression plasmid (data not shown). Similar to the results with K562-si19 cells, transfection of the siDAB2 plasmid Dab2-2112 significantly increased fibrinogen adhesion of K562 cells in the presence of TPA (Fig. 2A). However, small interfering RNAs targeting firefly luciferase (Ff1) and the HCV 5′-noncoding region (HCVsi) did not alter cell adhesion to fibrinogen. Most significantly, the effect of Dab2-2112 on cell adhesion could be reversed by coexpression of rat DAB2 p82, which was not the target of and was not down-regulated by Dab2-2112 (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that DAB2 is a negative regulator that modulates fibrinogen adhesion of K562 cells. siDAB2 Modulates Fibrinogen Adhesion through Activation of Integrin αIIbβ3—Integrin αIIbβ3 is usually involved in the fibrinogen adhesion of megakaryocytes and platelets. Whether or not DAB2 has any effect on integrin αIIbβ3 expression and activation was investigated in the following experiments. At first, to provide direct evidence for the involvement of integrin αIIbβ3 in the fibrinogen adhesion of K562 cells and their sub-lines, the anti-PAC-1 antibody, which recognizes the active form of αIIbβ3 and inhibits specifically αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion (35Taub R.

Increasing concentrations of the anti-PAC-1 antibody (but not the control antibody) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of TPA-induced fibrinogen adhesion of both K562 and K562-V7 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The anti-PAC-1 antibody also caused inhibition of the siDAB2-mediated increase in fibrinogen adhesion in K562-si19 cells (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that integrin αIIbβ3 is involved in the fibrinogen adhesion of K562 cells and their sublines. The expression and activation status of integrin αIIbβ3 were then compared in K562-V7 and K562-si19"

Exposure of cells to growth factors, prostaglandin, and certain nitric oxide donors also induces HIF-1α expression under non-hypoxic conditions. We demonstrate that muscarinic acetylcholine signals induce HIF-1α expression and transcriptional activity in a receptor subtype-specific manner using HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing each of M1-M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The muscarinic signaling pathways inhibited HIF-1α hydroxylation and degradation and induced HIF-1α protein synthesis that was confirmed by pulse labeling studies. Muscarinic signal-induced HIF-1α protein and HIF-1-dependent gene expression were blocked by treating cells with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MAP kinase kinase, or tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. Dominant-negative forms of Ras and/or Rac-1 significantly suppressed HIF-1 activation by muscarinic signaling. Signaling via M1- and M3- but not M2- or M4-AchRs promote accumulation and transcriptional activation of HIF-1α.

Signaling via the HER2/neu or IGF-1 receptor-tyrosine kinase induces HIF-1 expression by an oxygen-independent mechanism. HER2/neu activation increases the rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the downstream serine-threonine kinases AKT (protein kinase B) and FRAP (FKBP/rapamycin-associated protein; also known as mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)) (12Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). IGF-1-induced HIF-1α synthesis is dependent upon both the PI3K and MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways (13Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

The effect of HER2/neu signaling on HIF-1α protein translation is dependent upon the presence of the 5′-untranslated region of HIF-1α mRNA.

Notably, cellular receptors for these agents are heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). Moreover, a constitutively active GPCR encoded by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus/human herpes virus 8 is reported to induce HIF-1 activation in a MAPK-dependent manner (15Sodhi A. Montaner S. Patel V. Zohar M. Bais C. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4873-4880PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR)-mediated signals induce HIF-1 activation in a receptor-subtype specific manner using HEK293 cells transfected with various types of mAchR. Signaling via M1- and M3- but not M2- or M4-AchRs promote accumulation and transcriptional activation of HIF-1α. We also provide evidence that the activation is dependent on Gα- or Gβγ-dependent and tyrosine kinase, MAPK, and PI3K activity.

Hypoxic Treatment—Tissue culture dishes were transferred to a modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA) which was flushed with 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2, sealed, and placed at 37 °C (29Hirota K.

Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21166-21172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g to pellet cell debris. For HIF-1α and HIF-1β, 100-μg aliquots were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot assay using mouse monoclonal antibodies against HIF-1α or HIF-1β (H1α67 and H1β234; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) at 1:1000 dilution. Signal was developed using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of phosphorylated proteins, HEK293 cells were treated with CCH and 50-μg aliquots were analyzed using specific antibodies (1:1000 dilution) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA).

RNA Blot Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from HEK293 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) 24 h after CCH stimulation and 48 h after transfection of expression plasmid encoding AchR. 10-μg aliquots of RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond N +membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled human HIF-1α or VEGF cDNA probe as described previously (13Fukuda R.

Reporter Gene Assays—Reporter assays were performed in HEK293 cells as described previously (29Hirota K. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Cells were transferred to 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well on the day before transfection. FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transfection. For luciferase assay, each mAchR, the reporter gene plasmid, and the control plasmid pTK-RL (Promega), containing a thymidine kinase promoter upstream of Renilla reniformis luciferase coding sequences, were pre-mixed with the transfection reagent. In each assay the total amount of DNA was held constant by addition of empty vector. After treatment, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was determined using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity was determined. For each experiment, at least two independent transfections were performed in triplicate. β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity was determined using a commercial assay system (Roche Applied Science) (32Hirota K. Murata M. Itoh T. Yodoi J. Fukuda K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25953-25958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To normalize β-gal activity of each sample, pGL-Control plasmid was co-transfected with a β-gal-coding plasmid. Net β-gal count of each sample was divided by its luciferase count and normalized mean count ± S.D. of three independent transfections is shown as relative activity. Metabolic Labeling Assay—The protocol is described elsewhere (12Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were plated in a 10-cm dish, and transfected with M1-AchR plasmid, and 18 h later the cells were serum-starved for 20 h. The cells were pretreated with 100 μm CCH or IGF-1 for 30 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. [35S]Met-Cys was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mCi/ml, and the cells were pulse-labeled for 20–40 min and then harvested. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and 1 mg of extract was precleared with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Twenty microliters of anti-HIF-1α antibody H1α67 was added to the supernatant and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Forty microliters of protein A-Sepharose was added, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, pelleted, and washed five times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. In Vitro HIF-1α-VHL Interaction Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled VHL protein was synthesized in vitro and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIF-1α-(429–608) fusion protein was expressed in E. coli as described previously (20Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells expressing M1-or M2-AchR were treated with CCH or DFX for 4 h prior to lysate preparation. GST-HIF-1α-(429–608) was preincubated with 10 μl of the HEK293 cell lysate for 30 min at 30 °C. 5-μl aliquots of the GST-HIF-1α-(429–608) preincubation and VHL in vitro translation reactions were mixed in 150 μl of NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). After 90 min at 4 °C, 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added. After 30 min of mixing on a rotator, beads were washed three times with NETN buffer. Proteins were eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors Induce HIF-1 Activity in a Receptor Subtype-specific Manner under Non-hypoxic Conditions—Because HEK293 cells express only low levels of mAchRs (33Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 30: 633-673Crossref Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), it is possible to examine the effect of individual mAchR signaling on HIF-1 activation by overexpression of each mAchR. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmid encoding the M1-, M2-, M3-, or M4-AchR and stimulated by the addition of the cholinergic agonist CCH. As shown in Fig. 1A, p42ERK2/p44ERK1 MAPKs were activated in response to treatment with CCH (100 μm) (lanes 4, 6, 8, and 10). CCH simulation also induced transcriptional activation of Elk-1 in mAchR-expressing HEK293 cells (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate that each mAchR subtype was functionally expressed in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to CCH stimulation were similar, suggesting that the different mAchRs were expressed at comparable levels. Using this system we investigated impact of mAchR stimulation on activation of HIF-1. 100 μm CCH increased HIF-1α protein levels in M1- or M3-AchR- but not in M2- or M4-AchR-expressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). In contrast, HIF-1β protein levels were not affected by the binding of CCH to mAchR in HEK293 cells. The induction of HIF-1α expression was inhibited by atropine, demonstrating that the effect is receptor agonist-specific (Fig. 1C). The M1- or M3-AchR signal induced the accumulation of HIF-1α in a CCH dose-dependent manner to 100 nm (Fig. 1D). In M1-transfected HEK293 cells exposed to CCH (100 μm), HIF-1α protein levels peaked at 4 h (Fig. 1E). We next investigated involvement of mAchR in HIF-1α protein accumulation in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells, which endogenously express M3-AchR. Treatment with CCH (100 μm) induced accumulation HIF-1α protein in 4 h and this accumulation was inhibited by treatment with atropine (Fig. 1F). Thus mAchR-mediated signals induced HIF-1α protein accumulation under non-hypoxic conditions. M1- or M3-AchR Stimulation Activates HIF-1-dependent Gene Expression—We examined the impact of mAchR system on HIF-1-dependent gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2, VEGF gene expression was induced in M1-AchR-expressing HEK293 cells exposed to CCH (100 μm) or to the iron chelator DFX. The expression of HIF-1α mRNA was not affected by any treatment. Next, HEK293 cells were transfected with reporter plasmid p2.1, which contains a HIF-1-dependent HRE, or p2.4, which contains a mutated, non-functional HRE. Stimulation of M1- or M3-AchR with CCH induced HRE-dependent expression comparably to 100 μm DFX treatment (Fig. 3A). The activation was CCH dose-dependent (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the reporter p2.4 was not activated by the treatment. Expression of a dominant negative form of HIF-1α markedly reduced p2.1 reporter gene expression, demonstrating that gene activation was both HRE- and HIF-1-specific (Fig. 3C). CCH treatment of cells expressing M1-AchR also induced expression of the pVEGF-KpnI reporter, which contains promoter sequences encompassing nucleotides –2274 to +379 relative to the transcription start site of the VEGF gene. In contrast, CCH had no effect on VEGF promoter activity in cells transfected with expression vector M2-AchR or empty vector (Fig. 3D). Involvement of G Proteins in M1- or M3-AchR Stimulation— Because mAchRs are G protein-coupled receptors, we examined involvement of G proteins in the activation of HIF-1. Because M1- or M3-AchR mainly couples with Gαq protein in HEK293 cells (33Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 30: 633-673Crossref Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 34Caulfield M.P. Birdsall N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar), we first examined involvement of Gαq in the process. Expression of a constitutively activated form of Gαq (Gαq-Q209L) induced the accumulation of HIF-1α protein (Fig. 4A, lane 3) in HEK293 cells. Expression of Gα12-Q229L or Gα13-Q226L also induced the accumulation of HIF-1α (lanes 4 and 5). M1-AchR-mediated HIF-1α accumulation was not affected by treatment with pertussis toxin, which blocks interaction of Gαi GTPase with receptors (Fig. 4B). Stimulation of the endogenous β-adrenergic receptor with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol did not induce HIF-1α protein accumulation, suggesting that Gαs-mediated signaling did not contribute to HIF-1α accumulation (Fig. 4C) (35Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively activated form of Gαq-, Gα12-, Gα13-, or Gβγ-induced HRE-dependent reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4D). M1-AchR Stimulation Stabilizes β-Galactosidase Fused to the O2-dependent Degradation Domain of HIF-1α—We examined the impact of M1-AchR-mediated signaling on the stability of HIF-1α protein by transfecting cells with expression vector pCH-NLS-HIF1α-(548–603)-LacZ, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of β-gal and the HIF-1α sequences encompassing the hydroxylation site at Pro-564. The levels of this protein, which can be monitored by measuring β-gal activity, are negatively regulated by O2-dependent hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation (22Harada H. Hiraoka M. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2013-2018PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transfected with M1-AchR and pCH-NLS-HIF1α-(548–603)-LacZ were treated with CCH, DFX, or IGF-1 and lysates were analyzed for β-gal activity. As shown in Fig. 5A, CCH (100 μm) stimulation induced β-gal activity although to a lesser extent than DFX. In contrast, IGF-1 stimulation did not significantly induce β-gal activity. These data suggest that M1-AchR signaling results in stabilization of HIF-1α protein. To further investigate whether mAchR signaling affected HIF-1α protein half-life, mAchR-expressing HEK293 cells were treated with CCH, IGF-1, or DFX for 4 h to induce HIF-1α expression, CHX was added to block ongoing protein synthesis, and cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot assay (Fig. 5B). In the presence of CHX, the half-life of HIF-1α was more than 60 min in DFX-treated cells, ∼30 min in CCH-treated cells, and less than 15 min in IGF-1-treated cells. These results indicate that M1-AchR stimulation induced accumulation of HIF-1α by increasing protein half-life. To analyze the rate of HIF-1α synthesis, serum-starved HEK293 cells were pretreated with CCH or IGF-1 for 30 min and then pulse-labeled with [35 S]Met-Cys for 40 min, followed by immunoprecipitation of HIF-1α (Fig. 5C). In contrast to control serum-starved cells, 35S-labeled HIF-1α was clearly increased in CCH-treated cells as well as IGF-1-treated cells (Fig. 5C, upper). Expression of HIF-1α mRNA was not affected during treatment (lower). Thus, both the cycloheximide and metabolic labeling experiments provide evidence for increased synthesis of HIF-1α in response to M1-mediated signal. AchR Signaling Inhibits the Interaction of HIF-1α and VHL—Incubation of a GST-HIF-1α-(429–608) fusion protein with control lysate from untreated cells resulted in prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α and interaction with VHL (Fig. 6, lane 1). Lysate from DFX-treated 293 cells did not promote the interaction of GST-HIF-1α with VHL (lane 2). Lysate from CCH-treated M1-AchR-expressing cells was less effective in promoting the interaction (lane 5) than lysate from M1-AchR expressing cells without CCH treatment (lane 4). In contrast, lysates from M2-AchR-expressing cells promoted the interaction of GST-HIF-1α with VHL regardless of whether they were exposed to CCH or not (lanes 6 and 7). mAchR Signaling Stimulates the Transcriptional Activity of HIF-1α—Two independent transactivation domains have been localized to amino acid residues 531–575 (TAD-N) and 786–826 (TAD-C) of HIF-1α (8Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 20Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Because it has been shown that steady-state levels of the fusion proteins containing GAL4 DNA-binding domain and HIF-1α TAD are similar under hypoxic and non-hypoxic condition, these GAL4-HIF-1α fusion proteins can be utilized to analyze HIF-1α TAD activity independent of any effects on protein expression. Activity of TAD-N is hypoxia-induced whereas TAD-C is constitutively active. M1- or M3-AchR stimulation enhanced gene expression mediated by GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–826), which contains both TAD-N and TAD-C (Fig. 7). GAL4-HIF-1α-(531–575)-mediated gene expression is also stimulated by M1- or M3-AchR, indicating that TAD-N function is regulated by mAchR signaling. The activity of GAL4-HIF-1α-(786–826) was not affected by mAchR stimulation. Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on AchR-mediated HIF-1 Activation—To investigate further the molecular mechanisms whereby muscarinic receptors activate HIF-1, M1-AchR-expressing HEK293 cells were stimulated by CCH under treatment with LY294002, PD98059, SB203580, GF109203X, or genistein which are selective pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K, MEK, p38 MAPK, PKC, and tyrosine kinase activity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 8A, genistein almost completely inhibited HIF-1α accumulation induced by CCH (lane 7) similar to the effect of atropine (lane 8). GF109203X (lane 6) partially inhibited HIF-1α accumulation (lane 6), whereas treatment with LY294002 (lane 3), PD98059 (lane 4), or SB203580 (lane 5) had little or no effect. Next, we investigated the effect of the inhibitors on HRE-dependent gene expression using the HRE-dependent p2.1 reporter (Fig. 8B). Genistein or PD98059 almost completely suppressed the gene expression by CCH. GF109203X had a partial inhibitory effect. In contrast, treatment with LY294002 or SB203580 did not have any inhibitory effect. The transcriptional activity of HIF-1α was examined using pGAL4/HIF-1α-(531–826) and pG5E1bLuc (Fig. 8C). PD98059 or GF109203X almost completely suppressed HIF-1α TAD activation induced by CCH. In contrast, treatment with genistein, LY294002, or SB203580 did not block TAD function induced by CCH. Previously, we demonstrated that small G protein Ras and Rac1 are involved in hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation process (29Hirota K. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21166-21172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We next examined involvement of Ras and Rac1 in the CCH-induced HIF-1 activation (Fig. 8D). Expression of dominant negative forms of Ras (RasN17) or Rac1 (Rac1N17) inhibited CCH-induced HRE-dependent gene expression in M1-AchR-expressing HEK293 cells. Expression of a dominant negative form of MEK1 or MEK5 also inhibited CCH-induced gene expression (Fig. 8E), which is consistent with the observed effects of PD98059 in Fig. 8B. Molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of five distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes referred to as M1-M5 (33Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 30: 633-673Crossref Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The M1-M5 receptors are members of the GPCR superfamily. Although even numbered receptors (M2 and M4) are selectively coupled to G proteins of the Gαi/Gαo family, the odd-numbered receptors (M1, M3, and M5) are preferentially linked to Gαq/Gα11 proteins (16Fukuda K. Kubo T. Akiba I. Maeda A. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 327: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Fukuda K. Higashida H. Kubo T. Maeda A. Akiba I. Bujo H. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated signals induce HIF-1 activation under non-hypoxic conditions in a receptor subtype-specific manner. Only odd numbered receptors induced HIF-1α protein expression and transcriptional activity in a receptor-ligand-dependent manner in HEK293 cells. Expression of a constitutively activated form of Gαq, Gα12, Gα13, or Gβγ is sufficient to induce accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-1-mediated transcription (Fig. 4D). The selective effect of M1- or M3-versus M2- or M4-AchR signaling does not appear to be related to the level of receptor expression based on the ERK activation (Fig. 1A). HIF-1α protein expression level is determined by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation (12Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 13Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38205-38211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). CCH stimulation of M1-expressing HEK293 cells increased the half-life of HIF-1α protein compared with that in IGF-1-treated cells although the effect was less than that induced by DFX, which inhibits HIF-1α prolyl hydroxylases (Fig. 5B). CCH also induced stabilization of HIF-1α-(548–603)-β-gal fusion protein in HEK293 cells expressing M1-AchR (Fig. 5A). Moreover, lysate of M1-expressing HEK293 cells stimulated by CCH was less effective than lysate from unstimulated cells in promoting the interaction between HIF-1α and VHL. Together, these results suggest that M1-AchR signaling regulates HIF-1α hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and/or proteasomal degradation. However, the effect of mAchR signaling on HIF-1α accumulation is not explained fully by the stabilization mechanism, because the effect on the half-life of HIF-1α is much less that that induced by DFX (Fig. 5B). We have reported that certain growth factors such as IGF-1 (12Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 13Fukuda R. Hirota K. Fan F. Jung Y.D. Ellis L.M. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar), and the nitric oxide donor NOC18 increase the rate of HIF-1α protein synthesis rather than increasing the stability of HIF-1α. The pulse-labeling data (Fig. 5C) indicate that mAchR stimulation also increases the rate of HIF-1α synthesis. The dual effects on both synthesis and stability account for the high levels of HIF-1α induced by mAchR signaling. Src family kinases are also activated by Gαq/Gα11-coupled receptors via the proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PKY2) (36Felsch J.S. Cachero T.G. Peralta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). v-Src and RasV12 signaling in RCC4 and 786–0 cells has been shown to stabilize HIF-1α by inhibiting hydroxylation of Pro-564 (37Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The effects of dominant negative forms of Ras and Rac1 (Fig. 8D) suggest that similar mechanisms may be involved in AchR-mediated HIF-1 activation. We demonstrate that the activation of HIF-1 in response to muscarinic signaling is suppressed by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. (Fig. 8). M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors stimulate phospholipase Cβ, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate the second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (34Caulfield M.P. Birdsall N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar) causing PKC activation. In fact, genistein or GF109203X inhibits M1-AchR-mediated HIF-1α accumulation. Taken together, the pathway may lead to HIF-1α accumulation (Fig. 9). Regulation of HIF-1 activity involves changes in both the protein expression and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α (8Jiang B.H.

Our data analyzing transactivation mediated by Gal4-HIF-1α-TAD fusion proteins demonstrate that muscarinic receptor signaling also induces HIF-1α TAD activity under non-hypoxic conditions. A major determinant of TAD function is the interaction between HIF-1α and the coactivators p300/CBP, which regulated by O2-dependent hydroxylation of Asn-803 by FIH-1 (7Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). TAD activity is also regulated by a MAPK-dependent mechanism (29Hirota K. Semenza G.L. J. Biol.

The MEK inhibitor PD98059, which is a selective pharmacologic inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK5, blocked muscarinic signal-induced HIF-1, suggesting a link between muscarinic signaling, MEK/ERK, and HIF-1α. The data presented in Fig. 8E suggest that MEK1 and MEK5 cooperatively play a critical role in this process. The signal transduction pathway leading from muscarinic receptor activation to HIF-1α TAD activation is also sensitive to the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The M1-M4 receptors are widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems (34Caulfield M.P. Birdsall N.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 279-290PubMed Google Scholar). The M1 receptor is found in greatest abundance in the cortex and hippocampus where it constitutes 40–50% of the total mAchR. Activation of HIF-1 may provide a mechanism to increase glucose uptake and/or perfusion in response to increased neuronal activity via increased transcription of genes encoding glucose transporters and angiogenic factors such as VEGF. In PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, HIF-1 serves as a neuroprotective factor against amyloid β peptide, which is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (40Soucek T. Cumming R. Dargusch R. Maher P. Schubert D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Notably, the M1 receptor is coupled with processing the amyloid precursor protein (41Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15850-15853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Finally, mice with a deletion of the HIF-1 binding site within the HRE of the Vegf gene develop motor neuron degeneration similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (42Oosthuyse B. Moons L.

Further studies are required to determine whether HIF-1 activation by muscarinic receptor signaling may play an important role in regulating cell survival in neurodegenerative disorders.

In an attempt to find which regions of these proteins are in close proximity to one another, we have constructed a tandem of cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP, respectively) linked by a 23-residue spacer, and measured the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of the tandem either in free solution or after attachment to sites of the α1S and β1a subunits of the DHPR. For all of the sites examined, attachment of the CFP-YFP tandem did not impair function of the DHPR as a Ca2+ channel or voltage sensor for excitation-contraction coupling. The free tandem displayed a 27.5% FRET efficiency, which decreased significantly after attachment to the DHPR subunits. At several sites examined for both α1S (N-terminal, proximal II-III loop of a two fragment construct) and β1a (C-terminal), the FRET efficiency was similar after expression in either dysgenic (α1S-null) or dyspedic (RyR1-null) myotubes. However, compared with dysgenic myotubes, the FRET efficiency in dyspedic myotubes increased from 9.9 to 16.7% for CFP-YFP attached to the N-terminal of β1a, and from 9.5 to 16.8% for CFP-YFP at the C-terminal of α1S. Thus, the tandem reporter suggests that the C terminus of α1S and the N terminus of β1a may be in close proximity to the ryanodine receptor.

The dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) is a voltage-gated calcium channel consisting of a principal α1S subunit and the auxiliary subunits α2-δ, β1a, and γ (1Campbell K.P. Leung A.T. Sharp A.H. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 425-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Catterall W.A. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. J. Biol.

The ryanodine receptor is a calcium release channel composed of four identical subunits (4Fleischer S. Inui M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). One argument for conformational coupling between the DHPR and RyR1 is that depolarization of the plasma membrane elicits calcium release from the SR without the requirement for entry of extracellular Ca2+ (5Rios E. Ma J.J. Gonzalez A. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1991; 12: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to this orthograde signal from the DHPR to RyR1, there is also a retrograde signal whereby RyR1 increases the magnitude of the Ca2+ current via the DHPR (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Morphological evidence strongly supports the idea that this bidirectional signaling involves physical links (direct or indirect) between DHPRs and RyRs in skeletal muscle. In particular, freeze-fracture images of the plasma membrane at junctions with the SR reveal clusters of intramembranous particles that appear to represent DHPRs arranged in groups of four (tetrads) such that each DHPR is apposed to a subunit of an RyR (7Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2587-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Additionally, this arrangement of DHPRs requires the presence of RyR1 because the arrangement of clustered particles into tetrads does not occur in dyspedic (RyR1-lacking) myotubes (8Takekura H. Nishi M. Noda T. Takeshima H. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether, and at what sites, interactions occur between the DHPR and RyR1, a number of different approaches have been utilized. This work has yielded no consistent picture. As one example, application of peptides corresponding to α1S(II-III) loop residues 671-690 was found to activate isolated RyRs (9el-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol.

A. 2002; 99: 10167-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As another example, biochemical studies found that the α1S(II-III) and (III-IV) loops interact with residues 954-1112 of RyR1 but not with the corresponding RyR2 residues (17Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, analysis of RyR chimeras revealed that replacing RyR1 residues 1-1634 with those of RyR2 has little effect on bidirectional signaling (18Nakai J. Sekiguchi N. Rando T.A. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13403-13406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other biochemical studies showed an interaction between RyR1 residues 3609 and 3643 and the proximal portion (1393-1527) of the α1S C-terminal (19Sencer S. Papineni R.V. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if this interaction actually occurs in vivo, it cannot be a sole determinant of skeletal-type EC coupling because replacing the II-III loop of α1C with that of α1S is sufficient to convert EC coupling from cardiac-type (Ca2+-entry dependent) to skeletal-type, independent of the identity (cardiac versus skeletal) of the C-terminal (20Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Indeed, a subset of α1S residues (720-765) in the II-III loop have been shown to be both critical for bidirectional signaling (21Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and to interact very weakly with RyR1 residues 1837-2168 in yeast two-hybrid studies (22Proenza C. O'Brien J. Nakai J. Mukherjee S. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6530-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, this interaction also seems unlikely to be the sole determinant of skeletal type coupling because (i) strong coupling is mediated in dyspedic myotubes by a chimera in which RyR1 residues 1645-2154 are replaced by RyR2 residues 1637-2118 (22Proenza C. O'Brien J. Nakai J. Mukherjee S. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6530-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and (ii) weak skeletal-type coupling can be produced in dysgenic myotubes by an α1S lacking residues 720-765 as long as a segment of upstream sequence (671-690, peptide A) is also removed (15Ahern C.A. Bhattacharya D. Mortenson L. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3294-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to the α1S(II-III) loop, a role for the β1a C-terminal has been suggested from analyses of β cDNA constructs expressed in β1-null myotubes (23Gregg R.G. Messing A. Strube C. Beurg M. Moss R. Behan M. Sukhareva M. Haynes S. Powell J.A. Coronado R. Powers P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13961-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Beurg M. Ahern C.A. Vallejo P. Conklin M.W. Powers P.A. Gregg R.G. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2953-2967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, preliminary biochemical studies have suggested that β1a binds to RyR1 in vitro (25Cheng W. Coronado R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 109aGoogle Scholar). In evaluating the various results described above, one must take into account the limitations of each of the approaches. In the case of the biochemical and peptide experiments, it is possible that regions of the DHPR and RyR are artificially brought into contact with one another in a manner that cannot occur in vivo. In the case of the expression of cDNAs encoding DHPRs and RyRs, the observation that function is altered by changes introduced into a segment of primary sequence does not reveal whether that segment actually represents a site of intermolecular contact. Thus, we have undertaken a new approach in the attempt to obtain information about the molecular architecture of DHPRs and RyRs within plasma membrane-SR junctions of living muscle cells. This approach makes use of fluorescent resonant energy transfer (FRET) between donor and acceptor fluorophores (ECFP and EYFP in the present experiments) (26Siegel R.M. Chan F.K. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/PL1)PubMed Google Scholar). FRET is an appropriate tool for analyzing the disposition of donors and acceptors that are separated by distances (∼10 nm or less) that are relevant for interacting proteins in vivo (27dos Remedios C.G. Moens P.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 115: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition to being very sensitive to donor-acceptor separation, FRET efficiency is also affected by the relative orientation of the donor and acceptor moieties (28van der Meer B.W. J. Biotechnol. 2002; 82: 181-196PubMed Google Scholar). We have engineered cDNAs in which a CFP-YFP tandem has been incorporated at varying positions of α1S and β1a. This approach allows one to determine whether the FRET differs for the CFP-YFP tandem attached to these sites from the FRET of the free CFP-YFP tandem. At all sites examined, FRET efficiency was reduced when the tandem was attached to the DHPR subunits within junctional membranes. Comparison of FRET efficiency after expression in dysgenic and dyspedic myotubes allowed determination of whether RyR1 influenced the environment of the attachment sites. Interestingly, the presence of RyR1 did not affect the FRET signal of the CFP-YFP tandem attached to the C-terminal of β1a, the N-terminal of α1S, or the II-III loop of two-fragment α1S constructs. By contrast, the FRET efficiency of the tandem attached either to the N-terminal of β1a or the truncated C-terminal of α1S was significantly reduced by the presence of RyR1. Thus, the tandem reporter suggests that RyR1 may be in close proximity to these two sites of the DHPR. In the accompanying article (29Lorenzon N.M. Haarmann C.S. Norris E.E. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44057-44064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we describe another approach for probing the topology of junctions. CFP-YFP Tandem—Fig. 1 shows the CFP-YFP constructs used in the experiments described here. The mammalian expression vectors pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were cut at unique restriction sites (MfeI and XmaI for pECFP-C1, AgeI and MfeI for pEYFP-N1). The 4.6-kb MfeI-XmaI fragment was then ligated to the 0.8-kb AgeI-MfeI fragment via the compatible overhangs of XmaI and AgeI to create the CFP-YFP expression vector, in which the coding sequences for CFP and YFP were connected by a 69-base pair (bp) linker (23 amino acids). YFP-labeled Rabbit Skeletal Muscle α1S—The coding sequence for rabbit skeletal muscle α1S (GenBank™ number M23919) was excised from its original vector (30Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using a SalI site immediately before the ATG start codon and a SalI site that had been introduced via mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at nucleotide 5581 (immediately after amino acid 1860 of α1S, where 1873 is full-length). The SalI-SalI fragment containing the α1S coding sequence was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the SalI-digested pEYFP-C1 (or pEYFPN1) to create constructs encoding the N- and C-terminal labeled fusion proteins YFP-α1S and α1S-YFP, respectively (these constructs contained a KpnI site 6 and 10 nucleotides, respectively, downstream from the end of the α1S coding sequence). Restriction digests and sequencing were used to verify these constructs. Unlabeled α1S—To provide an unlabeled α1S construct with an expression level comparable with that of the fluorescently labeled subunits, α1S-YFP was digested with KpnI and MfeI (unique sites), and the small fragment containing the YFP sequence was discarded. The large fragment containing the α1S coding sequence was closed by ligating it to the 126-bp fragment of pEYFP-C1 that had been digested with the same enzymes. CFP-YFP-α1S—To label the N-terminal of α1S with the CFP-YFP tandem, the AgeI-XmaI fragment of pECFP-C1 (containing the CFP encoding sequence) was ligated to YFP-α1S that had been opened with an AgeI cut proximal to the YFP coding sequence. In this construct, a 15-residue linker connected the tandem to the first α1S residue. α1Sshort-CFP-YFP—To label the C-terminal of α1S, a second KpnI site was introduced into α1S-YFP by PCR mutagenesis to change the wild-type α1S sequence 4999AATGTTGCC to 4999AAGGTACC. After digestion with KpnI to remove the sequence coding for the distal part of the α1S C-terminal, the plasmid was re-ligated to yield a cDNA encoding α1S with a truncated C-terminal (“α1S-(1-1667)”). The YFP sequence was then replaced by the CFP-YFP tandem sequence by cutting both α1S-(1-1667)-YFP and the CFP-YFP plasmid with AgeI and MfeI and ligating the fragment containing α1S-(1-1667) to the one carrying the CFP-YFP sequence, giving α1S-(1-1667)-CFP-YFP (=α1Sshort-CFP-YFP). In this protein, α1S was attached to the tandem via a 12-residue linker. Two-Fragment α1S-labeled with CFP-YFP—One plasmid (“α1S(I-II)CFP-YFP”) contained the coding sequence for residues 1-671 of rabbit α1S (including repeats I and II together with a small portion of the II-III loop), followed by an 11-residue linker and the CFP-YFP sequence. The second plasmid (“α1S(III-IV)”) encoded residues 686-1860 (including a large part of the cytoplasmic II-III loop in addition to repeats III and IV). To make α1S(I-II)-CFP-YFP, a second KpnI site was introduced into YFP-α1S at a position corresponding to Ser672 of α1S. The mutated plasmid was then cut with KpnI to remove the sequence coding for α1S residues 672-1860 and re-ligated. The resulting YFP-α1S-(1-671) was digested with BamHI and PshAI to yield a 1,142-bp fragment containing the sequence for α1S residues 1-671, which was ligated to the 6,389-bp fragment of the BamHI/PshAI-digested α1S-(1-1667)-CFP-YFP to obtain α1S(I-II)-CFP-YFP. The α1S(III-IV) expression vector was constructed by using PCR mutagenesis to introduce a HindIII just upstream of the ATG codon for Met686 into the coding sequence of expression vector for unlabeled α1S (described above). The plasmid was digested with HindIII, which cut both at this introduced site and a second already present upstream of the first ATG of α1S, and then re-ligated. α1S(I-II)-CFP-YFP-(III-IV)—This construct encodes α1S residues 1-671, followed by the CFP-YFP tandem, followed by α1S residues 686-1860 (α1S-(1-671), 11 residue linker, CFP-YFP, 12 residue linker, α1S-(686-1860)). The plasmid was made by first opening the α1S(III-IV) construct (see above) with NheI and HindIII at the multiple cloning region preceding the α1S coding sequence and introducing the EYFP coding sequence to obtain YFP-α1S(III-IV). The ECFP coding sequence was then added to this plasmid by opening YFP-α1S(III-IV) proximal to the EYFP coding sequence with NheI and AgeI and inserting the NheI-XmaI fragment obtained upon digestion of ECFP-C1. The resulting CFP-YFP-α1S(III-IV) was then cut with AgeI and MfeI, and the 5.2-kb fragment encompassing the CFP-YFP-α1S(III-IV) sequence was finally subcloned into α1S(I-II)-CFP-YFP that had been treated with AgeI and MfeI to remove CFP-YFP. CFP-YFP-labeled Rabbit β1a Subunit—The coding sequence for rabbit skeletal muscle β1a (GenBank™ number M25514) was isolated by using PCR to introduce EcoRI and SalI sites immediately before the ATG start codon and immediately after the last codon, respectively. The EcoRI-SalI segment containing the β1a coding sequence was then ligated to EcoRI/SalI-digested pEYFP-C1 or pEYFP-N1 to obtain the intermediate constructs YFP-β1a and β1a-YFP, respectively. CFP-YFP-β1a was made by cutting YFP-β1a with AgeI and ligating it with the fragment containing the CFP sequence of AgeI/XmaI-digested pECFP-C1 (a 12-residue linker connected CFP-YFP to β1a). β1a-CFP-YFP (with a 13-residue linker connecting β1a to CFP-YFP) was created by first removing the YFP sequence from β1a-YFP via AgeI and DraIII cuts and then ligating the fragment containing the β1a sequence to a fragment containing the CFP-YFP sequence, obtained by digestion of the CFP-YFP tandem with the same enzymes. Correct orientation of the sequences was checked with appropriate restriction digests. Unlabeled Rabbit β1a Subunit—To provide an unlabeled β1a construct with an expression level comparable with that of the fluorescently labeled subunits, β1a-YFP was digested with Acc651 and BsrGI (unique sites) and the small fragment containing the YFP sequence was discarded. The large fragment containing the β1a coding sequence was closed by ligation. Primary cultures of dysgenic (31Knudson C.M. Chaudhari N. Sharp A.H. Powell J.A. Beam K.G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 283-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, myoblasts were plated into 35-mm culture dishes with collagen-coated glass coverslip bottoms (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and grown for 6-7 days in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, was then replaced by differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum), and after 2-4 days single nuclei of myotubes were microinjected with a small amount of plasmid DNA in water. The DNA concentration in the injection solution was 10 ng/μl for both the CFP-YFP tandem and the β1a constructs, and 50-80 ng/μl for the α1S constructs. These same concentrations were used for each of the individual plasmids when combinations of plasmids were injected. For the measurement of Ca2+ currents, the injected cDNA concentration was 20 ng/μl for all the β1a constructs and 100 ng/μl for all the α1S constructs except for the two fragment construct: 60 ng/μl for α1S(I-II)-CFP-YFP, and 100 ng/μl for α1S(III-IV). Myotubes expressing unlabeled α1S or β1a were usually identified by co-injection of 10 or 2 ng/μl, respectively, of a cDNA expression plasmid encoding EYFP. The ability of the α1S and β1a constructs to support EC coupling in dysgenic or β1-null myotubes, respectively, was assayed by the presence of spontaneous contractions and/or evoked contractions. To test for evoked contractions, the myotubes were placed in physiological saline (containing in mm: 140 NaCl, 1.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 11 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH) and stimulated via 100-V, 30-ms pulses applied via a patch pipette that contained physiological saline and was positioned near the myotube. Macroscopic Ca2+ currents were measured with the whole cell patch clamp method (33Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes of borosilicate glass had resistances of 2-3.5 MΩ when filled with an intracellular solution containing (mm): 140 CsCl, 5 MgCl2, 10 Cs2EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with CsOH. The external bath solution contained (mm): 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium-C1, 0.003 tetrodotoxin, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with tetraethylammonium-OH. To measure the L-type current, myotubes were stepped from the holding potential (-80 mV) to -20 mV for 1 s (to inactivate endogenous T-type current), repolarized to -50 mV for 50-100 ms, depolarized to varying test potentials (Vtest) for 200 ms, repolarized to -50 mV for 100 ms, and then returned to the holding potential. Test currents were corrected for linear components of leak and capacitive current by digitally scaling and subtracting the average of 11 control currents elicited by a hyperpolarizing step to -110 mV delivered from the holding potential prior to each test pulse. Cell capacitance was determined by integration of a transient from -80 to -70 mV using Clampex 8.0 (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA) and was used to normalize current amplitudes (pA/pF). Current-voltage (I-V) curves were fitted using the following Boltzmann expression,I=Gmax*(V−Vrev)/{1+exp[−(V−V1/2)/kG]}(Eq. 1) where I is the current for the test potential V, Vrev is the reversal potential, Gmax is the maximum Ca2+ channel conductance, V½ is the half-maximal activation potential, and kG is the slope factor. Intact fluorescent myotubes were examined 24-48 h after cDNA microinjection using the confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510 META (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). With physiological saline, spontaneous contractions occurred in a large fraction of dysgenic myotubes expressing the α1S constructs and in β1-null myotubes expressing β1a constructs. Because such contractions would interfere with analysis of FRET, the contractions were eliminated by bathing the cells in a Ca2+/Mg2+-free saline (containing in mm: 155 NaCl, 5 KCl, 11 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH). Based on measurements of steady-state inactivation of sodium currents (100-ms prepulses), this solution appeared to shift the effective transmembrane potential by at least +25 mV (not shown). An area of 500 to 2500 μm2 was selected from the field of view (×63 oil objective, 1.4 NA), which included the part of the myotube to be analyzed and also an adjacent, non-cellular region for measurement of background fluorescence. CFP and YFP were excited with separate sweeps of the 458- and 514-nm lines, respectively, of an argon laser (30-milliwatt maximum output, operated at 50% or 6.3A) directed to the cell via a 458/514 nm dual dichroic mirror. The emitted fluorescence was split via a 515-nm long-pass, and for CFP was directed to a photomultiplier equipped with a 465-495-nm bandpass filter (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) and for YFP was directed to a photomultiplier equipped with a 530-nm long-pass filter. With this arrangement, there was no cross-talk between the CFP and YFP fluorescence because CFP is not excited at 514 nm and because YFP does not emit in the 465-495 nm range. Confocal fluorescence intensity data (ICFPpre and IYFPpre) were recorded as the average of four line scans per pixel and digitized at 8-bits, with photomultiplier gain adjusted such that maximum pixel intensities were no more than ∼70% saturated (particularly for CFP, which increased in intensity after photobleaching of YFP). Repeated scans (20Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar-60) with 514 nm at maximum laser intensity (20-100-fold greater than for image capture) were used to photobleach YFP, which required ∼30-120 s at maximal scan rates. After completion of YFP bleaching, fluorescence intensity (ICFPpost and IYFPpost) was measured using the identical parameters as before bleaching. FRET efficiency (E) in percent (%) was calculated as,E=(ICFPpost−ICFPpreICFPpost)×100%(Eq. 2) where ICFPpre and ICFPpost are the background corrected CFP fluorescence intensities before and after photobleaching YFP, respectively. In most cases, the constructs tagged with the CFP-YFP tandem were localized in many, spatially separated foci localized near the cell surface. For such constructs, it was important to calculate the FRET efficiency only for pixels contained in these foci. For this purpose, we used the software package “3D for LSM” (Zeiss), which allows the construction of a binary mask with the value of unity for all pixel intensities within a user-specified range and a value of zero elsewhere. The software then allows calculations based on only those pixels of the original images corresponding to the positions having the value of unity in the mask. We used this software to produce a digital mask from the YFP image prior to photobleaching (Fig. 6). With the mask, a “CFP-difference image,” which corresponded to the numerator of Equation 2, was calculated by subtracting pixel-by-pixel the background-corrected intensities prior to bleaching (ICFPpre) from those after bleaching (ICFPpost). Finally, the FRET efficiency was calculated by dividing the sum of all the pixel intensities for the CFP difference image by the sum of all the pixel intensities of the background-corrected post-bleach CFP image (ICFPpost). At times, slight movements of the cells during the measurements, along with a small variability of the scan-head, made it necessary to slightly shift the ICFPpost image to obtain perfect overlap with ICFPpre for analysis. Statistical comparisons were made on the basis of the unpaired t test. FRET Efficiency of the Free CFP-YFP Tandem—Fig. 2 illustrates the method used to measure FRET efficiency, as applied to the CFP-YFP tandem expressed in a normal myotube. The two images on the left were obtained, respectively, for cyan fluorescence (in response to 458 nm excitation) and yellow fluorescence (in response to weak 514 nm excitation). Subsequently, the myotube was illuminated with repeated exposure to strong 514 nm excitation, which bleaches YFP but is not absorbed by CFP. Afterward, the cyan and yellow fluorescence were measured again using the same conditions as prior to the bleaching episode. Because of the essentially complete bleaching of YFP, the fluorescence intensity of the donor (CFP) increased as a consequence of the loss of the resonant energy to the acceptor (YFP). Measured in this way, the average FRET efficiency (E) for the CFP-YFP tandem was 27.5 ± 2.5% (n = 11 cells). In principle, the FRET efficiency determined for the CFP-YFP tandem coul"
https://openalex.org/W2017807760,"N-oligosaccharides of Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycoproteins are classified as core and mannan types. The former contain 13–14 mannoses whereas mannan-type structures consist of an inner core extended with an outer chain of up to 200–300 mannoses, a process known as hyperglycosylation. The selection of substrates for hyperglycosylation poses a theoretical and practical question. To identify hyperglycosylation determinants, we have analyzed the influence of the second amino acid (Xaa) of the sequon in this process using the major exoglucanase as a model. Our results indicate that negatively charged amino acids inhibit hyperglycosylation, whereas positively charged counterparts promote it. On the basis of the tridimensional structure of Exg1, we propose that Xaa influences the orientation of the inner core making it accessible to mannan polymerase I in the appropriate position for the addition of α-1,6-mannoses. The presence of Glu in the Xaa of the second sequon of the native exoglucanase suggests that negative selection may drive evolution of these sites. However, a comparison of invertases secreted by S. cerevisiae and Pichia anomala suggests that hyperglycosylation signals are also subjected to positive selection.

Protein glycosylation in eukaryotic cells is thought to play an essential role in many processes such as protein folding and transport, maintenance of protein and cell structure, and cell recognition and adhesion, as well as other functions. From the several types of protein glycosylation, N-glycosylation has received a great deal of attention not only because of its high frequency but also because several biochemical steps involved in this biosynthetic process are shared by yeast and humans, an indication that they have been conserved throughout evolution. These conserved steps occur in the membrane (i) or the lumen (ii and iii) of the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; endo H, endoglicosidase H; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Exg1, exoglucanase. and belong to three groups: (i) assembly of the precursor oligosaccharide, GlnNAc2-Man9Glc3 on a lipid carrier (dolichol-PP), (ii) transfer of the oligosaccharide to the nascent or recently synthesized protein acceptor, and (iii) trimming of the three glucoses and one mannose (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Orlean P. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar and 2Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, once the glycoprotein leaves the ER, biochemical modification by trimming and/or addition of new sugars varies enormously between species and even between individual proteins of the same cell. This suggests that individual proteins carry the precise information for the final carbohydrate composition. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, some of the protein-attached oligosaccharides leaving the ER (GlcNAc2-Man8) are poorly elongated with up to 13–14 mannoses (core-type), whereas many others are further elongated by the addition of an outer chain of up to 200 mannose residues in the Golgi apparatus (mannan-type), a process commonly known as hyperglycosylation. The outer chain consists of a backbone of α-1,6-mannoses with α-1,2 branches that are decorated with terminal α-1,3-mannose residues (1Orlean P. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 229-362Google Scholar, 3Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 440-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of this complex is carried out by the ordered addition of mannoses in at least five biochemically defined steps (4Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26836-26843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Jungmann J. Munro S.

In S. cerevisiae, intracellular glycoproteins carry core-type oligosaccharides, whereas most extracellular glycoproteins carry outer chain-elongated structures. This suggests that hyperglycosylation may protect protein molecules from environmental constraints. It is well established that oligosaccharides are transferred from a lipid donor to specific asparagines in the tripeptide Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr), where Xaa is any amino acid except proline (8Marshall R.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1974; 40: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bause E. Lehle L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 101: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Bause E. Biochem.

However, the structural principles that govern the frequency of glycosylation of the different sequons still are a matter of controversy. A survey of the N-linked sites has indicated that Thr functions better than Ser in this process (13Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Similarly, studies on glycosylation of the rabies virus glycoprotein have indicated that Ser containing sequons were poorly glycosylated in vitro relative to a similar series of sequons containing Thr in the third position (14Kasturi L. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14756-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Also, work with yeast invertase showed that of the two overlapping sequons 4 and 5 of the protein (Asn92-Asn93-Thr94-Ser95), the first one (Thr) was almost completely glycosylated, but the second (Ser) was barely glycosylated, if at all (15Reddy V.A. Johnson R.S. Biemann K. Williams R.S. Ziegler F.D. Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a change in the tetrapeptide from NNTS to NNSS enabled both sequons to be glycosylated (16Reddy A. Gibbs B.S. Liu Y.L. Coward J.K. Changchien L.M. Maley F. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the 100% glycosylation frequency in vivo of the Ser containing sequons present in the major yeast exoglucanase (Exg1) indicates that other parameters may have caused the bias in favor of Thr in the above mentioned studies or may have influenced our results (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Vázquez de Aldana C. Larriba G. Yeast. 1993; 9: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Additional studies in vitro again using the rabies virus glycoprotein as a model have indicated that introduction of specific amino acids, such as Trp, Asp, Glu, or Leu, in the X position convert the sequon to a poor oligosaccharide acceptor (18Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 19Kasturi L. Chen H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Whereas studies on the identification of the structural features that influence the degree of occupation of a sequon are scarce and controversial, no attempts have been reported to specifically characterize hyperglycosylation. Gene fusions between either carboxypeptidase Y or proteinase A and invertase suggest that the proteases bear dominant signals that suppress hyperglycosylation of the invertase domain present in the fusion protein (20Johnson L.M. Bankaitis V.A. Emr S.D. Cell. 1987; 48: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 21Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify determinants that regulate the extension of the N-oligosaccharide elongation, we have analyzed the effect of sequon composition on this process. Analysis of most extracellular glycoproteins is a difficult task. For this reason, we have used S. cerevisiae Exg1, an extracellular protein amenable to study that has been well characterized in our laboratory. Exg1 is classified in family 5 of glycosyl hydrolases (22Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). In vivo Exg1 glycosylation yields several glycoforms. One of these, Exg1b, contains 12% carbohydrate distributed into two short oligosaccharides, each consisting of a regular inner core whose outer chain is reduced to two or three residues of mannose, indicating that the α-1,6-mannose added by Och1 is capped by a stop-signal α-1,2-mannose, which may be elongated with a terminal α-1,3-mannose (23Hernandez L.M. Olivero I. Alvarado E. Larriba G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9823-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These oligosaccharides are attached to both potential glycosylation sites (Asn165-Asn166-Ser167 and Asn325-Glu326-Ser327) present in the polypeptide (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Vázquez de Aldana C. Larriba G. Yeast. 1993; 9: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Vázquez de Aldana C.R. Correa J. San Segundo P. Bueno A. Nebreda A.R. Méndez E. del Rey F. Gene. 1991; 97: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Exg325 and Exg165 carry a single oligosaccharide attached to the second (Asn325) and the first (Asn165) glycosylation sites, respectively (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Vázquez de Aldana C. Larriba G. Yeast. 1993; 9: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Exg1a contains 30–40% carbohydrate and forms smears in SDS-acrylamide gels as do other heavily glycosylated yeast glycoproteins (i.e. invertase, acid phosphatase), and its synthesis is prevented in mutant mnn9. Analysis of glycosylation mutants has indicated that only the second oligosaccharide of Exg1b can be elongated to generate Exg1a, an indication that it should be more accessible than the first one to the α-1,6-mannosyltransferase that elongates the outer chain (25Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Olivero I. Andaluz E. del Rey F. Larriba G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this article we describe the effect of sequon composition, in particular the influence of the second amino acid of the tripeptide sequence (X) in the hyperglycosylation of Exg1, and we provide a structure-based hypothesis to explain our results. For this purpose, we have constructed mutated versions of the EXG1 gene in which the two sequons of the protein have been systematically mutated. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Wild type S. cerevisiae TD28 (MATaura3–52 ino1–11 canr) and its Δexg1 derivative, CV55, have been described before (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M.

S. cerevisiae YS57–5A (MATα, och1::LEU2 leu2 ura3 his1 his3) and S. cerevisiae BFY 109–1C (MATacan1–100 ade2–1 his3–11,-15 leu2–3,-112 trp1–1 ura3–1 kex2Δ::HIS3A) were kindly provided by Drs. Y. Jigami and R. Fuller, respectively. Yeast cells were maintained in YEPD medium (2% glucose, 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone). For the production of external exoglucanase, cells were grown at 28 °C in liquid minimal medium supplemented with amino acids (26Hernandez L.M. Ramirez M. Olivero I. Larriba G. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) until the middle exponential phase of growth. Plasmid Constructs—Centromeric plasmids carrying the EXG1 gene in pRS316 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (pRB1) and its derivatives in which the first (pRB2, EXG10E), the second (pRB3, EXG1N0), or both (pRB4, EXG100) sequons were eliminated by substituting the corresponding Asn by Gln have been described before (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Vázquez de Aldana C. Larriba G. Yeast. 1993; 9: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All possible combinations between the X amino acids of the first and second sequons of Exg1 were performed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene). First, using pRB1 as a template, a SalI/XbaI mutated fragment that included the first site as NES was obtained. It was then used to replace its counterpart in pRB1 and pRB4 to generate EXGEE and EXGE0, respectively. Similarly, a KpnI/ClaI mutated fragment including the second site as NNS was used to generate EXGNN and EXG0N from pRB1 and pRB4, respectively. Finally, EXGEN was obtained by introducing the SalI/XbaI mutated fragment into EXG0N. In a second set of experiments, we constructed all the possible variants of the second glycosylation site by introducing each one of other 19 amino acids (except proline) in the X position. For that purpose, the KpnI/NaeI fragment was amplified by PCR using suitable oligonucleotides that carry the appropriate mutation, and the resulting product was used to replace its counterpart in EXG00. All of the mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Purification and Characterization of Exg1—Culture supernatants obtained by centrifugation of cells were concentrated and dialyzed using Amicon PM10 membranes and/or Centricon filters. Purification of the different glycoforms of exoglucanase was carried out by ion exchange chromatography column (TSK gel DEAE-5PW, 7.5 mm × 7.5 cm, TosoHaas). Exoglucanase activity was determined using p-nitrophenol-β-d-glucopyranoside as a substrate (26Hernandez L.M. Ramirez M. Olivero I. Larriba G. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 146: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed as reported (28Cueva R. Munoz M.D. Andaluz E. Basco R.D. Larriba G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using peroxidase to develop color. Standard deglycosylation reactions using endo H were carried out as described (25Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Olivero I. Andaluz E. del Rey F. Larriba G. Biochem.

Exg1 Structure Analysis—Crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae exo-1,3-β-exoglucanase has been determined recently (29Taylor S.C. Ferguson A.D. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank accession code 1H4P). Protein structure was analyzed with a Swiss-Model and Swiss-Pdb Viewer (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar, 31Guex N. Diemand A.

Analysis of the Exg1 Glycoforms Secreted by S. cerevisiae Expressing Mutated Versions of EXG1 with Altered Sequon Composition—Wild type EXG1 or each one of the EXG1 constructs carrying all possible combinations of the first and second sequons was cloned in the centromeric plasmid PRS316 (27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These clones were then used to transform strain CV55 (Δexg1), and the transformants were grown at 28 °C for 15 h. The supernatant fluids, dialyzed and concentrated, were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography (HPLC). A summary of the nature and amount of the several glycoforms secreted by ectopic wild type EXG1 and glycosylation mutants is shown in Table I. Wild type EXG1 showed the typical profile, a minor and heterogeneous peak (Exg1a, 10%) preceded a major and sharp one (Exg1b, 90%) (Fig. 1A, panel a). Glycosylation mutants in which one sequon had been eliminated also yielded the expected results. Thus, mutant N0 only generated Exg165, whereas mutant 0E yielded an Exg1a-like glycoform and Exg325. Western blot analysis of Exg1b, Exg165, and Exg325 confirmed the nature of these forms indicating that the length of the short oligosaccharides attached to the modified sites was not significantly altered (Fig. 2). When the second sequon was eliminated (N325Q) and the first one was constructed NES (notice that this corresponds to the second sequon in native Exg1) (form E0), an Exg165-like enzyme was secreted indicating that the change introduced in the amino acid X of the first sequon (Asn to Glu) does not modify the elongation properties of the attached oligosaccharide. However, when the first sequon was eliminated (N165Q) and the second one was NNS (notice that Asn corresponds to the first sequon in native Exg1) (form 0N), only about 70% of the activity eluted as an Exg325-like form, whereas the residual 30% eluted as two peaks in the Exg1a region (Table I and Fig. 1A, panel c). This result suggested that the presence of Asn instead of Glu in the X residue of the second sequon increases the probabilities for elongation of the attached oligosaccharide. We should emphasize that because purified Exg1a and Exg1b have the same specific activity (32Ramírez M. Hernández L.M. Larriba G. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 151: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the enzymatic activity exhibited by each glycoform can be taken as a good estimation of the amount of the associated Exg1p (see also below).Table IA summary of the nature and amount of the Exg1p glycoforms secreted by the indicated glycosylation mutantsExg1 variantFirst sequonSecond sequonAssociated glycoformsExgNENNSNESExg1a (10%) + Exg1bExgEENESNESExg1a (10%) + Exg1bExgNNNNSNNSExg1a (30%) + Exg1bExgENNESNNSExg1a (30%) + Exg1bExgE0NESQESExg165-likeExg0NQNSNNSExg1a-like (30%) + Exg325ExgN0NNSQESExg165Exg0EQNSNESExgla-like (10%) + Exg325Exg00QNSQESNone Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Time course deglycosylation of the hyperglycosylated variant produced by construct NN.A, analysis in HPLC.

Thus, the EE construct (both sequons are identical to the second sequon of the wild type exoglucanase) generated an exoglucanase complement indistinguishable from the wild type counterpart by both HPLC (Fig. 1A) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), indicating that the presence of Glu instead Asn at the X position of the first sequon does not alter the glycosylation pattern of wild type Exg1. On the other hand, the EN construct (both sequons exchange their positions) yielded two peaks in the Exg1a region (30%) and one eluting as Exg1b (70%) (Table I and Fig. 1A, panel b), the latter being further characterized by Western blotting as a form carrying two short oligosaccharides (Fig. 2). Finally, mutant NN (both sequons are identical to the first sequon of wild type exoglucanase) behaved as its EN counterpart (Table I and Fig. 2). Therefore, in all three constructs carrying Asn at the X position of the second sequon (0N, EN, and NN), there is a significant increase in the amount of exoglucanase activity in the Exg1a region (30%) as compared with wild type (10%) (Fig. 1A). The absence of subglycosylated and/or non-glycosylated forms in transformants expressing wild type EXG1 or mutant constructs with two glycosylation sites as well as the absence of non-glycosylated Exg in transformants carrying constructs N0, 0E, E0, and 0N indicates that the transfer of oligosaccharides is very efficient and that there is enough lipid-linked oligosaccharide available to occupy all the sites offered by the nascent exoglucanase during its translocation into the lumen of the ER. It should be noticed that regardless of their position in the molecule the QES sequon is always efficiently core-glycosylated. This contrasts with the results obtained with a variant of the rabies virus glycoprotein, which have indicated that the presence of Glu at the X position is associated with inefficient core glycosylation (18Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and suggests that other protein signals must also control this process. Characterization of the Hyperglycosylated Forms from ON, EN, and NN Constructs—Although mutant exoglucanases eluting in the ExgIa region seem to correspond to hyperglycosylated forms, the fact that an immature form of exoglucanase (form A) also elutes in this region prompted us to distinguish these possibilities. Form A is an endoplasmic reticulum form of Exg1 carrying a 21-amino acid propeptide; it is converted to mature form in the Golgi apparatus by elimination of the propeptide by the Kex2 protease (33Basco R.D. Giménez-Gallego G. Larriba G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Basco R.D. Cueva R. Andaluz E. Larriba G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although Exg1a and form A co-eluted in HPLC, their deglycosylated products have quite different retention times. As shown in Fig. 1A (top of graph), following treatment with endo H, authentic form A is converted into a deglycosylated product eluting in HPLC as native ExgIb (fraction 19), whereas authentic form B yields a much more acidic compound (fraction 30). Similarly, after treatment with endo H, Exg1a from construct EN was quantitatively converted into a form undistinguishable from deglycosylated ExgIb. The absence of deglycosylated form A indicates that all of the exoglucanase eluting in the Exg1a region is indeed mature and hyperglycosylated. The same was true for the Exg1a-like counterparts generated by constructs EE and NN. As expected, deglycosylation of the Exg1a-like form generated by construct 0N yielded a product that co-eluted with the deglycosylated product of the Exg325-like exoglucanase generated by the same construct. These biochemical data were also supported by genetic evidence. Oligosaccharides from glycoproteins secreted by mutant Δoch1 are unable to elongate the inner core, but the protein portion of susceptible substrates (α factor or Exg1) are normally processed; accordingly, this mutant only secretes an Exg1b-like form with no traces of ExgIa. YS57–5A cells (Δoch1) transformed with the EN construct exclusively secreted Exg1b. Because the Δoch1 mutation does not prevent secretion of form A in a Δkex2 mutant (data not shown), we conclude that the Exg1a-like enzymes under study do not correspond to form A, but instead they behave as hyperglycosylated forms of mature exoglucanase. In agreement with its hyperglycosylated nature, all of the Exg1a-like forms yielded by constructs NN, EN, and 0N smeared when analyzed in SDS-PAGE where they exhibited a similar molecular size (Fig. 1C, panel a). Obviously, the absence of the first short oligosaccharide (Mr 3000) in the 0N constructs is not enough to introduce detectable differences in the upper size limit. This observation indicates that the absence of the first oligosaccharide does not influence the degree of elongation of the second. It should also be noted that hyperglycosylated forms derived from constructs EN, NN, and 0N elute clearly into two peaks, a property that we have extended now to wild type Exg1a where it was not as evident because of the low levels of this glycoform. Interestingly, as shown for the construct 0N (Fig. 1C, panel b), the Exg1 molecules included in peak 1 have an average size larger than their counterparts from peak 2, indicating that in the former the oligosaccharide attached to the second site carries a more elongated outer chain. Although the precise origin and nature of these differences is under study, they likely are derived from different rounds of action of mannan polymerase I, mannan polymerase II, or both. To further investigate the nature of the Exg1a-like enzyme secreted by NN and EN transformants, we purified the whole hyperglycosylated fraction by preparative HPLC and subjected it to treatment with endo H. The results were highly reproducible and almost identical for both transformants; accordingly, we will present only those results from construct NN. Time course deglycosylation was followed by both ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2A) and Western blots (Fig. 2B). The deglycosylation kinetics in terms of the enzymatic activity associated with the several glycoforms (Exg1a, peak 1 and peak 2; Exg1b, subglycosylated and unglycosylated Exg1) is shown in Fig. 2C. The following conclusions can be derived. (i) As expected, the hyperglycosylated exoglucanase was quantitatively transformed into deglycosylated Exg1, which carries one GlcNAc attached to each sequon. The absence of more acidic products indicates that all the sequons of the hyperglycosylated molecules carried oligosaccharides. The final product of the reaction, deglycosylated Exg1, was also detected in Western blots as a 47-kDa band. (ii) A deglycosylation intermediate (fraction 27) is produced during the first stages of the deglycosylation reaction. Then, its levels decreased, and it was no longer visible after the levels of the substrate dropped to one-half. This intermediate eluted in the same position as the glycoform with a short oligosaccharide in the first position and a single GlcNAc in the second one and was also identified in the same samples by Western blots as a 50-kDa band; these features make it indistinguishable from the second intermediate detected during the deglycosylation of Exg1b (17Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Vázquez de Aldana C. Larriba G. Yeast. 1993; 9: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation is that the intermediate arises from the hyperglycosylated forms by elimination of the elongated residue. The levels of this intermediate are always very low because the endoglycosidase has more affinity for the oligosaccharide attached to the first position in such a way that not only it is produced at low levels, but it is also immediately transformed into deglycosylated enzyme (25Basco R.D. Hernández L.M. Muñoz M.D. Olivero I. Andaluz E. del Rey F. Larriba G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). (iii) Both peaks of the hyperglycosylated region behaved similarly, although the deglycosylation kinetics of peak 1 was slightly faster. The preference of endo H for the first (short) oligosaccharide suggests the generation of an abundant intermediate carrying the elongated oligosaccharide attached to the second sequon. This intermediate could not be detected in the chromatograms indicating that its elution time is similar that of its precursor. Deglycosylation of the Exg1a-like enzyme from the 0N transformant yielded similar results, except that there were no traces of the small intermediate (see Fig. 2). These results unambiguously demonstrate that the mutant glycoforms eluting in the Exg1a area in the HPLC column truly correspond to hyperglycosylated exoglucanase. Therefore, we conclude that substitution of Glu by Asn at the X position of the second sequon significantly increases the hyperglycosylation efficiency. Analysis of the Hyperglycosylation of Exg1 Variants with Amino Acid Substitution at the X Position of Sequon 2—To further analyze how hyperglycosylation is affected by the nature of the second amino acid of the sequon, we systematically changed the amino acid at position X of the second glycosylation site. To facilitate the analysis, these constructs were placed in a context in which the first glycosylation site had been eliminated (N165Q). As shown in Fig. 3A, analysis of the secreted Exg1 glycoforms derived from the new constructs indicated the presence of a substantial amount (up to 57%) of hyperglycosylated Exg1 when the"

By inhibiting FGFR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and/or Ras downstream events, Sef inhibits FGF-mediated ERK activation and cell proliferation as well as PC12 cell differentiation. Here we show that Sef and a deletion mutant of Sef lacking the extracellular domain (SefIC) physically interact with TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-associated kinase) and activate JNK through a TAK1-MKK4-JNK pathway. Sef and SefIC overexpression also resulted in apoptotic cell death, while dominant negative forms of MKK4 and TAK1 blocked Sef-mediated JNK activation and attendant 293T cell apoptosis. These investigations reveal a novel activating function of Sef that is distinct from its inhibitory effect on FGF receptor signaling and ERK activation.

Dysregulation of RTK signaling is associated with human diseases including cancer, skeletal dwarfism, and craniosynostosis, thus RTK signaling must be tightly regulated (3Robertson S.C. Tynan J.

Within the Ras-MAPK pathway, several feedback inhibitors have recently been identified and include members of the Sprouty and SPRED (Sprouty-related EVH1-domain containing) families of polypeptides (6Dikic I.

Sef (similar expression to fgf genes), also called IL-17R-D, is a newly identified feedback inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling and encodes a type I transmembrane domain protein that is highly conserved in zebrafish, mouse, and humans (9Tsang M.

Sef has been proposed to inhibit ERK activation in NIH3T3 cells by physically interacting with the FGFR1 and decreasing its tyrosine phosphorylation (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K.

Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, a splice variant of Sef has been identified that gives rise to a cytoplasmic form of Sef that likewise associates with FGFR1 and inhibits ERK activation (15Preger E. Ziv I. Shabtay A.

In this study, we show that ectopic expression of Sef activates c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and apoptosis. We also present evidence that Sef activates JNK through a TAK1-MKK4-JNK pathway and that TAK1 associates with Sef in co-immunoprecipitated complexes. These studies demonstrate for the first time the multifunctional potential of this FGFR and ERK modulating protein as a mediator of JNK and apoptosis. Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies to FLAG and β-actin were from Sigma. The V5 monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. Antibodies to JNK, phospho-JNK, c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, MKK4, phospho-MKK4, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were from Cell Signaling and antibodies to His, HA, and TAK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SYTOX Green was from Molecular Probes and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Constructs—All Sef constructs were in pcDNA3.1-V5/His and have been described previously (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Dominant negative MKK4 (dn-MKK4), dominant negative FLAG-tagged TAK1 (dn-TAK1), dominant negative HA-tagged MEKK1 (dn-MEKK1), and dominant negative HA-tagged ASK1 (dn-ASK1) were provide by Dr. Hongbing Shu (National Jewish Medical Center, Denver, CO). Cell Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection experiments were carried out using the Genejuice™ reagent (Novagen) as described previously (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24–36 h after transfection by lysis in HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaVO4). Lysates were either subjected directly to immunoblot analysis or immunoprecipitated overnight with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered with protein-A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed in HNTG buffer, and subjected to immunoblotting procedures as described previously (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cell Death Assays—293T cells were transiently transfected with mSef expression plasmids and at 36 h were stained with 1 μm SYTOX Green dye and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Apoptosis was quantified by calculating the percentage of fluorescence-positive (dead) cells as determined by flow cytometry. Fluorescence positive cells were also visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70), and fluorescent digital images were merged with digitized phase contrast images. Overexpression studies of full-length mSef and Sef subdomains revealed that mSef and mSefIC (intracellular and transmembrane domain), but not mSefECTM (extracellular and transmembrane domain), induced apoptotic cell death in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1, a and b). SYTOX Green staining, a measure of cell death, increased almost 6-fold in 293T cells overexpressing Sef or SefIC but not SefECTM. Similar results were obtained by AnnexinV staining of Sef-transfected cells (data not shown). In part, this result may be partially explained by our previous observation that mSef inhibits FGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, and Akt phosphorylation is known to inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanisms of mSef-mediated cell death in 293T cells, PARP cleavage was assayed. PARP is a nuclear DNA repair protein that is cleaved by caspase into two subunits rendering it inactive (16Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Konopleva M. Zhao S. Xie Z. Segall H. Younes A. Claxton D.F. Estrov Z. Kornblau S.M. Andreeff M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of cells transfected with mSef or mSefIC displayed elevated levels of cleaved PARP, whereas cells transfected with mSefECTM or vector control did not (Fig. 1c). Immunoblotting experiments also revealed that overexpression of Sef and SefIC resulted in caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1d), data that parallel PARP cleavage in that activated caspase-3 has been shown to mediate PARP cleavage (16Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 17Konopleva M. Zhao S. Xie Z. Segall H. Younes A. Claxton D.F. Estrov Z. Kornblau S.M. Andreeff M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the above SYTOX Green staining results (Fig. 1, a and b) and indicate that ectopic expression of mSef and mSefIC results in apoptotic cell death. Data also indicate that this pro-apoptotic activity likely is mediated by the Sef cytoplasmic domain. Studies in several systems indicate that JNK plays an essential role in apoptosis and this may be mediated by phosphorylation of c-Jun, as well as other targets (18Kennedy N.J. Davis R.J. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). To determine whether JNK activation is involved in mSef-induced cell death of 293T cells we performed immunoblot analysis of cell lysates from mSef-, mSefIC-, and mSefECTM-transfected 293T cells using phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun specific antibodies (Fig. 2). JNK and c-Jun, one of its immediate downstream targets, were phosphorylated in 293T cells transfected with mSef and mSefIC but not by mSefECTM or vector controls (Fig. 2, a–c). These data suggest a role for JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation in mSef-mediated apoptosis. To determine whether JNK phosphorylation by ectopic expression of mSef or mSefIC was unique to 293T cells, we also injected Xenopus embryos with mRNAs encoding mSef, mSefIC, or mSefECTM (Fig. 2d). Immunoblot analyses of lysates from gastrula stage embryos overexpressing mSef, mSefIC, or mSefECTM consistently demonstrated that mSef and mSefIC, but not mSefECTM, induce JNK phosphorylation in Xenopus embryos in a manner similar to that of 293T cells. These data indicate that JNK activation by ectopically expressed mSef or mSefIC is not unique to 293T cells. JNK is activated by multiple signaling pathways including MAP kinase kinase kinases ASK, MEKK1, and TAK1 (19Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). These in turn activate MKK4 and/or MMK7 to mediate JNK activation. In addition, Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 GTPases modulate JNK activity. Therefore, we employed dominant negative forms of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 to determine whether any of these effector proteins might act as intermediates in Sef-mediated JNK activation. Co-transfection of dominant negative Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42 with Sef or SefIC, however, had no effect on Sef-mediated JNK activation (data not shown). We next examined the potential involvement of MKK4 as an immediate upstream activator of JNK. Co-transfection of 293T cells with mSef and increasing amounts of a dn-MKK4 expression vector revealed dn-MKK4 dose-dependent inhibition of mSef-mediated JNK phosphorylation (Fig 3a). Co-expression of the dn-MKK4 with mSef also resulted in inhibition of mSef-mediated phosphorylation of c-Jun. Since dn-MKK4 is able to inhibit mSef-mediated JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation we also tested whether dn-MKK4 might also rescue mSef-mediated apoptosis. SYTOX Green staining of 293T cells co-transfected with mSef and dominant negative MKK4 revealed dn-MKK4-dependent decreases in SYTOX Green staining in a dose-response manner consistent with the notion that inhibition of mSef-mediated JNK activation rescues cells, at least partially, from apoptosis (Fig. 3b). The lack of a full rescue from apoptosis by overexpression of dn-MKK4 suggests that there may be additional pathways activated by mSef that also induce apoptosis. Alternatively, the relative stoichiometry of dn-MKK4 to mSef may be unfavorable for a complete rescue from the apoptotic effect. To confirm that MKK4 is indeed involved in this pathway we also examined whether MKK4 was phosphorylated in response to forced expression of Sef, SefIC, or Sef ECTM. Immunoblot analysis indicates that endogenous MKK4 is phosphorylated by overexpression of Sef or SefIC but not by SefECTM (Fig. 3c). These data are consistent with MKK4 acting downstream of Sef and upstream of JNK. Since several kinases act as upstream activators of MKK4 we tested dominant negative forms of several of these including ASK1, MEKK1, and TAK1 (18Kennedy N.J. Davis R.J. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 199-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). dn-TAK1, but not dn-ASK1 or dn-MEKK1, inhibited mSef-mediated JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 3d). SYTOX Green staining of 293T cells co-transfected with mSef and increasing amounts of dn-TAK1 revealed that dn-TAK1 partially rescues cells from mSef-mediated apoptosis (data not shown). Like dn-MKK4, dn-TAK1-mediated rescue from apoptosis is incomplete, and this may reflect activation of additional apoptotic pathways by overexpression of Sef or SefIC. Taken together, these results are consistent with Sef-mediating apoptosis via a TAK1-MKK4-JNK pathway. TAK1 has also been implicated in activation of the p38 MAPK pathway (19Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of 293T cell lysates transfected with Sef or SefIC with phospho-p38 antibodies showed no increase in p38 phosphorylation above control empty vector transfected cell lysates (data not shown). This indicates that ectopic expression of Sef activates MKK4 via TAK1 resulting in JNK but not p38 activation. Since the mechanism by which mSef mediates JNK activation and apoptosis is not known, we sought to determine whether Sef associates with any of the components of the TAK1-MKK4-JNK pathway. Co-transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that TAK1 associates with mSef and mSefIC but not mSefECTM, and this is consistent with the role of the cytoplasmic domain of mSef as a mediator of JNK activation and apoptosis (Fig. 4, a and b). To confirm this interaction, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from mSef, mSefIC, or mSefECTM transfected cells with anti-TAK1 antibodies were performed and revealed that mSef and mSefIC also interact with endogenous TAK1 (Fig. 4c). Overall, the present studies suggest that Sef is a multifunctional protein whose first function was identified as that of an inhibitor of FGF signaling (9Tsang M. Dawid I.B.

Several studies show that Sef inhibits FGF-induced ERK activation, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains in doubt (9Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Scienc's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2282004pe17)PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that Sef inhibits FGF-mediated activation of FGFR1 that inhibits all downstream signaling from the receptor in NIH3T3 cells (14Kovalenko D. Yang X. Nadeau R.J. Harkins L.K. Friesel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14087-14091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Another study shows that Sef inhibits FGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation upstream of Ras (20Xiong S. Zhao Q. Rong Z. Huang G. Huang Y. Chen P. Zhang S. Liu L. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50273-50282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), presumably by an interaction with FGFR1. However, an alternate mechanism has been proposed by evidence that suggests that Sef acts downstream of Ras at the level of MEK (10Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Komuves L.G. Gerritsen M.E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the present study we show that mSef when overexpressed in 293T cells induces JNK activation and apoptosis, indicating that mSef has a function in addition to inhibiting FGF-mediated ERK activation (9Tsang M. Dawid I.B. Scienc's STKE. 2004; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;stke.2282004pe17)PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that Sef-mediated apoptosis occurs, at least in part, via a Sef-TAK1-MKK4-JNK pathway. The mechanism by which mSef activates TAK1 remains to be determined, although recently hSef has been shown to forms homodimers (10Yang R.B. Ng C.K. Wasserman S.M. Komuves L.G. Gerritsen M.E. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33232-33238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this might promote association of Sef with TAK1. Furthermore, while we have demonstrated that mSef co-immunoprecipitates with epitope-tagged TAK1 and endogenous TAK1, we cannot exclude the possibility that an additional protein or proteins may be required for the formation or stabilization of this complex. Additional studies will elucidate the mechanism by which mSef induces JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis and the conditions required for this activation.

https://openalex.org/W2018071620,"The transient outward K+ current (Ito) modulates transmembrane Ca2+ influx into cardiomyocytes, which, in turn, might act on Ito. Here, we investigated whether Ca2+ modifies functional expression of Ito. Whole-cell Ito were recorded using the patch clamp technique in single right ventricular myocytes isolated from adult rats and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a serum-free medium containing various Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]o). Increasing the [Ca2+]o from 0.5 to 1.0 and 2.5 mm produced a gradual decrease in Ito density without change in current kinetics. Quantitativereverse transcriptase-PCR showed that a decrease of the Kv4.2 mRNA could account for this decrease. In the acetoxymethyl ester form of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA-AM)-loaded myocytes (a permeant Ca2+ chelator), Ito density increased significantly when cells were exposed for 24 h to either 1 or 2.5 mm [Ca2+]o. Moreover, 24-h exposure to the Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K8644, in 1 mm [Ca2+]o induced a decrease in Ito density, whereas the Ca2+ channel antagonist, nifedipine, blunted Ito decrease in 2.5 mm [Ca2+]o. The decrease of Ito in 2.5 mm [Ca2+]o was also prevented by co-incubation with either the calmodulin inhibitor W7 or the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 or cyclosporin A. Furthermore, in myocytes incubated for 24 h with 2.5 mm [Ca2+]o, calcineurin activity was significantly increased compared with 1 mm [Ca2+]o. Our data suggest that modulation of [Ca2+]i via L-type Ca2+ channels, which appears to involve the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin, down-regulates the functional expression of Ito. This effect might be involved in many physiological and pathological modulations of Ito channel expression in cardiac cells, as well other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2153912626,"The ataxin-1 interacting ubiquitin-like protein (A1Up) contains an amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (UbL) region, four stress-inducible, heat shock chaperonin-binding motifs (STI1), and an ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) at the carboxyl terminus of A1Up. Although proteins that have both an UbL and UBA domain are thought to play a crucial role in proteasome-mediated activities, few are characterized, except for hHR23A/B. Similar to other UbL-containing proteins, the UbL of A1Up is essential for the interaction of A1Up with the S5a subunit of the 19S proteasome. Importantly, the interaction with the 19S proteasome was disrupted in the presence of the polyglutamine repeat protein, ataxin-1. The UbL domain of A1Up is ubiquitinated by both Lys48-linked and Lys63-linked chains. Intact A1Up is stable, suggesting that ubiquitination of A1Up is important for degradation-independent targeting of A1Up to the 19S proteasome. The UBA domain of A1Up binds polyubiquitin chains and has a role in the stability of A1Up and in the subcellular localization of A1Up. When the UBA domain was deleted, the localization of A1Up was entirely cytoplasmic, and it co-localized with the proteasome. Interestingly, the interaction between A1Up and mutant ataxin-1-(82Q) increased the half-life of A1Up, whereas nonpathogenic wild-type ataxin-1-(30Q) or ataxin-1-(82Q)-A776 did not.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) 1The abbreviations used are: SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1; HA, hemagglutinin; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PLIC, proteasome ligation interacting component; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by motor deterioration and loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. SCA1 is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat tract in the SCA1 gene that results in an abnormally long polyglutamine tract within the protein. Thus, SCA1 is one of nine characterized polyglutamine repeat diseases; the other eight are spinocerebellar ataxias 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17; dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy; Huntington's disease; and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (1Zoghbi H.Y.

Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1441-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Accumulation of mutant ataxin-1 into nuclear inclusions is a hallmark of disease. These nuclear inclusions stain positive for components of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and chaperones (3Cummings C.J. Mancini M.A. Antalffy B. DeFranco D.B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The role these nuclear inclusions play in pathogenesis is complex. Data suggest that nuclear inclusions represent a cellular response to protect against the expanded polyglutamine, but whether sequestration of normal proteins into the inclusions contributes to the pathology of SCA1 remains to be determined (4Ciechanover A. Brundin P. Neuron. 2003; 40: 427-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Recently, ataxin-1 was reported to be phosphorylated at serine 776, and mutation of this serine to an alanine decreased the ability of mutant ataxin-1-(82Q) to form nuclear inclusions (5Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H. Aitken A. Skoulakis E.M. Orr H.T. Botas J. Zoghbi H.Y.

In contrast, when transgenic animals overexpressing mutant ataxin-1-(82Q) were crossed with animals lacking the E3 ligase, E6AP (Ube3A gene), there was also a decrease in nuclear inclusions, but there was increased disease pathology (7Cummings C.J.

These latter experiments suggest that modifications of ataxin-1 and modulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system in SCA1 are both critical for pathogenesis. Previously, a two-hybrid screen was performed in search of ataxin-1 binding partners. From this screen, ataxin-1 interacting ubiquitin-like protein (A1Up) was identified (8Davidson J.D. Riley B. Burright E.N. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A1Up belongs to the UbL-UBA family of proteins that have a ubiquitin moiety fused to their amino terminus (ubiquitin-like domain, UbL) and a carboxyl terminus ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) (9Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Studies of the amino-terminal UbL family of proteins, such as hHR23A/B, hPLIC1/2, Dsk-2, BAG-1, and Parkin, have demonstrated that the UbL domain of these proteins was capable of binding to the 19S proteasome, more specifically, to the polyubiquitin receptor Rpn10/S5a subunit (10Hiyama H.

Another subunit of the proteasome, Rpn1, has also been shown to bind to the UbL domain of the yeast homolog of hHR23, Rad23 (15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B.

The residues in hPLIC-1 shown to be critical for interaction of hPLIC-1 with the Rpn10/S5a subunit of the proteasome are Ile79, Ala81, Ile84, Val105, and Ile106 (11Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutagenesis studies showed that Thr9 and Ile49 in the UbL of hHR23A bind to S5a (16Walters K.J. Lech P.J. Goh A.M. Wang Q. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The 26S proteasome consists of the 20S core that contains the catalytic activity and the 19S regulatory particle that controls entry of ubiquitinated substrates into the 20S. The 19S subunit can associate with one or both ends of the 20S core particle. The 18-subunit 19S particle can be further divided into a base, which contains the AAA-ATPases (regulatory particle triple A proteins, Rpts 1–6), the non-ATPase regulatory particle proteins (Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn10), and a lid that is comprised of non-ATPases (Rpn 3–13) (9Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Rpn10/S5a, part of the base, can also bind to the lid and is thought to stabilize the interaction between the base and lid (9Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rpn10/S5a is the only proteasome subunit that can be found in large abundance disassociated from the intact proteasome (18van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that excess free Rpn10/S5a can inhibit proteasome degradation by sequestering polyubiquitinated substrates from reaching the proteasome (9Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar, 19Deveraux Q. van Nocker S. Mahaffey D. Vierstra R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

Rpn10/S5a has been shown to bind monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin through the ubiquitin-interacting motifs of Rpn10/S5a, with preference for the latter (10Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K.

Polyubiquitin chains consisting of four Lys48-linked ubiquitins function as the canonical degradation signal, and Rpn10/S5a binds these chains primarily through hydrophobic interactions (9Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar, 11Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, Rpn10/S5a has also been shown to bind Lys6 and Lys11 chains with equal affinity to Lys48 chains (21Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The exact role of these linkages has not been studied in depth; however, in the case of the UbL protein BAG-1, Lys11 chain formation facilitates degradation-independent targeting of BAG-1 to the proteasome by association with Rpn10/S5a (22Alberti S. Demand J. Esser C. Emmerich N. Schild H. Hohfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45920-45927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Rpn10 is nonessential in yeast, suggesting that more than one factor is involved in recognition and delivery of polyubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome (18van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M.

The UbL-UBA proteins were hypothesized to be “shuttle factors” capable of delivering polyubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome via polyubiquitin chain binding through their UBA domain and subsequent Rpn10/S5a binding via their UbL domain (12Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 15Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S.

However, recent findings contradict this shuttle hypothesis. Overexpression of UbL-UBA proteins inhibits the degradation of model substrates in yeast rather than stimulating their degradation (12Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Ortolan T.G.

Furthermore, overexpression of UbL-UBA proteins is toxic to yeast and results in an accumulation of high molecular mass ubiquitin species (12Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc.

UbL-UBA proteins have also been shown to exert stabilizing effects; however, the exact means by which this occurs has not been determined. It has been hypothesized to be the result of one or more of the following: sequestering Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains; blocking access of deubiquitinating enzymes to polyubiquitin chains; capping monoubiquitin chains; and inhibiting ubiquitin chain assembly (24Chen L.

Here we show that the ability of A1Up to interact with S5a, the subcellular localization of A1Up, and the half-life of A1Up all depend on the integrity of the UbL and UBA domains of A1Up. We show that A1Up has the ability to stabilize a specific substrate in vivo, namely, ataxin-1, and that the ability of A1Up to stabilize ataxin-1 is dependent on the polyglutamine length of ataxin-1.

Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), ΔUbL, and ΔUBA were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The primers for ΔUbL, residues 115–700, were 5′-cggaattcctgcttcttccccctccac-3′ and 5′-cggaattcgctgtctcatctccctcttc-3′. The primer to construct ΔUBA (residues 1–600) was 5′-cggaattccacctgtgagtttcgacttcca-3′.

Expression plasmids for pCMV4-HA-E6AP and pCMV4-HA-E6AP (C833A) were kindly provided by Dr. Peter M. Howley (35Talis A.L. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect E6AP and E6AP (C833A). Ubiquitylated proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal antibody (clone FK2; Affiniti, UK). The antibody used to immunoprecipitate ataxin-1 was 11NQ (32Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The 20S proteasome was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody to 20S α/β subunits (Affiniti, UK). Cell Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Native Electrophoresis—COS-1 cells were plated the day before transfection at 5 × 106 cells/60-mm plate. The following day, the cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty-four or 48 h later, the proteasome was inhibited using clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (20 μm; Boston Biochemicals) by treating transfected cells for 6–7 h. To harvest extracts under nondenaturing conditions, the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Biochemicals), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma) with rocking at 4 °C for 15 min. For immunoprecipitations under denaturing conditions, the cells were washed as described above but lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitors as described above, with rocking as described above (36Donaldson K.M.

All extracts were sheared with a 21-gauge needle (10 times), followed by a 25-gauge needle (4 times). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and nonspecific antibody of the same isotype (0.5 μg) for a time period ranging from 1 h to overnight at 4 °C on a rugged rotator, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 s at 4 °C. The protein concentration was then determined using protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Protein extract (500 μg), Xpress monoclonal antibody (1 μl; Invitrogen) or 11NQ (1–2 μl), and protein G (50 μl) were incubated at 4 °C on a rugged rotator for a time period ranging from 4 h to overnight. For native gel electrophoresis, COS-1 cells were transfected as described above, and cells were harvested in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Tris-glycine gels (6%, 8%, and 10%; Invitrogen) using Tris-glycine native running buffer (Invitrogen) were used for electrophoresis, and samples were prepared in Tris-glycine native sample buffer and loaded without heating (Invitrogen). To estimate molecular mass of unknowns, the high molecular mass calibration kit for native electrophoresis was used (Amersham Biosciences), and staining was performed with Ponceau Staining Solution (Sigma). Sigma technical bulletin MKR-137 was also used for reference using this procedure. Immunofluorescence—COS-1-1 cells were plated onto coverslips at 2 × 105 cells/6-well plate. The following day, they were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty-four to 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor as described above and then immunostained as described previously (32Skinner P.J. Koshy B.T. Cummings C.J. Klement I.A. Helin K. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nature. 1997; 389: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). A1Up, ΔUbL, and ΔUBA were visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody (1:100; Invitrogen). The 20S α and β subunits of the proteasome were detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-20S α/β antibody (1:2500; Affiniti, UK). Cells were incubated with three secondary antibodies: anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:100; Jackson Immunoresearch); anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to Alexa488 (1:100; Molecular Probes); and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1,000; Sigma) to visualize the nucleus for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were mounted onto slides, and analysis was performed using confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Binding Assays—Transfected COS-1 cells (48 h) were incubated (500 μg) with purified GST-S5a-agarose beads (30 μl; Affiniti, UK). The mixture was incubated overnight on the rotating wheel at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer, followed by one wash with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The agarose beads were then heated for 10 min at 70 °C in gel loading dye plus reducing agent (Invitrogen), subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellose, and Western blotted with monoclonal Xpress antibody or monoclonal S5a (Affiniti, UK), or the gels were stained with Simply Blue (Invitrogen) to determine total 19S/S5a in each lane. Pulse-Chase Experiments—COS-1 cells were transfected as indicated above (48 h). Metabolic labeling was carried out by first starving the cells in glutamine and methionine-free media supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine. One hour later, these media were removed, and the cells were pulsed in the same media containing 50 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine for 1 h. Cells were washed two times and incubated in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 180 μg/ml unlabeled methionine. Cells were then chased for various times and collected by washing two times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by cell lysis and immunoprecipitation as described above. The Ubl of A1Up Is Required for A1Up to Interact with the Proteasome—Examination of the sequence alignment of amino-terminal UbL domain-containing proteins with A1Up indicated that the residues responsible for the interaction with the proteasome are also conserved in the UbL of A1Up (11Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These correspond to residues Ile55, Ala57, Ile60, Val81, and Ile82 in A1Up. Furthermore, the residues confirmed by mutagenesis studies to be responsible for the interaction of the UbL domain with the Rpn10/S5a proteasomal subunit are also conserved in the UbL of A1Up and correspond to residues Thr9 and Ile55 (16Walters K.J. Lech P.J. Goh A.M. Wang Q. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 37Mueller T.D. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4634-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To characterize whether A1Up could interact with the proteasome, a series of deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 1A). The ability of these forms of A1Up to interact with the proteasome was examined by pull-down analyses of cellular extracts using purified 19S-(S5a)-GST agarose beads. Fig. 1B shows that an interaction with 19S/S5a was detected with either full-length A1Up or A1Up lacking the UBA (but only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor) (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). A1Up lacking the UbL domain did not interact with the 19S proteasome (Fig. 1B, lane 2). These results are consistent with a role of the UbL domain in mediating the interaction between A1Up and the proteasome. Besides detecting A1Up at 63.8 kDa, the monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody also detected a series of bands of increasing molecular mass of ∼10 kDa, suggestive of ubiquitin chain addition to A1Up (Fig. 1B, lane 1). To verify that these polypeptides were ubiquitin-modified A1Up, cellular extracts expressing A1Up and a HA-tagged ubiquitin were used in denaturing immunoprecipitations. Fig. 1C, lane 2 (asterisks) shows that A1Up was covalently modified by the addition of ubiquitin. Examination of the primary sequence of A1Up shows that the UbL domain is the only region that contains lysine residues and, thus, is capable of being ubiquitinated (8Davidson J.D. Riley B. Burright E.N. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the distinct high molecular mass bands reflecting the ubiquitination of A1Up (Fig. 1C, lane 2, asterisks) were not detected when the ΔUbL form was used (Fig. 1C, lane 3). However, we did not observe ubiquitination of A1Up lacking the UBA domain (Fig. 1B, lane 3; Fig. 1C, lane 4), suggesting that ubiquitination of A1Up requires both the UbL domain and UBA domain. To further characterize the ubiquitin chains, we utilized single-lysine mutants of HA-tagged ubiquitin that contain one lysine at residue 48 (Lys48) or at residue 63 (Lys63) with all other lysines residues mutated to arginine (33Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 34Wang C. Deng L. Hong M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). We observed polyubiquitination of A1Up in the presence of both of these single-lysine mutants, suggesting that Lys48 and Lys63 of ubiquitin are capable of supporting polyubiquitin chain formation on A1Up (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). There was a decrease in overall A1Up ubiquitination as compared with wild-type HA-ubiquitin in the presence of Ub(K48) or Ub(K63), suggesting that both Lys48- and Lys63-linked chains contribute to A1Up ubiquitination (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4 compared with lane 2). Overall, the data show that A1Up is covalently modified by formation of complex polyubiquitin chains involving linkages previously shown to be important for proteasome targeting and cellular signaling, and this promotes the interaction of A1Up with the S5a subunit of the 19S proteasome. Previous studies of the hHR23A protein showed that overexpression of the E3 ligase E6AP enhanced ubiquitin modification of hHR23A and that catalytically inactive (C833A) E6AP failed to promote ubiquitination of hHR23A (39Kumar S. Talis A.L. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To determine whether E6AP could also promote ubiquitination of A1Up, cellular extracts expressing A1Up and E6AP or the dominant negative E6AP (C833A) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Xpress antibody, and the level of A1Up ubiquitination was determined. E6AP and the mutant E6AP (C833A) did not affect the ability of A1Up to be ubiquitinated or the total levels of A1Up (Fig. 1E, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation of E6AP with A1Up was not detected (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that E6AP is not the E3 ligase responsible for the observed ubiquitination of A1Up. To investigate whether ataxin-1 affects the ability of A1Up to interact with the proteasome, the pull-down analysis with 19S-(S5a)-GST agarose beads was performed using cellular extracts expressing A1Up and either wild-type ataxin-1-(30Q) or mutant ataxin-1-(82Q). We also utilized the expanded ataxin-1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Ser776. Phosphorylation at Ser776 has been implicated in SCA1 pathogenesis and progression in transgenic animal models (5Chen H.K. Fernandez-Funez P. Acevedo S.F. Lam Y.C. Kaytor M.D. Fernandez M.H.

In addition, SR-BI has a variety of effects on plasma membrane properties including stimulation of the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (FC) between cells and HDL and changes in the organization of plasma membrane FC as indicated by increased susceptibility to exogenous cholesterol oxidase. Recent studies in SR-BI-deficient mice and in SR-BI-expressing Sf9 insect cells showed that SR-BI has significant effects on plasma membrane ultrastructure. The present study was designed to test the range of SR-BI effects in Sf9 insect cells that typically have very low cholesterol content and a different phospholipid profile compared with mammalian cells. The results showed that, as in mammalian cells, SR-BI expression increased HDL cholesteryl ester selective uptake, cellular cholesterol mass, FC efflux to HDL, and the sensitivity of membrane FC to cholesterol oxidase. These activities were diminished or absent upon expression of the related scavenger receptor CD36. Thus, SR-BI has fundamental effects on cholesterol flux and membrane properties that occur in cells of evolutionarily divergent origins. Profiling of phospholipid species by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry showed that scavenger receptor expression led to the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine species with longer mono- or polyunsaturated acyl chains. These changes would be expected to decrease phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol interactions and thereby enhance cholesterol desorption from the membrane.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These data strongly implicate SR-BI in the vascular wall, as well as in the liver, as a significant factor in suppressing atherosclerosis.In addition to changes in the flux of FC and CE, SR-BI has effects on plasma membrane properties that may contribute to the mechanisms of cholesterol movement into and out of the membrane (3Williams D.L. Connelly M.A. Temel R.E. Swarnakar S. Phillips M.C. de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For example, SR-BI expression increases the fraction of plasma membrane FC susceptible to oxidation by exogenous cholesterol oxidase (23de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakar S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and increases the size of the fast kinetic pool of membrane FC for efflux to cyclodextrin acceptors (33Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SR-BI alters the molecular packing of FC in such a way as to enhance FC desorption from the membrane. Additionally, SR-BI has significant effects on membrane morphology as evidenced by SR-BI –/– mice that have altered membrane ultrastructure and fail to form cell-surface microvillar channels on adrenal zona fasciculata cells (34Williams D.L. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 544-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to promoting cholesterol flux, SR-RI has multiple and, in some cases, dramatic effects on plasma membrane properties and structure.In the present study SR-BI was expressed in Sf9 insect cells to determine whether the varied effects of SR-BI seen in mammalian cells also occur in a cell that has membranes with a very different lipid composition. Compared with mammalian cells (35Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam2002: 449-482Google Scholar), Sf9 cells have reduced levels of sphingomyelin and elevated levels of phosphatidylethanolamine (36Gerbal M. Fournier P. Barry P. Mariller M. Odier F. Devauchelle G. Duonor-Cerutti M. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 2000; 36: 117-124Crossref Google Scholar, 37Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Additionally, even when grown in mammalian serum, plasma membranes of Sf9 cells have very low cholesterol content and a correspondingly low cholesterol to phospholipid ratio (37Marheineke K. Grunewald S. Christie W. Reilander H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 38Gimpl G. Klein U. Reilander H. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13794-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Reaven et al. (39Reaven E. Leers-Sucheta S. Nomoto A. Azhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that expression of SR-BI in insect Sf9 cells elicits the formation of double membrane structures that resemble the microvillar channels of steroidogenic tissues, indicating substantial changes in membrane morphology due to SR-BI. The present results show that, as in mammalian cells, SR-BI expression increased HDL CE-selective uptake, cellular cholesterol mass, FC efflux to HDL, and the sensitivity of membrane FC to cholesterol oxidase. These findings indicate that SR-BI has fundamental effects on cholesterol flux and membrane properties in cells of evolutionarily divergent origins with different lipid compositions. In addition, analysis of phospholipids by mass spectrometry showed substantial changes in phosphatidylcholine subspecies because of expression of SR-BI or the related class B scavenger receptor CD36.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Sequencing—PCR amplifications were performed by using a DNA Thermal Cycler 9700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oligo-nucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coral-ville, IA). Plasmids used to produce the murine SR-BI and rat CD36-expressing baculoviruses were constructed as follows. For construction of pFastBacI(SR-BI), primers 5′-GACCCAATTGGCGGCCGCCCGTCTCCTTCAGGTCCTGAGC-3′ and 5′-GACCAGATCTTCTAGAGCGGACAGGTGTGACATCTGG-3′ were employed to amplify the SR-BI coding region from a previously described vector, pSG5(SR-BI) (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were digested with MfeI and XbaI and were ligated into the pFastBacI vector (Invitrogen), which had been restricted previously with EcoRI and XbaI. For construction of pBakhis2A(CD36), the coding region of CD36 was restricted with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of pBakhis2A (Clontech). All plasmids were prepared using endotoxin-free maxi-prep kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced throughout the coding region to confirm that no point mutations had been generated during the cloning procedures (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Production of Recombinant Baculoviruses in Sf9 Cells—Sf9 cells (Spodoptera frugiperda) were routinely maintained in Grace's supplemented insect medium (Invitrogen) containing 5–10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in a 27 °C incubator. Baculoviral expression of SR-BI in the Sf9 cells was accomplished using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System as described by the vendor (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were harvested 72 h post-transfection and amplified three to four times by infection of Sf9 cells to produce high titer viral stocks.Immunoblot Analysis—Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells expressing SR-BI or CD36 (in 35-mm wells) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with 300 μl of Nonidet P-40 cell lysis buffer (41Rigotti A.

Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of cell lysate protein were analyzed by SDS-8% PAGE. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies directed to SR-BI (∼82 kDa) and CD36 (∼78 kDa) to confirm their expression in the Sf9 cells (44Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P. Drazul D.

Blots were also probed with antibody against the gp64 viral envelope protein (eBioscience).Preparation of 125I,3H-hHDL—Human (h) HDL3 (1.125 g/ml < ρ < 1.210 g/ml) (hereafter referred to as HDL) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (45Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6460) Google Scholar). HDL was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether ([3H]COE) or [3H]cholesteryl oleate ([3H]CE) (Amersham Biosciences) by using recombinant cholesteryl ester transfer protein as described (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M.

[3H]COE-HDL was labeled with 125I-dilactitol tyramine as described previously (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Particles were dialyzed versus four changes of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C under argon. The specific activity of the 125I,3H-HDL was 675 dpm/ng protein for 125I and 14 dpm/ng protein for [3H]COE.HDL Cell Association, Selective CE Uptake, and Apolipoprotein Degradation—Sf9 cells (1 × 106) were plated into 22-mm wells in growth medium and infected with 100 μl of high titer vector, SR-BI, or CD36 baculoviruses. Baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, 72 h post-infection, were washed once with serum-free medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin. 125I,3H-HDL particles were added at a concentration of 10 μg of protein/ml in serum-free medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and were incubated for 1.5 h at 27 °C. Values for cell-associated HDL apolipoprotein (expressed as HDL CE) and the selective uptake of HDL CE were obtained as described previously (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Cholesterol Efflux, Cholesterol Oxidase, and Cholesteryl Ester Hydrolysis Assays—Sf9 cells (1 × 106) were plated into 22-mm wells in growth medium at 27 °C and infected with 100 μl of high titer vector, SR-BI, or CD36 baculoviruses. After 48 h, cells were labeled for 18 h with 3 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Grace's insect medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed twice and equilibrated for 2 h in Grace's insect medium. [3H]Cholesterol efflux was measured after 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h at 27 °C in triplicate using HDL as an acceptor as described previously (23de la Llera-Moya M. Rothblat G.H. Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weibel G. Sakar S.W. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 575-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractional efflux values were corrected for the small amount of radioactivity released in the absence of HDL. Cholesterol oxidase assays were performed 72 h post-infection as described by Smart et al. (48Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and modified by Kellner-Weibel et al. (33Kellner-Weibel G. de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Stoudt G. Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For measurement of [3H]CE-HDL hydrolysis, at 72 h post-infection [3H]CE-HDL was added (10 μg of protein/ml) in DMEM containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the medium was removed, and the monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the distribution of 3H between FC and CE was determined (47Connelly M.A. Kellner-Weiber G. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Free and total cholesterol mass (and CE by difference) was measured at 72 h post-infection by gasliquid chromatography (49Klansek J.J. Yancey P. St. Clair R.W. Fischer R.T. Johnson W.J. Glick J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2261-2266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Phospholipid Analysis—Phospholipids were analyzed by nanospray electrospray ionization on a QuattroLC tandem mass spectrometer (50Brugger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Internal standards for PA (591 m/z, 28:0), PI (835 m/z, 34:1), PE (678 m/z, 28:0), PS (634 m/z, 28:0), SM (703 m/z, 32:1), and PC (678 m/z, 28:0) were purchased from Avanti. Standards (1 pm/μl) were sprayed from nanovials in 2:1 methanol and chloroform with the source maintained at 80 °C. A counter-current flow of nitrogen emerging around the cone (250 liters/h) was used to promote solvent evaporation from the sprayed droplets. A nanovial, loaded with 1 μl of standard or sample, produced a stable spray for more than 1 h allowing both survey mass spectra and daughter ion analysis for each lipid present. For CID experiments, argon was used in the collision cell. All CID parameters were optimized for each molecular ion in the positive and negative ion modes. Sf9 cells were lysed using nitrogen decompression, centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and debris, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g to collect membranes. Internal standards were added prior to lipid extraction. The membrane lipids were extracted in chloroform/methanol and dried under nitrogen. Samples were diluted 1:5,000 in methanol/chloroform (2:1) for analysis. A survey scan from m/z 600 to m/z 1000 (4 s) was taken to establish the phospholipid peaks present in each sample. Constant neutral loss and precursor ion scans were then performed using optimized conditions determined for each phospholipid as described (50Brugger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, fatty acyl tail composition was determined by tandem mass spectrometry analysis in the negative ion mode.For each phospholipid, the percent distribution of species with various acyl tail lengths was determined within each analysis based on the sum of the fatty acyl carbons in the sn-1 + sn-2 positions. Percent distributions from seven independent samples were then averaged. Statistical comparisons were made by a two-tailed Student's t test between pairs of the four treatment groups with correction made for multiple comparisons as indicated in the table legends. Determinations and analyses of the total double bonds in the fatty acyl chains of each phospholipid were done in the same fashion.RESULTSHDL Binding and Selective Uptake of Cholesteryl Ester in Sf9 Cells—To test whether binding of HDL to high affinity receptors will induce CE-selective uptake, Sf9 cells were infected with CD36, a class B scavenger receptor with 30% homology to SR-BI, or SR-BI baculovirus and binding studies were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1A shows that HDL binds to both CD36- and SR-BI-expressing Sf9 cells and confirms that both receptors were expressed on the cell surface. The apparent Kd values for HDL binding by CD36 and SR-BI were 37.2 and 19.2 μg/ml of HDL protein, respectively. Note that in this and other comparisons of SR-BI and CD36, Sf9 cells were infected with amounts of each virus that produced equivalent levels of HDL binding activity. The ability of SR-BI-expressing Sf9 cells to mediate selective HDL COE uptake has been demonstrated previously (39Reaven E. Leers-Sucheta S. Nomoto A. Azhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1B confirm that SR-BI-expressing cells mediate efficient and selective uptake of HDL COE and show that CD36-expressing cells do not. Most interestingly, the ability of CD36 to mediate HDL COE-selective uptake is markedly less than in mammalian cells in which CD36 has about 15% of the activity of SR-BI (40Connelly M.A. Klein S.M.

After confirming SR-BI expression and function at the plasma membrane, we tested for other activities shown by SR-BI in mammalian cells.Cholesterol Content of SR-BI-expressing Sf9 Cells—SR-BI expression in COS-7 and WI38 cells increases cellular cholesterol content of both free and esterified cholesterol (44Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M.

Because Sf9 cells typically have low cholesterol content, we tested whether SR-BI expression would alter cholesterol content. After 72 h of infection with either control, SR-BI, or CD36 baculovirus, cells were extracted, and their cholesterol content was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of SR-BI significantly increased the total cholesterol content of Sf9 cells including both free and esterified cholesterol, whereas uninfected cells contain only free cholesterol. Cells infected with control baculovirus or CD36 virus showed no change in free cholesterol although a small amount of esterified cholesterol was detected.Fig. 2Cholesterol content of cells expressing SR-BI and CD36 receptors. Sf9 cells expressing rat CD36, murine SR-BI, and uninfected control were prepared as described. Lipids were extracted, and cholesterol mass was determined by gas chromatography, normalized to cell protein, and expressed as μg of lipid/mg of cell protein. Values represent the mean of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The esterified cholesterol in SR-BI-expressing Sf9 cells is most likely derived from serum lipoproteins.

Two splice variants are differentially expressed along the nephron and have a differential influence on Na,K-ATPase when stably expressed in mammalian cells in culture. Here we used a combination of gene induction and gene silencing techniques to test the functional impact of γ by means other than transfection. NRK-52E cells (of proximal tubule origin) do not express γ as a protein under regular tissue culture conditions. However, when they were exposed to hyperosmotic medium, induction of only the γa splice variant was observed, which was accompanied by a reduction in the rate of cell division. Kinetic analysis of stable enzyme properties from control (α1β1) and hypertonicity-treated cultures (α1β1γa) revealed a significant reduction (up to 60%) of Na,K-ATPase activity measured under Vmax conditions with little or no change in the amounts of α1β1. This effect as well as the reduction in cell growth rate was practically abolished when γ expression was knocked down using specific small interfering RNA duplexes. Surprisingly, a similar induction of endogenous γa because of hypertonicity was seen in rat cell lines of other than renal origin: C6 (glioma), PC12 (pheochromocytoma), and L6 (myoblasts). Furthermore, exposure of NRK-52E cells to other stress inducers such as heat shock, exogenous oxidation, and chemical stress also resulted in a selective induction of γa. Taken together, the data imply that induction of γa may have adaptive value by being a part of a general cellular response to genotoxic stress.

Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous enzyme of mammalian cells that maintains the non-equilibrium distribution of Na+ and K+ ions against their electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane. The ability of cells to control Na,K-ATPase activity (in concert with other membrane components) is critical for responding to fluctuations in such factors as plasma ion concentrations, diet, water load, glomerular filtration rate, hormones that affect ion homeostasis (insulin, aldosterone, vasopressin, parathyroid hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide), and even diurnal cycles in urine production. The Na,K-ATPase has two obligatory subunits, a catalytic α subunit and a glycoprotein β (for review, see Ref. 1Kaplan J.H. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 51-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Regulation of the pump occurs at several levels: gene expression (long term regulation), recruitment/internalization of the active pumps to/from the plasma membrane, and modulation of ATPase activity (short term regulation) (for review, see Ref. 2Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the last few years evidence for a completely new mechanism of regulation of Na,K-ATPase has emerged; the intrinsic properties of Na,K-ATPase can be modulated by association with a small single span membrane protein belonging to the “FXYD” family (3Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Expression of the FXYD proteins is abundant in tissues that are involved in fluid and solute transport or that are electrically excitable (4Crambert G. Geering K.

Indeed, as shown from experiments with different expression systems, association of Na,K-ATPase with CHIF resulted in a significant increase in the affinity for intracellular Na+ and a decrease in the affinity for K+ (10Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanfano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Beguin P. Crambert G.

As for the γ subunit, a consensus has been reached that both splice variants modify enzyme properties notably by decreasing the affinity for Na+ (18Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D.

Interestingly, expression of splice variants of γ is also segment-specific (14Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both γa and γb are found in medullary thick ascending limb and in inner medulla (i.e. in the segments that are exposed to very different osmotic environments and fluctuations). On the contrary, γa and γb are individually expressed in cortical proximal tubules and distal convoluted tubules, respectively, which do not experience significant osmolarity shifts. Whether the expression profile reflects any specific needs for modulation of the ATPase activity remains to be determined. Although γ is abundantly expressed in kidney, expression of γ as a protein is absent in any renal derived established cell line (MDCK, mIMCD-3, LLC-PK1, HEK 293, and NRK-52E) under regular culture conditions (20Arystarkhova E.

A. 2001; 23: 3414-3419Google Scholar), thus facilitating the use of transfection as a primary tool to assess the functional role of γ and its splice forms (20Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as reported by Capasso et al. (22Capasso J.M. Rivard C. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 23: 3414-3419Google Scholar), both γa and γb can be induced in mIMCD-3 cells (a cell line derived from inner medullary collecting duct) with hypertonicity. Because both splice forms are found in inner medulla, where hypertonic conditions are the norm, this would suggest a potential tubule-specific control of γ gene expression. However, protein instability and DNA damage because of hypertonicity result in activation of a cellular stress response program, which includes cell growth arrest, initiation of DNA repair events, induction and/or activation of molecular chaperones, activation of the proteasome degradation pathways, and initiation of apoptosis. To assess whether induction of γ with hypertonicity is a part of a cellular response to stress, we used the NRK-52E cell line, originally derived from proximal tubule cells. NRK-52E cells were shown to have characteristics of energy metabolism similar to fresh isolated proximal tubule cells and primary cultures except with a lower content of brush border membranes (24Lash L.H. Putt D.A. Hueni S.E. Cao W. Xu F. Kulidjian S.J. Horwitz J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). What we found is that one of the splice variants, namely γa, indeed represents a stress-responsive protein, the induction of which is apparently required for downregulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in cellular adaptation to environmental changes, including osmotic stress, thermal stress, heavy metal stress, and oxidative stress. In addition the evidence is presented that changes in Na,K-ATPase activity in response to hypertonicity caused by association with the γ subunit are important for reduction in cell growth. Preliminary reports of this work have been presented previously (25Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Arystarkhova E. Sweadner K.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 43AGoogle Scholar, 26Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Membrane Preparations—Normal rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK-52E) were grown to 85–90% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (∼300 mosm). The medium was then replaced with either control or hyperosmotic (400–500 mosm total) medium supplemented with NaCl, urea, or sucrose. Other stress treatments were performed as specified in the figure legends. Flasks were harvested at various times, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with Ca2+ and Mg2+, and frozen at –80 °C. Crude membranes from the scraped cells were obtained by homogenization and differential centrifugation (20Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Isolation of membranes from rat kidney outer medulla was performed as described elsewhere (27Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Final purification of Na,K-ATPase was with SDS extraction, which leaves the Na,K-ATPase (including the γ subunit) in the lipid bilayer but removes a majority of contaminating proteins. Typical specific activity of Na,K-ATPase was about 50–150 μmol Pi/mg of protein/h in preparations from NRK-52E cells. C6 glioma, L6 myoblasts, and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (all purchased from the ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10% fetal bovine serum, or a combination of 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum, respectively. Crude membrane preparations were obtained as described above. Gels—Membrane fractions were resolved on Tricine-SDS 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NS, nonselective, nonspecific; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. gels (12.5% polyacrylamide). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were probed with specific antibodies. Detection was with chemiluminescence (Pierce). Monoclonal antibody McK1 (28Felsenfeld D.P. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10932-10942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or antiserum K1 (29Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect the α1 subunit. Polyclonal antiserum K3 was used for simultaneous detection of the α1 and β1 subunits (29Sweadner K.J. Gilkeson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RCT-G1 polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal peptide shared by γa and γb was used to detect both splice variants of γ (20Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The RNGB antibody (specific for the N terminus of γb) was used for γb detection (14Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using a Amersham Biosciences 300A analyzer. Na,K-ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured as a function of Na+ concentration in medium containing 3 mm Tris-ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4, with a fixed concentration of K+ (20 mm) as described elsewhere (8Arystarkhova E. Donnet C. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10162-10172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °C with and without 3 mm ouabain, and ouabain-sensitive Pi release was measured colorimetrically by the Fiske-Subbarow method. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression using the Sigma Plot graph system, version 4.01 (Jandel Scientific). siRNA Treatment—A target-specific 21-bp siRNA probe, AAUCCCUUCGAGUAUGACUdTdT, was selected from the coding region of γ shared by γa and γb(γ). The selected siRNA sequence was submitted for BLAST search to ensure that only one gene was targeted. The probes, including a non-selective (NS) sequence (UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUACUU), were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Dallas, TX). The day before transfection, cells were trypsinized and transferred into a medium without antibiotics. Transient transfection of siRNAs was performed with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) for 4–8 h; afterward the medium was aspirated and replaced with regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with l-glutamine and a penicillin/streptomycin mixture. In all experiments, cultures were transfected in parallel with target-specific siRNA duplexes and nonspecific duplexes at the same final concentration as the specific siRNA tested. After 24 h cells were exposed to hyperosmotic conditions (500 mosm with NaCl) for another 48 h, whereas control cells were left in isotonic medium. Alternatively, cells were treated with hypertonicity first for 24 h followed by siRNA treatment for another 48 h under continuous pressure of hypertonicity. Time and dose dependence of the siRNA treatment was evaluated experimentally by determining the reduction of γ de novo synthesis. The efficiency of gene silencing was confirmed by Western blots, and the ratio between γ and α staining (normalized to standards) was used as a criterion of knockdown. Cell Growth Rate—Cells were grown in 6-well plates with or without treatment (as indicated in the figure legends), harvested by trypsinization, and counted with a hemacytometer. Trypan blue exclusion was used as a criterion of cell viability. Immunofluorescence—Immunocytochemistry was performed as described elsewhere in more detail (13Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F531-F545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, treated or untreated cells were fixed with 4% periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature followed by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% goat serum to prevent nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies. McK1 antibody was used for α1 detection, whereas RCT-G1 (described above) or its monoclonal analog 11H11 was used to probe the γ subunit. The secondary antibodies were either Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Accurate, Westbury, NY) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Slides were examined with a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 scanning laser confocal system (version 3.2). Induction of γ by Hypertonicity—Fig. 1A shows that expression of γ indeed can be turned on in NRK-52E cells (which do not express the γ subunit under normal conditions) after 24 h of incubation in hyperosmotic medium supplemented with either sucrose or NaCl. Crude membrane preparations were tested on Western blots with antibodies specific for α1 and γ subunits. Although only small changes were detected in the amount of α1 (typical variations were within 14 ± 7% as compared with control), the level of γ expression was clearly dependent on osmolality and the type of osmolyte in the culture medium. Induction was much more pronounced in a medium supplemented with sucrose than with NaCl, and the level of induction was higher with 500 mosm than with 400 mosm medium in both cases. A higher level of osmolality (600–700 mosm) either with high sucrose or high NaCl was deleterious for cell survival, and no induction of γ was detected (not shown). Similarly, no γ was detected when osmolality of the medium was reduced (150 mosm) (Fig. 1B). Notably, the induced γ subunit appeared as a doublet on SDS-Tricine gels (Fig. 1B, top and middle) similar to the doublet usually seen with the kidney preparations. However, no γb stain was detected with the γb-specific antibodies (Fig. 1B, bottom). Therefore, the doublet comprised only γa, which apparently undergoes some posttranslational modification in NRK-52E cells. The data are reminiscent of what we have seen before with the γa stable transfectants, where post-translational modification of γa was observed in most of the clones (20Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Induction of γa in NRK-52E cells in response to osmotic stress was time-dependent. The level of γa expression relative to α1 was the highest after 48 h in both sucrose- and NaCl-supplemented media, and in both cases it declined somewhat after 5 days in hyperosmotic medium (Fig. 1C). When hyperosmolality in the culture medium was raised up to 500 mosm with urea, no induction of either γa or γb was detected (Fig. 1D), which is in agreement with the data on mIMCD-3 cells (22Capasso J.M. Rivard C. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 23: 3414-3419Google Scholar). Because urea is a membrane permeant whereas Na+ and sucrose represent impermeant osmolytes, the data suggest the involvement of specific hypertonicity-dependent signaling pathways in up-regulation of γa expression in cultured NRK-52E cells. Newly Synthesized γ Colocalizes with the Na,K-ATPase—To determine the subcellular location of the newly synthesized γa subunit, immunofluorescence analysis of NRK-52E cells grown under isotonic or hypertonic conditions was performed. Bright α1 stain (Fig. 2, left) was always localized at the plasma membrane, regardless of the osmolality in the medium. NRK-52E cells grown in isosmotic conditions had no detectable γ stain (Fig. 2, center). However, after 24 h of exposure to 500 mosm medium supplemented with sucrose (or with NaCl (not shown)), a uniform honeycomb staining (similar to the α1 stain) was detected with the γ-specific antibodies (Fig. 2, right) suggesting plasma membrane localization of the endogenously induced γa. Lack of staining with secondary anti-mouse Cy3conjugated antibodies alone of either hypertonicity-treated or untreated cells confirmed the specificity of immunofluorescence (not shown). Induction of γa in Response to Hypertonicity Is Not Tissue-specific—Kidney is the tissue that is exposed to large variations in hyperosmolality, but fluctuations occur mostly in the medullary region with the highest impact in the inner medullary zone, whereas the cortex environment is mostly isotonic. The fact that we observed induction of γa by hypertonicity in renal cells of proximal tubule origin apparently indicates a general cell response via a signaling process linked to the primary osmotic insult. In agreement, we observed similar induction of γa by hypertonicity (with NaCl) in different rat cell lines of other than renal origin: rat C6 glioma (Fig. 3A), rat pheochromocytoma PC12 (non-differentiated) (Fig. 3B), and rat L6 myoblasts (not shown). The data are especially interesting because expression of γ as a protein was shown to be almost limited to kidney (30Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), although reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed some other mouse tissues to express γ (31Jones D.H. Golding M.C. Barr K.J. Fong G.-H. Kidder G.M. Physiol. Genom. 2001; 6: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Induction of γ Is Not Limited to Hypertonicity—It is well established that hypertonicity elicits a genotoxic stress that is accompanied by cell growth arrest (delay) and concurrent DNA repair events (32Kultz D. Chakravarty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 33Kultz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To test whether expression of γa is a part of a general adaptive response, NRK-52E cells were subjected to other stresses known to have effects similar to hypertonicity, namely heat shock, oxidative stress, and chemical stress. As shown in Fig. 4A, incubation of NRK-52E either at 43 °C for 1 h or 24 h of treatment with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) or heavy metals (30 μm HgCl2) resulted in an induction of the γ subunit, although the level of γ expression was lower than in hypertonicity-treated cells. Similar to what was observed under hypertonic conditions, no γb was detected with specific antibodies (not shown). Accumulation of γa was apparently dose-dependent. More γ protein, for instance, was detected when cells were treated with 50 μm CdCl2versus 1 μm CdCl2 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, practically no difference in the level of induced γ was detected in crude membranes from NRK-52E that had been heated at 43 °C for 30 min as opposed to those cells exposed to 45 min of heat shock (Fig. 4C). Functional Consequences of γa Induction—To assess whether the newly synthesized γa was associated with the sodium pump and to determine the functional impact of γa expression, partial purification of the Na,K-ATPase from control or hypertonic cultures was performed using mild SDS treatment. The procedure results in extraction of most of the membrane-bound proteins while leaving the active sodium pump within the lipid bilayer (20Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After the SDS treatment, the membrane fragments containing Na,K-ATPase were isolated on sucrose density gradients and were tested on SDS-Tricine gels. The pilot experiments showed parallel co-distributions of α1 and γa along the gradient. The peak-containing fractions containing either α1β1 or α1β1γa complexes were collected and used for the subsequent kinetic assays to monitor the effect of γ on the stable properties of Na,K-ATPase, isolated from potential direct effects of hypertonicity. Dose-dependent accumulation of γa was obtained with NaCl as an osmolyte in culture medium (Fig. 5, A and B). As before, no stain was seen with the γb-specific antibodies, thus suggesting that the γ doublet apparently comprised the different structural variants of γa. No significant difference was noticed in the levels of the α1 subunit in the purified preparations. Further, we did not observe any significant difference in the phosphorylation level of α1 at the protein kinase C site (Ser-18) (34Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17726-17733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Staining with McK1 antibody, which recognizes only non-phosphorylated α1, was practically identical in preparations from control and hypertonicity-treated cultures (500 mosm, NaCl) (Fig. 5C, bottom panel). Similarly, no hypertonicity-induced changes were seen in the level of the β1 subunit, the only known isoform of the β subunit expressed in NRK-52E cells. 2E. Arystarkhova and K. J. Sweadner, unpublished observation. Different expression systems have been employed before to characterize the functional impact of γ on Na,K-ATPase activity. Based on the previous data from transfection studies (18Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K.

Thus, sodium dependence was tested here in SDS-purified preparations from control and high Na+-treated cultures (Fig. 5, B and D). Specific Na,K-ATPase activity was in the range of 50–150 μmol of Pi/mg/h. All experiments were performed in the presence of 20 mm K+ with and without 3 mm ouabain. To dissect a specific impact of γa on Na,K-ATPase activity all of the Na+ curves were normalized to the amount of α as detected in Western blots. Contrary to what we expecte"

Calmodulin is a ubiquitously expressed regulator of numerous cellular processes including cell cycle progression, cell mobility and contraction, ion homeostasis, and transcription. Most target proteins bind to the Ca2+-loaded form of calmodulin. Therefore, upon signals leading to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, calmodulin is able to bind to a new set of target proteins and modulate their activity (1Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Several transcriptional regulators are direct targets for calmodulin or are regulated by calmodulin-dependent kinases or the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (2Mellström B. Naranjo J.R.

Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). bHLH transcription factors can be divided into several classes based on their structure, dimerization properties, function, and expression pattern. E-proteins (class I bHLH transcription factors) are encoded by three mammalian genes, E2A, SEF2-1 (also denoted E2-2), and HEB. The E2A gene encodes the alternatively spliced protein products E12 and E47 (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). E-proteins usually function as heterodimers with members of a large family of tissue specific (class II) bHLH transcription factors. However, in B-cell development, where E-proteins are essential, the E-proteins are believed to function as dimers within the E-protein subfamily since no B-cell-specific class II bHLH transcription factor has been found (4Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). E-box DNA sequences, the recognition sequences for heterodimers of tissue-specific bHLH transcription factors and E-proteins, are also binding sites for E-protein homodimers (5Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Science. 1992; 256: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Potentially, binding of these homodimers to the E-boxes of tissue-specific promoters could thereby block binding of the appropriate tissue-specific bHLH factor/E-protein heterodimers. Therefore, mechanisms that regulate the binding of distinct bHLH dimers to these E-boxes are of significant interest. SEF2-1 and the E2A proteins E12 and E47 all bind calmodulin in vitro at physiologically relevant calmodulin concentrations (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The DNA binding basic sequence of these bHLH proteins also binds to calmodulin, and this interaction is modulated by sequences directly N-terminal to the basic domain (7Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the binding domains overlap, calmodulin bound E-proteins are inhibited from binding to DNA in vitro (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Significantly, increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration induced by the ionophore ionomycin is a potent inhibitor of the transcriptional activity of E47 and SEF2-1 on an E-box containing reporter plasmid (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, whether this correlation reflects an inhibition of the DNA binding of the E-proteins in vivo by calmodulin was not analyzed. Here we show that calmodulin overexpression inhibits the transcriptional activity of E12, E47, and SEF2-1. Using E12 mutants with amino acid substitutions in the calmodulin binding basic sequence, we also report a striking direct correlation between the levels of calmodulin inhibition of DNA binding in vitro and the effects of calmodulin overexpression and cellular Ca2+ mobilization on transcription. We also show nuclear co-localization of E12 and overexpressed calmodulin and a Ca2+-dependent interaction in cell extracts between calmodulin and E12 but not a calmodulin inhibition-deficient E12 mutant. Furthermore, DNA binding in vivo of E12, but not a calmodulin-resistant E12 mutant, is inhibited by overexpression of calmodulin. The data suggest that Ca2+ signaling inhibits the transcriptional activity of an E-protein by establishing an E-protein-calmodulin complex that prevents the E-protein from interaction with target DNA. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The cDNAs coding for murine E12 and E47 (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were inserted into pcDNAI/amp (Invitrogen) by excision with XhoI and BamHI and subsequent blunt end ligation to the EcoRV site of pcDNAI/amp. The MyoD cDNA was inserted as an EcoRI fragment from pMSV-MyoD (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI site of pcDNAI/amp. The cDNA coding for human SEF2-1 (E2-2) was isolated from a human λZAP library containing cDNA inserts from the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL-29 (8Sideras P. Nilsson L. Islam K.B. Quintana I.Z. Freihof L. Rosen A. Juliusson G. Hammarström L. Smith C.I. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 244-252PubMed Google Scholar). For expression vector construction, a SEF2-1 cDNA of the SEF2-1B type (9Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated from this cDNA library using a SEF2-1B probe (9Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it was subcloned as a blunt-ended EcoRI fragment into blunt-ended XhoI-BalI-digested pKGE346 (10Pilon M. Gullberg M. Lundgren E. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1047-1051PubMed Google Scholar), thereby replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-encoding fragment. The luciferase reporters for E12, 6×(μE5+μE2)-luciferase, and MyoD, 4×(MEF1)-luciferase and the hCMV-βgal plasmid for normalization of transfections have been described previously (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the mammalian calmodulin (CaM), pcDNAI/amp mCaM, has also been described previously (11Hughes K. Antonsson A. Grundström T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). E12 basic sequence mutants were generated by standard PCR mutagenesis and substituted into full-length E12 in pcDNAI/amp E12 as a DrdI-StuI fragment. For construction of C-terminal FLAG derivatives of E12 and the E12 mutant m8-4-7, BamHI, BglII, and XbaI sites were introduced at the stop codon of E12 and m8-4-7. Double-stranded oligonucleotides coding for two tandem copies of the FLAG epitope sequence were inserted between the BamHI and BglII sites. Cell Culture and Transfections—DG75 B-cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. DG75 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation as described (12Hughes K. Saarikettu J. Grundström T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 173: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). The IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell line was maintained in Hepes-buffered minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics. IMR-32 cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine (13Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). 106 cells were seeded per 5-cm plate 1 day before transfection. DNA-polyethyleneimine complexes were formed in 1 ml of serum-free minimum essential medium for 10 min and added on cells with the addition of 1 ml of serum-free minimum essential medium. Cells were exposed to DNA-polyethyleneimine complexes for 2 h, after which the medium was replaced with serum-containing minimum essential medium with or without 5 mm caffeine. Cells were harvested 20 h after the start of transfection and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described (12Hughes K. Saarikettu J. Grundström T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 173: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot with Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Cells were pelleted and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 pellet volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and kept on ice for 10 min. The cells were then vortexed for 10 s, the lysate was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at +4 °C, and the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was collected. The pellet was washed once with 1 ml of the hypotonic buffer, and nuclear proteins were extracted with one pellet volume of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture on ice for 30 min with occasional flicking of the tubes. The insoluble nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 3 min at +4 °C, and the supernatant with the nuclear extract was collected. Western blot analysis was performed using SuperSignal (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-E12 antibody (H-208, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of DNA Binding—E12 wild type and basic sequence-mutated E12 proteins containing the amino acid sequence from 483 to 652 were produced for DNA binding analyses as previously described (7Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). E12 wild type and most mutants were produced in Escherichia coli, whereas mutants m1–m7 were produced by in vitro translation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) of the E12 proteins were performed as previously described using an end-labeled DNA sequence containing the μE5 E-box as probe (7Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). DNA binding was quantified with a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining and confocal microscopy of transfected DG75 cells was performed essentially as described (14Hughes K. Edin S. Antonsson A. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36008-36013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with the exception that cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-E12 (H-208) and goat anti-calmodulin (N-19) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothio-cyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine red X-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). All antibodies were used as 1:50 dilutions. Higher laser power and detector sensitivity was used to detect endogenous proteins compared with overexpressed proteins in the confocal microscopy. Calmodulin-Sepharose Pull-down—DG75 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid for E12, the m8-4-7 mutant, or the empty vector. Whole cell lysates were prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) and diluted 5-fold in EMSA binding buffer with either 0.5 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. Diluted extracts were incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose (Stratagene) for 30 min, and the beads were washed three times with the Ca2+- or EDTA-containing buffer. Calmodulin-Sepharose-bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected with the anti-E12 (H-208) antibody or, in the case of the FLAG tagged proteins, with the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma). Chromatin Immunoprecipitations—107 DG75 cells were transiently transfected with the E-box luciferase reporter and with expression vector for either E47, E12, or the E12 mutant m8-4-7 and for calmodulin where indicated. 20 h after transfection, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched with a 120 volume of 2.5 m glycine, and cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice with 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was sonicated, clarified by centrifugation at +4 °C, and pre-cleared overnight with 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The pre-cleared extract was incubated 2 h further at +4 °C in presence of 2 μg/ml anti-E47 (N-649) antibody (Santa Cruz) for E47 immunoprecipitation and 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody M2 for FLAG immunoprecipitation. Immunocomplexes were bound for 1 h to 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads blocked in 0.3 mg/ml sonicated herring sperm DNA. Beads were washed 6 times with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer and three times with Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0. After every third wash, the beads were moved to clean tubes to prevent nonspecific binding of DNA to the tube walls. Cross-links were reversed with 1% SDS in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, at 65 °C overnight. DNA was phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and PCR-amplified for 28 cycles with the primer pair 5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′ that flanks the promoter sequence of the E-box luciferase reporter plasmid. Transcriptional Activity of E12, E47, and SEF2-1 Is Inhibited by Calmodulin Co-expression—Binding of calmodulin has been shown to inhibit DNA binding of E-proteins in vitro (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4366-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and a Ca2+ ionophore that increases the intracellular Ca2+ concentration has been shown to inhibit activation of transcription by E47 (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the way to determining if these phenomena are linked, we analyzed whether overexpression of calmodulin can also inhibit the transcriptional activity of E-proteins. The B-cell line DG75 was co-transfected with an E-box luciferase reporter and an expression vector for either E12, E47, SEF2-1, or the empty vector together with either the calmodulin expression vector or the corresponding empty expression vector. Calmodulin overexpression was found to inhibit E12, E47, and SEF2-1-induced E-box reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Co-transfection of 10 μg of calmodulin expression plasmid decreased transcriptional activation by E12 more than 15-fold, and E47- and SEF2-1-induced E-box reporter activity was also strongly inhibited by calmodulin overexpression. In contrast, transcriptional activation by MyoD, a bHLH protein whose DNA binding shows little calmodulin sensitivity in vitro (6Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23930-23937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Onions J. Hermann S. Grundström T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4366-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was not significantly affected by calmodulin overexpression (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell extracts revealed that calmodulin overexpression did not affect the level of expressed E12 protein or its nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 1B). Thus, calmodulin overexpression can selectively inhibit the transcriptional activity of an E-protein without affecting the nuclear level of the protein. E12 Mutants with Decreased Sensitivity to Calmodulin—To analyze if calmodulin binding to the basic sequence of the bHLH domain of E12 causes the inhibition of the transcriptional activation by cellular Ca2+ mobilization and calmodulin overexpression, we generated E12 mutants with amino acid substitutions in the basic sequence that bind both DNA and calmodulin. With the aim of generating E12 mutants with disrupted binding to calmodulin but not to DNA, we used the known structure of the E47-DNA complex (16Ellenberger T. Fass D. Arnaud M. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 970-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) to predict those amino acids likely not to be critical for the DNA binding by E12. These residues were preferentially mutated to alanine or, when necessary, to glutamine to produce the E12 mutants m1 to m8 (Fig. 2A). Three of the eight point mutants, m1, m2, and m3 (I562A, R560A and V559A, respectively), showed no detectable DNA binding in EMSA (Fig. 2B) and were subsequently excluded from further study. However, the remaining five point mutants all retained the DNA binding (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the effect of calmodulin on their DNA binding was analyzed in detail (Fig. 3). None of the five single amino acid substitutions led to a calmodulin-resistant E12 mutant protein. Compared with wild type E12, four of these mutants, m4, m5, m6, and m7, showed a slight decrease in sensitivity to calmodulin that was more evident at the higher calmodulin concentration (1 μm). Moreover, even though the fifth mutant, m8 (D561A), was less sensitive to calmodulin than the other four mutants, much of the sensitivity still remained (Fig. 3). In view of our recent NMR structural study, highlighting that the binding of the E12 basic sequence to calmodulin involves multiple alternative amino acid contacts, 2Larsson, G., Saarikettu, J., Sveshnikova, N., Zdunek, J., Schleucher, J., Grundström T., and Wijmenga, S. S., submitted for publication. we proposed that combinations of amino acid substitutions would lead to less calmodulin-sensitive mutants of E12. Thus, the amino acid substitution of the m8 mutant (D561A) was combined with m5 or m7 to produce the double mutants m8-5 and m8-7 or with those of both m4 and m7 to produce the triple mutant m8-4-7 (Fig. 2A). As expected, the DNA binding of the double mutants m8-5 and m8-7 was slightly less sensitive to calmodulin than that of the single mutant m8 (Fig. 3). The triple mutant m8-4-7 was the least calmodulin-sensitive mutant (Fig. 3). We also created mutants m10, m11, and m12 by combining glutamine substitutions in the amino acids substituted in the four single point mutants m4-m7 (Fig. 2A). Although these new mutants were all more resistant to calmodulin than wild type E12, they were not more resistant than the single mutant m8. Therefore, we generated mutant m13, which combined the D561A mutation of mutant m8 with glutamine substitutions at all four amino acid positions mutated in m4-m7. The m13 mutant and mutant m8-4-7 were the most resistant mutants in the series, being ∼20-fold less sensitive than wild type E12 to 1 μm calmodulin (Fig. 3). The set of mutants provides ideal molecular tools to probe the connection between Ca2+/calmodulin inhibition of E-protein DNA binding in vitro and activation of transcription in vivo. Decreased Inhibition of Transcriptional Activities of E12 Mutants by Ca2+/Calmodulin—We compared the effects of calmodulin overexpression on activation of transcription by the series of E12 mutants that represent a gradient of sensitivity to calmodulin inhibition of the DNA binding in vitro. DG75 cells were co-transfected with an expression vector for each E12 mutant in the presence of the calmodulin or empty expression vector. The relative effects of calmodulin overexpression on transcriptional activation by the various E12 mutants correlated to their ability to bind DNA in vitro in the presence of calmodulin (cf. Figs. 3 and 4A). Transcriptional activation by the single amino acid substitution mutants m4, m6, and m7, but not mutant m5, were slightly less inhibited by calmodulin overexpression than that of wild type E12. Moreover, among the single amino acid mutants tested, transcriptional activity by mutant m8 was the least inhibited by calmodulin overexpression (Fig. 4A). The transcriptional activity of the multiple amino acid substitution mutant m13 was inhibited by calmodulin overexpression to a similar extent as m8, whereas the activities of mutants m8-7 and m8-4-7 were nearly unaffected by calmodulin overexpression (Fig. 4A). We next analyzed the effect of increased intracellular Ca2+ on transcriptional activation in transfected DG75 B-cells by E12 and the most calmodulin-resistant mutant of E12, m8-4-7, by treatment with the Ca2+ pump blocker thapsigargin that leads to Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes. The activity of the E-box reporter without overexpression of E12 was inhibited by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 4B). This thapsigargin-sensitive activity is mainly due to E12/E47 since this is the predominant E-protein in DG75 (data not shown). Transcriptional activation by overexpressed E12 was as thapsigargin-sensitive as the endogenous E-protein activity (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the increase in transcriptional activation by overexpression of the mutant m8-4-7 was not affected by the Ca2+ inducer. We conclude that the transcriptional activity of E12 can be inhibited by Ca2+ stimulation in the presence of endogenous levels of calmodulin in DG75 cells, whereas transcriptional activation by a calmodulin-resistant mutant of E12 is not inhibited by Ca2+ stimulation in the B-cell line. Treatment of cells with caffeine has been shown to increase the intranuclear Ca2+ concentration in some cell types (17Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellström B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 18Hardingham G.E. Cruzalegui F.H. Chawla S. Bading H. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further study the effects of increased intracellular Ca2+ on transcriptional activity of E12 and E12 mutants, transfected IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells were stimulated with caffeine. The Ca2+ inducer caffeine decreased the transcriptional activity of wild type E12 to 40% of that of the activity in non-stimulated cells (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the effects of caffeine on the transcriptional activities were not significantly different from the wild type E12 for most mutants. However, the transcriptional activities of the multiple amino acid substitution mutants m8-7, m8-4-7, and m13 were all clearly less affected by caffeine than wild type E12. Thus, the three multiple amino acid substitution mutants whose DNA binding showed low calmodulin sensitivity in vitro all showed low caffeine and calmodulin overexpression sensitivity in vivo (cf. Figs. 3 and 4). Direct Correlation between Calmodulin Sensitivity of E12 Mutants in Vitro and in Vivo—The transcriptional activities of some of the E12 mutants were altered compared with the wild type E12 (data not shown). However, differences in the DNA binding abilities or transcriptional activities were not the cause of the differences between the E12 variants in the effects of calmodulin or caffeine, since there was no correlation between the transcriptional activities of wild type and mutants of E12 and the effects of calmodulin overexpression (r2 = 0.10, p = 0.28) or caffeine stimulation (r2 = 0.04, p = 0.52) on their transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the least calmodulin-sensitive mutant, m8-4-7, possessed a similar DNA binding ability and transcriptional activity in the absence of calmodulin overexpression or caffeine stimulation as the wild type E12 (data not shown). To analyze the correlation between the Ca2+/calmodulin sensitivities of E12 mutants in vitro and in vivo, the transcription levels of each E12 variant in the presence of overexpressed calmodulin and the Ca2+ inducer caffeine were expressed as a function of the DNA binding in vitro in the presence of 200 nm CaM (Fig. 5; regression lines are in gray and black, respectively). Linear regression analysis showed a striking direct correlation between calmodulin inhibition of DNA binding by E12 variants in vitro and the effects of calmodulin overexpression (r2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and caffeine stimulation (r2 = 0.96, p < 0.0001) on their transcriptional activities in vivo. Importantly, no individual mutant displayed any significant lack of correlation between Ca2+/calmodulin sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the activities of the mutants upon calmodulin overexpression correlated well with their activities upon caffeine stimulation (r2 = 0.97, p < 0.0001). Thus, Ca2+/calmodulin sensitivity of E12 in vitro and in vivo shows indistinguishable amino acid sequence specificity. Nuclear Co-localization of Overexpressed E12 and Calmodulin—Be"
https://openalex.org/W2032787990,"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) have been found within mammalian intracardiac ganglia, but the cellular effects of these neuropeptides remain poorly understood. Fluorometric calcium imaging and whole cell patch clamp recordings were used to examine the effects of PACAP and VIP on [Ca2+]i and neuroexcitability, respectively, in intracardiac neurons of neonatal rats. PACAP and VIP evoked rapid increases in [Ca2+]i that exhibited both transient and sustained components. Pharmacological experiments using PAC1 and VPAC receptor-selective antagonists demonstrated that the elevations in [Ca2+]i result from the activation of VPAC receptors. The transient increases in [Ca2+]i were shown to be the product of Ca2+ mobilization from caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores and were not due to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated calcium release. In contrast, the sustained [Ca2+]i elevations were dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and were blocked by the transient receptor channel antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, which suggests that they are due to Ca2+ entry via store-operated channels. In addition to elevating [Ca2+]i, both PACAP and VIP depolarized intracardiac neurons, and PACAP was further shown to augment action potential firing in these cells. Depolarization of intracardiac neurons by the neuropeptides was dependent on activation of VPAC receptors and the concomitant increases in [Ca2+]i. Although activation of PAC1 receptors alone had no direct effects on neuroexcitability, PAC1 receptor stimulation potentiated the VPAC receptor-induced depolarizations. Furthermore, enhanced action potential firing was only observed upon concurrent stimulation of PAC1 and VPAC receptors, which indicates that these receptors act synergistically to enhance neuroexcitability in intracardiac neurons.

These neuropeptides have pronounced effects on the central nervous system as well as on neurons and effector targets of the autonomic nervous system. For example, in the central nervous system, PACAP is involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and associative learning in mice (5Hashimoto H. Shintani N. Baba A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas VIP has been shown to regulate intrathalamic rhythm activity and may modulate information transfer through the thalamocortical circuit (6Lee S.H. Cox C.L. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, PACAP and VIP appear to play a major role in autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system. VIP has been shown to cause positive chronotropic and inotropic effects (7Rigel D.F. Grupp I.L. Balasubramaniam A. Grupp G. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: H1082-H1087PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karasawa Y.

Chiba S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, PACAP has been shown to cause a transient increase in sinus rate and atrial contractility that is followed by negative chronotropic and inotropic responses in isolated canine atria (10Hirose M. Furukawa Y. Nagashima Y. Lakhe M. Miyashita Y. Chiba S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 338: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Also, both PACAP and VIP are potent dilators of coronary arteries (11Huang M. Shirahase H. Rorstad O.P. Peptides. 1993; 14: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Kawasaki J. Kobayashi S. Miyagi Y. Nishimura J. Fujishima M. Kanaide H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Whereas these neuropeptides can directly influence cardiac tissues, the effects of PACAP and VIP on the heart are in part due to neuroregulatory effects on parasympathetic intracardiac ganglia (9Yonezawa T. Furukawa Y. Lakhe M. Nagashima Y. Hirose M. Chiba S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 315: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Hirose M. Furukawa Y. Nagashima Y. Lakhe M. Miyashita Y.

Mammalian intracardiac ganglia play a major role in neuronal control of the heart and are believed to be capable of independently monitoring and influencing cardiac function. A variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, including PACAP and VIP, appear to be involved in the relaying of information within intracardiac ganglia and onto effector targets such as cardiac valves, coronary arteries, and cardiomyocytes. PACAP and VIP have been detected by immunocytochemistry in nerve fibers in the heart, coronary vasculature, and cardiac parasympathetic ganglia (15Della N.G. Papka R.E. Furness J.B. Costa M. J.

Although extrinsic fibers may be one source of these neuropeptides in the heart (21Calupca M.A. Vizzard M.A. Parsons R.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 423: 26-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), PACAP and VIP are also found in cell bodies and nerve fibers of intrinsic cardiac neurons (15Della N.G. Papka R.E. Furness J.B.

Tissue Cell. 2000; 32: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that data clearly demonstrate that these endogenous neuropeptides are potent regulators of the cardiovascular system, the cellular mechanisms mediating their effects remain poorly understood. There are also conflicting reports in the literature concerning the mechanisms by which PACAP and VIP regulate the function of intrinsic cardiac neurons. For example, it has been suggested that PACAP and VIP modulate neurotransmission in rat cardiac ganglia by potentiating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (22Cuevas J. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Liu D-M. Cuevas J. Adams D.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas studies on guinea pig intracardiac neurons indicate that PACAP, but not VIP, regulates the excitability of intrinsic cardiac neurons, possibly by influencing the K+ conductance, IA (19Braas K.M. May V. Harakall S.A. Hardwick J.C. Parsons R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9766-9779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PACAP and VIP evoke their effects via the activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors (24Christophe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Shivers B.D. Gorcs T.J. Gottschall P.E. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). PAC1, or PACAP-selective receptors, bind both active forms of PACAP, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38, with equally high affinities but bind VIP with much lower affinity (26Gourlet P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Rathe J. De Neef P. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 287: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas nonselective VPAC (VPAC1 and VPAC2) receptors recognize PACAP-27, PACAP-38, and VIP with similar high affinities (27Gottschall P.E. Tatsuno I. Miyata A. Arimura A. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28Gottschall P.E. Tatsuno I. Arimura A.

At least seven isoforms of the PAC1 receptor exist due to alternative splicing of the mRNA, whereas no splice variants of VPAC1 or VPAC2 are presently known to exist. These different PAC1 isoforms and VPAC receptor types couple to distinct second messenger pathways (34Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L.

Rat intrinsic cardiac neurons express several isoforms of the PAC1 (PAC1-short, PAC1-HOP1, PAC1-HOP2) as well as both VPAC receptors (37DeHaven W.I. Cuevas J. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 328: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of the PAC1/VPAC receptor heterogeneity, which is also observed in other neuron types, such as mammalian cortical neurons, remain to be fully elucidated. The present study examined the ability of PACAP and VIP to regulate the electrical properties of intrinsic cardiac neurons from neonatal rats and to modulate [Ca2+]i in these cells. Both PACAP and VIP depolarize intracardiac neurons and increase [Ca2+]i by evoking Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores and promoting Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane. PACAP, but not VIP, also increased the number of action potentials fired by neurons in response to depolarizing current pulses. The changes in neuroexcitability evoked by PACAP and VIP were blocked by inhibiting the [Ca2+]i elevations produced by the neuropeptides. Membrane currents and [Ca2+]i were investigated in isolated intracardiac ganglion neurons of neonatal rats (4–7 days old). The preparation and culture of isolated intrinsic cardiac neurons have been previously described (38Fieber L.A. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 434: 215-237Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 36–72 h under a 95% air, 5% CO2 environment prior to the experiments. Microfluorometric Measurements—The calcium-sensitive dye fura2/AM was used for measuring intracellular free calcium concentrations in intracardiac neurons, as previously described (39Smith A.B. Adams D.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 264: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells plated on coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in physiological saline solution (PSS) consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 7.7 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH to 7.2 with NaOH), which also contained 1 μm fura-2/AM and 0.1% Me2SO. The coverslips were then washed in PSS (fura-2/AM-free) prior to the experiments being carried out. All solutions were applied via a rapid application system identical to that previously described (40Cuevas J. Berg D.K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10335-10344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A DG-4 high speed wavelength switcher (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) was used to apply alternating excitation with 340- and 380-nm UV light. Fluorescent emission at 510 nm was captured using a Sensicam digital CCD camera (Cooke Corp., Auburn Hills, MI) and recorded with Slidebook Version 3.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) on a Pentium IV computer. Changes in [Ca2+]i were calculated using the Slidebook 3 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) from the intensity of the emitted fluorescence following excitation with 340- and 380-nm light, respectively, using the equation, [Ca2+]i=KdQ(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)(Eq. 1) where R represents the fluorescence intensity ratio (F340/F380) as determined during experiments, Q is the ratio of Fmin to Fmax at 380 nm, and Kd is the Ca2+ dissociation constant for fura-2. Calibration of the system was performed using a fura-2 calcium imaging calibration kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and values were determined to be as follows: Fmin/Fmax = 23.04; Rmin = 0.31; Rmax = 8.87. Electrophysiology—Coverslips containing the dissociated neurons were transferred to a 0.5-ml recording chamber mounted on a phase-contrast microscope (400×). The extracellular recording solution was identical to the Ca2+ imaging PSS. The Ca2+-free PSS contained no CaCl2 and included 1 mm EGTA. All drugs were bath-applied in PSS. In some electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging experiments, the order of drug administration was reversed, whereby PACAP was given in the presence of other drugs (or in Ca2+-free PSS) prior to being given alone. This alteration in the protocol was done as a control to ensure that any change in response was not due to rundown. Currents were amplified and filtered (5 kHz) using an Axoclamp-200B amplifier, digitized with a 1322A DigiData digitizer (20 kHz), and collected on a Pentium IV computer using the Clampex 8 program (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Data analysis was conducted using the pClamp 8 program, Clampfit. The whole cell perforated patch variation of the patch clamp recording technique was used as previously described (41Rae J. Cooper K. Gates P. Watsky M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 42Xu Z.J. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 456: 425-441Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This configuration preserves intracellular integrity, preventing the loss of cytoplasmic components and subsequent alteration of functional responses of these neurons (22Cuevas J. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 43Cuevas J. Harper A.A. Trequattrini C. Adams D.J. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1890-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 75 mm K2SO4, 55 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, 198 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 0.4% Me2SO. Membrane potential responses to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current pulses (–100 to +200 pA) were determined in the absence and presence of VIP/PACAP receptor ligands. The mean resting membrane potential, latency for action potential firing, action potential duration, amplitude of afterhyperpolarization, and the number of action potentials elicited by depolarizing current pulses were determined in the absence and presence of PAC1 and VPAC receptor ligands. Membrane input resistance was also determined as described previously (42Xu Z.J. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 456: 425-441Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Reagents and Statistical Analysis—All chemicals used in this investigation were of analytic grade. The following drugs were used: amphotericin B, Me2SO, mecamylamine, caffeine, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (Sigma); PACAP-27, PACAP-38, l-8-K (VIP receptor binding inhibitor), [N-Ac-Tyr1,d-Phe2]GRF-(1–29), and VIP (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA); tetrodotoxin (TTX), ryanodine, thapsigargin, and forskolin (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel); barium chloride (Fisher); and fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Recombinant maxadilan and M65 were generous gifts from E. A. Lerner (Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School). All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the number of observations indicated. Statistical analysis was conducted using SigmaPlot 8 (SPSS, Chicago, IL), and paired and unpaired t-tests were used for within group and between group comparisons, respectively. PACAP and VIP Directly Increase Free [Ca2+]i—The most abundant PAC1 receptor isoform expressed in neonatal rat intrinsic cardiac neurons, PAC1-HOP, has been shown to elicit elevations in intracellular calcium in cortical neurons (44Grimaldi M. Cavallaro S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 921: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between PACAP and intracellular calcium has not been investigated in the autonomic neurons. The effect of PACAP on Ca2+ handling in intracardiac neurons was studied using fura-2 Ca2+-imaging techniques. Fig. 1A shows a representative trace of change in [Ca2+]i (Δ[Ca2+]i) as a function of time recorded from a neuron before, during and following a 2-min application of 100 nm PACAP-27. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increased by >400 nm when PACAP-27 was applied and returned to near control levels upon washout of drug. In similar experiments, PACAP-27 significantly increased intracellular calcium by ∼400%, from a baseline of 65.3 ± 5.5 nm to a peak value of 335.1 ± 65.4 nm (n = 23) (Fig. 1B). In all cells responding to PACAP, the elevations in [Ca2+]i were reversed when PACAP was removed from the bath, and subsequent applications of PACAP to the same cell produced [Ca2+]i increases of similar magnitude. In a series of experiments, the PAC1 receptor-selective agonist, maxadilan, and VPAC receptor-selective agonist, VIP, were used to determine the PACAP/VIP receptor subtype(s) mediating the PACAP-induced elevations in [Ca2+]i.Fig. 1A shows representative traces of change in [Ca2+]i recorded from two neurons as a function of time before, during and following a 2-min application of maxadilan and VIP, respectively. Maxadilan, at a concentration (10 nm) specific for PAC1 (45Moro O. Lerner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), failed to elicit a change in [Ca2+]i. In contrast, VIP, at a concentration (100 nm) that preferentially activates VPAC receptors (26Gourlet P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Rathe J. De Neef P. Robberecht P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 287: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), reversibly increased [Ca2+]i by >225 nm in this neuron. In 14 similar experiments, 100 nm VIP significantly increased mean peak [Ca2+]i by more than 225%, from 73.2 ± 12.1 nm to 239.1 ± 27.4 nm, which is an increase comparable with that observed when PACAP-27 was used as the agonist (Fig. 1B). Maxadilan (10–100 nm), however, did not elicit any detectable changes in [Ca2+]i in any of the cells tested (Fig. 1B; n = 7), which suggests that the PAC1 receptor is not responsible for the PACAP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i observed in these cells. Increases in Free [Ca2+]i Evoked by PACAP and VIP Are Mediated by a VPAC Receptor—To confirm that activation of VPAC receptors is responsible for the PACAP-induced elevations in [Ca2+]i, the PAC1 receptor-specific antagonist M65, and VPAC receptor-specific antagonists l-8-K and [N-Ac-Tyr1, d-Phe2]GRF-(1–29), were used. Fig. 2 shows representative traces of change in [Ca2+]i as a function of time during application of 100 nm PACAP-27 alone (Fig 2, A–C) or when the neuropeptide was co-applied with 100 nm M65 (Fig. 2A), 5 μml-8-K (Fig. 2B, dashed trace), or 100 nm [N-Ac-Tyr1,d-Phe2]GRF-(1–29) (YF-GRF) (Fig. 2C). Only the VPAC receptor antagonists were shown to block the effects of PACAP on [Ca2+]i. A bar graph of results obtained in similar experiments is shown in Fig. 2D and reveals that application of either l-8-K (n = 9) or YF-GRF (n = 5) significantly attenuated PACAP-evoked elevations in [Ca2+]i in isolated intracardiac neurons, whereas M65 (n = 5) had no effects on the neuropeptide-induced changes in [Ca2+]i. These data further support the conclusion that the PACAP and VIP evoked increases in [Ca2+]i are mediated by VPAC receptors and not PAC1 receptors in these cells. PACAP and VIP are known to modulate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in intrinsic cardiac neurons (23Liu D-M. Cuevas J. Adams D.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the observed PACAP- and VIP-induced elevations in [Ca2+]i may be due to regulation of presynaptic or postsynaptic nAChRs by the neuropeptides. Thus, the Na+ channel blocker, TTX (400 nm), and ganglionic nAChR blocker, mecamylamine (25 μm), were used to block nicotinic neurotransmission pre- and postsynaptically, respectively, to verify that the effects of exogenously applied PACAP and VIP on [Ca2+]i are not indirectly caused by nAChR modulation. Neither the application of TTX (n = 4) nor mecamylamine (n = 3) prevented the PACAP-induced rise in [Ca2+]i in rat intracardiac neurons. The application of PACAP-27 (100 nm) in the presence of TTX significantly (p < 0.01) elevated [Ca2+]i from 107.1 ± 13.8 to 286.8 ± 25.1 nm, values comparable with the calcium elevations seen in the absence of TTX. Similarly, PACAP-27 increase in [Ca2+]i was unaffected by the application of mecamylamine (65.4 ± 9.5 to 236.6 ± 31.2 nm), a 265% increase in intracellular calcium (data not shown). These results suggest that the observed PACAP-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is not dependent on neurotransmission. PACAP and VIP Mobilize Ca2+from Intracellular Stores and Evoke Ca2+Entry through the Plasma Membrane—PAC1 and VPAC receptors have been linked to both Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane via the activation of L-type calcium channels (36Chatterjee T.K. Sharma R.V. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32226-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 46Tanaka K. Shibuya I. Uezono Y. Ueta Y. Toyohira Y. Yanagihara N. Izumi F. Kanno T. Yamashita H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (47MacKenzie C.J. Lutz E.M. Johnson M.S. Robertson D.N. Holland P.J. Mitchell R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted to determine the source of Ca2+ responsible for the VPAC-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. Application of PACAP-27 produced an increase in [Ca2+]i that exhibited both a transient and a sustained component (Fig. 3A). However, when PACAP was applied in Ca2+-free PSS, the initial transient increase in [Ca2+]i was observed, but the sustained component was abolished (Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed when VIP was used as the agonist (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows a bar graph of mean peak and sustained [Ca2+]i recorded under normal and Ca2+-free conditions from 12 isolated intracardiac neurons. Although the magnitude of the transient peak [Ca2+]i remained unchanged (normal PSS: 179.2 ± 17.6 nm; Ca2+-free PSS: 173.4 ± 17.8 nm), the sustained component significantly decreased from 103.6 ± 11.5 to 45.7 ± 6.7 nm following the removal of extracellular Ca2+. This latter [Ca2+]i value was equivalent to control baseline [Ca2+]i. Thus, the sustained component is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and is probably due to Ca2+ flux through the plasmalemma. The presence of a PACAP-induced transient elevation in [Ca2+]i in the absence of extracellular calcium suggested that activation of VPAC receptors mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores in these neurons. In order to test this hypothesis, we used the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, which specifically blocks Ca2+ reuptake, leading to depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (48Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to the experiments, dissociated intracardiac neurons were incubated for 1 h in 20 μm thapsigargin (in PSS, 37 °C). Experiments were then conducted to determine whether PACAP increased [Ca2+]i under these conditions. Untreated neurons collected from either the same neonatal rat or animals from the same litter were used as positive controls. Fig. 3C shows traces of change in [Ca2+]i recorded from two neurons preincubated in 20 μm thapsigargin and exposed to either 100 nm PACAP-27 or 500 μm acetylcholine (ACh). PACAP failed to elicit a change in [Ca2+]i in these neurons, but ACh, which promotes Ca2+ entry via plasma membrane nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in intracardiac neurons (49Beker F. Weber M. Fink R.H. Adams D.J. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 1956-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), produced a pronounced transient elevation in [Ca2+]i. In similar experiments, thapsigargin pretreatment significantly decreased the peak PACAP response from 370.3 ± 40.9 to 105.0 ± 8.3 nm (n = 6; Fig. 3D), with the latter value being indistinguishable from the baseline [Ca2+]i me"
https://openalex.org/W2051303994,"Direct interaction of positive and negative regulators with the general transcription machinery modulates transcription. The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is one target for transcriptional regulators. In this study, we identified ZNF76 as a novel transcriptional repressor that targets TBP. ZNF76 interacts with TBP through both its N and C termini, and both regions are required for ZNF76 to exert its inhibitory function on p53-mediated transactivation. The inhibitory effect of ZNF76 on p53 activity was demonstrated by reporter assays and endogenous target gene expression. We mapped the TBP-interacting region in the C terminus of ZNF76 to a glutamic acid-rich domain, which acts in a dominant negative manner to enhance p53-mediated transactivation in reporter assays. Mutagenesis study for ZNF76 suggests a correlation between interaction with TBP and effect on p53-mediated transactivation, supporting the conclusion that ZNF76 targets TBP for transcriptional repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that ZNF76 prevents TBP from occupying the endogenous p21 promoter. ZNF76 is sumoylated by PIAS1 at lysine 411, which is in the minimal TBP-interacting region. Overexpression of PIAS1 and SUMO-1 abolishes the interaction between ZNF76 and TBP and partially relieves the repressive effect of ZNF76. These results suggest that ZNF76 functions as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with TBP and that sumoylation modulates its transcriptional repression activity.

These results suggest that ZNF76 functions as a transcriptional repressor through its interaction with TBP and that sumoylation modulates its transcriptional repression activity. Gene transcription is regulated by positive and negative acting factors. Negative regulation of transcription is an essential mechanism for precise control of gene expression. So fundamental are such transcriptional repressors that they are necessary for the viability of yeast (1Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2Kim S. Na J.G. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms repressors employ is contacting components of the basal transcription machinery. The TATA-binding protein (TBP), 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GARD, glutamic acid-rich domain. an important component of the basal transcription machinery utilized by all three RNA polymerases, is a frequent target for transcriptional regulators. Several general transcriptional repressors that target TBP have been identified, such as E1A (3Song C.Z. Loewenstein P.M. Toth K. Tang Q. Nishikawa A. Green M. Mol. Cell.

Stelzer G. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Most general transcriptional repressors were initially identified in yeast. Despite the wealth of data demonstrating interactions of TBP and transcriptional repressors in vitro, there is less experimental data defining how they work in mammalian cells and how their transcriptional repression functions are modulated. Sumoylation is one of the important posttranslational modifications that affect protein functions. In mammalian cells, the SUMO protein family consists of three members, SUMO-1, -2, and -3. Sumoylation is biochemically similar to ubiquitination (9Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). SUMO-1 conjugation utilizes a unique E1-activating enzyme complex termed SAE1/SAE2 (Aos1/Uba2), an E2-conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, and a group of E3 ligases that were characterized recently, including the PIAS family members (10Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 11Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

Instead of being marked for degradation by ubiquitination, sumoylation has diverse substrate-specific functions. Because both sumoylation and ubiquitination occur at lysine residues, sumoylation has been shown to inhibit protein ubiquitination and enhance the protein stability, as exemplified by sumoylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (14Comerford K.M.

Sumoylation also affects protein localization. A transcriptional repressor, CtBP, can be recruited to PcG complexes after being sumoylated (13Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). ZNF76 is a human homolog of Staf (selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription-activating factor) (22Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which is a Xenopus zinc-finger transcription factor known to regulate genes encoding selenocysteine tRNA (tRNAsec) and small nuclear RNA, such as U1 and U6. Staf shows 84 and 64% amino acid sequence identity with human ZNF143 and ZNF76, respectively. Recently, ZNF76 was also shown to activate transcription of a molecular chaperonin subunit Ccta gene (23Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting multiple roles of ZNF76 for transcriptional regulation. The ZNF76 gene is located at chromosome 6p21 in a region associated with a range of phenotypic abnormalities that affect embryonic development, male fertility, and neoplasia (24Tripodis N. Mason R.

Through TBP interaction, ZNF76 inhibits p53-mediated gene expression. We also showed that sumoylation by PIAS1 regulates the transcriptional repression function of ZNF76. Reagents and Antibodies—Anti-Myc (9E10), anti-TBP (sc-273), and anti-p21 (H-164) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG (M2) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-HA antibody was from BAbCo (Richmond, CA). Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from TREVIGEN, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Anti-ZNF76, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against purified GST-ZNF76, was prepared by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Plasmid Construction—pGBKT7-PIAS1 and subfragments of PIAS1 in pGBKT7 vector were constructed by insertion of murine PIAS1 cDNA encoding the full length or the corresponding PIAS1 fragments into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGBKT7 vector (MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid system 3, Clontech, Inc). pcDNA-ZNF76-Myc and other Myc-tagged ZNF76 mutants were constructed by insertion of the corresponding cDNA fragments into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1-Myc-HisB (Invitrogen). GAL4 AD fusion construct pGADT7-ZNF76 and other ZNF76 mutants were constructed by insertion of the corresponding cDNA fragments into EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGADT7 vector. pGEX4T-1-ZNF76 was constructed using EcoRI and BamH1 sites of pGEX4T-1. All of the site-directed mutant constructs were generated by a two-step PCR method and were confirmed by sequencing. pCMV5-PIAS1, which encodes FLAG-tagged full-length PIAS1 was a gift from Dr. Ke Shuai (26Liu B.

The pMT2-F-TBP vector was a gift from Dr. Cheng-Ming Chiang (27Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged SUMO-1 was a gift from Dr. Hideyo Yasuda (11Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Xiao H. Chung J. Kao H.Y. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11197-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and U2OS cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Transient Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation method with various plasmid combinations as indicated. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with occasional vortexing. To test Zn2+-dependent protein-protein interaction, ZnCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1.3 μm in the lysis buffer. The lysates were collected into 1.5-ml tubes and cleared of nuclei by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants (whole cell extracts) were incubated with different antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C, and protein A-agarose beads were added for the last hour. The beads were washed five times in TNEN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 or 0.5% Brij35 if testing endogenous protein-protein interaction, 10 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF; plus 1.3 μm Zn2+ if testing zinc-dependent protein-protein interaction). Bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with the ECL detection system used for protein detection. For sumoylation assays, 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed either in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide or in a denaturing buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Luciferase Assay—The cells were plated and grown overnight before transfection. The total amount of DNA transfected was adjusted with pcDNA3. Luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid was co-transfected with the plasmids as indicated. The relative luciferase units were corrected based on Renilla luciferase activity. In the assay for p53-mediated gene expression, a reporter containing a synthetic p53-binding site upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (pG13-luc) was used. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech, Inc) was used in the yeast two-hybrid screen. The bait used was PIAS1(1–390) containing the N terminus and the zinc finger domain. After screening 1 × 106 clones, clones that interacted with the bait but not lamin were considered positive. Positive clones were sequenced and analyzed by the BLAST program. In mapping the interacting domains, the interactions were scored by the expression of β-galactosidase in the yeast two-hybrid mating assay. Yeast extracts were prepared by urea/SDS method according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech; Protocol PT3024–1). Yeast extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Protein expression was detected by Western blot with indicated antibodies. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Two days after transfection with indicated plasmids, HEK293 cells (one 150-mm plate) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in cell culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C, and cross-linking was quenched with 1.25 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cells were harvested and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Nuclei were collected and resuspended in 500 μl of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin). The chromatin samples were sonicated to yield DNA fragments between 300 and 2000 bp with an average length of about 500 bp. For each immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of sheared chromatin was diluted to 1 ml with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl). Prior to chromatin immunoprecipitation, the chromatin solution was precleared with 80 μlof protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) containing 240 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA and 240 μg/ml of tRNA at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. The precleared chromatin was collected and incubated at 4 °C overnight with 5 μg of anti-FLAG, 5 μg of anti-HA, 10 μl of anti-p53, 10 μl of anti-TBP, or 10 μl of anti-Myc antibody as indicated. Anti-Myc was used as a negative control. The immune complexes were precipitated with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant in the absence of antibody was used as the total chromatin input for later PCR analysis. The beads were then washed in the following order: 1 ml of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer, TSE-500 wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl/detergent wash buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid), and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), twice in each buffer with a 10-min period between washes. The antibody-protein-DNA immunocomplexes were eluted twice with 250 μlof elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3). The sample was vortexed briefly and incubated at room temperature for 15 min with rotation. Formaldehyde cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C overnight with the addition of 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm. All of the samples were digested at 45 °C for 1 h with 10 μg of RNase A and 20 μg of proteinase K. The DNA fragments were extracted by phenol-chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed by PCR. The DNA agarose gels were visualized with the VersaDoc imaging system from Bio-Rad. The primer pair for the p21 promoter produced a 111-bp product. The primer sequences are 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCCTGTCGCAAGGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGAAGGGGATGGTAG-3′. ZNF76 Is a PIAS1-interacting Protein—We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel PIAS1-interacting proteins. The bait used in the screening was PIAS1(1–390) containing the N terminus and the zinc finger domain. The first reason to use this fragment as the bait was that full-length PIAS1 has high background and is not suitable as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen. Secondly, the region we chose contains zinc finger domains and four LXXLL motifs, which are important domains for mediating protein-protein interactions. After screening 106 clones, eight positive clones were identified and sequenced. Two of them are the cDNA sequences for Homo sapiens thioredoxin domain containing 7 (NM_005742); two for H. sapiens translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 50 homolog (yeast) (TIMM50) (XM_053074); one for Homo sapiens DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog (NM_001539); one for H. sapiens ankyrin repeat family A protein 2 (AF314032); and one for H. sapiens heat shock 70-kDa protein 5 (NM_005347) (protein disulfide isomerase). Among them there is a clone whose sequence is identical to that of human ZNF76. ZNF76 Acts as a Transcriptional Repressor—Because PIAS1 is an E3 sumoylation ligase for p53 (11Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and an activator for p53 (29Megidish T. Xu J.H. Xu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we tested whether ZNF76 modulates p53 transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 1a, we titrated the amount of ZNF76-expressing plasmid in a luciferase assay. A reporter plasmid pG13-luc that has a p53-binding site was transfected into HEK293 cells along with plasmids expressing HA-p53 and Myc-ZNF76. p53-mediated reporter gene expression was induced ∼10-fold by transfecting 10 ng of HA-p53 expressing plasmid. Co-transfection of pcDNA-ZNF76 inhibited p53-induced luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner. There is a significant inhibitory effect when only 5 ng of ZNF76 expression plasmid was transfected, and protein expression could not be detected by Western blotting. This argues against the notion that the inhibition is an artifact because of gross overexpression of ZNF76. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1b, overexpression of ZNF76(1–375) or ZNF76(342–570) could not repress the transcriptional activity of p53, suggesting that the structural integrity of ZNF76 is essential for inhibiting the transcriptional activity of p53. Interestingly, transfection of ZNF76(342–570) increased basal and p53-induced activity in the reporter assays. The strong inhibitory effect of ZNF76 on p53 was also observed in various cell lines including HeLa, U2OS (Fig. 1c), MCF-7, and H1299 (data not shown). To test whether ZNF76 also inhibits p53-dependent expression of endogenous genes, we examined whether ZNF76 could inhibit p53-mediated expression of the p21 protein. As shown in Fig. 1d, ectopic expression of ZNF76 abolished p21 expression induced by p53 but had no effect on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. These results suggest that ZNF76 is a transcriptional repressor that inhibits p53-mediated gene expression. To address whether the repressive effect of ZNF76 is selective for p53, we tested the effect of ZNF76 on two other transcription activators, Stat1 and Smad3. As shown in Fig. 1e, human MCF-7 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter construct, IRF1-luc, containing three copies of the Stat1-binding sequence and expression vectors encoding ZNF76-Myc and treated with or without interferon-γ. The Stat1-activated luciferase expression in response to interferon-γ stimulation was significantly inhibited by ZNF76 in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, ZNF76 also strongly inhibited Smad3-mediated transactivation (Fig. 1f). These results suggest that ZNF76 is a general transcriptional repressor. ZNF76 Interacts with TBP—One of the frequent targets for transcriptional repressors is the TBP, and several viral proteins repress p53 transactivation by interacting with TBP (30Massimi P. Banks L. Virology. 1997; 227: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Qadri I. Iwahashi M. Simon F. Biochim. Biophys.

Virol. 2002; 76: 12503-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To test whether ZNF76 and TBP complex in cells, pCMV2-FLAG-TBP and pcDNA-ZNF76-Myc were transfected alone or co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Lysates of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoblots probed with anti-Myc showed that anti-FLAG pulled down Myc-tagged ZNF76 only when pCMV2-FLAG-TBP but not the empty vector was present (Fig. 2a), suggesting TBP complexes with ZNF76 in cells. The endogenous interaction of ZNF76 and TBP was further demonstrated in MCF-7 cells by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations using anti-ZNF76 and anti-TBP antibodies (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2ZNF76 interacts with TBP.a, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) of ZNF76 and TBP in HEK293 cells. 1 μg of plasmids pFLAG-CMV2-TBP and pCDNA-ZNF76-Myc was co-transfected or transfected alone into HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (2 μl) or anti-Myc (10 μl) and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc. b, endogenous association of ZNF76 with TBP in MCF-7 cells. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were immunoprecipitated with anti-ZNF76, normal rabbit IgG, or anti-TBP antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates wereimmunoblotted with anti-TBP and anti-ZNF76. c, interaction of ZNF76 mutants with TBP in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. d, both the N and C termini of ZNF76 interact with TBP in yeast. After yeast mating, both yeast growth on SD-HTL, and positive β-galactosidase activity were used as criteria of positive interaction. Shown on the right is the schematic representation of ZNF76 mutants that were expressed in the bait vector as fusions with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain.

In contrast to full-length ZNF76, mutant ZNF76(1–375) interacted weakly with TBP. ZNF76(342–570) but not the zinc finger domain ZNF76(150–375) also associated with TBP (Fig. 2c). To confirm these results, we employed the yeast two-hybrid assay to map the interacting regions. Both yeast growth on SD-HTL medium and positive β-galactosidase activity were used as criteria for positive interactions. As shown in Fig. 2d, in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation results, both the N terminus and the C terminus, but not the zinc finger domain of ZNF76, interacted with TBP. Yeast expression of ZNF76 mutant fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 2e. Because the C terminus of ZNF76 interacts with TBP and can enhance p53-mediated transactivation in the reporter assay (Fig. 1b), we further mapped the interacting regions in the C terminus of ZNF76. After examining the sequence, we found a glutamic acid-rich domain (GARD) 83 amino acids in length (amino acids 362–444) in the C terminus of ZNF76 (labeled as a bar in Fig. 2i and thereafter). We tested whether GARD itself is sufficient for interaction with TBP in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 2f, both yeast growth on SD-HTL and β-galactosidase assays support the interaction between GARD and TBP. Fusion protein expression in yeast is shown in Fig. 2g. Consistently, we found that ZNF76(342–570)K400,411R, a C terminus mutant of ZNF76 with two lysine residues in GARD changed to arginine, lost its interaction with TBP (Fig. 2h), suggesting that GARD is essential for the C terminus of ZNF76 to interact with TBP. Fig. 2i is a summary of the mapping results. These data demonstrate that ZNF76 interacts with TBP through both its N terminus and GARD in its C terminus. The 180-amino acid C-terminal domain of TBP is commonly referred to as the TBP core domain, which is responsible for recognizing the TATA box. The core domain of TBP is highly conserved, whereas the N-terminal region of TBP is more divergent (Fig. 3a). We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to map the regions of TBP responsible for interacting with ZNF76. As shown in Fig. 3b, plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant TBP were co-transfected into HEK293 cells together with pcDNA-ZNF76-Myc. We found that FLAG-tagged TBP(146–339), which includes the core domain of TBP but not FLAG-tagged TBP(1–159), co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged ZNF76. These results suggest that, like other transcriptional repressors that target TBP such as NC2 (37Kamada K. Shu F. Chen H. Malik S. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Burley S.K.

ZNF76 Targets TBP to Inhibit p53 Activity—Because ZNF76 interacts with TBP, we tested whether ZNF76 inhibits p53-mediated gene expression through interaction with TBP. As shown in Fig. 4a, ectopic expression of TBP reversed the inhibitory effect of ZNF76 on p53-mediated transactivation. Although ectopic expression of TBP modestly in"

Indirect studies have led to the prediction that NKCC1 operates as a dimer assembled through binding domains that are distal to the amino portion of the carrier. In this study, evidence is presented that NKCC1 possesses self-interacting properties that result in the formation of a large complex between the proximal and the distal segment of the cytosolic C terminus. Elaborate mapping studies of these segments showed that the contact sites are dispersed along the entire C terminus, and they also led to the identification of a critical interacting residue that belongs to a putative forkhead-associated binding domain. In conjunction with previous findings, our results indicate that the uncovered interacting domains are probably a major determinant of the NKCC1 conformational landscape and assembly into a high order structure. A model is proposed in which the carrier could alternate between monomeric and homo-oligomeric units via chemical- or ligand-dependent changes in conformational dynamics.

The CCC family also includes carrier-like molecules for which no ionic substrates have been identified to date; they are called orphan CCCs (12Caron L. Rousseau F. Gagnon E. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The main function of a CCC is to regulate the ion or volume content of individual cells and to facilitate salt movement across various epithelia (1Haas M. Forbush B. Annu. Rev.

The best example studied thus far is the phosphorylation-dependent activation of NKCC1, a ubiquitous CCC that is expressed basolaterally in polarized cells (1Haas M. Forbush B. Annu. Rev.

Based on computer-aided analyses from which this model is derived, the CCCs are predicted to have a membrane-associated domain flanked by cytosolic termini. For NKCC1, the membrane localization of the central domain has been confirmed indirectly by the identification of regions that mediate ion transport (24Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen.

Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For this carrier system, likewise, the intracellular localization of both termini has been confirmed indirectly by the identification of epitope sites that are not accessible unless the lipid bilayer is permeabilized (28Isenring P. Forbush B. Int. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; (abstr.)Google Scholar) and by the identification of phosphoacceptor sites that are involved in transporter regulation (3Payne J.A. Forbush B. Curr. Opin.

For example, cross-linking of NKCC1, NKCC2, or NCC in membrane extracts leads to the formation of large complexes, the molecular size of which is twice that of the monomeric forms (29Cheng S. Xu J.Z. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10 (Abstr. A0176): 34AGoogle Scholar, 30Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In agreement with these studies, we and others have observed that non-functional NKCC1 mutants or NKCC2 splice variants can reduce the activity of functional versions of these carriers in heterologous expression systems, implying that they exert a dominant negative effect through direct homo-oligomerization of the carriers or through their association with an accessory protein (31Gagnon E. Forbush B. Caron L. Isenring P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C365-C370Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). High resolution imaging data confirming the interpretation of such findings are unavailable at present. In this study, we have exploited the yeast two-hybrid system to search for additional partners of NKCC1 using the proximal C terminus as bait, and we have found a sequence that belongs to the distal C terminus of the same protein. We have also found that the association between the two regions involves a large number of residues and that it could also be phosphorylation-dependent. Hence, our results identify for the first time a self-interacting domain in NKCC1 and points toward novel mechanisms by which CCCs regulate their activity. Chemicals, Reagents, Kits, and Cell Strains—Unless mentioned otherwise, chemicals, reagents, or kits were from several suppliers. They included the following antibodies (Abs): 1) a mouse anti-hemaglutinin (HA) Ab (Biochem, catalog number MM5-101R; 2) a goat anti-LexA Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number SC-1726); 3) a mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number NXA931; and 4) a goat horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgG (Roche Applied Science, catalog number 1301977). Vectors and cDNA constructs were propagated in XL1-blue cells (Stratagene). Some of these sequences were also introduced in EGY48 yeast (Clontech) and BL21 Escherichia coli cells (Amersham Biosciences) as described below. Vectors—Subcloning, expression of reporter genes, or DNA amplification was carried out with the following (empty or insert-bearing) vectors: 1) pGilda (Clontech), which contains 5′ to 3′, the ADH1 (anti-diuretic hormone 1) promoter, a sequence encoding the LexA DNA-binding domain, a multiple cloning site (MCS), a His transformation marker (His™), and an ampicillin resistance gene (AMPR); 2) pB42AD (Clontech), which contains the PGAL1 promoter, a sequence encoding the activating domain of a transcription factor and the HA epitope, an MCS, a Trp™, and an AMPR; 3) p8op-LacZ (Clontech), which contains LexA operators (ops) that can interact with the pB42AD-derived activating domain, two reporter genes (Leu and LacZ) that are under the control of LexA, a Ura™ and an AMPR; 4) pGEX (Amersham Biosciences), which contains the Ptac promoter, a sequence encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), an MCS, and an AMPR; 5) pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which contains the T7 promoter, an MCS, and an AMPR; and 6) pBS (Stratagene), which contains an MCS and a AMPR. C1t Constructs—The bait used for the two-hybrid screen consists of a 567-bp fragment that encodes the putative cytosolic C terminus of huNKCC1 from residue 9 after the 12th transmembrane domain to residue 197 (see Fig. 1B).

First, the 3′ region of C1t/pGilda was truncated by removing nucleotide segments between a restriction site (BsrgI, ClaI, StuI, or XbaI) that cuts in the coding sequence of the insert and a downstream restriction site (XhoI) that cuts in the MCS. BsrgI and ClaI are naturally present in C1t (bps 192–197 and 235–240), whereas StuI and XbaI were created by substitution (bps 281–286 and 501–506) using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with mutagenic primers (Table I, b and c). The final constructs (C1a, C1b, C1c, and C1d/pGilda) were generated after excising the 3′ end of the insert and ligating the vector-containing fragment pretreated with Klenow in dNTP-supplemented buffer (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). For the other approach, segments in C1t were amplified through 30 cycles of PCR with an EcoRI-capped forward primer and an XhoI-capped reverse primer (Table I, e–h). They were subsequently cloned in pGilda generating C1e, C1f, C1g, C1h, and C1i/pGilda (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). C2t Constructs—One of the interacting proteins identified in the current study (called C2t) is derived from a 729-bp fragment that encodes the distal C terminus of huNKCC1 (Table II, and see also Fig. 1C). It is cloned in the vector pB42AD behind the LexA activating domain and HA-encoding sequence. This insert was also subcloned in another vector as an EcoRI-XhoI fragment. The resulting construct, C2t/pcDNA3, should produce a radioactive prey during in vitro translation (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). Additional constructs containing shorter C2t inserts (called C2tDELs) were generated using approaches that are similar to those outlined for C1tDELs inserts. Here, the sequences removed at the 3′ end of C2t/pB42AD were between a restriction site (BsrgI, AccIII, or NcoI) that cuts in the coding sequence of C2t and a downstream restriction site (XhoI) that cuts in the MCS. AccIII and NcoI are naturally present in C2t (bps 329–334 and 484–489), whereas BsrgI was created by substitution (bps 117–122) using the QuikChange kit with mutagenic primers (Table Ii). These constructs are called C2a, C2b, and C2c/pB42AD (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). As for the PCR-derived constructs, they were produced with an EcoRI-capped forward primer and an XhoI- or BamHI-capped reverse primer (Table I, j–n). They are called C2e, C2f, C2g, C2h, and C2i/pB42AD (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). The C759–1212/pcDNA3 Construct—To study the C1t-C2t interaction in the context of an intact domain, a nucleotide segment that encodes the huNKCC1 cytosolic C terminus (residues 759–1212 corresponding to bps 2275–3634 of the coding sequence) was amplified from huNKCC1/pBS through 30 cycles of PCR with an EcoRI-capped forward primer and an XhoI-capped reverse primer (Table Io). The resulting fragment (C759–1212) was subsequently cloned in pcDNA3 (Table II, and see also Fig. 2). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—EGY48 yeasts (Y) were first transformed with the construct p8op-lacZ and seeded on -Ura plates generating the strain Yop. These cells were transformed once more with C1t/pGilda and seeded on -Ura-His plates generating YopC1t. The latter strain was subsequently tested for expression of the hybrid protein by Western blotting (see below and see Fig. 3A) and tested for autonomous reporter activation on -Leu plates containing 80 μg/ml X-galactosidase (X-gal). A search for interactors was performed by transforming YopC1t cells with a human heart library cloned in pB42AD and subjecting the transformants to two rounds of selection, first on -Ura-His-Trp plates and subsequently on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates. Resistant colonies were transferred on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates containing X-gal, and those expressing β-galactosidase activity were amplified in regular yeast medium. Prey plasmids were extracted according to well established procedures, and inserts were analyzed by automated sequencing. Two procedures were carried out to confirm the specificity of the identified interactions. First, Yop cells were transformed with a single prey/pB42AD and tested for expression of a hybrid protein by Western blotting (see below and see Fig. 3A) after selection of colonies on -Trp plates. Second, Yop cells were cotransformed with pairs of plasmids (single prey + empty pGilda versus single prey + LAM/pGilda) 2LAM, which stands for human lamin C, has been reported not to form complexes or interact with most other proteins (35Bartel P. Chien C.T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 920-924PubMed Google Scholar). and tested for reporter gene activation on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu + X-gal plates. Yeast Two-hybrid Mapping Analysis—The C1tDELs/pGilda and C2tDELs/pB42AD that were engineered by sequence excision or PCR (as detailed above) were used to identify the C1t-C2t-interacting sites more precisely. As a preliminary prerequisite for this analysis, Yop cells were transformed with truncated C1tDELs/pGilda or C2tDELs/pB42AD and tested for expression of a hybrid protein by Western blotting (see below) after selection of colonies on -Ura-His or -Ura-Trp plates, respectively. Cells expressing the heterologous protein were retransformed with a full-length C2t-bearing or C1t-bearing construct, and they were tested for their ability to grow on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates or to express β-galactosidase activity on -Ura-His-Trp + X-gal plates. Pull-down Assays—C1t-GST fusion proteins (used as bait) and GST proteins (used as control) were generated through isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction using protease-deficient BL21 E. coli cells transformed with pGEX-made constructs. They were isolated by sonication in pBS and immobilized on glutathione-coupled Sepharose (GS) beads (Amersham Biosciences). Radioactive proteins (used as prey) were synthesized from cDNA inserts/pcDNA3 using the TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The final reaction solution was (in 50 μl): 1 μg of cDNA, 40 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate premixed with amino acids, and 0.4 mCi/ml [35S]Met or 20 μm cold Met. A fraction of the proteins synthesized were also treated with a phosphorylation mix using the following reaction solution (in 100 μl): radioactive prey (1:5 dilution), protein kinase A or protein kinase C mixture (2 μg/ml diluted in appropriate buffers), ATP (100 μm), and for some of the reactions, [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/ml). The pull-down assay as such was carried out by incubating ∼2 μg of proteins immobilized on GS beads with 10 μl of labeled prey for 16 h at 4 °C in a binding buffer (100–200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5–2.0% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6–8) followed by several washes in the same buffer. Protein Analyses—Radioactive prey bound to GS beads or whole cell extract proteins derived from yeast or bacteria were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide Tricine gels and revealed by Coomassie Blue staining, direct autoradiography, or chemiluminescence. For the latter procedure, detection was carried out on blots of the Tricine gels using various Abs. Whole cell extract proteins were quantified with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), whereas protein bands separated by gel electrophoresis were quantified numerically (using known concentrations of albumin in some experiments) with the NIH program Scion Image Beat 4.0.2. Sequence Analyses—The bp content of cloned inserts was determined by automated sequencing using plasmid-derived primers (Table Ip). Blast searches, sequence alignments, and structure predictions were carried out with DNAStar (Lasergene), the PLOT program (Biff Forbush), and online programs available through NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and the BCM Search Launcher web pages. Two-hybrid Screen—The cell strain used for this experiment is called YopC1t and consists of p8op-lacZ-transformed EGY48 yeast (Yop) retransformed with a bait-bearing plasmid (C1t/pGilda), which encodes the proximal region of the huNKCC1 cytosolic C terminus. Transformation of YopC1t with a human heart library/pB42AD and selection of these cells on -Ura-His-Trp plates led to the formation of over 1 million colonies. Of these colonies, 41 grew on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu, and 32 expressed above background β-galactosidase activity on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu + X-gal. Confirmation studies in the yeast expression system revealed that the identified interactions were specific (results not shown). Interestingly, inserts found in the prey plasmids of β-galactosidase-positive -Leu-resistant colonies corresponded to the coding regions of seven different proteins. One of the inserts was a 729-nucleotide sequence that encodes the distal C terminus of huNKCC1 (Fig. 1C). This prey was termed C2t/pB42AD. Selective Two-hybrid Mapping Analysis—This study was carried out to narrow the regions in the C terminus of huNKCC1 that are responsible for the C1t-C2t interaction. The constructs that were used encode 19 different protein segments including C1t (189 residues), C2t (243 residues), truncated C1ts (C1tDELs: 52–165 residues), and truncated C2ts (C2tDELs: 36–218 residues). All of these segments (except for C1t and C2t) are illustrated in gray with models of huNKCC1 (Fig. 2A), and the nomenclature under which they are designated is provided in Table II. In Fig. 3A, Western analyses of Yop cells transformed with C1t-, C2t-, C1tDELs-, or C2tDELs-bearing constructs show that the expected hybrid proteins (probed with an anti-LexA or anti-HA Ab) are produced. Indeed, bands at the adequate molecular weight mark are visualized in all lanes except those identified as C1h and C2d, which contained no proteins. Fig. 3A also shows that within each panel, the intensity of individual bands is relatively similar. Thus, variability in cell growth or β-galactosidase activity among Yop cells that will be transformed with different combinations of constructs (see below) will not be due to variability in bait or prey expression. The behavior of Yop cells cotransformed with two constructs (C2t + C1tDELversus C1t + C2tDEL) is shown in Fig. 3B. In columns 1 and 3, cotransformants were seeded on -Ura-His-Trp-Leu plates (under which conditions cell growth will only be observed if an interaction occurs), and in columns 2 and 4, they were seeded on -Ura-His-Trp + X-gal plates (under which conditions an interaction will generate strong β-galactosidase activity). Quite surprisingly, the illustration of such maneuvers shows that only one of the C1tDELs and only one of the C2tDELs used for the mapping analysis are able to support a bait-prey association. They correspond to C1a/pGilda, which encodes most of C1t except for the last 24 residues, and to C2i/pB42AD, which encodes most of C2t except for the first 25 residues. Results of the mapping analysis are summarized in Fig. 2B1. The various protein segments that were produced in yeast (19 total) are represented by horizontal bars aligned with regions of the C terminus to which they correspond. Here, black is used to indicate that the protein segments induced strong β-galactosidase activity, and white is used to indicate that they induced no (or only weak) activity. As will be reported later in greater detail, additional protein segments were produced by in vitro translation and tested for their ability to interact with C1t in pull-down assays. For this reason, they are included in the mapping analysis described in Fig. 2B2. Here again, black is used to indicate that an interaction occurred between bait and prey. An interpretation of the mapping studies is provided schematically in Figs. 2B3 (bottom bar) and 4A, highlighting regions that are minimally required for the interaction in black, highlighting the regions that are not required in white, and highlighting the regions that may or may not be required in gray. These figures show that the essential interacting regions are dispersed over a long distance in the C terminus. In C1t, they correspond to C759–762 and C854–923 (subscripted characters indicate the residue sequence in huNKCC1), and in C2t, they correspond to C994–1072 and C1132–1211. The"
https://openalex.org/W2160973116,"Jamip1 (Jak and microtubule interacting protein), an alias of Marlin-1, was identified for its ability to bind to the FERM (band 4.1 ezrin/radixin/moesin) homology domain of Tyk2, a member of the Janus kinase (Jak) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are central elements of cytokine signaling cascades. Jamip1 belongs to a family of three genes conserved in vertebrates and is predominantly expressed in neural tissues and lymphoid organs. Jamip proteins lack known domains and are extremely rich in predicted coiled coils that mediate dimerization. In our initial characterization of Jamip1 (73 kDa), we found that it comprises an N-terminal region that targets the protein to microtubule polymers and, when overexpressed in fibroblasts, profoundly perturbs the microtubule network, inducing the formation of tight and stable bundles. Jamip1 was shown to associate with two Jak family members, Tyk2 and Jak1, in Jurkat T cells via its C-terminal region. The restricted expression of Jamip1 and its ability to associate to and modify microtubule polymers suggest a specialized function of these proteins in dynamic processes, e.g. cell polarization, segregation of signaling complexes, and vesicle traffic, some of which may involve Jak tyrosine kinases.

These receptors bind cytokines with a common α-helical bundled folding and utilize Jak proteins as their catalytic moieties in a way that recalls the functioning of receptor tyrosine kinases (1Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of the Jak proteins a decade ago much work has been done, ranging from the study of their structure/function organization, post-translational modifications, and subcellular localization to the analysis of knock-out animals and the identification of mutations and translocations responsible for immune deficiency or cancer (2Aringer M. Cheng A. Nelson J.W. Chen M. Sudarshan C. Zhou Y.J. O'Shea J.J. Life Sci. 1999; 64: 2173-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene. 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). These studies have validated the essential role of Jak enzymes in cytokine signaling and helped in understanding their specificity of action. Jak proteins contain an N-terminal FERM (band 4.1 ezrin/radixin/moesin) homology domain, a putative Src homology 2 domain, a regulatory kinase-like domain, and a tyrosine kinase domain activated by tyrosine phosphorylation (1Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although structure/function analyses suggest a high flexibility and communication among the various parts of the molecule, no crystallographic data are yet available for any of these modular domains. The three-dimensional structures of the moesin and radixin FERM domains were shown to comprise three lobes with similarities to ubiquitin, the acyl-CoA-binding protein, and pleckstrin homology/phosphotyrosine binding-like domains (4Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 5Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In Jak proteins, the FERM domain is involved in an ill-defined, non-covalent interaction with the membrane-proximal region of cytokine receptors, and, as proposed for the ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins, it may act as a compact architectural unit with multiple binding surfaces. Jaks were reported to bind to a variety of signaling proteins such as SHP1/2, Syp, PP2A, PI3K, Fyn, Yes, Shc, Vav, and Cbl (1Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Other Jak interactors were identified by yeast two-hybrid screens, namely Socs1 (6Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T. Fujita T. Kanakura Y. Komiya S. Yoshimura A.

Hirano T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and JBP1/PRMT5, a protein methyltransferase involved in growth control (8Pollack B.P. Kotenko S.V. He W. Izotova L.S. Barnoski B.L. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31531-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Some of these complexes were shown to form in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Recent findings suggest that the binding of Jaks to cytokine receptors may occur early during biosynthesis at the level of endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi membranes, as Jaks were found to potentiate the maturation of at least some receptors (9Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Radtke S. Hermanns H.M. Haan C. Schmitz-Van De Leur H. Gascan H. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11297-11305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One family member, Tyk2, was found to stabilize a cognate receptor at the plasma membrane by reducing its rate of internalization (11Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Another family member, Jak2, was identified as a constituent of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum (12Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K. Fazel A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, the possibility is emerging that Jaks may not simply act as catalytic moieties of cytokine receptors but may be engaged in interactions with cellular constituents that affect protein assembly and transport processes. Based on these premises, we set out to identify new interactors of Tyk2 using its isolated FERM domain as bait in a two-hybrid screen of a Jurkat T cell line cDNA library. Here, we report on the identification and initial characterization of a protein, which we have designated Jamip1 (acronym of Jak and microtubule interacting protein), that defines a new class of proteins rich in coiled coils and associated with the microtubule network. Our in vivo analyses of wild type and mutated forms of Jamip1 suggest that the protein comprises at least two distinct functional domains, an N-terminal microtubule binding region and a C-terminal regulatory region that can associate with the FERM homology domains of Tyk2 and Jak1. These results, together with the restricted expression of Jamip1 and its paralogue, Jamip2, in neuronal and lymphoid tissues suggest a specialized function of these proteins in processes involving Jak kinases and the dynamic microtubule network. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The FERM domain of human Tyk2 (aa 1-451) was cloned in pGBT9 and used as bait in the HF7 yeast strain transformed with a human Jurkat cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). 106 transformants were plated on medium lacking histidine. Colonies were then tested for β-galactosidase activity. Transformants were cured of the bait plasmid and re-tested for specific interaction. Yeast plasmid DNA was isolated, rescued into Escherichia coli XL-1, re-transformed into the bait-containing yeast strain, and assayed again. Plasmid Constructs—The full-length Jamip1 coding sequence was obtained by reverse PCR using as template human brain cDNA (Clontech) and cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His/neo (Invitrogen) and p3×FLAG-CMV (Sigma). The N-ter sequence was obtained by PCR using as template pcDNA3-Jamip1. The C-ter sequence, obtained by PCR using as template the yeast clone, retains the original HA tag. Both PCR products were subcloned in pcDNA4/V5-His/zeo (Invitrogen). To assay tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), we used a C-ter expression plasmid in which the HA tag was removed by deleting a HindIII-BamHI fragment. GST-FERMJakI was obtained by subcloning the amplified human Jak1 FERM (aa 2-427) in pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Fragments derived from PCR were sequenced. Plasmid pcDNA4/V5-His-LacZ (Invitrogen) was used for of β-galactosidase expression. Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple tissue Northern membranes (Clontech) were probed with 3′ human (coding nucleotides 1228-1878, GenBank™ AK056126) and murine (coding nucleotides 1299-1878, GenBank™ AK077298) Jamip1 probes or a 3′ human Jamip2 probe (coding nucleotides 1784-2285, GenBank™ AB011127). An actin probe was used to assess equal loading. Membranes were hybridized as suggested by the manufacturer and exposed at -80 °C for 2-3 days for the Jamip probes and 3 h for actin. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 and 293T cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Jurkat cells were kept in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% fetal calf serum. Unless otherwise stated, transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation (11Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Stable N-ter and C-ter clones were derived from HT-1080 and selected in zeocin (800 mg/ml). Jamip1-expressing clones were selected in neomycin (400 mg/ml). Calyculin A was purchased from Alexis Corp., and nocodazole and Taxol were from Sigma. Antibodies and Protein Analysis—Rabbit polyclonal antisera J1269-286 and J1609-626 were generated against Jamip1 peptides (aa 269-286 and aa 609-626). Antiserum J1269-286 was peptide affinity-purified. Anti-V5 mAb was from Invitrogen. mAbs specific for the FLAG and HA epitopes α-tubulin and acetylated tubulin were from Sigma, anti-β-tubulin was from Roche Applied Science, 4G10 was from UBI, the anti-Tyk2 T10-2 mAb was as described (11Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Alcover A. Eid P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and the anti-Jak1 mAb (MAB3700) was from Chemicon International. Cell lysates were prepared as described (13Gauzzi M.C. Velazquez L. McKendry R. Mogensen K.E. Fellous M. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20494-20500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton-X100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Immunoblots were revealed with an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantified by scanning with the Kodak Image Station 440CF. Luciferase Reporter Assay—293T cells (2 × 105 per 35-mm dish) were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche). The ISG54-luciferase construct (100 ng) was co-transfected with the pcDNA4 vector, Jamip1 (1 μg), N-ter (0.5 μg), or C-ter (2 μg). After 48 h, cells were treated with recombinant IFN-α2b (from D. Gewert). Luciferase activity was quantified in a luminometer (EG & E Berthold) as described (14Dondi E. Pattyn E. Lutfalla G. Van Ostade X. Uze G. Pellegrini S. Tavernier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47004-47012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Vitro Interaction Assay—In vitro transcription-translation was performed using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, in the presence of l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro translated proteins (2-10 μl) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing ∼3 μg of bound proteins in 100 μl of binding buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. Beads were washed 3× in binding buffer and once in detergent-free buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Detergent Extraction Assay—Adherent cells were washed in PHEM (45 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 45 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA) and extracted for 5 min at room temperature with 400 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM and protease inhibitors. The supernatant (soluble) was collected. The detergent-insoluble matrix remaining on the dish was washed in PHEM, extracted in 400 μl of Laemmli buffer, scraped, and harvested (insoluble). For cells pretreated with drugs, all washes were with the drug. Equal volumes of soluble and insoluble samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Western blot. 5 × 106 Jurkat cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with drugs, pelleted, transferred to 2-ml tubes, and extracted as described above, except that the soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. Fluorescent Microscopy—HT-1080 cells were transfected on glass coverslips with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and processed as described (15Ragimbeau J. Dondi E. Vasserot A. Romero P. Uze G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30812-30818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Extraction prior to fixation was performed in 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm MES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA (16Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2597-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were seeded (4 × 105) on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, centrifuged for 1 min at 47 × g, fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin. Anti-V5 and anti-α-tubulin mAbs were used at 4 μg/ml, anti-β-tubulin mAb at 1 μg/ml, and anti-acetylated tubulin at 5 μg/ml. mAbs were revealed with Alexa594-coupled IgG1 secondary Abs (Molecular Probes) at 2 μg/ml. J1269-286 and J1609-626 antisera were used at 1:500 and 1:100 dilutions, respectively. Affinity purified J1269-286 Abs were used at 5 μg/ml. Rabbit primary Abs were revealed with Alexa488-coupled secondary Abs (Molecular Probes) at 4 μg/ml. Confocal microscopy analyses (Figs. 5A and 6, A and B) were performed with a Zeiss LSM-510 microscope, Z-series of optical sections were performed at 0.5 μm increments. Images were acquired with settings allowing the maximum signal detection below the saturation limits. A middle optical section is shown. For double staining, sequential acquisitions were performed to avoid fluorescence contamination between the two channels. For the other figures, visualization was with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope (40× oil immersion lens). Images were captured with a Hamamatsu Orca II CCD camera and analyzed using AquaCosmos software. Cloning of Jamip1, a Member of a Novel Family—As a step further in the study of Jak proteins, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins interacting with the FERM homology domain of Tyk2. The bait comprised the entire FERM domain of Tyk2, and the cDNA library was from Jurkat T cells. One positive clone encoded a partial protein of 261 aa flanked by a 3′-untranslated region of 213 nucleotides. From data base searches, several matching human and murine expressed sequence tags were found, all originating from neural tissue. The entire coding sequence was cloned by reverse PCR using adult human brain cDNA as the template (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence encodes a protein of 626 aa with a predicted mass of 73.1 kDa that was designated Jamip1 (see below). Recently, Couve et al. reported the identification by yeast two-hybrid screen of a neuronal specific protein that can associate with the R1 subunit of the GABAB receptor (17Couve A. Restituito S. Brandon J.M. Charles K.J. Bawagan H. Freeman K.B. Pangalos M.N. Calver A.R. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13934-13943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This novel protein, named Marlin-1, is identical to Jamip1 (see “Discussion”). BLAST searches with the Jamip1 coding sequence predicted the existence of three highly related human genes with a conserved intron-exon organization (data not shown). Orthologues of the three Jamip genes were found in the murine genome. The chromosomal location and the available mRNA accession number of the human and the murine genes are shown in Table I. An alignment of the three predicted human proteins is shown in Fig. 1. Note that, at the present time, limited data base information is available for Jamip3, and its amino acid sequence was therefore derived by comparative analysis of the genomic sequence with the coding sequences of Jamip1 and Jamip2. Jamip1 shares 58% aa identity with Jamip2 and the predicted Jamip3. The aa identity between the predicted human and murine proteins ranges from 66% for Jamip3 to 97% for Jamip1. Three Jamip-related genes were found in fish, but none were found in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans.Table IMembers of the Marlin/Jamip familyGene name/aliasChromosomal locationmRNA accession numberUnigeneHumanMouseHumanMouseHumanMouseMarlin1/Jamip14p16.25 B3 cMAK056126AK077298Hs. 101672Mm. 303004AY382340KIAA0555/Jamip25q3218 B3 cMAB011127XM_129010Hs. 43107Mm. 329404AF273057aPutative isoform.Jamip3bPredicted.10q26.112 A1.1 cMUnknownXM_137957UnknownUnknowna Putative isoform.b Predicted. Open table in a new tab Profile of Jamip1 and Jamip2 Expression—The mRNA expression profile of Jamip1 was analyzed in panels of human and murine tissues. Using 3′-specific Jamip1 probes, a single transcript of ∼2.5 kb was found highly expressed in adult brain and testis. Weaker signals were detected in other tissues (spleen, peripheral blood lymphocytes, lung, and intestine) (Fig. 2, A and B). Jamip2 expression in human tissues was also analyzed. A major transcript of >4 kb was highly expressed in brain, moderately expressed in thymus, spleen and lung, and weakly expressed in kidney, liver, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 2A). Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against two Jamip1-specific peptides (Fig. 1). Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analyses using either antisera revealed a single 73-kDa band in Jurkat cells, T cell blasts, Daudi (B lymphoblasts), and NKL, a natural killer cell line. No protein was detected in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, THP1 monocytic, or Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. The antisera revealed two specific bands in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and mouse brain extract (Fig. 2D). Thus, Jamip1 appears predominantly expressed in lymphoid cells in addition to neural tissues. Jamip1 Can Homodimerize—Jamip proteins lack known conserved domains but are extremely rich in predicted α-helical coiled coils of varying lengths that are interrupted by non-helical regions ranging from 38 to 140 residues (Figs. 1 and 3A). Jamip1 contains two leucine zipper motifs, one of which is conserved in the family. Because coiled coil regions are known to serve as dimerization domains, we analyzed the ability of Jamip1, differentially tagged, to homodimerize in co-immunoprecipitation assays. FLAG-tagged Jamip1 was found to interact with V5-tagged Jamip1 but not with the control β-galactosidase protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4). Truncated forms of Jamip1, comprising either the N-ter or the C-ter portion (Fig. 3A), were generated and tested in this assay. Both forms were found to associate with full-length Jamip1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). We also analyzed the ability of C-ter to interact with itself or with N-ter. As shown in Fig. 3C, the C-ter could self-associate but was unable to interact with the N-terminal region. Altogether, these data demonstrate that Jamip1 can homodimerize via the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions. Interaction between Jamip1 and Jak Proteins—To confirm the interaction between Jamip1 and Tyk2 in a context other than that of yeast, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of the two endogenous proteins from Jurkat T cells. As seen in Fig. 4A, endogenous Tyk2 (134 kDa) was brought down with the anti-Jamip1 serum. Moreover, in 293T cells endogenous Tyk2 was shown to associate with transfected Jamip1 and C-ter but not with N-ter (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that both endogenous and ectopically expressed Jamip1 could associate with endogenous Tyk2 via the C-terminal portion. Next, we asked whether Jamip1 could interact with the other three Jak proteins expressed in Jurkat cells. Experiments performed with a panel of rabbit anti-Jak2 and Jak3 antisera did not yield conclusive results. On the other hand, endogenous Jak1, detected with a monoclonal Ab, was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Jamip1 (Fig. 4C). The ability of Jamip1 to interact specifically with the Jak1 FERM domain was also monitored. For this monitoring, the Jak1 FERM was expressed as a GST fusion protein and incubated with in vitro translated Jamip1 or control β-galactosidase. As shown in Fig. 4D, the fusion protein retained Jamip1 but not β-galactosidase. Thus, Jamip1 can interact with the FERM domains of both Tyk2 and Jak1. Given the well described involvement of Tyk2 and Jak1 in IFN-α/β signaling (18Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the forced expression of Jamip1 constructs in 293T cells interfered with IFN-α signaling. Cells were co-transfected with an IFN-inducible luciferase reporter and Jamip1, N-ter, or C-ter. At high IFN doses, a 50% decrease in luciferase induction was consistently observed in cells transfected with Jamip1 or C-ter (Fig. 4D). Thus, overexpression of Jamip1 perturbed the transcriptional response to high IFN doses, i.e. upon high receptor occupancy. This finding provided additional evidence of the capacity of ectopically expressed Jamip1 or C-ter to interact with endogenous Jak proteins. Jamip1 Associates with the Microtubule Cytoskeleton via the N-terminal Region—The subcellular localization of endogenous Jamip1 was studied in Jurkat T cells by confocal microscopy using affinity-purified anti-peptide polyclonal Abs. Staining was observed in organized filamentous structures that resembled the microtubule network as well as in non-fibrous structures enriched in the cortex areas. To monitor a possible association with microtubules, we co-stained Jamip1 and tubulin. A clear overlap was observed, with Jamip1 heavily decorating microtubules (Fig. 5A, sections a-c). Next, we analyzed HT-1080 cells transiently transfected with Jamip1. A mild Triton X-100 extraction was performed prior to fixation to remove cytosolic proteins and preserve membrane-cytoskeletal associations. Co-localization of Jamip1 with tubulin was evident using either anti-Jamip1 Abs (Fig. 5A, sections d-f) or anti-V5 mAb (data not shown). Both Jamip1 and tubulin filamentous staining patterns were disrupted by the addition of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole (see Fig. 6B, sections a and b), demonstrating that Jamip1 and polymerized microtubules are closely associated. It was noteworthy that, whereas tubulin staining disappeared, Jamip1 collapsed in a diffuse, non-filamentous pattern. Thus, the solubilization property of the protein in Triton X-100 did not depend solely on the presence of assembled microtubules. To define which portion of Jamip1 directs its localization, we analyzed cells transfected with N-ter or C-ter. On cells permeabilized prior to fixation, N-ter was observed in association with stained interphase microtubules (Fig. 5B, sections a and b), and C-ter appeared predominantly nuclear (data not shown). In non-permeabilized cells the N-ter staining was unchanged, but C-ter appeared to be diffuse in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in a non-filamentous pattern (Fig. 5B, sections c and d). These results demonstrate that Jamip1 associates with the microtubule network via its N-terminal region. Jamip1 Influences Microtubule Dynamics—In the course of these studies we noticed that, in cells expressing a high level of N-ter, microtubules assumed a wavy appearance with a high density of closely spaced and looped bundles (Fig. 6A). To further analyze the effects of Jamip1 and N-ter on microtubule organization, transiently transfected cells were challenged with nocodazole. A gentle nocodazole treatment (1 μm for 10 min) was sufficient to induce a complete microtubule depolymerization in the majority of Jamip1-expressing cells, whereas filamentous structures, resulting from incomplete depolymerization, were visible in untransfected cells (Fig. 6B, sections a and b). This result was indicative of the enhanced nocodazole sensitivity of Jamip1-expressing cells. Conversely, in N-ter-expressing cells doubly stained circular microtubule bundles were preserved even upon a stronger nocodazole treatment (10 μm for 60 min) (Fig. 6B, sections c and d). To substantiate this result, we compared the nocodazole sensitivity of a stable N-ter clone and control cells. Lengthy residual tubulin polymers were consistently more abundant in N-ter-expressing cells than in control HT-1080 parental cells (Fig. 6C). Because modification of tubulin subunits by acetylation marks older and more stable microtubules (19Piperno G. LeDizet M. Chang X.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of N-ter on microtubule stability by monitoring levels of acetylated tubulin. In N-ter-expressing cells, a strong acetylated tubulin staining was evident as compared with the weak or undetectable staining of untransfected cells (Fig. 6D). The interaction between Jamip1 and microtubules was further investigated by biochemical fractionation and analysis of the distribution of tubulin and Jamip1. We used a gentle extraction protocol that removes soluble proteins to leave intact the cytoskeleton framework and the associated proteins (20Infante C. Ramos-Morales F. Fedriani C. Bornens M. Rios R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In a stable clone, Jamip1 resided in the detergent-insoluble fraction, whereas tubulin was equally distributed between soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of cells with nocodazole (10 μm, 4 h) resulted in a nearly complete shift of tubulin from the insoluble to the soluble fraction, whereas only a minor pool of Jamip1 was solubilized (Fig. 7A, lanes 3 and 4). Endogenous Jamip1 behaved similarly, as assessed by the analysis of Jurkat cells (Fig. 7B). Thus, the distribution of Jamip1 only partly matched the distribution of tubulin, and its insolubility could only in part be attributed to its association with microtubules. Despite the drastic effect exerted by N-ter on microtubules (Fig. 6), when fractionation experiments were performed with cells transiently expressing N-ter, no changes in the distribution of tubulin could be observed with respect to control β-galactosidase transfected cells (Fig. 7C, upper sections). In view of the possibility that the fraction of N-ter-stabilized microtubules was too small to lead to a detectable shift in the distribution of total tubulin, we monitored the distribution of acetylated tubulin (Fig. 7C, lower sections). The amount of acetylated tubulin in the soluble fractions was comparable in the two transfected populations. However, the amount of acetylated, polymerized tubulin in the insoluble fractions was consistently higher in N-ter-transfected cells, and this finding was more evident upon nocodazole treatment (Fig. 7C, lower sections, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 9 and 10). These results show that the N-terminal region is able to induce unique changes in microtubule organization, enhancing the pool of acetylated tubulin and reducing the sensitivity of microtubules to a depolymerizing agent. Both of these effects are indicative of an increased microtubule stability. It is well known that the activity of various microtubule-associated proteins and their affinity to microtub"

Two classes of methionine sulfoxide reductases, called MsrA and MsrB, exist that display opposite stereoselectivities toward the sulfoxide function. Although they are structurally unrelated, they share a similar chemical mechanism that includes three steps with 1) formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate with a concomitant release of 1 mol of methionine per mole of enzyme; 2) formation of an intradisulfide Msr bond; and 3) reduction of the oxidized Msr by thioredoxin. In the MsrBs that have been biochemically, enzymatically, and structurally characterized so far, the cysteine involved in the regeneration of the catalytic Cys-117 is Cys-63. Cys-117 is located on a β strand, whereas the recycling Cys-63 is on a loop near Cys-117. The distance between the two cysteines is compatible with formation of the Cys-117/Cys-63 intradisulfide bond. Analyses of MsrB sequences show that at least 37% of the MsrBs do not possess the recycling Cys-63. In the present study, it is shown that Cys-31 in the Xanthomonas campestris MsrB, which is located on another loop, can efficiently substitute for Cys-63. Such a result implies flexibility of the MsrB structures, at least of the loops on which Cys-31 or Cys-63 are located. The fact that about 25% of the putative MsrBs have no recycling cysteine supports other recycling processes in which thioredoxin is not operative.

This step was shown to be overall rate-limiting for both classes of Msrs (16Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Inspection of the alignment of the sequences of MsrBs deduced from the DNA sequences show that, as expected, the catalytic Cys-117 on which the sulfenic acid intermediate is formed, is invariant, including SelR MsrB in which Cys-117 is a Sec residue. In contrast, the recycling Cys-63 from Neisseria meningitidis which was shown to be involved in the regeneration of the Cys-117 through formation of an intradisulfide bond followed by reduction by Trx, is present in only 63% of the MsrB sequences (see Fig. 1). The absence of the recycling Cys-63 in the remaining MsrBs suggests an alternative mechanism of regeneration of the reductase activity for these MsrBs, in vivo. In the crystal structure of the MsrBs from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (9Lowther W.T. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar) and N. meningitidis, 2B. Kauffmann, unpublished results. Cys-117 is situated on a β strand, whereas Cys-63 is located within a loop. The distance between the sulfur atoms of both cysteines is compatible with the catalytic mechanism and in particular with formation of the Cys-117/Cys-63 intradisulfide bond. Two hypotheses can be postulated to explain the activity of MsrBs devoid of the recycling Cys-63. In the first one, the sulfenic acid on Cys-117 is reduced by either Trx or another reductant. An alternative is the participation of another cysteine that would play a role similar to that of Cys-63. In this case, this implies a conformational flexibility of the MsrB structures and a positioning of the recycling cysteine compatible not only with an efficient formation of an intradisulfide bond with Cys-117 but also with an efficient reduction of the disulfide bond by Trx. In the present study, we show that the Xanthomonas campestris MsrB, which does not possess Cys-63, exhibits an efficient Trx-recycling process. Cys-31, which is situated in a loop different from that on which is located Cys-63, is shown to play a role in the Trx-recycling process similar to that of Cys-63 of the N. meningitidis enzyme. Conversely, the C63S MsrB from N. meningitidis, in which a cysteine is introduced at position 31, is shown to be almost as active in the Trx-recycling process as the wild type. These results and those obtained with C31S/T63C MsrB from X. campestris are discussed on the basis of the crystal structure of the N. gonorrhoeae MsrB. Plasmid Constructions, Site-directed Mutagenesis, Production, and Purification of X. campestris and N. meningitidis Wild Type and Mutants—Plasmid pSKMsrBXc was obtained by cloning the msrB open reading frame synthesized by PCR (GC-rich system, Roche Applied Science; sequences of oligonucleotides not shown) using X. campestris ATCC 13951 genomic DNA, kindly provided by Dr. S. Leduc and Dr. N. D. Lindley, into the plasmid pDB125KSNN between the NdeI and SacI sites (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The other recombinant pSKMrsB plasmids were already described (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M.

Site-directed mutagenesis were performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Escherichia coli strain used for X. campestris and N. meningitidis MsrB productions was BE002 (MG1655 msrA::specΩ, msrB::α3kana), transformed with the plasmidic construction pSKMsrB containing the coding sequence of the corresponding msrB gene under the lac promoter. The BE002 strain was kindly provided by Dr. F. Barras. Its use prevented expression of endogenous wild-type MsrB from E. coli. This is supported by the fact that overexpressed C117S MsrB did not display any detectable MsrB activity. For MsrBs, excepted N. meningitidis S31C/C63S MsrB, the protocol of purification was carried out as previously described for PILB-MsrB (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the case of the N. meningitidis S31C/C63S MsrB, the enzyme was found after sonication and centrifugation in the pellet. The pellet was solubilized in a minimal volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 20 mm dithiothreitol and 6 m urea. The enzyme was then renatured against a dialysis gradient buffer A containing decreasing concentrations of urea from 3 to 0 m. The solution was then applied onto an ACA 54 resin (buffer A). Purified fractions were pooled and applied onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A, followed by a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.4 m) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). MsrB was eluted at 100 mm KCl. Purified fractions were pooled and finally applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A, containing 1 m (NH4)2SO4. N. meningitidis S31C/C63S MsrB was eluted with a linear gradient from 1 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A. At this stage, wild-type and mutant MsrBs were pure, as checked by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The predicted mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry analyses. Storage of the enzymes was done as previously described (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A.

The molecular concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm deduced from the method of Scopes (18Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) of 9,710 m–1·cm–1 for X. campestris wild-type and C31S/T63C MsrBs and 17,330 m–1·cm–1 for N. meningitidis wild-type, C63S, and S31C/C63S MsrBs. In the paper, N. meningitidis and X. campestris MsrB amino acid numbering are based on the E. coli MsrB sequence in which the N-terminal Met is omitted. Trx1 and Trx reductases from E. coli were prepared following experimental procedures already published (19Mulrooney S.B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 9: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Mossner E. Huber-Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Determination of Metal Content—The zinc and iron contents of wild-type X. campestris MsrB were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. In parallel, analyses of control buffer samples showed that zinc and iron concentrations were less than 72 μg·liter–1. Quantification of the Free Cysteine Content with 5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitro)benzoate—Cysteine content of MsrBs and Trx was determined using DTNB under nondenaturing conditions in buffer A and denaturing conditions (final concentration of 1% SDS in buffer A) after incubation, or not, with 150 mm dl-Met-R,S-SO without the addition of any exogenous reducing system as previously described (13Olry A.

Characterization of the Sulfenic Acid Intermediate on the X. campestris C31S MsrB—The sulfenic acid intermediate was characterized spectrophotometrically by using thionitrobenzoate (TNB–) under non-denaturing conditions. This approach took advantage of the unique reactivity of sulfenic acids toward nucleophiles such as TNB–. TNB– was prepared by reducing the corresponding disulfide using the procedure of Silver (21Silver M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The progress curve of TNB– disappearance for X. campestris C31S MsrB was recorded at 412 nm in buffer A. Enzyme concentrations were 7.35 and 14.7 μm, and the TNB– concentration was 60 μm. The amount of TNB– consumed was calculated using an extinction coefficient at 412 nm of 13,600 m–1·cm–1. Preparation of MsrBs and Trx in Oxidized Disulfide State—Oxidation of MsrBs was achieved by mixing 100 μm reduced MsrB (MsrBred) with 300 mm MetSO in buffer A. The MetSO used was dl-Met-R,S-SO of which only the R isomer is a substrate for MsrB. Oxidation of Trx was achieved by mixing 500 μm reduced Trx (Trxred) with 1 mm DTNB in buffer A. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the oxidized proteins were passed through an Econo-Pac 10 DG desalting column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. The state of oxidation was checked by titration with DTNB. Preparation of Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe—Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe was prepared from Ac-l-Met-OMe (Bachem) as previously described (17Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The proton NMR spectrum is in accordance with the Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe structure: 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz), δ 7.63–7.60 (m, 1H, NH-Me), 7.01–6.90 (m, 1H, Ac-NH), 4.66–4.59 (m, 1H, CH), 2.95–2.55 (m with 3s at 2.80, 2.66, and 2.60, 8H, N-CH3, SOCH3, CH2-SO), 2.31–2.25 (m, 2H, CH2), and 2.03 (s, 3H, CH3CO). Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic parameters were determined under steady-state conditions with the Trx recycling system (1.28 μmE. coli Trx reductase and 0.3 mm NADPH), with saturating concentration of Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe and by varying the concentrations of Trxred, or with saturating concentration of Trxred and by varying the concentrations of Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe. Initial rate measurements were carried out at 25 °C in buffer A on a Kontron Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer by following the decrease of the absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH. Initial rate data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten relationship using least squares analysis to determine kcat value and Km for Trxred and Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe. It should be mentioned that Km for Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe has to be divided by 2, because the S isomer is not a substrate. Fluorescence Properties of Wild-type and C31S MsrBs from X. campestris and Trx—The fluorescence characteristics of 1) the wild-type MsrB in its reduced form and Cys-117/Cys-31 disulfide state, 2) the C31S MsrB in its reduced form and Cys-117 sulfenic acid state, and 3) Trx in its reduced and disulfide state were recorded on a spectrofluorometer (flx SAFAS) thermostatted at 25 °C (see legends of Figs. 2 and 3 for more details).Fig. 3Fluorescence emission spectra of E. coli Trxred and Trxox and of X. campestris MsrBred and MsrBox.

The excitation wavelength was set at 293 nm, and the emitted light was collected above 320 nm, using a cutoff filter. One syringe contained MsrB in buffer A (10 μm final concentration after mixing), and the other one contained Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe (100 mm final concentration). An average of six runs was recorded. Rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential Equation 1 in which c represents the end point, a, the amplitude of the fluorescence increase (<0) and kobs the rate constant. y=ae−kobst+c (Eq. 1) Determination of the Rate of Ac-l-Met-NHMe Formation by Single Turnover Quenched-flow Experiments—Quenched-flow measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a SX18MV-R stopped-flow apparatus (Applied PhotoPhysics) fitted for the double-mixing mode and adapted to recover the quenched samples as previously described (16Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes (60 μl) of a solution containing 600 μm MsrB in 50 mm MES, pH 5.5 (for the N. meningitidis enzyme), or in buffer A (for the X. campestris enzymes) and a solution containing 700 mm Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe in 50 mm MES, pH 5.5 (for the N. meningitidis enzyme), or 200 mm Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe in buffer A (for the X. campestris enzymes) were mixed in the aging loop. The mixtures were then allowed to react for 40–5000 ms before being mixed with an equal volume of a quenching aqueous solution containing 2% of trifluoroacetic acid. Quenched samples were then collected in a 200-μl loop. For each aging time, four shots were done, and the four corresponding quenched samples were pooled in a volume of 700 μl. Trifluoroacetic acid (100%, 50 μl) was then added to 200 μl of the quenched samples to precipitate the protein. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. Ac-l-Met-NHMe quantification in the resulting supernatant was carried out by reverse phase chromatography as described previously (17Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In parallel, the quenched samples, which were not treated with 100% trifluoroacetic acid, were used to determine the protein concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm. For Ac-l-Met-NHMe titration, data were plotted as moles of Ac-l-Met-NHMe formed per mole of MsrB as a function of time. The rate of Ac-l-Met-NHMe formation was determined by fitting the curve to the monoexponential Equation 2 in which a represents the maximum fraction of Ac-l-Met-NHMe formed per mole of MsrB and kobs, the rate constant. y=a(1−e−kobst) (Eq. 2) Kinetics of Formation of Oxidized Trx (Trxox) upon the Reduction of the X. campestris MsrB Cys-117/Cys-31 and Cys-117/Cys-63 Disulfide Bonds and of the N. meningitidis MsrB Cys-117/Cys-31 Disulfide Bond under Single Turnover Conditions—Two approaches were used depending on the rate of the kinetics. When the rate was rapid as observed with the X. campestris wild-type and N. meningitidis S31C/C63S MsrB, kinetic measurements were determined on a stopped-flow apparatus by following selectively the quenching of the fluorescence emission of Trx associated with the formation of its Cys-32/Cys-35 disulfide bond upon the reduction of oxidized MsrB (MsrBox), as previously described for MsrA (16Antoine M. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45352-45357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and more recently for the MsrB from N. meningitidis (17Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11616-11622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm, and the emitted light was collected above 320 nm, using a cutoff filter. One syringe contained the MsrBox in buffer A, and the other one contained Trxred at various concentrations in buffer A. An average of six runs was recorded for each concentration of Trxred. When the rate was low as observed with the X. campestris C31S/T63C MsrB, the Trx fluorescence quenching associated with formation of its Cys-32/Cys-35 disulfide bond upon reduction of the MsrB Cys-117/Cys-63 disulfide bond was carried out at 25 °C on a spectrofluorometer (flx SAFAS). The excitation wavelength was set at 310 nm, and the emitted light was collected at 340 nm with an adapted voltage. In both approaches, rate constants, kobs, were obtained by fitting fluorescence traces with the monoexponential Equation 1 with a > 0. kobs values were fit to Equation 3 using least squares analysis to determine kr, kf, and K for Trxred. S represents the Trxred concentration, K represents the Ks values for Trxred, and kr and kf represent the rate constants of the disulfide exchange in the reverse and forward directions, respectively. MsrBox+Trxred⇌K[MsrBox … Trxred]⇌krkf[MsrBred … Trxox] REACTION 1 kobs=kr+kfS/(K+S) (Eq. 3) Equation 3 was used, assuming that binding of Trxred to MsrBox is rapid equilibrium. Biochemical Properties of Wild-type, C31S/T63C, and C31S MsrBs from X. campestris and of S31C/C63S MsrB from N. meningitidis—DTNB thiol titrations on the X. campestris wild-type MsrBred revealed six cysteines under denaturating conditions. These results are in agreement with the X. campestris ATCC 13951 DNA sequence that indicates six cysteines at positions 31, 45, 48, 94, 97, and 117 (Fig. 1). Under native conditions, only two cysteines were reactive (Table I). Metal analyses of the purified enzyme by atomic emission spectrometry showed the presence of zinc in a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol per mole of enzyme. The presence of iron, less than 0.05 mol per mole of enzyme was also detected. As shown from the inspection of the x-ray structure, a putative Zn2+-binding site is present in the N. gonorrhoeae MsrB (9Lowther W.T. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 348-352PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming a fold similar to that of the N. gonorrhoeae MsrB, the metal binding site of the X. campestris MsrB is composed of the two CXXC motifs with Cys-45, Cys-48, Cys-94, and Cys-97 and is situated in an opposite direction from the active site. Therefore, the accessible cysteines in the X. campestris MsrB are likely Cys-31 and Cys-117, the latter being the catalytic cysteine on which the sulfenic acid is formed. Also two cysteines were reactive in the C31S/T63C MsrBred indicating that the Cys-63 is accessible to DTNB. In the case of the C31S MsrBred, only one cysteine, Cys-117, is shown to be accessible (Table I). Finally, two cysteines are also reactive in the S31C/C63S MsrBred from N. meningitidis. This showed that the introduced Cys-31 is also accessible, as is the case for Cys-63 in the wild type (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J.

Open table in a new tab Enzymatic Properties of the Wild-type and C31S MsrBs from X. campestris—The activity of the wild type was tested with Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe as a substrate to evaluate the kinetics of the reductase step at saturating concentration of the substrate. Surprisingly, a turnover activity was observed in the presence of Trxred and Trx reductase. This raised the question of the Msr intermediate entities reduced by Trxred. A possibility was a reduction of the sulfenic acid intermediate by Trxred. An alternative was the reduction of a disulfide bond. The latter possibility implied that Cys-31 forms a disulfide bond with Cys-117. To better characterize the catalytic mechanism, the kinetic constants were first determined under steady-state conditions using the Trx reductase recycling system at pH 8.0. Km for Ac-l-Met-R,S-SO-NHMe and Trxred, and kcat values were 6 mm, 5.7 μm, and 2.5 s–1, respectively (Table II). Some significant differences are observed from what was published for the N. meningitidis MsrB (13Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S. Van Dorsselear A. Branlant G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12016-12022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In particular, Km for Trxred is 6-fold lower, and the kcat value is increased by a factor of 5. The rate of Ac-l-Met-NHMe formation was then studied under single turnover conditions in the absence of Trx using the same approach as already described for MsrA and MsrB from N. meningitidis (16Antoine M.

https://openalex.org/W2001475642,"Angiopoietins are a family of factors that play important roles in angiogenesis, and their receptor, Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed primarily by endothelial cells. Three angiopoietins have been identified so far, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopietin-2 (Ang-2), and angiopoietin-3 (Ang-3). It has been established that Ang-1 and Tie-2 play essential roles in embryonic angiogenesis. We have demonstrated recently that, unlike Ang-2, Ang-1 binds to the extracellular matrix, which regulates the availability and activity of Ang-1 (Xu, Y., and Yu, Q. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 34990-34998). However, the role and biochemical characteristics of Ang-3 are unknown. In our current study, we demonstrated that, unlike Ang-1 and Ang-2, Ang-3 is tethered on cell surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), especially perlecan. The cell surface-bound Ang-3 is capable of binding to its receptor, Tie-2; suggesting HSPGs concentrate Ang-3 on the cell surface and present Ang-3 to its receptor to elicit specific local reaction. Mutagenesis experiment revealed that the coiled-coil domain of Ang-3 is responsible for its binding to the cell surface. In addition, we demonstrated that the cell surface-bound Ang-3 but not soluble Ang-3 induces retraction and loss of integrity of endothelial monolayer, indicating the binding of Ang-3 to the cell surface via HSPGs is required for this bioactivity of Ang-3.

However, how Ang-3 affects endothelial cell behavior and how bioactivity of Ang-3 is regulated have not been established. We have demonstrated previously that Ang-2 is primarily secreted and that Ang-1 is incorporated into the ECM and the ECM binding of Ang-1 regulates its availability and activity (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In our current study, we demonstrated that, unlike Ang-1 and Ang-2, Ang-3 is tethered on cell surface via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), especially perlecan, through the coiled-coil domain of Ang-3. Perlecan is an HSPG that is present in the basement membrane and on the cell surface (21Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Perlecan binds to the cell surface through integrin (22Battaglia C. Aumailley M. Mann K. Mayer U. Timpl R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 92-99PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chakravarti S. Horchar T.

Invest. 2001; 108: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 31Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the cell surface-bound Ang-3 is capable of binding to Tie-2-Fc fusion protein. More importantly, the cell surface-bound Ang-3 but not soluble Ang-3 induces retraction and loss of integrity of the endothelial monolayer, indicating that the cell surface binding of Ang-3 is required for its function. We have shown very recently that overexpression of Ang-3 inhibits pulmonary metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma and TA3 mammary carcinoma cells by blocking tumor angiogenesis and promoting apoptosis of tumor cells (45Xu Y. Liu Y.-j. Yu Q. Cancer Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that tethering Ang-3 on the cell surface is required for effective inhibition of Ang-3 on tumor angiogenesis and pulmonary metastasis (45Xu Y. Liu Y.-j. Yu Q. Cancer Res. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). These results further confirmed that binding of Ang-3 to the cell surface via HSPGs enhances/facilitates the bioactivity of Ang-3. The results reported in our previous study (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and current study demonstrate that angiopoietins not only play different roles in regulating endothelial cell function, but also their activities are differentially regulated by the ECM and HSPGs, which likely provides the basis for modulating activities of angiopoietins in vivo therefore regulating angiogenesis in physiologic and pathologic situations. Cells and Reagents—Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, A10 embryonic aorta smooth muscle (A10) cells, bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CAPE), C2C12 myoblasts, and COS-7 cells were obtained from the Cell Center Services Facility of University of Pennsylvania. LLC transfectants were maintained in the condition as described previously (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 25Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 563-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Anti-v5 epitope (Invitrogen), anti-Tie2, and anti-Ang-1, -2, and -3, and anti-glypican-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-heparan sulfate (Calbiochem), anti-perlecan (NeoMarkers), and anti-syndecan-1 (BD Biosciences) antibodies, heparinases I and III (Sigma), Streptomyces hyaluronidase (ICN), and Tie-2-Fc (R&D Systems) were used in the experiments. RT-PCR, Mutagenesis, and Expression Constructions—RT-PCR was performed as described previously (25Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 563-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, full-length Ang-1, -2, and -3 cDNAs were amplified using mouse placenta cDNAs as templates together with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a pair of the primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of 24 nucleotides of the coding sequence of each molecule derived from the GenBank™ under the accession numbers U83509, AF004326, and AF113707, respectively. The stop codons were omitted from these reverse primers to fuse Ang-1, -2, and -3 to the C-terminal v5 epitope tag, which is presented in the expression vector (pEF6/V5-His TOPO, Invitrogen). The resulting PCR fragments were inserted into pEF6/V5-His TOPO vectors. Authenticity and correct orientation of Ang-1, -2, and -3 inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. The various deletion fragments of Ang-3 were generated as detailed in the Fig. 4 using the full-length Ang-3 in pEF6/v5-His vector as a template and the ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The accuracy of the deletions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient and Stable Transfection—COS-7 cells and LLC cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with the expression constructs containing cDNA inserts encoding mouse Ang-1, -2, or -3 or the deletional constructs of Ang-3. The transient transfected COS-7 cells were used 72 h after the transfection. The stably transfected LLC cells were selected for blasticidin resistance. The expression level of v5-epitope tagged Ang-1, Ang-2, and full-length and deletion fragments of Ang-3 in COS-7 and LLC transfectants was determined by Western blotting with anti-v5 antibody as described previously (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein Sample Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—To determine the distribution pattern of angiopoietins, Western blotting was performed using the proteins derived from the cell culture supernatants of LLC transfectants or transiently transfected COS-7 cells, lysates of the EDTA-lifted cells, and the ECM materials deposited on the cell culture dishes. The transfected cells were either treated with trypsin for 10 min at room temperature and washed with 10% FBS Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, or released from the culture dishes by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 5 mm EDTA and washed. The trypsin or EDTA-released cells were washed and lysed in 2× SDS Laemmli sample buffer. The ECM materials remaining on the cell culture dishes, after removal of the cells with EDTA solution, were washed and extracted with 2× SDS sample buffer. To determine the binding between the cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) and Ang-3, the EDTA-lifted LLCAng-3 cells were treated with heparinase I (5 units/ml) plus heparinase III (0.5 unit/ml) or Streptomyces hyaluronidase (5 units/ml, as a control for heparinase) at 37 °C for 2 h, washed, lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-v5 antibody to determine whether heparinases have dissociated Ang-3 protein from LLCAng-3 cell surface. To determine whether glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glypicans bind to Ang-3, LLCAng-3 cells were treated with or without 1 unit/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) at 37 °C for 2 h. These LLC Ang-3 cells were washed and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 30 μl (50 μg) of lysed proteins was digested with or without heparinases I and III (1 unit/ml) at 37 °C for 6 h (26Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Kumbasar A. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lander A.D. Korc M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), and the reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 8× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot with anti-glypican-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-v5 antibody. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the protein G bead-bound anti-glypican-1 antibody and the supernatants of the PI-PLC digestion reactions. The immunoprecipitated proteins were digested with or without heparinases as described above and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of glypican-1 and Ang-3 protein. Production and Purification of Angiopoietins—Five liters of cell culture supernatants derived from LLC transfectants expressing mouse or human Ang-1, Ang-2, or Ang-3 protein were collected and purified through Ni+-Probond affinity columns (Invitrogen), and the affinity columns were conjugated with anti-v5 antibodies (Sigma). The purity of the purified proteins was determined by silver staining of SDS-10% PAGE gel loaded with the purified proteins under reducing conditions. The results showed that v5-epitope-tagged Ang-1, Ang-2, and Ang-3 reached more than 90% purity after two rounds of affinity purification, which was demonstrated by the presence of a single silver-stained band with the appropriate molecular weight. The concentration of the purified proteins was determined by Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay using a serial diluted bovine serum albumin (BSA, 2 mg/ml) as a standard. Solid Phase and Cell-based Ligand Binding Assay—96-well ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with heparin, chondroitin sulfate, or hyaluronic acid (HA, 1 mg/ml, Sigma), or BSA (1 mg/ml, Sigma) in triplicate. The coated plates were washed and blocked with 0.5% BSA. Purified Ang-1v5 or Ang-3v5 proteins (500 ng/ml) were applied to the coated plates and incubated for overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with phosphate buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, the 96-well bound Ang-1v5 or Ang-3v5 proteins were detected and measured. The cell-based ligand binding assays were performed by incubating purified Ang-3v5 (1 μg) or Ang-1v5 (1 μg, as a control of Ang-3v5) with the EDTA-lifted 1 × 106 of C2C12, A10, COS-7, and LLC cells; or by incubating purified Tie-2-Fc (2 μg, P&D System) or CD-8-Fc (2 μg, as a control of Tie-2-Fc) with the EDTA-lifted LLCAng-1, LLCAng-2, or LLCAng-3 cells at 4 °C for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer. The cell surface-bound v5-tagged angiopoietins or Tie-2-Fc fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-v5 mAb or anti-human IgG antibody, respectively. Heparin Affinity Column—To determine the binding profile and relative affinity of Ang-3 to heparin, 20 μg of purified Ang-3v5 was applied into a heparin affinity column (heparin-conjugated agarose, Sigma). Ang-3 protein was eluted from the column using non-continuous gradient of NaCl (0.15, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 m). Three fractions (2 ml/each) were collected for each NaCl concentration, and a 20-μl sample from each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-v5 mAb. Endothelial and Tumor Cell Co-culture Assay—Subconfluent LL CAng-3, LLCAng-2, and LLCAng-1 cells were labeled with CellTracker Green CMFDA fluorescein (Molecular Probes) as described previously (27Yu Q. Toole B.P. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1985-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and lifted with the EDTA solution, which was known to preserve Ang-3 protein on the cell surface. These EDTA-lifted cells or soluble angiopoietin (200 ng/ml) were applied to the monolayers of bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CAPE, ATCC) in triplicate for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and observed under microscope and photographed, and the endothelial retraction lesions were counted in ten randomly selected microscopic (40×) fields. Immuocytochemistry—LLC transfectants expressing Ang-1, Ang-2, or Ang-3, or transfected with the empty expression vector were cultured in 35-mm dishes until confluence. Some cells were lifted with the EDTA solution as described (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the cell-free ECM and the confluence LLC transfectants were fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. The fixed cells and ECM were washed and blocked, and antibodies against v5 epitope, Ang-1, Ang-2, Ang-3, and perlecan were used to detected Ang-1, -2, -3, or perlecan. To investigate the relative localization of Ang-3 protein and heparan sulfate (HS) on the LLCAng-3 cell surface, an immunocolocalization experiment was performed using anti-v5 antibody and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody to detect Ang-3v5 protein and anti-heparan sulfate (Calbiochem) antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to detect HS, respectively. To determine the relative localization of Ang-3 and perlecan, glypican, or syndecan and determine whether HS side chains on proteoglycans are required for the binding of Ang-3 to cell surface, LLCAng-3 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 mm sodium chlorate and fixed. Immunocolocalization experiments were performed using anti-v5 antibody with TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody to detect Ang-3v5, and anti-perlecan (NeoMarkers) or anti-glypican-1 antibody with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody to detect perlecan or glypican-1, respectively, or using FITC-conjugated anti-v5 antibody to detect Ang-3v5 protein and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-syndecan-1 (BD Biosciences) antibody to detect syndecan-1. The inhibitory effect of sodium chlorate on the synthesis of HS in LLCAng-3 cells was revealed by anti-HS antibody (Calbiochem). To determine whether the cell surface-bound Ang-3 binds to Tie-2-Fc fusion protein, the methanol-fixed LLCAng-3 cells were washed, blocked, and incubated with Tie-2-Fc. The cell surface-bound Tie-2-Fc fusion protein was revealed by TRITC-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody, and Ang-3v5 protein in the same cells was detected with anti-v5 mAb with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Unlike Ang-1 and Ang-2, Ang-3 Is Retained on the Surface of Various Cells—It was noted previously that, unlike producing Ang-2, it is difficult to produce and purify Ang-1 and Ang-3 proteins (13Maisonpierre P.C.

We have demonstrated recently that, unlike Ang-2, which is primarily secreted, Ang-1 is secreted and incorporated into the ECM and the binding of Ang-1 to the ECM regulates availability and activity of Ang-1 (20Xu Y. Yu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34990-34998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ang-3 binds to the ECM as well, we investigated the distribution pattern of Ang-3 protein in the established LLC transfectants expressing the C-terminal v5 epitope-tagged Ang-3 (Ang-3v5). The v5 epitope is a 14-amino acid epitope derived from P and V proteins of the paramyxovirus, SV5 (28Southern J.A. Young D.F. Heaney F. Gaumgartner W. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The proteins used in the Western blotting were derived from culture supernatants, from the ECM materials deposited on the cell culture dishes, and from the EDTA-lifted LLC transfectants expressing v5-tagged Ang-1 (LLCAng-1), Ang-2 (LLCAng-2), or Ang-3 (LLCAng-3). The results showed that Ang-2 is largely secreted, Ang-1 is incorporated into the ECM, and a large fraction of Ang-3 is associated with the transfected cells (Fig. 1). The similar result was obtained in several other cell lines tested, including COS-7, 293, and TA3 mammary carcinoma cells (data not shown). Like all the proteins containing the coiled-coil domain, angiopoietins are aggregated to form dimers and oligomers through their coiled-coil region, and treatment of the proteins with β-mercaptoethanol releases these aggregates to monomers (Refs. 12Davis S.

The ECM-bound Ang-1 is aggregated to form oligomers, whereas the cell-associated Ang-3 exists in monomeric, dimeric, and some oligomeric forms (Figs. 1C and 2).Fig. 2Ang-3 binds to the surface of various cells.A, the binding of Ang-3v5 to LLC cells is sensitive to the trypsin treatment (10 min in room temperature with 500 μg/ml trypsin). Two independent clonal LLCAng-3 transfectants were treated and lifted with trypsin (lanes 3 and 4) or EDTA solution (lanes 1 and 2), and these cells were washed and lysed with 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-v5 mAb.

https://openalex.org/W2004323314,"The fundamental mechanisms of mitosis are conserved throughout evolution in eukaryotes, including ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of cell cycle regulators by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. The spindle checkpoint protein Cdc20 activates the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in a substrate-specific manner. It is present in the cytoplasm and concentrated in the centrosomes throughout the cell cycle, accumulates at the kinetochores in metaphase, and is no longer detected following anaphase. However, it is unknown whether Cdc20 has the same activities and distribution during meiosis in male germ cells. We found that in mice, Cdc20 accumulates in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes during meiosis I, is distributed throughout spermatocytes undergoing meiotic division, and is present in the cytoplasm of postmeiotic spermatids. Several proteins bind to and regulate the function of Cdc20 during mitosis. We identified speriolin and determined that it is a novel spermatogenic cell-specific Cdc20-binding protein, is present in the cytoplasm, and is concentrated at the centrosomes of spermatocytes and spermatids and that a leucine zipper domain is required to target speriolin to the centrosome. The seven tandem WD motifs of Cdc20 probably fold into a seven-blade β-propeller structure, and we determined that they are required for speriolin binding and for localization of Cdc20 to the centrosomes and nucleus, suggesting that speriolin might regulate or stabilize the folding of Cdc20 during meiosis in spermatogenic cells.

The mitotic phase of the cell cycle progresses by the periodic activation and inactivation of regulatory proteins by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The multiprotein anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; EYFP, enhanced yellow-green fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LZ, leucine zipper; mLZ, mutant LZ; 100P, 100,000 × g insoluble particulate fraction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBSE, PBS containing 1 mm EDTA; 100S, 100,000 × g soluble cytosolic fraction; contig, group of overlapping clones; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is the core regulatory component in this pathway (3Page A.M. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 583-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and a substrate-specific recruiting subunit, either Cdc20 or Cdh1, is essential for APC activation. Cdc20 is activated early in mitosis and signals the ubiquitin-mediated destruction of cyclin A, securin, and other proteins and is then degraded, whereas Cdh1 is activated during anaphase and telophase to trigger the destruction of additional substrates (2Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). The location of Cdc20 in somatic cells changes during the cell cycle. In interphase, it is concentrated in the centrosomes and distributed diffusely at low levels throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. During mitosis, Cdc20 accumulates in the nucleus in prophase, is concentrated at the kinetochores in metaphase until all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, and is no longer detected after late anaphase (4Weinstein J.

Mad2 competes with APC binding to the N-terminal region of Cdc20 until all kinetochores achieve bipolar attachment to the mitotic spindle, whereas Emi1 prevents Cdc20 interaction with substrates without inhibiting binding to the APC (10Fang G.

When the N-terminal or C-terminal β-strand is deleted, the protein assumes a relaxed open form (17Baker S.C. Saunders N.F. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Fülöp V. J. Mol.

Whereas all seven of the WD motifs are required for localization of Cdc20 to the kinetochores and to the spindle apparatus (6Kallio M.J. Beardmore V.A. Weinstein J. Gorbsky G.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), it is unclear how these processes occur. Furthermore, it remains to be determined how the structure of Cdc20 relates to its ability to selectively bind substrates or to its subcellular localization, including concentration at the kinetochores. A meiotic spindle checkpoint apparently functions in mammals during spermatogenesis (19Eaker S Pyle A. Cobb J. Handel M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2953-2965PubMed Google Scholar, 20Eaker S Cobb J.

Disrupting the gene for F box protein β-TrCP1, a ubiquitously expressed substrate-binding subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligase (23Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol.

These defects were caused in part by the accumulation of Emi1 (25Margottin-Goguet F. Hsu J.Y. Loktev A. Hsieh H.M. Reimann J.D. Jackson P.K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 813-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The meiotic checkpoint appears to be more stringent during spermatogenesis than oogenesis, because 10-25% of all human fetuses have an abnormal number of chromosomes due mainly (80-90%) to nondisjunction of chromosomes at maternal metaphase I (26Hassold T. Hunt P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). These studies focused on the role of the last β-strand on the C-terminal WD motif (WD7-β4) in the subcellular localization of Cdc20 during spermatogenesis. They resulted in the identification of speriolin, a spermatogenic cell-specific protein that binds to the WD7-β4 domain of Cdc20, suggesting that it regulates Cdc20 during meiosis in male germ cells. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed on ∼3 million clones of a mouse testis cDNA library (Clontech) using pAS2WD7 as bait, as described previously (27Miki K. Eddy E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34384-34390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Screening, elimination of false positives, and plasmid isolation from triple positive (β-galactosidase and His3 gene expression plus 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole resistance) clones were performed as recommended by the supplier. Northern Blotting—A mouse Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN™) Blot (Clontech), containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane was probed with a radiolabeled cDNA fragment. The membrane was analyzed by autoradiography at -80 °C using Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film with an intensifying screen. The blot was exposed for 12-36 h. Blots were reused after being stripped by boiling in 0.2% SDS. Construction of cDNA Plasmids—The cDNA fragments for fusion protein expression were prepared by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) or LA-Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and cloned into the appropriate vectors and then verified by sequencing. For yeast two-hybrid screening, a cDNA encoding the Cdc20 N-terminal segment (amino acids 1-185) and C-terminal segment of the seven WD motif region (amino acids 442-499) was cloned into the pAS2-1 (Clontech) vector, resulting in pAS2WD7. The cDNA for wild-type or mutant Cdc20 was subcloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) or pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) vector to add in-frame N-terminal tags. To obtain the full-length Sprn cDNA, the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reaction was performed using mouse testis Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) as template. The amplified fragment was cloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector and sequenced. Wild-type and mutant speriolin constructs were subcloned into pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) or pET-28a(+) (Novagen) vector to add in-frame N-terminal tags. PCR-based random mutagenesis was performed in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dATP, 1 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm dCTP, and 0.2 mm dGTP using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). To produce mutations in pAS2WD7, the region encoding amino acids 442-499 of Cdc20 was replaced by randomly mutagenized cDNA fragments encoding the same region and verified by sequencing. 10 of 4,000 colonies were chosen randomly for sequencing to estimate the frequency of random mutagenesis. 8 of 10 had one or two mutations, and two were wild-type. Plasmids were extracted from four thousand transformants and pooled to produce a randomly mutagenized minilibrary (pAS2WD7mut). For speriolin (amino acids 227-480), cDNA fragments randomly mutagenized by PCR were subcloned into the pGAD10 (Clontech) vector and verified by sequencing. Antibodies—The antibodies to speriolin were raised in rabbits against a purified His-tagged region of speriolin (amino acids 227-480), or a synthetic peptide (CRKTPHRKSNKLPDNPRDTK) corresponding to residues 309-327, conjugated via its amino-terminal cysteine was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Speriolin (residues 227-480) with a His6 tag was expressed in BL21 cells, purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography, and further purified by extraction from a single SDS-PAGE band. The antibodies were affinity-purified by passing crude antiserum over a SulfoLink column (Pierce), to which the antigen had been coupled. Antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8) into tubes containing 1 m Tris-base. The pH of the pooled fractions was adjusted to neutral, and 0.1% NaN3 was added, and the purified antisera were stored at 4 °C. The specificity of the antibodies for speriolin was determined by Western blotting using COS-7 cell lysates containing EYFP-speriolin. Monoclonal antibody (JL-8) specific for green fluorescent protein (GFP) and enhanced yellow-green fluorescent protein (EYFP) (anti-GFP) was from Clontech. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG (M2), α-tubulin (B5-1-2), γ-tubulin (GTU-88), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG, and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Antibodies to HSP70/HSC70 (BB70) and calreticulin (SPA-600) were from Stressgen. Monoclonal antibodies to p55CDC/Cdc20 (H-7) and Cdc27 (C4), rabbit polyclonal antibody to lamin B (M-20), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody to pericentrin (clone 30) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Preparation of Mouse Tissue Extracts and Western Blotting—Various adult tissue samples from CD-1 mice were placed on ice in TN4D buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Tissues were homogenized on ice, and then soluble and insoluble proteins were fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit II, and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. Whole cell extracts of fractionated germ cells or sperm were prepared by boiling cells in SDS sample buffer for 10 min. Equal loads of proteins from tissue lysates (30 μg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then electroblotted onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Animal care and use were in accordance with United States Public Health Service guidelines, and procedures used in these studies involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—COS-7 or BALB/3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. For transfection, plasmids were prepared with the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Transient transfections were carried out with TransIt-LT1 (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For fluorescence microscopic observation, transfected cells were maintained in 2- or 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tech) for 24 h at 37 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then immunofluorescence staining was performed. For visualization of nuclei, cells were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Immunoprecipitation and Pull-down Assay—For immunoprecipitation, cells transfected with FLAG- and EYFP-tagged proteins were lysed in TN4D buffer by sonication and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 19 mm NaF, 37 μm Na3VO4, 0.037% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets; Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform. Immunoprecipitates were washed with PBS, boiled in SDS-sample buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.07% bromphenol blue), subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and then electrotransferred onto an Immobilon membrane. For pull-down assay, GST-speriolin (residues 227-480) bound to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) was used as bait. GST bound to glutathione-agarose was used as negative control. Adult CD-1 mouse testis was homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The soluble fraction was diluted to 10 times the original volume in PBS containing protease inhibitors, mixed with bait, and then rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the pellet three times with PBS, proteins were eluted using SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Membrane was then stained by Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). Immunostaining of Testis Sections—Immunohistochemical localization was carried out on 6-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissue samples using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector). The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, diluted with automation buffer (Biomeda Corp.) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BA-buffer), in a humidified chamber. Monoclonal antibody to Cdc20 (H-7) was diluted 1:100, and antiserum to speriolin was diluted 1:2000 with BA-buffer. Slides were stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector). Immunofluorescence Staining of Isolated Germ Cells—Mixed germ cells were isolated from testes of adult CD-1 mice, with minor modifications of established procedures (28O'Brien D.A. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 3A: 246-264Google Scholar). Seminiferous tubules were dissociated in enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium containing collagenase (0.5 mg/ml) and trypsin (0.25 mg/ml). Following filtration through 80-μm nylon mesh and centrifugation, cells were suspended in enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate to a final concentration of ∼106/ml and transferred onto a SuperFrost plus microscope slide (Fisher). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4 °C, and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in BA-buffer. Cells were labeled for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies followed by fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated or Alexa-Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibodies in a humidified chamber. Nuclei were labeled with DAPI, and slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector). Protein localization was determined at a magnification of 400× using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope and a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Final images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop Version 6. Fractionation of Cell Lysates and Trypsin Protection Assay—Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were lysed and homogenized using a Potter-type homogenizer in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)) and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the soluble cytosolic fraction (100S) from the insoluble particulate fraction (100P). The 100P pellet was suspended in TN4D containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5 m NaCl or in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA (PBSE) for Western blotting or trypsin protection assays, respectively. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Four microliters of the 100P pellet obtained from lysates of COS-7 cells expressing EYFP-speriolin were resuspended in PBSE and mixed with 1 μl of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) or PBSE and incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by Western blotting. Presence of Cdc20 in Spermatogenic Cells—Northern and Western blotting of gels loaded with equal amounts of materials determined that Cdc20 mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B) are abundant in the adult mouse testis and that Cdc20 protein is detected in the 0.1% Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction of the tissue examined only in testis. The first wave of spermatogenesis in postnatal mice is relatively synchronous. The insoluble form slightly increased in amount on postnatal day 18, corresponding to the first wave of meiotic divisions, and again on postnatal day 24, when condensing spermatids are first observed (Fig. 1C). Although this suggested that Cdc20 is present in spermatids, it was undetectable in sperm isolated from the cauda epididymis (data not shown). The presence of Cdc20 in spermatogenic cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry on sections of adult mouse testis. The protein was present at low levels in spermatogonia, detected at higher levels throughout the cytoplasm of midpachytene spermatocytes, and localized at the periphery of the nucleus of late pachytene spermatocytes. The Cdc20 protein was seen throughout the cytoplasm of spermatids during most of the postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis but not in early elongating spermatids (Fig. 2). The presence of Cdc20 in spermatids was unanticipated, because in somatic cells it peaks in abundance at the G2/M phase and disappears in late mitosis (29Harper J.W. Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2179-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Immunohistochemical localization of Cdc20 in sections of adult mouse testis. Sections of adult mouse testis were immunostained with monoclonal antibody to Cdc20. Cdc20 was most abundant in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes (P). Immunostaining was also detected in spermatocytes undergoing meiotic division (M) and in round (RS) and condensing (CS) spermatids while undetectable in early elongating spermatids (ES). Stages of spermatogenesis are indicated in Roman numerals. Bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Molecular Cloning of Speriolin—Because Cdc20-binding proteins regulate its function during mitosis, we hypothesized that novel proteins might be involved in regulating Cdc20 function during meiosis in spermatogenic cells. To identify a Cdc20-binding protein, a mouse testis library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid method. Screening with the full-length Cdc20 protein resulted in a large number of false positives. Therefore, a bait vector (pAS2WD7) was constructed with a cDNA encoding the N-terminal 185 amino acids (containing WD1-β1) and the C-terminal 57 amino acids (containing WD7-β2, -β3, and -β4) of Cdc20 that was expected to express a WD motif with four β strands as a GAL4-BP fusion protein (Cdc20-WD). Empty vector was used as a control. This led to the isolation of three clones, and sequencing determined that their cDNA inserts varied in length but encoded the same protein. A full-length cDNA was assembled from the overlapping sequences of the original clones (nucleotides 109-1607), and a fragment was generated using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure (nucleotides 1-630). An open reading frame between nucleotides 72 and 1514 encoded a novel protein containing 480 amino acids with a leucine zipper (LZ) motif at the N terminus (amino acids 3-37), a calculated molecular mass of 51,400 daltons, and a predicted pI of 8.16. We named the protein speriolin (SPRN). We confirmed physical interaction between speriolin and Cdc20 by pull-down assays using testis lysates (Fig. 3). We also found that speriolin co-precipitated Cdc27 (Fig. 3), a component of APC, together with Cdc20, suggesting that speriolin binds to APCCdc20 in testis. Data base searching determined that an uncharacterized sequence in GenBank™ is identical to nucleotides 14-1592 of the Sprn cDNA (accession number AK006994; RIKEN clone 1700084J23, Mus musculus adult male testis). It also was determined that the Sprn gene is located within the WGS supercontig Mm15_WIFeb01_286 (genomic contig: NW_000106) and spans a region of ∼23.8 kb located on mouse chromosome 15D3 that is syntenic with human chromosome 8q24. The gene contains five exons, and the proposed exon-intron boundaries follow the canonical GT/AG rule (data not shown). The Sprn cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AB032199). A scan of the NCBI mouse genome data base using BLAST did not detect any Sprn pseudogenes. Speriolin Expression and Localization—Northern analysis determined that among the mouse tissues examined, the Sprn message is specific to the testis (Fig. 4A). Speriolin protein also was detected only in testis homogenates by Western blotting using either affinity-purified rabbit antisera to His6-tagged fusion protein (amino acids 227-480) (Fig. 4B) or to a synthetic peptide (amino acids 309-327) (data not shown). The preimmune serum (data not shown) and the antisera preabsorbed with His-tagged speriolin were negative on testis (Fig. 4B), providing evidence that the antisera are specific to endogenous speriolin. Whereas Cdc20 was found primarily in the 0.1% Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction and in limited amounts in the insoluble fraction of testis homogenates by Western blotting, speriolin was detected only in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 4C). Western blotting of developmental stages of testis further indicated that expression of speriolin begins between days 14 and 16, when pachytene spermatocytes develop, increases by day 22, when postmeiotic spermatids are seen, and is abundant in epididymal sperm but is not detected in adult ovary (Fig. 4D). These observations were consistent with the immunohistochemical analysis. Speriolin is first seen in late pachytene spermatocytes, is abundant throughout spermatocytes undergoing meiotic division, and is present in the cytoplasm of spermatids (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Immunohistochemical localization of speriolin in testis. Histological sections of Bouin's fixed and paraffin-embedded adult mouse testis were incubated with affinity-purified antibody to speriolin. Speriolin was detected in spermatocytes undergoing meiotic division (M). Staining was detected in pachytene spermatocytes (P) and round spermatids (RS) and was abundant in the cytoplasm of condensing spermatids (CS). Bar, 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunofluorescence assays on mixed spermatogenic cells isolated from adult mouse testis were used to determine the subcellular distribution of speriolin (Fig. 6). The cytoplasm was weakly stained, but one or two spots in the cytoplasm were more intensely stained in pachytene spermatocytes, spermatocytes undergoing meiotic division, round spermatids, and condensed spermatids, suggesting that speriolin accumulates in the centrosome. This was confirmed by immunostaining of isolated germ cells simultaneously with antibodies to speriolin and to the centrosomal protein pericentrin and determining that the two proteins are co-localized in spermatocytes (Fig. 6). We also confirmed that pericentrin is undetectable in spermatids (30Manandhar G. Sutovsky P. Joshi H.C. Stearns T. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but found that speriolin was localized to the centrosomes in these cells. These results strongly suggest that speriolin is a spermatogenic cell-specific centrosomal protein. The Leucine Zipper Motif Is Required for Localization of Speriolin to the Centrosome—A series of EYFP-speriolin deletion mutants were generated to identify the domain responsible for centrosomal targeting.

This study reports the first purification of NrfB, a novel 20-kDa pentaheme c-type cytochrome encoded by the nrfB gene that follows the nrfA gene in many bacterial nrf operons. Analyses by gel filtration demonstrated that NrfB purifies as a decaheme homodimer. Analysis of NrfB by UV-visible and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrates that all five NrfB ferric heme irons are low spin and are most likely coordinated by two axial histidine ligands. Spectropotentiometry revealed that the midpoint redox potentials of five ferric hemes were in the low potential range of 0 to –400 mV.

The reduction of nitrate to ammonium in the periplasm of Escherichia coli involves two enzymes, periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapA) and periplasmic cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA). The process is found in many enteric bacteria and may be important for anaerobic nitrate and nitrite respiration at low nitrate concentrations (1Potter L.C. Millington P. Griffiths L. Thomas G.H.

The NrfA protein catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonium but can also catalyze the five-electron reduction of NO and two-electron reduction of hydroxylamine, both of which may be bound intermediates in the catalytic cycle for nitrite reduction (3Berks B.C.

In one group, which includes W. succinogenes and S. deleyianum, nrfA clusters with an adjacent gene, nrfH, that encodes a membrane-anchored tetraheme quinol dehydrogenase of the NapC family (10Potter L.

In the second group, which includes E. coli, nrfA clusters with genes encoding a putative periplasmic pentaheme cytochrome (nrfB), a periplasmic (4 × [4Fe4S]) ferredoxin (nrfC) and an integral membrane putative quinol dehydrogenase (nrfD) (3Berks B.C.

The different protein-protein and cofactor-cofactor interactions implicit in this situation may be reflected by insertions and deletions in loop regions of the polypeptide chain in the two subgroups that can be identified in primary and tertiary structure analyses (9Bamford V.A.

Despite the importance of periplasmic nitrite reduction to ammonium in enteric bacteria and the developing structure-informed biochemical understanding of the enzyme that catalyzes this process, the nature of electron delivery has never been addressed biochemically. In this paper we present the first purification and spectropotentiometric characterization of NrfB and demonstrate its competence as an electron donor to NrfA, with which it must transiently form a 20-heme [NrfB]2[NrfA]2 electron transfer complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth of Bacteria—The E. coli K-12 strain LCB2048 is defective in the nitrate reductases NarA and NarZ and, because of a narL mutation, expresses the formate-dependent nitrite reductase NrfA at elevated levels during anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate (14Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures of strain LCB2048 were grown without aeration overnight at 37 °C in minimal salts medium (14Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glycerol, 20 mm nitrate, kanamycin (25 μg/ml), and spectinomycin (25 μg/ml). Initial cultures (250 ml) were inoculated with 0.5 ml of an overnight culture grown aerobically on Luria-Bertani broth medium. The 250-ml culture was successively transferred to 2, 6, and 100 liters of fresh medium.Purification of Native E. coli NrfB and NrfA—Periplasmic proteins were extracted from the harvested cells as described previously (14Potter L.C. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 69-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was precipitated from the periplasm using 65% saturated ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. The precipitate was dialyzed and applied to an anion exchange Q-Sepharose column (35 × 3 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. The column was developed using a linear gradient of 0–200 mm NaCl. NrfB eluted at ∼100 mm and NrfA eluted at ∼80 mm NaCl. The NrfB and NrfA fractions were applied separately to a Superdex G-75 HiLoad 16/60 fast protein liquid chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7. NrfB and NrfA were then further purified on an anion exchange Dionex column (0.9 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, using a SPRINT system. The column was developed using a 0–100 mm NaCl linear gradient, and NrfA eluted at 60 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method using bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. The NrfA and NrfB were judged pure on the basis of Coomassie Blue and heme-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1).Expression of Recombinant nrfB—The nrfB gene encoding NrfB was amplified from E. coli strain JM109 genomic DNA by PCR using gene-specific primers (5′-ATGAGAGTATTACGTTCGTT-3′ and 5′-TCATGGCTGCTCCTTAAGCA-3′) and the proofreading polymerase pwo. The resulting DNA fragment was purified using a commercial gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and inserted by blunt end ligation into the EcoRV site of the plasmid pETBlue-1 (Novagen) to place the recombinant nrfB under the control of the IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; LMCT, ligand-metal charge transfer; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; NIR, near-infrared; STC small tetraheme cytochrome.-inducible T7 promoter. Recombinant plasmids were identified by blue-white screening, and the orientation of nrfB inserts was determined by restriction digests. Suitable recombinant plasmids were transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21(DE3)(pEC86). The accessory plasmid pEC86 provided constitutive expression of the cytochrome c maturation (ccm) gene cluster, thus allowing expression of recombinant c-type cytochromes under aerobic conditions. E. coli BL21(DE3)(pEC86)(pNrfB) was grown on Luria-Bertani medium plus ampicillin (100 μgml–1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml–1) at 37 °C with aeration to the mid-exponential phase prior to induction with 1 mm IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 16 h after induction.Purification of Recombinant E. coli NrfB—Whole cell extracts of induced BL21(DE3)(pEC86)(pNrfB) were generated by sonication of the harvested and washed cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. NrfB, as indicated by a red coloration, was precipitated by 10–20% ammonium sulfate and then resuspended in and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. This dialyzed sample was then further separated on a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer by using a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl over 5 column volumes. NrfB was found to elute at 300 mm NaCl.Activity Assays—Nitrite reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by substrate-dependent oxidation of reduced methyl viologen (ϵ600 nm = 13,700 m–1 cm–1). Assays (3.5-ml final volume) were performed by mixing at 25 °C in anaerobic cuvettes containing 1 mm methyl viologen, 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7, and either nitrite or hydroxylamine. Methyl viologen was reduced by the addition of sodium dithionite, and turnover was initiated by the addition of NrfA (0.14 μg/ml).MCD and EPR Spectroscopy—Perpendicular and parallel mode EPR measurements were performed with a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an Oxford ESR-9 liquid helium cryostat and a dual mode cavity with microwave frequencies of 9.65 and 9.35 GHz for the perpendicular and parallel modes, respectively. MCD experiments were recorded on either a circular dichrograph, JASCO J-810, for the wavelength range 280–1000 nm and a JASCO J-730 for the range 800–2000 nm. Samples were exchanged into deuterated buffer and placed in quartz cuvettes within an Oxford Instruments SM1 6T superconducting solenoid with an ambient temperature bore for room temperature measurements.Visible Absorption Spectra and Mediated Redox Potentiometry—Absorption spectra were collected using an Amicon SLM DW2000 spectrophotometer. The UV-visible spectra and redox titration of soluble NrfB was carried out at 25 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 100 mm NaCl. Mediated redox potentiometry was performed as described previously (9Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 41: 2921-2931Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Dithionite and ferricyanide were used as reductant and oxidant, respectively. Redox mediators were phenazine methosulfate, phenazine ethosulfate, diaminodurene, 4-hydroxynapthoquinone, 5-anthraquinone 2-sulfonate, 6-anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate, and benzylviologen (at a final concentration of 20 μm). A saturated quinhydrone solution (EpH7 = +295 mV) was used to calibrate the electrode. All potentials quoted are with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode. Redox titrations were fitted with a variable number of n = 1 Nernstian components using a customized program that allowed the midpoint redox potential, the number of redox components, and the contribution of each component to float as appropriate.Analytical Methods—Native PAGE was performed using commercially prepared 12% gels (Gradipore Ltd.) to separate purified samples of NrfA and NrfB under non-denaturing conditions. After running, the gels were soaked in standard SDS-containing running buffer, and the proteins were visualized by staining for covalently bound heme using the peroxidase assay. Analytical gel filtration was carried out on both S-75 and S-200 gel filtration columns (Amersham-Pharmacia) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 200 mm NaCl. Samples were loaded in the same buffer from a 100-μl injection loop, and the columns were run at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. Elution profiles were recorded by monitoring the A280 nm of the eluate.Reconstitution of NrfB with NrfA—Purified NrfB (0.4 μm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl was reduced by the addition of an equimolar amount of sodium dithionite in a sealed, anaerobic, 1-ml cuvette. A catalytic amount of NrfA (5 nm) and 1 mm nitrite were added by injection from anaerobic stock solutions. The transition of NrfB from a reduced to oxidized state was monitored by recording changes in the absorbance at 552 nm over time.RESULTSPurification and Quaternary Structure of NrfB—Purified NrfB migrated as a single, ∼20-kDa band on Coomassie-stained and heme-stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig 1, A and B). By comparison with 52-kDa NrfA, the 20-kDa NrfB stained poorly with Coomassie Blue. However, NrfB and NrfA stained comparably for heme (Fig 1B), which reflects the presence of five hemes per polypeptide in both proteins. The purification procedure for NrfB yielded ∼0.5 mg of protein at this level of purity from a 100-liter culture. Analysis of the NrfB pro-protein using the SignalP program suggests that the signal peptide is cleaved at position Ala34-Ser35. This would give a molecular mass of 17,549, which increases to 20,579 when five covalently attached apo-heme groups are added, a figure consistent with the SDS-PAGE analysis. Analysis by gel exclusion chromatography yielded a molecular weight of 33 kDa (Fig. 1C). This indicates that native NrfB is a decaheme homodimer in solution.UV-Visible Properties of NrfB—The oxidized and reduced UV-visible spectrum of NrfB (Fig. 2A) are typical of c-type cytochromes. The oxidized spectrum has maxima at 409 and 532 nm, which are characteristic of low spin ferric hemes. No features between 600–650 nm, characteristic of a ligand-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band of a high spin heme, were observed in freshly prepared samples. It was noted that such a signal did develop on prolonged storage (over a period of weeks) at 4 °C, which presumably reflected the lability of an axial heme ligand on one or more of the hemes, and such samples were not used for further spectroscopic or potentiometric analyses. The dithionite-reduced NrfB spectrum exhibits the Soret, β, and α bands at 420.5, 523.5 and 552 nm, which are characteristic of low spin ferrous c-type hemes (Fig 2A).Fig. 2Spectroscopic properties of NrfB in the UV-visible region and the re-oxidation of ferrous NrfB by NrfA and nitrite.A, UV-visible absorption spectra of oxidized (····) and sodium dithionite reduced (——) NrfB. NrfB concentration was 3 μm in 0.05 m Hepes, pH 7. B, NrfA- and nitrite-dependent re-oxidation NrfB. NrfB (0.5 μm) was pre-reduced using sodium dithionite. Absorbance was measured at 552 nm, and NrfA (5 nm) and nitrite (1 mm) was added as indicated. Spectra were recorded at the start and end of the experiments to confirm that the NrfA was fully reduced at the start and fully oxidized at the end. Black line, no added NaCl; gray line, plus 500 mm NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Reconstitution of NrfB with NrfA—In equimolar mixtures, NrfA and NrfB did not co-elute when passed down gel exclusion columns under a range of conditions and also did not co-migrate upon subjection to native PAGE, showing that they do not form a tight complex. However, upon the addition of nitrite (1 mm) to dithionite-reduced NrfB (0.5 μm) in the presence of catalytic amounts of NrfA (5 nm), a rapid oxidation of NrfB was observed as evidenced by a decrease in absorbance of the reduced NrfB α peak at 552 nm (Fig. 2B). The initial rate of oxidation of NrfB under the experimental reaction conditions was 100 electrons s–1. Spectra collected at the end of the experiment confirmed that full re-oxidation of NrfB had occurred. This finding indicates that, in the presence of the nitrite reductase NrfA, electrons can flow from NrfB via NrfA to nitrite. The full oxidation of NrfB via the 100-fold sub-stoichiometric NrfA shows that the oxidized NrfA dimer must interact transiently with a number of molecules of the reduced NrfB dimer during the time course of the experiment. In control experiments, oxidation of ferrous NrfB was not observed when nitrite was added to NrfB in the absence of NrfA, but NrfB oxidation was observed when NrfA was subsequently added (not shown). Not surprisingly for oxidation of a decaheme complex, the oxidation kinetics of NrfB were polyphasic, and, although not analyzed in detail, ionic strength appeared to have only marginal effect within the range 0–0.5 m NaCl. This observation suggested that the dominant forces stabilizing the interaction are not electrostatic in nature.Spectropotentiometric Properties of NrfB—Spectra of NrfB were collected at a number of potentials in the range of 400 mV to –400 mV. Plots of the increase in the absorbance change (measured at 552–700 nm) as a function of potential can be most simply fitted to five independently titrating (n = 1) low spin Nernstian components, each of which contribute approximately equally to the total reduced absorption peak (Fig 3A). The best fit to the data gave midpoint potentials at –63, –221, and –259 mV for three hemes and at –129 mV for two hemes with iso-midpoint potentials. Inspection of the spectra collected at each potential did not reveal any changes in the position of the λmax (Fig 3B; note that at low potential, spectral features in the region of 600–650 nm become obscured by the absorption of reduced methyl viologen, which is present as a redox mediator)Fig. 3Spectropotentiometric titration of NrfB.A, the absorbance difference at 552–700 nm versus potential. B, absorbance spectra of NrfB collected at the different potentials.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Magnetic Circular Dichroism of NrfB—The UV-visible MCD spectrum of NrfB exhibited an intense, derivative-shaped band centered at ∼400 nm in the Soret region (Fig 4A). When normalized for the presence of five hemes, this derivative had a peak to trough intensity of ∼150 m–1 cm–1 tesla–1 heme–1. This value is consistent with that observed for other low spin heme proteins (15Blackmore R.S. Brittain T. Gadsby P.M. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Blackmore R.S. Gadsby P.M. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the intensity of the MCD Soret band derivative is consistent with the presence of five low spin hemes in NrfB. This result is also supported by the α,β-MCD bands at 500–600 nm, which are typical of low spin heme. No signals characteristic of high spin species in the region of 600–650 nm were apparent. The charge transfer band for low spin ferric heme occurs in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the electronic absorption spectrum in the region of 800–2500 nm. This LMCT band is rarely detected by absorption spectroscopy but can be readily detected by MCD spectroscopy, with the peak wavelength being an excellent indicator of the axial ligands to the heme iron (15Blackmore R.S. Brittain T. Gadsby P.M. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 244-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Thomson A.J. Cheesman M.R. George S. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In NrfB, a broad positive LMCT band was observed at 1500 nm with a vibrational side band at lower wavelength (1200–1300 nm). This observation is characteristic of low spin bis-His coordinated ferric heme (Fig 4B). The 1500-nm band displays a broadening on its low energy side (∼1520 nm), which reflects the fact that five hemes in different protein environments contribute to this signal. At the λmax of the LMCT NIR MCD bands, low spin bis-His hemes characteristically have a Δϵ of between 0.8 and 1.2 m–1 cm–1 tesla–1. The intensity of the NrfB LMCT band when normalized for five hemes is 1.05 m–1 cm–1 tesla–1 and is thus again consistent with the presence of five low spin hemes.Fig. 4Room temperature MCD spectrum of oxidized NrfB.A, visible region. NrfB concentration was 1.3 μm in 0.05 m Hepes, pH* 7. B, near infrared region. NrfB concentration was 130 μm in 0.05 m Hepes, pH* 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)EPR Spectroscopy of NrfB—The low temperature frozen solution perpendicular mode X-band EPR spectrum of air-oxidized NrfA collected at a temperature of 10 K and with microwave power of 2 milliwatts is complex (Fig 5A). The EPR signals at g ≈ 2.99, 2.27, and 1.5 are typical for the gz, gy, and gx components of rhombic Fe(III) signals arising from low spin bis-His-ligated Fe(III) hemes in which the planes of the imidazole rings are near-parallel (23Walker F.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 186: 471-534Crossref Google Scholar). Quantification of this signal by integration against a 1 mm copper EDTA standard gave a nearest integer value of 2 spin NrfB–1. The second heme signal is a weak “large gmax” signal at gz ≈ 3.57 (23Walker F.A. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1999; 186: 471-534Crossref Google Scholar). Such signals have low intensities with broad line widths and are therefore difficult to detect and quantify (24DeVries S.E. Albract S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the feature becomes better resolved at higher microwave powers (Fig. 5B). Spin quantification yielded a value of 3 spin NrfB–1. The large gmax signal is likely to arise from NrfB hemes in which the planes of the two imidazole rings of the His ligands are near-perpendicular. There was no strong signal at g = 6, characteristic of magnetically isolated high spin heme, which was consistent with the absence of high spin heme features in the UV-visible and MCD spectra. No broad features at g ∼ 12 or g ∼ 3.5, characteristic of spin-coupled hemes (S = 1/2 and S = 5/2) that have been observed in NrfA (9Bamford V.A. Angove H.C. Seward H.E. Thomson A.J. Cole J.A. Butt J.N. Hemmings A.M. Richardson D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 41: 2921-2931Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were observed in either the parallel or the perpendicular mode spectra of NrfB. The contribution of two hemes to the rhombic signal and three hemes to the large gmax signal demonstrates that all five NrfB hemes are detectable and that none are rendered EPR silent through magnetic interactions with each other.Fig. 5Perpendicular mode X-band EPR spectra of air-oxidized native and recombinant NrfB. Spectra were collected at a temperature of 10 K and microwave power of 2 milliwatts (A and C) and a temperature of 10 K and microwave power of 40 milliwatts (B and D). For both spectra, the modulation amplitude was 1 millitesla (mT), the microwave frequency was 9.67 GHz, and the NrfB concentration was 40 μm in 0.05 m Hepes, pH 7. A and B, native NrfB. C and D, recombinant NrfB. The features at g = 3.57, 2.99, 2.27, and 1.5 are discussed under “Results.” The feature at g = 4.3 arises from adventitious iron. The gap in the data at ∼325–350 milliteslas is due to removal of a cavity signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Expression of Recombinant nrfB—In NrfA, heme 1 is attached to a CXXCK motif, and the NrfEFG assembly proteins encoded within the nrf operon are required for heme attachment to this unusual motif in which the Lys provides the proximal heme iron ligand (10Potter L. Angove H. Richardson D. Cole J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 45: 51-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). NrfB heme 1 is attached to a CXXCHK motif, but it is most likely, although not certain, that the His rather than the Lys is the proximal heme iron ligand. To assess the requirements for the maturation of NrfB, the nrfB gene was cloned into the expression vector pETBlue-1 to yield pNRFB6 and co-expressed with the cytochrome maturation (ccm) genes (encoded on pEG86) that encode the proteins required for the attachment of hemes to CXXCH motifs. Expression under aerobic conditions, where the expression of the native nrfEFG genes is suppressed, resulted in synthesis of holo-NrfB in the soluble fraction, which was maximal following induction with IPTG in the presence of the ccm genes (pEG86) (Fig 1D, lanes 6–10). Fractionation of cells established that the recombinant NrfB was localized in the periplasmic fraction, and purification yielded 100 mg of pure protein from 100 liters of culture, a 200-fold higher yield than that for the native protein. Analysis of this recombinant protein, using the techniques applied for native NrfA described above, showed it to be competent as an electron donor to NrfA and to have similar spectroscopic and redox properties as the native protein. An illustration of this finding is shown in the EPR spectrum (Fig 5, C and D). As for native NrfB, both high gmax (g ≈ 3.57) and rhombic signals (g ≈ 2.99, 2.27, and 1.5) are present, indicative of hemes with near-parallel and near-perpendicular imidazole ligands, and they integrate to yield a 3:2 ratio. Efforts to express cloned nrfA under similar conditions were unsuccessful. This result indicates that the products of nrfEFG, which are required for correct folding and heme insertion into NrfA, are not required for NrfB. This observation is consistent with the spectroscopic evidence that, unlike NrfA, all five NrfB hemes are low spin bis-His coordinated species.DISCUSSIONThis work has provided the first purification and spectropotentiometric characterization of the NrfB cytochrome from any source.

In this study we mutated residues contributing to potential calcium binding sites in the AB and B helices in each of the four domains (eight sites in total) and in DE helices in the first, second, and third domains (three sites in total). We measured the affinity of each protein for phospholipid vesicles and cell membranes by quantitative calcium titration under low occupancy conditions (<1% saturation of available membrane binding sites). Affinity was calculated from the midpoint and slope of the calcium titration curve and the concentration of membrane binding sites. The results showed that all four AB sites were essential for high affinity binding, as were three of the four B sites (in domains 1, 2, and 3); the DE site in the first domain made a slight contribution to affinity. Multisite mutants showed that each domain contributed additively and independently to binding affinity; in contrast, AB and B sites within the same domain were interdependent. The number of functionally important sites identified was consistent with the Hill coefficient observed in calcium titrations. This study shows an essential and previously unappreciated role for B-helix calcium binding sites in the membrane binding of annexins and indicates that all four domains of the molecule are required for maximum membrane binding affinity.

Med. 2003; 44: 391-396PubMed Google Scholar), creating a need to better understand structural and functional properties relevant to its clinical use. Novel engineered forms of annexin V are being developed to improve its utility for imaging (11Tait J.F. Brown D.S. Gibson D.F. Blankenberg F.G. Strauss H.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000; 11: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Tait J.F. Smith C. Gibson D.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and there has been a recent report of a single-domain version of annexin V that may be useful for imaging cell death in vivo (13Blondel A. Vuillemard C. Tavitian B. Turhan A.G. Poupon M.F. Kato M. Nakashima I. Syrota A. Sanson A. Russo-Marie F. J. Nucl. Med. 2003; 44: 98PPubMed Google Scholar). Calcium binding sites in annexins are of three structural types: AB (or Type II), DE (or Type III), and B or AB′ (14Seaton B.A. Seaton B.A. Annexins: Molecular Structure to Cellular Function. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996: 15-29Google Scholar). In these binding sites, calcium ligands consist of one to three carbonyl oxygens from the protein backbone, and one carboxyl group from an Asp or Glu residue; sites are often named based on the domain (1 through 4) and α-helices (A through E), which contribute the backbone carbonyl ligands. However, the number of calcium ions observed in different structures varies widely; for example, anywhere from 2 or 3 (15Lewit-Bentley A. Morera S. Huber R. Bodo G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Huber R. Berendes R. Burger A. Schneider M. Karshikov A. Luecke H. Romisch J. Paques E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 683-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) to 10 (17Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) calcium ions have been observed in different crystal forms of annexin V. Thus, it has been difficult to determine which calcium binding sites are functionally important based on structural data alone. Previous work with annexin V mutants indicated that the AB site in domain 1 was the most important and perhaps the sole determinant of the calcium-dependent membrane binding affinity: a triple mutant lacking AB sites in domains 2, 3, and 4 had essentially the same apparent affinity as the wild-type protein (18Montaville P. Neumann J.-M. Russo-Marie F. Ochsenbein F. Sanson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24684-24693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of AB sites in annexins I, II, and IV have concluded that between one and three AB sites determine the membrane binding affinity of the protein; the DE sites make little or no contribution to binding affinity (19Bitto E. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10231-10237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Jost M. Weber K. Gerke V. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Nelson M.R. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3121-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The potential significance of the B sites has apparently not been investigated for any annexin. In contrast to earlier studies with annexin V (18Montaville P. Neumann J.-M. Russo-Marie F. Ochsenbein F. Sanson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24684-24693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S. Russo-Marie F. Geny B.

J. 1998; 330: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), our recent work (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggested indirectly that there may be many more calcium binding sites that are important for annexin V-membrane binding: the Hill coefficient with respect to calcium was eight for binding to cells and vesicles, suggesting involvement of many more sites than just the first-domain AB site, or even all four AB sites. We therefore decided to systematically investigate the number of functionally important calcium binding sites in annexin V. In this study, we examined four AB sites, four B sites, and three DE sites in annexin V by preparing individual mutants and combinations of mutants in either the same domain or different domains. We measured their membrane binding properties with newly developed assays (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that provide better quantitative measures of the affinity and cooperativity of binding than most of the earlier methods. We find that three of the B sites play an essential and previously unappreciated role in determining membrane binding affinity. All four AB sites are also required for optimum membrane binding. These findings will help to guide the design of improved imaging agents based on annexin V to detect cell death during organ transplant rejection, cancer chemotherapy, and myocardial infarction. Site-specific Mutagenesis—A base plasmid (pJ128) was first constructed in the pETBlue-1 vector background (Novagen, Madison, WI) to express a 325-amino acid protein (named annexin V-128) similar to wild-type human annexin V but with these changes: 1) an N-terminal extension of (Met)-Ala-Gly-Gly-Cys-Gly-His; 2) deletion of the initiator Met at position 1 of wild-type annexin V; and 3) a point mutation Cys-316 → Ser, to eliminate the single Cys residue present in wild-type annexin V. The calculated molecular mass of annexin V-128 is 36,272, assuming post-translational removal of the initiator methionine. (Annexin V-128 has the same amino acid sequence as annexin V-117 (11Tait J.F. Brown D.S. Gibson D.F. Blankenberg F.G. Strauss H.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000; 11: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except for deletion of the initiator Met residue of wild-type annexin V.) Point mutations to delete one or more calcium binding sites were then performed in the pJ128 vector background with the QuikChange Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sequences of the oligonucleotides used are available from the authors. After construction and cloning, each mutant vector was sequenced through the entire protein-coding region to verify the presence of the desired mutation(s) and the absence of unintended mutations. Each annexin V mutant protein was named with an arbitrary numerical suffix. Expression, Purification, and Iodoacetamidofluorescein Labeling of Annexin V Mutants—For protein expression, plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain Tuner (DE3) pLacI (Novagen, Madison, WI), single were colonies isolated, and glycerol stocks were prepared. T broth (500 ml) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin was inoculated with 50 μl of glycerol stock, and the culture was grown for 19hat37 °C with shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation; plasmid DNA was prepared from an aliquot of these cells and resequenced to verify that the mutant plasmid had not been lost from the cells during culture. Proteins were purified by a modification of the method of a previous study (11Tait J.F. Brown D.S. Gibson D.F. Blankenberg F.G. Strauss H.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000; 11: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, with 10 mm calcium chloride for wild-type and single site mutants, 20 mm calcium for double AB site mutants, and 40 mm calcium for triple and quadruple AB site mutants. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and the annexin was released from the pellet with 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, containing EDTA at twice the concentration of calcium used in the previous step. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 3 liters of 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Protein was then treated with Benzonase nuclease (10 units/ml for 6–8 h in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2) to digest DNA and RNA, then dialyzed against two changes of 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, then three to five changes of the same buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein solution was concentrated to 3–9 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The average yield at this purification step was 40 ± 16 mg of protein/liter of cell culture. The protein was applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris HCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. The protein was eluted at 2 ml/min with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 m in the same buffer. All mutant proteins eluted with a single major peak around 0.2 m NaCl. Protein purity was ≥98% as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining. The purified proteins were then concentrated as needed and stored at –70 °C. Proteins were quantitated with an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 0.6 ml/mg·cm (25Funakoshi T. Heimark R.L. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled with IAF 1The abbreviations used are: IAF, iodoacetamidofluorescein; EC50, calcium concentration causing 50% of maximum protein-membrane binding; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; R-PE, rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine; pK, negative logarithm of equilibrium dissociation constant K; RBC, red blood cell. as described (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and purified after labeling with the same MonoQ chromatography step used for unlabeled proteins. Vesicle and Cell Binding Assays—Affinities of mutant proteins for phospholipid vesicles and RBC with exposed PS were measured by calcium titration under conditions of low membrane occupancy as described by Tait et al. (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, vesicle binding assays were performed at 25 °C with 1 nm IAF-protein and 10 μm vesicles containing 25% PS and 2% R-PE in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. A concentration of 10 μm vesicles corresponds to 100 nm of binding sites assuming about 100 phospholipid molecules per binding site (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the vesicle membrane was therefore ≤1% saturated with protein throughout the titration. RBC binding assays were performed with 1 nm IAF-protein and 1 × 108 cells in 1 ml of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of binding sites was about 180 nm, assuming that each RBC contains 1.1 × 106 binding sites (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the membrane was therefore ≤0.6% saturated with protein throughout the titration. Calcium titrations were analyzed as described (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) based on the following model of the binding reaction between calcium ions, annexin V, and membrane binding sites: nCa+Protein+Membrane↔Protein·Membrane·CanREACTION 1 K=[Ca]n[Membrane][Protein]/[Protein·Membrane·Can](Eq. 1) K=EC50n[Membrane](Eq. 2) pK=−log K=−(n log EC50+log[Membrane])(Eq. 3) The EC50 and Hill coefficient values were determined by non-linear least-squares fitting of the calcium titration curves as described previously (24Tait J.F. Gibson D.F. Smith C. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 329: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For simplicity of comparison among different mutants, pK values were calculated as the negative logarithm of the respective equilibrium dissociation constant. Calcium Stoichiometry Assay—The stoichiometry of calcium binding was measured with a titration procedure modified from the vesicle binding assay. The binding reaction was carried out at high concentrations of both protein and phospholipid using vesicles with high PS content and a buffer of low ionic strength; all these factors ensured that the binding reaction is limited solely by the availability of calcium. Thus, once a critical calcium threshold is reached, essentially all added calcium is taken up in the formation of the membrane-protein-calcium complex, and the stoichiometry can be calculated from the maximum fluorescence quenching divided by the known protein concentration and the slope of the linear portion of the calcium titration curve. Calcium stock solution (1 m) was prepared in water from ultrapure calcium chloride (99.99%; Aldrich), and the concentration was determined by refractometry. Protein solutions were dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 3 mm NaN3, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter, and quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21,500 m–1 cm–1 (25Funakoshi T. Heimark R.L. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5572-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26Funakoshi T. Hendrickson L.E. McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The same extinction coefficient was used for all mutant proteins, because they all have the same number of aromatic amino acids as wild-type annexin V. Reactions were prepared in a quartz cuvette at 25 °C with 2 mm phospholipid vesicles (containing 2% R-PE, 50% PS, 28% PC, and 20% diheptanoyl-PC), 20 μm unlabeled annexin, 10 nm IAF-labeled annexin, in 0.8 ml of 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4, 3 mm NaN3, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol. The cuvette was mixed by inversion, and the baseline fluorescence intensity was measured. Aliquots of calcium (3 or 6 μl of 4 mm dilution in assay buffer) were added stepwise; after each addition the cuvette was mixed once by inversion, and the fluorescence intensity was read on an SLM 8000C fluorometer with excitation at 495 ± 4 nm and emission at 520 ± 10 nm. Titration was continued until fluorescence quenching had reached a plateau at a saturating calcium concentration. All fluorescence readings were corrected for background fluorescence and for the dilution due to the addition of calcium stock solution. Production and Characterization of Mutant Proteins—A total of eleven potential calcium binding sites were selected for study: four AB sites, four B sites, and three DE sites. There is crystallographic evidence (17Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) for calcium binding to all of these sites except the fourth-domain B site. In most cases, the calcium binding site was inactivated by replacing the capping aspartate or glutamate residue with asparagine or glutamine (Fig. 1), because this change would be nearly isosteric and would therefore have the least potential effect on protein structure. One exception was the 2DE site, where the wild-type residue is already glutamine, which was therefore replaced with alanine. In addition, alanine mutants were also prepared for the 3AB, 1DE, and 3DE sites to verify results obtained with the corresponding glutamine mutants at these sites. The mutant proteins developed for this study are summarized in Tables I, II, III. The mutant proteins were built on a base molecule (annexin V-128), which has a short N-terminal extension containing a single Cys residue to allow site-specific labeling with fluorescein. The addition of the short N-terminal extension did not affect binding affinity (Table II, wild-type versus annexin V-128), as expected based on previous work (11Tait J.F. Brown D.S. Gibson D.F. Blankenberg F.G. Strauss H.W. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000; 11: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 12Tait J.F. Smith C. Gibson D.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Each protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and labeled stoichiometrically with IAF at the single N-terminal Cys residue. Several lines of evidences showed there were no gross structural changes in the mutant proteins. The expression yields of all proteins were comparable to that of the wild-type control within ± 50%, implying that the one or more mutations did not cause gross structural changes leading to instability or aggregation in vitro or in vivo. All proteins showed very similar chromatographic behavior on the MonoQ column, with a single major sharp peak. Crystallographic analysis of the annexin V-128 protein and the two proteins with mutations in the third-domain AB site (E228A and E 228Q mutants) showed that all three proteins had the same global conformation as wild-type annexin V. 2Personal communication from Dr. Barbara Seaton. Previous published work has also shown that E72Q, D144N, E228A, and D303N mutants have the same circular dichroism spectrum as wild-type protein (22Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S. Russo-Marie F. Geny B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10474-10482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the E78Q mutant has the same three-dimensional structure as wild-type protein (27Burger A. Voges D. Demange P. Perez C.R. Huber R. Berendes R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 479-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that the mutations introduced into these proteins did not cause instability or global conformational or structural changes.Table IStoichiometry of calcium binding to mutant proteinsMutant domainMutationProtein suffixMol Ca2+/mol proteinS.D.Number of assaysp value versus wild-typeNoneNone12813.80.97201ABE72Q13812.60.1730.0052ABD144N13412.90.1530.0373ABE228Q132Q11.40.353<0.0013ABE228A132A10.90.153<0.0014ABD303N13112.40.1230.0011BE35Q15411.90.212<0.0012BE107Q15611.50.314<0.0013BE191Q15712.40.8620.1394BD266N15911.60.142<0.001Mean AB and B single mutants12.01AB,1BE35Q,E72Q16012.10.6230.0083AB,3BE191Q,E228Q16212.30.9830.045Mean AB/B double mutants12.21DEE78A19112.01.2730.0702DEQ150A19212.70.8630.0733DEE234A19312.30.7830.029 Open table in a new tab Table IIBinding parameters for mutant proteins in RBC assayMutant domain(s)MutationProtein suffixEC50Hill coefficientBinding affinitymmpKNoneNonewt1.20 ± 0.318.0 ± 0.6730.1 ± 2.16NoneNone1171.258.230.5NoneNone1281.248.230.6Mean, wt1.238.230.41DEE78Q,A155,1911.508.029.32DEQ150A1921.227.929.83DEE234Q,A158,1931.058.130.9Mean, single DE1.268.030.01ABE72Q1382.69 ± 0.196.1 ± 0.5822.4 ± 1.472ABD144N1343.125.119.53ABE228Q,A132Q,A2.165.320.74ABD303N1312.746.122.4Mean, single AB2.685.621.31BE35Q1541.776.123.52BE107Q1561.916.424.13BE191Q1572.904.417.94BD266N1591.237.829.4Mean, single B1.956.223.81AB and 1BE35Q,E72Q1602.656.222.72AB and 2BE107Q,E144Q1614.274.216.73AB and 3BE191Q,E228Q1622.425.120.14AB and 4BD266N,D303N1632.406.423.5Mean, AB and B2.945.520.71, 2ABE72Q,D144N1428.69 ± 1.214.0 ± 0.5314.9 ± 1.231, 3ABE72Q,E228Q1408.842.812.61, 4ABE72Q,D303N1397.134.215.82, 3ABD144N,E228Q1365.323.113.92, 4ABD144N,D303N13510.253.613.93, 4ABE228Q,D303N1338.213.614.4Mean, double AB8.053.514.31, 2BE35Q,E107Q1643.346.121.81, 3BE35Q,E191Q1655.934.416.52, 3BE107Q,E191Q1675.854.316.33, 4BE191Q,D266N1693.164.919.0Mean, double B4.984.517.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIIBinding parameters for mutant AB site proteins in vesicle assayMutant domain(s)MutationProtein suffixEC50Hill coefficientBinding affinitymmpKNoneNone1170.148 ± 0.0088.0 ± 1.537.7 ± 5.4NoneNone1280.145 ± 0.0127.5 ± 1.036.0 ± 4.01E72Q1380.387 ± 0.0386.5 ± 1.529.2 ± 5.32D144N1340.2905.927.93E228Q1320.2065.527.44D303N1310.3515.927.5Mean, single mutants0.3096.028.01, 2E72Q,D144N1420.960 ± 0.0605.8 ± 1.124.5 ± 3.41, 3E72Q,E228Q1400.8124.621.31, 4E72Q,D303N1390.8765.925.02, 3D144N,E228Q1360.2843.619.82, 4D144N,D303N1350.8943.919.03, 4E228Q,D303N1330.6514.521.3Mean, double mutants0.7464.721.81, 2, 3E72Q,D144N,E228Q1443.35 ± 0.672.8 ± 0.613.9 ± 1.31, 2, 4E72Q,D144N,D303N1434.994.116.51, 3, 4E72Q,E228Q,D303N1414.653.615.42, 3, 4D144N,E228Q,D303N1371.581.411.0Mean, triple mutants3.65314.2NoneaAssayed with vesicles containing 50% PS at 0.05 m ionic strength.None1280.015 ± 0.0038.1 ± 1.746.2 ± 7.11, 2, 3, 4aAssayed with vesicles containing 50% PS at 0.05 m ionic strength.E72Q,D144N,E228Q,D303N1451.88 ± 0.722.9 ± 1.314.9 ± 4.0a Assayed with vesicles containing 50% PS at 0.05 m ionic strength. Open table in a new tab To verify that the mutations had destroyed a calcium binding site, we measured the stoichiometry of calcium binding to wild-type and mutant proteins under conditions in which calcium is the limiting factor in formation of the protein-membrane-calcium complex (Table I). For all mutant proteins tested, there was a decrease in calcium binding compared with the wild-type control, confirming that all mutations were capable of decreasing calcium uptake in the protein-membrane complex. For the AB and B single site mutations as a group, the average reduction in calcium binding was 1.8 ± 0.27 mol/mol (mean ± S.E.), suggesting that disruption of a single AB or B site may decrease calcium binding at another site, probably the adjacent AB or B site in the same domain (see binding affinity measurements below). Consistent with this view, analysis of two double mutants with mutations in the AB and B sites within the same domain also showed about the same reduction in calcium binding (1.6 ± 0.40 mol/mol, mean ± S.E.) as the single site mutants. Binding Affinity of Single Site Mutants—The binding affinities of single site mutants were measured in calcium titrations performed with the RBC binding assay under conditions of low membrane occupancy (Fig. 2 and Table II). Mutation of any one of the four AB sites caused a reduction in binding affinity (Fig. 2A). Similarly, single mutations in the B sites in domains 1, 2, or 3 decreased binding affinity substantially; only the mutation in domain 4 was silent (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mutation of the DE site in domain 1 had only a very slight effect on binding affinity, and mutations of DE sites in domains 2 and 3 were silent (Fig. 2C). These results were confirmed with the vesicle binding assay (Table III for AB mutants; data not shown for B and DE mutants), indicating that the mutations had the same effect on binding to both cellular membranes (containing phospholipids, cholesterol, and other substances) and artificial membranes (containing only phospholipid). Thus, a total of eight calcium binding sites were identified that affected membrane binding affinity under low occupancy conditions. Because a previous mutagenesis study of annexin V used alanine instead of glutamine as the substituting residue in the third-domain AB site (22Mira J.P. Dubois T. Oudinet J.P. Lukowski S.

This protein had the same binding properties as the glutamine mutant (E228Q), thus indicating that any differences with the earlier study were not due to subtle differences in the domain-3 mutant proteins. We also prepared E78A and E234A mutants for the 1DE and 3DE sites; these proteins had the same binding affinity as the E78Q and E234Q mutants, indicating that the side-chain carbonyl group of glutamine in the E78Q and E234Q mutants was not contributing to a putative high affinity calcium binding site under these conditions. Mutation of AB and B Sites within the Same Domain—To determine whether AB and B sites within the same domain had an additive effect on membrane binding affinity, double mutants were prepared and tested (Fig. 3 and Table II). The AB plus B double mutants did not have significantly lower pK values than the corresponding AB single mutants. Similarly, the AB plus B double mutants were similar to the B single mutants, with the exception of domain 4. The same overall pattern held for comparison of Hill coefficients between single and double mutants, consistent with the results of calcium stoichiometry measurements (see above). Thus, the AB and B sites within a domain are interdependent, with a change in one affecting the properties of the other. Mutation of Multiple AB and B Sites in Different Domains—To determine whether calcium binding sites interacted between domains, multisite AB mutants were prepared and assayed in the vesicle binding assay (Table III and Fig. 4). (The vesicle binding assay was used primarily because the triple and quadruple mutants had affinities too weak to measure reliably in the RBC binding ass"
https://openalex.org/W2123644397,"Protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2B (calcineurin) are eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatases that share 40% sequence identity in their catalytic subunits. Despite the similarities in sequence, these phosphatases are widely divergent when it comes to inhibition by natural product toxins, such as microcystin-LR and okadaic acid. The most prominent region of non-conserved sequence between these phosphatases corresponds to the β12-β13 loop of protein phosphatase-1, and the L7 loop of toxin-resistant calcineurin. In the present study, mutagenesis of residues 273-277 of the β12-β13 loop of the protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP-1c) to the corresponding residues in calcineurin (312-316), resulted in a chimeric mutant that showed a decrease in sensitivity to microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, and the endogenous PP-1c inhibitor protein inhibitor-2. A crystal structure of the chimeric mutant in complex with okadaic acid was determined to 2.0-Å resolution. The β12-β13 loop region of the mutant superimposes closely with that of wild-type PP-1c bound to okadaic acid. Systematic mutation of each residue in the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c showed that a single amino acid change (C273L) was the most influential in mediating sensitivity of PP-1c to toxins. Taken together, these data indicate that it is an individual amino acid residue substitution and not a change in the overall β12-β13 loop conformation of protein phosphatase-1 that contributes to disrupting important interactions with inhibitors such as microcystin-LR and okadaic acid.

Protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: PP-1, protein phosphatase-1; MCLR, microcystin-LR; OA, okadaic acid. is a member of the phosphoprotein phosphatase gene family, whose members share 40% sequence identity in the catalytic subunit (PP-1c) and includes protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) and protein phosphatase-2B (PP-2B or calcineurin) (1Cohen P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A striking structural similarity is seen upon superimposition of the crystal structures of PP-1c and the calcineurin catalytic subunit (calcineurin A), especially in the active site regions (the structure of PP-2A has not been determined). Despite the similarities in sequence and structure, PP-1c and calcineurin A have distinct inhibitor and substrate specificities. PP-1c is sensitive to the endogenous inhibitor proteins inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2, as well as to the exogenous marine natural product inhibitors microcystin-LR (MCLR) and okadaic acid (OA). Calcineurin is markedly less sensitive to these inhibitors (250-fold for OA and over 1000-fold for the microcystins) (2Sheppeck 2nd, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med.

One region of sequence dissimilarity between PP-1c, PP-2Ac, and calcineurin A is the β12-β13 loop region of PP-1c/PP-2Ac (residues 273 to 277 in PP-1c and 266 to 270 in PP-2Ac), which corresponds to the L7 loop of calcineurin A (residues 312-316). Residues of the β12-β13 loop region have previously been implicated in inhibitor selectivity (6Watanabe T. Huang H.B. Horiuchi A. da Cruze Silva E.F. Hsieh-Wilson L. Allen P.B. Shenolikar S.

The importance of this region was first discovered when an okadaic acid-resistant isoform of PP-2A in Chinese hamster ovary cells was found to have a mutation in Cys269 (9Shima H. Tohda H. Aonuma S.

The corresponding residues in PP-1c and calcineurin A are Phe276 and Tyr315. Because PP-2Ac is much more sensitive to okadaic acid (IC50 = 0.2 nm) than PP-1c (IC50 = 20-50 nm) or calcineurin (IC50 = 5 μm), the presence of a cysteine at this position may be responsible for its higher sensitivity to okadaic acid. Further mutagenesis studies were carried out in PP-1c that confirmed the importance of the β12-β13 loop region in inhibitor sensitivity, as well as in enzyme activity (6Watanabe T. Huang H.B.

Structural studies have shed light on the nature and importance of the β12-β13 loop in PP-1c in the context of inhibitor binding. The hydroxyl of Tyr272 in the β12-β13 loop was analyzed in four different crystals of the same PP-1c·tungstate complex and found to have a metal to hydroxyl contact distance ranging from 3.0 to 4.3 Å, suggesting flexibility in the loop region (13Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Flexibility is also noted in differences between the structures of PP-1c bound to MCLR, okadaic acid, tungstate, and calyculin A (13Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol.

These differences may be indicative of the covalent bond formed between MCLR and Cys273 (PP-1c), which is not needed for inhibition (17Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18MacKintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. MacKintosh C.

Before the structure of OA-bound to PP-1c had been determined, it had been hypothesized that the different conformations of the L7 loop in calcineurin and the corresponding β12-β13 loop in PP-1c were the reason for the resistance of calcineurin to toxins (17Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Dawson J.F. Luu H.A. Bagu J.R. Holmes C.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, upon superimposition of the PP-1c-OA and calcineurin A structures, it was noted that the backbone atoms of the two loops superimpose. This led to our hypothesis that the resistance of calcineurin to toxins was mainly because of primary sequence differences in the C-terminal end of the L7 loop of calcineurin and the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c/PP-2Ac (19Holmes C.F. Maynes J.T. Perreault K.R. Dawson J.F. James M.N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This solidifies the idea that the differences seen in the MCLR-bound PP1-c structure are not typical and are caused by the covalent reaction (14Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis concerning the importance of the primary sequence on inhibitor potential, we created a chimeric mutant of PP-1c in which the β12-β13 loop residues of PP-1c (273CGEFD277) were substituted with the L7 loop residues of calcineurin A (312LDVYN316). We analyzed this PP-1c-CaN mutant via crystallographic and kinetic studies to probe further the reason for PP1-c sensitivity and the resistance to toxins and inhibitor proteins for calcineurin.

A single colony of E. coli DH5α cells transformed with plasmid pCW-HPP-1γ was used to inoculate 100 ml of Luria-Bertani media containing 1 mm MnCl2 and ampicillin (54 μm). After overnight growth at 37 °C, this culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria-Bertani media containing 1 mm MnCl2 and ampicillin (54 μm) and grown to optical density 0.5 at 600 nm. Expression was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for up to 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 45 min at 4,000 × g and either frozen at -70 °C or used immediately. Bacterial cells from two 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.0 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 mm benzamidine, 3.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) containing 100 mm NaCl, sonicated, and centrifuged for 60 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Amersham Biosciences). PP-1c was eluted in buffer A by a linear 400-ml gradient of 0.1-0.6 m NaCl. Activity of fractions was determined by the colorimetric para-nitrophenol phosphate assay (Sigma). Active fractions were pooled and diluted to 3× volume in buffer B (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 3.0 mm MnCl2, 2.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.0 mm benzamidine, 3.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (v/v)). The fractions were then loaded onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and eluted in buffer B by a 160-ml linear gradient of 50-400 mm NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to a 2-ml volume in a Centriprep-10 concentrator (Amicon) before loading onto a HiLoad Superdex 75 HR 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer C (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.0 mm MnCl2, 2.0 mm benzamidine, 3.0 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v)) plus 0.3 m NaCl). The PP-1c was eluted by an isocratic 180-ml gradient of buffer C plus 0.3 m NaCl. Active fractions, adjudged homogeneously pure by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and concentrated to ∼0.2-1.0 mg/ml in a Centriprep-10 concentrator. An equal volume of glycerol was added and the solution stored at -20 °C. The specific activities of the wild type and mutant enzymes were measured using the phosphorylase a assay (described below), and found to range between 2 and 11 units/mg. Phosphatase Assays—32P-Labeled phosphorylase a was used as a phosphatase substrate to determine dose-response curves with microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, and inhibitor-2. Purified PP-1c stocks were diluted in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.8 mm MnCl2, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol). Phosphatase was diluted until a 10-μl aliquot of diluted enzyme solution caused 15% 32P release in a 30-μl assay (20Dawson J.F. Luu H.A. Bagu J.R. Holmes C.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Typically, less than 5% variation was seen between duplicates. Microcystin-LR was obtained from Health Canada, okadaic acid from Moana Bioproducts, and recombinant inhibitor-2 was purified from E. coli. The loop mutant protein phosphatase-1 exhibited normal activity toward phosphorylase a as a substrate. Crystallization of PP1-loop·OA Complex—Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The enzyme and okadaic acid were mixed in a 1:2 molar ratio with the concentration of protein being ∼0.4 mm. The PP1-c·OA complex was then mixed with an equivalent volume of mother liquor, which consisted of 2 m lithium sulfate, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 2% polyethylene glycol 400, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The complex crystallized in the space group P42212 with cell dimensions a = b = 98.8 Å, c = 62.2 Å, with one complex per asymmetric unit. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—A data set to 2.0 Å was collected at 100 K on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator equipped with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. The data were processed with the HKL suite of programs (24Otwinowski M. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). This initial structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (25Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), using the PP-1c-OA structure (with OA removed) as a search model (Protein Data Bank number 1JK7). Electron density for both the protein and the inhibitor were clear from the initial map generated from the molecular replacement solution. OA was fitted to the difference density using the structure of OA bound to wild type PP-1c as a starting model. The protein-inhibitor model was subjected to rigid body refinement in CNS prior to manually fitting the model using the program XtalView (26McRee D.E. Struct.

Inhibition and Substrate Specificity of Wild-type and Loop Mutant PP-1c—To understand the role of the β12-β13 loop region of PP-1c in inhibitor selectivity further, we examined the inhibitory effects of both natural product inhibitors and an endogenous inhibitor protein (inhibitor-2) on a mutant of PP-1c in the β12-β13 loop region (Table II). This mutant (herein referred to as the “loop mutant”) has residues 273-277 of PP-1c substituted with the corresponding residues of calcineurin A (residues 312-316) (Fig. 1). This loop mutant has allowed us to investigate the role of this non-conserved portion of the type 1, 2A, and 2B (calcineurin) phosphatases in inhibitor selectivity.Table IIKinetic dataPP1 typeSpecific activityIC50 (nm)Microcystin-LROkadaic acidInhibitor-2units/mgWild-type110.1 ± 0.0132 ± 21.8 ± 0.5Loop mutant4> 0.697 ± 55.4 ± 2.3 Open table in a new tab Wild-type PP-1c was inhibited by okadaic acid with an IC50 of 30 nm and microcystin-LR with an IC50 of 0.1 nm. The loop mutant was ∼4-fold less sensitive to okadaic acid (IC50 = 110-120 nm) and at least 6-fold less sensitive to microcystin-LR (IC50 = >0.6 nm). Inhibitor-2 inhibited PP-1c with an IC50 of 1-3 nm. The loop mutant was less sensitive to inhibitor-2 inhibition (IC50 = 5-6 nm). The resistance of the loop mutant of PP-1c to all inhibitors studied is consistent with the hypothesis that the residues of the β12-β13 loop region of PP-1c play a role in inhibitor selectivity. Crystal Structure of PP-1c-loop·OA Complex—The structure observed of the loop mutant PP-1c bound to okadaic acid is very similar to other PP-1c structures (0.22 Å Cα r.m.s. deviation to wild-type PP-1c:OA, 0.55/0.54 Å Cα r.m.s. deviation to PP-1c: MCLR (two in the asymmetric unit), 0.51/0.53 Å Cα r.m.s. deviation to PP-1c:tungstate (two in the asymmetric unit), 0.45/0.48 Å Cα r.m.s. deviation to PP-1c:calyculin (two in the asymmetric unit), all measurements taken over 284 Cα atoms). The orientation of OA in the active site is indistinguishable from that seen with the wild-type enzyme, with the OA adopting a cyclic conformation via an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the C1-acid and the C24-hydroxyl (Fig. 2). Similarly, all contacts between the enzyme and the inhibitor are seen in both the wild-type and loop mutant complexes. Namely, this involves the hydrophobic double ring spiroketal moiety of OA binding into the hydrophobic cleft of PP-1c created by residues Ile130, Ile133, Trp206, and Val223 and hydrogen bonding interactions between Tyr272 and the C1-acid and C2-hydroxyl, Arg221 and the C24-hydroxl and Arg96 (Nϵ) and the C2-hydroxyl. The conclusion that hydrophobic energy drives complex formation is supported by this structure because there are very few protein-inhibitor interactions (given the size of the inhibitor) and the strength of these interactions is on a par with the interactions seen in the wild-type PP-1c·okadaic acid complex (15Maynes J.T. Bateman K.S. Cherney M.M. Das A.K. Luu H.A. Holmes C.F. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44078-44082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The residue changes within the β12-β13 loop involve substitution of the sequence 273CGEFD277 with LDVYN from calcineurin A. Because the orientation of the backbone atoms in both the wild-type and the loop mutant remains the same, this leaves side chain alterations as possible reasons for inhibitor specificity. Although these substitutions may be expected to affect overall negative charge in the β12-β13 loop of the chimeric mutant, the two most prominent residues that have potential inhibitor interactions are Leu273 and Tyr276. The leucine (Leu273) lies near a hydrophobic area of OA (C10-methyl, Fig. 2), potentially securing a hydrophobic section of the molecule. With respect to the position of Tyr276, the equivalent residue in wild-type PP-1c (Phe276) lies near the same hydrophobic section of OA, again potentially securing this area. The electron density for Phe276 is very well defined in wild-type PP-1c; it has an average side chain thermal factor of 24 Å2 above the average thermal factor for the molecule (Fig. 3). In the loop mutant the electron density of Tyr276 is very poorly defined with an average side chain thermal factor of 31 Å2 above the average thermal factor for the rest of the molecule (in comparison all four structures of calcineurin have values for the equivalent residue (Tyr315) that are maximally 19 Å2 above the average thermal factor for the rest of the enzyme). The tyrosine side chain in this position would not have the potential for hydrophobic interactions that the phenylalanine in wild-type PP-1c possesses. The conclusion that hydrophobic energy drives inhibitor binding in the phosphoprotein phosphatase M family may involve binding of the hydrophobic tail (that many of the inhibitors contain) and also a hydrophobic binding closer to the active site involving residue 276. Inhibitor Binding Is Partially Determined by Residues of the β12-β13 Loop—Our kinetic data show that the L7 loop of calcineurin A and β12-β13 loop of PP-1c partially determine inhibitor specificity. Within this loop, there are few candidate residues that could confer this specificity. Tyr272 has the greatest potential for impact because it forms the most intimate contacts with the inhibitors, hydrogen bonding with the C1 acid moiety of OA, the phosphate group of calyculin A, and the acidic moiety in MCLR. Tyr272 is also important in binding of calyculin A and tautomycin because the mutation Y272F causes a 200- and 400-fold decrease in sensitivity to these toxins (11Zhang L. Zhang Z. Long F. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1606-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This residue is, however, conserved as a tyrosine in both PP-1c and calcineurin A. To determine the individual contributions of the remaining residues within the β12-β13 loop toward inhibitor resistance, we undertook to mutate systematically and express the single point mutations of residues 273-277 from PP-1c to their corresponding residues in calcineurin A. With respect to okadaic acid inhibition (Figs. 4, A and B), PP-1c G274D, E275V, F276T, and D277N were inhibited by this toxin as potently as the wild-type enzyme (IC50 = 30-50 nm). In contrast, a single point mutant, PP-1c C273L (IC50 = 120 nm), showed ∼4-fold resistance to inhibition over wild type. This resistance was close to that exhibited by the full PP-1c loop mutant (IC50 = 110 nm). With respect to microcystin-LR inhibition (Fig. 5, A and B), PP-1c G274D, E275V, F276Y, and D277N mutant enzymes were again inhibited by this toxin as potently as the wild-type enzyme (IC50 = 0.1-0.2 nm). In contrast, the single point mutant PP-1c C273L (IC50 = > 0.6 nm) was as strongly resistant to toxin inhibition as the full PP-1c loop mutant (IC50 = > 0.6 nm). Unlike toxin inhibition of PP-1c mutants, the PP-1c C273L mutant was not resistant to inhibition by inhibitor-2 (Fig. 6) and this mutant, as well as PP-1c G274D, E275V, and D277N mutant enzymes, was inhibited as strongly as the wild-type enzyme (IC50 = 1-3 nm). Only the PP-1c loop mutant showed resistance to inhibition by inhibitor-2 (IC50 = 5-6 nm). Protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase-2B (calcineurin) share 40% sequence identity in their catalytic subunits. Despite the similarities in sequence, these phosphatases are widely divergent when it comes to inhibition by both endogenous proteins, such as protein phosphatase inhibitor-2, and natural product toxins, such as microcystin-LR and okadaic acid. One of the more prominent regions of non-conserved sequence between these phosphatases corresponds to the β12-β13 loop of protein phosphatase-1, and the L7 loop of calcineurin. In the present study, mutagenesis of residues 273-277 of the β12-β13 loop of protein phosphatase-1 to the corresponding residues in calcineurin (312-316), resulted in a chimeric mutant that showed a decrease in sensitivity to microcystin-LR, okadaic acid, and inhibitor-2. A crystal structure of the chimeric mutant in complex with okadaic acid was determined to 2.0-Å resolution. The purpose of determining this structure was to observe directly the differences in the β12-β13 loop structure between wild-type PP-1c and the loop mutant PP-1c, both bound to OA. This was examined in the context of the large structural changes seen in the PP-1c·MCLR complex that may have implicated structural changes in the loop as being indicative of inhibitor specificity. However, the backbone conformation of the loop (and the entire active site) is virtually unchanged in both the wild-type complex and the loop mutant (Fig. 7). When compared in a larger context, the loop has an extremely similar orientation in the tungstate-, OA-, and calyculin-bound forms. More strikingly, the L7 loop of calcineurin also has a virtually identical conformation to all these structures. The only anomaly is the PP-1c: MCLR structure where the covalent linkage to Cys273 may affect the loop position. This supports the proposition the that primary sequence, rather than the overall β12-β13 loop structure, determines the inhibitor specificity. A change in IC50 with chimeras of the β12-β13 loop region was reported before by Connor et al. (7Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), when they substituted the C terminus of PP-1c (residues 274 onwards) with the corresponding C terminus of PP-2Ac (7Connor J.H. Kleeman T. Barik S. Honkanen R.E. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22366-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The chimeric protein produced was not inhibited by either NIPP-1 or thiophosphorylated inhibitor-1 (neither of which inhibit PP-2A). Interestingly, the chimeric protein produced had the dose-response characteristics of PP-1 with respect to fostriecin and tautomycin, suggesting that the β12-β13 loop region is less important for inhibition by these natural products. We undertook to systematically mutate all residues in the β12-β13 loop region of PP-1c to their corresponding residues in calcineurin A. The point mutants created were PP-1c C273L, G274D, G275V, F276W, and D277N. We did not mutate Tyr272 as this residue is a Tyr in calcineurin A and our structural data showed that it adopted an identical conformation in the loop mutant PP-1c·OA complex (Fig. 7). The necessity to create single mutations in the β12-β13 loop region of PP-1c was suggested following the finding of a poorly defined electron density for Tyr276 in the loop mutant crystal structure. The corresponding residue in PP-2Ac, Cys269, has already been found to be important for okadaic acid sensitivity. Mutation of Phe276 to Cys in PP-1c increases the sensitivity of PP-1c to okadaic acid 40-fold, indicating that an even smaller hydrophobic residue at this position may facilitate tighter binding of okadaic acid (10Zhang Z. Zhao S. Long F. Zhang L. Bai G. Shima H. Nagao M. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16997-17000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Systematic mutation of each residue in the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c to their corresponding calcineurin A residue showed that a single amino acid change (C273L) was the most influential in mediating sensitivity of PP-1c to the toxin inhibitors microcystin-LR and okadaic acid. Taken together, these data indicate that an individual amino acid residue substitution (C273L, as occurs in calcineurin) and not a change in the overall β12-β13 loop conformation of PP-1c contributes to disrupting important interactions with inhibitors such as microcystin-LR and okadaic acid. MacKintosh et al. (18MacKintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) first showed that Cys273 binds covalently to microcystin-LR and determined that abolition of covalent binding (via mutation to Ala, Ser, or Leu) increased the IC50 for toxin inhibition of PP-1c by 5-20-fold. This is entirely consistent with our mutational analyses of the β12-β13 loop presented here. However, we have also shown that covalent modification of Cys273 by microcystin-LR occurs very slowly over several hours and only after the phosphatase is fully inhibited by the toxin (17Craig M. Luu H.A. McCready T.L. Williams D. Andersen R.J. Holmes C.F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 19Holmes C.F. Maynes J.T. Perreault K.R. Dawson J.F. James M.N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Taken together, the findings of these studies suggest that covalent modification of Cys273 is adventitious with respect to inhibition of the phosphatase and that this residue clearly plays a role in the initial inhibition of PP-1c by the microcystin toxins (19Holmes C.F. Maynes J.T. Perreault K.R. Dawson J.F. James M.N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with its important role in toxin interactions, Cys273 is conserved in virtually all known members of the PP-1c family. A notable exception being PP-1c from Dictyostelium discoideum (social amoeba) (30Andrioli L.P. Zaini P.A. Viviani W. Da Silva A.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 703-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is changed to Phe. The sensitivity to microcystin inhibition of this form of PP-1c was reported as ∼2-fold less than a “mutant” containing Cys269 (the equivalent residue in this organism). It is possible that Phe273 is more favorable for toxin inhibition in this position than Leu273 (present study and MacKintosh et al. (18MacKintosh R.W. Dalby K.N. Campbell D.G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. MacKintosh C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)), however, these experiments were conducted on unpurified recombinant protein from crude E. coli extracts. PP-1c from several plants, including Brassica napus, Arabidopsis thaliana TOPP 8, and Phaseolus vulgaris, have Cys273 changed to Gly (31MacKintosh R.W. Haycox G. Hardie D.G. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Lin Q. Li J. Smith R.D. Walker J.C. Plant Mol.

Crude extract preparations of B. napus PP-1c were reported to be as sensitive to inhibitors as mammalian PP-1c (34MacKintosh C. Beattie K.A. Klumpp S. Cohen P. Codd G.A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 35MacKintosh C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), however, it will be interesting to see whether homogeneous preparations of highly purified PP-1c from these organisms have any resistance to microcystin inhibition. In contrast to the role of Cys273 in mediating toxin inhibition of PP-1c, replacement of Cys273 with Leu did not affect inhibition of PP-1c by inhibitor-2. The only substitution that affected inhibitor-2 inhibition was F276Y, clearly indicating that the mode of inhibition of PP-1c by this endogenous inhibitor protein is distinct from that of the natural product/toxin inhibitors. The effect of substitutions in the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c on inhibition by inhibitor-2 are difficult to interpret because the three-dimensional structure of this protein bound to PP-1c is unknown. The differences in sensitivity to the inhibitor protein 2 between wild-type PP-1c and calcineurin A are much more dramatic than the differences between wild-type PP-1c and loop mutant PP-1c, clearly indicating that the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c is not the only region playing a role in binding of this inhibitor. Taken together, these data are consistent with the most recent models of inhibitor-2 binding (8Yang J. Hurley T.D. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22635-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The importance of the β12-β13 loop was emphasized in a recent structure of the complex between PP-1c and a 34-kDa fragment from myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT-1) (36Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This structure showed some active site remodeling with targeting subunit binding to the catalytic subunit but left the β12-β13 loop in a prominent position to influence enzymatic activity and inhibition. Elucidation of the sequence-specific role of the β12-β13 loop of PP-1c in mediating inhibition of this enzyme by toxins will now facilitate rational protein engineering of calcineurin A that is sensitive to toxin inhibition. This would be an essential first step in designing active site-directed inhibitors that would be specific for calcineurin. We thank Dr. David Barford for providing the coordinates of the PP-1c·tungstate complex."

Physically, the skeletal DHPRs are grouped in “tetrads,” and each DHPR within a tetrad is located in exact correspondence to one of the four subunits of RyR1 (1Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P.

Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Functionally, a bidirectional interaction occurs in skeletal muscle between the DHPR and RyR1. Depolarization of the plasma membrane causes transmission of an orthograde signal from the DHPR (3Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 4Rios E. Brum G.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to this orthograde signal, there is a retrograde signal whereby RyR1 increases the magnitude of the voltage-gated calcium current carried through the DHPR (L-type current, Ref. 7Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Despite a large number of studies involving functional analyses of intact cells and biochemical analyses of cell fractions and isolated proteins, the identity of the protein-protein links necessary for the functional and morphological coupling between DHPRs and RyRs in skeletal muscle remains unresolved. The preceding paper (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) described a new approach in which the fluorescent resonance energy transfer efficiency of a cyan fluorescent protein-yellow fluorescent protein (CFP-YFP) tandem was used as an indirect indicator of sites of possible proximity between the DHPR and RyR. Here we report on another novel approach in which the topology of the plasma membrane/SR junctions is probed by determining whether avidin can access biotin introduced at different sites of the DHPR. The site-specific introduction of biotin was based on the metabolic incorporation that normally occurs only for the small number of cellular enzymes that contain biotin as an essential co-factor. The biotin is incorporated into these enzymes by the catalytic action of biotin protein ligase, with the result that biotin is attached to a lysine contained within a biotin acceptor domain (BAD). In mammalian cells, metabolic biotinylation is effective for fusion proteins containing a minimal BAD (9Parrott M.B. Barry M.A. Mol. Therapy. 2000; 1: 96-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We constructed cDNAs that encoded a 70- or 97-residue BAD fused to sites of the DHPR, as well as a variant of green fluorescent protein (XFP) fused at a second site as an independent reporter of localization. It was then possible to determine whether the BAD had been biotinylated and was accessible for binding of fluorescently labeled avidin. The XFP/BAD/DHPR fusions were found to be functional in EC coupling and to target to discrete foci indicative of membrane junctions. Moreover, effective, metabolic biotinylation occurred for BAD at the N- and C-terminals of the β1a and α1S subunits of the DHPR, as well as at an internal site within the α1S II-III loop. Nearly all of these sites were accessible to avidin, even though the DHPRs were present within fully assembled junctions. In contrast, the C-terminal of α1S was inaccessible to avidin in junctions that contained RyR1, but was accessible in junctions lacking RyR1. Thus, RyR1 appears to occlude access to the C-terminal of α1S but not to the other sites of the DHPR (β1a N- and C-terminals, α1S N-terminal and II-III loop). However, a surprising number of sites within DHPRs localized to fully assembled junctions are accessible to avidin, a molecule of substantial size. Biotin Acceptor Domain—The BAD was extracted from the PinPoint Xa-1 expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) containing the sequence encoding the PSTCD (Propionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase domain). This PinPoint vector encodes a BAD of 123 amino acids in length with an approximate molecular mass of 13 kDa. The crystal structure of this biotin acceptor domain (Protein Data Bank code 1DCZ, Ref. 10Reddy D.V. Shenoy B.C. Carey P.R. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochem. 2000; 39: 2509-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1. The biotinylated lysine is located at position 89 of this sequence (highlighted in yellow). Fig. 2 summarizes the positions at which the BAD was incorporated into the α1S and β1a subunits of the skeletal muscle DHPR. The biotin acceptor domain in these constructs was either 70 or 97 amino acids in length. The cDNAs for the fusion proteins were constructed as follows, with restriction digests and sequencing used for verification.Fig. 2Schematic illustration of the BAD-DHPR fusion constructs. All eight sites of BAD (red circles) attachment are shown although each individual construct contained only one BAD. In the text, the constructs are designated by the site of BAD attachment (e.g. BAD-β1a represents BAD attached to the N-terminal of β1a). To probe the α1S(II-III) loop, either a single fragment α1S construct (top, “α1S(I-II)-BAD-(III-IV)”), or double fragment constructs (“α1S(I-II)-BAD plus α1S(III-IV),” or “α1S(I-II) plus BAD-α1S(III-IV),” middle and bottom, respectively) were used. In all of the II-III loop constructs, α1S residues 672-687 were absent. To probe the α1S C-terminal, BAD was attached either after residue 1860 (“α1Slong-BAD”) or after residue 1667 (“α1SShort-BAD”). In addition to containing a BAD, each construct also contained a fluorescent protein attached to either the N- or C-terminal as an independent reporter of localization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GFP-α1S-BAD—For this and all other C-terminal fusions (except for GFP-BAD, as described later), PCR mutagensis (QuickChange Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce two KpnI restriction sites into the PSTCD sequence of the PinPoint Xa-1 plasmid. One KpnI site was inserted directly before amino acid Glu53 (by inserting GGGGTACCC-5′ to nucleotide G157, where 1 indicates the first nucleotide of the PSTCD coding sequence). The second KpnI site, preceded by a stop codon, was introduced after amino acid Gly122 by inserting TAGGTACCGG-3′ to nucleotide G366. The 219-base pair (bp) fragment yielded by KpnI digestion of this modified PinPoint plasmid was inserted into KpnI-digested GFP-α1Slong and GFP-α1Sshort, which were constructed essentially as described by Papadopoulos et al. (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) for YFP-α1Slong and YFP-α1Sshort. In these two constructs, the rabbit α1S sequence (3Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S.

The GFP-α1Slong or GFP-α1Sshort was connected to the 70-residue BAD via a 4- or 3-residue linker, respectively. XFP-α1S(I-II) BAD—The 219-bp KpnI BAD fragment was ligated to KpnI-digested XFP-α1S(I-II), which was constructed as described in Papadopoulos et al. (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R.

This construct contained residues 1-671 of rabbit α1S (including repeats I and II together with a small portion of the II-III loop). A 2-residue linker connected XFP-α1S(I-II) to the 70-residue BAD. This construct was co-expressed with the plasmid α1S(III-IV) (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

XFP-β1a-BAD—The 219-bp KpnI BAD fragment was ligated to KpnI-digested XFP-β1a (constructed as described in Ref. 8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

BAD-α1S-YFP—To fuse the BAD to the N-terminal of α1S, the Pin-Point Xa-1 plasmid was digested with HindIII and SalI. This BAD sequence codes for residues 26-133 of the original PSTCD sequence. The α1Sshort-YFP plasmid (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

The resulting α1S plasmid and the BAD fragment were co-ligated producing BAD-α1Sshort-YFP with a 16-residue linker connecting the 97-residue BAD to the N-terminal of α1Sshort-YFP. BAD-β1a-YFP—The β1a-YFP plasmid (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol.

A 369-bp BAD fragment (encoding residues 23-133) was isolated from BAD-α1Sshort-YFP with EcoRI and NheI. The opened β1a plasmid and the BAD fragment were co-ligated producing BAD-β1a-YFP. A 13-residue linker connected the 97-residue BAD to the N-terminal of β1a-YFP. BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP—A 347-bp BAD fragment (encoding BAD residues 26-128) was isolated from BAD-α1Sshort-YFP by restriction cuts with SacI and NheI. The plasmid α1S(III-IV)-YFP (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was digested with SacI and NheI, opening the plasmid before the N-terminal of α1S repeat III, and the BAD cDNA was inserted into this site. A 6-residue linker connected the 97-residue BAD to the N-terminal of α1S(III-IV)-YFP. This construct was co-expressed with the plasmid α1S(I-II) (8Papadopoulos S. Leuranger V. Bannister R. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44046-44056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). α1S(I-II)-BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP—This fusion construct encodes α1S residues 1-671, BAD residues 26-128, α1S residues 686-1860, and then the coding sequence for YFP. The plasmid was made by first opening the BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP plasmid (see above) with NheI and BglII at the multiple cloning region preceding the α1S coding sequence. The α1S(I-II) coding sequence was isolated from a α1S(I-II) plasmid by restriction cuts with NheI and BamHI. These two fragments were co-ligated to obtain α1S(I-II)-BAD-(III-IV)-YFP. A 14-residue linker connected α1S(I-II) to the 79-residue BAD, which was connected via a 6-residue linker to α1S(III-IV)-YFP. GFP-BAD—Using PCR mutagenesis, a KpnI restriction site was introduced into the PSTCD sequence of the PinPoint Xa-1 plasmid directly before amino acid Glu53 (by inserting GGGGTACC-5′ to nucleotide G157). A stop codon followed by a KpnI site was introduced after amino acid Gly122 by inserting TAGGTACCGG-3′ to nucleotide G366. The modified plasmid was digested with KpnI, and the 218-bp fragment was inserted into the KpnI-cut multiple cloning site of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences). A 17-residue linker connected the 70-residue BAD to the C-terminal of GFP. Primary cultures of myotubes isolated from newborn dysgenic, dyspedic, or β1-null mice were prepared as described previously (11Beam K.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 283-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myoblasts were plated on ECL-coated (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) 35-mm plastic culture dishes or dishes with glass coverslip bottoms (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and grown for 6-7 days in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Approximately 1 week after plating, myotubes were microinjected (12Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 320: 134-139Crossref Scopus (577) Google Scholar) in a single nucleus with one of the above cDNA constructs (5-100 ng/μl). After injection, the cells were changed into a culture medium containing normal levels of biotin (1 μm). For Western blot analyses, immortal dysgenic myotubes were transfected with cDNA constructs using LT-1 transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI). Contractions were elicited by 10-ms, 55-100 V stimulus applied via an extracellular pipette placed near intact myotubes expressing constructs of interest. Images of these myotubes were acquired at a rate of 40-50 Hz. The contractions were quantified by measuring the movement of an identifiable portion of a myotube across the visual field. Two days after injection, myotubes were washed in PBS (calciumand magnesium-free), and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min and incubated in PBS blocking solution for 1 h. The cells were then exposed to NeutrAvidin-tetramethylrhodamine (here after referred to as “avidin”; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or streptavidin-Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (1:2000-1:5000) in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS blocking solution for 1 h in the dark. The cells were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by PBS. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels (4-20% precast Tris-HCl; Bio-Rad) in a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose using a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 h. Blots for GFP detection were blocked in 3% milk, PBS and exposed to monoclonal GFP antibody (1:1,000 in 3% milk/PBS) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at room temperature. The blot was washed with 0.1% Tween 20, PBS and then incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 in 3% milk/PBS) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 30 min. Blots for biotin detection were blocked using Startingblock (Pierce), and then incubated with streptavidin-poly-HRP (Pierce), diluted (1:10,000 in Poly-HRP Dilution buffer, Pierce) for 30 min. Both GFP and biotin detection blots were then washed with 0.1% Tween 20, PBS. Blots were developed with Super Signal West Femto detection kit (Pierce). Fluorescence was analyzed using an Axiovert/LSM 510 META laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Excitation and emission parameters for each fluorophore were set as follows: CFP, excitation at 458 and 458 nm dichroic, and emission using a 465-495-nm band pass filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT); GFP, excitation at 488 and 488/543 nm dual dichroic, and emission with a 505-530-nm band pass filter; YFP, excitation 488 and 488/543 nm dual dichroic, and emission with a 505-530-nm band pass filter (to allow separation from rhodamine fluorescence); rhodamine, excitation with 543 and 488/543 nm dual dichroic and emission with a 560-nm long pass filter. Cells were viewed with a ×40 (1.3 NA) or ×63 (1.4 NA) oil immersion objective. As a tool for probing the supramolecular architecture of DHPRs and RyRs assembled into plasma membrane/SR junctions, we introduced a BAD at different sites of the DHPR (Fig. 2) to determine whether a 60-kDa avidin molecule could access those sites. BAD fusion proteins were expressed in myotubes from dysgenic mice (lacking functional α1S channels), dyspedic mice (lacking RyR1), or β1-null mice (lacking β1 subunits), which were cultured in the presence of normal biotin levels (1 μm). Previous studies have shown that a shortened 70-amino acid PSTCD is sufficient for endogenous enzymatic biotinylation in mammalian cells (9Parrott M.B. Barry M.A. Mol. Therapy. 2000; 1: 96-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and our fusion constructs included BADs of either 70 or 97 residues in length. As a test for endogenous biotinylation activity, we overexpressed a GFPBAD fusion protein in dysgenic myotubes. The presence of biotinylated proteins was then assayed by fixing and permeabilizing the cells, exposing them to streptavidin-Cy3, and imaging with confocal microscopy. Cells displaying strong green fluorescence also displayed bright red fluorescence (Fig. 3), whereas cells without detectable green fluorescence showed only a low level of background, red fluorescence (not shown). Additionally, within cells expressing GFP-BAD, there was a strong correlation between the regions displaying higher intensities of green and those displaying higher intensities of red fluorescence (Fig. 3), with one important exception. Specifically, the nuclei displayed stronger GFP fluorescence than Cy3 fluorescence, indicating that streptavidin-Cy3 has restricted access to the inside of nuclei. As a second confirmation of endogenous biotinylation, Western blot analysis of GFP-BAD expression in transiently transfected immortal dysgenic myotubes showed a ∼37-kDa biotinylated protein when probed with anti-GFP antibody or streptavidin-Poly-HRP (Fig. 3). Thus, histochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that the metabolic biotinylation pathway in myotubes is able to effectively biotinylate the BAD fusion proteins. Previous studies have shown that α1S and β1a subunits contained in junctionally targeted DHPRs are clustered in punctate foci, typically near the cell surface (13Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Such punctate foci of XFP fluorescence were observed for all of the constructs examined here in which XFP and BAD were fused to sites of α1S or β1a (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Moreover, all of these constructs were able to support EC coupling, as indicated by electrically evoked contractions. In particular, evoked contractions were observed (Fig. 4) in both β1-null myotubes expressing XFP-β1a-BAD (14/21 cells) and BAD-β1a-YFP (16/21) and in dysgenic myotubes expressing BAD-α1S-YFP (20/28), XFP-α1S(I-II)-BAD + α1S(III-IV) (36/45), α1S(I-II) + BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP (14/27), α1S(I-II)-BAD-(III-IV)-YFP (42/52), GFP-α1Slong-BAD (37/39), and GFP-α1Sshort-BAD (20/27). Moreover, these same constructs mediated Ca2+ currents that did not differ dramatically from those of the wild-type constructs expressed in myotubes (14Haarmann C.S. Lorenzon N.M. Papadopoulos S. Beam K.G. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 219aGoogle Scholar). Thus, the incorporation of a BAD did not appear to interfere with the targeting or essential function of the α1S or β1a fusion proteins.Fig. 6The N-terminal of β1a is biotinylated and accessible to avidin within fully assembled junctions.

A complete lack of biotinylation did not appear to be responsible for the absence of punctuate avidin-rhodamine staining. In particular, there was a similar pattern of diffuse fluorescence for GFP and avidin-rhodamine in regions of highly expressed protein not yet in junctions (arrows).

Vertical scale, arbitrary units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 5 illustrates confocal fluorescent images from a dysgenic myotube in which YFP-β1a-BAD was co-expressed with unlabeled α1S. Because β1a is freely diffusible in the absence of α1S, the presence of yellow fluorescent foci is consistent with junctional targeting of DHPRs containing both the unlabeled α1S and YFP-β1a-BAD. To determine whether BAD on the C-terminal had been biotinylated and was accessible to avidin, myotubes were fixed, permeabilized, and then exposed to avidinrhodamine. Fig. 5 shows that red fluorescent foci were both present and co-localized with the yellow foci, as was observed in 28/35 dysgenic myotubes examined. A similar pattern of colocalizing red and yellow foci was also present when XFP-β1a-BAD was expressed in β1-null myotubes (9/9 cells). Thus, a large avidin molecule has access to a site located very near to the C-terminal of β1a. In endogenous biotin-containing proteins, the BAD is usually located near the C-terminal. Nonetheless, effective biotinylation was achieved when a BAD was fused to the N-terminal of the β1a subunit, as is indicated by the occurrence of co-localizing red and yellow fluorescent puncta in β1-null myotubes expressing BAD-β1a-YFP (Fig. 6; 18/18 cells) and in dysgenic myotubes co-expressing both BAD-β1a-YFP and unlabeled α1S (12/12 cells). Moreover, coincident red and yellow foci were also observed in dysgenic myotubes expressing BAD-α1S-YFP (Fig. 7; 19/19 cells). Thus, avidin has access to sites near both the N- and C-terminals of β1a and the N-terminal of α1S within fully assembled junctions. An important goal of the present work was to probe the environment of the α1S(II-III) cytoplasmic loop. Because the results described above showed that either N- or C-terminal BAD could be effectively biotinylated, the initial approach was to separate α1S into two fragments (one containing repeats I-II with the proximal portion of the loop and the other containing the distal portion of the loop together with repeats III-IV). These constructs allowed attachment of a BAD to either the C-terminal (residue 671) of the proximal II-III loop, “XFP-α1S(I-II)-BAD,” or the N-terminal (residue 686) of the distal II-III loop, “BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP” (residues 672-685 were omitted). These BAD containing constructs were then expressed with the appropriate complementary fragment: α1S(III-IV) (in some instances N-terminal tagged with YFP) or α1S(I-II), respectively. Previous studies have shown that two fragment constructs of α1S (without a BAD) are able to restore EC coupling in dysgenic myotubes (15Ahern C.A. Arikkath J. Vallejo P. Gurnett C.A. Powers P.A.

A. 2002; 99: 10167-10172Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Indeed, co-expression of either YFP-α1S(I-II)-BAD + α1S(III-IV), or α1S(I-II) + BAD-α1S(III-IV)-YFP, in dysgenic myotubes resulted in restoration of EC coupling (see above) and the appearance of yellow punctate foci (Fig. 8, A and B), indicating that the BAD-tagged fragments were correctly targeted to junctions.

https://openalex.org/W2066119162,"X-linked ectodermal dysplasia receptor (XEDAR) is a recently isolated member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that is highly expressed during embryonic development and binds to ectodysplasin-A2 (EDA-A2). In this report, we demonstrate that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless induces apoptosis in an EDA-A2-dependent fashion. The apoptosis-inducing ability of XEDAR is dependent on the activation of caspase 8 and can be blocked by its genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. Although XEDAR-induced apoptosis can be blocked by dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and FADD small interfering RNA, XEDAR does not directly bind to FADD, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, or RIP1. Instead, XEDAR signaling leads to the formation of a secondary complex containing FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10, which results in caspase activation. Thus, XEDAR belongs to a novel class of death receptors that lack a discernible death domain but are capable of activating apoptosis in a caspase 8- and FADD-dependent fashion. XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolution of death receptors prior to the emergence of the death domain and may play a role in the induction of apoptosis during embryonic development and adult life.

The apoptosis-inducing ability of these receptors has been mapped to a conserved cytoplasmic domain of 60–80 amino acids called the death domain (DD) (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J.

TNFR1 is the prototypical and perhaps the best characterized death receptor (4Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that ligand-induced trimerization of TNFR1 leads to the recruitment of DD-containing adaptor protein TRADD to a plasma membrane-bound complex (complex I) (5Micheau O.

Assembly of complex I occurs in lipid rafts and leads to NF-κB activation via RIP1-mediated recruitment of the IκB kinase complex, whereas JNK is activated via TRAF2-mediated activation of MAP3 kinase (5Micheau O.

Subsequently, TRADD and RIP1 dissociate from complex I and associate with a cytoplasmic complex (complex II) consisting of DD-containing protein FADD and procaspase 8, the apical caspase of the caspase cascade (5Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Under conditions favoring TNFR1-induced apoptosis, procaspase 8 is activated upon recruitment to complex II and subsequently results in the activation of downstream caspases, such as caspase 3, 6, and 7, and eventual cell death (5Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Unlike TNFR1, signaling via Fas, DR4, and DR5 delivers a strong and rapid proapoptotic signal (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Ectodysplasin A is a distantly related ligand of the TNF family that plays a key role in ectodermal differentiation (11Mikkola M.L. Thesleff I. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mutations in the ectodysplasin gene (Eda) cause X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which is characterized by the absence or deficient function of hair, teeth, and sweat glands (12Pinheiro M.

Several alternatively spliced transcripts of EDA have been identified (14Srivastava A.K. Pispa J. Hartung A.J. Du Y. Ezer S. Jenks T. Shimada T. Pekkanen M. Mikkola M.L. Ko M.S. Thesleff I. Kere J.

The two predominant splice variants, EDA-A1 and EDA-A2, differ from each other by a 2-amino acid motif and bind to distinct receptors (17Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, EDA-A1 binds to a TNF family receptor designated EDAR, whereas EDA-A2 binds to the related receptor, XEDAR (17Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J. Goddard A. de Vos A.M. Gao W.Q. Dixit V.M. Science. 2000; 290: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Transgenic expression of a secreted form of EDA-A2 resulted in thin and listless animals, which died within 1 month of birth (18Newton K. French D.M. Yan M. Frantz G.D. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Histological examination of EDA-A2-transgenic animals exhibited multifocal myodegeneration (18Newton K. French D.M. Yan M. Frantz G.D. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1608-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The downstream events culminating in EDA-A2-induced myodegeneration and early lethality are unclear at present. Unlike most TNFR family receptors, XEDAR is a type III transmembrane protein (lacking an NH2-terminal signal peptide) that bears 32% sequence homology with EDAR in the extracellular ligand-binding domain (17Yan M.

However, XEDAR possesses a unique intracellular region with no significant homology to other TNFRs. Two predominant alternatively spliced isoforms of XEDAR have been described, XEDAR-s and XEDAR-L, which differ from each other by the presence of a 21-amino acid linker in the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both XEDAR isoforms lack a death domain and have been shown to signal mainly via TRAF6 and TRAF3 to activate the NF-κB and JNK pathways (17Yan M. Wang L.C. Hymowitz S.G. Schilbach S. Lee J.

In this study, we report that although XEDAR lacks a death domain, it nevertheless possesses the ability to induce programmed cell death. Unlike Fas and the TRAIL receptors, XEDAR does not directly bind to the death adaptors FADD, TRADD, or RIP but activates caspase 8 via the formation of a complex containing FADD, caspase 8, and caspase 10. Our results suggest that XEDAR may represent an early stage in the evolutionary history of death receptors and may play a role in the mediation of apoptosis during development and in adult life.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RIP, TRAF1, TRAF3, TRAF6, and β-actin and goat polyclonal antibodies against FADD, RICK, caspase 8, and TRADD were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against caspase 8, cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and BID were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). FLAG and control mouse IgG beads, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2)-horseradish peroxidase, and tubulin were obtained from Sigma. Caspase assay substrates DEVD-AFC, IETD-AFC, and LEHD-AFC and cell-permeable caspase inhibitors and were purchased from Enzyme Systems and Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human EDA-A2 and TNFα were obtained from R&D Systems and also generated in SF9 cells as described earlier (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). XEDAR-Fc and EDAR-Fc were generated as described previously (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I.

(Rocky Hill, NJ). Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—For studying in vivo interactions, 5 × 107 293F-XEDAR-L cells were treated with control supernatant or EDA-A2 for 10 min. Cells were subsequently lysed in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 EDTA-free mini-protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were precleared with mouse IgG beads and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of FLAG beads precoated with a supersaturated casein solution. Beads were washed twice with buffer A, once with a high salt wash buffer (buffer A + 500 mm NaCl), and again with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by Western blot. Co-immunoprecipitation of caspase 8 complex was performed using 2 μg of an anticaspase 8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and essentially was as described previously (5Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Caspase Activation Assay—293F-XEDAR-L cells were left untreated (control) or treated with EDA-A2 or TRAIL (50 ng/ml) for different time intervals and subsequently lysed in buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% CHAPS). Caspase activity was measured in a 100-μl reaction volume containing cell lysate (20 μg of total protein) and 5 μm AFC-coupled peptide substrates in buffer D (buffer C containing 100 mm NaCl). The reaction was followed at 37 °C by SpectraFluor using 400 nm excitation and 510-nm emission filters. Caspase activities were estimated by measuring the turnover of substrates DEVD-AFC (caspase 3), IETD-AFC (caspase 8), and LEHD-AFC (caspase 9) (Enzyme Systems). Apoptosis Assays—Cells (1.5–3 × 105) were transfected with the empty vector, XEDAR, TNFR1, or Fas (500 ng) along with β-lactosidase- and green fluorescent protein-encoding plasmids (75 ng each) using calcium phosphate (293T and 293F) or LipofectAMINE (L-929 cells). Cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope and photographed 36 h after transfection or were stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (21Eby M.T. Jasmin A. Kumar A. Sharma K. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15336-15342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase-positive cells were counted for viable and apoptotic cells based on their morphology. For all ligand-induced cell death experiments, stable cells expressing XEDAR were treated with EDA-A2 or TRAIL for 12 h and then stained with Hoechst 33342 and/or YOPRO-1. Cells were visualized by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Approximately 300 cells were counted for each treatment (n = 3) from three randomly selected fields, and the mean was used to calculate the percentage of apoptosis. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Cell-permeable synthetic caspase inhibitors Boc-D-fmk, zVAD-fmk, zDEVD-fmk, zVDVAD-fmk, zVEID-fmk, zIETD-fmk, and zLEHD-fmk were dissolved in ME2SO and added to the cells just before treatment with the ligand. ME2SO was added to the control wells to the same final concentration. For experiments testing the involvement of TNFα/TNFR1 in EDA-A2-induced apoptosis, TNFα, TNFR1-Fc, and a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against TNFα were used at concentrations of 10 ng/ml, 0.2 μg/ml, and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. Preparation and Transfection of siRNA—siRNA oligonucleotides with two thymidine residues (dTdT) at the 3′-end of the sequence were designed against caspase 8 (sense, 5′-GCAAGAACCCAUCAAGGAUd-TdT-3′), FADD-1 (sense, 5′-CGUCAUAUGUGAUAAUGUGdTdT-3′), FADD-2 (sense, 5′-CCGAGCUCAAGUUCCUAUGdTdT-3′), TRADD (sense, 5′-AACUCCACUUGGCCUAUCUdTdT-3′), mouse TRADD (control) (sense, 5′-UAUACAAGGCUCUGCAGACdTdT-3′), and lamin A/C (sense, 5′-CUGGACUUCCAGAAGAACAdTdT-3′) along with their corresponding antisense oligonucleotides. 293FLAG-XEDAR cells were transfected with 80 nm double-stranded RNA using calcium phosphate in each well of a 6-well plate and replated into wells of a 24-well plate 24 h posttransfection. 48–60 h posttransfection cells were treated with EDA-A2 or TRAIL (50 ng/ml) for another 12 h. An untreated replicate from each set was analyzed by Western blotting to confirm the down-regulation of the protein targeted by siRNAs. Recombinant EDA-A2 Induces Apoptosis in 293F Cells Expressing XEDAR—To facilitate the characterization of XEDAR signaling, we recently generated a subclone of 293F (human embryonic kidney), designated 293FLAG-XEDAR, with stable expression of the NH2-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged XE-DAR-L isoform (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These cells were generated using retrovirally mediated gene transfer and show modest expression of XEDAR as determined by cell surface staining with an antibody against the FLAG tag. While studying the ability of EDA-A2 to induce the NF-κB pathway in these cells, we were surprised to find that a large number of cells were undergoing cell death (Fig. 1A). EDA-A2-treated cells demonstrated typical features of apoptosis, such as cell rounding, detachment, and fragmentation into small apoptotic bodies (Fig. 1A, top). They also readily stained with YOPRO-1, a cell-impermeable nuclear dye that stains only those cells that have lost membrane integrity (Fig. 1A, middle) (22Idziorek T. Estaquier J. De Bels F. Ameisen J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nuclear staining with YOPRO-1 and Hoechst 33342 dyes showed that the nuclei of EDA-A2-treated cells were condensed and fragmented, another characteristic of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1A, inset). We confirmed the apoptosis-inducing ability of EDA-A2 using several independent preparations of this protein prepared in our laboratory as well as a commercially available preparation (R&D Systems) (not shown). The cytotoxicity of EDA-A2 was specific for XEDAR-expressing cells as it had no effect on parental 293 cells or those infected with a control retroviral vector (not shown). Furthermore, EDA-A2-induced cell death could be specifically blocked by soluble XEDAR (XEDAR-Fc), whereas soluble EDAR (EDAR-Fc) was without any inhibitory effect (Fig. 1C). EDA-A2 also induced apoptosis in a stable clone of HeLa cells expressing XEDAR, although these cells required sensitization with actinomycin-D (Fig. 1B). It has been reported that the cytotoxic effects of TNFR2, CD40, and CD30 are mediated by the endogenous production of TNFα, which activates TNFR1 in an autotropic or paratropic fashion (23Grell M. Zimmermann G. Gottfried E. Chen C.M. Grunwald U. Huang D.C. Wu Lee Y.H. Durkop H. Engelmann H. Scheurich P. Wajant H. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3034-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine the role of TNFα/TNFR1 signaling in the induction of apoptosis by EDA-A2. Unlike EDA-A2, treatment of 293FLAG-XEDAR cells with TNFα (in the absence of actinomycin-D) failed to induce significant apoptosis, thereby arguing against the possibility that EDA-A2 induces apoptosis via the production of endogenous TNFα (Fig. 1D). More importantly, blockage of TNFα/TNFR1 signaling by the use of soluble TNFR1 receptor (TNFR1-Fc) or a neutralizing antibody against TNFα had no significant effect on apoptosis induced by EDA-A2, while successfully blocking apoptosis induced by combined treatment with TNFα and actinomycin-D (Fig. 1, E and F). Taken together, the above results demonstrate that EDA-A2-induced apoptosis is not mediated via the production of TNFα and resultant signaling via TNFR1. Induction of Apoptosis by XEDAR—Unlike the classical death receptors, XEDAR does not possess a death domain, and therefore, the ability of EDA-A2 to induce apoptosis in XEDAR-expressing cells was unexpected. Signaling via the receptors of the TNFR family can be activated in a ligand-independent fashion by overexpression-induced receptor aggregation (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether overexpression of XEDAR by itself would induce apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, transient transfection of plasmids encoding full-length XEDAR-L or XEDAR-s isoforms (19Sinha S.K. Zachariah S. Quinones H.I. Shindo M. Chaudhary P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44953-44961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but not a carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (N172), in 293T cells led to cellular rounding, condensation detachment, and fragmentation into apoptotic bodies, features suggestive of cell death. We obtained essentially similar results upon transient transfection of XEDAR in mouse L-929 cells (Fig. 2D). Activation of Extrinsic Caspase Pathway during EDA-A2-induced Apoptosis—The presence of nuclear fragmentation during EDA-A2-induced apoptosis pointed toward the involvement of caspases. Therefore, to test whether caspase activation is involved in XEDAR-induced apoptosis, we treated 293FLAG-XEDAR cells with EDA-A2 and TRAIL (positive control) and analyzed the cell lysates for cleavage of various caspases known to be involved in the induction of apoptosis. We readily detected cleavage of caspase 8 into p43, p41, and p18 fragments within 8 h of EDA-A2 treatment, although weak cleavage was evident within 4 h (Fig. 3A). Caspase 3 is one of the executioner caspases of the caspase cascade and is activated by caspase 8 during apoptosis induced by the death receptors. We detected significant cleavage of caspase 3 into its active fragments, p19 and p17, following EDA-A2 treatment (Fig. 3A). EDA-A2 treatment also led to the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, one of the caspase 3 substrates, indicating caspase 3 activation (Fig. 3A). We confirmed activation of caspase 8 and 3 in the lysates of EDA-A2-treated cells using their synthetic peptide substrates coupled with a fluorogen AFC (Fig. 3, B and C). Activation of Intrinsic (Mitochondrial) Caspase Pathway during EDA-A2-induced Apoptosis—BID is a proapoptotic member of the bcl2 family that is cleaved by caspase 8 during apoptosis induced by death domain-containing receptors of the TNFR family (24Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar, 25Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3079) Google Scholar). Truncated BID (tBID) then translocates to the mitochondria, where it induces release of cytochrome c into cytosol and subsequent activation of caspase 9. As shown in Fig. 4A, a cleaved fragment of BID (p15) appeared as early as 4 h after EDA-A2 treatment and correlated with the appearance of the cleaved fragments (p37/35) of caspase 9. Activation of caspase 9 following EDA-A2 treatment was further confirmed using a fluorogenic assay based on the cleavage of its synthetic peptide substrate (Fig. 4B). Treatment with EDA-A2 also resulted in the release of cytochrome c and Smac from the mitochondria into the cytosol (Fig. 4C). TRAIL was used as a positive control for the above experiments. Taken together, the above results demonstrate activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic cell pathways of caspase activation following EDA-A2 treatment. Caspase Activation Is Required for EDA-A2-induced Apoptosis—We next sought to determine whether caspases are functionally involved in EDA-A2-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig 5A, Boc-D-fmk and zVAD-fmk, two broad spectrum synthetic cell-permeable caspase inhibitors, effectively blocked EDA-A2-induced cell death. zIETD-fmk, a preferential inhibitor of caspase 8, was similarly very effective in blocking EDA-A2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A). In contrast, preferential inhibitors of caspase 3 (zDEVD-fmk) and caspase 9 (zLEHD-fmk) had only a partial inhibitory effect, whereas preferential inhibitors of caspase 2 (zVDVAD-fmk) and caspase 6 (zVEID-fmk) failed to significantly block EDA-A2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A). Finally, crmA, a cowpox virus-encoded preferential inhibitor of caspase 8 (26Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), also effectively blocked EDA-A2-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Caspase 8 Is Essential for EDA-A2-induced Apoptosis—We further analyzed the contribution of caspase 8 to XEDAR-induced apoptosis by using its dominant-negative mutant (caspase 8 C360S) and cFLIPL/MRITα1, a naturally occurring cytoplasmic inhibitor of caspase 8 (27Han D.K. Chaudhary P.M. Wright M.E. Friedman C. Trask B.J. Riedel R.T. Baskin D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hood L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11333-11338Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5C, both caspase 8 C360S mutant and cFLIPL/MRITα1 blocked XEDAR-induced apoptosis with efficiency comparable with that against Fas, a receptor known to use caspase 8 for induction of cell death. EDA-A2-induced apoptosis was also effectively blocked by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caspase 8 expression. In fact, caspase 8 siRNA blocked cell death induced by EDA-A2 with efficiency comparable with that against TRAIL, a TNF family ligand known to require caspase 8 for the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5, D–F). Interestingly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caspase 8 expression led to complete inhibition of caspase 3 activation, thereby demonstrating that activation of caspase 8 is required for activation of caspase 3 following EDA-A2 treatment (Fig. 5, G and H). Taken together, the above results establish caspase 8 as the apical caspase in EDA-A2/XEDAR-induced apoptosis and demonstrate that it plays a non-redundant and indispensable role in this process. Role of FADD in EDA-A2-induced Apoptosis—FADD is a common mediator of cell death induced by the classical death domain-containing receptors of the TNFR family and is recruited to them either directly or via the intermediate adaptor protein TRADD (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5152) Google Scholar, 8Peter M.E. Krammer P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We checked the involvement of FADD in XEDAR-induced cell death by using a dominant-negative mutant of FADD (DN-FADD) that lacks its death effector domain (29Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of DN-FADD blocked XEDAR-induced cell death in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6A). However, dominant-negative FADD was slightly less effective in blocking cell death induced by EDA-A2 as compared with that induced by TRAIL (Fig. 6A). We used two different siRNAs directed against FADD to confirm its involvement in EDA-A2-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, we observed significant inhibition of apoptosis upon EDA-A2 treatment in cells in which FADD expression had been silenced using either of the two siRNAs. In contrast a siRNA directed against lamin A/C failed"

Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). It is a leucine-rich repeat protein, with a high content of cysteine residues and a three-dimensional structure that resembles a horseshoe (3Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It avidly binds (with few exceptions, see below) the extracellular RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily (4Beintema J.J. Schuller C. Irie M. Carsana A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 51: 165-192Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and inhibits their enzymatic activity.The physiological role of cRI has not been ascertained conclusively. It has been proposed that cRI could regulate cellular RNA levels or modulate RNases with a specific biological action, e.g. angiogenins, or protect cellular RNAs from extracellular RNases (2Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar).This last hypothesis, that cRI protects against foreign RNases, has recently received increasing consensus based on the following observations. Cytotoxic RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily, namely onconase from amphibia and bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase), are resistant to the inhibitory action of cRI (5Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 491-514Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, non-cytotoxic RNases with high affinity for cRI, such as bovine (RNase A) or human (HP-RNase) pancreatic RNases, or monomerized BS-RNase, become cytotoxic when engineered through directed mutagenesis into RNases with a decreased affinity for cRI (6Antignani A.

Cytotoxic, dimeric BS-RNase, which is completely resistant to cRI inhibition, loses its cytotoxicity when it is dissociated into stable, active monomers, which are cRI-sensitive (9Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that cells manipulated to increase their cRI levels become more resistant to RNase cytotoxicity (11Haigis M.C. Kurten E.L. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).However, the results of other investigations cast doubt on the conclusion that the cytotoxic action of an RNase depends, mainly or exclusively, on its ability to evade the neutralizing action of cRI and that the physiological role of cRI is to protect cells from extra-cellular RNases. Cases have been reported of RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily that have been engineered into cytotoxic RNase variants, yet are inhibited by cRI (12Bosch M. Benito A. Ribo M. Puig T. Beaumelle B. Vilanova M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Newton D.L. Xue Y. Boque L. Wlodawer A. Kung H.F. Rybak S.M. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has been reported that when RNase A is dimerized through lyophilization from acetic acid solutions, it acquires cytotoxic properties (14Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but it maintains its high affinity for cRI (15Sorrentino S. Barone R. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Thus, it seemed of interest to investigate the role of cRI in RNase cytotoxicity by suppressing cellular cRI through the silencing of the mRNA transcribed from the cRI gene. This technology, based on the phenomenon of RNA interference (16Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar), involves the use, or the intracellular production by DNA engineering (17Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y.

The results of this investigation indicate that the cytosolic inhibitor may not be a guardian against foreign RNases in general, as it only affects those foreign RNases that are intrinsically cytotoxic but not those that are non-cytotoxic.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—BS-RNase (18D'Alessio G.

Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and the Klenow fragment DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Primm (Milano, Italy). DNA sequences were obtained from MWG Biotec (Ebersberg, Germany). Plasmid pBSU6 was from Ambion (Austin, TX). Plasmid pEGFP was from Invitrogen.The Plasmid Encoding cRI-silencing RNA—The sequence of nucleotides 430–449 of the cRI gene (GenBank™ accession number M22414) was used to produce a siRNA directed to cRI mRNA. The chosen sequence was analyzed by a BLAST search and found to be unique to the cRI gene. The sequence was selected for its high GC content (66%) and its position at more than 100 bases downstream to the AUG (16Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8081) Google Scholar, 17Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar el B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Upon cloning, the G doublet at the 5′-end of the sequence contributed to the GGG triplet required for transcription initiation.The pBSU6 plasmid, bearing an ApaI site downstream to the polymerase III U6 promoter, was digested with ApaI and treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase to remove the protruding nucleotides at the 3′-end and generate blunt ends. The plasmid was then digested with HindIII. Oligonucleotide 1a (5′-GGTCCTGTCCAGCACACTACA-3′) was synthesized with the sequence selected from the cRI gene described above and an extra A nucleotide at its 3′-end for construction of a HindIII site. Oligonucleotide 1a was annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide 1b (5′-AGCTTGTAGTGTGCTGGACAGGACC-3′), carrying an HindIII sequence at its 5′-end and ligated with T4 ligase to the HindIII-digested pBSU6 plasmid.Through the screening by sequence analyses of transformed Escherichia coli JM101 cells (New England Biolabs), a positive clone was selected, digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligated to a double-stranded DNA fragment made up of complementary oligonucleotides 2a (5′-AGCTTGTAGTGTGCTGGACAGGACCCTTTTTG-3′) and 2b (5′-AATTCAAAAAGGGTCCTGTCCAGCACACTACA-3), containing the target sequence from the cRI gene flanked by HindIII and EcoRI sites. The resulting recombinant plasmid, termed pBSU6-cRI, was used for transforming E. coli JM101 cells. Restriction analyses of the plasmid confirmed the correctness of the final construct, in which complementary sequences 1a and 2a generate upon transcription the double-stranded siRNA for cRI silencing.HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid pBSU6-cRI to obtain transient transformants. To obtain stable transformants the neomycin resistance gene was inserted into the BamHI site of pBSU6-cRI using the pGFP plasmid as a source. E. coli JM101 cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid (termed pU6-cRI-neor) and plated on LB agar containing kanamycin. Recombinant colonies were identified by restriction analyses to confirm the insertion of the designed fragment and correctness of orientation.Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared as described (21Bracale A. Castaldi F. Nitsch L. D'Alessio G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1980-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Proteins were then transferred onto PVDF membranes and tested with the appropriate antibody. An anti-cRI rabbit antiserum (Ig-Tech, Perdifumo, Salerno, Italy) was used at a 1/3,000 dilution. The anti-glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Ambion) was used at a 1/10,000 dilution. Secondary antibodies were from Pierce and used at a 1/20,000 dilution. Detection was performed with the peroxidase-based Super Signal West-Pico procedure (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Culture and Transfections—HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells (1 × 105/well), grown in 6-well plates, were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer's instructions. To select stably transfected clones, cells were treated 48 h after transfection with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen).Cytotoxicity Assays—HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2.5 × 104/well), grown for 24 h, and transfected with pBSU6-cRI. After additional 24 h, RNases were added to the cell cultures. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in growth medium, and counted. Cell survival was determined as the percentage of survived cells with respect to non-treated cells. Stably transfected HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 × 103/well) in the presence or absence of RNases under test. After 48 h, cell counts were determined as described above.RT-PCR—Transfected HeLa cells (see above) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with TriReagent (Sigma) to isolate total RNA as described by the manufacturer. The Access RT-PCR System (Promega) was used with 200 ng of total RNA. Primers are listed in the legend to Fig. 1. The PCR reaction was performed in a PerkinElmer-Life Sciences DNA thermal cycler as follows: 1 cycle at 48 °C for 45 min for the reverse transcription followed by 2 min at 94 °C; 40 cycles, each including: 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 68 °C. After the last cycle, samples were kept for 7 min at 68 °C and then stored at 4 °C. Amplified samples were analyzed on agarose gels.RESULTSHeLa cells were transfected with plasmid pBSU6-cRI, containing the DNA template encoding siRNA designed to silence cRI mRNA. The effects of transfection were analyzed at the RNA and protein levels (Fig. 1). Total RNA was used for RT-PCR, with actin mRNA to standardize the procedure; primers are listed in the legend to Fig. 1. Complete inhibition of the expression of the cRI gene was observed 48 h after transfection (Fig. 1A). The cRI protein level was measured with an anti-cRI antibody; GAPDH, measured with an anti-GAPDH antibody, was used as an internal standard. Complete silencing of the cRI protein was obtained at 48 h after transfection (see Fig. 1B).These results indicate that transfection of HeLa cells with plasmid pBSU6-cRI, which express a dsRNA complementary to a segment of cRI mRNA, is so effective in silencing cRI gene expression that its transcription and translation products are undetectable.We then tested the effects of cytotoxic RNases on the growth of HeLa cells in which the cRI gene was silenced. The RNases to be tested were: BS-RNase and onconase, natural cytotoxins fully resistant to cRI; RNase A and HP-RNase, inactive as cytotoxins and with high affinity for cRI; RE-HP-RNase, an HP-RNase variant engineered to be cytotoxic and partially evasive to cRI inhibition.RNase A and HP-RNase are inactive as cytotoxins either toward wild-type or HeLa-cRI– cells (cRI-silenced HeLa cells) (Fig. 2). Analogous results were obtained with onconase, a highly cytotoxic RNase. With the less cytotoxic enzymes, BS-RNase and RE-HP-RNase, increased cytotoxicity was observed when they were tested on HeLa-cRI– cells compared with wild-type HeLa cells. For BS-RNase, the values of IC50 (the RNase concentration that kills 50% of tested cells) were found to be 100 ± 7 μg/ml on wild-type HeLa cells and 13 ± 4 μg/ml on HeLa-cRI– cells. The IC50 of RE-HP-RNase changed from »100 μg/ml on wild-type HeLa cells to 23 ± 4 μg/ml on HeLa-cRI–.Fig. 2Cytotoxic effects of RNases on wild-type HeLa cells (A) and HeLa cells – cRI–, i.e. deprived of cRI (B). The RNases were as follows: RNase A (□), HP-RNase (▵), RE-HP-RNase (▴), BS-RNase (•), and onconase (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results indicate that cytotoxic RNases, such as BS-RNase and RE-HP-RNase, display a more powerful cytotoxic effect on cells deprived of cRI. Notwithstanding, the absence of cRI in HeLa cells does not allow a non-cytotoxic RNase, such as RNase A or HP-RNase, to become cytotoxic. Onconase, strongly cytotoxic under the assay conditions, has the same IC50 value on wild-type HeLa as on HeLa-cRI– cells.Additional analyses were carried out on stably transfected HeLa cells with a longer RNase treatment (48 h), which allowed a closer evaluation of the cytotoxicity of less cytotoxic RNases. Isolated, stably transfected clones were selected on the basis of the absence in lysates of cRI mRNA and cRI protein and tested for sensitivity to RNase cytotoxicity. In these experiments additional RNases were used: MCA-BS-RNase, a monomeric derivative of BS-RNase with no cytotoxic activity and very sensitive to cRI inhibition; KSRE-BS-RNase, a monomeric variant of BS-RNase; and AR-RNase A, a variant of RNase A, both moderately cytotoxic and moderately evasive of cRI inhibition.The cytotoxicity tests, summarized in Table I, confirm and expand the results obtained with transiently transfected HeLa cells. They reveal that non-cytotoxic RNases, namely RNase A, HP-RNase, and MCA-BS-RNase, are equally ineffective on wild-type and cRI-deprived HeLa cells. Cytotoxic RNases, on the other hand, have more pronounced cytotoxic effects on cRI-deprived HeLa cells.Table IThe effects on RNase cytotoxicity of the suppression of the cytosolic RNase inhibitor in HeLa cellsRNaseCytotoxicity, IC50wt-HeLa cellsHeLa cells — cRI-μg/mlRNase A>200>200HP-RNase>200>200MCA-BS-RNase>200>200BS-RNase19 ± 212 ± 1AR-RNase A100 ± 134 ± 4RE-HP-RNase49 ± 125 ± 1KSRE-BS-RNase37 ± 413 ± 1 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWe report here the silencing with dsRNA of the gene encoding the cytosolic RNase inhibitor, obtained when the cells were transiently or stably transfected with a plasmid encoding a dsRNA complementary to cRI mRNA. Transfected HeLa cells were found to have no detectable cRI mRNA nor cRI protein. No significant changes were observed in morphology or growth rate of transfected cells.When HeLa cells lacking detectable cRI were treated with natural or recombinant cytotoxic RNases, strongly or weakly cytotoxic, the cytotoxic activity of these RNases was enhanced. In contrast, non-cytotoxic RNases remained non-cytotoxic in cells deprived of cRI.These results indicate that the cytosolic RNase inhibitor may not have the proposed protective role against foreign RNases as it only affects the activity of RNases that are intrinsically cytotoxic. On the other hand, the absence of cRI did not render HeLa cells susceptible to any other foreign RNases. As noncytotoxic RNases are strongly inhibited by cRI, one would have expected that cells deprived of cRI, hence lacking cRI protection, would become susceptible to these RNases.The results on the effects of onconase and BS-RNase can clarify the relationships between cRI and cytotoxic RNases. Onconase does not bind and is not inhibited by cRI. This may not be surprising, as onconase is an amphibian RNase, and amphibia do not have cRI, a mammalian protein. Thus, its cytotoxic activity is not affected by the presence or absence of cRI in target cells.BS-RNase is not inhibited by cRI because it is a dimeric protein, a structural feature that renders this RNase unable to fit in the cRI horseshoe cavity. Its dimeric structure is maintained by non-covalent forces but also by two intersubunit disulfides. Furthermore, the protein exists in two quaternary isoforms: an MXM form characterized by the exchange or “swap” between monomers of their N-terminal arms and an M=M form with no exchange (23Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Under conditions of mild reduction, the intersubunit disulfides are cleaved, which generates either a non-covalent dimer from the MXM form, with monomers still held together by the exchange of terminal arms, or free monomers from the M=M form (23Piccoli R. Tamburrini M. Piccialli G. Di Donato A. Parente A. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The reduction of intersubunit disulfides of BS-RNase very likely occurs also in the reducing environment of the cytosol, where internalized BS-RNase is directed and degrades rRNA (24Mastronicola M.R. Piccoli R. G D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, M monomers are inhibited by cRI, whereas the non-covalent dimers are not inhibited (9Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the cytotoxic activity of BS-RNase can be attributed to its resistance to cRI as a dimeric non-covalent dimer (9Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), while the free monomers liberated in the cytosol are neutralized by cRI. In cells deprived of cRI, free monomers would not be neutralized by cRI, so their cytotoxicity would add to that of the non-covalent dimer, thereby enhancing BS-RNase cytotoxicity.Clearly, an RNase can interact with the cytosolic inhibitor only if it reaches the cytosol. Naturally cytotoxic RNases, i.e. BS-RNase and onconase, do reach the cytosol and degrade rRNA (24Mastronicola M.R. Piccoli R. G D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or tRNA (25Rybak S.M. Newton D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), respectively. Non-cytotoxic RNase A, once introduced into cells through membrane entrapment, is directed to lysosomes and is not cytotoxic (26Dice J.F. Terlecky S.R. Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 1990; 7: 211-233PubMed Google Scholar). However, if it is directly microinjected into the cell cytosol, it degrades rRNA and becomes cytotoxic (25Rybak S.M. Newton D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Although the cytosol has proved to be the final intracellular destination only for intrinsically cytotoxic RNases, we can assume that RNases engineered to be cytotoxic by increasing their resistance to cRI must also have access to the cytosol. It should be noted that when cytotoxic RNases are inactivated as enzymes they lose their ability to degrade cytosolic RNA and their cytotoxicity (5Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 491-514Crossref Google Scholar). We can speculate that the structural alterations generated by the engineering of RNases, besides rendering them (partially) resistant to the cytosolic inhibitor, also enable them to reach the cytosol. Obviously, once an RNase reaches the cytosol, it would not escape the action of cRI. Hence, non-cytotoxic RNases are non-cytotoxic, not because they are susceptible to cRI neutralization but because they most likely do not have access to the cytosol. We believe that it is worth testing this hypothesis, especially because if cRI is not, or it is not primarily, an anti-RNase guardian, we should still search for its yet unknown physiological role.

Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). It is a leucine-rich repeat protein, with a high content of cysteine residues and a three-dimensional structure that resembles a horseshoe (3Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). It avidly binds (with few exceptions, see below) the extracellular RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily (4Beintema J.J. Schuller C. Irie M. Carsana A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 51: 165-192Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and inhibits their enzymatic activity. The physiological role of cRI has not been ascertained conclusively. It has been proposed that cRI could regulate cellular RNA levels or modulate RNases with a specific biological action, e.g. angiogenins, or protect cellular RNAs from extracellular RNases (2Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 621-658Crossref Google Scholar). This last hypothesis, that cRI protects against foreign RNases, has recently received increasing consensus based on the following observations. Cytotoxic RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily, namely onconase from amphibia and bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase), are resistant to the inhibitory action of cRI (5Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1997: 491-514Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, non-cytotoxic RNases with high affinity for cRI, such as bovine (RNase A) or human (HP-RNase) pancreatic RNases, or monomerized BS-RNase, become cytotoxic when engineered through directed mutagenesis into RNases with a decreased affinity for cRI (6Antignani A.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic, dimeric BS-RNase, which is completely resistant to cRI inhibition, loses its cytotoxicity when it is dissociated into stable, active monomers, which are cRI-sensitive (9Murthy B.S. De Lorenzo C. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3880-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that cells manipulated to increase their cRI levels become more resistant to RNase cytotoxicity (11Haigis M.C. Kurten E.L. Raines R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the results of other investigations cast doubt on the conclusion that the cytotoxic action of an RNase depends, mainly or exclusively, on its ability to evade the neutralizing action of cRI and that the physiological role of cRI is to protect cells from extra-cellular RNases. Cases have been reported of RNases of the pancreatic type superfamily that have been engineered into cytotoxic RNase variants, yet are inhibited by cRI (12Bosch M. Benito A. Ribo M. Puig T.

It has been reported that when RNase A is dimerized through lyophilization from acetic acid solutions, it acquires cytotoxic properties (14Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T.

The compound 5-phospho-d-ribosyl α-1-diphosphate (PRPP) 1The abbreviations used are: PRPP, 5-phospho-d-ribosyl α-1-diphosphate; NHR, non-homologous region. is an important component of the metabolism of most organisms. PRPP is a precursor of the biosynthesis of purine, pyrimidine, and pyridine nucleotides, as well as of the amino acids tryptophan and histidine (1Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of PRPP is catalyzed by PRPP synthase (ATP: d-ribose 5-phosphate pyrophosphotransferase, EC 2.7.6.1), which is encoded by a PRS gene: ribose 5-phosphate + ATP → PRPP + AMP (2Khorana H.G. Fernandes J.F. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except for certain specialized mutants of Escherichia coli, all freeliving organisms contain at least one gene encoding PRPP synthase. These E. coli mutants require guanosine, uridine, histidine, tryptophan, and NAD (1Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1148-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hove-Jensen B. Mol.

Eriksen T.A. Poulsen T.S. Hove-Jensen B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, S. cerevisiae PRPP synthase subunits 1 and 5 contain additional amino acids, which constitute non-homologous regions (NHRs). Thus, subunit 1 contains one NHR (NHR1) consisting of 105 amino acids, whereas subunit 5 contains NHR5-1, consisting of 110 amino acids, and NHR5-2, consisting of 63 amino acids. The “insertion points” of NHR1 and NHR5-2 are at similar locations, as seen by amino acid sequence alignments of PRS1- and PRS5-specified polypeptides. As a consequence of these NHRs, the lengths of subunits 1 and 5 are 427 and 496 amino acids, respectively. The amino acid sequence identity of subunit 1 or 5 with PRPP synthases from E. coli, B. subtilis, or human is 41–54%. In general, microorganisms contain a single PRPP synthase-specifying gene. To elucidate the role of five PRS genes in S. cerevisiae, I have undertaken a biochemical and genetic analysis of the oligomerization of PRPP synthase by expression of S. cerevisiae PRS genes in E. coli. Genes encoding S. cerevisiae PRPP synthase subunits are designated by PRS in capital letters, whereas the E. coli PRPP synthase-encoding gene is designated prs. For clarity, the S. cerevisiae PRS genes may be designated as PRSSc and that of E. coli may be designated as prsEc. Microbial Strains and Growth Media—The S. cerevisiae and E. coli K-12 strains used are listed in Table I. S. cerevisiae strain YN94-2 was grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (8Kaiser C. Michaelis S.

Open table in a new tab DNA of S. cerevisiae strain X2180-1A was used as template for the isolation of PRS genes by PCR. PRS1 was isolated with the oligodeoxyribonucleotides Y1u (5′-GACGCATGCCGGAGGTTCTTCTCATGCGTAAGTGTAAAATTTTTGTTGGTAACTC-3′) and Y1d (5′-CTTAGATTCGAATTATTACAGAGCTGCCAAAGAGTCAAATAAAACGG-3′), PRS2 was isolated with PRS2-u (5′-CAAGACGCATGCCGGAGGTTCTTCTCATGTCTACAAACAG-3′) and PRS2-d (5′-CTTAGATTCGAATTATTAAACAGGCGCATGTG-3′), PRS3 was isolated with P3u (5′-CAAGACGCATGCCGGAGGTTCTTCTCATGCCAACAAATTCCATC-3′) and P3d (5′-ACTTAGATCGATTATTATAAGGGATAATTCTTAAATAAATAAG), PRS4 was isolated with P4-u (5′-CAAGACGCATGCCGGAGGTTCTTCTCATGGCTATAAATAGTATC-3′) and P4-d (5′-CTTAGATTCGAATTACTATACTGGAGCATGGG-3′), and PRS5 was isolated with Y5u (5′-GACGCATGCCGGAGGTTCTTCTCATGTCAATGAGTAATATTGTTGTTTTTGGAGGGG-3′) and Y5d (5′-CTTAGATTCGAATTACTACCATCCATGCTCGAACAACATAGAAATGG-3′). PCR products containing PRS1 or PRS5 were digested by restriction endonucleases SphI and BstBI and ligated to similarly restricted DNA of pHO11, which contains a wild-type version of the prsEc coding sequence together with flanking E. coli DNA sequences (387 and 301 bp upstream and downstream, respectively). PCR products containing S. cerevisiae PRS2, PRS3, or PRS4 were digested by restriction endonucleases SphI and BstBI and ligated to similarly restricted DNA of pHO4, which contains a wild-type version of the prsEc coding sequence together with flanking E. coli DNA sequences (514 and 547 bp upstream and downstream, respectively). Plasmid pHO4 was constructed by digesting DNA of pHO2 by restriction endonuclease AvaI followed by ligation. The effect of these procedures, which resulted in pHO405 (PRS1), pHO485 (PRS2), pHO491 (PRS3), pHO482 (PRS4), and pHO420 (PRS5), was replacement of the prsEc coding sequence with those of PRSSc and retaining the flanking sequences of E. coli origin to facilitate gene replacement in this organism. Plasmids harboring tandem arrangements of PRSSc genes were constructed by PCR amplification of S. cerevisiae PRS2, PRS4, or PRS5 DNA with oligodeoxyribonucleotides that resulted in recognition sites for restriction endonuclease BstBI at both ends of the resulting DNA fragments. The DNA fragments were digested by BstBI and ligated to BstBI-digested DNA of plasmids harboring S. cerevisiae PRS1, PRS2, or PRS5, each of which had a BstBI recognition site located immediately downstream of the coding sequence. PRS5 was amplified with YP5Up2 (5′-CCACGATTCGAAGGAGTGCACGTATGTCAATGAGTAATATTGTTGTTTTTGG-3′) and Y5D and with DNA of pHO420 as template. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated to DNA of pHO405 to obtain pHO443 (PRS1 PRS5) or ligated to DNA of pHO485 to obtain pHO503 (PRS2 PRS5). PRS2 was amplified with the oligodeoxyribonucleotides GP2U-3 (5′-GGCTACTTCGAAAGGAAACAGAATTCATGTCTACAAACAGTATTAAGTTG-3′) and 2d (5′-CAGAAGCTTTTCGAAAGGCCTGCCGCGCGATGACCATGGTACGTACTCCTTATTAAACAGGCGCATGTG-3′) and PRS2 DNA as template. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated to DNA of pHO405 to obtain pHO448 (PRS1 PRS2) or ligated to DNA of pHO482 to obtain pHO504 (PRS4 PRS2). PRS4 was amplified with GP4U (5′-CTAGTTCGAAGAGGAGAAATTCGATGGTCATCGACCTTGAGC-3′) and GP4D (5′-GAATGGTTCGAATTACTATACTGGAGCATGGG-3′) and PRS4 as the template. The resulting DNA fragment was ligated to DNA of pHO405 to obtain pHO438 (PRS1 PRS4) or ligated to DNA of pHO420 to obtain pHO429 (PRS5 PRS4). The inserts of all the plasmids constructed with PCR-amplified DNA fragments were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences of S. cerevisiae PRS1, PRS2, PRS3, and PRS5 were identical to those published previously, whereas the nucleotide sequence of the PRS4 gene used in the present work differed slightly from that published previously (4Carter A.T. Narbad A. Pearson B.M. Beck K.F. Logghe M. Contreras R. Schweizer M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1031-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Hernando Y. Parr A. Schweizer M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6404-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2The nucleotide sequence of the PRS4 gene used in the present work differed slightly from that published previously. Codon 82 specified lysine in the present sequence rather than glutamine, whereas codon 161 specified threonine in the present sequence rather than alanine, and the codon specifying arginine 162 in the original sequence was absent in the present. Nucleotide sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems Model 310 genetic analyzer using the cycle sequencing method with dye terminators as recommended by the supplier (ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit, PE Applied Biosystems). The oligodeoxyribonucleotides used as primers were provided by Hobolth DNA Syntese (Hillerød, Denmark). PCR was performed in a Trio-Thermoblock (Biometra) with chromosomal or plasmid DNA as template by standard procedures using DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosum (Invitrogen). Complementation—PRPP-less strains (Δprs) of E. coli, such as HO773, require purines and pyrimidines as well as histidine, tryptophan, and NAD (3Hove-Jensen B. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Complementation of the Δprs allele or of a PRSSc gene by various plasmid-borne genes was analyzed by plating cells on minimal medium containing uridine, histidine, and tryptophan and with or without NAD or guanosine present. The presence of active PRPP synthase relieves one or more of these requirements dependent of the activity of the enzyme, i.e. the amount of PRPP produced. NZY medium contains all of these compounds but NAD. Thus, strain HO773 will grow in NZY medium only when supplemented with NAD. On the other hand, the formation of PRPP synthase activity in HO773 results in NAD prototrophy. Gene Replacement—PRS genes were inserted into the E. coli chromosome in place of prsEc by using a two-step procedure involving a polA1 strain (HO480) and a pol+ Δprs-4::KanrhemA strain (HO2120) essentially as described before (14Bower S.G. Harlow K.W. Switzer R.L. Hove-Jensen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10287-10291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of the various PRS genes at the proper position was confirmed by genetic mapping and by nucleotide sequencing of DNA fragments produced by PCR. The template for this PCR was chromosomal DNA isolated from each strain. Primers annealed outside the replaced DNA fragment. In all of the strains used, the predicted gene replacement had occurred. Bacteriophage P1 transduction was performed as described previously (15Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 268-274Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Extracts for Enzyme Analysis—One hundred milliliters of S. cerevisiae culture grown to saturation in YPD medium was harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1.0 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), EDTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), leupeptin (Sigma) (1 mg liter–1), and mixed with 1 ml of glass beads (∼0.5 μm) (Sigma). Cells were broken by agitation in a Mikro-Dismembrator U (Braun Biotech International) at a frequency of 1600 s–1 for 2.5 min (16Jazwinski S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation to form a crude extract. E. coli was grown to saturation in NZY medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), and broken by ultrasonic treatment. The debris was removed by centrifugation. When the indicated ammonium sulfate was added to a crude extract, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and dialyzed against the same buffer. Assay of PRPP Synthase Activity—PRPP synthase activity was assayed as follows unless otherwise stated. At zero time, 10 μl of extract, appropriately diluted and prewarmed at 30 °C, was mixed with 90 μlof a reaction mixture, prewarmed at 30 °C, to give the following final concentrations: 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.5), 5 mm ribose 5-phosphate, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 15 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Roche Applied Science), 1 μmol min–1 of pyruvate kinase (Roche Applied Science), 2 mm (10 GBq mol–1) [γ-32P]ATP, prepared as described previously (17Jensen K.F. Houlberg U. Nygaard P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μl) were removed after 1, 3, and 6 min of incubation at 30 °C and mixed with 5 μl of 0.33 m formic acid. This 15 μl was applied to a polyethyleneimine-coated cellulose thin-layer chromatography plate, prepared as described previously (18Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6852-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chromatogram was dried and developed for 18 cm in 0.85 m potassium phosphate, which had been titrated to pH 3.4 with 0.85 m phosphoric acid, to separate radiolabeled ATP and PRPP, which were quantitated in an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Ribose 5-phosphate-dependent formation of PRPP was determined by parallel incubations as above but without ribose 5-phosphate present. Activity without Pi present was determined as above except that the potassium phosphate buffer was replaced by Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). Determination of PRPP and Ribonucleoside Triphosphate Pools— E. coli cells were grown at 30 °C in Tris-buffered minimal medium containing 0.3 mm Pi (17Jensen K.F. Houlberg U. Nygaard P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with glucose as the carbon source and with guanosine, uridine, histidine, and tryptophan present. After several generations of exponential growth, carrier-free 32Pi (Nex-053, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a specific radioactivity of ∼3 TBq mol–1. After three generations of growth, samples were removed, and PRPP and ribonucleoside triphosphates were extracted and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-impregnated cellulose plastic sheets (17Jensen K.F. Houlberg U. Nygaard P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantitated in an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Cloning of and Complementation by PRS Genes—The five PRS genes were cloned in pHO4 or pHO11, which are derivatives of pBR322, in a manner that caused replacement of the prsEc coding sequence with those of the five PRS genes. There was a 3-fold advantage with these constructions. Firstly, it allowed expression of the PRS genes in E. coli to be driven by the well characterized prsEc promoter. Secondly, the presence of E. coli prs-flanking nucleotide sequences in the recombinant PRS-harboring plasmids allowed gene replacement by homologous recombination to occur, and a series of isogenic strains was obtained. These strains differed only in their PRS coding sequences. Finally, with all of the five PRS genes present in either the chromosome of E. coli or a plasmid, the effect of combining any two PRS genes could be analyzed. Complementation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly PRPP-less mutants of E. coli require guanosine, uridine, histidine, tryptophan, and NAD for growth. Transformants were plated on medium lacking guanosine or NAD, and growth in the absence of either of these compounds indicates acquisition of a PRS gene that specifies active PRPP synthase. Complementation was analyzed in the following strains: HO773, which contains a large deletion of the prsEc gene, resulting in lack of PRPP synthase activity; HO2264, HO2268, HO2480, HO2284, and HO2481, which had the prsEc gene replaced by the S. cerevisiae PRS1, PRS5, PRS2, PRS3, and PRS4 gene, respectively. These six strains required NAD for growth, indicating the formation of inactive PRS gene products. In addition, none of the five PRS genes (harbored in pHO405, pHO485, pHO491, pHO482, or pHO420) were able to complement the Δprs mutant allele harbored in strain HO773, as seen by the requirement of NAD for the growth of the transformants (Table II). In contrast, a plasmid-borne wild-type allele of E. coli prs complemented Δprs. As expected, the non-prs harboring plasmid pBR322 was unable to complement Δprs. Strain HO2264 (PRS1) transformed with the PRS3-harboring plasmid pHO491 was able to grow in the absence of guanosine, which suggests that the PRS1-specified polypeptide together with the PRS3-specified polypeptide resulted in the formation of active PRPP synthase. If a less severe selective pressure was applied by omitting NAD rather than guanosine, the growth of HO2264 transformed with pHO485 (PRS2) was observed, which indicated the formation of an enzyme with low activity. PRS1 (pHO405), PRS4 (pHO482), or PRS5 (pHO420) did not complement PRS1. Strain HO2268 (PRS5) grew without guanosine present when transformed with PRS2-harboring or PRS4-harboring plasmids (pHO485 and pHO482, respectively) but required guanosine and NAD when transformed with plasmids harboring S. cerevisiae PRS1, PRS3, or PRS5 (pHO405, pHO491, and pHO420, respectively). Thus, PRS5-specified polypeptide together with polypeptide specified by PRS2 or PRS4 appeared to result in the formation of active PRPP synthase. The PRS2 gene (strain HO2480) was complemented by PRS5 (pHO420), and when the less selective pressure without NAD present was applied, also by PRS1 (pHO405). PRS3 (strain HO2284) was complemented by PRS1 (pHO405). Finally, PRS4 (strain HO2481) was complemented by PRS5 (pHO420) when guanosine was omitted and by PRS1 (pHO405) when NAD was omitted, indicating the formation of active PRPP synthase by subunit 4 together with subunit 5, and to a lesser extent, subunit 4 with subunit 1. The data of Table II show that identical results, with one exception, were obtained in reciprocal complementation, i.e. the same result was obtained with one gene in the chromosome and another in a plasmid and vice versa. The exception was PRS1 and PRS4, which only resulted in active enzyme with PRS1 expressed from a plasmid. Each strain responded identically when transformed with pHO11 or when transformed with pBR322. Although I did not directly analyze expression of the five plasmid-harbored PRS genes, the results described above show that each of them were indeed expressed as at least one pairwise combination involving each of the five genes produced active PRPP synthase.Table IIComplementation of Δprs and PRSSc by PRSSc genesE. coli host strain (PRS gene/allele in chromosome)Growth of transformants containing plasmid (PRS gene/allele)pHO405 (PRS1)pHO485 (PRS2)pHO491 (PRS3)pHO482 (PRS4)pHO420 (PRS5)pHO11 (prsEc)pBR322 (None)HO773 (Δprs)-----+-HO2264 (PRS1)-- (+)+--+-HO2480 (PRS2)- (+)---++-HO2284 (PRS3)+----+-HO2481 (PRS4)- (+)---++-HO2268 (PRS5)-+-+-+- Open table in a new tab I furthermore constructed plasmids harboring artificial bicistronic operons. Of these constructions, those harboring S. cerevisiae PRS1 PRS2, PRS5 PRS2, or PRS5 PRS4 complemented Δprs, resulting in an NAD+ Guo+ phenotype, whereas that harboring PRS1 PRS4 resulted in a NAD+ Guo– phenotype. The constructions with S. cerevisiae PRS1 PRS5, PRS2 PRS3, PRS2 PRS4, PRS3 PRS4, or PRS3 PRS5 did not complement Δprs (data not shown), i.e. a result similar to that described above with pairwise combinations of chromosomal and plasmid-borne genes. A plasmid harboring S. cerevisiae PRS1 PRS3 was not constructed. PRPP Synthase Activity, PRPP, and Ribonucleoside Triphosphate Pools of E. coli Strains Harboring Two PRS Genes— Extracts of the strains that contained two PRS genes with a resulting NAD+ Guo– or NAD+ Guo+ phenotype were analyzed for their content of PRPP synthase activity (Table III). The data show that the activity of strain HO2284 (PRS3)/pHO405 (PRS1) was 350 nmol (min × mg of protein)–1, whereas the remaining strains (i.e. those containing S. cerevisiae PRS1 PRS2, PRS1 PRS4, PRS5 PRS2, PRS5 PRS4) had no detectable PRPP synthase activity. Similarly, extract of strain HO2264 (PRS1)/pHO491 (PRS3) contained no detectable activity. For comparison, values for PRPP synthase activity determined in extracts of defined wild-type strains of S. cerevisiae and E. coli are also given in Table III. This lack of PRPP synthase in extracts of most of the strains may seem surprising as most of them grew in the absence of any addition, and thus, should contain readily detectable amounts of PRPP synthase activity. I therefore analyzed the synthesis of PRPP in vivo by determination of PRPP pools as well as of ribonucleoside triphosphate pools (Table III). Apart from strain HO2281 (PRS4)/pHO405 (PRS1), which was unable to grow in the low phosphate medium used for pool analysis, the strains produced detectable amounts of PRPP, albeit in very different amounts. Consistent with their NAD+ Guo– phenotype, the strains harboring S. cerevisiae PRS1 PRS2 contained very low PRPP pools, whereas their ribonucleoside triphosphate pools were essentially normal when compared with the pools of the E. coli wild-type strain HO698 (Table III). The remaining strains analyzed revealed increased pool sizes of PRPP as well as of ribonucleoside triphosphates, which may indicate altered regulation"

In the VHL ubiquitin ligase, the VHL protein serves as the substrate recognition subunit, which is linked by the adaptor protein Elongin C to a heterodimeric Cul2/Rbx1 module that activates ubiquitylation of target proteins by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc5. In SCF ubiquitin ligases, F-box proteins serve as substrate recognition subunits, which are linked by the Elongin C-like adaptor protein Skp1 to a Cul1/Rbx1 module that activates ubiquitylation of target proteins, in most cases by the E2 Cdc34. In this report, we investigate the functions of the Elongin C and Skp1 proteins in reconstitution of VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligases. We identify Elongin C and Skp1 structural elements responsible for selective interaction with their cognate Cullin/Rbx1 modules. In addition, using altered specificity Elongin C and F-box protein mutants, we investigate models for the mechanism underlying E2 selection by VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligases. Our findings provide evidence that E2 selection by VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligases is determined not solely by the Cullin/Rbx1 module, the target protein, or the integrity of the substrate recognition subunit but by yet to be elucidated features of these macromolecular complexes.

In addition, using altered specificity Elongin C and F-box protein mutants, we investigate models for the mechanism underlying E2 selection by VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligases. Our findings provide evidence that E2 selection by VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligases is determined not solely by the Cullin/Rbx1 module, the target protein, or the integrity of the substrate recognition subunit but by yet to be elucidated features of these macromolecular complexes.

In the context of the VHL ubiquitin ligase, the VHL protein serves as the substrate recognition subunit and is linked by the adaptor protein Elongin C to a heterodimeric Cul2/Rbx1 module that functions as a potent activator of ubiquitylation of target proteins by an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Elongin B, a ubiquitin-like protein, associates with the complex through interactions with Elongin C and appears to stabilize the binding of Elongin C to VHL. The best characterized substrates of the VHL ubiquitin ligase are the HIFα family of DNA binding transcription factors (1Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C.

Upon VHL binding to their hydroxylated oxygen-dependent degradation domains, HIFα family members are rapidly ubiquitylated by the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex and degraded by the proteasome. In cells grown in hypoxic conditions, HIFα family members are not hydroxylated. Accordingly, under hypoxic conditions, the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex cannot bind HIFαs and promote their ubiquitylation and degradation, so cellular levels of these transcription factors rise, leading to activation of hypoxically regulated genes. The large family of SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases share striking structural similarities with the VHL ubiquitin ligase. SCF ubiquitin ligases are composed of one of many F-box proteins, the Elongin C-like protein Skp1, Cullin family member Cul1 (called Cdc53 in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and Rbx1 (4Kamura T.

Fig. 8 (see below) was generated with the PyMOL package (DeLano Scientific, LLC; www.pymol.org). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Elongin C and Skp1 proteins share significant amino acid sequence similarity and belong to a protein superfamily with shared three-dimensional structure. Elongin C and Skp1 function as adaptors that recruit heterodimeric Cul2/Rbx1 and Cul1/Rbx1 modules, respectively, into VHL and SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. In the case of the VHL ubiquitin ligase, Elongin C recruits a Cul2/Rbx1 module to the complex by interacting specifically with a BC box in the VHL protein (Ref. 40Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 284: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar and references therein) and with an N-terminal Cul2 region (41Pause A. Peterson B. Schaffar G. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9533-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the case of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, Skp1 functions by an apparently similar mechanism as Elongin C to recruit a Cul1/Rbx1 module to the complex by interacting specifically with an F-box in F-box proteins and with an N-terminal Cul1 region (42Wu K.

To begin to study the relationship between the roles of Elongin C and Skp1 in reconstitution of their respective ubiquitin ligases, we sought to identify Elongin C sequences required for its interaction with Cul2 and for its recruitment of the Cul2/Rbx1 module into the VHL complex. To accomplish this, we constructed baculoviruses encoding a systematic series of Elongin C deletion mutants and analyzed the abilities of these Elongin C mutants to support the assembly of VBC and of the complete VBC-Cul2/Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase in Sf21 insect cells. Sf21 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses encoding VHL, Elongin B, Cul2, Rbx1, and wild type or mutant Elongin C with an N-terminal epitope tag recognized by the HPC4 monoclonal antibody. Elongin C-containing complexes were immunoprecipitated with HPC4 monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of individual subunits of the VHL complex. As shown in Fig. 2A, recruitment of Cul2 to the VHL complex was strongly dependent on both Elongins B and C. Elongin C was quite sensitive to deletions. Only three of the mutants could assemble similarly to wild type Elongin C into the VBC complex; two of these, Δ41–50 and Δ51–60, were defective in recruitment of Cul2 into the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that Elongin C sequences between residues 41 and 60 are not crucial for VBC assembly but are important for Elongin C interaction with Cul2 and recruitment of Cul2 into the VHL ubiquitin ligase complex. Notably, some residues within the corresponding region of Skp1 appear to contribute to formation of the Skp1-Cul1 interface (43Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C.

To investigate further the role of Elongin C sequences 41–60 in recruitment of Cul2 into the VHL ubiquitin ligase, we carried out domain swaps between Elongin C and Skp1 in an effort to identify an Elongin C-Skp1 chimeric protein capable of recruiting a Cul1/Rbx1 module into the VHL complex. In one mutant, designated M2, Elongin C residues 40–47 were replaced with Skp1 residues 25–32. These stretches of sequence in Elongin C and Skp1 fall largely within conserved helix 2 (Fig. 1) (40Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P.

A second Elongin C-Skp1 chimeric protein, designated M1, was created by replacing Elongin C residues 47–57 with Skp1 residues 32–42. Elongin C residues 47–57 form a loop (loop 3) between helix 2 and strand 3 in human Elongin C; loop 3 was poorly resolved in the Elongin C x-ray structures (40Stebbins C.E. Kaelin W.G. Pavletich N.P.

https://openalex.org/W2091005378,"FP prostanoid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that consist of two isoforms named FPA and FPB. Both isoforms activate inositol phosphate second messenger signaling pathways by their endogenous ligand prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Previously we have shown that both isoforms undergo Rho-mediated cell rounding following treatment with PGF2α. Following the removal of PGF2α, however, FPA-expressing cells return to their original morphology, whereas FPB-expressing cells do not. It was also found that PGF2α-could activate T-cell factor (Tcf)/β-catenin signaling in cells expressing the FPB isoform but not in cells expressing the FPA isoform. We now show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) can induce cell rounding and stimulate the formation of inositol phosphates to the same extent as PGF2α in cells expressing either the FPA or FPB isoforms. However, PGE2 has much lower efficacy as compared with PGF2α for the activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling in FPB-expressing cells, and the cell rounding is reversible. Interestingly, pretreatment of FPB -expressing cells with PGE2-attenuated PGF2α-stimulated Tcf/β-catenin signaling in a dosedependent manner while having no effect on PGF2α-stimulated inositol phosphates formation. Thus, the ratio of endogenous PGE2 and PGF2α has the potential to selectively regulate one signaling pathway over another. This represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of cell signaling that is distinct from regulation occurring at the level of the receptor and its effector pathways. FP prostanoid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that consist of two isoforms named FPA and FPB. Both isoforms activate inositol phosphate second messenger signaling pathways by their endogenous ligand prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). Previously we have shown that both isoforms undergo Rho-mediated cell rounding following treatment with PGF2α.

Thus, the ratio of endogenous PGE2 and PGF2α has the potential to selectively regulate one signaling pathway over another. This represents a novel mechanism for the regulation of cell signaling that is distinct from regulation occurring at the level of the receptor and its effector pathways. The ovine FPA and FPB prostanoid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that are generated by alternative mRNA splicing of their carboxyl termini (1Pierce K.L. Bailey T.J. Hoyer P.B. Gil D.W. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 883-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Relative to one another, the FPB isoform represents a FPA receptor in which the last 46 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus have been removed and replaced with one amino acid. The endogenous ligand of these receptors is considered to be prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Tcf, T-cell factor; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; HEK, human embryonic kidney.1The abbreviations used are: PGF2α, prostaglandin F2α; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; Tcf, T-cell factor; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; HEK, human embryonic kidney.; however, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGD2 can bind to these FP receptor isoforms with affinities that are only 10–30-fold less than PGF2α (1Pierce K.L.

The FPA and FPB receptor isoforms are both coupled to Gαq and following stimulation by PGF2α both will activate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. PGF2α will also activate the small G-protein, Rho, in cells expressing either the FPA or FPB receptors (3Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The activation of Rho leads to cell rounding and the formation of cobblestone-like aggregates of cells. Interestingly in FPA-expressing cells these shape changes show rapid reversal following the removal of PGF2α, but in FPB-expressing cells the shape changes are persistent and appear to be irreversible following the removal of PGF2α (4Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In FPB-expressing cells (but not in FPA-expressing cells) PGF2α can also produce a marked activation of T-cell factor (Tcf)/β-catenin signaling (5Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling requires the activation of Rho but again is unique for the FPB isoform even though both isoforms can activate Rho (6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, Tcf regulates the expression of a number of genes, including c-myc, cyclin D1, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (7Srivastava S. Verma M. Henson D.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of COX-2 expression by Tcf is significant given the ability of the FPB receptor to activate Tcf/β-catenin signaling, and we have recently shown that PGF2α stimulation of the FPB receptor leads to a Rho-dependent activation of COX-2 promoter activity (8Fujino H. Regan J.W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 465: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of colon cancer as well as other cancers is an up-regulation of COX-2 activity and an increased biosynthesis of various prostanoids, most notably PGE2 and PGF2α (7Srivastava S. Verma M. Henson D.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 9Oka M. Inaba A. Uchiyama T. Hazama S. Shimoda K. Suzuki M. Suzuki T. Am. J.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Increased levels of PGE2 and PGF2α would have the potential to further activate their receptors and thereby establish a positive feedback loop. Experimental evidence supporting the development of such a positive feedback loop involving murine EP2 receptors and the up-regulation of COX-2 expression has been described (12Sonoshita M. Takaku K. Sasaki N. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1048-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the potential of FP and EP prostanoid receptors to form positive feedback loops involving the up-regulation of COX-2 has been described (13Fujino H. Regan J.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 335-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The phylogeny of the prostanoid receptor family suggests that the primordial prostanoid receptor was an EP subtype whose endogenous ligand is PGE2. In addition to its high affinity for the EP receptors, PGE2 has ∼100 nm affinity for the FP and DP prostanoid receptors. Given that both PGE2 and PGF2α are frequently up-regulated in cancer, we were interested in the possible interactions of these compounds at the level of the activation of the FPA and FPB receptor isoforms. We were specifically interested in whether both PGE2 and PGF2α had the same efficacy for the activation of inositol phosphates hydrolysis and Tcf/β-catenin signaling and whether they could both induce changes in cellular morphology. Interestingly, both prostanoids had similar efficacy for the activation of inositol phosphates hydrolysis, but PGE2 had significantly lower efficacy for the activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, pretreatment of FPB-expressing cells with PGE2 inhibited subsequent PGF2α-stimulated Tcf/β-catenin signaling without changing the PGF2α-stimulated accumulation of total inositol phosphates. Both compounds induced changes in cellular morphology, but the effects of PGE2 on FPB cells were reversible, whereas the effects of PGF2α were not. Total Inositol Phosphates Assay—HEK-293 cells stably expressing the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms were generated and cultured as described previously (3Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These two cell lines have comparable levels of receptor expression judged both by radioligand binding (FPA, 3.55 ± 0.28 pmol/mg protein; FPB, 4.09 ± 0.49 pmol/mg protein) and by PGF2α-stimulated inositol phosphate formation (14Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-stimulated total inositol phosphates accumulation was determined by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (14Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Pierce K.L. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 353-358PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated and incubated overnight with 3 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol. Cells were trypsinized and centrifuged, and aliquots of 0.5 to 1.0 × 107 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 mm LiCl. After drug additions, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and 2.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/water (1:1:0.5) was added. 900 μl of the aqueous phase was removed and mixed with 2 ml of water and applied to a 2.5-ml column of AG1-X8 anion exchange resin. After three washes with 5 ml of water and two washes with 5 ml of 5 mm borax/60 mm sodium formate buffer, the 3H-labeled total inositol phosphates were eluted with 2 ml of 0.2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cell Imaging—Cells were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes under half-confluent conditions and were grown without any changes of media for 3–4 days as described previously (4Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To examine agonist-induced cell rounding and its reversal, either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate or 0.1% Me2SO, final concentration, respectively) or agonist (1 μm PGF2α or 1 μm PGE2, final concentration, respectively) were added to the media, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and were placed in 1 ml of Opti-MEM and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy using an Olympus IX70 microscope, and images were obtained and processed using a Olympus MagnaFire camera system. Tcf Reporter Gene Experiments—Cells grown in six-well plates were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg/well of either the TOP flash or FOP flash reporter plasmids (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (5Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated at 37 °C with either vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate or 0.1% Me2SO), 1 μm PGF2α, or 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h and were rapidly washed three times each with 1 ml/well Opti-MEM and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of Opti-MEM containing 250 μg/ml Geneticin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin. In the pretreatment experiments, cells were pretreated with either vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) or various concentrations of PGE2 for 15 min followed by the addition of vehicle (0.002% sodium carbonate) or 10 nm PGF2α for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell extracts were prepared using the Luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using a Turner TD-20/20 luminometer as described previously (5Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of protein per sample. Measurements were corrected for background activity by subtraction of the FOP flash values from the corresponding TOP flash values. The signal transduction properties of PGF2α and PGE2 were characterized in untransfected HEK cells and HEK cells stably expressing either the FPA or FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms. Fig. 1 shows dose response curves for these prostanoids on the accumulation of total inositol phosphates. PGF2α stimulated total inositol phosphates accumulation to similar maximal levels and with similar EC50 values in both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells (21 nm and 16 nm, respectively). PGE2 also stimulated total inositol phosphates accumulation to a similar maximal extent as PGF2α in both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells. However, the EC50 values for PGE2 were higher than for PGF2α (695 nm and 117 nm, respectively). Treatment of untransfected HEK cells with PGF2α or PGE2 had negligible effects on total inositol phosphates formation. Thus, endogenous EP receptors that may be expressed in HEK cells contributed very little to the accumulation of inositol phosphates following treatment with PGE2. We have shown previously that treatment of cells expressing either the FPA and FPB prostanoid receptor isoforms with PGF2α leads to Rho-mediated changes in cellular morphology consisting of the retraction of filopodia, cell rounding, and the formation of cell aggregates (3Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Following the removal of PGF2α, FPA-expressing cells will return to their original morphology after ∼1 h, whereas FPB-expressing cells maintain the rounded phenotype even after 24 h (4Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To see if PGE2 elicited similar effects, untransfected HEK cells and cells expressing either the FPA or FPB prostanoid receptors were treated with either 1 μm PGF2α or 1 μm PGE2 for 1 h after which they were washed and placed in fresh media. The top half of Fig. 2 shows the appearance of untransfected HEK cells and FPA- and FPB-expressing cells by phase-contrast microscopy after the initial 1 h treatment. As can be seen in the panels on the left, treatment of untransfected HEK cells with either PGF2α (panels a and b) or PGE2 (panels e and f) had no obvious effects on cell morphology. However, treatment of FPA-expressing cells (panels a and b, center) and FPB-expressing cells (panels a and b, right) with PGF2α resulted in cell rounding, the formation of cell aggregates, and a loss of filopodia. Treatment of FPA-expressing cells (panels e and f, center) and FPB-expressing cells (panels e and f, right) with PGE2 also produced cell rounding, the formation of cell aggregates, and a loss of filopodia that was virtually indistinguishable from the effects of PGF2α. The bottom half of Fig. 2 shows the appearance of cells 1 h after the removal of either PGF2α or PGE2. Panels c and g show that treatment of cells with vehicle followed by the washout procedure itself had no effect on the morphologic appearance of the cells. Thus, both the untransfected HEK cells and the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells maintained their original morphology (compare with panels a and e). For cells expressing the FPA isoform a comparison of panels c and g with panels d and h shows that following the removal of PGF2α or PGE2 there is a return to the original morphology (compare also with panels a and e). On the other hand, for cells expressing the FPB isoform a comparison of panels c and g with panels d and h shows that following the removal of PGF2α the cells still remain rounded and lack filopodia (panel d), whereas for cells initially treated with PGE2 there is a return to the original morphology (panel h). Thus, the effects of PGE2 in FPB-expressing cells differ from those of PGF2α in that the changes in cell morphology are reversible. PGF2α-induced changes in cell morphology can be blocked by pretreatment of the cells with C3 toxin, a specific inhibitor of Rho (3Pierce K.L. Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35944-35949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). C3 toxin also inhibits the selective activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by the FPB isoform. We have hypothesized that the persistent PGF2α-induced shape change in FPB-expressing cells may be a requirement for activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling (6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Fujino H. Regan J.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 335-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, cell rounding and aggregation can be induced in FPB-expressing cells by treatment with lysophosphatidic acid via endogenous receptors, but these effects are reversible and do not activate Tcf/β-catenin signaling (4Fujino H. Pierce K.L. Srinivasan D. Protzman C.E. Krauss A.H. Woodward D.F. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29907-29914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Fujino H. Srinivasan D. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48786-48795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used a Tcf responsive luciferase reporter gene to investigate the potential activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by PGE2 in FPB-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 3A neither PGF2α nor PGE2 had much effect on the activation of Tcf-responsive reporter gene activity in FPA-expressing cells. In contrast, PGF2α produced a marked stimulation of reporter gene activity in FPB-expressing cells, whereas the stimulation produced by PGE2 was much lower. It is noted that 1 μm PGE2 produced nearly the same levels of total inositol phosphates formation as PGF2α in FPB-expressing cells (Fig. 1). This suggests that relative to PGF2α, PGE2 is a full agonist with respect to the stimulation of inositol phosphates formation but only a partial agonist with respect to stimulation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling. Given that both PGF2α and PGE2 are frequently up-regulated in cancer and that they can both interact with the FP receptor isoforms, we were interested in the possibility that PGE2 could selectively modulate the actions of PGF2α on the Tcf/β-catenin signaling pathway. Prior to examining this, however, we first determined the dose-response relationship for the activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by PGF2α. Fig. 3B shows PGF2α dose-response curves for the activation of Tcf responsive luciferase reporter gene activity in cells expressing either the FPA or FPB receptor isoforms. It can be appreciated that the maximal activation of luciferase activity in FPA-expressing cells was only a fraction of that obtained in FPB-expressing cells and that maximal levels of activation were achieved with 1 μm concentrations in both cell lines. The EC50 value for the activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by PGF2α in cells expressing the FPB isoform was 9.6 nm. Therefore, a concentration of 10 nm PGF2α was used for the experiments depicted in Fig. 4 that required the use of a submaximally stimulating dose of PGF2α. In Fig. 4 the potential of PGE2 to modulate the signaling activity of PGF2α was examined in both FPA- and FPB-expressing cells with respect to both the activation of Tcf-responsive reporter gene activity (upper panels) and total inositol phosphates formation (lower panels). To examine this, cells were pretreated for 15 min with concentrations of PGE2 ranging from 0 to 10–5m. The cells were then washed extensively and stimulated with either vehicle (closed circles) or 10 nm PGF2α (open circles). Again, as in Fig. 3 there were negligible effects of PGF2α on the activation of luciferase activity in FPA-expressing cells (top left panel). In FPA-expressing cells, in the absence of pretreatment with PGE2 (0 PGE2) stimulation with 10 nm PGF2α increased total inositol phosphates formation by ∼250% (bottom left panel). Pretreatment of FPA-expressing cells with 10–9 to 10–7m PGE2 had little effect on the stimulation of inositol phosphates formation by PGF2α and at concentrations of PGE2 above 10–7m the formation of inositol phosphates was increased because of activation of the receptor by PGE2 itself. On the other hand, Fig. 4 shows that in FPB-expressing cells the effects of pretreatment with PGE2 on PGF2α-activated signaling were markedly different depending upon the second messenger pathway being examined. Thus, in the absence of pretreatment with PGE2 (0 PGE2), 10 nm PGF2α stimulated Tcf-responsive luciferase activity ∼300% and as the concentration of PGE2 was increased there was a marked inhibition of PGF2α-stimulated luciferase activity (top right panel). This inhibition of luciferase activity leveled off at pretreatment concentration of ∼10–6m PGE2, at which concentration the amount of luciferase activity was equal to that obtained by PGE2 itself (closed circles). The EC50 for PGE2 with respect to the inhibition of PGF2α-stimulated Tcf signaling was 98 nm, which is comparable with its EC50 for the stimulation of inositol phosphates formation (117 nm, Fig. 1) suggesting that the effects of PGE2 are mediated by direct interactions with the FPB receptor. Pretreatment of FPB-expressing cells with PGE2, however, did not inhibit the stimulation of inositol phosphates formation by 10 nm PGF2α (bottom right panel); thus, the pattern of activity was very similar to that observed in FPA-expressing cells. It has been found in a number of studies that aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as selective COX-2 inhibitors, can attenuate the size and number of colon adenomas (11Marnett L.J. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These effects are presumably mediated through the inhibition of PG synthesis, although other mechanisms have been proposed (11Marnett L.J. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In support of a mechanism involving the PGs and their receptors is evidence from gene knock-out studies that implicate EP2 and EP4 receptors in various mouse models of colon cancer (15Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 16Kobayashi T. Narumiya S. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 557-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, we have suggested the possible involvement of an FPB- or FPB-like receptor as a factor in the development of colorectal cancer by virtue of its ability to activate the Tcf/β-catenin signaling pathway (5Fujino H. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12489-12492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is well established that there is an elevated expression of COX-2 and increased concentrations of PGE2 and PGF2α in a variety of human cancers (7Srivastava S. Verma M. Henson D.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1118-1126PubMed Google Scholar, 9Oka M. Inaba A. Uchiyama T. Hazama S. Shimoda K. Suzuki M. Suzuki T. Am. J. Surg. 1994; 167: 264-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 10Pugh S. Thomas G. Gut. 1994; 35: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Marnett L.J. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). PGE2 and PGF2α are structurally identical except at the C-9 position in the cyclopentane ring where PGE2 has a keto substituent and PGF2α has a hydroxyl. It is not unexpected, therefore, that there is some degree of cross-reactivity for PGE2 to activate FP receptors and for PGF2α to activate EP receptors (17Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). For example, based on radioligand binding PGE2 is only about 30-fold less potent than PGF2α at the human FP receptor (IC50 values of 85 nm and 2.8 nm, respectively) (18Abramovitz M. Boie Y. Nguyen T. Rushmore T.H. Bayne M.A. Metters K.M. Slipetz D.M. Grygorczyk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2632-2636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we explored the interactions of PGF2α and PGE2 with the ovine FPA and FPB alternative mRNA splice variants. We found that in cells expressing the FPB isoform PGE2 can markedly inhibit PGF2α stimulation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling without affecting PGF2α stimulation of total inositol phosphates formation. These findings indicate that the relative composition of PGs in a tissue could be significant with respect to the activation of specific signal transduction cascades by a given prostanoid receptor subtype and its cognate ligand. These data also lend support to thoughts about the influence of the chemical structure of agonists as it concerns the relative dominance of different conformational states of the receptor that are required for the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways (19Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 232-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The most straight forward interpretation of our data with respect to the differential activation of inositol phosphates signaling as compared with Tcf/β-catenin signaling is the concept that PGF2α and PGE2 differ simply in terms of their relative strength to generate an initial signal by the FPB receptor. This interpretation does not require that the FPB receptor couple to different G-proteins with respect to the activation of these two signaling pathways, but we would assume this to be the case. Therefore, although it has not been specifically verified experimentally, it is likely that coupling to the inositol phosphates pathway is through the Gq/11 family of G-proteins and that coupling to Tcf/β-catenin signaling is through G12/13 family of G-proteins. Under these circumstances differences in initial signal strength arise from differences in the efficacy of PGF2α or PGE2 to cause activation of either the Gq/11 or G12/13 family of G-proteins. Thus, PGF2α appears to have higher efficacy for the activation of both families of G-proteins, whereas PGE2 has lower efficacy and preferentially promotes activation of the most efficiently coupled family of G-proteins, i.e. Gq/11. The apparent antagonist activity of PGE2 on PGF2α-mediated Tcf/β-catenin signaling by the FPB isoform, however, is harder to explain by simple differences in the strength of signaling. To explain this, it is possible that stimulation of the FPB receptor by PGF2α results in selective trafficking (e.g. ternary complex formation) of the FPB receptor to both the Gq/11 and G12/13 families of G-proteins. On the other hand, stimulation of the FPB receptor by PGE2 primarily directs the receptor to the Gq/11 family of G-proteins. However, because PGE2 acts as a very weak partial agonist on the Tcf/β-catenin pathway, it is capable of causing a functional antagonism with respect to the ability of PGF2α to promote ternary complex formation of the FPB receptor with the G12/13 family of G-proteins. One additional possibility is that our findings could be explained by the activation of an endogenous EP receptor, which in the presence of FPB receptor overexpression could give rise to a unique PGE2 response, possibly through receptor heterodimerization. We believe this is unlikely for several reasons. First, the data in Fig. 2 show that in untransfected HEK cells there is no cell rounding response to treatment with either 1 μm PGF2α or PGE2, so if there are endogenous FP or EP receptors, stimulation of these receptors alone is not sufficient to cause changes in cell morphology. Second we have done radioligand binding with [3H]PGE2 and have examined PGE2-stimulated cAMP formation in untransfected HEK cells (20Fujino H. West K.A. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and in both cases there is little evidence for any significant response resulting from presence of an endogenous EP receptor. We are aware, however, of anecdotal reports of a PGE2-induced cAMP response in some lines of HEK cells, possibly through an EP4 receptor; although, as noted above we have no conclusive evidence of this in the cells that we have been using. Nevertheless, as additional control we repeated the experiments depicted in Fig. 2 with 1-hydroxy-PGE1, an agonist that is relatively selective for the EP4 receptor as compared with the FP receptor (21Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T. Hirata M. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Treatment of untransfected HEK cells and HEK cells expressing either the FPA or FPB receptors with 1 μm 1-hydroxy-PGE1 for 1 h at 37 °C did not cause any obvious changes in cell morphology as compared with treatment with vehicle alone (data not shown). In this same experiment treatment with 1 μm PGF2α caused cell rounding, aggregation, and loss of filopodia in the FPA- and FPB-expressing cells but not in the untransfected HEK cells. Thus, it would appear that potential interactions of PGE2 with endogenous EP receptors would be unlikely to account for the effects of PGE2 that we have observed in this study. Down-regulation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling has been associated with the differentiation of Caco-2 cells, a tissue culture cell line derived from human colonic carcinoma (22Mariadason J.M. Bordonaro M. Aslam F. Shi L. Kuraguchi M. Velcich A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3465-3471PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling has also been associated with the transition of colorectal carcinoma cells in situ from a mesenchymal-like state to an epithelial-like state (23Brabletz T. Jung A. Reu S. Porzner M. Hlubek F. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Knuechel R. Kirchner T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Thus, well differentiated colorectal carcinomas are characterized as having two populations of cells. One population consists of differentiated epithelial-like cells with higher proliferative activity that is localized to central areas of the primary tumor and metastases. A second population consists of mesenchymal-like cells with lower proliferative activity that is localized to the invasive front of the tumor and to disseminated cells at metastatic sites. It appears that the tumor cells can undergo reversible transitions between these two states, which is somewhat at odds with a linear model of tumor progression in which the transition to a mesenchymal-like state is fixed by genetic changes (23Brabletz T. Jung A. Reu S. Porzner M. Hlubek F. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Knuechel R. Kirchner T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). For example, colorectal carcinoma cells at the invasive front appear to dedifferentiate from an epithelial-like state to a mesenchymal-like state that is associated with increased metastatic potential and characterized by increased dissociation and migration. Following metastasis there appears to be redifferentiation and return to the epithelial-like condition. The epithelial-like condition is associated with decreased nuclear Tcf-β-catenin signaling, whereas the opposite is true for the mesenchymal-like state (23Brabletz T. Jung A. Reu S. Porzner M. Hlubek F. Kunz-Schughart L.A. Knuechel R. Kirchner T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). It is believed that the regulation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling is influenced by the tumor environment, but the specific factors regulating this are not understood. Our present findings suggest a mechanism by which the local tumor environment could alter cell signaling in the absence of transcriptional or post-transcriptional changes either in the expression of the receptors or its downstream signaling components. Thus, by relatively rapid changes in the activity of the PG biosynthetic enzymes it would be possible to change the levels of various PGs in a tissue and thereby potentially change the patterns of cell signaling. Using the FPB receptor as an example, the extent of activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling by a fixed concentration of PGF2α can be significantly reduced in the presence of PGE2 as compared with its absence. If a similar mechanism were to operate in colorectal carcinoma tumor cells, one might expect the epithelial-like condition to be associated with a relatively higher ratio of PGE2 to PGF2α that would result in decreased Tcf/β-catenin signaling. On the other hand, a decreased ratio of PGE2 to PGF2α would lead to the activation of Tcf/β-catenin signaling and the possible transition to a mesenchymal-like state. Clearly additional work will be needed to test whether such a mechanism might explain the effect of the local tumor environment on the phenotypic expression of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2031150275,"Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) consists of two identical subunits that induce the cross-subunit binding mode of tRNATrp. It has been shown that eubacterial and eukaryotic TrpRSs cannot efficiently cross-aminoacylate the corresponding tRNATrp. Although the identity elements in tRNATrp that confer the species-specific recognition have been identified, the corresponding elements in TrpRS have not yet been reported. In this study two residues, Lys-149 and Glu-153, were identified as being crucial for the accurate recognition of tRNATrp. These residues reside adjacent to the binding pocket for Trp-AMP and show phylogenic diversities in the charge on their side chains between eubacteria and eukaryotes. Single mutagenesis at Lys-149 or Glu-153 reduced the activity of TrpRS in the activation of Trp. The reduction was less than that caused by the double mutant WBHA (K149D/E153R). It is unusual that E153G had no detectable activity in the activation of Trp unless tRNATrp was added to the reaction. In addition, we successfully switched the species specificity of Bacillus subtilis TrpRS recognition of tRNATrp. The affinity of WBHA, K149E and E153K to human tRNATrp was 31-, 13.5-, and 12.9-fold greater than that of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS, respectively. Indeed WBHA and E153K were found to prefer genuine human tRNATrp to their cognate eubacteria tRNATrp.

Indeed WBHA and E153K were found to prefer genuine human tRNATrp to their cognate eubacteria tRNATrp. The evolutionary independence of eubacteria and eukaryotes ensured the diversity of these kingdoms. Each kingdom had its own synthetic and metabolic systems that precluded its invasion by the other life form. The process of protein synthesis emerged early in evolution. It translates the genetic information of a species and is an ideal system for investigating phylogenic diversity. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, one of the most important enzymes in protein synthesis, catalyzes aminoacylation of its cognate tRNA. The activated tRNA carries its amino acid to the ribosome where it is added to the growing peptide chain. Most eubacterial and eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases cannot efficiently cross-aminoacylate the tRNA from the other species. The substrates in an aminoacylation reaction include amino acids, ATP, and tRNA. Because the 20 amino acids are identical in eubacteria and eukaryotes, the species specificity of the aminoacylation reaction is ensured and regulated by specificities residing in tRNA and/or the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The identity elements in tRNA have been determined to be crucial for species-specific recognition of tRNA (1McClain W.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 257-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.N. Science. 1994; 263: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3Francklyn C.

Based on their contributions to aminoacylation, they have been divided into major and minor elements (5Crothers D.M. Seno T. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous work established detailed kinetic data for the identity elements in tRNATrp.In Bacillus subtilis tRNATrp, discriminator G73 and anticodon CCA are major elements whereas A1-U72, G5-C68, and A9 are minor elements. When G73 was mutated to A73, the mutant tRNATrp preferred yeast TrpRS 1The abbreviation used is: RS, tRNA synthetase. to its cognate eubacterial TrpRS (8Xue H. Shen W. Giegé R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the identity elements are found mainly in the acceptor-stem of the tRNA, this implies that the acceptor-stem is an operational “RNA code” even older than the anticodon. Exchanges of identity elements between B. subtilis tRNATrp and human tRNATrp showed that all of the identity elements contribute to the species-specific aminoacylation of tRNATrp by TrpRS (9Xu F. Chen X. Xin L. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Eubacterial TrpRS seems to be more sensitive than eukaryotic TrpRS to changes in the identity elements of tRNATrp. In a recent SELEX experiment, an aptamer containing three G-C base pairs mimicking G2-C71, G3-C70, and G4-C69 in B. subtilis tRNATrp showed high affinity to B. subtilis TrpRS (10Xu F. Jiang G. Li W. He X. Ji Y. Wang D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8087-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This result supports the hypothesis that the sequences and structures of the tRNA acceptor-stem were crucial for the operational RNA (4Francklyn C. Shi J.P. Schimmel P. Science. 1992; 255: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These data also suggest that TrpRS may co-evolve with tRNATrp to adapt itself to changes in the operational RNA code for tryptophan. There is little enzymatic data available to support the suggestion that TrpRS contains the corresponding residues that recognize the identity elements in tRNATrp. However, this suggestion is supported and promoted by the recently disclosed crystal structure of the TyrRS-tRNA complexes (11Wakasugi K. Quinn C.L. Tao N. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Ilyin V.A. Temple B. Hu M. Li G. Yin Y. Vachette P. Carter Jr., C.W.

Biol. 2003; 10: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because of similar conformational and catalytic characteristics, both TrpRS and TyrRS were assigned to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase class Ic (15Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Despite considerable differences in their amino acid sequences, the tertiary structures of TrpRS and TyrRS exhibit unexpected homologies in their catalytic domains and substrate binding pockets (16Doublié S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter Jr., C.W. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Both TrpRS and TyrRS consist of two identical subunits. When the acceptorstem of the tRNA binds to the catalytic center in one subunit, the anticodon loop simultaneously binds to the C-terminal domain in the other subunit (17Ibba M. Sever S. Praetorius-Ibba M. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3631-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Guez V. Nair S. Chaffotte A. Bedouelle H.

The acceptor-stem binding domain is near the aminoacyl-AMP pocket (13Yaremchuk A. Kriklivyi I. Tukalo M. Cusack S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3829-3840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 14Kobayashi T. Nureki O. Ishitani R. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. Cusack S. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activated amino acid is carried conveniently to the 2′-OH of adenosine in the CCA terminus in tRNA. Those residues that interact with the identity elements of tRNATyr have also been identified in TyrRSs. They belong to two α helices that are located adjacent to the tyrosine pocket. The helices form a groove to accept the acceptor-stem of the tRNATyr. These findings have promoted ongoing research on B. subtilis TrpRS and are in agreement with our findings (20Jia J. Xu F. Chen X. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 749-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B. subtilis TrpRS is a small protein with a molecular weight of 77,000 (21Xu Z. Love M.L. Ma L.Y. Blum M.

As is true of TyrRS, a Rossmann fold containing the conserved sequences HIGH and KMSKS forms its catalytic domain. A series of crystal structures of TrpRS have been solved recently, but the data for the structure of TrpRS-tRNATrp remains unavailable (22Retailleau P. Huang X. Yin Y. Hu M. Weinreb V. Vachette P.

Our previous study identified residues 108–122 and 234–238 as being crucial for recognition of the acceptor-stem and the anticodon loop of tRNATrp, respectively (20Jia J. Xu F. Chen X. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 749-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this research, we have further investigated the recognition mode of the acceptor-stem by B. subtilis TrpRS. By sequence and structural homology analysis, residues Lys-149 and Glu-153 exhibit phylogenic diversities that might have co-evolved with the identity elements in tRNATrp in both eubacteria and eukaryotes. Kinetic data obtained with mutant enzymes also revealed the importance of these two residues for species-specific recognition of tRNATrp. Strains, Plasmids, and Reagents—Escherichia coli strain JM109 and BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), respectively.

After confirmation by DNA sequencing, the correctly mutated trpS genes were cloned into a high level expression system (28Shi W. Chow K.C. Wong J.T. Biochem.

The constructed strains were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 0.1 mm to overexpress TrpRS proteins in a soluble form.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Purified TrpRSs were stored at –80 °C until use. Purification of the tRNATrp Transcripts in Vitro—Genes for B. subtilis tRNATrp and human tRNATrp were synthesized with a Beckmann DNA synthesizer in our laboratory. The transcription template was amplified by PCR and then digested with BstOI to yield the CCA end (20Jia J. Xu F. Chen X. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 749-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent transcription was performed according to the instructions of the RiboMAX Large-scale RNA production system-T7. The tRNATrp transcript was purified by 10% PAGE containing 8 m urea. Before the aminoacylation assay, tRNATrp was denatured in boiling water for 5 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. Kinetic Analysis of Trp Activation—The assay was carried out as reported previously (31Jørgensen R. Søgaard T.M.M. Rossing A.B. Martensen P.M. Justesen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The final reaction concentration of TrpRS was 0.1 μm. Other components included 4 mm ATP, 0.02 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm KF, 0.02% gelatin, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm l-Trp, and 4 mm pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate and TrpRS were added last to initiate the reaction. The sample was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and rapidly cooled to 0 °C to stop the reaction. 3 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted on polyethyleneimine and developed with 1 m KH2PO4 for the final calculation. When the concentration of Trp was changed, ATP was kept at 4 mm. Conversely, when the concentration of ATP was changed, Trp was held constant at 2 mm. For all kinetic assays, the concentration of substrate was changed at least 10-fold. Each reaction was repeated at least four times under the same conditions. The data were fitted to a hyperbola by non-linear regression to yield Km and kcat. Kinetic Determination of Trp Activation in the Presence of tRNATrp— Because the catalytic behaviors of WBHA, E153K, and E153G seemed different to that of wild type TrpRS in Trp activation, the kinetic data for these enzymes were further investigated in the presence of tRNATrp. The assay and components for the reaction were identical to those mentioned above, except for inactivated tRNATrp. Inactivated tRNATrp transcripts were produced by oxidation with NaIO4 for 1 h. The oxidization blocked both the 2′-OH and 3′-OH of adenosine in the CCA terminus, and the inactivated tRNATrp was unable to accept the activated Trp. The inactivated tRNATrp was incubated with TrpRS before it was added to the reaction. The concentration of the inactivated tRNATrp at 8 μm was 80-fold higher than that of TrpRS. The determined data were obtained for Trp activation but not for tRNATrp aminoacylation in the presence of the inactivated tRNATrp. Aminoacylation Assay—Recognition of tRNATrp by B. subtilis TrpRS or its mutants was determined at 22 °C (20Jia J. Xu F. Chen X. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 749-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction buffer consisted of 8 mm ATP, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 μCi of l-[5-3H]Trp, 8 mm MgCl2, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.02 μm tRNATrp in a total volume of 50 μl. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched in ice. 20-μl aliquots were spotted onto Whatmann 3-mm filter discs. These discs were washed three times with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.05% tryptophan and then with 95% ethanol; then the discs were dried and transferred to vials for determination of radioactive counts. One unit of aminoacylation activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to charge 1 pmol of tRNATrp per minute under the assay conditions. For all kinetic assays, the concentration of tRNATrp varied from 0.02 μm to 1.28 μm; [Trp] was constant at 8 μm. Each reaction was repeated at least four times under the same conditions. kcat/Km for aminoacylation was calculated from Eadie-Hofstee plots. All data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Charges on Two Residues Display Phylogenic Diversities— Two residues in the αE helix of B. subtilis TrpRS have charges opposite to those on the corresponding TrpRS residues in Archaea and eukaryotes (Fig. 1). Lys-149 is a positively charged residue, whereas the corresponding residue in Archaea and eukaryotes is aspartic acid, a negatively charged residue. The residue in both Archaea and eukaryotes corresponding to Glu-153 is arginine, a negatively charged residue. Although the first site showed some changes in mitochondria, the second site in mitochondria was identical to that in eubacteria. Mitochondrial TrpRS is more homologous to eubacteria TrpRS than to eukaryotic TrpRS. Such an evolutionary relationship is also found in other conserved regions, such as HXGH and KMSKS (31Jørgensen R. Søgaard T.M.M. Rossing A.B. Martensen P.M. Justesen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16820-16826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the α9 helix in Methanococcus jannaschii TyrRS and the α11 helix in Thermus thermophilus TyrRS are involved in recognition of the acceptor-stem of tRNATyr. Because the αE helix in TrpRS is homologous to these helices and is located adjacent to the Trp binding pocket, it might be involved in the binding of tRNATrp to TrpRS. Crystal structures of TrpRS indicated that GXDQ was involved in Trp binding and acyl transfer (12Ilyin V.A. Temple B. Hu M. Li G. Yin Y. Vachette P. Carter Jr., C.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Doublié S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter Jr., C.W. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). If tRNATrp is recognized by the αE helix, it could easily promote acyl group transfer to the acceptor-stem of tRNATrp. Furthermore, the diversity of these residues seemed to correspond to those of the identity elements of tRNATrp (9Xu F. Chen X. Xin L. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore several mutants were constructed to further investigate the role of Lys-149 and Glu-153 in tRNATrp recognition. Kinetic Parameters for TrpRS Mutants in Trp Activation—To understand the importance of Lys-149 and Glu-153 in the first-step reaction, Km and kcat values were determined for 7 TrpRSs mutants (Table I). WBHA was a double mutant in which Lys-149 and Glu-153 were substituted by Asp-149 and Arg-153, the corresponding residues in human TrpRS. This mutant was designed to insert eukaryotic genetic information into eubacterial TrpRS. Although the conformation of the Trp binding pockets seems similar in different TrpRSs, recent data show that the residues in the Trp pocket vary somewhat between eubacteria and eukaryotes (23Yu Y.

When the affinity of TrpRSs to Trp and ATP was determined, kcat/Km ratios of WBHA were about 10- and 3.4-fold less than that of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS, respectively. The activity of WBHA was the least among all those determined. Km showed the largest change among the kinetic constants for Trp. The increased Km for Trp confirmed that this change resulted in less efficient Trp binding. On the other hand, it supported the idea expressed previously that recognition of Trp differs from eubacteria to eukaryotes.Table IKinetic data for Lys-149 and Glu-153 mutants in activation of TrpEnzymeATPaWhen [ATP] varied from 100-4000 μm, [Trp] was constant at 2 mm.

Open table in a new tab When Lys-149 was mutated to Arg-149, Glu-149, and Gly-149, the kcat/Km values of these mutants implied that residue Lys-149 contributed little to the binding of the substrate Trp. The largest loss in activity was –1.1-fold that was observed in the affinity of K149G to Trp. K149R showed the greatest increase in the affinity to ATP with a range of about 1.1-fold. In contrast to those of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS, the activities of the mutant K149X varied only from –1.1-fold to 1.1-fold. The crystal structures of TrpRS and the TrpRS-Trp-AMP complex showed that Lys-149 does not directly interact with Trp. Glu-153 is located in the second circle of the αE helix. Although this location is farther from GXDQ than the distance between Lys-149 and GXDQ, Glu-153 seemed to have a greater effect on Trp activation. Kinetic data show that changes in charge on Glu-153 induced notable increases in Vmax and reduced the affinity of TrpRS for the substrates Trp and ATP. The Vmax of E153K was 19-fold higher, and the Km values of E153K for Trp and ATP were 27- and 24-fold higher, respectively, than those of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS. The resulting effect caused by changes of both Vmax and Km was indeed a partial reduction in the activities of E153K. It is shown that activation of Trp must depend on the polarity of the side chain of Glu-153. When Glu-153 was replaced by Gly-153, the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction was too slow to be detected by polyethyleneimine-cellulose chromatography even if the concentration of E153G TrpRS was increased 1000-fold above the normal range. E153G, however, had aminoacylation activity in the recognition of tRNATrp (Table II), and it is possible that binding of tRNA helped induce the conformation required for Trp recognition. These observations were consistent with the findings in other class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in which activation of the amino acid did not occur without the help of tRNA (33Eriani G. Dirheimer G.

Each assay was repeated four times. Open table in a new tab Mutants Reduced the Efficiency of the Cognate tRNATrp Aminoacylation—Similar to the changes shown in the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction, Glu-153 was more important to the tRNATrp recognition than Lys-149. When the charge of Glu-153 was changed to opposite or non-polarity, the activities of E153K and E153G were greatly reduced. In regard to the affinity to B. subtilis tRNATrp, E153K and E153G were decreased by –37-fold and –48-fold, respectively (Table II). In all mutants, the double mutant WBHA showed the least activity in the aminoacylation of tRNATrp. The affinity of WBHA to the tRNATrp was only 1% of that of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS. This reduction seemed to be caused by a slower reaction velocity. The kcat of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS was 0.707 s–1; however, that of WHBA was just 0.016 s–1. The Km of WHBA was 1.26 μm, which was about two times higher than the Km of wild type B. subtilis TrpRS. The activities of other single mutants decreased between –1.3-fold to –3.1-fold. From the kinetic data, the preference of B. subtilis tRNATrp was as follows: Lys-149/Glu-153 > Lys-149/Asp-153 > Arg-149/Glu-153 > Gly-149/Glu-153 > Glu-149/Glu-153 > Lys-149/Lys-153 > Lys-149/Gly-153 > Asp-149/Arg-153. This result was in agreement with the phylogenic diversities in the actual TrpRSs. The residue corresponding to Lys-149 had more types that could aminoacylate its cognate tRNATrp efficiently. tRNATrp Molecule Is Helpful for TrpRS to Catalyze Trp Activation—Can the activities of WBHA, E153K, and E153G for Trp activation be recovered with the help of tRNATrp?
