https://openalex.org/W2072489714,"Freshwater members of the phylum Gastrotricha have been considered obligate parthenogens. In Lepidodermelia squammata, the species for which there is most evidence for parthenogenesis, sperm have been discovered. This finding will necessitate reexamination of the nature of sexuality and life cycles and of the concept of ""species"" in freshwater gastrotrichs."
https://openalex.org/W2090933231,Forbidden emission from singly ionized oxygen at wavelengths of 3726 and 3729 angstroms has been detected in the inner Jovian magnetosphere. The emission is present between approximately 4 and approximately 7 to 8 Jovian radii from the planet and appears concentrated in the magnetic equator. The line intensity ratio indicates the same plasma characteristics as those derived from observations of forbidden sulfur emission.
