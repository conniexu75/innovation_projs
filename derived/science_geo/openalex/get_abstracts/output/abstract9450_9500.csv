https://openalex.org/W1553335616,"The distribution of bacterial leucine dehydrogenase (L-leucine:NAD+ oxidoreductase, deaminating, EC 1.4.1.9) was investigated, and Bacillus sphaericus (IFO 3525) was found to have the highest activity of the enzyme. Leucine dehydrogenase, which was purified to homogeneity and crystallized from B. sphaericus, has a molecular weight of about 245,000 and consists of six identical subunits (Mr = 41,000). The enzyme catalyzes the oxidative deamination of L-leucine, L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-norvaline, L-alpha-aminobutyrate, and L-norleucine, and the reductive amination of their keto analogues. The enzyme requires NAD+ as a cofactor, which cannot be replaced by NADP+. D-Enantiomers of the substrate amino acids inhibit competitively the oxidation of L-leucine. The enzyme activity is significantly reduced by both sulfhydryl reagents and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Purine and pyrimidine bases, nucleosides and nucleotides have no effect on the enzyme activity. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies show that the reductive amination proceeds through a sequential ordered ternary-binary mechanism. NADH binds first to the enzyme followed by alpha-ketoisocaproate and ammonia, and the products are released in the order of L-leucine and NAD+. The Michaelis constants are as follows: L-leucine (1 mM), NAD+ (0.39 mM), NADH (35 micrometer), alpha-ketoisocaproate (0.31 mM), and ammonia (0.2 M). The pro-S hydrogen at C-4 of the dihydronicotinamide ring of NADH is exclusively transferred to the substrate; the enzyme is B-stereospecific."

https://openalex.org/W1504672937,"The mature rat testis contains two forms of adenylate cyclase. One is membrane-bound and hormone-responsive; the other is water-soluble and not activated by hormones (Braun, T., and Dods, R. F. (1976) Pnoc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 1097-1101). The water-soluble adenylate cyclase is a globular protein which is much smaller than the enzyme which is solubilized from membranes of mature rat testis by Triton X-100. Its physical properties are: sedimentation coefficient, 3.8 S; Stokes radius, 34 A; molecular weight, 56,000; frictional ratio, 1.2. Inclusion of protease inhibitors during enzyme extraction did not affect the fraction of total enzyme activity which was water-soluble, nor did autolysis for 1 h at 25 degrees C. The physical properties of the membrane-bound adenylate cyclase were determined after solubilization with Triton X-100. In detergent, the values are: sedimentation coefficient, 6.7 S; Stokes radius, 68 A; partial specific volume, 0.73 ml/g; molecular weight, 191,000; frictional ratio, 1.6. The fact that the partial specific volume of the enzyme in detergent is the same as that of a typical water-soluble protein shows that the Triton X-100-solubilized enzyme does not bind a large quantity of detergent. This indicates that it does not have extensive hydrophobic regions on its surface. The detergent-solubilized adenylate cyclase of the mature rat testis is similar in this respect to adenylate cyclase solubilized from the rat renal medulla (Neer, E. J. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 6527-6531)."
https://openalex.org/W1551460886,"Homogenates of bovine thyroid gland contained the glycosyltransferases required for the in vitro formation of the disialoganglioside N-acetylneuraminylgalactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide (G& and the trisialoganglioside N-acetylneuraminylgalactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-[N-acetylneuraminyl-N-acetylneuraminyl]galactosylglucosylceramide (&lb) from lactosylceramide (GL-2). These enzyme activities were constituted into two separate biosynthetic pathways which culminated in the formation of Gnls and GJTlb, respectively. Based on substrate competition experiments, the last three reactions in each pathway appeared to be catalyzed by the same three glycosyltransferases. These three enzymes as well as CMP-AcNeu:GL-2 sialyltransferase were highly enriched in the Golgi apparatus fraction from bovine thyroid. The reaction product of the latter enzyme is Nacetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide (Gm), the first ganglioside intermediate in both pathways. In contrast, CMP-AcNeu:Gm sialyltransferase, which catalyzes the formation of N-acetylneuraminyl-Nacetylneuraminylgalactosylglucosylceramide (G&, the branch point between the two pathways, was not localized in the Golgi apparatus. Bovine thyroid, which contains a complex pattern of gangliosides, is capable of synthesizing these important membrane constituents. In addition, these results suggest that the separate subcellular localization of Gn3 synthesis may be involved in the regulation of ganglioside biosynthesis by the two pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1574058135,"Studies in the accompanying paper (Chen, W. W., and Lennarz, W. J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5774-5779) showed that hen oviduct membranes catalyze synthesis of a Glc-containing oligosaccharide-lipid and that the oligosaccharide moiety of this compound is transferred en bloc to an endogenous protein as well as to an exogenous, soluble protein. In this study we have established that the endogeneous proteins in oviduct membranes are devoid of Glc. In view of these findings, the possibility that Glc was excised from the oligosaccharide chain after it had been transferred to protein was examined. Kinetic studies involving the use of endogenous membrane proteins as acceptors of the oligosaccharide chain suggested that the Glc residues were released without significant degradation of the core oligosaccharide. Direct evidence for the presence of a membrane-bound glucosidase was obtained using either free, Glc-containing oligosaccharide or Glc-containing oligosaccharide linked to S-carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin as substrates. Experiments utilizing [3H]Glc- and [14C]GlcNAc-labeled, glycosylated S-carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin established that, under conditions leading to extensive removal of [3H]Glc, there was essentially no degradation of the [14C]GlcNAc-labeled oligosaccharide core."

https://openalex.org/W2169726056,"We reported earlier (Schloss, J. V., and Hartman, F. C. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 77, 230-236) that N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate is an affinity label for spinach ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. We now show inactivation to be correlated directly with the alkylation either of a single lysyl residue (in the presence of Mg2+) or of 2 different cysteinyl residues (in the absence of Mg2+), consistent with the likelihood that these residues are located in the active site region. This proposition is further supported by the demonstration that the residues are protected from alkylation by substrate, a competitive inhibitor, or the transition state analog 2-carboxyribitol bisphosphate. Tryptic peptides that contain the modified residues have been isolated and sequenced. One of the 2 cysteinyl residues that are subject to alkylation is only 3 residues distant in sequence from the lysyl residue modified by bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate. This lysyl residue is identical with 1 of the 2 lysyl residues alkylated by the previously described affinity label, 3-bromo-1,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 1,4-bisphosphate (Stringer, C. D., and Hartman, F. C. (1978) Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 80, 1043-1048)."

https://openalex.org/W1597326302,"Ferrous leghemoglobin reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form the stable product, leghemoglobin(IV). The reaction follows second order kinetics (k = 2.24 X 10(4) M-1 S-1 at 20 degrees C) and may be regarded as a single-step, two-electron oxidation. Ferric leghemoglobin is not an intermediate. The oxidation state of leghemoglobin(IV) is established by reductive titration with dithionite; 2 eq of dithionite are required to convert 1 mol of leghemoglobin(IV) to ferrous leghemoglobin. An outstanding property of leghemoglobin(IV) is its stability, little change is noted after 12 h at 25 degrees C. Leghemoglobin(IV) differs from the higher oxidation states of other hemoglobins and myoglobins in that it does not react with hydrogen peroxide to form the oxygenated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1580880167,"Earlier studies on the biosynthesis of an oligosaccharide-lipid with the structure (alpha-Man)4-6-beta-Man-(1 leads to 4)-beta-GlcNAc-(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol have been extended to show that enzymes in membrane preparations of hen oviduct catalyze synthesis of a Glc-containing oligosaccharide-lipid that is similar in properties to the Glc-free oligosaccharide-lipid. Conditions that enable enzymatic preparation of Man-, GlcNAc-, or Glc-labeled oligosaccharide-lipid have been established. Experiments with isolated [Glc-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid as substrate demonstrated that the oligosaccharide chain was transferred en bloc from the lipid to an endogenous membrane protein of apparent Mr = 25,000. In addition, an exogenous soluble protein, S-carboxymethylated alpha-lactalbumin, was shown to serve as acceptor of the oligosaccharide chain from the Glc-containing oligosaccharide-lipid. Studies on the metabolic fate of the Glc residues in these proteins are reported in the accompanying paper (Chen, W. W., and Lennarz, W. J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5780-5785)."
https://openalex.org/W193844216,"Mucus secreted from the skin of a marine worm, Cerebratulus lacteus, contains a family of polypeptide cytotoxins (A toxins) in addition to the previously reported polypeptide neurotoxins (B toxins). The A toxins were purified by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and then CM-cellulose gradient chromatography at pH 7.5 and pH 3.5. The three most abundant A toxins (designated according to their order of CM-cellulose elution) were homogeneous by gel electrophoreses, amino acid composition, and by NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal partial sequence analyses. Each of the three A toxins consists of a single basic polypeptide chain of 93 to 99 residues, cross-linked by three or four disulfide bonds, lacking reducing sugar and cysteinyl residues. The three A toxins rapidly lysed human red cells and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells at 1 to 10 microgram/ml concentrations. On a molar basis toxin A-III is about 4 times more active than melittin (bee venom lysin) and over 10 times more active than cardiotoxin (elapid snake lysin) upon human red cells. Purified A toxins lacked phospholipase A activity. The cytoxins as well as the neurotoxins were concentrated within the body wall integument."

https://openalex.org/W1542183155,"Abstract The DNA content of mature rat liver parenchymal cells falls into three distinct classes with 1:2:4 amounts of DNA. These classes represent 2 N, 4 N, and 8 N cells. We have measured the changing proportions of these cells from 0.75 to 24 months of age. We have obtained a useful approximation for the numbers of each ploidy class, for cellular preparations from liver, as a function of the amount of DNA and age. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the average DNA content per cell is given by the relationship DNA/cell = 41.28(1/2)--324.14 Age1/4 + 499.37 Age1/8--207.24, with a multiple correlation coefficient of 0.990. Measurements of the amount of RNA synthesized in a 15-min period revealed that the relative proportions were 1.2:1.0 for 4 N:2 N cells of young rats, 1.3:1.1.:1.0 for 8 N:4 N:2 N cells of intermediate ages, and 1.1:1.0 for 8 N:4 N cells of old rats. The absolute amounts of RNA synthesized by each ploidy class declined with age."

https://openalex.org/W1647827935,"The amino acid sequence of hemerythrin from the sipunculid worm, Themiste dyscritum, was determined by sequenator analyses of the S-pyridylethylated protein and fragments derived by further chemical and enzymatic cleavages. The fragments were obtained by cleavage of the intact protein with hydroxylamine, trypsin digestion of citraconylated intact protein, and subdigestion with Staphylococcal protease V8. The COOH-terminal sequence was determined using carboxypeptidases A and B and amino acid analyses. The polypeptide chain was found to contain 113 amino acids. Since heterogeneity was observed at no more than two positions in the amino acid sequence, the native octameric protein appears to be composed of identical subunits. By combining information derived from sequence analyses and x-ray crystallographic studies, it has been possible to identify amino acids responsible for the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein as well as amino acids serving as iron ligands at the oxygen-binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1558506650,"Chicken reticulocyte (polychromatic primitive erythrocyte) and erythrocyte chromatin was fractionated by ultrasound shearing and salt precipitation into three fractions differing in their activities to support the in vitro RNA synthesis. The transcriptionally active fraction of chicken reticulocyte chromatin which represented only about 0.5% of the total nuclear DNA contained essentially all the chromatin-associated endogenous RNA. Approximately 2% of this endogenous reticulocyte RNA hybridized to globin cDNA probe and could be translated in vitro into polypeptides which coelectrophoresed with the in vitro translation product of isolated chicken globin mRNA or chicken globin marker. Each of the three fractions had a characteristic distribution of chromosomal proteins and endogenous RNA. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the chromosomal proteins showed differences in their distribution among individual fractions of the same cell type and among corresponding fractions of reticulocyte or erythrocyte chromatin. Antisera produced against dehistonized reticulocyte chromatin were specific for reticulocyte but not erythrocyte chromatin. When reacted with each of the differentially templating chromatin fractions, it was found that reticulocyte-specific antibodies were highly reactive with the template-active fraction of reticulocytes, but essentially nonreactive with any other reticulocyte fraction. This same antiserum was not significantly reactive toward any erythrocyte fraction. The antigenicity of the template-active fraction of reticulocytes was abolished after pronase or DNase II digestion, but only partially diminished after DNase I digestion."

https://openalex.org/W202062981,"A corrinoid enzyme has been purified to approximately 80% homogeneity from Clostridium thermoaceticum. It catalyzes the formation of acetate from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate and pyruvate in combination with the required supplementary enzymes which are supplied by an extract that has been treated with propyl iodide. The enzyme was purified by chromatography on a folate affinity column and a DEAE-Bio-Gel column and by ultrafiltration. The molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 158,000 and the sedimentation coefficient is 10.5 S. By gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the subunit molecular weight was found to be 40,000, thus, the enzyme may be a tetramer of four similar subunits. The results of electron microscopy confirmed the tetrameric structure. In the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, two bands of similar intensity were observed by electrophoresis, but both yielded the 40,000 molecular weight subunit in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results indicate the two bands represent either two different molecular weight forms of the enzyme or two differently charged isoenzymes. The enzyme is quite labile being sensitive to dilution, aerobic conditions, and light. Dithiothreitol and glycerol were found to stabilize the enzyme. The cofactor requirements for acetate synthesis have been determined. ATP, thiamin pyrophosphate, S-adenosylmethionine, and Fe2+ were found to be required for maximum activity and the Km values were determined. High concentrations of methyltetrahydrofolate, pyruvate, and S-adenosylmethionine were found to inhibit the synthesis of acetate."
