https://openalex.org/W1993808715,"Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs) play a key role in immunity and disease through their ability to modulate inflammation in response to pathogen-derived and endogenous danger signals. Here, we identify the requirements for activation of NLRP1, an NLR protein associated with a number of human pathologies, including vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn disease. We demonstrate that NLRP1 activity is dependent upon ASC, which associates with the C-terminal CARD domain of NLRP1. In addition, we show that NLRP1 activity is dependent upon autolytic cleavage at Ser(1213) within the FIIND. Importantly, this post translational event is dependent upon the highly conserved distal residue His(1186). A disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphism near His(1186) and a naturally occurring mRNA splice variant lacking exon 14 differentially affect this autolytic processing and subsequent NLRP1 activity. These results describe key molecular pathways that regulate NLRP1 activity and offer insight on how small sequence variations in NLR genes may influence human disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138670140,"Recent in vitro evidence indicates that astrocytes can modulate synaptic plasticity by releasing neuroactive substances (gliotransmitters). However, whether gliotransmitter release from astrocytes is necessary for higher brain function in vivo, particularly for memory, as well as the contribution of connexin (Cx) hemichannels to gliotransmitter release, remain elusive. Here, we microinfused into the rat basolateral amygdala (BLA) TAT-Cx43L2, a peptide that selectively inhibits Cx43-hemichannel opening while maintaining synaptic transmission or interastrocyte gap junctional communication. In vivo blockade of Cx43 hemichannels during memory consolidation induced amnesia for auditory fear conditioning, as assessed 24 h after training, without affecting short-term memory, locomotion, or shock reactivity. The amnesic effect was transitory, specific for memory consolidation, and was confirmed after microinfusion of Gap27, another Cx43-hemichannel blocker. Learning capacity was recovered after coinfusion of TAT-Cx43L2 and a mixture of putative gliotransmitters (glutamate, glutamine, lactate, d-serine, glycine, and ATP). We propose that gliotransmitter release from astrocytes through Cx43 hemichannels is necessary for fear memory consolidation at the BLA. Thus, the present study is the first to demonstrate a physiological role for astroglial Cx43 hemichannels in brain function, making these channels a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2039862342,"The genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 contains three type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) called H1-, H2-, and H3-T6SS. The H1-T6SS secretes three identified toxins that target other bacteria, providing a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa, and likely contributes to bacterial pathogenesis in chronic infections. However, no specific substrates or defined roles have been described for the two other systems. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of H2-T6SS genes of strain PAO1 is up-regulated during the transition from exponential to stationary phase growth and regulated by the Las and Rhl quorum sensing systems. In addition, we identify two putative Fur boxes in the promoter region and find that H2-T6SS transcription is negatively regulated by iron. We also show that the H2-T6SS system enhances bacterial uptake into HeLa cells (75% decrease in internalization with a H2-T6SS mutant) and into lung epithelial cells through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway that induces Akt activation in the host cell (50% decrease in Akt phosphorylation). Finally, we show that H2-T6SS plays a role in P. aeruginosa virulence in the worm model. Thus, in contrast to H1-T6SS, H2-T6SS modulates interaction with eukaryotic host cells. Together, T6SS can carry out different functions that may be important in establishing chronic P. aeruginosa infections in the human host.

Together, T6SS can carry out different functions that may be important in establishing chronic P. aeruginosa infections in the human host. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections in immunocompromised humans and is responsible for chronic respiratory disease of patients with cystic fibrosis. A key factor in P. aeruginosa virulence is its capacity to secrete a wide range of hydrolytic enzymes and toxins to the extracellular medium as well as to inject virulence effectors directly into host cells (1Brencic A.

Substrates for this secretion system were first discovered in Vibrio cholerae by Pukatzki et al. (7Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Sturtevant D. Krastins B. Sarracino D. Nelson W.C. Heidelberg J.F. Mekalanos J.J. Identification of a conserved bacterial protein secretion system in Vibrio cholerae using the Dictyostelium host model system.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that secretion of proteins lacking a signal peptide, such as Hcp (hemolysin co-regulated protein) and VgrG (valine-glycine repeat), requires a functional T6SS. Gene clusters encoding T6SS machinery and putative substrates have been found in diverse animal and plant pathogens (8Pukatzki S. McAuley S.B. Miyata S.T. The type VI secretion system.

Many bacteria encode more than one T6SS; in the case of P. aeruginosa, three T6SS, H1-T6SS to H3-T6SS, have been described. There is emerging evidence that secreted T6SS effectors can target either eukaryotic host cells or other bacteria (9Schwarz S. Hood R.D. Mougous J.D.

V. cholerae VgrG1, which is homologous to a phage tail protein, is thought to function both as part of the secretion system and as a translocated effector (11Pukatzki S. Ma A.T. Revel A.T. Sturtevant D. Mekalanos J.J. Type VI secretion system translocates a phage tail spike-like protein into target cells where it cross-links actin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15508-15513Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). It encodes a C-terminal extension that can cross-link actin in vitro and in vivo and has been shown to be translocated into eukaryotic cells by a T6SS-dependent mechanism, where it is associated with cytotoxicity and virulence (12Ma A.T.

Similarly, the VgrG1 protein of Aeromonas hydrophila contains a VIP-2 (vegetative insecticidal protein domain 2) domain with an ADP-ribosyltransferase activity capable of modifying actin in vivo and is targeted to the host cytosol upon infection (14Suarez G.

Interestingly, gene loci encoding T6SSs are also found in nonpathogenic bacteria and symbionts, suggesting that T6SS may not be dedicated exclusively to pathogenic interactions of bacteria with eukaryotes (9Schwarz S.

Cotter P.A. Type VI secretion. Not just for pathogenesis anymore.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 2-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Indeed, T6SS can be potent mediators of interbacterial interactions as discovered in P. aeruginosa, where the type VI exported effectors Tse1–3 are bacteriolytic (15Hood R.D. Singh P. Hsu F. Güvener T. Carl M.A. Trinidad R.R. Silverman J.M. Ohlson B.B. Hicks K.G. Plemel R.L. Li M. Schwarz S. Wang W.Y. Merz A.J. Goodlett D.R. Mougous J.D.

Despite the increasing information available on the H1-T6SS, very little is known about the two other T6SSs encoded by P. aeruginosa. The H2-T6SS locus of the PA14 strain is required for virulence in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and in the mouse model of acute infections (19Lesic B. Starkey M. He J. Hazan R. Rahme L.G. Quorum sensing differentially regulates Pseudomonas aeruginosa type VI secretion locus I and homologous loci II and III, which are required for pathogenesis.Microbiology. 2009; 155: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although the H1-T6SS loci are very similar between the P. aeruginosa strains, PA14 and PAO1, their H2-T6SS loci differ; two putative structural components that are also exported, hcp2 and vgrG2, are present in PA14 but missing in PAO1. They constitute, together with two other genes, a divergent operon to the H2-T6SS secretion machinery operon. Indeed the H2-T6SS of strain PAO1 may lack the extracytoplasmic part of the T6SS contractile phage tail-like structure that is thought to punctuate the outer membrane and host cell membrane (5Basler M. Pilhofer M. Henderson G.P. Jensen G.J. Mekalanos J.J. Type VI secretion requires a dynamic contractile phage tail-like structure.Nature. 2012; 483: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). One could even ask whether the PAO1 H2-T6SS machinery can be functional. Here, we examined the regulation and function of H2-T6SS in PAO1. We find that it is subject to regulation by quorum sensing (QS) and by iron. In addition, we provide evidence that the H2 secretion machinery promotes bacterial internalization into epithelial cells, suggesting that this T6SS targets eukaryotic cells. Finally, we show that H2-T6SS plays a role in P. aeruginosa virulence in the worm model. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. LB and TSB broths and agar were used for the growth of P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli strains at 37 °C. The cultures were inoculated at A600 of 0.1 with overnight cultures, and strains were grown at 37 °C with aeration in LB or TSB. Recombinant plasmids were introduced in P. aeruginosa using the conjugative properties of pRK2013 (see Table 1). P. aeruginosa transconjugants were selected on Pseudomonas isolation agar (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. The antibiotics concentrations were as follows: for E. coli, ampicillin (50 μg ml−1), kanamycin (25 μg ml−1), tetracycline (15 μg ml−1), and chloramphenicol (50 μg ml−1); and for P. aeruginosa, carbenicillin (500 μg ml−1) and tetracycline (200 μg ml−1 for plates or 50 μg ml−1 for liquid growth).TABLE 1Strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in this studyStrain, plasmid, or oligonucleotideGenotype, description, or sequenceSource and/or referenceE. coli strains TG1supE, hsdΔR, thiΔ (lac-proAB), F′ (traD36, proAB+, lacIq, lacZΔM15))Laboratory collection CC118(λpir)(λpir) Δ (ara-leu), araD, ΔlacX74, galE, galK, phoA-20, thi-1, rpsE, rpoB, Arg(Am), recA1, Rfr (λpir)Ref. 70Herrero M. de Lorenzo V.

The pel genes of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAK strain are involved at early and late stages of biofilm formation.Microbiology. 2005; 151: 985-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned in pCR2.1 (TA cloning kit; Invitrogen) giving pTS24, which was then sequenced (GATC) and subcloned in pKNG101 suicide vector giving the mutator pTS27. pTS27, maintained in the E. coli CC118λpir strain, was mobilized in the wild type P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. The mutants, in which the double recombination events occurred that resulted in the nonpolar deletion of clpV2 gene, were verified by PCR using external primers OA14–OA17. The H2-T6SS-lacZ transcriptional fusions were constructed by PCR amplification of the 722-bp upstream DNA region from the tssA2 gene by using TSO1 and TSO3 primers (see Table 1). PCR amplification products were directly cloned into the pMini-CTX::lacZ vector (21Hoang T.T. Kutchma A.J. Becher A. Schweizer H.P. Integration-proficient plasmids for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Site-specific integration and use for engineering of reporter and expression strains.Plasmid. 2000; 43: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), yielding pTS2, or into pCR2.1 and pMP220, yielding pTS28 and pTS29, respectively. Nucleotide sequence was verified (GATC). The promoter fragment was integrated at the CTX phage attachment site in PAO1 and isogenic mutants using established protocols (21Hoang T.T. Kutchma A.J. Becher A. Schweizer H.P. Integration-proficient plasmids for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Site-specific integration and use for engineering of reporter and expression strains.Plasmid. 2000; 43: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The pTS29 was transferred into E. coli by conjugation. For β-galactosidase assay, overnight bacterial culture was diluted in TSB to an A600 of 0.1. Growth and β-galactosidase activity were monitored by harvesting samples at different time intervals. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to the Miller method, based on o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), and expressed in Miller units. PAO1 was grown in TSB at 37 °C for 5 h, and total RNA was extracted using the PureYield RNA Midiprep system (Promega). The MICROBExpress kit was used to purify mRNA (Ambion). 5′ RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen), starting at the TAP step on 1 μg of mRNA. Reverse transcription with Superscript III RT was performed with random oligonucleotides. TSO37, TSO38, GeneRacer 5′ Nested Primer, and GeneRacer 5′ Primer (see Table 1) were used for PCR amplification (high fidelity expand system; Roche Applied Science) of the first strand cDNA. The PCR product was cloned into the PCR2.1 vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and transformed in TOP10F′ competent cells. Cloning was screened using the M13 forward primer and M13 reverse primer, and the cloned products were sequenced using the M13 forward primer (GATC). For invasion assay, HeLa cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured to 70% confluence at the day of the experiment in 24-well plates in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and infected with P. aeruginosa wild type strain and the clpV2 mutant, grown as indicated in the text (log, transition, or stationary phase) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 in MEM with FBS at final volume of 1 ml. The plates were spun down at 1000 × g for 5 min to allow bacteria close contact with HeLa cells. After 3 h of infection at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and incubated with MEM supplemented with 300 μg ml−1of gentamicin (Sigma) for 2 h to kill extracellular bacteria. Afterward, the cells were washed three times with room temperature PBS and osmotically shocked with ice-cold sterile water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Lysed cells were collected in Eppendorf tubes, and serial dilutions in sterile LB were plated onto Pseudomonas isolation agar plates. Colony-forming units were enumerated and reported as internalized bacteria. For survival assay, HeLa cells were infected for 1.5 h and treated for 1 or 4 h with gentamicin 300 μg ml−1 to allow 3 h more for intracellular replication. For adhesion assays, infected cells were not incubated with gentamicin. Calu-3 cells, obtained from the ATCC, were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and l-glutamate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For experiments, the cells were grown on 12-mm Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size; Corning) for 2 days (1 × 106 cells/well). Calu-3 cells grown on Transwell filters were washed in serum-free MEM and preincubated with LY (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free MEM supplemented with l-glutamine for 1 h. Transition phase grown bacteria were added to the apical chamber of the Transwell filter for 3 h at an multiplicity of infection of 10. After incubation, the cells were washed with serum-free MEM and incubated with serum-free MEM containing 250 μg ml−1 gentamicin (Fisher) for 2.5 h. The cells were washed twice in PBS to remove antibiotic and lysed in 1 ml Ca2+ Mg2+-free PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. The cells were scraped off the Transwell filters, and the cell lysates were transferred to new tubes. Internalized bacteria were enumerated by plating serial dilutions of cell lysates to LB plates and counting colony-forming units. All of the assays were carried out on triplicate wells, and the results are reported as the average of three experiments ± S.D. (standard deviation). Calu-3 grown on Transwell filters were washed and placed in serum-free MEM supplemented with l-glutamate for 12 h. Transition phase grown bacteria were added for 1 h at an multiplicity of infection of 100. The infected monolayers were washed with cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm okadaic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), and proteinase inhibitor tablets (Complete; Roche Applied Science)) for 30 min. The cells were scraped off the Transwell filters, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. To preclear the cell lysate, the supernatant was mixed with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (4 Fast Flow; Amersham Biosciences), and the protein content was determined using protein assay reagent (bicinchoninic acid; Pierce). The cleared lysate (300–400 μg of protein) was incubated with polyclonal Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C and incubated for 2 h with protein G-Sepharose. The immune complexes were washed three times with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer without deoxycholate, eluted in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes Akt phosphorylated on serine 473 (Cell Signaling Technology). The membranes were washed with PBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all forms of Akt (Cell Signaling Technology). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 and secondary antibodies were diluted 1:3000. The slow killing assay was performed as described previously with modifications based on Ref. 23Zaborin A.

Each independent assay consisted of three replicates. E. coli OP50 was used as a control. L4 to adult stage C. elegans were removed from food and placed on unseeded NGM plates for 24 h at 25 °C. 50 worms were then picked onto plates containing overnight growth of each bacterial strain. The worms were evaluated for viability on a daily basis. The assay was performed three times. Animal survival was plotted using the PRISM 5.0 program. Survival curves were considered significantly different from the control when p values were <0.05. PRISM calculated survival fractions using the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method and compared survival curves by two methods: the log-rank test (also called the Mantel-Cox test) and the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test.

https://openalex.org/W1969121713,"The mechanism by which renal cell carcinoma (RCC) colonizes the lung microenvironment during metastasis remains largely unknown. To investigate this process, we grafted human RCC cells with varying lung metastatic potential in mice. Gene expression profiling of the mouse lung stromal compartment revealed a signature enriched for neutrophil-specific functions that was induced preferentially by poorly metastatic cells. Analysis of the gene expression signatures of tumor cell lines showed an inverse correlation between metastatic activity and the levels of a number of chemokines, including CXCL5 and IL8. Enforced depletion of CXCL5 and IL8 in these cell lines enabled us to establish a functional link between lung neutrophil infiltration, secretion of chemokines by cancer cells and metastatic activity. We further show that human neutrophils display a higher cytotoxic activity against poorly metastatic cells compared with highly metastatic cells. Together, these results support a model in which neutrophils recruited to the lung by tumor-secreted chemokines build an antimetastatic barrier with loss of neutrophil chemokines in tumor cells acting as a critical rate-limiting step during lung metastatic seeding."
https://openalex.org/W2139544397,"The canonical Wnt signalling pathway induces the β-catenin/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors. It is activated in various cancers, most characteristically carcinomas, in which it promotes metastatic spread by increasing migration and/or invasion. The Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway is frequently activated in melanoma, but the presence of β-catenin in the nucleus does not seem to be a sign of aggressiveness in these tumours. We found that, unlike its positive role in stimulating migration and invasion of carcinoma cells, β-catenin signalling decreased the migration of melanocytes and melanoma cell lines. In vivo, β-catenin signalling in melanoblasts reduced the migration of these cells, causing a white belly-spot phenotype. The inhibition by β-catenin of migration was dependent on MITF-M, a key transcription factor of the melanocyte lineage, and CSK, an Src-inhibitor. Despite reducing migration, β-catenin signalling promoted lung metastasis in the NRAS-driven melanoma murine model. Thus, β-catenin may have conflicting roles in the metastatic spread of melanoma, repressing migration while promoting metastasis. These results highlight that metastasis formation requires a series of successful cellular processes, any one of which may not be optimally efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2130724559,"Translocations and amplifications of the mixed lineage leukemia-1 (MLL1) gene are associated with aggressive myeloid and lymphocytic leukemias in humans. MLL1 is a member of the SET1 family of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases, which are required for transcription of genes involved in hematopoiesis and development. MLL1 associates with a subcomplex containing WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 (WRAD), which together form the MLL1 core complex that is required for sequential mono- and dimethylation of H3K4. We previously demonstrated that WDR5 binds the conserved WDR5 interaction (Win) motif of MLL1 in vitro, an interaction that is required for the H3K4 dimethylation activity of the MLL1 core complex. In this investigation, we demonstrate that arginine 3765 of the MLL1 Win motif is required to co-immunoprecipitate WRAD from mammalian cells, suggesting that the WDR5-Win motif interaction is important for the assembly of the MLL1 core complex in vivo. We also demonstrate that peptides that mimic SET1 family Win motif sequences inhibit H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex with varying degrees of efficiency. To understand the structural basis for these differences, we determined structures of WDR5 bound to six different naturally occurring Win motif sequences at resolutions ranging from 1.9 to 1.2 Å. Our results reveal that binding energy differences result from interactions between non-conserved residues C-terminal to the Win motif and to a lesser extent from subtle variation of residues within the Win motif. These results highlight a new class of methylation inhibitors that may be useful for the treatment of MLL1-related malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2090507503,"Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, which facilitates cell proliferation. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and oncoprotein Myc are two prominent transcription factors that drive glycolysis. Previously, we reported that the estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) act as cofactors of HIF and enhance HIF-dependent transcription of glycolytic genes under hypoxia. ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors and key regulators of energy metabolism by orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we show that ERRs also stimulate glycolysis under normoxia. ERRs directly bind to and activate promoters of many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, and the ERR-binding sites in such promoters are essential for ERR-mediated transcriptional activation. ERRs interact with Myc, and the two factors synergistically activate transcription of glycolytic genes. Furthermore, overexpression of ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression and lactate production. Conversely, depletion of ERRs in cancer cells reduces expression of glycolytic genes and glucose uptake, resulting in decreased aerobic glycolysis and cell growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ERRs are important transcriptional activators of the glycolytic pathway and contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973330653,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is commonly described as a transcription factor, which regulates xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Recent studies have suggested that the binding of ligands to the AhR also activates the Src kinase. In this manuscript, we show that the AhR, through the activation of Src, activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and promotes integrin clustering. These effects contribute to cell migration. Further, we show that the activation of the AhR increases the interaction of FAK with the metastatic marker, HEF1/NEDD9/CAS-L, and the expression of several integrins. Xenobiotic exposure, thus, may contribute to novel cell-migratory programs."
https://openalex.org/W1992219661,"Autophagy is triggered by the intracellular bacterial sensor NOD2 (nucleotide-binding, oligomerization domain 2) as an anti-bacterial response. Defects in autophagy have been implicated in Crohn's disease susceptibility. The molecular mechanisms of activation and regulation of this process by NOD2 are not well understood, with recent studies reporting conflicting requirements for RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 2) in autophagy induction. We examined the requirement of NOD2 signaling mediated by RIP2 for anti-bacterial autophagy induction and clearance of Salmonella typhimurium in the intestinal epithelial cell line HCT116. Our data demonstrate that NOD2 stimulates autophagy in a process dependent on RIP2 tyrosine kinase activity. Autophagy induction requires the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinases MEKK4 and p38 but is independent of NFκB signaling. Activation of autophagy was inhibited by a PP2A phosphatase complex, which interacts with both NOD2 and RIP2. PP2A phosphatase activity inhibited NOD2-dependent autophagy but not activation of NFκB or p38. Upon stimulation of NOD2, the phosphatase activity of the PP2A complex is inhibited through tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit in a process dependent on RIP2 activity. These findings demonstrate that RIP2 tyrosine kinase activity is not only required for NOD2-dependent autophagy but plays a dual role in this process. RIP2 both sends a positive autophagy signal through activation of p38 MAPK and relieves repression of autophagy mediated by the phosphatase PP2A."
https://openalex.org/W2064694446,"Plant height, heading date, and yield are the main targets for rice genetic improvement. Ghd7 is a pleiotropic gene that controls the aforementioned traits simultaneously. In this study, a rice germplasm collection of 104 accessions (Oryza sativa) and 3 wild rice varieties (O.rufipogon) was used to analyze the evolution and association of Ghd7 with plant height, heading date, and yield. Among the 104 accessions, 76 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and six insertions and deletions were found within a 3932-bp DNA fragment of Ghd7. A higher pairwise π and θ in the promoter indicated a highly diversified promoter of Ghd7. Sixteen haplotypes and 8 types of Ghd7 protein were detected. SNP changes between haplotypes indicated that Ghd7 evolved from two distinct ancestral gene pools, and independent domestication processes were detected in indica and japonica varietals respectively. In addition to the previously reported premature stop mutation in the first exon of Ghd7, which caused phenotypic changes of multiple traits, we found another functional C/T mutation (SNP S_555) by structure-based association analysis. SNP S_555 is located in the promoter and was related to plant height probably by altering gene expression. Moreover, another seven SNP mutations in complete linkage were found to be associated with the number of spikelets per panicle, regardless of the photoperiod. These associations provide the potential for flexibility of Ghd7 application in rice breeding programs."

FACS-sorted tTReg cells differentiated into FoxP+IL-17+ and FoxP3-IL-17+ CD4+ cells upon TCR-mediated stimulation. Blocking experiments with anti-ICOS-L MoAb resulted in a significant inhibition of tTReg cell generation whereas both IL-10 & TGFβ blockade did not. MM tumour cells can directly generate functional TReg cells in a contact-dependent manner, mediated by ICOS/ICOS-L. These features suggest that tumour generation of TReg cells may contribute to evasion of immune surveillance by the host."

Sheddases that cleave extracellular domains are often members of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, which are Zn2+-dependent proteases. After cleavage of the extracellular domain by a sheddase, some cell surface receptors are further cleaved by intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CliPs) within the transmembrane domain in a process termed regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In some proteins such as Notch (29.Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Notch-1 signalling requires ligand-induced proteolytic release of intracellular domain.Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ErbB4) (30.Sardi S.P. Murtie J. Koirala S. Patten B.A. Corfas G.

In other proteins, the cytosolic fragments play various roles related to the function of the complete protein. The cytosolic domain of Ephrin-B2 activates Src by competing with Csk which phosphorylates and inhibits Src (31.Georgakopoulos A. Litterst C. Ghersi E. Baki L. Xu C. Serban G. Robakis N.K. Metalloproteinase/Presenilin1 processing of ephrinB regulates EphB-induced Src phosphorylation and signaling.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1242-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cleavage of E-cadherin by an I-Clip down-regulates cell adhesion and enhances Wnt signaling through the release of β-catenin (32.Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. A presenilin-1/γ-secretase cleavage releases the E-cadherin intracellular domain and regulates disassembly of adherens junctions.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the role of PTK7, we generated recombinant soluble PTK7 (sPTK7), which contains the entire extracellular domain consisting of Ig1–7 and acts as a decoy receptor to counteract PTK7 function. We previously demonstrated that treatment with sPTK7 induces an effect similar to PTK7 knockdown and inhibits VEGF-induced tube formation, migration, invasion of HUVECs, and VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo (33.Shin W.S. Maeng Y.S. Jung J.W. Min J.K. Kwon Y.G. Lee S.T. Soluble PTK7 inhibits tube formation, migration, and invasion of endothelial cells and angiogenesis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ADAMs or MMPs that act as sheddases are often up-regulated during carcinogenesis. Thus, we hypothesized that sPTK7 may be generated in cancers by shedding of PTK7. In addition, MMP-14-dependent shedding of PTK7 was observed in breast cancer cells, and MMP-14 overexpression in fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells induced the release of an extracellular domain of PTK7 containing the first six Ig loops (sPTK7-Ig1–6) (34.Golubkov V.S. Chekanov A.V. Cieplak P. Aleshin A.E. Chernov A.V. Zhu W. Radichev I.A. Zhang D. Dong P.D. Strongin A.Y.

However, we found that, in colon cancer cells, PTK7 is shed into a form containing seven Ig loops, sPTK7-Ig1–7. Here, we report that in colon cancer cells PTK7 is sequentially processed in an extracellular cleavage event followed by intramembrane cleavage. We further demonstrate that the resulting cytosolic fragment of PTK7 has oncogenic properties. Mouse anti-human PTK7 monoclonal antibody against human sPTK7-His was generated and purified by Ab Frontier (Seoul, Korea).

To construct pcDNA3.1-PTK7-Cyt-FLAG, which expresses human PTK7 cytosolic domain containing residues 726–1070 of PTK7 and a C-terminal FLAG tag, the cDNA was PCR-amplified using pcDNA3-hPTK7-FLAG as a template and 5′-GTCGCTAGCATGTGCAAGAAGCGCTGCAAAGC-3′, including an NheI site (italicized), a start codon (bold), and nucleotide positions of 2323–2342 of PTK7 cDNA (GenBank accession number U40271), and 5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′, nucleotide positions 1036–1053 of pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), as primer pairs. The amplified fragments were digested with NheI and EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3.1. To generate pcDNA3.1-PTK7-CTF2-FLAG encoding residues 722–1070 of PTK7 and the C-terminal FLAG tag, nucleotides encoding residues 722–725 of PTK7 were inserted into pcDNA3.1-PTK7-Cyt-FLAG by DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and 5′-GCAGTAGAACATGAGCATGGTGGCGCTAGCCAGCTTGGGTCTCCCTATAGTGA-3′ and 5′-GCGCCACCATGCTCATGTTCTACTGCAAGAAGCGCTGCAAAGCCA-3′, including a Kozak's consensus sequence (underlined), a start codon (bold), and nucleotide positions 2311–2325 of PTK7 cDNA (GenBank accession number U40271), as primers. The colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-8, HCT-15, HCT-116, SW480, DLD-1, LoVo, and HT-29) and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection with plasmid DNA, subconfluent cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (37.Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Transformation of mammalian cells with genes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 1979.BioTechnology. 1992; 24: 444-452PubMed Google Scholar) followed by selection with 1.2 mg/ml G418. After 2 weeks, all colonies were cultured as a mixed population or individual clones. For transfection with siRNA (100 nm), subconfluent cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subconfluent cells were incubated in serum-free medium either for 8 h without PMA or for 30 min with 100 ng/ml PMA. To collect proteins secreted into the medium, the medium was spun down at 2,000 rpm for 5 min and then precipitated with cold TCA (Sigma). The cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2-agarose and then washed in PBS three times. For Western blot analysis, cell lysates, TCA-precipitated medium, or immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. SW480 cells expressing PTK7-FLAG were preincubated in serum-free medium with 10 μm GM6001 or dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 min and then treated with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min. The cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. The precipitated C-terminal fragments of PTK7 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. N-terminal sequences of the C-terminal fragments were analyzed by the Edman degradation method at the Tufts Core Facility (Tufts University, Medford, MA). SW480 cells expressing FLAG-PTK7 were pretreated with 10 μm DAPT for 30 min and then treated with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min. The cells were collected by scraping in PBS, spun down at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Nonidet P-40 was then added to a final concentration of 0.625%, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min to separate the cytosolic fraction from the nuclear pellet. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in hypotonic buffer, resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer, and incubated for 20 min. The nuclear fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. SW480 cells expressing PTK7-CTF2-FLAG or transfected with a control vector were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1 μg/ml; Sigma), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1 μg/ml; Invitrogen), and DAPI (0.25 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence was visualized with a confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cell proliferation was assessed by an MTT assay. Subconfluent cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 103 cells in 96-well plates and incubated in DMEM containing 5% FBS. After incubation for the indicated time intervals, cells were stained with 0.5 mg/ml MTT in DMEM for 4 h and then disrupted using dimethyl sulfoxide. Absorbance of the extract at 565 nm was measured. Cell migration was assayed using modified Boyden chambers (8-μm pore size, Costar Transwell filters; Corning-Costar, Lowell, MA) coated with 0.1% gelatin. Subconfluent cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. The 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl of serum-free medium were loaded on the upper chamber. DMEM (600 μl) containing 5% FBS served as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells in the upper surface of the upper chamber were removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the upper chamber were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and counted under a light microscope. Anchorage-independent colony formation was measured as described previously (38.Kim H.Ie. Lee S.T. An intramolecular interaction between SH2-kinase linker and kinase domain is essential for the catalytic activity of protein-tyrosine kinase-6.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28973-28980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 104/well) were suspended in DMEM-10% FBS containing 0.35% Bacto agar (Difco, Sparks, MD) incubated at 42 °C and overlaid onto the solidified 0.5% agar layer containing DMEM-10% FBS. After 3 weeks of incubation, the number of colonies formed was counted with a microscope. To examine whether shedding of PTK7 occurs in colon cancer cell lines, Western blot analysis with an antibody against the extracellular domain of PTK7 in various colon cancer cell lines (HCT-8, HCT-15, HCT-116, DLD-1, LoVo, HT-29, and SW480) and HEK293 cells was performed. We detected a 100-kDa band in the conditioned medium from colon cancer cells and HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). A band of similar molecular mass was observed in HEK293 cells ectopically expressing the sPTK7-His polypeptide. Considering that sPTK7-His contains all seven Ig loops in the extracellular domain of PTK7 and a His tag (33.Shin W.S. Maeng Y.S. Jung J.W. Min J.K. Kwon Y.G. Lee S.T. Soluble PTK7 inhibits tube formation, migration, and invasion of endothelial cells and angiogenesis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 371: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), this result indicates that the shed fragment of PTK7 in colon cancer cells should also contain all seven Ig loops in the extracellular domain. Thus, it was named sPTK7-Ig1–7. Phorbol esters such as PMA are potent activators of PKC and have been reported to stimulate shedding of diverse proteins such as IL-6R, ErbB4, and TNF-α (39.Huovila A.P. Turner A.J. Pelto-Huikko M. Kärkkäinen I. Ortiz R.M. Shedding light on ADAM metalloproteinases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed whether PMA increases shedding of sPTK7-Ig1–7 in SW480 cells. PMA treatment enhanced release of sPTK7-Ig1–7 into conditioned medium when compared with mock- or dimethyl sulfoxide-treated cells (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass of sPTK7-Ig1–7 did not change in the presence of PMA (Fig. 1B). To address which protease mediates PTK7 shedding, we analyzed PTK7 shedding in the presence of various protease inhibitors in SW480 cells. A panmetalloprotease inhibitor (GM6001) and an MMP and ADAM17 inhibitor (TAPI-1) blocked constitutive shedding of PTK7, but inhibitors of serine proteases (AEBSF), cysteine and serine proteases (leupeptin), aspartic proteases (pepstatin), and cysteine proteases (E-64) did not (Fig. 2A). Like constitutive PTK7 shedding, PMA-induced PTK7 shedding was also inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitors, GM6001 and TAPI-1, but not by other protease inhibitors (Fig. 2B). Thus, the shed fragment size and metalloprotease requirement were the same in constitutive or PMA-induced sPTK7-Ig1–7 shedding. To identify the cleavage site of PTK7 shedding, PTK7-FLAG was stably expressed in SW480 cells. SW480 cells expressing PTK7-FLAG were stimulated with PMA in the presence or absence of GM6001, and PTK7 shedding was analyzed. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by Western blot analysis revealed the presence of two CTFs of PTK7, which we named PTK7-CTF1-FLAG and PTK7-CTF2-FLAG (Fig. 3A). To identify the cleavage sites, the CTF bands that were detected in Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS gels (Fig. 3A) were subjected to N-terminal sequencing by the Edman degradation method. The N-terminal sequences of PTK7-CTF1-FLAG and PTK7-CTF2-FLAG were 690SEGPG and 722LMFYX, respectively (Fig. 3B). The amino acid residue at the X position was Cys which could not be detected by this method. This finding suggests that PTK7 is cleaved at two different positions; between amino acids Glu689 and Ser690 near the C terminus of the extracellular domain (Ala31 to Gln703) and between amino acids Gly721 and Leu722 near the C terminus of a transmembrane segment (Thr704 to Tyr725). Therefore, sPTK7-Ig1–7 that spans Ala31 to Glu689 (Fig. 3B) is shed into the extracellular space, and PTK7-CTF2-FLAG which spans Leu722 to Pro1070 is likely released into the cytosol. To characterize which metalloprotease is involved, sPTK7-Ig1–7 shedding was analyzed in the presence of TIMPs, which are major physiological metalloprotease inhibitors. SW480 cells, in which one of four TIMPs was stably expressed, were stimulated with PMA to enhance sPTK7-Ig1–7 shedding. Shedding of sPTK7-Ig1–7 was efficiently suppressed by TIMP-3, but not by TIMP-1, TIMP-2, or TIMP-4 (Fig. 4A). TIMP-3 inhibits various MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-13, MMP-14, and MMP-15) (40.Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Osenkowski P. Sohail A. Pei D. Nagase H. Kashiwagi M. Soloway P.D. DeClerck Y.A. Fridman R. Differential inhibition of membrane type 3 (MT3)-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and MT1-MMP by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 and TIMP-3 rgulates pro-MMP-2 activation.J.

However, the MMPs inhibited by TIMP-3 are also inhibited by at least one other TIMP that cannot block PTK7 shedding, suggesting that the sheddase is ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 and not an MMP. However, TIMP-1 inhibits ADAM10 but not ADAM17 and does not prevent PTK7 shedding (41.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knäuper V.

https://openalex.org/W2012795254,"Vitamin E is a family of naturally occurring and structurally related lipophilic antioxidants, one of which, α-tocopherol (α-TOH), selectively accumulates in vertebrate tissues. The ω-hydroxylase cytochrome P450-4F2 (CYP4F2) is the only human enzyme shown to metabolize vitamin E. Using cDNA cloning, cell culture expression, and activity assays, we identified Cyp4f14 as a functional murine ortholog of CYP4F2. We then investigated the effect of Cyp4f14 deletion on vitamin E metabolism and status in vivo. Cyp4f14-null mice exhibited substrate-specific reductions in liver microsomal vitamin E-ω-hydroxylase activity ranging from 93% (γ-TOH) to 48% (γ-tocotrienol). In vivo data obtained from metabolic cage studies showed whole-body reductions in metabolism of γ-TOH of 90% and of 68% for δ- and α-TOH. This metabolic deficit in Cyp4f14(-/-) mice was partially offset by increased fecal excretion of nonmetabolized tocopherols and of novel ω-1- and ω-2-hydroxytocopherols. 12'-OH-γ-TOH represented 41% of whole-body production of γ-TOH metabolites in Cyp4f14(-/-) mice fed a soybean oil diet. Despite these counterbalancing mechanisms, Cyp4f14-null mice fed this diet for 6 weeks hyper-accumulated γ-TOH (2-fold increase over wild-type littermates) in all tissues and appeared normal. We conclude that CYP4F14 is the major but not the only vitamin E-ω-hydroxylase in mice. Its disruption significantly impairs whole-body vitamin E metabolism and alters the widely conserved phenotype of preferential tissue deposition of α-TOH. This model animal and its derivatives will be valuable in determining the biological actions of specific tocopherols and tocotrienols in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2035219279,"Cytokinesis is initiated by constriction of the cleavage furrow and terminated by abscission of the intercellular bridge that connects two separating daughter cells. The complicated processes of cytokinesis are coordinated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by protein kinases and phosphatases. Mammalian Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) is a member of the germinal center kinases and is known to regulate cytoskeletal organization and oncogene-induced cell senescence. To search for novel regulators of cytokinesis, we performed a screen using a library of siRNAs and found that MINK1 was essential for cytokinesis. Time-lapse analysis revealed that MINK1-depleted cells were able to initiate furrowing but that abscission was disrupted. STRN4 (Zinedin) is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and was recently shown to be a component of a novel protein complex called striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK). Mass spectrometry analysis showed that MINK1 was a component of STRIPAK and that MINK1 directly interacted with STRN4. Similar to MINK1 depletion, STRN4-knockdown induced multinucleated cells and inhibited the completion of abscission. In addition, STRN4 reduced MINK1 activity in the presence of catalytic and structural subunits of PP2A. Our study identifies a novel regulatory network of protein kinases and phosphatases that regulate the completion of abscission."
https://openalex.org/W2037241677,"The Italian Space Agency, in line with its scientific strategies and the National Utilization Plan for the International Space Station (ISS), contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to design and build a spaceflight payload for rodent research on ISS: the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28th, 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27th, 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova. Control tissues were collected also from mice maintained on Earth in standard vivarium cages."
https://openalex.org/W2103869732,"TpeL is a member of the family of clostridial glucosylating toxins produced by Clostridium perfringens type A, B, and C strains. In contrast to other members of this toxin family, it lacks a C-terminal polypeptide repeat domain, which is suggested to be involved in target cell binding. It was shown that the glucosyltransferase domain of TpeL modifies Ras in vitro by mono-O-glucosylation or mono-O-GlcNAcylation (Nagahama, M., Ohkubo, A., Oda, M., Kobayashi, K., Amimoto, K., Miyamoto, K., and Sakurai, J. (2011) Infect. Immun. 79, 905-910). Here we show that TpeL preferably utilizes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a sugar donor. Change of alanine 383 of TpeL to isoleucine turns the sugar donor preference from UDP-GlcNAc to UDP-glucose. In contrast to previous studies, we show that Rac is a poor substrate in vitro and in vivo and requires 1-2 magnitudes higher toxin concentrations for modification by TpeL. The toxin is autoproteolytically processed in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)) by an intrinsic cysteine protease domain, located next to the glucosyltransferase domain. A C-terminally extended TpeL full-length variant (TpeL1-1779) induces apoptosis in HeLa cells (most likely by mono-O-GlcNAcylation of Ras), and inhibits Ras signaling including Ras-Raf interaction and ERK activation. In addition, TpeL blocks Ras signaling in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. TpeL is a glucosylating toxin, which modifies Ras and induces apoptosis in target cells without having a typical C-terminal polypeptide repeat domain."
https://openalex.org/W2153809861,"The circadian clock of cyanobacteria is composed of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC proteins, and the SasA-RpaA two-component system has been implicated in the regulation of one of the output pathways of the clock. In this study, we show that another response regulator that is essential for viability, the RpaA paralog, RpaB, plays a central role in the transcriptional oscillation of clock-regulated genes. In vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that RpaB and not RpaA could specifically bind to the kaiBC promoter, possibly repressing transcription during subjective night. This suggested that binding may be terminated by RpaA to activate gene transcription during subjective day. Moreover, we found that rpoD6 and sigF2, which encode group-2 and group-3 σ factors for RNA polymerase, respectively, were also targets of the RpaAB system, suggesting that a specific group of σ factors can propagate genome-wide transcriptional oscillation. Our findings thus reveal a novel mechanism for a circadian output pathway that is mediated by two paralogous response regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1983421902,"LASP-1 is a multidomain protein predominantly localized at focal contacts, where it regulates cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration. However, in different tumor entities, a nuclear LASP-1 accumulation is observed, thought to have an important role in cancer progression. Until now, the molecular mechanisms that control LASP-1 nuclear import were not elucidated. Here, we identified a novel LASP-1-binding partner, zona occludens protein 2 (ZO-2), and established its role in the signal transduction pathway of LASP-1 nucleo-cytoplasmatic shuttling. Phosphorylation of LASP-1 by PKA at serine 146 induces translocation of the LASP-1/ZO-2 complex from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Interaction occurs within the carboxyterminal proline-rich motif of ZO-2 and the SH3 domain in LASP-1. In situ proximity ligation assay confirmed the direct binding between LASP-1 and ZO-2 and visualized the shuttling. Nuclear export is mediated by Crm-1 and a newly identified nuclear export signal in LASP-1. Finally, dephosphorylation of LASP-1 by phosphatase PP2B is suggested to relocalize the protein back to focal contacts. In summary, we define a new pathway for LASP-1 in tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2061774515,"A role for WNT signalling in gastric carcinogenesis has been suggested due to two major observations. First, patients with germline mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are susceptible to stomach polyps and second, in gastric cancer, WNT activation confers a poor prognosis. However, the functional significance of deregulated WNT signalling in gastric homoeostasis and cancer is still unclear. In this study we have addressed this by investigating the immediate effects of WNT signalling activation within the stomach epithelium. We have specifically activated the WNT signalling pathway within the mouse adult gastric epithelium via deletion of either glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) or APC or via expression of a constitutively active β-catenin protein. WNT pathway deregulation dramatically affects stomach homoeostasis at very short latencies. In the corpus, there is rapid loss of parietal cells with fundic gland polyp (FGP) formation and adenomatous change, which are similar to those observed in familial adenomatous polyposis. In the antrum, adenomas occur from 4 days post-WNT activation. Taken together, these data show a pivotal role for WNT signalling in gastric homoeostasis, FGP formation and adenomagenesis. Loss of the parietal cell population and corresponding FGP formation, an early event in gastric carcinogenesis, as well as antral adenoma formation are immediate effects of nuclear β-catenin translocation and WNT target gene expression. Furthermore, our inducible murine model will permit a better understanding of the molecular changes required to drive tumourigenesis in the stomach."

https://openalex.org/W2077761422,"Genome-wide studies have strongly associated a non-synonymous polymorphism (rs16969968) that changes the 398th amino acid in the nAChR α5 subunit from aspartic acid to asparagine (D398N), with greater risk for increased nicotine consumption. We have used a pentameric concatemer approach to express defined and consistent populations of α3β4α5 nAChR in Xenopus oocytes. α5(Asn-398; risk) variant incorporation reduces ACh-evoked function compared with inclusion of the common α5(Asp-398) variant without altering agonist or antagonist potencies. Unlinked α3, β4, and α5 subunits assemble to form a uniform nAChR population with pharmacological properties matching those of concatemeric α3β4* nAChRs. α5 subunit incorporation reduces α3β4* nAChR function after coinjection with unlinked α3 and β4 subunits but increases that of α3β4α5 versus α3β4-only concatemers. α5 subunit incorporation into α3β4* nAChR also alters the relative efficacies of competitive agonists and changes the potency of the non-competitive antagonist mecamylamine. Additional observations indicated that in the absence of α5 subunits, free α3 and β4 subunits form at least two further subtypes. The pharmacological profiles of these free subunit α3β4-only subtypes are dissimilar both to each other and to those of α3β4α5 nAChR. The α5 variant-induced change in α3β4α5 nAChR function may underlie some of the phenotypic changes associated with this polymorphism."
https://openalex.org/W2042749830,"The transcription factor c-Myc has a critical role in cell proliferation and growth. The control of ribosome biogenesis by c-Myc through the regulation of transcription mediated by all three RNA polymerases is essential for c-Myc-driven proliferation. Specifically, in the nucleolus, c-Myc has been shown to be recruited to ribosomal DNA and activate RNA polymerase (pol) I-mediated transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. In addition, c-Myc accumulates in nucleoli upon inhibition of the proteasome, suggesting nucleolar localization also has a role in c-Myc proteolysis. Nucleophosmin (NPM), a predominantly nucleolar protein, is also critical in ribosome biogenesis and, like c-Myc, is found overexpressed in many types of tumors. Previously, we demonstrated that NPM directly interacts with c-Myc and controls c-Myc-induced hyperproliferation and transformation. Here, we show that NPM is necessary for the localization of c-Myc protein to nucleoli, whereas c-Myc nucleolar localization is independent of p53, Mdm2 and ARF. Conversely, high transient NPM expression enhances c-Myc nucleolar localization, leading to increased c-Myc proteolysis. In addition, NPM is necessary for the ability of c-Myc to induce rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus, and constitutive NPM overexpression stimulates c-Myc-mediated rRNA synthesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate an essential role for NPM in c-Myc nucleolar localization and c-Myc-mediated rDNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1971876059,"Mitochondria respiratory chain (RC), consisting of five multisubunit complexes, is crucial for cellular energy production, reactive oxygen species generation, and regulation of apoptosis. Recently, a few mitochondrial proteins have been reported to be essential for innate immunity, but the function of mitochondrial RC in innate immunity is largely unknown. By knock-out of GRIM-19, a newly identified subunit protein of mitochondrial complex I, in mice, we found that heterogeneous mice (GRIM-19+/−) are prone to spontaneous urinary tract infection, mostly by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Macrophages derived from these mice have compromised mitochondrial complex I activity and increased reactive oxygen species level. Bacterial infection induces a rapid up-regulation of GRIM-19 and complex I activity in the wild-type macrophages, but both are reduced in the macrophages from GRIM-19+/− mice. These cells also have decreased intracellular killing ability against S. saprophyticus. The defects for this probably occur in the fusion of bacteria to lysosome, but not in the bacterial engulfment and macrophage migration. In addition, production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-12, IL-6, and interferon (IFN)-γ, induced by both bacterial infection and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and monodansylcadaverine treatment, is also decreased in the GRIM19+/− macrophages. Inhibition of mitochondrial RC activity by inhibitors shows a similar reduction on the cytokine production. Due to low cytokine production, the inflammatory response caused by in vivo bacterial challenge in the bladders of GRIM-19+/− mice is compromised. This study provides genetic evidence for a critical role of mitochondrial RC in innate immunity.

This study provides genetic evidence for a critical role of mitochondrial RC in innate immunity. The mammalian innate immune system is critical for the early detection of the invading viral and bacterial pathogens and initiating cellular host defense responses. Detection of the microbes by host cells relies on several families of pattern recognition proteins. Four main families of pattern recognition proteins have been characterized: the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 6The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorRCmitochondria respiratory chainGRIM-19genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality-19MDCmonodansylcadaverinePIpropidium iodideBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageNODnucleotide oligomerization domainNLRNOD-like receptorsMDPmuramyl dipeptideH2DCFH-DA2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateUTIurinary tract infectionPAMPpathogen-associated molecular patternROSreactive oxygen speciesrDNArecombinant DNALC3light chain 3. cytosolic nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-1)-like receptors (RLRs) (1West A.P.

These pattern recognition proteins recognize the molecular markers of invaders, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA, signal to downstream pathways, including NF-κB, JNK, p38, and ERK, and initiate the production of nuclear-encoded pro-immune cytokines (2Scott I.

Mitochondria are organelles that control the “life and death” of a cell in most eukaryotes (3Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Mitochondria: releasing power for life and unleashing the machineries of death.Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). As a powerhouse of the cell, one of the most important functions of mitochondria is to generate cellular energy (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), localized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, consists of five multisubunit complexes (complexes I–V), which catalyze oxidative phosphorylation by transferring electrons from reducing substrates (NADH-FADH2) to molecular oxygen. The electron transport generates an electrochemical proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, which drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase (complex V) (4Hatefi Y. The mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schultz B.E. Chan S.I. Structures and proton-pumping strategies of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 23-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). During oxidative phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also generated, which function as a signaling molecule and influence many cellular functions (6Boveris A. Chance B. The mitochondrial generation of hydrogen peroxide: general properties and effect of hyperbaric oxygen.Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, 7Melov S. Coskun P.E. Wallace D.C. Mouse models of mitochondrial disease, oxidative stress, and senescence.Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, mitochondria also play important roles in the regulation of apoptosis and maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (8Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar, 9Cao X. Chen Y. Mitochondria and calcium signaling in embryonic development.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 20: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, as the major functional components of mitochondria, whether mitochondrial RC directly regulates innate immunity is largely unknown. GRIM-19 (genes associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality-19) was originally identified as an apoptosis-related gene in human cancer cell lines (10Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Identification of GRIM-19, a novel cell death-regulatory gene induced by the interferon-β and retinoic acid combination, using a genetic approach.J. Biol.

We and others have recently demonstrated that GRIM-19 is a nuclear-encoded subunit of mitochondrial complex I (11Fearnley I.M. Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Hirst J.

Cao X. GRIM-19 is essential for maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Strikingly, deletion of GRIM-19 alone totally destroys the assembly and enzymatic activity of complex I, although complex I contains 46 subunits in mammals (14Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M.

Knock-out of GRIM-19 in mice causes early embryonic lethality (12Huang G. Lu H. Hao A. Ng D.C. Ponniah S. Guo K. Lufei C. Zeng Q. Cao X.

In this study, we observed that mice with heterozygous GRIM-19 gene (GRIM-19+/−) are prone to bacterial infection in their urinary tracts. Macrophages derived from these mice with a reduced mitochondrial complex I activity and enhanced ROS level display a decreased bacterial killing ability and production of selective proinflammatory cytokines. These results provide genetic evidence for the role of mitochondrial RC in innate immunity. The mouse protocol was approved by the Biological Resource Centre Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Biopolis, Singapore. GRIM-19+/− mice (C57BL/SW strain) were generated as described previously (12Huang G. Lu H. Hao A. Ng D.C. Ponniah S. Guo K. Lufei C. Zeng Q. Cao X. GRIM-19, a cell death regulatory protein, is essential for assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8447-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). 2–5 WT and GRIM-19+/− mice from the same sex/age groups were mixed and bred in the same cage to eliminate the effect of environment on the phenotypes. Monodansylcadaverine (MDC), LPS, and muramyl dipeptide (MDP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Monoclonal antibodies against NDUFS3 and actin were purchased from Molecular Probes and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Antibody against mouse GRIM-19 was generated as described previously (12Huang G. Lu H. Hao A. Ng D.C. Ponniah S. Guo K. Lufei C. Zeng Q. Cao X. GRIM-19, a cell death regulatory protein, is essential for assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I.Mol. Cell.

Bone marrow from mouse tibia and femur was harvested by flushing with EMEM-10 supplemented with 0.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). After centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min, bone marrow cells were resuspended in macrophage differentiation medium, which consists of 70% EMEM-10 and 30% L929 cell conditioned medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Bone marrow cells (2 × 107) were cultured in 10 ml of macrophage differentiation medium at 37 °C for 7 days. 10 ml of fresh macrophage differentiation medium was added at day 4. The adherent macrophages were detached from culture dishes by treatment with 1 mg/ml dispase (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by scraping with a sterile cell scraper. The resuspended cells were then directly used for migration assay or seeded on cell culture plates for other experiments. BMDMs from WT and GRIM-19+/− mice were cultured in macrophage differentiation medium and seeded in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). Bacteria were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C until A600 of 4.2 (∼1 × 108 bacteria/ml). Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in cell challenge medium (DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS). After a brief wash of BMDMs with cell challenge medium, bacteria (multiplicity of infection = 50) were added onto the monolayer of BMDMs. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow phagocytosis. Cells were then washed with and cultured in cell challenge medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamycin before being harvested for experiments. For measuring intracellular bacterial survival rate, macrophages were lysed in 1% Triton at the indicated time points after phagocytosis. The macrophage lysates containing internalized bacteria were diluted in LB medium and plated on an LB plate to determine output colony-forming unit (cfu). For MDC staining, BMDMs were grown on coverslips and treated with bacteria in the same manner as described above. After phagocytosis for 2 h, cells were incubated with 5 μm MDC for 15 min and then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 2 min. The MDC and PI staining were examined under an epifluorescence microscope. Mouse urine was directly aspirated from bladder through a sterile needle and syringe. The urine was serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and spread on yeast extract broth (YEB) plate, which is LB supplemented with 5 g/liter yeast extract and 5 g/liter sucrose. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the number of different colonies was counted, and the cfu/ml was determined. Each colony was characterized by 16 S rDNA sequencing. Briefly, the rDNAs from different colonies were amplified by primer F (5′-TGACGAGTGGCGGACGGGTG-3′) and primer R (5′-CCATGGTGTGACGGGCGGTGTG-3′). The 1.3-kb PCR products were cloned into the pDrive vector and sequenced using primer S (5′-TACGGGAGGCAGCAGTGGGGAATA-3′). The 16 S rDNAs homologies were determined by using the BLAST tool in the Entrez Nucleotide database. 5 × 106 BMDMs from WT and GRIM-19+/− mice were challenged with Staphylococcus saprophyticus for 3 h. Mitochondria from BMDMs were isolated and subjected to NADH oxidation assay as described previously (13Lu H. Cao X. GRIM-19 is essential for maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). For real-time PCR, RNA was first reverse-transcribed using the Expand reverse transcriptase from Roche Applied Science. Real-time PCR was then performed using the cDNA and SYBR Green PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for genes in real-time RT-PCR are: IL-10, forward 5′-AGTGTGTATTGAGTCTGCTGG-3′, reverse 5′-GTACAAACGAGGTTTTCCAAGG-3′; IL-12β, forward 5′-GGCTGCGTAGGTACATTAGC-3′, reverse 5′-CTCTTCAGAGTCAACTTTACAGC-3′; IL-6, forward 5′-AGTGTCACTTGAAATGTTATATG-3′, reverse 5′-CATTGAGGTAAACTTATACATTCC-3′; and TNF-α, forward 5′-GGTGTTCATCCATTCTCTACC-3′, reverse 5′-CTGAGCACAGAGTTGGACTC-3′. Female WT and GRIM-19+/− mice (40 weeks) were anesthetized with ketamine HCL (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg). A 24-gauge polypropylene catheter (EXEL) was transurethrally inserted into bladder. After drainage of the remaining urine in the bladder, 150 μl of DMEM medium containing 1 × 108 of S. saprophyticus was instilled into mouse bladder through a syringe (see Fig. 6A). The syringe was kept on the catheter, allowing the bladder mucus to soak in bacteria solution for 1 h. The catheter was then removed, and the mouse was allowed to void thereafter. Mice bladders were harvested 24 h after infection and sent for histological analysis. Mouse tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissues were cut into 4-μm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E staining). Mouse penis slides were also stained for Gram-positive bacteria by Gram staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer's instructions. Eosin was used for counter staining in Gram staining. Cell migration was quantified in triplicates using the CytoSelectTM 96-well cell migration assay system (Cell Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phagocytosis was quantified in triplicates using the CytoSelectTM 96-well phagocytosis kit (Cell Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total free cellular ATP was measured using bioluminescence assay kit HSII (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes), was used to determine the intracellular ROS levels. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS and then exposed to 5 μm H2DCFH-DA at 37 °C for 1 h. ROS levels were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Biosciences FACScan machine. Mouse IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α were detected by ELISA using the ELISA MAXTM set from BioLegend according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, BMDMs from WT and GRIM-19+/− mice were infected with S. saprophyticus or stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml) with or without MDP (10 μg/ml) for 6 or 20 h. The cell culture medium was harvested and diluted before adding it into ELISA plates, which were coated with capture antibodies. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h to allow the cytokines in the medium to bind to capture antibodies. The cytokines were then detected by detection antibodies and quantified using a microplate reader at A450 nm. Serially diluted cytokine standards were used to generate standard curve in each assay. The results were analyzed with the χ-square test or Mann-Whitney test and Student's t test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. Although GRIM-19 homogeneous knock-out mice (GRIM-19−/−) died in the early stage of embryonic development, the heterozygous mice (GRIM-19+/−) developed normally and were undistinguished from WT mice by appearance and behaviors (12Huang G. Lu H. Hao A. Ng D.C. Ponniah S. Guo K. Lufei C. Zeng Q. Cao X. GRIM-19, a cell death regulatory protein, is essential for assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8447-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, we observed over 2 years that the heterozygous male mice were prone to spontaneous obstructed urinary tract infection (UTI). The infected mice usually presented with a swollen red penis and urinary retention caused by blockage of urethra (Fig. 1A). The urethra was completely obstructed by an eosinophilic and amorphous fibrinoid material that contained bacterial debris as the Gram stain showed the presence of Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1B). At 20 weeks of age, almost all WT mice were healthy (Fig. 1C, maroon bar). However, penis infection and urinary retention were observed in 20% of GRIM-19+/− mice (purple bar). The rate of UTI increased as the mice grew older. At 80 weeks of age, 10% of WT mice developed UTI. In contrast, more than 60% of GRIM-19+/− mice of the same age displayed UTI, which is much higher than that in the WT mice. To identify the bacteria that caused UTI in the mice, we collected urine from bladders of seven GRIM-19+/− mice with urine retention for bacterial culture. Homogenized penis tissue from one of the GRIM-19+/− mice (number 7) was also included for bacterial culture in the same manner as the urine samples. After overnight culture, the bacterial numbers of different colonies were counted to determine the bacterial load in urine. The species of bacteria were identified by 16 S rDNA-based bacterial identification (Table 1). S. saprophyticus caused the majority of cases of UTI in mice. In some mice, Staphylococcus xylosus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis also contributed to the development of UTI. The cfu of S. saprophyticus in the urine culture was very high, ranging from 5.2 to 30.1 × 106. S. saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Studies showed that it is uniquely associated with uncomplicated UTI in humans. It is second to E. coli as the most frequent causative organism of uncomplicated UTIs in young women, although it can also cause UTI in males of all ages (16Raz R. Colodner R. Kunin C.M. Who are you–Staphylococcus saprophyticus?.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2005; 40: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although the WT and GRIM-19+/− mice were kept in the same cages, the infection rate and the bacterial load detected in urine of GRIM-19+/− mice were much higher than those in the WT mice. These data suggest a compromised immunity against bacterial infection in GRIM-19+/− mice.TABLE 1Bacteria isolated from the mice with UTISampleBacteria stains (percentage)Bacteria countscfu/mlUrine 1S. saprophyticus (100%)15.4 ± 106Urine 2S. saprophyticus (100%)7.1 ± 106Urine 3E. faecalis (100%)8.7 ± 106Urine 4S. saprophyticus (82%); S. xylosus (18%)17.5 ± 106Urine 5S. saprophyticus (95%); E. coli (5%)5.2 ± 106Urine 6S. saprophyticus (63%); E. faecalis (37%)30.1 ± 106Urine 7S. saprophyticus (100%)28.6 ± 106Penis 7S. saprophyticus (70%); E. coli (3%); E. faecalis (27%) Open table in a new tab To investigate whether GRIM-19/complex I is directly related to the bacterial infection, we first examined whether bacterial stimulation changed the gene expression of GRIM-19 in BMDMs from WT and GRIM-19+/− mice. The GRIM-19 protein level increased significantly after stimulation with different Staphylococcus strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus in the WT BMDMs as compared with the unstimulated cells (Fig. 2A). The basal level of GRIM-19 was lower in GRIM-19+/− BMDMs, as expected, which was also increased after bacterial stimulation, but in much lower degree in comparison with the WT BMDMs (Fig. 2B). In addition to GRIM-19, the protein level of another complex I subunit, NDUFS3, was also increased after S. saprophyticus infection with little difference between the two cell types. Furthermore, bacterial infection significantly increased the complex I activity in both WT and GRIM-19+/− BMDMs. The level of increase was ∼2-fold in the WT cells as compared with GRIM-19+/− cells (Fig. 2C). However, there is no statistical difference of ATP production between WT and GRIM-19+/− BMDMs, although a trend of decreasing ATP level in GRIM-19+/− BMDMs was observed (Fig. 2D). Last, the ROS was measured in the WT and GRIM-19+/− BMDMs. A higher ROS level was observed in the GRIM-19+/− BMDMs as compared with the WT BMDMs (Fig. 2E, left panel). Bacterial infection did not change the pattern (right panel). Upon bacterial infection, macrophages migrate toward the site of infection and engulf invading bacteria (phagocytosis). The ingested pathogens fuse with a lysosome to be digested. During this process, macrophages produce a number of cytokines and chemokines to trigger inflammation responses. To further dissect the function of GRIM-19 in the bacterial killing, we tested the effects of GRIM-19 reduction in these processes. GRIM-19+/− BMDMs exhibited a normal migration (Fig. 3A) and phagocytosis (Fig. 3B). We also examined the fusion of bacterial phagosome with lysosome by staining the BMDMs with PI, a DNA dye used to visualize the engulfed bacteria, and MDC, used as a lysosome marker (17Høyer-Hansen M. Bastholm L. Mathiasen I.S. Elling F. Jäättelä M. Vitamin D analog EB1089 triggers dramatic lysosomal changes and Beclin 1-mediated autophagic cell death.Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1297-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After 3 h of infection, the majority of engulfed bacteria were fused with lysosome in the WT BMDMs, whereas the fusion occurred only partially in the GRIM-19+/− BMDMs (Fig. 3C). The percentage of colocalization of bacteria (PI) with lysosome (MDC) is presented in Fig. 3D. The results indicated that GRIM-19+/− BMDMs had a decreased capability to deliver the engulfed bacteria to lysosome. In agreement with this result, the bacterial killing ability, determined by the intracellularly living bacterial number after phagocytosis, was also reduced in the GRIM-19+/− BMDMs as compared with the WT BMDMs (Fig. 3E). About 60% of S. saprophyticus was still alive inside GRIM-19+/− BMDMs in comparison with 35% survival rate in the WT BMDMs after phagocytosis for 3 h. After 5 h, the survival rate of S. saprophyticus further decreased to 25% in the GRIM-19+/− BMDMs as compared with 8.5% in the WT cells, so the survival rate is nearly three times higher in the GRIM-19+/− than in the WT cells. This indicates that GRIM-19+/− BMDMs kill bacteria less efficiently than the WT BMDMs. Next, we tested various cytokine productions by ELISA in BMDMs after S. saprophyticus infection. Bacterial stimulation triggered dramatic increase of production of various cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α in both WT and GRIM-19+/− BMDMs (Fig. 4, A–D). Although not much difference in the IL-10 and TNF-α production was observed between WT and GRIM 19+/− BMDMs, GRIM 19+/− BMDMs produced much less IL-12 and IL-6, to a lesser extent, than WT BMDMs upon bacterial stimulation. The cytokine production was also measured at the mRNA level by RT-PCR (Fig. 4E) and real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4F). The results were similar. In addition to IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α, IL-1α, IFN-γ, and IFN-β were also up-regulated by S. saprophyticus infection in the WT and GRIM-19+/− cells. The induction of IL-1α and IFN-γ mRNAs was lower in the GRIM 19+/− BMDMs in comparison with levels in the WT BMDMs, but no obvious difference in IFN-β production was observed in both cell types (Fig. 4E). These data suggest that GRIM-19 knockdown specifically compromised production of certain cytokines in BMDMs upon S. saprophyticus infection. PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) are bacterial products that bind to and activate TLRs localized at cell membranes or the cytosolic NLRs such as nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) and stimulate cytokine production (18Herskovits A.A. Auerbuch V. Portnoy D.A. Bacterial ligands generated in a phagosome are targets of the cytosolic innate immune system.PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To examine the role of GRIM-19 in PAMP-stimulated cytokine production, we also treated WT and GRIM 19+/− BMDMs with LPS (TLR-4 ligand) and MDP (NOD2 ligand). As shown in Fig. 4, A–D, LPS alone or in combination with MDP stimulated the production and secretion of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α. These PAMPs induced the same pattern of cytokine production as the live S. saprophyticus. That was, less IL-12 and IL-6 were produced by treatment with LPS and MDP in GRIM-19+/− BMDMs, and no difference was seen in the production of IL-10 and TNF-α in both BMDMs. These results suggest that GRIM-19 may affect cytokine production via TLR-4 and NOD2 pathways. GRIM-19 is one of the subunits in mitochondrial complex I. To evaluate the role of the mitochondrial RC in bacterial infection-induced cytokine production, we treated the WT BMDMs with RC inhibitors. Rotenone, a specific inhibitor of complex 1, decreased IL-1α, IL-12β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 production upon bacterial stimulation and had no effect on TNF-α production (Fig. 5A), which is similar to the levels in the GRIM-19+/− BMDMs. In comparison with the rotenone treatment, GRIM-19 knockdown has no effect on IL-10 production (Fig. 4). This could be due to a basal complex 1 activity that remained in GRIM-19+/− BMDMs in contrast to a total inhibitory effect by rotenone. Oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V), has a very similar effect on the BMDM cytokine production as rotenone (Fig. 5A). The role of mitochondrial RC on LPS- and MDP-induced cytokine production was also examined. Different concentrations of LPS and MDP induced various productions of cytokine (Fig. 5B). Rotenone inhibited the production of IL-12 family members (IL-12α, IL-12β, IL-23α, and IL-27), IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ, but not TNF-α. Together, these data suggest that the mitochondrial RC is important for the bacterially inducted cytokine production. Bacterial infection triggers inflammatory reaction, which is characterized by an increase in vascular permeability, tissue edema, and neutrophil infiltration. The infiltrating neutrophils kill invading pathogens at the site of infection. The inflammatory responses are accelerated by a variety of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-6. Thus, we checked whether reduction of GRIM-19 affects the bacteria-induced inflammatory response in vivo. We generated an acute bacterial cystitis model by injection of 1 × 108 of S. saprophyticus into mouse bladder (Fig. 6A). The acute inflammatory response in bladder was examined by histological staining 24 h after intravesical instillation of S. saprophyticus. The severity of inflammation was g"
https://openalex.org/W2101466217,"Background Estimating assemblage species or class richness from samples remains a challenging, but essential, goal. Though a variety of statistical tools for estimating species or class richness have been developed, they are all singly-bounded: assuming only a lower bound of species or classes. Nevertheless there are numerous situations, particularly in the cultural realm, where the maximum number of classes is fixed. For this reason, a new method is needed to estimate richness when both upper and lower bounds are known. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we introduce a new method for estimating class richness: doubly-bounded confidence intervals (both lower and upper bounds are known). We specifically illustrate our new method using the Chao1 estimator, rarefaction, and extrapolation, although any estimator of asymptotic richness can be used in our method. Using a case study of Clovis stone tools from the North American Lower Great Lakes region, we demonstrate that singly-bounded richness estimators can yield confidence intervals with upper bound estimates larger than the possible maximum number of classes, while our new method provides estimates that make empirical sense. Conclusions/Significance Application of the new method for constructing doubly-bound richness estimates of Clovis stone tools permitted conclusions to be drawn that were not otherwise possible with singly-bounded richness estimates, namely, that Lower Great Lakes Clovis Paleoindians utilized a settlement pattern that was probably more logistical in nature than residential. However, our new method is not limited to archaeological applications. It can be applied to any set of data for which there is a fixed maximum number of classes, whether that be site occupancy models, commercial products (e.g. athletic shoes), or census information (e.g. nationality, religion, age, race)."
https://openalex.org/W2149022159,"Genome-scale network reconstructions are useful tools for understanding cellular metabolism, and comparisons of such reconstructions can provide insight into metabolic differences between organisms. Recent efforts toward comparing genome-scale models have focused primarily on aligning metabolic networks at the reaction level and then looking at differences and similarities in reaction and gene content. However, these reaction comparison approaches are time-consuming and do not identify the effect network differences have on the functional states of the network. We have developed a bilevel mixed-integer programming approach, CONGA, to identify functional differences between metabolic networks by comparing network reconstructions aligned at the gene level. We first identify orthologous genes across two reconstructions and then use CONGA to identify conditions under which differences in gene content give rise to differences in metabolic capabilities. By seeking genes whose deletion in one or both models disproportionately changes flux through a selected reaction (e.g., growth or by-product secretion) in one model over another, we are able to identify structural metabolic network differences enabling unique metabolic capabilities. Using CONGA, we explore functional differences between two metabolic reconstructions of Escherichia coli and identify a set of reactions responsible for chemical production differences between the two models. We also use this approach to aid in the development of a genome-scale model of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Finally, we propose potential antimicrobial targets in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus based on differences in their metabolic capabilities. Through these examples, we demonstrate that a gene-centric approach to comparing metabolic networks allows for a rapid comparison of metabolic models at a functional level. Using CONGA, we can identify differences in reaction and gene content which give rise to different functional predictions. Because CONGA provides a general framework, it can be applied to find functional differences across models and biological systems beyond those presented here."
https://openalex.org/W1976206034,"Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are promising candidates for cell therapy, as they migrate to areas of injury, differentiate into a broad range of specialized cells, and have immunomodulatory properties. However, MSC are not invisible to the recipient's immune system, and upon in vivo administration, allogeneic MSC are able to trigger immune responses, resulting in rejection of the transplanted cells, precluding their full therapeutic potential. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has developed several strategies to evade cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and Natural Killer (NK) cell recognition. Our goal is to exploit HCMV immunological evasion strategies to reduce MSC immunogenicity. Methodology/Principal Findings We genetically engineered human MSC to express HCMV proteins known to downregulate HLA-I expression, and investigated whether modified MSC were protected from CTL and NK attack. Flow cytometric analysis showed that amongst the US proteins tested, US6 and US11 efficiently reduced MSC HLA-I expression, and mixed lymphocyte reaction demonstrated a corresponding decrease in human and sheep mononuclear cell proliferation. NK killing assays showed that the decrease in HLA-I expression did not result in increased NK cytotoxicity, and that at certain NK∶MSC ratios, US11 conferred protection from NK cytotoxic effects. Transplantation of MSC-US6 or MSC-US11 into pre-immune fetal sheep resulted in increased liver engraftment when compared to control MSC, as demonstrated by qPCR and immunofluorescence analyses. Conclusions and Significance These data demonstrate that engineering MSC to express US6 and US11 can be used as a means of decreasing recognition of MSC by the immune system, allowing higher levels of engraftment in an allogeneic transplantation setting. Since one of the major factors responsible for the failure of allogeneic-donor MSC to engraft is the mismatch of HLA-I molecules between the donor and the recipient, MSC-US6 and MSC-US11 could constitute an off-the-shelf product to overcome donor-recipient HLA-I mismatch."
https://openalex.org/W1979770092,"The furcula displays enormous morphological and structural diversity. Acting as an important origin for flight muscles involved in the downstroke, the form of this element has been shown to vary with flight mode. This study seeks to clarify the strength of this form-function relationship through the use of eigenshape morphometric analysis coupled with recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), including phylogenetic Flexible Discriminant Analysis (pFDA). Additionally, the morphospace derived from the furculae of extant birds is used to shed light on possible flight adaptations of Mesozoic fossil taxa. While broad conclusions of earlier work are supported (U-shaped furculae are associated with soaring, strong anteroposterior curvature with wing-propelled diving), correlations between form and function do not appear to be so clear-cut, likely due to the significantly larger dataset and wider spectrum of flight modes sampled here. Interclavicular angle is an even more powerful discriminator of flight mode than curvature, and is positively correlated with body size. With the exception of the close relatives of modern birds, the ornithuromorphs, Mesozoic taxa tend to occupy unique regions of morphospace, and thus may have either evolved unfamiliar flight styles or have arrived at similar styles through divergent musculoskeletal configurations."
https://openalex.org/W1980085643,"Brca1 deficiency leads to the development of breast cancer. We previously found that Brca1 deficiency activates the Akt oncogenic pathway. Reduced expression of Brca1 was highly correlated with increased activated Akt in human breast cancer samples. Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in Brca1-deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. Defective homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to tumorigenesis in Brca1 deficiency. Here, we show that Akt1 promotes chromosome instability in Brca1-deficent cells. DNA breaks in Brca1-deficent cells are aberrantly joined into complex chromosome rearrangements by a process dependent on Akt1. Depletion of Akt1 increases HR in Brca1-mutant cells, which is rescued by expression of wild-type, but not mutant Akt1 with deletion of Brca1-binding domain. Mechanistically, activated Akt1 in Brca1-deficient cells impairs Chk1 nuclear localization and subsequently disrupts interaction of Chk1 and Rad51 leading to HR defects. Our results indicate that Brca1 deficiency might activate Akt1 contributing to tumorigenesis through regulation of the Chk1-Rad51 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2071071282,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. To date, glycosylation patterns of glycoproteins in fluids of ALS patients have not been described. Moreover, the aberrant glycosylation related to the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases encouraged us to explore the glycome of ALS patient sera. We found high levels of sialylated glycans and low levels of core fucosylated glycans in serum-derived N-glycans of patients with ALS, compared to healthy volunteer sera. Based on these results, we analyzed the IgG Fc N(297)-glycans, as IgG are major serum glycoproteins affected by sialylation or core fucosylation and are found in the motor cortex of ALS patients. The analyses revealed a distinct glycan, A2BG2, in IgG derived from ALS patient sera (ALS-IgG). This glycan increases the affinity of IgG to CD16 on effector cells, consequently enhancing Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). Therefore, we explore whether the Fc-N(297)-glycans of IgG may be involved in ALS disease. Immunostaining of brain and spinal cord tissues revealed over-expression of CD16 and co-localization of intact ALS-IgG with CD16 and in brain with activated microglia of G93A-SOD1 mice. Intact ALS-IgG enhanced effector cell activation and ADCC reaction in comparison to sugar-depleted or control IgG. ALS-IgG were localized in the synapse between brain microglia and neurons of G93A-SOD1 mice, manifesting a promising in vivo ADCC reaction. Therefore, glycans of ALS-IgG may serve as a biomarker for the disease and may be involved in neuronal damage."
https://openalex.org/W4248147052,"The RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is a repressor of neuronal differentiation and its elevated expression in neural cells blocks neuronal differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate a role for REST in the control of proliferation of medulloblastoma cells. REST expression decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)NIB/p27, a CDK inhibitor and a brake of cell proliferation in these cells. The reciprocal relationship between REST and p27 was validated in human tumor samples. REST knockdown in medulloblastoma cells derepessed a novel REST target gene encoding the deubiquitylase ubiquitin (Ub)-specific peptidase 37 (USP37). Ectopically expressed wild-type USP37 formed a complex with p27, promoted its deubiquitination and stabilization and blocked cell proliferation. Knockdown of REST and USP37 prevented p27 stabilization and blocked the diminution in proliferative potential that normally accompanied REST loss. Unexpectedly, wild-type USP37 expression also induced the expression of REST-target neuronal differentiation genes even though REST levels were unaffected. In contrast, a mutant of USP37 carrying a site-directed change in a conserved cysteine failed to rescue REST-mediated p27 destabilization, maintenance of cell proliferation and blockade to neuronal differentiation. Consistent with these findings, a significant correlation between USP37 and p27 was observed in patient tumors. Collectively, these findings provide a novel connection between REST and the proteasomal machinery in the control of p27 and cell proliferation in medulloblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2012459754,"During lung development, cells proliferate for a defined length of time before they begin to differentiate. Factors that control this proliferative process and how this growth process is related to lung cancer are currently unknown. Here, we found that the WD40-containing protein (p44/wdr77) was expressed in growing epithelial cells at the early stages of lung development. In contrast, p44/wdr77 expression was diminished in fully differentiated epithelial cells in the adult lung. Loss of p44/wdr77 gene expression led to cell growth arrest and differentiation. Re-expression of p44/wdr77 caused terminally differentiated cells to re-enter the cell cycle. Our findings suggest that p44/wdr77 is essential and sufficient for proliferation of lung epithelial cells. P44/Wdr77 was re-expressed in lung cancer, and silencing p44/wdr77 expression strongly inhibited growth of lung adenocarcinoma cells in tissue culture and abolished growth of lung adenocarcinoma tumor xenografts in mice. The growth arrest induced by loss of p44/wdr77 expression was partially through the p21–Rb signaling. Our results suggest that p44/wdr77 controls cellular proliferation during lung development, and this growth process is reactivated during lung tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2026899679,"The role of genetic modifications of the TRPA1 receptor has been well documented in inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We recently reported that the E179K variant of TRPA1 appears to be crucial for the generation of paradoxical heat sensation in pain patients. Here, we describe the consequences of the single amino acid exchange at position 179 in the ankyrin repeat 4 of human TRPA1. TRPA1 wild type Lys-179 protein expressed in HEK cells exhibited intact biochemical properties, inclusive trafficking into the plasma membrane, formation of large protein complexes, and the ability to be activated by cold. Additionally, a strong increase of Lys-179 protein expression was observed in cold (4 °C) and heat (49 °C)-treated cells. In contrast, HEK cells expressing the variant Lys-179 TRPA1 failed to get activated by cold possibly due to the loss of ability to interact with other proteins or other TRPA1 monomers during oligomerization. In conclusion, the detailed understanding of TRPA1 genetic variants might provide a fruitful strategy for future development of pain treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2036557102,"The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, hAgo, or Fbw7) is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and targets a group of oncoproteins for degradation. We now show that Fbxw7 regulates the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes by mediating the degradation of c-Myc and Notch proteins. Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes showed an increased proliferative capacity that was dependent on the accumulation of c-Myc but not on that of Notch. Fbxw7 deficiency also resulted in the premature differentiation of keratinocytes in a manner dependent on both c-Myc and Notch. Although Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes proliferated excessively in vitro, loss of Fbxw7 did not predispose keratinocytes to the formation of squamous cell carcinoma in vivo induced by the expression of oncogenic Ras, possibly because the stem cell population of keratinocytes becomes exhausted as a result of enhanced Notch activity. Indeed, suppression of Notch signaling by additional ablation of RBP-J in Fbxw7-deficient keratinocytes conferred a more aggressive tumorigenic capacity. Collectively, these results indicate that Fbxw7 controls the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, and that it exerts both inhibitory and stimulatory actions in skin carcinogenesis by counteracting the proliferation-promoting effect of c-Myc and the tumor-suppressive effect of Notch, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1999542125,"Changes in the levels of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) can alter the function of several types of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules by causing altered N-linked glycan branching. Using a her-2 mammary tumor mouse model, her-2 receptor signaling was down-regulated by GnT-V knock-out, resulting in a significant delay in the onset of her-2-induced mammary tumors. To identify the genes that contributed to this GnT-V regulation of early events in tumorigenesis, microarray analysis was performed using her-2 induced mammary tumors from wild-type and GnT-V-null mice. We found that 142 genes were aberrantly expressed (>2.0-fold) with 64 genes up-regulated and 78 genes down-regulated after deletion of GnT-V. Among differentially expressed genes, the expression of a subgroup of the cadherin superfamily, the protocadherin β (Pcdhβ) cluster, was up-regulated in GnT-V-null tumors. Altered expression of the Pcdhβ cluster in GnT-V-null tumors was not due to changes in promoter methylation; instead, impaired her-2-mediated signaling pathways were implicated at least in part resulting from reduced microRNA-21 expression. Overexpression of Pcdhβ genes inhibited tumor cell growth, decreased the proportion of tumor-initiating cells, and decreased tumor formation in vivo, demonstrating that expression of the Pcdhβ gene cluster can serve as an inhibitor of the transformed phenotype. Our results suggest the up-regulation of the Pcdhβ gene cluster as a mechanism for reduced her-2-mediated tumorigenesis resulting from GnT-V deletion."
https://openalex.org/W2066617977,"Tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in DNA damage responses in metazoa, yet more than half of human tumors show p53 deficiencies. Therefore, understanding how therapeutic genotoxins such as ionizing radiation (IR) can elicit DNA damage responses in a p53-independent manner is of clinical importance. Drosophila has been a good model to study the effects of IR because DNA damage responses as well as underlying genes are conserved in this model, and because streamlined gene families make loss-of-function analyses feasible. Indeed, Drosophila is the only genetically tractable model for IR-induced, p53-independent apoptosis and for tissue regeneration and homeostasis after radiation damage. While these phenomenon occur only in the larvae, all genome-wide gene expression analyses after irradiation to date have been in embryos. We report here the first analysis of IR-induced, genome-wide gene expression changes in wild type and p53 mutant Drosophila larvae. Key data from microarrays were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. The results solidify the central role of p53 in IR-induced transcriptome changes, but also show that nearly all changes are made of both p53-dependent and p53-independent components. p53 is found to be necessary not just for the induction of but also for the repression of transcript levels for many genes in response to IR. Furthermore, Functional analysis of one of the top-changing genes, EF1a-100E, implicates it in repression of IR-induced p53-independent apoptosis. These and other results support the emerging notion that there is not a single dominant mechanism but that both positive and negative inputs collaborate to induce p53-independent apoptosis in response to IR in Drosophila larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2044945839,"We have previously identified a Rho protein, RhoD, which localizes to the plasma membrane and the early endocytic compartment. Here, we show that a GTPase-deficient mutant of RhoD, RhoDG26V, causes hyperplasia and perturbed differentiation of the epidermis, when targeted to the skin of transgenic mice. In vitro, gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches revealed that RhoD is involved in the regulation of G1/S-phase progression and causes overduplication of centrosomes. Centriole overduplication assays in aphidicolin-arrested p53-deficient U2OS cells, in which the cell and the centrosome cycles are uncoupled, revealed that the effects of RhoD and its mutants on centrosome duplication and cell cycle are independent. Enhancement of G1/S-phase progression was mediated via Diaph1, a novel effector of RhoD, which we have identified using a two-hybrid screen. These results indicate that RhoD participates in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2107374848,"It has long been argued that the form of North American Paleoindian points was affected by hafting. According to this hypothesis, hafting constrained point bases such that they are less variable than point blades. The results of several studies have been claimed to be consistent with this hypothesis. However, there are reasons to be skeptical of these results. None of the studies employed statistical tests, and all of them focused on points recovered from kill and camp sites, which makes it difficult to be certain that the differences in variability are the result of hafting rather than a consequence of resharpening. Here, we report a study in which we tested the predictions of the hafting hypothesis by statistically comparing the variability of different parts of Clovis points. We controlled for the potentially confounding effects of resharpening by analyzing largely unused points from caches as well as points from kill and camp sites. The results of our analyses were not consistent with the predictions of the hypothesis. We found that several blade characters and point thickness were no more variable than the base characters. Our results indicate that the hafting hypothesis does not hold for Clovis points and indicate that there is a need to test its applicability in relation to post-Clovis Paleoindian points."
https://openalex.org/W2049307463,"Context Expression and activity of the main lipogenic enzymes is paradoxically decreased in obesity, but the mechanisms behind these findings are poorly known. Breast Cancer 1 (BrCa1) interacts with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) reducing the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate BrCa1 in human adipose tissue according to obesity and insulin resistance, and in vitro cultured adipocytes. Research Design and Methods BrCa1 gene expression, total and phosphorylated (P-) BrCa1, and ACC were analyzed in adipose tissue samples obtained from a total sample of 133 subjects. BrCa1 expression was also evaluated during in vitro differentiation of human adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells. Results BrCa1 gene expression was significantly up-regulated in both omental (OM; 1.36-fold, p = 0.002) and subcutaneous (SC; 1.49-fold, p = 0.001) adipose tissue from obese subjects. In parallel with increased BrCa1 mRNA, P-ACC was also up-regulated in SC (p = 0.007) as well as in OM (p = 0.010) fat from obese subjects. Consistent with its role limiting fatty acid biosynthesis, both BrCa1 mRNA (3.5-fold, p<0.0001) and protein (1.2-fold, p = 0.001) were increased in pre-adipocytes, and decreased during in vitro adipogenesis, while P-ACC decreased during differentiation of human adipocytes (p = 0.005) allowing lipid biosynthesis. Interestingly, BrCa1 gene expression in mature adipocytes was restored by inflammatory stimuli (macrophage conditioned medium), whereas lipogenic genes significantly decreased. Conclusions The specular findings of BrCa1 and lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue and adipocytes reported here suggest that BrCa1 might help to control fatty acid biosynthesis in adipocytes and adipose tissue from obese subjects."
https://openalex.org/W2017025914,"AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-UTR of unstable transcripts play a vital role in the regulation of many inflammatory mediators. To identify novel ARE-dependent gene regulators, we screened a human leukocyte cDNA library for candidates that enhanced the activity of a luciferase reporter bearing the ARE sequence from TNF (ARE(TNF)). Among 171 hits, we focused on Zfand5 (zinc finger, AN1-type domain 5), a 23-kDa protein containing two zinc finger domains. Zfand5 expression was induced in macrophages in response to IFNγ and Toll-like receptor ligands. Knockdown of Zfand5 in macrophages decreased expression of ARE class II transcripts TNF and COX2, whereas overexpression stabilized TNF mRNA by suppressing deadenylation. Zfand5 specifically bound to ARE(TNF) mRNA and competed with tristetraprolin, a protein known to bind and destabilize class II ARE-containing RNAs. Truncation studies indicated that both zinc fingers of Zfand5 contributed to its mRNA-stabilizing function. These findings add Zfand5 to the growing list of RNA-binding proteins and suggest that Zfand5 can enhance ARE-containing mRNA stability by competing with tristetraprolin for mRNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1964333107,"The expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype, alpha7, was investigated in the developing teeth of mice that were modified through homologous recombination to express a bi-cistronic IRES-driven tau-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP); alpha7GFP) or IRES-Cre (alpha7Cre). The expression of alpha7GFP was detected first in cells of the condensing mesenchyme at embryonic (E) day E13.5 where it intensifies through E14.5. This expression ends abruptly at E15.5, but was again observed in ameloblasts of incisors at E16.5 or molar ameloblasts by E17.5–E18.5. This expression remains detectable until molar enamel deposition is completed or throughout life as in the constantly erupting mouse incisors. The expression of alpha7GFP also identifies all stages of innervation of the tooth organ. Ablation of the alpha7-cell lineage using a conditional alpha7Cre×ROSA26-LoxP(diphtheria toxin A) strategy substantially reduced the mesenchyme and this corresponded with excessive epithelium overgrowth consistent with an instructive role by these cells during ectoderm patterning. However, alpha7knock-out (KO) mice exhibited normal tooth size and shape indicating that under normal conditions alpha7 expression is dispensable to this process. The function of ameloblasts in alpha7KO mice is altered relative to controls. High resolution micro-computed tomography analysis of adult mandibular incisors revealed enamel volume of the alpha7KO was significantly reduced and the organization of enamel rods was altered relative to controls. These results demonstrate distinct and varied spatiotemporal expression of alpha7 during tooth development, and they suggest that dysfunction of this receptor would have diverse impacts upon the adult organ."
https://openalex.org/W2001565430,"The cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) involved in visual transduction in photoreceptor cells contains two inhibitory γ-subunits (Pγ) which bind to the catalytic core (Pαβ) to inhibit catalysis and stimulate cGMP binding to the GAF domains of Pαβ. During visual excitation, interaction of activated transducin with Pγ relieves inhibition. Pγ also participates in a complex with RGS9-1 and other proteins to accelerate the GTPase activity of activated transducin. We studied the structural determinants for these important functions of Pγ. First, we identified two important sites in the middle region of Pγ (amino acids 27-38 and 52-54) that significantly stabilize the overall binding affinity of Pγ with Pαβ. The ability of Pγ to stimulate noncatalytic cGMP binding to the GAF domains of PDE6 has been localized to amino acids 27-30 of Pγ. Transducin activation of PDE6 catalysis critically depends on the presence of Ile54 in the glycine-rich region of Pγ in order to relieve inhibition of catalysis. The central glycine-rich region of Pγ is also required for transducin to increase cGMP exchange at the GAF domains. Finally, Thr-65 and/or Val-66 of Pγ are critical residues for Pγ to stimulate GTPase activity of transducin in a complex with RGS9-1. We propose that the glycine-rich region of Pγ is a primary docking site for PDE6-interacting proteins involved in the activation/inactivation pathways of visual transduction. This functional mapping of Pγ with its binding partners demonstrates the remarkable versatility of this multifunctional protein and its central role in regulating the activation and lifetime of visual transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2052441634,"Techniques employed in rehabilitation of visual field disorders such as hemianopia are usually based on either visual or audio-visual stimulation and patients have to perform a training task. Here we present results from a completely different, novel approach that was based on passive unimodal auditory stimulation. Ten patients with either left or right-sided pure hemianopia (without neglect) received one hour of unilateral passive auditory stimulation on either their anopic or their intact side by application of repetitive trains of sound pulses emitted simultaneously via two loudspeakers. Immediately before and after passive auditory stimulation as well as after a period of recovery, patients completed a simple visual task requiring detection of light flashes presented along the horizontal plane in total darkness. The results showed that one-time passive auditory stimulation on the side of the blind, but not of the intact, hemifield of patients with hemianopia induced an improvement in visual detections by almost 100% within 30 min after passive auditory stimulation. This enhancement in performance was reversible and was reduced to baseline 1.5 h later. A non-significant trend of a shift of the visual field border toward the blind hemifield was obtained after passive auditory stimulation. These results are compatible with the view that passive auditory stimulation elicited some activation of the residual visual pathways, which are known to be multisensory and may also be sensitive to unimodal auditory stimuli as were used here.

Uncovering the genetic basis of the model may unravel the mechanism of antidepressant treatment.FVB/NJ (FVB) and C57BL/6J (B6) were first identified as the response and non-response strains to fluoxetine (a serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor antidepressant) treatment in the mouse FST. Simple-interval (SIM) and composite-interval (CIM) mappings were applied to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of the anti-immobility effect of fluoxetine in FST (FST(FLX)) in 865 male B6×FVB-F2 mice. The brain mRNA expressions of the gene with the maximum QTL-linkage signal for FST(FLX) after the FST were compared between B6 and FVB mice and also compared between fluoxetine and saline treatment. The association of the variants in the human homologue of the mouse FST(FLX)-QTL gene with major depressive disorder (MDD) and antidepressant response were investigated in 1080 human subjects (MDD/control = 582/498).One linkage signal for FST(FLX)-QTL was detected at an intronic SNP (rs6215396) of the mouse Zfp326 gene (maximal CIM-LOD = 9.36). The Zfp326 mRNA expression in the FVB thalamus was significantly down-regulated by fluoxetine in the FST, and the higher FVB-to-B6 Zfp326 mRNA expressions in the frontal cortex, striatum and hypothalamus diminished after fluoxetine treatment. Two coding-synonymous SNPs (rs2816881 and rs10922744) in the human homologue of Zfp326, ZNF326, were significantly associated with the 8-week antidepressant treatment response in the MDD patients (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.004-0.028).The findings suggest the involvement of the Zfp326 and ZNF326 genes in antidepressant treatment response."
https://openalex.org/W2015759727,"Computer simulation techniques for cardiac beating motions potentially have many applications and a broad audience. However, most existing methods require enormous computational costs and often show unstable behavior for extreme parameter sets, which interrupts smooth simulation study and make it difficult to apply them to interactive applications. To address this issue, we present an efficient and robust framework for simulating the cardiac beating motion. The global cardiac motion is generated by the accumulation of local myocardial fiber contractions. We compute such local-to-global deformations using a kinematic approach; we divide a heart mesh model into overlapping local regions, contract them independently according to fiber orientation, and compute a global shape that satisfies contracted shapes of all local regions as much as possible. A comparison between our method and a physics-based method showed that our method can generate motion very close to that of a physics-based simulation. Our kinematic method has high controllability; the simulated ventricle-wall-contraction speed can be easily adjusted to that of a real heart by controlling local contraction timing. We demonstrate that our method achieves a highly realistic beating motion of a whole heart in real time on a consumer-level computer. Our method provides an important step to bridge a gap between cardiac simulations and interactive applications."
https://openalex.org/W2033010072,"Many wild ruminants such as Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) are susceptible to Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection, which causes disease mainly in domestic sheep and cattle. Outbreaks involving either BTV serotypes 1 (BTV-1) and 8 (BTV-8) are currently challenging Europe. Inclusion of wildlife vaccination among BTV control measures should be considered in certain species. In the present study, four out of fifteen seronegative Spanish ibexes were immunized with a single dose of inactivated vaccine against BTV-1, four against BTV-8 and seven ibexes were non vaccinated controls. Seven ibexes (four vaccinated and three controls) were inoculated with each BTV serotype. Antibody and IFN-gamma responses were evaluated until 28 days after inoculation (dpi). The vaccinated ibexes showed significant (P<0.05) neutralizing antibody levels after vaccination compared to non vaccinated ibexes. The non vaccinated ibexes remained seronegative until challenge and showed neutralizing antibodies from 7 dpi. BTV RNA was detected in the blood of non vaccinated ibexes from 2 to the end of the study (28 dpi) and in target tissue samples obtained at necropsy (8 and 28 dpi). BTV-1 was successfully isolated on cell culture from blood and target tissues of non vaccinated ibexes. Clinical signs were unapparent and no gross lesions were found at necropsy. Our results show for the first time that Spanish ibex is susceptible and asymptomatic to BTV infection and also that a single dose of vaccine prevents viraemia against BTV-1 and BTV-8 replication."
https://openalex.org/W2166801479,"Although 14-3-3 proteins participate in multiple biological processes, isoform-specific specialized functions, as well as functional redundancy are emerging with tissue and developmental stage-specificity. Accordingly, the two 14-3-3ε proteins in Drosophila exhibit functional specificity and redundancy. Homozygotes for loss of function alleles of D14-3-3ε contain significantly fewer germ line cells (pole cells) in their gonads, a phenotype not shared by mutants in the other 14-3-3 gene leo. We show that although D14-3-3ε is enriched within pole cells it is required in mesodermal somatic gonad precursor cells which guide pole cells in their migration through the mesoderm and coalesce with them to form the embryonic gonad. Loss of D14-3-3ε results in defective pole cell migration, reduced pole cell number. We present evidence that D14-3-3ε loss results in reduction or loss of the transcription factor Zfh-1, one of the main regulatory molecules of the pole cell migration, from the somatic gonad precursor cells."

https://openalex.org/W1988487454,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is a potentially curative therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect can eradicate residual leukemia after allo-SCT. Ph(+) leukemia cells frequently express death-inducing receptors (DR4 and DR5) for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is one of the cytotoxic ligands expressed on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells mediating the GVL effect. Here we demonstrate that imatinib specifically downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in cell lines and clinical samples of Ph(+) leukemia. Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) and short hairpin RNA against bcr-abl also downregulated DR4 and DR5 expression in Ph(+) leukemia cells, and transfection of bcr-abl into a Ph(−) leukemia cell line induced DR4 and DR5 expression, which was abrogated by imatinib treatment. Accordingly, Ph(+) leukemia cells that had been pretreated with imatinib showed resistance to the pro-apoptotic activity of recombinant human soluble TRAIL. These observations demonstrate that BCR-ABL is critically involved in the leukemia-specific expression of DR4 and DR5 and in the susceptibility of Ph(+) leukemia to TRAIL-mediated anti-leukemic activity, providing new insight into the mechanisms of the tumor-specific cytotoxic activities of TRAIL."
