https://openalex.org/W2030628997,"The existence of curious materials called 'half metals' is predicted: they are metallic only for half of the available free electrons, namely those in a particular spin orientation. For the other half of electrons, with the opposite spin, a half-metal is insulating. There is some experimental evidence for half-metallic behaviour, and substantial efforts are being made to find such materials that could be of practical use in spintronics. Based on first-principles calculations, Son et al. predict half-metallic behaviour in nanometre-scale ribbons of graphene. The property emerges when homogeneous electric fields are applied across the nanoribbons, with the zigzag-shaped edges attached to the voltage contacts. This work could be a step towards graphene-based nanospintronics. First-principles calculations predict that half-metallic behaviour can be found in nanometre-scale ribbons of graphene, in practically realistic conditions. The property emerges when homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and it can be controlled by the external electric fields. Electrical current can be completely spin polarized in a class of materials known as half-metals, as a result of the coexistence of metallic nature for electrons with one spin orientation and insulating nature for electrons with the other. Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been predicted for some ferromagnetic metals—for example, the Heusler compounds1—and were first observed in a manganese perovskite2. In view of the potential for use of this property in realizing spin-based electronics, substantial efforts have been made to search for half-metallic materials3,4. However, organic materials have hardly been investigated in this context even though carbon-based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic devices5. Here we predict half-metallicity in nanometre-scale graphene ribbons by using first-principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable if in-plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped edges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic properties can be controlled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of scientific interest in the interplay between electric fields and electronic spin degree of freedom in solids6,7 but may also open a new path to explore spintronics3 at the nanometre scale, based on graphene8,9,10,11."
https://openalex.org/W2065379666,"The pursuit of responsible nanotechnologies can be tackled through a series of grand challenges, argue Andrew D. Maynard and his co-authors. The spectre of possible harm — real or imagined — is threatening to slow the development of nanotechnology. In a Commentary this week a group of nanotechnologists outlines a series of five “grand challenges”. If they and their colleagues can rise to these challenges — which include development of new ways of measuring exposure to nanomaterials and assessing the health and environmental impact of that exposure — the true extent of any risks involved should become clear."

The only animal model specifically reproducing the alterations in the dystrophin gene and the full spectrum of human pathology is the golden retriever dog model. Affected animals present a single mutation in intron 6, resulting in complete absence of the dystrophin protein, and early and severe muscle degeneration with nearly complete loss of motility and walking ability. Death usually occurs at about 1 year of age as a result of failure of respiratory muscles. Here we report that intra-arterial delivery of wild-type canine mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated stem cells) results in an extensive recovery of dystrophin expression, normal muscle morphology and function (confirmed by measurement of contraction force on single fibres). The outcome is a remarkable clinical amelioration and preservation of active motility. These data qualify mesoangioblasts as candidates for future stem cell therapy for Duchenne patients. There is still no effective treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but new work has identified a promising cell type for future stem cell therapy, and establishes a logical basis for clinical experimentation with these cells. The work involves the successful transplantation of wild-type canine mesoangioblasts (vessel-associated stem cells) in the golden retriever dystrophic dog, the only large animal model of muscular dystrophy relevant to human pathology. There was dramatic improvement in both structure and function of the transplanted muscles, increased dystrophin expression in muscle fibres, and an unprecedented level of amelioration of spontaneous motility."

https://openalex.org/W2114976667,"Neanderthals are the extinct hominid group most closely related to contemporary humans, so their genome offers a unique opportunity to identify genetic changes specific to anatomically fully modern humans. We have identified a 38,000-year-old Neanderthal fossil that is exceptionally free of contamination from modern human DNA. Direct high-throughput sequencing of a DNA extract from this fossil has thus far yielded over one million base pairs of hominoid nuclear DNA sequences. Comparison with the human and chimpanzee genomes reveals that modern human and Neanderthal DNA sequences diverged on average about 500,000 years ago. Existing technology and fossil resources are now sufficient to initiate a Neanderthal genome-sequencing effort."

https://openalex.org/W2057558367,"Argonaute (AGO) proteins interact with small RNAs to mediate gene silencing. C. elegans contains 27 AGO genes, raising the question of what roles these genes play in RNAi and related gene-silencing pathways. Here we describe 31 deletion alleles representing all of the previously uncharacterized AGO genes. Analysis of single- and multiple-AGO mutant strains reveals functions in several pathways, including (1) chromosome segregation, (2) fertility, and (3) at least two separate steps in the RNAi pathway. We show that RDE-1 interacts with trigger-derived sense and antisense RNAs to initiate RNAi, while several other AGO proteins interact with amplified siRNAs to mediate downstream silencing. Overexpression of downstream AGOs enhances silencing, suggesting that these proteins are limiting for RNAi. Interestingly, these AGO proteins lack key residues required for mRNA cleavage. Our findings support a two-step model for RNAi, in which functionally and structurally distinct AGOs act sequentially to direct gene silencing."

https://openalex.org/W2159997339,"The pathways that distinguish transport of folded and misfolded cargo through the exocytic (secretory) pathway of eukaryotic cells remain unknown. Using proteomics to assess global cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein interactions (the CFTR interactome), we show that Hsp90 cochaperones modulate Hsp90-dependent stability of CFTR protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Cell-surface rescue of the most common disease variant that is restricted to the ER, DeltaF508, can be initiated by partial siRNA silencing of the Hsp90 cochaperone ATPase regulator Aha1. We propose that failure of DeltaF508 to achieve an energetically favorable fold in response to the steady-state dynamics of the chaperone folding environment (the ""chaperome"") is responsible for the pathophysiology of CF. The activity of cargo-associated chaperome components may be a common mechanism regulating folding for ER exit, providing a general framework for correction of misfolding disease."

https://openalex.org/W2009577529,"The liver X receptors, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. LXRs play a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid metabolism. In addition, oral administration of LXR agonists to mice results in elevated hepatic fatty acid synthesis and steatosis and increased secretion of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein resulting in hypertriglyceridemia. This increased hepatic lipogenesis has been largely attributed to the LXR-dependent up-regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) expression. However, it has been reported that treating Srebp-1c null mice with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 still results in enhanced expression of many lipogenic genes, suggesting additional mechanisms by which LXR can enhance hepatic lipogenesis. In this report, we identify the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) as an LXR target that independently enhances the up-regulation of select lipogenic genes. The ChREBP promoter contains functional LXR-binding sites that confer receptor-dependent binding and transactivation. We show that T0901317 treatment of mice is associated with up-regulation of the ChREBP target gene, liver-type pyruvate kinase. Therefore, activation of LXR not only increases ChREBP mRNA via enhanced transcription but also modulates ChREBP activity. This establishes LXR as a master lipogenic transcription factor, as it directly regulates both SREBP-1c and ChREBP to enhance hepatic fatty acid synthesis.

LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2) are sterol sensors and bind oxysterols to regulate genes critical to cholesterol efflux (ABCA1, ABCG1, and apoE), cholesterol conversion to bile acids (CYP7A1), and cholesterol secretion into bile for excretion (ABCG5/G8) (3Repa J.J.

As such, these receptors have been evaluated as potential therapeutic targets to alleviate conditions associated with hypercholesterolemia (e.g. atherosclerosis (4Tontonoz P. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol.

SREBP-1c is a direct target gene of the retinoid X receptor (RXR)/LXR heterodimer, and two LXR-responsive elements (LXREs) critical to RXR/LXR-mediated regulation have been identified in the promoter of this gene (9Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J.-I. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c is a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family, and has been shown to control the expression of nearly all genes integral to fatty acid biosynthesis (11Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3715) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Srebp-1c gene in mice results in a 50% reduction in hepatic fatty acid synthesis rates. However, treating Srebp-1c null mice with an LXR agonist still results in the up-regulation of a subset of lipogenic genes and a modest increase in fatty acid synthesis, suggesting that additional mechanisms exist to link LXR activity and lipogenesis (12Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) as a novel LXR target gene. ChREBP is a glucose-sensitive transcription factor that promotes the hepatic conversion of excess carbohydrate to lipid (13Yamashita H. Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruick R.K. Henzel W.J.

Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). LXR and RXR agonists specifically induce expression of ChREBP in wild-type, but not Lxrα/β-double knock-out mice. This increase in ChREBP mRNA is dependent on two LXREs in the promoter of the ChREBP gene. In addition to an increase in hepatic ChREBP mRNA, there is a concomitant increase in liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) mRNA indicative of increased ChREBP activity. Therefore, future studies aimed at identifying selective LXR modulators, drugs that contain the beneficial cholesterol-lowering properties of LXR agonists with minimal impact on lipogenesis, will need to address the effects of these selective LXR modulators on both SREBP-1c and ChREBP activity.

Real-time PCR reagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled room (23 ± 1 °C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle and all experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Male Agouti 129/SvJ mice at 3 months of age were provided with the meal form of a standard rodent diet (diet number 7001, Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets, Madison, WI) supplemented with various nuclear receptor agonists, during a 12-h dark cycle.

Male mixed strain (C57Bl/6 and A129/SvJ) wild-type and Lxrα/β-double knock-out mice were fed the basal rodent diet supplemented with 0.2% (w/w) cholesterol and either LG268 (RXR agonist, 30 mpk) or T0901317 (LXR agonist, 50 mpk) for 12 h or 10 days. At the end of the dietary treatments, mice were anesthetized, exsanguinated via the descending vena cava, and tissues removed and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from tissue samples using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Northern Analysis—Equal quantities of total RNA from the samples of each group were pooled and poly(A)+ RNA was purified using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (GE Healthcare). mRNA (5 μg/lane) was size fractionated on a 1% formaldehydeagarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane (Zetaprobe, Bio-Rad) for detection using 32P-labeled cDNAs. The ChREBP cDNA probe was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers: forward, 5′-catcgatcacaggtcatcc; and reverse, 5′-ttgttgttgtctacacgacc, resulting in a PCR product spanning nucleotides 134-1983 (GenBank™ NM_021455). The rat cyclophilin cDNA was kindly provided by David Russell, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Quantitative Real-time PCR—qRT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT sequence detection system as described (16Kurrasch D.M. Huang J. Wilkie T.M. Repa J.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Primers for each gene were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and validated by analysis of template titration and dissociation curves. Primer sequences are provided in supplementary Table 1. Results of qRT-PCR were evaluated by the comparative CT method (user bulletin No. 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using cyclophilin as the invariant control gene. RNA levels are expressed relative to those of the wild-type mice fed the basal diet, and reflect the average ± S.E. for 4-6 mice/group. RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) to define the transcriptional start site. Briefly, total RNA isolated from T0901317-treated mouse liver was used in this procedure in conjunction with a reverse ChREBP-specific primer 1 (5′-gccaggctcaagcactcgaagag). Various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of mouse ChREBP were amplified by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and subcloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid thereby replacing the thymidine kinase promoter (17Willy P.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing putative LXRE sites were annealed and subcloned into the HindIII site upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter of the luciferase plasmid. Site-directed mutagenesis of the ChBP-3801/+9 plasmid was accomplished using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of each plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection of HepG2 or human embryonic kidney 293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). 14 h after introducing DNA, cells were exposed to T0901317 (1 μm), LG268 (100 nm), or vehicle for 18-24 h. Cells were lysed and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as previously described (18Zhang Y. Repa J.J. Gauthier K. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol.

RXRα and LXRα protein-containing reticulocyte lysates were generated using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). Annealed oligonucleotide probes were labeled with Klenow enzyme (Roche) in the presence of [32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl consisting of 75 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 2 μl of nuclear receptor lysates or unprogrammed lysates. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Frozen, powdered liver tissue was fixed by addition of warmed formaldehyde (37 °C, 1% final concentration), then incubated 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking was stopped by addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation and washing the pellet once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.

The pellet was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (Upstate), and DNA was sheared by sonication to an average length of ∼800 bp. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and protein concentration measured by BCA kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed using the Upstate chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit. 2400 μg (200 μl) of sample was diluted into 2.4 ml with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer and precleared with protein A-agarose beads. 60 μl was withdrawn for input DNA. The supernatant (600 μl) was incubated with 20 μg of LXRα/β (S-20) antibody (Santa Cruz, SC-1000) at 4 °C, overnight. Antibody-protein-DNA complex was pulled down with protein A-agarose beads, and washed sequentially with low-salt, high-salt, and lithium washing buffers, then twice with 10 mm Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0). Protein-DNA complex was obtained by incubation in elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at room temperature for 15 min. DNA-protein cross-links of the eluate were reversed in 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 16 h. Proteins were digested by proteinase K (Roche) at 45 °C for 2 h. Immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of glycogen. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 70 μl of H2O, and 3 μl were used as template for PCR. Primers for ChIP assays for conventional PCR and gel-based evaluation of ChIP results are as follows: LXRE-sense, 5′-tctgtggatcgtgaaccctattt, LXRE-antisense 5′-ttcgtcctcgggtggcaacgggggaca; NS-sense, 5′-attccctagctgggatcctagactgtg, NS-antisense 5′-tatctgatctattgtccactcagctgttcatc.

Antibodies and Immunoblot Assay—Livers were lysed in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyro-phosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and briefly centrifuged. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard. 60 μg of protein were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) (number 2532) and phospho-AMPKα/Thr172 (number 2531) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and used with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. for each treatment group. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. If unequal variance was indicated by Bartlett's test, log transformation was performed prior to statistical analysis. As fully described in each figure legend, one of the following statistical tests was used: one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post hoc comparison of treatment groups to control (Fig. 1); Student's t test for comparison of only 2 groups (Fig. 1B); or two-way analysis of variance (factors: genotype, drug in Fig. 6) and if a significant interaction was evident, post hoc analysis by Neuman-Keuls comparison, *, p < 0.05; †, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001.FIGURE 6The contribution of ChREBP to the increase in hepatic lipogenesis following treatment with an LXR agonist.

These same lipogenic genes are known to be directly regulated by ChREBP (19Ishii S. Iizuka K. Miller B.C. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15597-15602Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), so we tested the hypothesis that ChREBP could be a target gene of the RXR/LXR heterodimer. Mice were fed diets containing synthetic agonists specific to various nuclear hormone receptors for 12 h (Fig. 1A). The efficacy and specificity of these agonists at doses used in these studies have been previously established (20Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.-M.A. Medina J. Li L. Lustig K. Shan B. Heyman R.A. Dietschy J.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Hepatic RNA levels of ChREBP were increased only in mice receiving the RXR ligand (3.7-fold), the LXR ligand (3.3-fold), or a combination of RXR and LXR agonists (6.3-fold). In an independent experiment, it was also observed that the PPARδ-specific agonist GW0742 administered to mice at 5 mpk for 14 h had no effect on hepatic ChREBP RNA levels (data not shown). These RNA measurements were performed using livers from mice that were provided dietary LXR agonist and analyzed in the post-prandial state in which serum glucose and/or insulin would be expected to be elevated. However, similar increases in hepatic ChREBP RNA expression have been observed in mice given a single equivalent dose of LXR drug by oral gavage and fasted for 14 h (data not shown). To further substantiate the role of LXR in the agonist-mediated induction of ChREBP, experiments were performed in mice lacking both LXRα and LXRβ (Fig. 1B). The Lxrα/β-double knock-out (LXR-DKO) and matched wild-type mice received synthetic agonists for RXR or LXR overnight (12 h, left panel) or for 10 days (right panel). Increased hepatic ChREBP mRNA levels were not observed in LXR-DKO mice receiving the LXR ligand, demonstrating the receptor-dependent nature of this gene regulation. The basal diet used in these studies (Fig. 1B) contained additional cholesterol to a level of 0.2% (w/w). Therefore, a modest LXR-mediated induction of ChREBP in vehicle-treated wild-type mice by the dietary cholesterol may account for the less pronounced induction by T0901317 seen in these experiments (2-2.4-fold) compared with the study shown in Fig. 1A, and the significant reduction in ChREBP mRNA levels seen in vehicle-treated LXR-DKO mice. The RXR agonist continued to elicit a significant, although reduced, induction of hepatic ChREBP in the LXR-DKO mice, suggesting that an additional RXR-mediated pathway may exist to regulate expression of ChREBP. Several distinct ChREBP transcripts have been identified in mouse tissues by Northern analysis (15Iizuka K. Bruick R.K. Liang G. Horton J.D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7281-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 21de Luis O. Valero M.C. Jurado L.A.P. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further evaluation of liver samples from mice treated with LXR and RXR agonists by Northern analysis revealed that all four ChREBP mRNA species (2.0, 3.9, 5.4, and 7.3 kb) show similar changes in steady-state levels (Fig. 1C). These results confirm those obtained by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Although the exact character of the multiple ChREBP mRNA species is currently unknown, these data strongly suggest that the RXR/LXR heterodimer transcriptionally regulates the expression of all mouse ChREBP mRNA species. Identification and Characterization of the Mouse ChREBP Gene Promoter—The transcriptional start site for the mouse ChREBP gene was determined using RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and revealed that the annotated nucleotide sequence described in the NCBI data base (NM_021455) indeed contains the full RNA sequence. Therefore, the transcriptional start site corresponds to nucleotide 451245 of the mouse genomic contig NT_080526.3 in the GenBank data base. A nearly 4-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse gene was cloned and ligated into a luciferase reporter plasmid (ChBP3801, Fig. 2) and transfected into HepG2 hepatoma cells along with expression vectors for LXRα and RXRα. The full-length native promoter exhibited increased transcriptional activity in cells exposed to the RXR ligand (1.8-fold), the LXR ligand (2-fold), and a combination of RXR and LXR agonists (3-fold). Similar results were obtained when LXRβ was provided instead of LXRα, or when the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 was used rather than HepG2 cells (data not shown). Merely providing the RXR and LXR receptors to cells resulted in enhanced basal expression of the native promoter (3-fold), a phenomenon previously observed for other LXR target genes (10Repa J.J.

Testing various truncation mutants of the ChREBP promoter suggested that the majority of LXR-mediated transcription required elements contained in the sequence flanked by nucleotides -2761 and -2167 (ChBP600, Fig. 2, A and C). Analysis of this sequence, when placed before a minimal thymidine kinase promoter in a luciferase-reporter plasmid, confirmed that ligand addition to receptor-transfected cells resulted in a 9-fold increase in activity (Fig. 2C, ChBP600), entirely due to sequences contained within the central 250 bp of this promoter fragment (Fig. 2C, box B). In silico analysis of this promoter fragment using algorithms specific for the identification of nuclear hormone receptor binding sites (23Podvinec M. Kaufmann M.R. Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Mol.

We show here that meiotic entry in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled by antisense-mediated regulation of IME4, a gene required for initiating meiosis. In MAT a/alpha diploids the antisense IME4 transcript is repressed by binding of the a1/alpha2 heterodimer at a conserved site located downstream of the IME4 coding sequence. MAT a/alpha diploids that produce IME4 antisense transcript have diminished sense transcription and fail to initiate meiosis. Haploids that produce the sense transcript have diminished antisense transcription and manifest several diploid phenotypes. Our data are consistent with transcription interference as a regulatory mechanism at the IME4 locus that determines cell fate."

Paradoxically, telomere function depends on checkpoint proteins such as ATM and ATR, but a molecular model explaining this seemingly contradictory relationship has been missing so far. Here we show that the DNA damage machinery acts on telomeres in at least two independent steps. First, the ATR-dependent machinery is recruited to telomeres before telomere replication is completed, likely in response to single-stranded DNA resulting from replication fork stalling. Second, after replication, telomeres attract ATM and the homologous recombination (HR) machinery. In vivo and in vitro results suggest that the HR machinery is required for formation of a telomere-specific structure at chromosome ends after replication. Our results suggest that telomere ends need to be recognized as DNA damage to complete end replication and to acquire a structure that is essential for function."

DsbB is an E. coli membrane protein that oxidizes DsbA, a periplasmic dithiol oxidase. To gain insight into disulfide bond formation, we determined the crystal structure of the DsbB-DsbA complex at 3.7 A resolution. The structure of DsbB revealed four transmembrane helices and one short horizontal helix juxtaposed with Cys130 in the mobile periplasmic loop. Whereas DsbB in the resting state contains a Cys104-Cys130 disulfide, Cys104 in the binary complex is engaged in the intermolecular disulfide bond and captured by the hydrophobic groove of DsbA, resulting in separation from Cys130. This cysteine relocation prevents the backward resolution of the complex and allows Cys130 to approach and activate the disulfide-generating reaction center composed of Cys41, Cys44, Arg48, and ubiquinone. We propose that DsbB is converted by its specific substrate, DsbA, to a superoxidizing enzyme, capable of oxidizing this extremely oxidizing oxidase."

Here, we identify the p53-associated factor E4F1, a ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger protein first identified as a cellular target of the viral oncoprotein E1A, as an atypical ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 that modulates its effector functions without promoting proteolysis. E4F1 stimulates oligo-ubiquitylation in the hinge region of p53 on lysine residues distinct from those targeted by Hdm2 and previously described to be acetylated by the acetyltransferase PCAF. E4F1 and PCAF mediate mutually exclusive posttranslational modifications of p53. E4F1-dependent Ub-p53 conjugates are associated with chromatin, and their stimulation coincides with the induction of a p53-dependent transcriptional program specifically involved in cell cycle arrest, and not apoptosis. Collectively, our data reveal that E4F1 is a key posttranslational regulator of p53, which modulates its effector functions involved in alternative cell fates: growth arrest or apoptosis."

To examine whether development impacts SCA1, we used a conditional transgenic mouse model of SCA1 to delay the postnatal expression of mutant ATXN1 until after completion of cerebellar development. Delayed postnatal expression of mutant ATXN1 led to a substantial reduction in severity of disease in adults in comparison with early postnatal gene expression. This was linked to a destabilization of RORα, a transcription factor critical for cerebellar development. In SCA1 mice, there was a depletion of RORα and a reduction in expression of genes controlled by RORα. Partial loss of RORα enhanced mutant ATXN1 pathogenicity.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of nine inherited diseases known as polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorders (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T.

Toxic protein in neurodegenerative disease.Science. 2002; 296: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The mutational mechanism of these diseases is the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine stretch within each respective disease-causing protein. Typical of the autosomal dominant ataxias, SCA1 is characterized by a progressive loss of motor coordination, speech impairment, and problems with swallowing. Although the SCA1 encoded protein ATAXIN 1 (ATXN1) is widely expressed (Servadio et al., 1995Servadio A. Koshy B. Armstrong D. Antalffy B. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y.

Sca1 null mice fail to develop ataxia and Purkinje cell pathology (Matilla et al., 1998Matilla A. Roberson E.D. Banfi S. Morales J. Armstrong D.L. Burright E.N. Orr H.T. Sweatt J.D. Zoghbi H.Y.

In contrast, mice that either overexpress mutant ATXN1 or mice that have a targeted insertion of 154 repeats into the endogenous Sca1 locus develop ataxia and Purkinje cell pathology similar to that seen in SCA1 patients (Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N.

Yet, even with these advances, the molecular mechanism by which a mutant ATXN1-induced alteration in gene expression results in the degeneration of only certain neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells, remains unknown. Here we show that developmental timing of mutant SCA1 expression has a substantial impact upon disease and suggest a mechanism by which mutant ATXN1 compromises cerebellar development and, thus, contributes to severity of neurodegeneration in adult mice. In the original series of SCA1[82Q] transgenic mice, one line, designated B04, stood out as having a relatively low level of SCA1 expression yet developed a severe ataxia (Figure S1; Burright et al., 1995Burright E.N. Clark H.B. Servadio A. Matilla T. Feddersen R.M. Yunis W.S. Duvick L.A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat.Cell. 1995; 82: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of SCA1 expression in line B04 is that it began on postnatal day 2. In the other SCA1[82Q] lines, exemplified by line B05, transgene expression begins during postnatal week 2 (days P10–P14). Since the first 3 postnatal weeks are a critical period for Purkinje cell and cerebellar cortex development in the mouse (Goldowitz and Hamre, 1998Goldowitz D. Hamre K. The cells and molecules that make a cerebellum.Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the increased susceptibility to mutant ATXN1 in SCA1[82Q] B04 mice might be due to expression of the SCA1[82Q] transgene for a greater portion of the critical period of postnatal development. The availability of a doxycycline-regulated conditional transgenic mouse model of SCA1 (Zu et al., 2004Zu T. Duvick L.A. Kaytor M.D. Berlinger M. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Recovery from polyglutamine-Induced neurodegeneration in conditional SCA1 transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8853-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) allowed us to test this idea. The strategy utilized was to compare disease in two groups of conditional SCA1[82Q] transgenic mice. Both groups were exposed to mutant ATXN1 expression for a total of 12 weeks. In one group, the 12 week gene-on group, SCA1 transgene expression was allowed to begin during postnatal week 2. In the second group SCA1 transgene expression was delayed for 14 weeks, until well after the cerebellum had matured, and then turned on for 12 weeks. The time course of SCA1 transgene expression in each group of mice was confirmed by northern blot analysis (Figure 1A). In the 12 week gene-on mice, SCA1 mRNA was first detectable at day P3, reaching the maximum level of expression by day P10. In the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on mice, expression of the SCA1 transgene was suppressed for 14 weeks. By 2 days after removing doxycycline, the SCA1 transgene reached a maximum level of expression similar to the maximum level of expression seen with the 12 week-gene-on mice. Disease severity in the 12 week gene-on mice and the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on mice was assessed using both neurological and pathological criteria. By home cage behavior, the 12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice had a moderate level of ataxia as reported previously (Zu et al., 2004Zu T. Duvick L.A. Kaytor M.D. Berlinger M. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Recovery from polyglutamine-Induced neurodegeneration in conditional SCA1 transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8853-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice showed no signs of ataxia. Consistent with the home cage behavior observations, the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on mice performed markedly better on the accelerating Rotarod than did the 12 week gene-on mice (Figure 1B). Purkinje cell pathology in both the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice and the 12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice was quantified by measuring the thickness of the molecular layer (Zu et al., 2004Zu T. Duvick L.A. Kaytor M.D. Berlinger M. Zoghbi H.Y. Clark H.B. Orr H.T. Recovery from polyglutamine-Induced neurodegeneration in conditional SCA1 transgenic mice.J.

The milder neurological phenotype seen in 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice was accompanied by a substantially reduced level of Purkinje cell pathology (Figures 1C and 1D). The thickness of the cerebellar molecular layer measured in the 14 week gene-off/12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice was greater, comparable to wild-type mice, than the thickness of the molecular layer seen in the 12 week gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice (Figure 1D). This milder Purkinje cell pathology continued to be observed when the 14 week gene-off/gene-on SCA1[82Q] mice were allowed to age further with the gene-on period extended to 24 weeks (Figure 1E). In 14 week gene-off/24 week gene-on mice, the thickness of the molecular layer remained greater than the molecular layer in mice where SCA1[82Q] was expressed for 24 weeks straight. To further focus on the critical period where the lack of mutant ATXN1 expression seems to protect Purkinje cells from the effects of subsequent expression of mutant ATXN1, we generated mice where SCA1[82Q] was expressed for 12 weeks following off periods of either the first 2 or 3 postnatal weeks. At both the primary fissure and a posterior fissure, gene-off periods for the first 2 and 3 postnatal weeks also had a protective effect on the thickness of the molecular layer (Figure 1D). These data indicate that the timing of mutant ATXN1 expressed during the first postnatal weeks, i.e., during a critical period of cerebellar development and maturation, modifies subsequent disease severity in the adult. One potential explanation for this developmental effect on SCA1 severity is that ATXN1 interacts with a pathway involved in Purkinje cell development. Previously, using a subtractive cDNA approach (Lin et al., 2000Lin X. Antalffy B. Kang D. Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Polyglutamine expansion down-regulates specific neuronal genes before pathologic changes in SCA1.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) as well as a microarray-based gene profiling strategy (Serra et al., 2004Serra H.G. Byam C.E. Lande J.D. Tousey S.K. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Gene profiling links SCA1 pathophysiology to glutamate signaling in Purkinje cells of transgenic mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 2535-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we identified four genes whose expression is regulated by RORα (Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A. Baek S.H. Schork N.J. Rose D.W.

Subsequently, we analyzed the SCA1 gene-profile data set with a set of analytical programs specifically designed for microarray data. This analysis yielded an expanded SCA1-selected set of 53 genes, 13 of which increased in expression with disease and 40 of which decreased in expression with disease (Table S1). When the set of 40 genes with a decreased expression in 5 week-old SCA1[82Q] mice was compared to the entire set of RORα-mediated genes generated by Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A. Baek S.H. Schork N.J.

Among the RORα-responsive genes in the SCA1 gene set were all four of the genes to which RORα has been found to bind directly to their promoters in vivo (Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A. Baek S.H.

These data indicated that RORα-mediated genes are, as a group, downregulated at an early stage of disease in Purkinje cells of SCA1[82Q] mice.Table 1Overlap between SCA1[82Q] and Staggerer (RORα) Gene SetsGENEPROTEINStaggererSCA1[82Q]MicroarrayQ-PCRMicroarrayQ-PCRCalb1calbindin-28K, Ca+2 binding protein⇓⇓∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).Itpr1∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1⇓⇓⇓∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).Slc1a6∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).EAAT4, glutamate transporter⇓⇓⇓∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).Pcp2 (L7)∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).GoLoco G protein modulatory domain⇓⇓⇓RoraRAR-related orphan Receptor α⇓⇓Kit1kit ligand⇓⇓∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).Pcp4∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003).calmodulin inhibitor⇓⇓⇓Spnb3brain-specific β-spectrin III⇓⇓Idb2inhibitor of DNA binding 2⇓⇓Grm1mGluR1 glutamate receptor subunit⇓⇓Atp2a2SERCA2, Ca+2-transporting ATPase⇓⇓Cals1CARP, an Itpr1 binding protein⇓⇓⇓Homer2⇔⇔∗∗ ∗∗Genes to which RORα binds to the promoter (Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether a decrease in RORα might be the cause of the decrease in RORα-mediated gene expression seen in cerebella from the SCA1 mice, we used immunofluorescence to assess RORα expression. Figure 2A shows the level of RORα immunostaining in the nuclei of wild-type mouse Purkinje cells as well as the level of staining in the nuclei of specific interneurons in the molecular layer. In contrast, the levels of RORα staining in Purkinje cell nuclei in a 12 week-old SCA1[82Q] heterozygous mouse (Figure 2B) was noticeably less than RORα staining in the nuclei of wild-type Purkinje cells. Sca1−/− mice (Figure 2C) and mice overexpressing a wild-type allele of SCA1 (Figure 2D) had levels of RORα in their Purkinje cells that appeared similar to those seen in wild-type mice. To quantitatively assess the levels of RORα, we determined the mean pixel density of RORα-positive Purkinje cell and interneuron nuclei (Figure 2E). This analysis showed that there were significant decreases in the levels of RORα in the Purkinje cell nuclei of SCA1[30Q] and SCA1[82Q] compared to wild-type mice. To obtain a more quantitative assessment of RORα levels, we performed western blot analyses. As a specificity control, the amount of RORα in a cerebellar lysate prepared from a staggerer (sg/sg) mouse, a null mutation at Rora (Hamilton et al., 1996Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. Fitz-Hugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B. et al.Disruption of the nuclear hormone receptor RORα in staggerer mice.Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), was determined and found to be negligible compared to the level of RORα in cerebellar lysate from a wild-type mouse (Figure 3A, lane 1 versus lane 8). Compared to the level of RORα in a lysate from a wild-type mouse, the amount of RORα in a lysate from a 12 week-old mouse expressing a conditional SCA1[82Q] allele was decreased significantly (Figure 3A, lane 4). Importantly, when the conditional SCA1[82Q] allele was turned off, RORα levels returned to normal by 2 days (Figure 3A, lane 5). To confirm that the restoration of RORα expression occurred within Purkinje cell nuclei, we used immunofluorescence to examine RORα expression within 5 days of shutting off SCA1 expression in the conditional SCA1[82Q] transgenic mice (Figures 3B and 3C). Mice lacking expression of the endogenous Sca1 gene, Sca1−/− mice, had levels of RORα by western blot analysis similar to those seen in wild-type mice (Figure 3A, lane 3). Normal levels of RORα were also found in mice expressing a form of ATXN1 with 82 glutamines, ATXN1[82Q]-K772T (Figure 3A, lane 2), that does not cause disease due to a mutation in the nuclear localization sequence preventing the protein from entering the nucleus (Klement et al., 1998Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. ATAXIN 1 nuclear localization and aggregation: role in polyglutamine-induced disease in SCA1 transgenic mice.Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice overexpressing wild-type ATXN1, ATXN1[30Q], also had levels of RORα similar to nontransgenic wild-type mice (Figure 3A, lane 7). Thus, decreased levels of RORα were found only in cerebellar extracts from mice expressing a mutant form of ATXN1 that caused ataxia. To gain insight into the molecular basis for the loss of RORα from Purkinje cell nuclei in the presence of mutant ATXN1, northern blots were performed. As shown in Figure 3D, the amount of RORα mRNA in a SCA1[82Q] cerebellum was decreased compared to wild-type, SCA1[30Q], or Sca1−/− mice. Thus, in the presence of mutant ATXN1, both RORα protein and mRNA levels were reduced. The conditional SCA1[82Q] mice were used to assess the relative contributions of RNA-based and protein-based mechanisms to the mutant ATXN1-induced decrease in RORα. The cerebellar levels of RORα protein and mRNA in 12 week gene-on mice were compared with those from 12 week gene-on/2 day gene-off mice. The results (Figure 3E) show that after turning the SCA1[82Q] gene off for 2 days the RORα protein was restored in absence of a restoration of the RORα-mRNA level. This result is consistent with mutant ATXN1 affecting RORα protein levels independent of its effect on RORα-mRNA levels. To evaluate the role of RORα in SCA1 pathogenesis in vivo using a genetic approach, we assessed the effect of a loss-of-function allele of Rora in Purkinje cells by placing the SCA1[82Q] transgene on a sg/+ background that lacks one functional copy of Rora. It is important to note that this approach is complicated by the fact that the Pcp2 promoter directing Purkinje cell expression of the SCA1[82Q] transgene is regulated by RORα (Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A. Baek S.H. Schork N.J. Rose D.W. Larsen D.D. Sachs B.D. Rosenfeld M.G. Hamilton B.A. RORα coordinates reciprocal signaling in cerebellar development through Sonic hedgehog and calcium-dependent pathways.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1119-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The prediction would be that loss of function at Rora would result in a decrease in ATXN1[82Q] expression, which by itself would lead to a less severe form of disease. Therefore, mice homozygous for Pcp2-SCA1[82Q] were crossed onto the sg/+ background. As predicted, mice homozygous for Pcp2-SCA1[82Q] and heterozygous for sg expressed a reduced level of SCA1[82Q] compared to homozygous Pcp2-SCA1[82Q] mice on a wild-type background (Figure 4A). The amount of SCA1[82Q] expressed by the homozygous SCA1[82Q]:sg/+ mice was comparable to SCA1[82Q] expressed by heterozygous SCA1[82Q] mice on a wild-type background. Thus, to assess the effect of a partial loss of RORα function on SCA1, the disease status in heterozygous SCA1[82Q] mice on a wild-type background was compared to the level of disease in the homozygous SCA1[82Q]:sg/+ mice. Figure 4B shows that Purkinje cell pathology in the homozygous SCA1[82Q]:sg/+ mice at 20 and 24 weeks of age was more severe than the pathology seen in heterozygous SCA1[82Q] mice. These results indicate that there is a genetic interaction between SCA1[82Q] and Rora and support the idea that loss of Rora function enhances ATXN1[82Q] pathogenicity. To gain insight into the molecular means by which mutant ATXN1 disrupts RORα-mediated gene expression in Purkinje cells, we examined the possibility that ATXN1 interacts with RORα. First, ATXN1[30Q] and RORα proteins colocalized within the nuclei of Purkinje cells by confocal microscopy (Figure S2). To examine whether this reflected a biochemical interaction between endogenous ATXN1 and RORα, we performed coimmunoprecipitation studies on cerebellar lysates prepared from normal and Sca1−/− mice. An immunoprecipitation using an antibody against RORα coimmunoprecipitated ATXN1 from a lysate prepared from a normal mouse cerebellum. Conversely, RORα coimmunoprecipitated with the anti-ATXN1 antibody 11750 (Figure 5A). Control immunoprecipitations using lysates prepared from the cerebella of Sca1−/− mice failed to bring down ATXN1 with the anti-RORα antibody or RORα with the anti-ATXN1 antibody. GST-ATXN1 pull-downs of in vitro transcribed/translated RORα were used to assess whether ATXN1 and RORα might interact directly. As show in Figure 5B, the results of this analysis failed to demonstrate an interaction. None of the following were able to able to pull down RORα above background levels observed with GST alone: GST-Atx-30Q, 53Q, and 82Q. The ability to coimmunoprecipitate ATXN1 and RORα from cerebellar extracts in the absence of a direct interaction between the two proteins indicates that ATXN 1 interacts directly with a component of the RORα complex other than RORα itself. At the promoter of Purkinje cell-specific genes, RORα exists in a complex that includes many coregulators (Gold et al., 2003Gold D.A. Baek S.H. Schork N.J. Rose D.W. Larsen D.D. Sachs B.D.

Hamilton B.A. RORα coordinates reciprocal signaling in cerebellar development through Sonic hedgehog and calcium-dependent pathways.Neuron. 2003; 40: 1119-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One protein found consistently in the RORα complex at Purkinje cell-specific genes is the coactivator Tip60 (Brady et al., 1999Brady M.E. Ozanne D.M. Gaughan L. Waite I. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. Tip60 is a nuclear hormone receptor coactivator.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17599-17604Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we tested whether ATXN1 interacts with Tip60. Coimmunoprecipitations using cerebella extracts from wild-type mice indicated that endogenous ATXN1 and Tip60 do interact (Figure 5C). The ability of GST-ATXN1 to pull down Tip60 from wild-type mouse cerebella extracts provided additional evidence that ATXN1 and Tip60 interact (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the GST-ATXN1 pull down results suggested that as the length of the polyglutamine tract increased from 30Q to 53Q to 82Q the amount of Tip60 pulled down increased. The effect of the ATXN1 polyglutamine tract length on its interaction with Tip60 was also assessed using coimmunoprecipitations from transfected tissue culture cell extracts. Figure 5E shows that more ATXN1[82Q] was coimmunoprecipitated with Tip60 than was ATXN1[30Q], providing further evidence for a polyglutamine effect on the interaction of ATXN1 with Tip60. To assess if ATXN1 and Tip60 might interact directly, we utilized GST-ATXN1 pull-downs of in vitro transcribed/translated Tip60. In contrast to the results obtained when this approach was used to assess the interaction of ATXN1 with RORα, Figure 5F shows that GST-ATXN1 was able to pull down in vitro transcribed/translated Tip60. However, this analysis failed to provide evidence of a polyglutamine tract effect. When the amount of GST-ATXN1 was taken into account, GST-ATXN1-30Q, -53Q, and -82Q appeared to interact withTip60 equally. In light of the evidence that ATXN1 interacts directly with Tip60, the regions of ATXN1 responsible for this interaction were mapped. We generated a series of constructs encoding FLAG-tagged fragments that spanned the length of wild-type ATXN1 (Figure 6A). These constructs were cotransfected with Tip60 into COS cells. As shown in Figure 6B, the results reveal that amino acids 425–547 of ATXN1 have a critical role in ATXN1's interac"

Here we demonstrate that the extremely conserved LepA protein, present in all bacteria and mitochondria, is a third elongation factor required for accurate and efficient protein synthesis. LepA has the unique function of back-translocating posttranslocational ribosomes, and the results suggest that it recognizes ribosomes after a defective translocation reaction and induces a back-translocation, thus giving EF-G a second chance to translocate the tRNAs correctly. We suggest renaming LepA as elongation factor 4 (EF4)."

The mitotic activator Cdc25 is suppressed by checkpoints through inhibitory phosphorylation at Ser287 (Xenopus numbering) and docking of 14-3-3. Ser287 phosphorylation is a major locus of G2/M checkpoint control, although several checkpoint-independent kinases can phosphorylate this site. We reported previously that mitotic entry requires 14-3-3 removal and Ser287 dephosphorylation. We show here that DNA-responsive checkpoints also activate PP2A/B56δ phosphatase complexes to dephosphorylate Cdc25 at a site distinct from Ser287 (T138), the phosphorylation of which is required for 14-3-3 release. However, phosphorylation of T138 is not sufficient for 14-3-3 release from Cdc25. Our data suggest that creation of a 14-3-3 “sink,” consisting of phosphorylated 14-3-3 binding intermediate filament proteins, including keratins, coupled with reduced Cdc25-14-3-3 affinity, contribute to Cdc25 activation. These observations identify PP2A/B56δ as a central checkpoint effector and suggest a mechanism for controlling 14-3-3 interactions to promote mitosis."

In Drosophila, proteolytic processing of Delta by ADAM10-like (Kuzbanian-like) alleviates the inhibitory effect of Delta on Notch in the same cell (23Sapir A. Assa-Kunik E. Tsruya R. Schejter E. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2005; 132: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, processing of Jagged 1 in mammalian cells by ADAM17 was postulated to inhibit Notch signaling in cis due to competition of the C-terminal fragments of Jagged 1 and Notch for γ-secretase (14LaVoie M.J. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34427-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In this work we have tested the ability of several ADAMs other than ADAM10 to cleave murine Dll1 and examined the effect of Dll1 cleavage on Notch signaling in the same cell. We show that ADAM12, which has not been previously implicated in Notch signaling, can efficiently process Dll1 but not Notch1. We demonstrate that Dll1 cleavage by ADAM12 activates Notch in a cell-autonomous manner. In addition, we show that two other ADAMs, ADAM9 and 17, are capable of Dll1 processing, and we identify a residue within the ADAM catalytic motif that appears necessary for the cleavage of Dll1. The extent of processing of Dll1 transfected into ADAM9/12/15-/- MEFs is reduced when compared with the processing in wild type MEFs, suggesting that the endogenous ADAM9 and/or ADAM12 present in wild type MEFs contribute to Dll1 cleavage. Finally, we show that the endogenous Dll1 present in primary mouse myoblasts undergoes cleavage in confluent, differentiating myoblast cultures, and this cleavage is decreased by ADAM12 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Expression Constructs—Mouse Dll1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using a full-length clone (ID 6402691; Invitrogen) as a template and cloned into pIRESpuro expression vector. c-Myc-Dll1 containing an internal c-Myc tag between amino acids 46 and 47, inserted into the SacII site in Dll1 cDNA, was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector. Mouse full-length cDNAs of ADAM9, -12, -15, and -17 were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector; these ADAMs contained c-Myc and His6 tags at their termini. An untagged ADAM12 was generated by introducing a stop codon after the C-terminal Lys residue. The E349Q and N353S ADAM12 mutants and the S354N ADAM15 mutant were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Mouse Notch1 containing an intact extracellular domain and in which 348 C-terminal amino acids were replaced with 6 copies of c-Myc tag (pCS2+mN1FL6MT) was provided by R. Kopan (Washington University). CBF1 reporters containing four wild type or mutated CBF1 binding sites (pJH23A and pJH25A, respectively) were provided by D. Hayward (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine); Notch reporter containing eight CBF1 binding sites (pJT123A) was provided by P. D. Ling (Baylor College of Medicine). Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfection—COS-7, NIH3T3, and CHO-K1 cells (American Tissue Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; COS-7 and NIH3T3) or F12K nutrient mixture (CHO-K1), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 under a humidified atmosphere. Primary myoblasts were isolated from 2-3-day-old C57BL/6 mice according to Rando and Blau (24Rando T.A. Blau H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) and grown on collagen I-coated plates in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. MEFs isolated from ADAM9/12/15-/- (16Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) or from wild type mice and immortalized with simian virus 40 large T antigen were grown on gelatin-coated dishes in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 100 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. One day after plating, cells were transfected using Fugene6 (Roche Applied Science). In most experiments the amount of total DNA was 1 μg/well in a 6-well plate; for CBF1 reporter assays, 2.05 μg of DNA/well was used (see below). For stable expression of c-Myc-Dll1 in CHO-K1 cells, transfected cells were grown for 2 weeks in the presence of Geneticin (800 μg/ml); a clone positive for c-Myc-Dll1 expression was isolated. Cells with the highest expression of cell-surface c-Myc were further selected by cell sorting using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). RNA Interference—Three different Silencer siRNA duplexes specific for mouse ADAM12 and a negative control siRNA (control #1) were purchased from Ambion. The sequences of sense RNA strands were: CCAGAGAGGAGCUUACGAAtt (siRNA1); GCCAAUGAAAAACACCACUtt (siRNA2); GCAAAUUACCACAUUGUCUtt (siRNA3). Mouse primary myoblasts were trypsinized and transfected with individual siRNA duplexes (30 nm) using siPORT NeoFX transfection reagent (Ambion) as cells attached to plates. One day after transfection, confluent cells were transferred to differentiation medium (DMEM with 2% horse serum). The level of expression of ADAM12 and the amount of Dll1 cleavage were analyzed 40 h later. Cell Treatments—In some experiments, before harvesting, cells were incubated for 3 h with 5 μm lactacystin (a proteasomal inhibitor), for 6 h with 1 μm L685,458 (a γ-secretase inhibitor), for 1 h with 1 μm ionomycin, or for 1 h with 25 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Cells were serum-starved for 30 min before and during the PMA treatment. Western Blotting—Cellular proteins were extracted with extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene-sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline; 0.5 ml extraction buffer/well in a 6-well plate). Cell extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% (w/v) dry milk and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 in DPBS, then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and detection using the WestPico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). To detect the endogenous ADAM12 in primary myoblasts, cell extracts were enriched for glycoproteins using concanavalin A-agarose beads (20-μl bed volume/ml cell extract) before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (25Cao Y. Kang Q. Zhao Z. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26403-26411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-ADAM12 cytoplasmic peptide antibody (1:3000), rabbit anti-ADAM12 disintegrin antibody (1:3000), rabbit anti-Dll1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-265; 0.2 μg/ml), mouse anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10, Upstate Biotechnology; 1 μg/ml). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain-specific) or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Fc fragment-specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch; 0.8μg/ml; used in the experiment shown in Fig. 4C). Intensities of the bands in Western blots were determined by densitometry and quantified using ScionImage software. Each experiment involving quantitative determination of Dll1 cleavage was repeated at least three times. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—To immunoprecipitate the N-terminal fragment of Dll1 from culture media, 24 h after co-transfection with c-Myc-Dll1 and ADAM12, COS-7 cells were transferred to DMEM:methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (1:9) containing 35S-labeled EasyTag Express protein labeling mix (267 μCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After 16 h medium was collected, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 9E10 antibody (5 μg/ml). To immunoprecipitate c-Myc-tagged ADAMs or untagged ADAM12, 36 h after transfection cells were lysed with extraction buffer, cell extracts were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with 9E10 antibody (5 μg/ml) or with anti-ADAM12 cytoplasmic peptide antibody (1:250), respectively. To immunoprecipitate Dll1 from transfected MEFs or the endogenous Dll1 from primary myoblasts, anti-Dll1 antibody (H-265, 5 μg/ml) was used. After preclearing, supernatants were incubated with antibodies and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), the beads were washed three times with extraction buffer, and immunocomplexes were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography or Western blotting. CBF1 Reporter Assay—NIH3T3 cells in 6-well plates were transfected at 50% confluence with 0.5 μg of Notch1, 0.5 μg of CBF1 firefly luciferase reporter, 0.05 μg of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK), 0.5 μg ADAM12 or empty pcDNA3.1 vector, and 0.5 μg of Dll1 or empty pIRES-puro vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with c-Myc-Dll1 or with empty vector were added (106 cells/well) and co-cultured for an additional 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. First, we asked whether ADAM12 is capable of processing Dll1. When untagged Dll1 was transfected into COS-7 cells, antibody specific for the C terminus of Dll1 detected the full-length protein of ∼90 kDa and a low level of the C-terminal Dll1 fragment (CTF) of ∼29 kDa in cell lysates (Fig. 1A). Co-transfection of wild type mouse ADAM12, but not the catalytically inactive E349Q mutant, strongly increased the abundance of CTF (Fig. 1A), suggesting that ADAM12 cleaved Dll1. To follow the fate of the N-terminal portion of Dll1, we introduced c-Myc tag between amino acids 46 and 47 of Dll1 (Fig. 1B). After metabolic labeling of transfected cells with [35S]methionine+cysteine, we immunoprecipitated the ∼60-kDa soluble N-terminal fragment (NTF) of Dll1 from culture medium (Fig. 1B, middle panel). The amount of detected NTF was much higher when cells were co-transfected with wild type ADAM12, indicating that Dll1 cleavage took place in intact cells and that NTF was released to medium. ADAM12-catalyzed processing of Dll1 (as well as the processing mediated by endogenous ADAMs present in COS-7 cells) was more efficient at high cell density (∼90% confluence at the time of assaying) than at low cell density (∼50% confluence; Fig. 2A). This result suggested that the cleavage might have taken place in trans orientation. However, co-transfection of ADAM12 and Dll1 yielded significantly more CTF than co-culture of cells that were singly transfected with Dll1 or with ADAM12 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the cleavage occurred in cis. Thus, cell density dependence of Dll1 cleavage suggests that interactions of Dll1 or ADAM12 with proteins present on the surface of neighboring cells may be required for the efficient processing of Dll1. It was reported that removal of the extracellular domain of Dll1 was followed by cleavage of CTF by γ-secretase (12Ikeuchi T. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7751-7754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Six E. Ndiaye D. Laabi Y. Brou C. Gupta-Rossi N. Israël A. Logeat F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34427-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In our experiments the product of γ-secretase (ICD, the intracellular domain of Dll1, ∼3 kDa smaller than CTF) was poorly detectable in immunoblots, but it was augmented in cells treated with lactacystin, a proteasomal inhibitor (Fig. 3A). Incubation of cells with L685,458, a γ-secretase inhibitor, resulted in increased accumulation of CTF (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that at least part of ADAM12-generated CTF Dll1 is further processed by γ-secretase to produce ICD Dll1, and the ICD fragment is then subject to proteasomal degradation. ADAM10- or ADAM17-mediated cleavage of several substrate proteins is increased by ionomycin or phorbol esters, respectively (16Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here, ADAM12-mediated processing of Dll1 was not increased by ionomycin and was only weakly stimulated by PMA (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that ADAM12 is capable of constitutive rather than stimulated cleavage of Dll1. To test whether ADAM12 can also cleave Notch, a receptor for Dll1, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with ADAM12 and Notch1 and cultured cells at high density. As a positive control, we used ADAM17, which acts as α-secretase for Notch and, upon ligand binding, cleaves Notch at the S2 site (4Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israël A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). After stimulation of cells with PMA, the S2 cleavage product NEXT, was clearly detected in ADAM17-cotransfected cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the S2 product was not detected in ADAM12-transfected cells, suggesting that ADAM12 lacks α-secretase activity toward Notch1. ADAM12-mediated Dll1 processing did not require an intact cytoplasmic tail of ADAM12, as the full-length ADAM12 and the XT fragment containing a 169-amino acid deletion at the C terminus (29Yi H. Gruszczynska-Biegala J. Wood D. Zhao Z. Zolkiewska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23475-23483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) processed Dll1 equally well (Fig. 4A). Dll1 and ADAM12 co-immunoprecipitated together by an antibody specific to the C terminus of ADAM12 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the immunocomplexes contained the full-length Dll1 but not the 29-kDa CTF (Fig. 4C). The N-terminal extracellular fragment of Dll1 generated after ADAM12 cleavage was, however, also excluded from the ADAM12-Dll1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 4D), suggesting that only the full-lengthDll1 was capable of interacting with ADAM12. The lack of 60-kDa NTF Dll1 in ADAM12 immunoprecipitates is consistent with the result shown in Fig. 1B, in which the N-terminal fragment of Dll1 was released to medium and was not found in association with cells. Having established that Dll1, a Notch ligand but not Notch itself, is cleaved by ADAM12, we examined the effect of Dll1 cleavage on Notch signaling. To monitor the activation status of the Notch pathway, we utilized CBF1-luc reporters containing four (30Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) or eight binding sites (31Peng R. Gordadze A.V. Fuentes Panana E.M. Wang F. Zong J. Hayward G.S. Tan J. Ling P.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) for CBF1, a CSL transcription factor activated by Notch (11Hayward S.D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2004; 14: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with mouse Notch1 and a Notch reporter and co-cultured with CHO cells stably transfected with Dll1 (CHO.Dll1) or with empty vector (CHO.Vec). Co-culture with CHO.Dll1 cells led to higher activity of the reporter than co-culture with CHO.Vec cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the exogenous Dll1 expressed in CHO.Dll1 cells activated Notch. The extent of this activation was more modest than reported previously in several other studies, in which quail QT6 or mouse L fibroblasts were employed to present Notch ligands to Notch-expressing cells (21Ladi E. Nichols J.T. Ge W. Miyamoto A. Yao C. Yang L.T. Boulter J. Sun Y.E. Kintner C. Weinmaster G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32Jarriault S. Le Bail O. Hirsinger E. Pourquié O. Logeat F. Strong S.F. Brou C. Seidah N.G. Israël A. . 1998; 18: 7423-7431Google Scholar). One of the reasons of a modest increase in Notch activity in our system may be that co-culture with control CHO.Vec cells had already stimulated Notch 4-5-fold when compared with the conditions without CHO.Vec cells (results are not shown). This was most likely due to high expression levels of the endogenous Notch ligands in CHO cells that were capable of Notch activation. In such case, further increase of the amount of ligand by transfecting exogenous Dll1 might have had a limited effect and, understandably, might not have produced additional strong increase in Notch activity. Nonetheless, increased activity of the Notch reporter induced by co-culture with CHO.Dll1 versus CHO.Vec cells was observed for the reporter containing intact, but not mutated, CBF1 binding sites (Fig. 5A), which validated our co-culture assay to measure Notch activation. When Dll1 was further co-expressed with Notch in NIH3T3 cells, the activation of Notch was abolished (Fig. 5B) due to formation of Notch/Dll1 complexes in cis (19Sakamoto K. Ohara O. Takagi M. Takeda S. Katsube K. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Katsube K. Sakamoto K. Int. J. Dev.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1448-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Most importantly, further co-transfection of Dll1-processing ADAM12 resulted in re-activation of the Notch reporter (Fig. 5B). The catalytically inactive mutant of ADAM12, E349Q, which did not process Dll1 (Fig. 1), did not activate Notch either (Fig. 5B). This result suggested that when Notch and Dll1 were expressed in the same cell, proteolytic processing of Dll1 increased the ability of Notch to receive signals and to activate its downstream signaling pathway. We next tested whether Dll1 can serve as a substrate for three other ADAMs that have not been previously implicated in Dll1 cleavage, ADAM9, -15, and -17. All these ADAMs as well as ADAM12 were engineered to contain a C-terminal c-Myc tag for a common detection with anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 6). Co-transfection with Dll1 demonstrated that ADAM9 and -17, similarly to ADAM12, had catalytic activity toward Dll1, but ADAM15 was not able to process Dll1 (Fig. 6A). After comparing the amounts of the 29-kDa fragment of Dll1 and the amounts of mature, catalytically active forms of each ADAM, we concluded that the cleavage of Dll1 occurred with the following potency order: ADAM17 > ADAM12 > ADAM9. Interestingly, all ADAM proteins used in this study formed stable complexes with Dll1, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 6B). Thus, ADAM15 interacted with Dll1 but was unable to cleave it. Importantly, ADAM15 contains a consensus sequence of the catalytic site of zinc-dependent metalloproteases and appears catalytically active (33Martin J. Eynstone L.V"

Egan G.T. Keusch G.T. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: iv-viiCrossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It also represents a stage during which many metabolic pathways, unique to the parasite, are switched on and as a result has been the focus of the majority of antimalarial drug development strategies (2Rosenthal P.J.

One essential pathway that has been a particular target for antimalarial drug discovery is the catabolism of erythrocyte hemoglobin; between 65 and 75% of the host cell hemoglobin is degraded in a process that results in the liberation of free amino acids (4McKerrow J.H.

A. 2006; 101: 8840-8845Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that hemoglobin digestion is necessary for parasite survival and that this process alone can supply the parasite with most of its amino acid requirements. The initial steps in the catabolism of host hemoglobin take place within the acidic digestive vacuole (DV) 5The abbreviations used are: DV, digestive vacuole; H-Leu-NHMec, l-leucine-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mFu, millifluorescent units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PfLAP, P. falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase; LAP, leucyl aminopeptidase; rPfLAP, recombinant PfLAP; Ni-NTA, nickelnitrilotriacetic acid; LCR, low complexity region. 5The abbreviations used are: DV, digestive vacuole; H-Leu-NHMec, l-leucine-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mFu, millifluorescent units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PfLAP, P. falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase; LAP, leucyl aminopeptidase; rPfLAP, recombinant PfLAP; Ni-NTA, nickelnitrilotriacetic acid; LCR, low complexity region. of the parasite and involve a number of endopeptidases of various mechanistic classes, including aspartic proteases (plasmepsins I, II, and IV), cysteine proteinases (falcipains 2, 2′, and 3), and a metalloprotease (falcilysin) (7Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Rosenthal P.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). An exopeptidase, dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase I, or cathepsin C, also exists in the DV and, as its name implies, can reduce peptides generated by endopeptidase activity to dipeptides (13Klemba M. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43000-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Studies using P. falciparum demonstrated that soluble lysates of DVs could degrade human hemoglobin to small peptide fragments but were incapable of liberating free amino acids (14Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, when human hemoglobin was incubated with cytosolic extracts, the main products generated were free amino acids suggesting the presence of an exopeptidase activity (mono-, di-, tri-, and carboxypeptidases) in this cellular compartment. These observations also imply that small peptide fragments derived from hemoglobin degradation are transported from the DV to the parasite cytosol for processing into free amino acids by these enzymes (14Kolakovich K.A. Gluzman I.Y. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J. Mullally M. O'Hara H. Troy A.

The activity was optimum at neutral pH, inactive below pH 6.0, and had a preference for synthetic substrates containing leucine and alanine at the N terminus (15Curley G.P. O'Donovan S.M. McNally J.

Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These biochemical properties are consistent with an enzymatic function outside the DV and a proposed role in the terminal stages of hemoglobin catabolism because leucine and alanine constitute ∼24% of the amino acids in this protein. Furthermore, a partially purified P. falciparum aminopeptidase was capable of freeing amino acids from synthetic peptides representative of the products of endopeptidase-degraded hemoglobin, and was inactivated by the specific aminopeptidase inhibitors bestatin and nitrobestatin (16Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These same inhibitors arrested the growth of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi and P. falciparum parasites in vitro, most particularly at the intra-erythrocytic trophozoite stages that express the highest aminopeptidase activity (16Gavigan C.S. Dalton J.P. Bell A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Nankya-Kitaka M.F. Curley G.P. Gavigan C.S. Bell A. Dalton J.P. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although a total of eight aminopeptidases have been identified among the annotated sequences of the 26-Mb P. falciparum genome (23Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherforf K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J. Suh B. Peterson J. Angiuoli S. Pertea M.

Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar), only two belong to families of neutral aminopeptidases as follows: a 67.8-kDa M17-family leucyl aminopeptidase (PF14_0439), and a 122-kDa M1-family alanyl aminopeptidase (MAL13P1.56). The M17 aminopeptidases are classically described as cytosolic enzymes, whereas the M1 aminopeptidases are typically membrane-bound; however, Florent and co-workers (22Florent I. Derhy Z. Allargy M. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Shrevel J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) detected M1 alanyl aminopeptidase activity in soluble extracts of P. falciparum and used antipeptide antibodies to identify 98- and 68-kDa immunoreactive processed forms of the parent 122-kDa membrane-bound aminopeptidase. In an attempt to identify whether the M17 or M1 aminopeptidase, or both, was the target of the bestatin-mediated killing of P. falciparum, we generated transgenic parasites that overexpressed these aminopeptidases (10Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Stack C.M. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1741-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Only the parasites overexpressing the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase gene produced a functional enzyme, whereas the M1 aminopeptidase transgenic parasites produced an inactive protein of 120 kDa that did not process to smaller fragments. The transgenic P. falciparum parasites overexpressing the M17 aminopeptidase were less susceptible to killing by bestatin when compared with wild-type parasites pinpointing this enzyme as a target for this antimalarial inhibitor (10Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Stack C.M. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1741-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study we have successfully produced a functionally active recombinant form of the malaria M17 leucyl aminopeptidase, rPfLAP, and report for the first time its physico-biochemical properties, cellular expression, and distribution. We interpret our findings in the light of previously published reports of aminopeptidase activities in extracts of malaria parasites. We also show that the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin, and other dipeptide analogs are potent inhibitors of rPfLAP and prevent the growth of P. falciparum parasites in vitro. Our data provide further support for designating the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase as a promising target for new antimalarials. Parasite Culture—The asexual intra-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum parasites were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum (24Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6122) Google Scholar). The parasites used were D10, a noncytoadherent clone of FC27 lacking the right end of chromosome 9 (25Anders R.F. Brown G.V. Edwards A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6652-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and were obtained from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia. The parasites were synchronized using two rounds of sorbitol treatment (26Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2813) Google Scholar), and stage-specific parasites were harvested at ring stage, early trophozoite stage, late trophozoite stage, and schizont stage. The P. falciparum M17 Leucyl Aminopeptidase Gene, Codon Optimization, and Gene Synthesis—The M17 leucyl aminopeptidase gene sequence (Pf14_0439), as annotated by PlasmoDB, is located on chromosome 14 of P. falciparum. It consists of a single exon of 1818 bp encoding a 605-amino acid protein. The gene was amplified from genomic DNA using primers described below but was also chemically synthesized by GENE-ART GmbH (GeneArt, Germany) using codons for optimized gene expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites were removed in gene synthesis by replacing the asparagine of all Asn-X-(Thr/Ser) motifs with Glu. These genes were ligated into pCR-Script cloning vector (Stratagene, CA). Plasmid Construction and Transfection into Parasites—For the transgenic expression of PF14_0439-GFP under the control of the hsp86 promoter, the complete M17 aminopeptidase gene PF14_0439 was amplified from D10 DNA using primers M17F (AGATCTATGTATTTTTCTTCCTTATGT), which contained a BglII restriction site (in boldface), and M17R (CTG-CAGTAGAGCGTCATTGAGTACAAA), which contained a PstI site (in boldface), but not the putative stop codon of the gene. The gene was cloned into pHGB Gateway Entry vector containing the hsp86 promoter region and modified to contain BglII/PstI sites between the promoter and the GFP (gift from Dr. Chris Tonkin). This entry vector containing the PF14_0439-GFP sequence was used in a Clonase™ reaction (Invitrogen) with a pHHC*/DR0.28 vector containing a destination cassette to obtain vectors mediating expression of PF14_0439-GFP fusion proteins under the hsp86 promoter. Inserts of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Ring stage parasites were subjected to electroporation in the presence of 150 μg of plasmid as described (27Skinner-Adams T.S. Lawrie P.M. Hawthorne P.L. Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Malaria J. 2003; 2: 19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Parasites resistant to WR99210 were obtained 15-22 days later. Expression of Recombinant Malarial M17 Leucyl Aminopeptidase in Insect Cells—Successful functional expression of the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (PfLAP) was achieved using a truncated form of the enzyme (Fig. 1A). This truncated form was prepared from the synthesized codon-biased leucyl aminopeptidase gene and was amplified by PCR using 5′ primers containing the additional bases CACC to allow directional cloning of the gene into the Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Invitrogen). The primers used were as follows: LAP forward 5′-CACCATGGCTTCTGAGGTTCCAC-3′, and LAP reverse 5′-GCCCTGAAAATACAGGTTTTCCAAAGCGTCGTTCAAAAC-3′. The pENTR construct housing the truncated leucyl aminopeptidase, pENTR-LAP, was verified by DNA sequencing. The verified construct was recombined with BaculoDirect™ C-Term linear DNA (Invitrogen) and transfected into Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells according to the manufacturer's protocol to generate the recombinant baculovirus carrying the aminopeptidase gene. Sf9 insect cells were maintained in serum-free Sf-900II medium (Invitrogen) suspension cultures at 28 °C and orbiting at 120 rpm on a shaker platform. For protein expression, Sf9 insect cells were infected at the cell density 3 × 106 cells/ml with rPfLAP recombinant baculovirus at an multiplicity of infection of 2-5 plaque-forming units/cell. The infections were allowed to proceed for 48 h at 28 °C before the cell pellets were being harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Purification and Molecular Size Analysis of rPfLAP—Baculovirus cells (∼3.5 × 106 cells/ml) containing rPfLAP were stored as ∼15-ml pellets at -80 °C. The pellet was thawed on ice and resuspended in cold PBS to a total volume of 100 ml. The suspension was sonicated three times for 10 s at 2-min intervals using a soni-probe. The suspension was frozen, thawed and sonicated an additional two times. The suspension was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a Sorvall RC-5 centrifuge for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant or soluble extract was filtered on ice through 0.45-μm HA Millipore membrane. The 85-ml filtrate was diluted to a total volume of 425 ml with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole. The resulting protein solution was loaded on a 1-ml nickel-agarose column equilibrated with the same buffer. A sample of the eluate or flow-through was stored for SDS-PAGE analysis. The column was then washed with 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 20 mm imidazole. Leucyl aminopeptidase was eluted from the column in a total volume of 10 ml by addition of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 250 mm imidazole to the column. The eluate was dialyzed against PBS containing 10 μm ZnCl2 for 16 h. Protein concentration of purified enzyme was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay based on the Lowry method (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was the protein standard. Purified rPfLAP and soluble extracts of malaria parasites (>80% trophozoites; prepared as for described for extraction of insect cells above) were analyzed using a Smart System (Amersham Biosciences) HPLC equipped with a Superdex-200 gel filtration column. The samples (40 μl containing 10-20 μg of protein) were passed through the column at a flow rate of 40 μl per min and collected each minute into tubes pre-loaded with 40 μl of 1 mm CoCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Fractions were analyzed for aminopeptidolytic activity toward H-Leu-NHMec and Ala-NHMec as described below. Separation of the molecular size standards of apoferritin (440 kDa), β-amylase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) was monitored at A280. The molecular size of the PfLAP and enzymes in the parasite soluble extracts was calculated from a plot of log Mr versus elution time for these standards. Enzymatic Analysis—Aminopeptidase activity was determined by measuring the release of the fluorogenic leaving group, NHMec, from a range of fluorogenic peptide substrates representative of the various amino acid groupings. Reactions were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates (200 μl total volume, 30 min, 37 °C) using a spectrofluorimeter (Bio-Tek KC4) with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 460 nm. Enzyme was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and containing 1 mm CoCl2 for 20 min before the addition of 10 μm H-Leu-NHMec. Initial rates were obtained at 37 °C over a range of substrate concentrations spanning Km values (0.2-500 μm) and at fixed enzyme concentrations in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Inhibition experiments were carried out in the presence of substrate. Because bestatin and its analogs are time-dependent inhibitors of PfLAP, progress curves were monitored until a final steady state velocity, vs, was reached. Ki values were determined from Dixon plots of 1/vs versus inhibitor concentration when [S] ≪ Km. The metal ion dependence of PfLAP was determined by assaying activity after preincubation of the enzyme (10 min, 37 °C) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing a given metal chloride, before addition of H-Leu-NHMec substrate (10 μm). The PfLAP apoenzyme was prepared by incubation of the enzyme with 10 mm o-phenanthroline in PBS for 15 h, followed by dialysis against PBS overnight. The ability of metal cations to reactivate the PfLAP apoenzyme was determined by assaying its activity following preincubation (10 min, 37 °C) with 0.1 mm metals. Inhibition of PfLAP activity by peptidase inhibitors was investigated by preincubating the enzyme (10 min, 37 °C) with EDTA and o-phenanthroline in 50 mm Tris-Cl, with and without 0.5 mm CoCl2. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was carried out using total RNA extracts from stage-specific parasites (30Keyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 31Hawthorne P. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielman T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W.A. Ortega M.R. Anderson K.L. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The blot was probed with a DNA fragment corresponding to the full-length M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (PF14_0435) DNA coding sequence labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (DECAprime II Ambion). The blots were then stripped and re-probed with the P. falciparum S28 RNA probe to ensure equal loading in the lanes. Polyclonal Antibody Production, Immunofluorescence Assays, and Immunoblotting Analyses—A 15-mer peptide C*AGVSWNFKARKPKG corresponding to the amino acids residues 577-590 of the M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (PF14_0439) was synthesized (Sigma) and conjugated to diphtheria toxin through the N-terminally added cysteine residue. Mice were then immunized three times at 3-week intervals with 30-50 μg of peptidediphtheria toxin conjugate per injection formulated in Freund's Complete and Incomplete Adjuvant (10Gardiner D.L. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Stack C.M. Dalton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1741-1745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Antibodies were also prepared in a similar manner to a recombinant PfLAP expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Immunofluorescence assays were carried out as described before (32Spielmann T. Dixon M.W. Hernandez-Valladares M. Hannemann M. Trenholme K.R. Gardiner D.L. Int. J. Parasitol. 2006; 36: 1245-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) using air-dried P. falciparum-infected red blood cells fixed with acetone. Cells were probed with mouse anti-M17 peptide (1/250) and then Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse AffiniPure antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The parasite nuclei were visualized with Hoechst dye (0.5 μg/ml). Samples were viewed on an Axioscope 2 Mot + (Zeiss) equipped with a Zeiss 63x/1.4 Plan Apochromat lens. Images were captured with an Axiocam MRm camera (Zeiss) using Axiovision AC software (Zeiss). PF14_0435-GPF-tagged transgenic parasites were visualized in a live fluorescence assay. Protein extracts were resolved on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%) and transferred to 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Macherey-Nagel). Membranes were probed with mouse anti-M17 peptide (1/250), stripped, and reprobed with anti-P. falciparum glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibodies (a kind gift of Dr. C. Daubenberger, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel, Switzerland) diluted at 1/2000 to demonstrate equal loading (31Hawthorne P. Trenholme K.R. Skinner-Adams T.S. Spielman T. Fischer K. Dixon M.W.A. Ortega M.R. Anderson K.L. Kemp D.J. Gardiner D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Chemicon) were used at 1/5000, and detection was carried out using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Sensitivity of Parasites to Aminopeptidase Inhibitors—P. falciparum D10 parasites were cultured as described (24Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6122) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of inhibitors were prepared in 100% Me2SO. The in vitro sensitivity of each parasite population to the aminopeptidase inhibitors bestatin {(-)-N-[(2S, 3R)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyryl]-l-leucine}, bestatin methyl ester, and nitrobestatin was determined using [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation (33Skinner-Adams T.S. Davis T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of each inhibitor were prepared in culture media (0.05-50 μm) and added with [3H]hypoxanthine (0.5 μCi/well) to asynchronous cultures at 0.5% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit. After a 48-h incubation, the amount of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation was measured, and the concentrations of inhibitor required to prevent incorporation by 50% (IC50) were determined by linear interpolation of inhibition curves (34Huber W. Koella J. Acta Trop. 1993; 55: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in triplicate on three separate occasions. Phlyogenetic Analysis of P. falciparum M17 Leucyl Aminopeptidase—The C-terminal catalytic region sequence of P. falciparum leucyl aminopeptidase (PF14_0439) (see Fig. 1A) was used to search the BLASTP data base. Selected BLAST hits were aligned with the aid of ClustalW within MEGA version 3.1 suite of programs (35Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. MEGA3: Brief Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10635) Google Scholar). Regions of sequences that were difficult to align because of gaps were removed using Gblocks. Sequences were then realigned using ClustalW, and this alignment was then used to generate a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 (option: Neighbor-Joining, 1000 pseudo-replicates, and gaps were handled by pairwise deletion and distances calculated using Jones-Thornton-Taylor). To determine the strength of the groupings, bootstrap values for nodes were calculated by analyzing 1,000 bootstrap replicate data sets. The P. falciparum M17 Leucyl Aminopeptidase Is Related to Other Apicoplexan Aminopeptidases—The general structure of the P. falciparum M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (PfLAP) is presented as a schematic in Fig. 1A, and its primary sequence is aligned with the LAPs of the various rodent (Plasmodium berghei, P. chabaudi chabaudi,"
https://openalex.org/W2012765618,"Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is a highly conserved chaperone of histones H3/H4 that assembles or disassembles chromatin during transcription, replication, and repair. We have found that budding yeast lacking Asf1 has greatly reduced levels of histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9. Lysine 9 is acetylated on newly synthesized budding yeast histone H3 prior to its assembly onto newly replicated DNA. Accordingly, we found that the vast majority of H3 Lys-9 acetylation peaked in S-phase, and this S-phase peak of H3 lysine 9 acetylation was absent in yeast lacking Asf1. By contrast, deletion of ASF1 has no effect on the S-phase specific peak of H4 lysine 12 acetylation; another modification carried by newly synthesized histones prior to chromatin assembly. We show that Gcn5 is the histone acetyltransferase responsible for the S-phase-specific peak of H3 lysine 9 acetylation. Strikingly, overexpression of Asf1 leads to greatly increased levels of H3 on acetylation on lysine 56 and Gcn5-dependent acetylation on lysine 9. Analysis of a panel of Asf1 mutations that modulate the ability of Asf1 to bind to histones H3/H4 demonstrates that the histone binding activity of Asf1 is required for the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on newly synthesized H3. These results demonstrate that Asf1 does not affect the stability of the newly synthesized histones per se, but instead histone binding by Asf1 promotes the efficient acetylation of specific residues of newly synthesized histone H3.

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleoprotein structure known as chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is made up of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer (two molecules each of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) (1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). Chromatin provides a formidable obstacle to the cellular machinery gaining access to the DNA. Indeed, it is becoming apparent that chromatin is a highly dynamic structure that tightly regulates all nuclear processes that use DNA as a substrate; including transcription, DNA replication, repair, and recombination (2Donaldson A.D. Trends Genet. 2005; 21: 444-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Mellor J. Mol.

Thus, the mechanisms by which chromatin structures are made and modified are fundamental questions of broad interest. The entire eukaryotic genome is assembled into chromatin following DNA replication, and this occurs in a stepwise manner; a tetramer of histones H3/H4 is deposited first followed by two dimers of H2A/H2B on the outside of the tetramer. Histone-binding proteins, termed histone chaperones, mediate chromatin assembly. It is known that when this process is coupled to DNA replication in vitro, it is mediated by the histone H3/H4 chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) 2The abbreviations used are: CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor 1; Asf1, antisilencing function 1; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; WT, wild type SAS, something about silencing. (5Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) together with another H3/H4 chaperone termed anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) (6Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). CAF-1 and Asf1 have also been shown to localize to the sites of DNA replication (7Schulz L.L. Tyler J.K. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 488-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), supporting a role in assembling chromatin following DNA replication in vivo. The fact that CAF-1 and Asf1 co-purify with the replicationspecific histone variant H3.1 from HeLa cells is further evidence that Asf1 and CAF-1 function together to assemble newly replicated DNA into chromatin (9Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). To generate sufficient histones to package both newly replicated daughter genomes into chromatin, the cell produces large amounts of newly synthesized histones at every S-phase. The N-terminal tails of the newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are characteristically modified on specific residues prior to their deposition onto DNA and are termed deposition-specific modifications. For example, new histone H4 is generally acetylated on lysines 5 and 12 (10Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), but following deposition onto the DNA, the newly synthesized H4 is deacetylated over the next 30-60 min (11Jackson V. Shires A. Tanphaichitr N. Chalkley R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which is required for proper chromatin maturation (12Annunziato A.T. Seale R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12675-12684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Newly synthesized histone H3 is also acetylated, although the target residues and pattern of acetylation vary between species. In Drosophila, lysines 14 and 23 are the predominant sites of acetylation, whereas in Tetrahymena, lysines 9 and 14 are preferred (10Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, new H3 is mostly monoacetylated on lysine 9, although lysines 9, 14, 23, and 27 all show some acetylation (13Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). It is currently unknown whether the acetylation marks in the N-terminal tails of the newly synthesized histone H3 are removed rapidly following chromatin assembly, as is the case for H4. The available evidence indicates that acetylation of histone H4 lysines at positions 5 and 12 is not essential for chromatin assembly, although acetylation of either lysines 5, 8, or 12 seems to be required for chromatin assembly in yeast when the N-terminal tail of histone H3 is also deleted (14Ma X.J. Wu J. Altheim B.A. Schultz M.C. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6693-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Despite its requirement for chromatin assembly, the exact purpose of the acetylation of the N-terminal tails of the newly synthesized histones is unclear. Recent evidence also indicates that lysine 56 in the first α helix of H3 is acetylated on newly synthesized histone H3 (15Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). This modification is predicted to allow a looser interaction of the histones with DNA, suggesting that it may contribute to chromatin assembly (15Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 16Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent work has indicated that deletion of the gene encoding the histone chaperone Asf1 greatly reduces the levels of acetylation of H3 on lysine 56 (17Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Similarly, our previous work had found that yeast lacking the histone chaperone Asf1 has greatly reduced levels of acetylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (19Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52069-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To understand how the histone chaperone Asf1 is leading to normal levels of acetylation on lysines 9 and 56 of histone H3, we further investigated the relationship between Asf1 and histone H3 acetylation. We show that Asf1 is not required for stabilization of the newly synthesized histones per se, but instead Asf1 promotes the Gcn5-mediated S-phase peak of acetylation of lysine 9 on newly synthesized histone H3. Consistent with this result, overexpression of Asf1 results in greatly increased acetylation of lysines 9 and 56. The role of Asf1 in modulating acetylation of nascent H3 is dependent on its ability to bind to histones H3/H4. As such, we propose that Asf1 properly presents the newly synthesized histone H3 for acetylation by Gcn5 and the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) mediating Lys-56 acetylation prior to chromatin assembly. Yeast Strains and Growth—All strains were made using standard yeast molecular genetics techniques and are listed in Table 1. All yeast growth was in yeast extract peptone supplemented with 2% dextrose or galactose if stated as such in the figure legend. All analyses were performed in the logarithmic phase of growth. URA3 plasmids were maintained by growth in minimal medium lacking uracil. Cell cycle arrest of BAR1-deleted strains was achieved by addition of α-factor to a final concentration of 15 nm for multiple hours. Arrest was assessed by visual inspection at the time of the experiment and confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of propidium iodide strained cells. Release from arrest was achieved by washing the cells and resuspending in fresh medium containing Pronase.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyJCY0011W303a MAT a ade2-1; trp1-1; can1-100; leu2-3,112; his3-11,15; ura3; GAL+ psi; GCN5::9myc::TRP1; asf1::his5+ (this study)JKT0010W303a MAT a; his3-11; leu2-3,112; lys2; trp1-1; ura3-1; bar1::LEU2 (Ref. 35Adkins M.W.

The pellets were resuspended in 75 μl of sample buffer (0.06 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% (w/v) bromphenol blue). 10 μl of each whole cell extract was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used for Western blot analysis: anti-His (Qiagen, 34660), H3 (Abcam, ab-1791), H4 (Cell Signaling, 2592), AcH3K9 (Cell Signaling, 9671), AcH3K9K14 (Upstate, 15-599), AcH4 (Upstate, 06-933), AcH4K12 (Cell Signaling, 2591), and AcH3K56 (Upstate, 07-677). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) followed by exposure to autoradiography film. The linearity of the signal was verified by taking a range of exposures for all blots shown to ensure that the presented images were not subjected to saturation. We have previously shown that the steady-state acetylation level on H3 lysine 9, but not on the other residues in the N-terminal tails of H3 and H4, was greatly reduced in asynchronously growing yeast deleted for the gene encoding the histone chaperone Asf1 (19Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52069-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). This reduced acetylation on histone H3 Lys-9 upon deletion of ASF1 was observed in multiple independently derived strains, indicating that it was not because of a second site mutation in the strain background (data not shown). Histone acetylation on lysine 9 can be divided into two types: (a) deposition-specific acetylation that occurs on nascent newly synthesized histones prior to chromatin assembly; and (b) acetylation on chromatin, such as during the processes of transcriptional regulation. To understand whether one or both types of lysine 9 acetylation were reduced in the absence of Asf1, we examined H3 lysine 9 acetylation through the cell cycle. We arrested yeast deleted for ASF1 (asf1Δ) and wild type yeast in G1 phase of the cell cycle with α-factor, then released them from the arrest, and took samples through the subsequent cell cycle (Fig. 1A). We assigned the approximate phase in the cell cycle from flow cytometry analysis of DNA content (Fig. 1A). Upon Western blotting total cell extracts for acetylated H3 lysine 9 through the cell cycle, we observed a striking peak of acetylation correlating with S-phase in the wild type cells (Fig. 1A), which presumably reflected the deposition-specific acetylation of H3 Lys-9. This result shows that that the vast majority of H3 Lys-9 acetylation in the cell occurs in an S-phase-specific peak (Fig. 1). This pattern closely resembles that of acetylation of lysine 56 on newly synthesized H3 prior to chromatin assembly (15Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), suggesting that the S-phase peak of H3 Lys-9 acetylation that we observed also reflects the acetylation of newly synthesized H3. The fact that the H3 lysine 9 acetylation levels go down after S-phase indicates for the first time that the deposition-specific acetylation on the N-terminal tail of H3 is removed following replication-dependent chromatin assembly, as is the case for the deposition-specific acetylation marks on the N terminus of histone H4 (11Jackson V. Shires A. Tanphaichitr N. Chalkley R. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type cells, the peak of S-phase-specific H3 lysine 9 acetylation was absent from the asf1Δ cells (Fig. 1A). The dependence on Asf1 for lysine 9 acetylation on histone H3 prior to chromatin assembly (Fig. 1) is reminiscent of the requirement of Asf1 acetylation of lysine 56 on newly synthesized histone H3 (17Recht J. Tsubota T. Tanny J.C. Diaz R.L. Berger J.M. Zhang X. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Burlingame A.L. Hunt D.F. Kaufman P.D. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6988-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 18Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that Asf1 promotes (or stabilizes) the acetylation of the newly synthesized histones. To investigate whether Asf1 also influences the acetylation of H3 lysine 9 on chromatin, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis at the promoters and open reading frames of genomic regions that are known to be enriched in lysine 9 acetylation (20Kurdistani S.K. Tavazoie S. Grunstein M. Cell. 2004; 117: 721-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We found no difference in H3 lysine 9 acetylation levels on chromatin in wild type and asf1Δ cells (supplemental Fig. 1). The low level of H3 Lys-9 acetylation that persists in asf1 mutant cells may reflect the acetylation on chromatin (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that whereas Asf1 promotes Lys-9 acetylation of the nascent H3, Asf1 does not influence H3 Lys-9 acetylation on chromatin. To investigate the consequence of the loss of acetylation on newly synthesized histone H3, we combined the asf1Δ with strains lacking either the H3 or H4 N-terminal tail. We found that yeast lacking both the H4 N-terminal tail and ASF1 was inviable, whereas yeast lacking both ASF1 and the N-terminal tail of histone H3 was viable (Fig. 1B). Although it is possible that the inviability is because of other roles of Asf1 in the cell, this result suggests that loss of H3 lysine 9 and lysine 56 acetylation together with loss of the acetylatable lysines on histone H4 may result in a level of acetylation on newly synthesized histones that falls below the threshold required for chromatin assembly in yeast (14Ma X.J. Wu J. Altheim B.A. Schultz M.C. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6693-6698Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There are two possibilities that could explain the reduced level of the deposition-specific acetylations on histone H3 (lysines 9 and 56) in asf1 mutants. First, the ability of Asf1 to act as a histone chaperone may stabilize the soluble pool of histones H3/H4, by either reducing its turn over via degradation or by reducing its rate of assembly onto chromatin. Second, Asf1 may promote the ability of the HATs to perform acetylation on newly synthesized H3. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined the deposition-specific acetylation on histone H4. If Asf1 is stabilizing H3 it would also be expected to stabilize H4, as H3 and H4 always exist as heterodimers. We had previously shown that the levels of acetylation of H4 lysines 5 and 12 are not altered in yeast lacking ASF1 (19Adkins M.W. Tyler J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52069-52074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, these analyses examined histone acetylation in asynchronous cultures of cells, and it was unknown whether the transcriptionspecific acetylation may be masking a defect in the deposition specific acetylation of histone H4. To investigate this possibility, we examined H4 Lys-12 acetylation through the cell cycle to determine whether there is an S-phase-specific peak (Fig. 2), as seen for H3 Lys-9 acetylation (Fig. 1A). We observed a clear S-phase-specific peak of H4 Lys-12 acetylation in wild type cells, indicating that the deposition-specific acetylation of H4 Lys-12 is the most abundant form of this modification in the cell. Importantly, the S-phase-specific peak of H4 Lys-12 acetylation was also present in asf1 mutant cells, albeit slightly delayed because asf1 mutants had an elongated S-phase (supplemental Fig. 2). Because the deposition-specific acetylation of H3 but not H4 is affected in asf1 mutant cells, and because H3 and H4 are always tightly associated as heterodimers in the cell, this result indicates that Asf1 does not affect histone acetylation indirectly by stabilizing soluble histones H3/H4. Asf1 itself does not have HAT activity (data not shown) indicating that a distinct protein mediates H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56 acetylation with HAT activity. To identify which HAT is responsible for the S-phase peak of acetylation on lysine 9 on newly synthesized H3, we examined yeast deleted for GCN5, HAT1, SPT10, or SAS3 encoding HATs and the YNG2 component of the NuA4 HAT complex (data not shown). When we examined yeast deleted for GCN5 (gcn5Δ), we observed a complete absence of the S-phase peak of acetylation of H3 Lys-9 but not H4 Lys-12 (Fig. 3A). This result indicates that Gcn5 is the HAT for the deposition-specific acetylation of soluble histone H3 in vivo. To rule out an indirect affect of ASF1 deletion on Gcn5 expression or stability we compared Gcn5 protein and transcript levels in asf1Δ and wild type yeast. We found no significant changes in the transcript levels of any known HAT or histone deacetylase upon the deletion of ASF1 (21Zabaronick S.R. Tyler J.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the steady-state levels of Gcn5 protein are indistinguishable between wild type and asf1 mutant yeast (Fig. 3B). Gcn5 however is not the HAT responsible for the S-phase peak of acetylation of histone H3 Lys-56 (supplemental Fig. 3). As such, our data indicate that Asf1 may present the newly synthesized histone H3 to Gcn5 or promote the activity of Gcn5 toward lysine 9. We were interested to investigate whether any of the mutant phenotypes of yeast deleted for ASF1 (6Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) may be a consequence of the absence of Gcn5-mediated deposition-specific acetylation of lysine 9 of H3. We found that yeast deleted for GCN5 or ASF1 were equally sensitive to the radiomimetic agent bleomycin that resulted in double-strand DNA damage; the gcn5Δasf1Δ strain was even more sensitive to bleomycin than either single mutation (Fig. 3C). The growth defect of the gcn5Δasf1Δ strain was also more apparent than that of yeast deleted for either GCN5 or ASF1, as seen by the smaller colony size on rich medium (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that Asf1 and Gcn5 have non-overlapping roles in the cell that are not related to the requirement of both proteins for acetylation of H3 Lys-9. To further investigate the relationship between Asf1 and H3 acetylation, we asked whether excess Asf1 could promote H3 acetylation. Although deletion of ASF1 reduced H3 Lys-9 acetylation, we found that the overexpression of Asf1 in yeast greatly increased the levels of acetylated H3 Lys-9 but had no effect on H4 acetylation (Fig. 4A). Notably, overexpression of Asf1 did not increase levels of H3 Lys-9 acetylation on chromatin (supplemental Fig. 1). Similarly, although deletion of ASF1 reduced H3 Lys-56 acetylation, the overexpression of Asf1 greatly increased the levels of acetylated H3 Lys-56 in the cell (Fig. 4B). The increased Lys-9 acetylation was not dependent on Gcn5, suggesting that overexpression of Asf1 caused additional HATs to acetylate this residue (Fig. 4C). Because acetylation on H4 did not increase upon overexpression of Asf1, these results suggest that the increased H3 acetylation was not because of the excess Asf1 stabilizing the pool of soluble acetylated histones H3/H4. Instead, these data are consistent with wild type levels of Asf1 normally being limited in the cell for the optimal presentation of soluble histone H3 to the HATs, such that overexpression of Asf1 results in more H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56 acetylation. To gain further insight into the mechanism whereby Asf1 promotes acetylation of the free histones on lysines 9 and 56 of H3, we tested mutations in the histone-binding interface of Asf1. We have recently solved the 1.7 Å crystal structure of the Asf1/H3/H4 complex and from this structure we identified mutations that disrupt the interaction between Asf1 and H3/H4 in yeast and in vitro (22English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E.A. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In general, our conservative single amino acid substitutions (S48R, V109M, V146L) reduced the Asf1-H3/H4 interaction to a lesser extent than our double amino acids substitutions or the V94R disruptive mutation (22English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E.A. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of these Asf1 substitutions on the ability of Asf1 to promote acetylation of H3 lysines 9 and 56 (Fig. 5A). We found that mutations in either the H3 or H4 binding interface of Asf1 resulted in reduced H3 acetylation (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, although single amino acid substitutions that had reduced H3/H4 binding only had a subtle effect on H3 acetylation, the V94R, and double amino acid substitutions in Asf1 that had a profound effect on H3/H4 binding also had a profound effect on H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56 acetylation (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that the ability of Asf1 to influence the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on free histones is intimately related to its histone binding activity. Asf1 Is Likely to Present the Newly Synthesized Free Histone H3 to the HATs—Given that Asf1 only affects acetylation of soluble H3, not soluble H4 or chromatin-bound histones (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 1), we propose that Asf1 delivers or presents the histones in an appropriate manner to the HATs for H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56 acetylation. Previous evidence has shown that a complex containing Gcn5 purifies with newly synthesized histones, and this was proposed to be the HAT for S-phase-specific acetylation of H3 (23Sklenar A.R. Parthun M.R. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, we show that the S-phase peak of histone H3 Lys-9 acetylation does not occur in gcn5 mutants (Fig. 3), demonstrating that Gcn5 is the HAT for acetylation of Lys-9 on newly synthesized histone H3 in the cell. It is possible that Asf1 regulates the activity of Gcn5 via a direct interaction. However, no direct interaction between Asf1 and Gcn5 has been reported so far. Asf1 has been reported to bind to the bromodomain-containing proteins Brd1 and Brd2 in yeast and Brahma in Drosophila (24Chimura T. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9334-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Moshkin Y.M. Armstrong J.A. Maeda R.K. Tamkun J.W. Verrijzer P. Kennison J.A. Karch F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2621-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As Gcn5 does contain a bromodomain (26Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Berger S.L. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it may be a potential binding partner of Asf1 that merits further investigation in the future. Notably, no detectable HAT activities toward full-length H3 copurified with Asf1 from yeast cells, although an H4-specific HAT activity (presumably the SAS complex) did co-purify with Asf1 (data not shown). As such, if there is an interaction between Asf1 and Gcn5, it must be very transient. Although Spt10 is the HAT required for acetylation of H3 Lys-56 on chromatin (16Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the identity of the HAT required for acetylation of Lys-56 on the newly synthesized histones prior to chromatin assembly is unclear, but it is not Spt10, Sas3, or Gcn5 (Fig. 4C). The only HAT known to associate with Asf1 to date is the SAS complex, composed of Sas2, Sas4, and Sas5 (27Osada S. Sutton A. Muster N. Brown C.E. Yates III, J.R. Sternglanz R. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The SAS complex can acetylate the N-terminal tails of free histones H3 and H4; although somewhat surprisingly, the SAS complex cannot acetylate histones bound to Asf1 (28Sutton A. Shia W.J. Band D. Kaufman P.D. Osada S. Workman J.L. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16887-16892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although the HAT for acetylation of soluble Lys-56 is unknown, the SAS complex is an unlikely candidate because inactivation of this complex does not cause sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (27Osada S. Sutton A. Muster N. Brown C.E. Yates III, J.R. Sternglanz R. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) as is the case for yeast unable to acetylate H3 Lys-56 (15Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). It is possible that the binding of histones H3/H4 to Asf1 may induce a conformational change in histone H3 that makes it a more favorable target for acetylation by Gcn5 and the Lys-56 HAT. Because H3 Lys-9 and Lys-56 are not included in the structure of the Asf1·H3/H4 complex (22English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E.A. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we do not yet know whether binding to Asf1 induces a conformational change toward the N-terminal region of H3 that may improve the fit into the active site of Gcn5 and Lys-56 HAT. However, this is a possibility, as we observed numerous conformational changes throughout histones H3 and H4 upon binding to Asf1 as compared with their conformation in the nucleosome structure (29Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we do not think that the influence of Asf1 on H3 acetylation levels could be because of any potential role for Asf1 in shielding histone H3 from deacetylation following its deposition onto the DNA because the crystal structure of Asf1 bound to H3/H4 (22English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E.A. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) indicates that Asf1 must be removed from histones H3/H4 to enable interaction with histones H2A/H2B and the DNA within the nucleosome. Our biophysical and structural analyses have clearly shown that the binding of Asf1 to the histone H3/H4 heterodimer envelops the surface of H3 that would otherwise mediate formation of the H3/H4 heterotetramer (30English C.M. Maluf N.K. Tripet B. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13673-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Upon deletion of ASF1, this H3-H3 interaction interface of the H3/H4 heterodimer is no longer shielded, and it is likely that the soluble H3/H4 in the cell would associate into H3/H4 heterotetramers prior to chromatin assembly. H3/H4 heterotetramerization in the absence of Asf1 may itself induce conformational changes in the soluble histone H3 that may in turn reduce its ability to be acetylated. This will be difficult to determine until a molecular structure of the free H3/H4 heterotetramer is solved. Alternatively, the proposed heterotetramerization of H3/H4 in the absence of Asf1 may present new binding sites for proteins that block access to the HATs of soluble H3. The location and pattern of residues on histone H3 that are acetylated in a deposition-specific manner vary largely between different species (10Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 13Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Toward differentiating between some of the possible models above, it would be interesting to determine whether the acetylation of the different deposition-related H3 residues is reduced in other organisms lacking Asf1 function. This may provide insight into whether Asf1 is inducing a conformational change in the newly synthesized histones upon binding to them, or whether the presentation of H3/H4 as a heterodimer by Asf1 make them more favorable for acetylation. A final possibility is that Asf1 may influence the cellular or sub-cellular localization of the soluble histones, which may affect their delivery to the HATs. It is interesting to note that HAT1, which acetylates Lys-5 and Lys-12 on newly synthesized soluble histone H4, was originally termed the cytoplasmic HAT (31Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18576-18582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), although it is now known to be mostly nuclear (33Poveda A. Pamblanco M. Tafrov S. Tordera V. Sternglanz R. Sendra R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16033-16043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it is still a matter of debate as to where the acetylation of soluble histones occurs, and there is evidence that H4 is acetylated in the cytoplasm (34Glowczewski L. Waterborg J.H. Berman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10180-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although Asf1 is not essential for the nuclear import of histones H3/H4 (given the viability of asf1Δ mutants), it is possible that the absence of Asf1 leads to H3/H4 spending more time in the cytoplasm where they have access to the H4 HAT and less accessibility to the nuclear H3 HATs. Notably, we have not observed increased cytoplasmic staining of green fluorescent protein-tagged histones in yeast deleted for asf1 in budding yeast (data not shown); although it is possible that any cytoplasmic signal would be overpowered by the intense nuclear staining provided by the chromatinized histones. Whatever the details of how the histone chaperone Asf1 affects acetylation of lysines 9 and 56 residues on soluble H3, it is clear that the histone binding ability of Asf1 is absolutely required for these acetylation events (Fig. 5). It is important to note that the histone H3/H4 molecules that are bound to Asf1 are seemingly 100% acetylated at every deposition-specific acetylatable lysine in the N-terminal tails (6Tyler J.K. Adams C.R. Chen S.R. Kobayashi R. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Nature. 1999; 402: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). By contrast, analysis of all newly synthesized histones H3/H4 shows them to be less than 100% acetylated (10Sobel R.E. Cook R.G. Perry C.A. Annunziato A.T. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This saturated acetylation on the newly synthesized H3/H4 bound to Asf1 is fully consistent with our proposal that the binding of H3/H4 to Asf1 potentiates their acetylation. Furthermore, the fact that overexpression of Asf1 greatly increases the levels of Lys-9 and Lys-56 acetylation in the cell (Fig. 4) suggests that the amounts of Asf1 are limiting in the cell, as far as its role in presenting newly synthesized histone H3 to Gcn5 and the Lys-56 HAT. Finally, having found that acetylation of the soluble histones at H4 Lys-12 and H3 Lys-9 acetylation is apparent by an S-phase peak (Figs. FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), we now have a simple assay for the identification of enzymes involved in the acetylation and deacetylation of newly synthesized histones. The HAT for Lys-12 acetylation on newly synthesized H4 is known to be HAT1 (32Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and we have now shown the HAT for acetylation of newly synthesized H3 Lys-9 is Gcn5. Similarly, this approach could be applied to identify the histone deacetylases that deacetylate H4 Lys-12 and H3 Lys-9 rapidly after chromatin assembly. We thank Christine English, Josh Ramey, and Jeff Linger for critical reading of the manuscript.

It is unclear whether diabetes treatment should aim at restoring β-cell performance/mass or at inducing “β-cell rest” to prevent further deterioration. The transcription factor Foxo1 protects β-cells against oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia and prevents β-cell replication in insulin-resistant states. Here we show that these combined effects are associated with a concerted repression of genes involved in glycolysis, nitric-oxide synthesis, G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and ion transport. Conversely, Foxo1 increases expression of several neurotransmitter receptors and fails to regulate target genes predicted from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila studies. Functional analyses show decreased glucose utilization and insulin secretion in β-cells overexpressing Foxo1. We propose the definition of “metabolic diapause” for the changes induced by Foxo1 to protect β-cells against oxidative stress. The data provide genetic underpinning for the concept of β-cell rest as a treatment goal in diabetes. Diabetes is associated with decreased pancreatic β-cell function and mass.

We propose the definition of “metabolic diapause” for the changes induced by Foxo1 to protect β-cells against oxidative stress. The data provide genetic underpinning for the concept of β-cell rest as a treatment goal in diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function (1Accili D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Defects of β-cell function in diabetes are complex and include reduced insulin secretion and alterations of β-cell mass (2Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are both genetic and acquired (environmental) components to β-cell failure. Thus, an impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be detected in nondiabetic first degree relatives of diabetic patients, consistent with a genetic predisposition (3O'Rahilly S. Turner R.C. Matthews D.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 4Polonsky K.S. Given B.D. Hirsch L.J. Tillil H. Shapiro E.T. Beebe C. Frank B.H. Galloway J.A. Van Cauter E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). However, following the onset of diabetes, hyperglycemia itself causes a deterioration of insulin secretion, which can be partly reversed by improved glycemic control (5Leahy J.L. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), demonstrating a role of acquired metabolic abnormalities in β-cell failure (6Ferrannini E. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Indeed, an apparently inexorable decline of β-cell function is a hallmark of diabetes and a major cause of therapeutic failure (7Levy J. Atkinson A.B. Bell P.M. McCance D.R. Hadden D.R. Diabet. Med. 1998; 15: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).Agents that reverse or prevent β-cell failure play an important role in diabetes treatment, and two new classes of drugs that target β-cells have been recently introduced as adjuvant treatments for diabetes (8Drucker D.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 153-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). There persists, however, a fundamental ambiguity about the goal of therapies targeting the β-cell. Simply put, the question is whether the goal should be to preserve β-cell function by reducing the metabolic demand on the β-cell (“β-cell rest”) (9Leahy J.L. Bumbalo L.M. Chen C. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Ritzel R.A. Hansen J.B. Veldhuis J.D. Butler P.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 122-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or to increase β-cell performance in the face of high metabolic demand (14Baggio L.L. Drucker D.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).It remains unclear whether the two primary components of β-cell failure, impaired insulin secretion and reduced β-cell mass (15Butler A.E. Janson J. Bonner-Weir S. Ritzel R. Rizza R.A. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar), are mechanistically linked. Turnover studies in mice support the view that β-cells are capable of a limited number of replications (16Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), suggesting that the decrease of β-cell mass in humans with diabetes is the result of an exhaustion of the proliferative capacity of the β-cell. Thus, understanding the mechanism linking β-cell renewal and insulin secretion can provide clues to the best therapeutic approach to β-cell failure.The forkhead transcription factor Foxo1 regulates β-cell proliferation in insulin-resistant states (17Kitamura T.

Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In addition, Foxo1 activity in β-cells is modulated by GLP-1 (23Buteau J. Spatz M.L. Accili D. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1190-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), glucose (24Martinez S.C. Cras-Meneur C. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and oleic acid (25Wrede C.E. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. Briaud I. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49676-49684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, Foxo1 represents a potential relay node to integrate β-cell function in response to nutrients and hormones with β-cell turnover. To understand the mechanism by which Foxo1 controls these processes, we determined the RNA expression profile of cultured β-cells with a gain of function in Foxo1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Cell Culture—Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen, 5-3H- and U-14C-labeled glucose were from Amersham Biosciences, and anti-Foxo1 antiserum was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Clone 832/13 derived from INS1 cells (26Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) (passages 46-70) was expanded and grown in monolayer cultures (27Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Western blot was performed according to standard procedures on proteins isolated during RNA extraction (28Lauro D. Kido Y. Castle A.L. Zarnowski M.J. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Accili D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA protein assay.Recombinant Adenovirus Transduction—The mutant Foxo1 carries single amino acid substitutions replacing the three main phosphorylation sites, Thr24 → Ala, Ser253 → Asp, and Ser316 → Ala, and has been described previously (29Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). INS832/13 cells were seeded 2 days before use and transduced with adenovirus encoding Foxo1 or β-galactosidase at a multiplicity of infection of 50 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h in 1 ml of complete medium. The adenoviral solution was replaced with complete medium, and cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before the experiment. Under these conditions, >95% of the cells are transduced (not shown).Gene Expression—RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from three independent experiments. Semiquantitative or quantitative real time PCRs (Opticon 2, MJ Research, Waltham, MA) were performed as described previously (30Okamoto H. Nakae J. Kitamura T. Park B.C. Dragatsis I. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Primer sequences are available upon request.Cell Proliferation—INS832/13 cell proliferation was evaluated using a BrdUrd 3The abbreviations used are: BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; FFA, free fatty acid. enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Roche Applied Science). Adenovirus-transduced INS832/13 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (8 × 104 cells/well) and allowed to recover for 24 h. BrdUrd was added to the culture medium for 1 h, and cells were fixed, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody, and the immune complexes were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Bio-Rad).Cell Death and Apoptosis—Cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured until 80% confluent. Following transduction with β-galactosidase or Foxo1 or treatment with 25 μm H2O2 for 1 h to induce apoptosis (31Hui H. Nourparvar A. Zhao X. Perfetti R. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1444-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we measured caspase-3 activation and cell toxicity using the CaspACE and CytoTox 96 cytotoxicity (Promega) assay systems, respectively. The CytoTox 96 assay measures the release of cytoplasmic enzymes in the medium upon loss of membrane integrity as a result of cytotoxicity. Simultaneously, cells were harvested to measure apoptosis. After a brief centrifugation at 450 × g, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer, and caspase-3 activity was determined by adding assay buffer containing the DEVD-p-nitroanilide substrate.Insulin Secretion and Total Insulin Content Assays—70% confluent INS832/13 cells were seeded in 24-well plates 1 day before use. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed and incubated for 30 min in 2.8 mm glucose KRBH buffer before incubation for 30 min at different glucose concentrations (2.8 and 16 mm) or 35 mm KCl to induce cell depolarization. At the end of the incubation, culture medium was collected, centrifuged to remove cells, and assayed for rat/human insulin content by radioimmunoassay (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Total insulin content was measured after acid ethanol extraction (32Havrankova J. Roth J. Brownstein M. Nature. 1978; 272: 827-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar).Glucose Metabolism—We measured glucose oxidation as 14CO2 production from [U-14C]glucose and glucose utilization by measuring 3H2O production from [5-3H]glucose (33Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We carried out the two determinations simultaneously and terminated the reactions by the addition of 40% perchloric acid. Tritiated water was separated by chromatography on AG1X8 column (Bio-Rad). 14CO2 was captured by glass fiber filters previously soaked in 5% KOH.Microarray Analysis—RNA was isolated from INS832/13 cells 24 h post-transduction using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from four replicate samples. RNA samples were reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to a rat 230A DNA microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mean expression value of samples derived from cells overexpressing Foxo1 and β-galactosidase was compared for each set of probes. Of the 15,924 sets of probes represented on the microarray, 4725 were considered present in at least one of the two conditions according to the software threshold, and 2237 changed significantly upon CN-Foxo1 overexpression, using a false discovery rate of 5% to declare significance. Among these, we detected 721 known genes and 1516 expressed sequence tags. The full list of genes with an altered expression profile is shown in supplemental Table 1. Gene expression data were further analyzed with the ErmineJ bioinformatics tool. ErmineJ performs analyses of gene sets in expression microarray data to determine whether specific biological pathways are significantly altered. We used p ≤ 0.05 as a threshold to declare significance.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were used as described (34Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). 106 INS823/13 cells were growth-arrested by serum deprivation overnight, fixed in 1% formaldehyde, washed, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Samples were sonicated to shear DNA to lengths of 200-1,000 bp, and the material was immunoprecipitated with anti-Foxo1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). DNA was recovered and amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides flanking the assayed promoter regions (34Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and Student's t test. We used p < 0.05 to declare statistically significant differences.RESULTSRNA Profiling of INS832/13 Cells Overexpressing Foxo1—We reasoned that, if Foxo1 protects β-cells against hyperglycemia, the transcriptional profile of β-cells expressing constitutively nuclear Foxo1 (Foxo1-ADA, bearing mutations of Akt phosphorylation sites) (22Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) should reveal the mechanism(s) of this protective effect. Since we previously showed that the Foxo1 response is identical in cultured β-cells and primary islets (22Kitamura Y.I. Kitamura T. Kruse J.P. Raum J.C. Stein R. Gu W. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 153-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), in this study we used cultured β-cells (clone INS832/13) to allow for efficient adenoviral transduction. To minimize artifacts associated with gain-of-function of transcription factors, we used moderate overexpression and monitored its effects on cell survival and canonical Foxo1 target genes. Immunoblot analysis indicated that Foxo1 levels increased ∼5-fold following Foxo1 transduction (Fig. 1A) and resulted in a ∼6-fold increase of Ifgbp1 expression (Fig. 1B, Table 1), similar to previous reports (17Kitamura T.

These data confirm the extent of the changes observed in the microarray (Table 1). To sample Foxo1 occupancy of candidate forkhead sites in target promoters, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We detected Foxo1 at the Igfbp1, Foxa2, and Isl1 promoters (Fig. 2), consistent with the idea that these genes are direct targets of Foxo1.FIGURE 2Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We isolated intact chromatin from Foxo1-transduced cells and performed immunoprecipitation with control (c) or anti-Foxo1 antiserum (Foxo1). Input DNA is shown in the right-hand lane.

The predicted outcome of these changes would be decreased glucose utilization and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3A). In control cells, changes in glucose concentration from 2.8 to 16 mm resulted in a 3-fold increase of glucose oxidation (Fig. 3B). These data support the findings of the RNA profiling studies.

Consistent with the decrease in glucose utilization and oxidation, Foxo1 inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion, whereas the control β-galactosidase adenovirus had no effect (Fig. 3D). We also observed a decrease in KCl-induced insulin secretion that is likely to result from decreased expression of several ion channels (supplemental Table 3).A decrease in glycolysis would also be predicted to lower malonyl-CoA levels, resulting in increased FFA oxidation (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, Foxo1 increased FFA oxidation ∼3-fold. Thus, Foxo1 induces a shift from glycolysis to FFA oxidation in β-cells.FIGURE 4Foxo effect on FFA oxidation.

RNA profiling of Foxo1-expressing β-cells revealed profound changes to this pathway (Table 3). We detected a 6-fold decrease in GTP cyclohydrolase, the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor required for nitricoxide synthase activity (37Alp N.J. Mussa S. Khoo J.

Moreover, there were decreases of several enzymes in the urea cycle, which would be expected to decrease the levels of arginine, the NH2 donor for NO synthesis. In this context, the 8-fold decrease of arginase-1, the enzyme that metabolizes arginine to ornithine and urea, is likely to be secondary to decreased substrate synthesis. Although a decrease in arginase levels should lead to increased arginine availability for NO synthesis, it is unclear that this would result in increased NO production, because arginase inhibitors do not affect nitric oxide synthesis in β-cells (39Stickings P.

The calcium-regulated serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin has been implicated in the transduction of motor neuron signals to alter gene expression programs in skeletal muscle. We utilized transgenic mice that overexpress an activated form of calcineurin in skeletal muscle (MCK-CnA*) to investigate the impact of calcineurin activation on metabolic properties of skeletal muscle. Activation of calcineurin increased glucose incorporation into glycogen and lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Activated calcineurin suppressed skeletal muscle glucose oxidation and increased lactate release. The enhancement in lipid oxidation was supported by increased expression of genes for lipid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In a reciprocal fashion, several genes of glycolysis were down-regulated, whereas pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 was markedly induced. This expression pattern was associated with decreased glucose utilization and enhanced glycogen storage. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) are transcription regulators for the expression of metabolic and mitochondrial genes. Consistent with changes in the gene-regulatory program, calcineurin promoted the expression of PPARα, PPARδ, and PPARγ coactivator 1α in skeletal muscle. These results provide evidence that calcineurin-mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming induces the expression of several transcription regulators that coordinate changes in the expression of genes for lipid and glucose metabolism, which in turn alters energy substrate utilization in skeletal muscle.

These results provide evidence that calcineurin-mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming induces the expression of several transcription regulators that coordinate changes in the expression of genes for lipid and glucose metabolism, which in turn alters energy substrate utilization in skeletal muscle. The metabolic property of skeletal muscle is highly flexible and adapts to various physiological demands by altering energy substrate utilization (1Andres R. Cader G. Zierler K.L. J. Clin.

Skeletal muscle can be classified into two categories based on the distinct metabolic and contractile activity: fast glycolytic fibers that derive energy primarily from glycolysis for sudden rapid movement and slow oxidative fibers that rely mainly on oxidation of energy substrates for sustained recurring activity. Although such diversity has been long recognized, the cellular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle metabolic properties remain largely elusive. Signals from the motor neurons are critical factors in regulating the metabolic properties of skeletal muscle (3Pette D. Vrbova G.

Furthermore, the expression of Glut4 (glucose transporter 4) and activity of Hk2 (hexokinase 2), two proteins that are essential for glucose uptake and storage, are increased in skeletal muscle after electrical stimulation (9Kong X.

Although electrical stimulation represents an artificial model of contractile activity-induced motor neuron activity (3Pette D. Vrbova G.

In this study, we investigated the impact of calcineurin-mediated skeletal muscle reprogramming on the energy substrate utilization and determined whether calcineurin induces metabolic adaptations via coordinated changes in gene expression. We tested the hypothesis that calcineurin activates the slow fiber gene regulatory program by activating PPARα, PPARδ, and PGC1α. Transgenic Mice—A line of transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of calcineurin (18O'Keefe S.J. Tamura J. Kincaid R.L. Tocci M.J. O'Neill E.A.

Female MCK-CnA* mice and wild-type littermates were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle and allowed free access to water and standard rodent chow. Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% avertin (0.02 ml/g of body weight), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were removed for in vitro incubation or expression analysis. We studied EDL and soleus muscles because they display different contractile and metabolic properties. EDL muscles from wild-type mice contain predominantly fast twitch fibers and ∼2% type I (slow oxidative) fibers, whereas soleus muscles are composed of ∼50% type I fibers, with the remaining percentage attributed mainly to type IIa (fast oxidative) fibers (19Tsao T.S Li J.

The mice were humanely killed by cervical dislocation immediately after muscle dissection. The Ethics Committee on Animal Research in Northern Stockholm approved all experimental procedures. RNA Purification and cDNA Synthesis—EDL was homogenized in 800 μl of Trizol reagent (Sigma), and RNA was purified according to recommendations of the manufacturer. Purified RNA was then treated with DNase I, using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNase-treated RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primers. A reaction without reverse transcriptase was included for each sample to serve as reverse transcriptase-minus control. Quantitative Real Time PCR—The quantity of cDNA for each transcript was measured using real time PCR with the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector system and fluorescence-based SYBR-green technology (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μl, consisting of diluted cDNA sample, 1× SYBR-green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), primers optimized for each target gene, and nuclease-free water. All samples were analyzed in duplicate. Relative quantities of target transcripts were calculated from duplicate samples after normalization of the data against a housekeeping gene (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO) using the standard curve method. Primers were designed using Primer Express computer software (Applied Biosystems). Transcript sequences obtained from the ENSEMBL data base were Cpt1 (carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1; ENSMUST00000023287), Cd36 (ENSMUST00000003024), Cs (citrate synthase; ENSMUST00000005826), Hadsc (short chain HAD; ENSMUST00000029610), Lpl (ENSMUST00000015712), Pfkm (muscle 6-phosphofructokinase; ENSMUST00000043950), Pdk4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; ENSMUST00000019721), and sequences from the NCBI GenBank™ data base were acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO (BC003833), Aldoa (aldolase A; NM007438), Cpt2 (NM009949), Decr1 (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1; NM026172), Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BC095932), Ldh (lactate dehydrogenase; NM008492), Slc25a20 (mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase; NM020520), and Acadvl (very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; NM017366). Muscle Incubations—Incubation media were prepared from stocks of pregassed (95% O2, 5%CO2) Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 5 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade). EDL and soleus muscle were excised and incubated at 30 °C in a shaking water bath under a constant gas phase (95% O2/5% CO2) unless stated otherwise. Glucose Oxidation, Glucose Incorporation into Glycogen, and Lactate Release—Muscles were incubated (30 °C for 60 min) in 1 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 8 mm [U-14C]glucose (0.3 μCi/ml) with or without insulin (12 nm). Vials were sealed with a rubber stopper, which was fitted with a center well. Muscles were oxygenated for the first 60 min of the incubation period via a needle inserted through the stopper. After 60 min, muscles were removed from the vial, trimmed of excess tendon, and weighed. Thereafter, 0.2 ml of Protosol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected through the rubber stopper into the center well, and the medium was acidified by injection of 0.5 ml of 15% perchloric acid. Liberated CO2 was collected for 60 min, and center wells were transferred to vials for liquid scintillation counting. Results were expressed as mmol of oxidized glucose/g of wet weight/h. The rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined by accumulation of 14C into glycogen. The muscles were homogenized in 500 μl of 1 m NaOH and subsequently neutralized with 500 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3500 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Glycogen of the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 200 μl of 110 mm glycogen and 2 ml of 95% ethanol. The glycogen precipitate was collected after centrifugation (2000 × g for 15 min) and dissolved in water for liquid scintillation counting. For the measurement of lactate release, nonradiolabeled glucose was used. After 60 min of incubation with or without insulin, medium was collected, and the lactate concentration was measured by using a colorimetric lactate assay kit (Biomedical Research Service Center, University at Buffalo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oleate Oxidation—Muscles were trimmed of excess tendon and weighed before preincubation for 40 min in Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 5 mm HEPES, 3.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glucose, and 12 nm insulin. Muscles were then transferred to vials containing 1 ml of identical medium with the addition of 0.3 mm [1-14C]oleate (0.2 μCi/ml) and incubated for 60 min. Vials were sealed with a rubber stopper, which was fixed with a center well. Muscles were oxygenated for the first 15 min of the incubation period via a needle inserted through the stopper. Thereafter, the oxygen needle was removed to close the system. After 60 min, 0.2 ml of Solvable (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was injected through the rubber stopper into the center well, and 0.5 ml of 15% perchloric acid was injected into the medium. Released CO2 was collected for 60 min, and center wells were transferred to vials for liquid scintillation counting after the addition of 47 μl of 5 m HCl. Results are expressed as nmol of oxidized oleate/g of wet weight/h. Western Blot Analysis—Muscles were pulverized in microcentrifuge tubes over liquid nitrogen and homogenized by a motor-driven pestle in 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X 100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Homogenates were solubilized by end-over-end mixing at 4 °C for 60 min and subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C. Total protein was determined using a commercially available kit (Pierce), and proteins (50 μg) solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis was performed using the following antibodies against actin (Cell Signaling), aldolase (Biodesign, Saco, ME), HK2 (a kind gift from O. Pedersen, Steno Memorial Hospital, Gentofte, Denmark), PDK4 (Abgent, San Diego, CA), PGC1α (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), GAPDH, PPARα, and PPARδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase, succinate-ubiquinol oxidoreductase, ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase subunit II, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, and ATP synthase α subunit were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences among groups were determined by two-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant differences post hoc analysis. Differences between two groups were determined by unpaired Student's t test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Rate of Glucose Incorporation into Glycogen and Glucose Oxidation—The rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined in skeletal muscle from wild-type mice and MCK-CnA* mice. In wild-type mice, insulin increased the rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen 10.1- and 4.3-fold in EDL and soleus muscles, respectively (Fig. 1A). Under insulin-stimulated conditions, the rate of glucose incorporation into glycogen was 98 and 34% greater in EDL and soleus muscles from MCK-CnA* mice respectively, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Rates of glucose incorporation into glycogen of soleus muscles were not significantly different between wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice under the basal condition. Insulin increased the rate of glucose oxidation 2.1-fold in EDL muscles from wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). However, the effect of insulin on glucose oxidation was blunted in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice (Fig. 1B). The basal and insulin-stimulated rate of glucose oxidation was not significantly different between soleus muscles from wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice. Regulatory Genes of Glucose Metabolism—In EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice, mRNA abundance of Pfkm (42%), Aldoa (33%), and Gapdh (24%) was reduced compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 2). In contrast, mRNA abundance of Ldh and Pdk4 was increased 210 and 340%, respectively, compared with wild-type mice. Protein content of HK2 was increased 37% in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice, relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 3A). In contrast, protein content of aldolase and GAPDH was down-regulated in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice 59 and 45% compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3, B and C). Expression of activated calcineurin in EDL muscle increased PDK4 protein content 260% compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3D). No significant change was observed for protein content of these enzymes in soleus muscle between wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice.FIGURE 3Changes in protein content of enzymes of glucose metabolism in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice. Protein content of HK2 (A), aldolase (B), GAPDH (C), and PDK4 (D) in EDL and soleus muscle of wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice was determined by Western blot analysis (equal sample loading was confirmed by blotting for actin). Data are expressed as a percentage of EDL muscle from wild-type mice. Data are means ± S.E. for n = 5–6 muscles. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.005 compared with wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Rate of Oleate Oxidation and Lactate Release—Rate of lipid oxidation was determined in skeletal muscle from wild-type and MCK-CnA* mice. Oleate oxidation was 41% greater in EDL muscles of MCK-CnA* mice compared with wild-type mice under the insulin-stimulated condition (Fig. 4A), consistent with our previous finding of elevated basal oleate oxidation in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice (17Ryder J.W. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44298-44304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Insulin increased the rate of lactate release in EDL muscles from wild-type mice 280% (Fig. 4B). The basal and insulin-stimulated rate of lactate release was increased in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice 310 and 156% respectively, compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4B). No significant further increase in lactate release was observed in soleus muscle from MCK-CnA* mice, relative to wild-type mice. Regulatory Genes of Lipid and Mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation—Expression of activated calcineurin in EDL skeletal muscle induced a consistent increase in the mRNA level of regulatory genes for lipid metabolism. The mRNA level of Lpl and Cd36 (genes involved in transport of lipid into the myofiber) was elevated 185 and 116%, respectively, in MCK-CnA* mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 5). Genes essential for transport of acyl-CoA into the mitochondria, including Cpt1 (65%), Cpt2 (127%), and Slc25a20 (89%), were up-regulated in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice, compared with wild-type mice. The mRNA abundance of mitochondrial enzymes involved in oxidation of fatty acid, including Decr1 (113%), Acadvl (77%), Hadhsc (62%), and Cs (24%), were also augmented in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice compared with wild-type mice. Expression of activated calcineurin induced a marked increase in protein content of mitochondrial proteins for oxidative phosphorylation in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice relative to wild-type mice, including NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase (193%), succinate-ubiquinol oxidoreductase (27%), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase subunit II (135%), cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (216%), and ATP synthase α subunit (71%) (Table 1, Fig. 6). There was no further increase in the protein expression of these genes in soleus muscle of MCK-CnA* mice.TABLE 1Protein content of enzymes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylationWild typeMCK-CnA*p value%%NADH-ubiquinol oxidoreductase EDL100 ± 17293 ± 24p < 0.005 Soleus351 ± 20341 ± 14NSSuccinate-ubiquinol oxidoreductase EDL100 ± 6127 ± 11p < 0.05 Soleus131 ± 8123 ± 7NSUbiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase subunit II EDL100 ± 4235 ± 12p < 0.005 Soleus254 ± 7250 ± 18NSCytochrome c oxidase subunit I EDL100 ± 10316 ± 34p < 0.005 Soleus424 ± 56339 ± 24NSATP synthase α subunit EDL100 ± 22171 ± 21p < 0.05 Soleus176 ± 22179 ± 14NS Open table in a new tab Induction of Transcription Factor and Co-activator by Calcineurin—Protein content of PPARα (160%) and PPARδ (90%) was increased in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice, relative to wild-type mice (Fig. 7). Consistent with our previous finding (17Ryder J.W. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44298-44304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), protein content of PGC1α was also increased 191% in EDL muscle from MCK-CnA* mice, compared with the wild-type mice. Comparable levels of protein content were observed in soleus muscle of MCK-CnA* and wild-type mice. Our results provide evidence that expression of activated calcineurin in fast glycolytic skeletal muscle induces a marked shift in glucose and lipid metabolism. Moreover, insulin-induced glucose oxidation was suppressed, concomitant with a coordinated decrease in the expression of glycolytic enzymes (PFKM, aldolase, and GAPDH) and an increase in the expression of LDH and PDK4, a potent inhibitory enzyme for glucose oxidation (20Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E855-E862Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The decrease in glucose oxidation was accompanied by a striking increase in insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen. This is consistent with our previous report of increased expression of Glut4 and glycogen synthase (17Ryder J.W. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44298-44304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and our current finding of increased HK2 expression. Therefore, expression of activated calcineurin in skeletal muscle reduces the partitioning of glucose for oxidation but increases glucose sparing for glycogen synthesis (supplemental Fig. S1). These calcineurin-regulated metabolic changes are partly mediated by coordinated changes in gene expression. Lipid oxidation in EDL muscles from MCK-CnA* mice under the insulin-stimulated condition was elevated compared with wild-type mice, consistent with our previous report of increased basal lipid oxidation (17Ryder J.W. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Zierath J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44298-44304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The enhanced capacity for lipid oxidation and increased expression of PDK4 markedly increased lactate release from EDL muscle of MCK-CnA* mice under basal and insulin-stimulated conditions, further supporting decreased entry of glucose into the Krebs cycle. Therefore, expression of activated calcineurin induced a shift in substrate metabolism from glucose utilization to lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle. The enhancement of lipid oxidation in EDL muscle of MCK-CnA* mice is supported by a consistent increase in the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The expression of Lpl and Cd36, two genes required for the uptake of lipid from extracellular space into the myofiber was up-regulated in EDL muscle of the transgenic mice. The entry of lipid-derived acyl-CoA into the mitochondrial is facilitated by multiple genes, including Cpt1, Cpt2, and Slc25a20, and expression of activated calcineurin increased the mRNA level of these genes in support of lipid utilization. Furthermore, several genes essential for β-oxidation, namely Decr1, Acadvl, and Hadhsc were also up-regulated in skeletal muscle harboring activated calcineurin. In cultured primary cardiac myocytes, activation of calcineurin induces the afore-mentioned lipid metabolic genes (21Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Magee C.J. Neilson J.R. Leone T.C. Chen F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39593-39603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), further underlining the role of calcineurin in the regulation of lipid metabolic gene expression. Therefore, activated calcineurin is sufficient to increase the transcription of multiple enzymes important for lipid metabolism to achieve a profound up-regulation of skeletal muscle lipid oxidation. The expression of genes regulating lipid metabolism, including Lpl, Cd36, Cpt1, Cpt2, Acadvl, and Hadhsc, as well as Pdk4 are regulated by PPARα (22Mandard S. Muller M. Kersten S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 393-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increase in mRNA expression of these genes, expression of activated calcineurin in skeletal muscle markedly increased the in vivo expression of PPARα. Skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of PPARα in mice also promotes the expression of Cd36, Cpt2, Slc25a20, Decr1, Acadvl, Hadhsc, and Pdk4 (14Finck B.N. Bernal-Mizrachi C. Han D.H. Coleman T. Sambandam N. LaRiviere L.L. Holloszy J.O. Semenkovich C.F. Kelly D.P. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 133-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In cultured C2C12 myotubes and cardiac myocytes, expression of Pparα is directly induced by calcineurin via activation of the Pparα promoter (21Schaeffer P.J. Wende A.R. Magee C.J. Neilson J.R. Leone T.C. Chen F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39593-39603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that activated calcineurin induced the expression of PPARα, in support of lipid oxidation via consistent increase in lipid metabolic gene expression. In addition to PPARα, PPARδ has also been implicated as a transcription regulator of skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. Both PPAR subtypes have a redundant and compensatory function in the regulation of lipid oxidation and gene regulatory events (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). We therefore cannot exclude the role of PPARδ (apart from PPARα) in mediating the effects of calcineurin on lipid oxidation. The induction of lipid oxidation and metabolic genes in human and rat cultured myotubes observed in response to a selective PPARδ agonist is similar to the effects observed in response to a PPARα-selective agonist (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was no additive effect on lipid oxidation and gene expression when maximum doses of both agonists were used concurrently, suggesting that both PPARs might bind to the same response element within a particular promoter (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Moreover, starvation and exercise elicit an appropriate response on skeletal muscle Pdk4 and Ucp3 expression in PPARα knock-out mice. Given that the expression of skeletal muscle Pparδ is severalfold higher than Pparα, as well as the finding that there is functional similarity between these two transcription regulators, PPARδ has been proposed to compensate for the loss of PPARα in these mice (23Muoio D.M. MacLean P.S. Lang D.B. Li S. Houmard J.A. Way J.M. Winegar D.A. Corton J.C. Dohm G.L. Kraus W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26089-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Consistently, in vivo pharmacological activation of PPARδ increases lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle via induction of lipid metabolic genes, including Cpt1, Pdk4, and Ucp3 (24Tanaka T. Yamamoto J. Iwasaki S. Asaba H. Hamura H. Ikeda Y. Watanabe M. Magoori K. Ioka R.X. Tachibana K. Watanabe Y. Uchiyama Y. Sumi K. Iguchi H. Ito S. Doi T. Hamakubo T. Naito M. Auwerx J. Yanagisawa M. Kodama T. Sakai J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15924-15929Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), a response that is also achieved by activation of PPARα. Our results provide evidence for the role of both PPARα and -δ in calcineurin-induced skeletal muscle lipid oxidation and metabolic gene expression. NADH and FADH2 generated from β-oxidation are reoxidized via oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Our results show that expression of activated calcineurin is associated with increased lipid oxidation in skeletal muscle and a concomitant increase in protein content of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis is promoted by overexpression of either PGC1α or activated PPARδ. Overexpression of either PGC1α (15Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.-Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar) or activated PPARδ (16Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) in mouse skeletal muscle also induces the formation of slow oxidative fibers. In transfected cells, PGC1α coactivates the calcineurin-mediated activation of myoglobin and troponin I gene promoter, suggesting a synergistic effect of calcineurin and PGC1α on the activation of the slow oxidative gene expression program (15Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.-Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e101Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) are impaired. Transgenic or pharmacological approaches to activated PPARδ also increase mitochondrial gene expression, including Cpt1 and various Cox genes in skeletal muscle (16Wang Y.X. Zhang C.L. Yu R.T. Cho H.K. Nelson M.C. Bayuga-Ocampo C.R. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e294Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways that regulate the expression of these transcription factors and coactivator are largely unresolved. Our results support the hypothesis that calcineurin induces mitochondrial biogenesis via induction of PGC1α and PPARδ expression. Calcineurin has been proposed to play a role in the regulation of exercise-induced gene expression in human skeletal muscle (27Pilegaard H. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 851-858Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Norrbom J. Sundberg C.J. Ameln H. Kraus W.E. Jansson E. Gustafsson T. J. Appl.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Exercise activates skeletal muscle calcineurin and PGC1α expression (27Pilegaard H. Saltin B. Neufer P.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 546: 851-858Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Norrbom J. Sundberg C.J. Ameln H. Kraus W.E. Jansson E. Gustafsson T. J. Appl.

FASEB J. 2005; 19: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and this is correlated with mitochondrial biogenesis (29Garnier A. Fortin D. Zoll J. N′Guessan B. Mettauer B. Lampert E. Veksler V. Ventura-Clapier R. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of calcineurin by cyclosporin treatment in rats did not abolish exercise-induced mRNA expression of PGC1α and multiple mitochondrial genes (30Garcia-Roves P.M. Huss J. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E1172-E1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle is complex and likely to involve additional signaling pathways. For example, AMP-activated protein kinase and myogenin (a muscle-specific transcription factor) have also been proposed to mediate exercise-induced metabolic adaptations. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in mice by genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches induces a similar pattern of exercise-induced gene expression (31Long Y.C. Zierath J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1776-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 32Winder W.W. J. Appl.

In myogenin transgenic mice, there is a shift from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism, concomitant with increased mitochondrial proteins in skeletal muscle (37Hughes S.M. Chi M. M.-Y Lowry O.H. Gundersen K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Clearly, multiple signaling pathways and nuclear effectors are involved in the regulation of the metabolic gene expression program in skeletal muscle. Our results support the hypothesis that calcineurin regulates pathways controlling lipid and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle via coordinated changes in the expression of metabolic genes, as well as transcription regulators, including PPARα, PPARδ, and PGC1α. Furthermore, activation of calcineurin markedly induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, we provide evidence that activated calcineurin alters metabolic and mitochondrial gene expression as well as various transcription regulators, leading to profound alterations in skeletal muscle lipid and glucose metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2083913738,"Prostaglandins (PGs) derived from the enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenases (COXs) are potent lipid mediators involved in human physiology and pathophysiology. Structurally similar compounds, the isoprostanes (IsoPs), are generated from the free radical-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonic acid independent of COX. IsoPs exhibit significant bioactivity and play a role in the pathogenesis of diseases associated with oxidant injury. As one of the major PGs, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) is present in human urine in significant concentrations and is presumed to be derived from COX activity. We determined, however, that levels of putative PGF2α in urine cannot be suppressed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, suggesting that it is generated via another mechanism(s). An important difference between COX-derived PGF2α and the IsoPs is that the former is an optically pure compound, whereas IsoPs are racemic. Utilizing a rodent model of oxidative stress, we now show that significant amounts of compounds identical in all respects to PGF2α and its enantiomer, ent-PGF2α, are formed in equal amounts esterified in tissue phospholipids, suggesting that these compounds are derived via the IsoP pathway. Further, employing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, the vast majority of putative PGF2α in human urine is derived from the free radical-initiated peroxidation of arachidonate independent of COX and is composed of PGF2α and its enantiomer, although the latter compound is ∼2-fold more abundant. Thus, quantification of urinary PGF2α actually reflects oxidative stress status as opposed to COX activity. Indeed, levels of this compound are elevated in urine from cigarette smokers and in humans with hypercholesterolemia, two conditions associated with oxidant stress. The elucidation that urinary PGF2α in humans is derived from the IsoP pathway has implications regarding PG formation and inhibition in vivo. Prostaglandins (PGs) derived from the enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenases (COXs) are potent lipid mediators involved in human physiology and pathophysiology. Structurally similar compounds, the isoprostanes (IsoPs), are generated from the free radical-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonic acid independent of COX.

Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, catalyze the formation of the reactive intermediate PGH2. This PG is then metabolized to the parent PGs, PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, or PGF2α by various PG synthases (2Marnett L.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). PGs exert a plethora of biological activities that regulate vascular tone, renal function, platelet aggregation, hypersensitivity, and inflammation. The formation, and thus biological activities of PGs, can be blocked by administration of various nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (3Dannhardt G. Kiefer W. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 36: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 4Grosser T. Fries S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Free radical-induced autoxidation is a second mechanism by which arachidonate can be oxidized in vivo. Nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation has been linked to numerous human disorders including atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases (5Steinberg D. Parhasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 7Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1283-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously, we determined that arachidonate is readily metabolized in vivo via free radical-initiated peroxidation to yield a series of PGF2-like compounds termed F2-IsoPs. These compounds possess potent bioactivity, and their quantification represents the most reliable index of oxidant stress in vivo (8Morrow J.D. Hill E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts Jr., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of F2-IsoPs have been observed in a number of human diseases that have been linked to oxidative stress, such as atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders (6Morrow J.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 7Montine T.J. Morrow J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 2005; 166: 1283-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A novel aspect of the formation of IsoPs is that, unlike cyclooxygenase-derived PGs, they are generated in situ esterified to phospholipids and released by phospholipases (9Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The formation of F2-IsoPs results in the generation of four regioisomers that contain 16 stereoisomers within each regioisomeric group (10Yin H. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3766-3776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, unlike COX, which generates stereoisomerically pure eicosanoids, IsoPs are formed as racemic diastereomers (12Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Gao L. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16720-16725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although the generation of lipid mediators derived from either COX-mediated or free radical-mediated mechanisms is believed to represent two distinct and separate pathways, levels of both classes of compounds are increased in many human diseases including atherosclerosis. In addition, there is cross-talk between the two pathways. The COXs have been implicated in IsoP formation because COX can generate reactive oxygen species that can oxidize arachidonate nonenzymatically. Further, certain lipid oxidation products such as lipid hydroperoxides generated from free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation can activate the COXs (13Basu S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PGF2α exerts a wide variety of biological activities and is a potent constrictor of smooth muscle in various organs and vasculature (15Smyth E.M. Burke A. Fitzgerald G.A. Brunton L.L. Lazo J.S. Parker K.L. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Theraperutics. 11th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2006: 653-670Google Scholar). It has been noted previously that human urine contains large amounts of PGF2α when analyzed by immunoassay and mass spectrometry (MS). It has been assumed that in human urine, PGF2α is derived from the COX pathway (16Froelich J.C. Wilson T.W. Sweetman B.J. Smigel M. Nies A.S. Carr K. Watson J.T. Oates J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1975; 55: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17Schweer H. Watzer B. Seyberth H.W. Nusing R.M. J.

Chem. 1997; 69: 2143-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, however, we determined that unlike other PGs, levels of this compound could not be suppressed in humans by NSAIDs, suggesting that this compound was generated independently of COX. Herein, we report studies to clarify the origin of this compound in human urine. As noted above, the generation of PGF2α via the COX results in the formation of a single stereoisomer, whereas that formed via the IsoP pathway consists of PGF2α and ent-PGF2α. Utilizing an animal model of oxidative stress and human clinical studies, we have determined that that urinary PGF2α is derived largely, if not entirely, via the IsoP pathway and not from COX. The elucidation that urinary PGF2α in humans is formed via the IsoP pathway has significant implications regarding PG formation and inhibition in diseases associated with oxidative stress including atherosclerosis. Reagents and Animals—Lipids were purchased from Nu Chek Prep (Elysian, MI) and were of the highest purity (>99+%). PGF2α, [2H4]PGF2α, and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Human recombinant 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) was partially purified by blue agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (19Ding Y. Tong M. Liu S. Moscow J.A. Tai H.-H. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The standard ent-PGF2α was prepared from ent-PGE2 by sodium boron hydride reduction and separated from the 1,3-trans-diols on the cyclopentane ring by HPLC (20Taber D.F. Jiang Q. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 5991-5994Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Compound structure was confirmed by various mass spectrometric and chemical approaches and compared with commercially available (Cayman Chemical) chemically pure ent-PGF2α. Oxidation of lipids in Vitro—Phospholipids were oxidized as a thin film under atmospheric oxygen at 37 °C for 24 h as described (30Kadiiska M.B. Gladen B.C. Baird D.D. Germolec D. Graham L.B. Parker C.E. Nyska A. Wachsman J.T. Ames B.N. Basu S. Brot N. FitzGerald G.A. Floyd R.A. George M. Heinecke J.W. Hatch G.E. Hensley K. Lawson J.A. Marnett L.J. Morrow J.D. Murray D.M. Plastaras J.

Med. 2005; 38: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Lipid autoxidation mixtures were reduced with triphenylphosphine and hydrolyzed with methanolic KOH or phospholipase A2 prior to analysis. Other arachidonate oxidation mixtures were obtained using 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid as a precursor. 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid was generated using soybean 15-lipoxygenase as described (21Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Extraction of Esterified IsoPs from the Rat Liver—The extraction and hydrolysis of IsoPs from livers of rats treated with CCl4 was performed as reported previously (22Gao L. Zackert W.E. Hasford J.J. Danekis M.E. Milne G.L. Remmert C. Reese J. Yin H. Tai H.H. Dey S.K. Porter N.A. Morrow J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28479-28489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). IsoPs were then purified by C18 and Si Sep-Pak extraction. The mixture was reconstituted in the liquid chromatography (LC) mobile phase for LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS analysis as IsoP-free acids. For atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)-MS analysis, IsoP-free acids were esterified to the pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) ester followed by TLC separation. For gas chromatography (GC)/MS analysis, the PFB ester was further derivatized to trimethylsilyl derivatives. Urine Sample Preparation—An internal standard of [2H4]PGF2α (1.0 ng) in ethyl alcohol was added to 1 ml of urine, and the mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. The urine sample was purified by the Sep-Pak methods above. APCI-MS was carried out using PFB esters, and GC-MS analysis was done using PFB and trimethylsilyl derivatives. The levels of F2-IsoPs and PGs were expressed as ng per mg of creatinine. In some studies, either larger amounts of urine were analyzed for PGF2α or urine was also quantified for the major urinary metabolites of thromboxane, prostacyclin, or PGE2 as described (23Murphey L.J. Williams M.K. Sanchez S.C. Byrne L.M. Csiki I. Oates J.A. Johnson D.H. Morrow J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). LC-MS Analysis of F2-IsoPs and PGs—PFB esters of F2-IsoPs were analyzed by normal phase HPLC using 12% isopropyl alcohol in hexanes. Chiral LC separation was carried out on a ChiralPak AD column (25 × 0.46 cm, Chiral Technologies, Exton, PA) with 7% ethyl alcohol and 7% isopropyl alcohol in hexane. For reverse phase HPLC, a Phenomenex Luna ODS 5μ 2.1 mm x 25 cm column (Torrence, CA) was utilized at 0.2 ml/min flow rate with a gradient starting with 80% solvent A (2.0 mm NH4Ac) and 20% solvent B (5:95, MeOH:CH3CN), holding for 2 min and increasing to 65% B in 30 min and holding for 10 min. LC/MS was carried out using a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum 1.0 SR 1 mass spectrometer in negative ion mode. The instrument conditions were reported previously (20Taber D.F. Jiang Q. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 5991-5994Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Xcaliber software, version 1.3. 15-PGDH Assay—15-PGDH activity was determined by following the formation of NADH fluorometrically as described previously (19Ding Y. Tong M. Liu S. Moscow J.A. Tai H.-H. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Clinical Studies—All volunteers in clinical studies gave written informed consent, and the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved all studies. Human protocols utilizing the administration of ibuprofen (800 mg orally four times daily for 4 days) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were reported previously (14McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Murphey L.J. Williams M.K. Sanchez S.C. Byrne L.M. Csiki I. Oates J.A. Johnson D.H. Morrow J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 334: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Urine was collected for 24 h before and during treatment. In these studies, platelet thromboxane production was also measured in serum ex vivo as described (14McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For studies utilizing LPS, 11 male and 11 female volunteers, hospitalized at Vanderbilt University, received a bolus injection of 2 ng/kg of reference Escherichia coli endotoxin purified LPS (U. S. Reference E. coli endotoxin lot E.C.-5) with a specific activity of 5 units/ng. The protocol for cigarette smoking was published previously (24McAdam B.F. Byrne D. Morrow J.D. Oates J.A. Circulation. 2005; 112: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Morrow J.D. Frei B. Longmire A.W. Gaziano J.M. Lynch S.M. Shyr Y. Strauss W.E. Oates J.A. Roberts L.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Four male and four female smokers were selected who were consuming at least a pack (20 cigarettes) per day. 24-hour urine samples were measured for urinary PGF2α. Urine samples were also analyzed from eight hypercholesterolemia patients (total cholesterol >200 mg/dl). Importantly, for these studies, several experiments were performed to show that PGF2α was stable during the 24-h urine collection. First, levels of endogenous PGF2α did not vary significantly when human urine samples were incubated at room temperature for up to 5 days. Secondly, when synthetic PGF2α (5 ng/ml) was added to urine and incubated at room temperature for 24 h, measured recovery was 98 + 7% when quantified by mass spectrometry (n = 5). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. The IsoP Pathway Generates Racemic Mixtures of F2-IsoPs with Structures Identical to PGF2α and ent-PGF2α in Vitro and in Vivo—Free radical-induced autoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been associated with numerous human disorders, including atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases (1Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 26Chisolm G.M. Steinberg D. Free Radic. Biol.

Annals Neurol. 1998; 44: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). F2-IsoPs are one of the major oxidation products of arachidonic acid generated in vitro and in vivo. We have previously proposed a unified mechanism to explain the formation of these compounds (Fig. 1). According to this mechanism, four regioisomers can be generated from the oxidation of arachidonic acid (29Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Among these four possible regioisomers, 5- and 15-series compounds are formed in significantly greater amounts than 8- and 12-series molecules (10Yin H. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3766-3776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Within each regioisomeric group, eight racemic diastereomers are generated. Previous studies have shown that diastereomers with cis-alkyl side chains are produced in greater amounts when compared with those with trans-side chains although the latter are readily detectable (11O'Connor D.E. Mihelich E.D. Coleman M.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 3577-3584Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We developed an LC-MS method to study the regioisomeric and diasteromeric distribution of F2-IsoP from the in vitro oxidation mixture of the arachidonic acid-containing phospholipid 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (SAPC), which is the biologically relevant form of this fatty acid. The results are shown in Fig. 2A. The 5- and 15-series of F2-IsoPs are indeed formed in much greater amounts than those of 8- and 12-series. Interestingly, however, a peak in the 15-series IsoP chromatogram that co-elutes with PGF2α is readily detectable, although it is not the major diastereomeric product. Total quantities of F2-IsoPs generated are 500 ± 30 ng/mg of SAPC. Of these, material co-eluting with PGF2α is ∼10% of the total F2-IsoPs.FIGURE 2LC-MS analysis of F2-IsoPs derived from SAPC oxidation in vitro (A-C) and from the oxidation of rat liver phospholipids in vivo (D and E).

Subsequently, this material was subjected to chiral LC, and two peaks with nearly equal amounts are present (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the first perfectly co-elutes with chemically synthesized ent-PGF2α and the latter with PGF2α. These two peaks were then collected and derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers; GC-MS analysis showed that these two enantiomers have exactly the same retention time as that of a PGF2α standard (data not shown). These experimental results support the contention that free radical-mediated peroxidation of phospholipid-bound arachidonate generates racemic mixture of isoprostanes, and the isomer with structures identical to PGF2α is formed in significant amounts. We next sought to determine the extent to which PGF2α and ent-PGF2α are generated in vivo esterified to phospholipids. For these studies, oxidant stress was induced in rats by the intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (30Kadiiska M.B. Gladen B.C. Baird D.D. Germolec D. Graham L.B. Parker C.E. Nyska A. Wachsman J.T. Ames B.N. Basu S. Brot N. FitzGerald G.A. Floyd R.A. George M. Heinecke J.W. Hatch G.E. Hensley K. Lawson J.A. Marnett L.J. Morrow J.D. Murray D.M. Plastaras J. Roberts II, L.J. Rokach J. Shigenaga M.K. Sohal R.S. Sun J. Tice R.R. Thiel D.H. Wellner D. Walter P.B. Tome K.B. Mason R.P. Barrett J.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Esterified F2-IsoPs in liver tissue were analyzed using the same approaches as noted for the in vitro oxidation above. A virtually identical pattern of F2-IsoP regioisomers was observed as in the in vitro oxidation of arachidonyl-containing phospholipids (Fig. 2D). The total amount of F2-IsoPs generated is ∼630 ± 50 ng/g of liver tissue, and material co-eluting with PGF2α represents ∼5-10% of the total. When material co-eluting with PGF2α was then analyzed by chiral LC, two peaks were obtained representing a racemic mixture of equal amounts of PGF2α and ent-PGF2α (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that similar to the generation of PGF2α and ent-PGF2α in vitro, racemic PGF2α can be formed in vivo from the peroxidation of arachidonate esterified in tissue phospholipids. Human Urine Contains PGF2α and ent-PGF2α—Having found that significant amounts of PGF2α are formed in vitro and in vivo esterified to phospholipids via the IsoP pathway, we next sought to determine whether PGF2α present in human urine is enantiomerically pure or consists of a mixture of PGF2α and ent-PGF2α. This determination is of significance since it is generally assumed that PGF2α is exclusively derived in vivo via COX (16Froelich J.C. Wilson T.W. Sweetman B.J. Smigel M. Nies A.S. Carr K. Watson J.T. Oates J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1975; 55: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 17Schweer H. Watzer B. Seyberth H.W. Nusing R.M. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, urine was obtained from healthy volunteers, and material representing putative PGF2α, as well as F2-IsoPs, was subjected to purification and analysis by LC/MS. The results are shown in Fig. 3. The pattern of F2-IsoPs found in human urine is different from that observed in phospholipids from an in vitro oxidation or from liver extract from rats after CCl4 treatment primarily because of the different relative abundance of IsoP isomers. Interestingly, material representing putative PGF2α is one of the major 15-series IsoP peaks in human urine (Fig. 3A). Material co-eluting with PGF2α was then purified (Fig. 3B) and subjected to chiral LC analysis (Fig. 3C). The first peak in the upper chromatogram of Fig. 3C perfectly co-elutes with ent-PGF2α, and the second perfectly co-elutes with PGF2α. CID experiments were carried out on the two enantiomers, and identical spectra were obtained and were essentially the same as that of chemically pure PGF2α (Fig. 3D). In addition, using various chemical approaches, these compounds were found to have three hydroxyls and two double bonds consistent with their structure as PGs containing F-type prostane rings (8Morrow J.D.

Interestingly, there is significantly more ent-PGF2α (0.62 ng/mg of creatinine) than PGF2α (0.39 ng/mg of creatinine) present in urine from this human. Although PGF2α in human urine is not racemic as observed when analyzed from liver phospholipids extracts, these results suggest that the vast majority of material co-eluting with PGF2α is likely derived from the IsoP pathway because ent-PGF2α can only be generated via the IsoP pathway. The reason(s) that levels of ent-PGF2α are significantly greater than PGF2α is not readily apparent. One might predict that levels of PGF2α would exceed those of ent-PGF2α because of the fact that the former compound can be generated not only via the IsoP pathway but also via COX. One potential explanation for our observations, however, is that PGF2α is preferentially metabolized in vivo when compared with ent-PGF2α. It is proposed that urinary PGF2α is derived from production in tissues such as the kidney and is excreted into the urine (16Froelich J.C. Wilson T.W. Sweetman B.J. Smigel M. Nies A.S. Carr K.

Med. 1986; 81: 23-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to excretion of parent PGs, eicosanoids, including PGF2α, are extensively metabolized, and the metabolites are also excreted into urine. The metabolism of PGF2α has been well studied, and several enzymes have been shown to be involved in its catabolism. The first and key regulatory step in this metabolic pathway is the oxidation of 15-hydroxyl group of PGF2α to a ketone by 15-PGDH (32Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7470-7485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Granstrom E. Samuelsson B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969; 91: 3398-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of 15-PGDH to metabolize PGF2α and ent-PGF2α in vitro using the recombinant human enzyme. Interestingly, we found that PGF2α, as reported previously, is a substrate for this enzyme with a Vmax = 11.61 ± 0.79 μm/min/μg of protein and Km = 12.76 ± 3.2 μm but that 15-PGDH did not metabolize ent-PGF2α. These results are consistent with the notion that there is more ent-PGF2α in human urine than PGF2α due to the fact that PGF2α is readily metabolized, whereas the enantiomer is not. To provide further evidence for this hypothesis, we also examined the optical purity of the initial metabolite of PGF2α generated in vivo, 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α, in human urine and plasma. Again, our result support the notion that PGF2α, but not ent-PGF2α, is a substrate for 15-PGDH since 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGF2α in human urine and plasma is an opti"

We have identified PCA1 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an overexpression suppressor of copper toxicity. PCA1 possesses signatures of a P1B-type heavy metal-transporting ATPase that is widely distributed from bacteria to humans. Copper resistance conferred by PCA1 is not dependent on catalytic activity, but it appears that a cysteine-rich region located in the N terminus sequesters copper. Unexpectedly, when compared with two independent natural isolates and an industrial S. cerevisiae strain, the PCA1 allele of the common laboratory strains we have examined possesses a missense mutation in a predicted ATP-binding residue conserved in P1B-type ATPases. Consistent with a previous report that identifies an equivalent mutation in a copper-transporting P1B-type ATPase of a Wilson disease patient, the PCA1 allele found in laboratory yeast strains is nonfunctional. Overexpression or deletion of the functional allele in yeast demonstrates that PCA1 is a cadmium efflux pump. Cadmium as well as copper and silver, but not other metals examined, dramatically increase PCA1 protein expression through post-transcriptional regulation and promote subcellular localization to the plasma membrane. Our study has revealed a novel metal detoxification mechanism in yeast mediated by a P1B-type ATPase that is unique in structure, substrate specificity, and mode of regulation.

One of the cDNAs identified encodes the putative P1B-type ATPase, PCA1, which has been suggested to be involved in copper and/or iron homeostasis (37Rad M.R. Kirchrath L. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1994; 9: 1217-1225Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38De Freitas J.M. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Su T. Wintz H. Fox T. Holman P. Loguinov A. Keles S. van der Laan M. Vulpe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4450-4458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previously, the cadmium resistance of a mutant yeast strain selected on toxic concentrations of cadmium was mapped to the PCA1 gene that contained multiple mutations (39Shiraishi E. Inouhe M. Joho M. Tohoyama H. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the role and mechanisms of action of PCA1 in metal metabolism have remained elusive. Here we show that PCA1-mediated copper resistance is dependent on its Cys-rich N-terminal domain. The PCA1 allele in all laboratory yeast strains examined carries a missense mutation in a conserved residue resulting in loss of function. The wild-type PCA1 allele confers cadmium resistance by an efflux mechanism accompanied by a novel mode of metal-dependent post-transcriptional regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains, Media, and Phenotypic Tests—Strain BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and null mutants ace1Δ::KanMX6, pca1Δ::KanMX6 were purchased from Open Biosystems. Strain RM11-1a (40Brem R.B. Yvert R. Clinton R. Kruglyak L. Science. 2002; 296: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) (MATa leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 HO::KanMX6) was kindly provided by Leonid Kruglyak (Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). RM11-1a pca1Δ::URA3 and BY4741 ace1Δ::KanMX6 Δpca1:HIS3 were generated by PCR-based homologous recombination (41Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Phillippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4108) Google Scholar). For consistency and simultaneous comparisons of copper and cadmium sensitivity, all experiments unless indicated otherwise were performed using the BY4741 ace1Δ strain. Plasmids were transformed into yeast using the lithium acetate procedure (42Geitz D.R. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown on synthetic complete (SC) media (2% dextrose or galactose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, and 0.2% dropout mixture for plasmid selection). For phenotypical analysis, ∼5 μl of yeast cells (A600 1.0) were spotted on selective media (1.5% agar) supplemented with the indicated concentrations of cadmium (CdCl2) or copper (CuCl2) (Sigma) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days.Selection of cDNAs Conferring Copper Resistance—Strain BY4741 ace1Δ strain was transformed with a yeast cDNA library (43Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants (∼1 × 106 colonies) growing on SC-Ura media were collected by resuspending in sterilized distilled water, diluted, and plated on galactose-containing SC-Ura media supplemented with copper (0.1 mm CuCl2). Plasmids containing cDNA were isolated from yeast colonies growing on selection media and identified by sequencing. cDNA-dependent copper resistance was confirmed by retransformation of the isolated plasmid into ace1Δ yeast cells.Plasmid Construction—The PCA1 open reading frame (ORF) was PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of a single-copy yeast expression vector for GPD (p413 GPD) (44Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar) or GAL1 (p413 GAL1) (45Johnston M. Davis R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) gene promoter-mediated expression. The coding sequences of the PCA1 N-terminal domains (amino acids 1–392 and 1–452) were PCR-amplified with a primer set containing a start codon and an artificially generated stop codon and were subcloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of p413-GPD. The PCA1 truncation mutant (amino acids 393–1216) was generated by PCR amplification of the sequences, including start and stop codons, and was subcloned into p413 GPD at BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. PCA1-GFP and PCA1-FLAG were constructed by generation of a NotI restriction site after the start codon for insertion of NotI-flanked green fluorescent protein (GFP) without start and stop codons or two tandem FLAG epitopes, respectively. For natural promoter-driven expression, the PCA1 ORF, including 810 bp upstream of the start position, was cloned into SacI and XhoI restriction sites of plasmid pRS413 (46Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted by the primer overlap extension method (47Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells were transformed with PCA1-GFP or PCA1-WT-GFP expression plasmids and cultured in SC-His media at 30 °C with agitation until mid-log phase. Metals were added to the culture media for 15 min to 2 h prior to imaging. Cells were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and imaged on a confocal microscope (Olympus FV500).Metal Measurements—Yeast cells were cultured until mid-log phase, and metal ions were added to the culture media for 6 h. Cells were collected in 2-ml aliquots and washed two times in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were dissolved in 70% nitric acid at 60 °C for 30 min and diluted to 10% nitric acid. To measure cadmium excretion, cells were cultured with 5 mm CdCl2 for 30 min, washed two times in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA, and resuspended in fresh media prior to sample collection at the indicated time points. Total cellular metal levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) at the Department of Geological Sciences, University of Michigan.Immunoblotting—Total protein extracts were prepared from yeast cells using glass beads and Triton X-100 (1%) as described previously (48Pena M.M. Puig S. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33244-33251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the BCA method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Protein samples were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. PCA1-GFP was detected by chemiluminescence using a primary rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCA1-FLAG was probed with primary mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (Sigma) and secondary sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) (1:5000). Loading control, phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), was detected by chemiluminescence using mouse monoclonal anti-PGK antibodies (1:4000) (Molecular Probes) and secondary sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences).Northern Blotting—Yeast cells were cultured until mid-log phase and supplemented with either 50 μm CdCl2 or 50 μm CuCl2 for 15 and 60 min. Total RNA was extracted from cells, and 25 μg was separated on an RNA gel (0.75% agarose and 2% formaldehyde) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran). Gene-specific DNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) were generated using the random primer labeling system (Invitrogen). Hybridization of radiolabeled probes with RNA transcripts was performed by methods described previously (49Lee J. Petris M.J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40253-40259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Relative mRNA levels were detected by autoradiography.RESULTSPCA1 N-terminal Domain Confers Copper Resistance in Yeast—To identify new factors involved in heavy metal defense, we carried out a selection of S. cerevisiae cDNAs that suppress lethality of the ace1Δ yeast strain on toxic copper media. A cDNA encoding PCA1, one of two P1B-type ATPases in the S. cerevisiae genome (37Rad M.R. Kirchrath L. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1994; 9: 1217-1225Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 50Yuan D.S.

Yeast GPD gene promoter-driven constitutive expression of PCA1 confers resistance in the ace1Δ strain to copper (0.1 mm CuCl2) compared with empty vector transformed control cells (Fig. 1A). Deletion of PCA1 in the ace1Δ strain resulted in a slight increase in sensitivity to copper toxicity (Fig. 1A). However, in a wild-type strain, copper resistance was not easily discernible upon either overexpression or deletion of PCA1 (data not shown).PCA1 contains all of the conserved features of the P1B-type ATPase family, which is specific for heavy metal transport (16Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 17Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. Plant.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). These features include eight predicted transmembrane domains, where an intramembranous metal-transporting CPX motif is located in the sixth transmembrane domain (Fig. 1B). The catalytic domains reside within cytosolic loops that include the nucleotide binding domain (N-domain) and the phosphorylation domain (P-domain) (Fig. 1B). PCA1 contains a single CXXC heavy metal-binding motif located within the N-terminal region. An intriguing feature of PCA1 compared with other P1B-type ATPases is a Cys-rich N-terminal extension ∼550 amino acids before the first transmembrane domain (Fig. 1B). To ascertain whether the observed copper resistance by PCA1 is dependent on ATPase function, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues of this family of proteins and assayed for copper sensitivity. However, copper resistance remained unchanged in all mutants (Fig. 1C), suggesting that copper resistance is not dependent on metal translocation. Given that the N terminus contains several cysteine residues (33 Cys), which could serve as copper ligands, we tested whether this domain could independently confer resistance. A peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 1–452, which includes the CXXC motif (Fig. 1B), was expressed in the ace1Δ strain. Expression of this peptide resulted in copper resistance above that of full-length PCA1, presumably by chelating copper ions in a manner analogous to MT (Fig. 1D). Copper resistance is maintained even after mutation of the conserved CXXC motif (C421A, C423A) (Fig. 1D) implying the existence of other copper coordination site(s) in addition to this well characterized metal-binding motif.Common Laboratory Yeast Strains Possess a G970R Mutation in PCA1—S288c is a commonly used S. cerevisiae haploid strain in which its entire genome has been sequenced (52Goffeau A. Barrell B.G. Bussey H. Davis R.W. Dujon B. Feldmann H. Galibert F. Hoheisel J.D. Jacq C. Johnson M. Louis E.J. Mewes H.W. Murakami Y. Philippsen P. Tettelin Oliver S.G. Science. 1996; 274: 563-567Crossref Scopus (3208) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the PCA1 sequence of S288c with natural isolates, RM11-1a (40Brem R.B. Yvert R. Clinton R. Kruglyak L. Science. 2002; 296: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar) and YJM789 (53Tawfik O.W. Papasian C.J. Dixon A.Y. Potter L.M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1989; 27: 1689-1691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using BLAST (NCBI, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) revealed that the S288c strain carries a single nucleotide change in the PCA1 gene, which results in a G970R substitution. (Fig. 2). Our sequencing results of PCA1 cloned from the RM11-1a strain as well as an industrial bakers' yeast strain (Fleischmann's) confirmed the G970R substitution. To determine whether this mutation was unique to the S288c strain, we sequenced the PCA1 ORF of several laboratory yeast strains, BY4741 (Open Biosystems), DTY1 (54Rymond B.C. Zitomer R.S. Schumperli D. Rosenberg M. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), EG103 (55Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J.

All contained the G970R mutation (data not shown), which suggests a common lineage among theses strains. Furthermore, sequence alignments of prokaryotic, yeast, plant, and human P1B-type ATPases show that this Gly residue is invariantly conserved among this family of proteins (Fig. 2). Recently, structural studies of the nucleotide binding domain (N-domain) of two P1B-type ATPases (CopA and ATP7b) places this Gly residue within an ATP-binding pocket (57Sazinsky M.H. Mandal A.K.

The functional importance of this residue is further underscored by an equivalent G1101R substitution in ATP7b previously reported in patients with Wilson disease (59Thomas G.R. Forbes J.R. Roberts E.A. Walshe J.M. Cox D.W. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Together, our data along with recent reports strongly support the conclusion that many laboratory S. cerevisiae strains contain a mutation of a critical residue in PCA1 that may play essential roles in function, expression, and/or regulation.FIGURE 2Yeast laboratory strains contain a G970R mutation in PCA1. A region of the predicted nucleotide binding domain (N-domain) of PCA1 from strains S288c, RM11-1a, and YJM789 were aligned with the corresponding region of other P1B-type ATPases, including human copper-transporting ATP7a and ATP7b, S. cerevisiae CCC2, A. thaliana HMA4, S. aureus CadA, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA. Boxes highlight conserved residues. Asterisk marks G970R substitution identified in the S288C and other laboratory S. cerevisiae strains.

Indeed, expression of PCA1-WT allows cells to grow on media containing a cadmium concentration over 10-fold higher compared with vector and PCA1 carrying the G970R mutation (Fig. 3A). However, growth on media supplemented with copper was indistinguishable, which is consistent for copper resistance being dependent on metal binding rather than ATPase activity (Fig. 3A). No growth advantages in cells expressing PCA1-WT were observed when toxic concentrations of zinc, manganese, cobalt, or iron were added to growth media (data not shown), suggesting specificity in metal binding and translocation by PCA1-WT.FIGURE 3PCA1 natural allele (PCA1-WT) plays a critical role in cadmium defense.

It is expressed as a 60-kDa inactive precursor that must undergo autocatalytic processing to generate a 40-kDa/20-kDa heterodimer with full γ-glutamyl amide bond hydrolase activity. The new N terminus of the processed enzyme, Thr-380, is the catalytic nucleophile in both the autoprocessing and enzymatic reactions, indicating that HpGT is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily.

The refined model contains two 40-kDa/20-kDa heterodimers in the asymmetric unit and has structural features comparable with other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases. Autoprocessing of HpGT leads to a large conformational change, with the loop preceding the catalytic Thr-380 moving >35 Å, thus relieving steric constraints that likely limit substrate binding. In addition, cleavage of the proenzyme results in the formation of a threonine-threonine dyad comprised of Thr-380 and a second conserved threonine residue, Thr-398. The hydroxyl group of Thr-398 is located equidistant from the α-amino group and hydroxyl side chain of Thr-380. Mutation of Thr-398 to an alanine results in an enzyme that is fully capable of autoprocessing but is devoid of enzymatic activity.

The γ-glutamyl group can be transferred to water (hydrolysis) or an amino acid or short peptide (transpeptidation) (1Tate S.S. Meister A. Mol. Cell.

The enzyme is located in the periplasmic space of the bacterium and has been shown to be a virulence factor in infection (6Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol.

Immun. 2001; 69: 4168-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the precise functions of HpGT in colonization and persistence have not been defined. γ-Glutamyltranspeptidases (γGT) are fairly ubiquitous, with homologues observed in all kingdoms. Distant γGT often share considerable sequence identity (e.g. bacterial versus mammalian enzymes are >20% identical), suggesting a strong conservation of structure and function. Despite considerable sequence homology, significant catalytic differences exist between bacterial and non-bacterial homologues. For example, human γGT is >100-fold more effective than HpGT at catalyzing transpeptidation, even though the two enzymes have comparable hydrolase activities (8Abbott W.A. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol.

Undoubtedly, structural variations in the enzyme active sites are responsible for these differences in substrate specificities. HpGT is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily (13Brannigan J.A. Dodson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 14Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases share a common core structure, undergo autoprocessing and activation, and catalyze amide bond hydrolysis, with the new N-terminal residue serving as a catalytic nucleophile in the enzymatic reaction. HpGT is synthesized as an inactive 60-kDa polypeptide. Intramolecular autocatalytic cleavage of the proenzyme results in a fully active heterodimer comprised of a 40-kDa and a 20-kDa subunit. The resultant N terminus, Thr-380, has been shown to be the catalytic nucleophile in both the autoprocessing and enzymatic reactions (6Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol.

However, the residues responsible for increasing the nucleophilicity of Thr-380 in either reaction have not been identified. This perfectly conserved threonine residue has been shown to be essential for processing in a number of γGT, including the enzymes isolated from Escherichia coli (15Hashimoto W. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this report, we have determined the crystal structure of recombinant H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase to 1.9 Å resolution using the recently reported E. coli enzyme structure (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as a molecular replacement probe. Examination of these structures in combination with molecular docking and homology modeling studies reveals mechanistic details of enzyme maturation and activation, substrate recognition, and catalysis. Based on this analysis, we have used kinetic and mutagenesis studies of H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidase to demonstrate that a threonine-threonine dyad is required for efficient hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl peptide bond of glutathione. Overexpression and Purification of HpGT—The expression and purification of HpGT have been described previously (6Chevalier C. Thiberge J.M. Ferrero R.L. Labigne A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pET28 plasmid containing the coding sequence for mature HpGT was used to transform E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Cultures, grown to an A600 of 0.6-0.8 in 2× YT medium containing 34 mg/liters chloramphenicol and 30 mg/liters kanamycin, were induced for 4 h by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 500 μm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. Thawed cells were lysed by sonication, nucleic acids were precipitated, and the mixture was cleared of particulates by centrifugation. Recombinant HpGT was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using a nickel-chelating column (Novagen). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of HpGT were grown at 18 °C by the sitting drop method out of a solution of 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, within the precipitant range of 16-25% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Crystals reached a final size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm in 1 to 2 weeks. To collect data at cryogenic temperatures, crystals were transferred to artificial mother liquor containing additional cryoprotectant (20Rodgers D.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1135-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This was accomplished in a stepwise fashion by soaking the crystals for 1-2 min in artificial mother liquor containing increasing amounts of polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether (5% increments) until a final concentration of 30% was attained. Diffraction data were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K) on Beamline 14-BM-C (λ = 0.9 Å) of BioCARS at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source and analyzed using the HKL2000 software package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure of HpGT was determined by molecular replacement using the Crystallography and NMR System software package (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as the search molecule. An unambiguous solution was obtained with an initial R of 47.1%, following rigid body refinement. The resulting phase information produced a readily interpretable electron density map. Model Building and Refinement—Multiple rounds of model building and refinement were performed using the programs (Crystallographic Object)-Oriented Toolkit (COOT; Ref. 23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (No. 1): 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and Crystallography and NMR System (CNS; Ref. 22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), respectively. An Rfree test set (10%) was maintained, and ambiguous regions of the electron density map were evaluated using 2Fo - Fc-simulated annealing omit maps. As the model neared completion, water molecules obeying proper hydrogen-bonding constraints with electron densities >1.0 σ on a 2Fo - Fc map and 3.0 σ on an Fo - Fc map were also included. Model geometry was monitored using MOLPROBITY (24Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar), and figures were generated using Chimera (25Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (29000) Google Scholar). Substrate Docking Studies and Homology Modeling of Human hGT—Coordinates for glutathione were obtained from HIC-Up (26Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54 (No. 1): 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and initially docked based on homology to the glutamate binding site identified in E. coli γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (EcGT; Ref. 19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interactions between glutathione and HpGT were manually optimized using COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (No. 1): 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and the final model subjected to global energy minimization in CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Several possible conformations of GSH were investigated, each with comparable van der Waals and electrostatic contacts, and one potential HpGT-ligand complex is presented. A homology model of human γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (hGT) was constructed based upon the structures of EcGT and HpGT. These three homologues share 21% sequence identity and an additional 19% sequence similarity (see supplemental materials) and very likely share a common structure. The core hGT structure was built by the automated server, 3D-Jigsaw (27Bates P.A. Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. Proteins. 2001; 5: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Questionable regions of the initial model were re-evaluated by visual inspection and comparison to both the E. coli and H. pylori structures. Manual model building was performed in many of the loop regions and subjected to local geometric regularization using COOT (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (No. 1): 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The resulting model, which excludes residues 1-36, 366-380, and 564-569, was then subjected to a global energy minimization in CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Kinetic Characterizations of HpGT Mutants—Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol, and all constructs were verified by sequencing (Genomics Core at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln). The cleavage of the precursor (60 kDa) to its mature form (20- and 40-kDa subunits) was assessed by SDS-PAGE (9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Percent processing values were determined by densitometric analysis of the gels using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad), plotted versus time, and fit to a first-order monoexponential curve using Prism (Graph Pad Software). Representative data from three or more determinations are presented with experimental errors determined from individual fits of the kinetic data. Hydrolysis of the substrate analogue, l-glutamic acid γ-(4-nitroanilide) (GNA; Sigma), was monitored using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm GNA, 25 °C). Apparent kinetic constants were determined by assaying enzymatic activity at various concentrations of GNA, ranging from 1 to 1000 μm (5Keillor J.W. Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Tate S.S. Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 400-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and the data were fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Structure Determination and Model Quality—X-ray diffraction data were collected on Beamline 14-BM-C of BioCARS and extended to 1.9 Å resolution with an Rsym = 4.6% (Table 1). The structure of HpGT was determined by molecular replacement using the related EcGT as a probe (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), with non-conserved residues replaced by alanine. An unambiguous solution was obtained, and inspection of the initial electron density map revealed numerous positive peaks corresponding to the omitted amino acid side chains. HpGT crystals belong to space group P21 and contain two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit. For the first heterodimer (subunits A and B), the model includes residues 29-375 of the 40-kDa subunit and residues 380-565 of the 20-kDa subunit. For the second heterodimer (subunits C and D), residues 31-379 of the 40-kDa subunit and residues 380-565 of the 20-kDa subunit were observed.

The 40- and the 20-kDa subunits of the enzyme are colored in purple and green, respectively. The two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit are nearly identical with a root mean square deviation of 0.39 Å for main chain atoms. The overall HpGT structure is comparable with that of the E. coli enzyme, which also contained two heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (root mean square deviation 0.95 Å; Fig. 1B). Interestingly, as in the E. coli structure, the C terminus of the 40-kDa subunit (Asn-379) is >35 Å from the N terminus of the 20-kDa subunit (Thr-380), suggesting that a significant conformational change accompanies autoprocessing. Previously we have shown that HpGT is a heterotetramer comprised of two 40- and two 20-kDa subunits (α2β2) both by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering (9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although two HpGT heterodimers are contained within the asymmetric unit, the buried surface area between them is only ∼1600 Å2. This significant, but not extensive, interaction could indicate that the heterotetramer is not the biologically relevant form. However, despite crystallizing in a different space group, EcGT has a nearly identical arrangement of heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), as does a P1 crystal form of HpGT. 4A. Sand and J. J. Barycki, unpublished observation. These observations suggest that crystal contacts alone are not responsible for the observed arrangement of heterodimers, and further studies of this potential interface are warranted. Substrate Binding Site of HpGT—HpGT was crystallized in the absence of substrates or inhibitors, and thus the active site was identified by comparison with the glutamate-bound form of the closely related EcGT (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glutathione, the presumed physiological substrate, was docked into the active site of HpGT by superimposing its γ-glutamyl group onto the corresponding atoms of the EcGT-bound glutamate. The modeled complex was then subjected to local and global energy minimization. Several potential orientations of the cysteinylglycine were observed, and a representative schematic is provided in Fig. 2. The glutamate binding site is inaccessible to solvent, whereas the remainder of the active site is surface exposed (Fig. 2A). Because the cysteinylglycine binding site is shallow and solvent accessible, direct binding contacts are minimal. This probably accounts for the ability of the enzyme to accommodate its diverse glutathione-conjugated substrates as well as numerous substrate analogues. In the model, the glutamate binding site is defined by nine hydrogen bonds with highly conserved residues predominantly in the 20-kDa subunit (Fig. 2B). The α-carboxylate of glutamate is coordinated directly and indirectly (via a bridging water molecule) by Arg-103, Ser-451, and Ser-452. The α-amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Asn-400, Glu-419, and Asp-422, with the negatively charged Glu-419 and Asp-422 likely balancing the positive charge of the α-amino group. Lastly, the γ-carbonyl can interact favorably with the backbone amide of Gly-472. Many of the corresponding residues in hGT have been implicated as active site residues by site-directed mutagenesis (10Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Anderson M.E. Taniguchi N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22223-22228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Ikeda Y. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12471-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In EcGT, a nearly identical arrangement of glutamate binding site residues is observed (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The only difference is the replacement of Glu-419 with a glutamine (Gln-430 in E. coli). This isosteric substitution suggests that the negative charge of Glu-419 is not required to counterbalance the presumed positive charge of the α-amino group of the γ-glutamyl portion of glutathione. Homology Modeling of hGT—We have shown that HpGT is a poor transpeptidase relative to mammalian homologues when using glycylglycine as the acceptor molecule (9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although human and H. pylori γ-glutamyltranspeptidases share ∼30% sequence identity and an additional 22% sequence similarity, HpGT has <1% of the transpeptidase activity of the human enzyme. To identify structural features that could account for the limited transpeptidase activity of the H. pylori enzyme, we have generated a homology model of hGT based on the two available bacterial structures, EcGT and HpGT (Fig. 3). The overall topology of the bacterial structures was maintained and side chain assignments were made based on the sequence alignment provided in supplemental materials. With these constraints, the model closely resembles the initial bacterial templates and has reasonable geometries. To validate the model, we evaluated the structure with respect to available biochemical data. As indicated above, previous mutagenesis studies with the human enzyme suggested that Arg-107, Glu-108, Asp-422, Asp-423, Ser-451, and Ser-452 were located at or near the enzyme active site (10Ikeda Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12471-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the human model, these residues largely comprise the glutamate binding site of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). Because these are active site residues, structural conservation is expected. However, the prediction of two disulfide bonds within the human enzyme in regions remote from the active site (Fig. 3A) but of demonstrated significance in the rat enzyme (18Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) further validates the hGT model. Hughey and coworkers (18Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown in rat γ-glutamyltranspeptidase that disulfides likely exist between Cys-49 and Cys-73 and between Cys-191 and Cys-195. In the human model, the equivalent residues (Cys-50/Cys-74 and Cys-192/Cys-196) are positioned optimally for disulfide bond formation. In contrast, neither HpGT nor EcGT contains a cysteine residue in the mature enzyme. A more extensive sequence comparison (see supplemental materials) indicates that the Cys-192/Cys-196 pair is only found in a subset of mammalian γ-glutamyltranspeptidases but the Cys-50/Cys-74 pair is highly conserved in non-bacterial homologues. Because the Cys-50/Cys-74 pair is remote from the active site, its high sequence conservation suggests a structural and/or regulatory function. In rat γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, the Cys-49/Cys-73 pair is required for maturation and cell surface expression of the enzyme, whereas the Cys-191/Cys-195 pair appears to be required for enhanced enzyme stability (18Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 426-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Examination of the human model indicates that the Cys-50/Cys-74 pair precedes a loop (residues 79-90; colored red in Fig. 3A) that contains a highly conserved Gly-Gly-Gly motif (residues 86-88 in hGT; see supplemental materials). Gly-88 and Leu-89 are within hydrogen bond distance of the peptide backbones of Thr-399 and Ala-106, respectively. As discussed below, Thr-399 is a critical active site residue, and Ala-106 precedes an active site arginine residue, Arg-107, that coordinates the α-carboxylate of the glutamyl portion of glutathione. Thus, the oxidation state of the Cys-50/Cys-74 dithiol/disulfide pair may influence the position of this active site loop and thus impact autoprocessing and enzymatic activities. Comparison of Human and H. pylori Active Sites—An inspection of the hGT model indicates that the glutamate binding site is very similar to that of the bacterial homologues. A minor difference is the conservative substitution of Tyr-433 in HpGT with a phenylalanine in hGT that is unlikely to affect glutamate binding significantly. Within the potential cysteinylglycine binding pocket, which is thought to be at least in part overlapping with the acceptor binding site for the transpeptidation reaction, there are several notable differences. Ala-78, Ala-79, Ala-401, and Ser-402 of HpGT are replaced by His-81, Ser-82, Leu-402, and Tyr-403, respectively. in hGT. These substitutions convert the rather open and non-polar binding pocket of HpGT to a more sterically constrained and polar site in the human enzyme and may account for the dramatic differences in donor and acceptor substrate specificities. Both Ser-82 and Tyr-403 are highly conserved in non-bacterial homologues (see supplemental materials) and may be important in recognition of the acceptor substrate during transpeptidation. Examination of the hGT model also suggests that the α-amino group of Thr-381 is the proposed general base that activates the acceptor (5Keillor J.W. Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 401: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Keillor J.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11504-11513Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) based on its proximity to the γ-carboxylate of glutamate. Because the α-amino group is conserved in all γGT and appears to have similar hydrogen bond networks as judged by modeling studies, the increased transpeptidase activity in mammalian homologues may be the result of more efficient acceptor binding relative to bacterial γGT. Activation of HpGT—HpGT must undergo autoprocessing in order to gain enzymatic activity, but the mechanism of activation has not been elucidated. Previous studies have shown that Thr-380 is the catalytic nucleophile in both the autoprocessing and hydrolysis reactions (9Boanca G. Sand A. Barycki J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19029-19037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For both processes, a general base mechanism has been proposed in which an adjacent residue would facilitate the attack of the threonine hydroxyl on the peptide bond (17Suzuki H. Kumagai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43536-43543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An examination of the HpGT structure suggests potential explanations for the necessity of autoprocessing. Both the HpGT and EcGT structures indicate that the C terminus of the 40-kDa subunit is a considerable distance from the conserved threonine residue at the N terminus of the 20-kDa subunit (Fig. 1B). In the unprocessed form of the enzyme, the mobile tail of the 40-kDa subunit would necessarily be positioned across the active site of the enzyme, possibly occluding the substrate binding site (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the proenzyme would relieve this steric constraint. In addition, autoprocessing leads to activation of Thr-380 for the hydrolysis reaction (Fig. 4). The new N terminus, the α-amino group of Thr-380, is within hydrogen bond distance of its own side chain hydroxyl as well as that of Thr-398. This second highly conserved threonine residue can form a hydrogen bond with the catalytic nucleophile, the hydroxyl group of Thr-380, thus forming a threonine-threonine dyad. A nearly identical orientation of active site residues is observed in mature EcGT, including the placement of the active site water (W3 in the EcGT structure). Contributions of Threonine 398 to Autoprocessing and Hydrolase Activities—To test whether Thr-398 is required for activation of Thr-380, site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed. Thr-398 was substituted with either an alanine (T398A) or a serine (T398S) residue, and autoprocessing and hydrolysis activities were measured (Fig. 5; Table 2). Both the T398A and the T398S mutants had processing rates comparable with wild-type HpGT, indicating that Thr-398 is not required for maturation. In contrast, the T398A mutant was devoid of hydrolase activity under standard assay conditions (Table 2). The T398S mutant retained considerable enzymatic activity but exhibited hydrolysis rates that were reduced ∼5-fold relative to wild-type enzyme and an overall catalytic efficiency, as measured by Vmax/Km, that was diminished by nearly an order of magnitude. Collectively, these results suggest that the γ-methyl group of Thr-398 may be necessary for optimal positioning of its side chain hydroxyl group. This hydroxyl, precisely positioned, is in turn required for activation of Thr-380 in the hydrolysis reaction but not in autoprocessing.TABLE 2Apparent kinetic constants for wild-type HpGT compared to Thr-398 mutantsEnzymeHydrolysisProcessing T½Km GNAVmaxμmμmol/min/mghoursHpGTaValues for wild-type HpGT were previously reported (9)12.5 ± 1.25.81 ± 0.131.73 ± 0.22T398S20.3 ± 1.91.14 ± 0.030.77 ± 0.07T398ANo activity2.34 ± 0.38a Values for wild-type HpGT were previously reported (9Boanca G.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2329-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that cleavage immediately before the N-terminal nucleophile allows its free α-amino group to serve as a general base, leading to the activation of its own side chain. Alternatively, self-processing may orient a general base that increases the nucleophilicity of the conserved catalytic residue. For isoaspartyl aminopeptidase (33Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and glycosylasparaginase (34Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a threonine hydroxyl group is found within hydrogen bond distance of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic nucleophile. Jaskolski and coworkers (33Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have proposed that this threonine-threonine side chain interaction would be preferable to the intramolecular activation of the catalytic nucleophile by its free α-amino group, citing that the N-terminal amino group is a weak hydrogen bond abstractor and easily protonated at neutral pH. Furthermore, an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the α-amino group and the side chain hydroxyl group would generate a five-membered ring with strained geometry (33Michalska K. Brzezinski K. Jaskolski M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28484-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the HpGT structure, the Thr-380 hydroxyl group is nearly equidistant from the α-amino of Thr-380 and the hydroxyl group of Thr-398. With the available data, we cannot unequivocally establish the identity of the base responsible for activation of the catalytic nucleophile. However, previous studies with rat γ-glutamyltranspeptidase have indicated that an imidazolium or primary ammonium ion with a perturbed pKa value is important in catalysis (35Menard A. Castonguay R. Lherbet C. Rivard C. Roupioz Y. Keillor J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12678-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Implications for Catalysis—Additional kinetic studies are required to establish the details of HpGT catalysis, particularly with regard to the identity of many of the proton donors/acceptors. However, using the available structural and biochemical data, a plausible HpGT mechanism can be described (Fig. 6). In the resting enzyme, the Thr-398 hydroxyl group is positioned to form hydrogen bonds with both the α-amino and hydroxyl groups of Thr-380. These interactions help to position the catalytic nucleophile and increase its reactivity. Attack at the γ-glutamyl peptide bond leads to the formation of a tetrahedral transition state that is stabilized through interactions with the backbone amides of Gly-472 and Gly-473, similar to the oxyanion hole observed in serine proteases (19Okada T. Suzuki H. Wada K. Kumagai H. Fukuyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6471-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate leads to the cleavage of the γ-glutamyl peptide bond, dissociation of cysteinylglycine, and the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate. We have indicated that the α-amino group of Thr-380 is the general acid responsible for protonation of the leaving group based on its proximity to the cysteine amide in the modeled glutathione-HpGT complex (Fig. 4; ∼3.5 Å). Activation of a water molecule, potentially by the Thr-380 α-amino group, leads to hydrolysis and regeneration of the active site. Ongoing studies in the laboratory are aimed at clarifying the speculative aspects of this model on the basis of our new structural insights.

However, the underlying mechanism of ethanol-induced ERK-1/2 modulation remains unknown. This investigation explored the effects of ethanol-associated oxidative stress on constitutive hepatic ERK-1/2 activity and assessed the contribution of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) to the observations made in vivo. Constitutive ERK-1/2 phosphorylation was suppressed in hepatocytes isolated from rats chronically consuming ethanol for 45 days. This observation was associated with an increase in 4-HNE-ERK monomer adduct concentration and a hepatic cellular and lobular redistribution of ERK-1/2 that correlated with 4-HNE-protein adduct accumulation. Chronic ethanol consumption was also associated with a decrease in hepatocyte nuclear ELK-1 phosphorylation, independent of changes in total nuclear ELK-1 protein. Primary hepatocytes treated with concentrations of 4-HNE consistent with those occurring during oxidative stress displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in constitutive ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, activity, and nuclear localization that negatively correlated with 4-HNE-ERK-1/2 monomer adduct accumulation. These data paralleled the decreased phosphorylation of the downstream kinase ELK-1. Molar ratios of purified ERK-2 to 4-HNE consistent with pathologic ratios found in vivo resulted in protein monomer-adduct formation across a range of concentrations.

Oxidative stress and the subsequent formation of reactive oxygen species have been correlated with a number of disease states in animal models and humans. It is well documented that chronic ethanol consumption results in hepatic oxidative stress (1Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

Schaur R.J. IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The production of reactive oxygen species during cellular oxidative stress is thought to be the key event initiating the autocatalytic degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids to yield electrophilic aldehyde species (1Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). These highly reactive lipid aldehydes are capable of diffusing from their point of origin to impose diverse effects on more distant cellular nucleophiles through covalent interactions (5Benedetti A. Casini A.F. Ferrali F. Comporti M. Biochem.

In fact, the adduction of proteins by 4-HNE has been demonstrated in vitro using purified proteins (6Uchida K. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Res. 2003; 27: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the specific protein targets of aldehyde modification and the resulting changes in normal liver function remain largely unknown. Although limited, in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that ethanol-induced 4-HNE modification of hepatocellular proteins results in the inhibition of normal enzyme function (34Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Sampey B.P. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res.

Ther. 2005; 315: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown recently, using an animal model of chronic ethanol consumption, that hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK-1/2) activity is suppressed under similar chronic conditions (37Aroor A.R. Shukla S.D. Life Sci. 2004; 74: 2339-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Chen J.P. Ishac E.J.N. Dent P. Kunos G. Gao B. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies led to the hypothesis that ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation results in the inhibition of constitutive, hepatic ERK-1/2 activity via covalent adduct formation with 4-HNE. This hypothesis is consistent with recent in vivo and primary cell culture data that demonstrate a correlation between ethanol exposure and the inhibition of ERK-1/2 in neurological and vascular pathologies (39Davis M.I. Szarowski D. Turner J.N. Morrisett R.A. Shain W. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 272: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Chandler L.J. Sutton G. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

Pharmacol. 1998; 362: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that ethanol-induced oxidative stress and the resulting lipid peroxidation products are predominantly inhibitory in nature. Consistent with this proposition, a series of combined in vivo/in vitro studies have demonstrated the adduction and inhibition of hepatic enzymes that are crucial for normal cell function and homeostasis, namely the cellular repair proteins heat shock protein-72 (Hsp-72), Hsp-90, and protein-disulfide isomerase (34Carbone D.L.

Ther. 2005; 315: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The anonymity of the vast number of 4-HNE-modified proteins demonstrated in the livers of ethanol-treated rats by Carbone et al. (34Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Sampey B.P. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Petersen D.R.

Ther. 2005; 315: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, suggests that the attenuating nature of 4-HNE on the constitutive function of other liver enzymes associated with normal hepatic function and homeostasis requires further investigation. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family whose activation results in cell growth, proliferation, and survival (42Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M.G. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar, 43Pearson G. Robinson F. Gibson T.B. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Because ERK-1 and ERK-2 are highly homologous (>83%) and are thought to carry out similar kinase functions within the cell, they are collectively referred to as ERK-1/2 (44Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). It is well documented that chronic ethanol consumption inhibits hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy or chemical-induced liver injury (45Duguay L. Coutu D. Hetu C. Joly J.G. Gut. 1982; 23: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 46Wands J.R. Carter E.A. Bucher N.L.R. Isselbacher K.J. Gastroenterology. 1979; 77: 528-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), implicating the dysregulation of the hepatic proliferative ERK-1/2 signaling pathway in ethanol-related liver disease. It has been shown recently that 4-HNE-protein adduct accumulation is an early event in the progression of ethanol-induced liver injury (9Sampey B.P. Korourian S. Ronis M.J. Badger T.M. Petersen D.R. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 27: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the research presented here set out to characterize the effects of chronic ethanol exposure and ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation on constitutive ERK-1/2 using a rat model of early ALD. The results of this study demonstrate that in vivo ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation increased hepatic 4-HNE-ERK-1/2 monomer adduct formation and decreased constitutive ERK-1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear localization. These data correlated with the cytosolic accumulation and hepatolobular redistribution of ERK-1/2 that paralleled the cytosolic and lobular accumulation of 4-HNE-protein adducts. These observations are correlated with an ethanol-induced decrease in nuclear ELK-1 phosphorylation that was independent of changes in total ELK-1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, in experiments using primary hepatocyte cultures, 4-HNE was shown to be a potent inhibitor of constitutive ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, activity, and nuclear localization. These results establish a strong correlation between ethanol-induced lipid peroxidation and the dysregulation of hepatocellular ERK-1/2, and suggest a novel inhibitory mechanism of 4-HNE via adduction of inactive ERK-1/2 monomers that results in the loss of a crucial hepatocellular pathway required for homeostasis, proliferation, and survival. Sequence Analysis—The amino acid sequences for extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (or Xenopus equivalent, myelin basic protein kinase) from Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, and Homo sapiens were obtained from NCBI (P63085, P63086, P26696, and P28482, respectively). These sequences were manually aligned according to the human sequence to determine the extent of homology and conservation of potential 4-HNE-reactive sites across experimental species, when compared with the human ERK-2 sequence. Animal Model—Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼250 g were obtained from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Ten ethanol-treated rats were fed a nutritionally fortified liquid diet (Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) containing 16% protein-derived calories, 45% fat-derived calories, 4% carbohydrate-derived calories, and 35% ethanol-derived calories. Ten pair-fed control rats were administered a similar diet containing carbohydrate-derived calories (39%) isocaloric to the amount of ethanol consumed by the alcohol-treated rats (34Carbone D.L. Doorn J.A. Kiebler Z. Sampey B.P. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Lindros K.O. Jarvelainen H.A. Alcohol Alcohol. 1998; 33: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The animals received ethanol or control diets for 45 days, at which time they were subdivided into two groups of five control and five ethanol-treated rats, and subjected to the following procedures. 1) Group 1 animals were anesthetized, and their livers removed, weighed, and fixed in paraffin for immunohistochemical and pathological analysis. 2) Group 2 animals were anesthetized, and their hepatocytes were isolated, using established procedures described elsewhere (3Hartley D.P. Kroll D.J. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Hartley D.P. Petersen D.R. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitors (4 μl/ml; Sigma) for total cell protein analysis. Prior to euthanization, venous blood was collected from all animals for serum alanine aminotransferase and ammonia analysis. Biochemical Assays—Hepatotoxicity resulting from chronic ethanol treatment was determined using appropriate biochemical assay kits measuring serum alanine aminotransferase activity and ammonia concentrations as per the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Histopathology, Immunostaining, and Imaging—Liver samples were routinely processed, and paraffin-embedded sections of the livers were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Immunostaining was carried out as described elsewhere (49Hartley D.P. Kolaja K.L. Reichard J. Petersen D.R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 161: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies specific for 4-HNE-adducted protein epitopes (3Hartley D.P. Kroll D.J. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), total and phosphorylated ERK-1/2, total and phosphorylated ELK-1 (Cell-Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated with liver sections at 4 °C overnight at 1:5000-, 1:1000-, 1:1000-, 1:50-, 1:50-, and 1:2500-fold dilutions, respectively. Immunopositive reactions were detected indirectly with a secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200). Visualization of primary and secondary antibody interactions was accomplished by using an avidin/biotinylated horseradish peroxidase kit (Pierce) incorporating 3′,3′-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. The absence of positive staining using this procedure in the absence of primary antibody established the lack of nonspecific staining because of the secondary antibody. Image-Pro Plus image acquisition and analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) integrating a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a digital camera was used to capture and analyze representative images of the stained serial sections at ×10, ×40, and ×80 magnifications for each animal treatment group. Primary Cell Culture and Treatment—Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated from naive, lab chow-fed male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Inc.) using identical procedures as described above and elsewhere (48Hartley D.P. Petersen D.R. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1997; 21: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The isolated hepatocytes were resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively), and the cells were plated onto extracellular matrix-coated (Sigma) 100-mm tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 3.5 million cells/plate. Adherent hepatocytes were allowed to acclimate to culture conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight before treatment with aldehyde. 4-HNE was synthesized immediately prior to cell treatment as described previously (50Mitchell D.Y. Petersen D.R. Hepatology. 1991; 13: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar). At the start of treatment, media from acclimatized, primary hepatocytes were removed and replaced with serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 μm 4-HNE for 4 h under normal cell culture conditions, a time point previously shown to be effective in similar experiments (51Tjalkens R.B. Luckey S.W. Kroll D.J. Petersen D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At the end of each treatment, the primary hepatocytes were liberated from the extracellular matrix-coated plates with ice-cold PBS, 1 mm EDTA solution, and the cells were resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitor mixture (PBS/PI). LDH Cytotoxicity Assay—The cytotoxicity of 4-HNE was determined using the in vitro cytotoxicity assay (Tox-7; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cytotoxicity is indirectly quantified as the ratio of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the media (released) over the total cellular LDH activity. Media and an aliquot of cells were collected at the appropriate time points for each cell treatment group and used immediately to determine LDH activity. Naive media and PBS/PI served as negative controls. LDH conversion of NAD to NADH was indirectly measured using a Spectra Max 190 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) plate reader, and the data were collected using SOFTmax PRO 4.0. “Relative cytotoxicity” is reported as the ratio of absorbance corresponding to released LDH activity over the total cellular LDH activity when compared with untreated cells. Cell Harvest and Protein Isolations—Total cell extracts were prepared by sonicating the hepatocyte suspensions four times for 5 s on ice using a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the total cell extract protein was quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml and either used immediately for kinase activity assays or mixed with 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. Alternatively, nuclear protein fractions were isolated from cell treatment groups using a nuclear isolation kit (Active Motif, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The nuclear protein fractions were quantified and diluted in PBS/PI to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Samples of total cell extracts (250 μg) were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA630) to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Monoclonal antibodies against ERK-1/2 were added to this mixture at a dilution of 1:100 (Cell Signaling), and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. At the end of incubation, 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose bead suspension (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each sample and gently mixed for 1 h at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 s; the supernatant was aspirated, and the beads were washed three times in 1 ml of IP buffer. The isolated beads were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, vortexed, and flash-centrifuged, and the supernatants were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoretic separation. For immunoblot analysis, immunoprecipitated protein, 15 μg of total cell extract, 7 μg of nuclear protein, or 250 ng of recombinant protein was denatured at 100 °C for 5 min in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for 2 h (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (52Luckey S.W. Taylor M. Sampey B.P. Scheinman R.I. Petersen D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween (TBS-T) at room temperature for 45 min. The primary antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-4-HNE-protein adducts (3Hartley D.P. Kroll D.J. Petersen D.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 895-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar); antibodies against total and phospho-specific ERK-1/2, total and phospho-specific ELK-1, and β-actin (Cell Signaling); and rabbit anti-GST-Ya (Oxford Biomedical Research, Oxford, MI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling. ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences) enhanced chemiluminescence reagent was used to visualize antibody-reactive protein bands via film and a STORM 860 (GE Healthcare) and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).

Here, we have investigated the signaling effects of β2 integrin Thr-758 phosphorylation. A penetratin-coupled phospho-Thr-758-β2 peptide (mimicking the part of the integrin β-chain surrounding Thr-758) stimulated adhesion of human T cells to the LFA-1 ligand intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Additionally, the peptide activated the small GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42 in T cells. Constitutively active forms of Rac-1 and Cdc42, but not Rho, could compensate for the reduction of cell adhesion to ICAM-1 caused by the T758A mutation in the β2 integrin. Additionally, the active GTPases salvaged the cell-spreading defect of T758A integrin-transfected cells on coated ICAM-1. A dominant negative form of Cdc42, on the other hand, significantly reduced wild-type β2 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. In a T cell stimulation system, the pThr-758 penetratin peptide acted in a similar manner to coated ICAM-1 to increase T cell receptor-induced CD69 expression. These results show that Thr-758-phosphorylated LFA-1 is upstream of Rac-1/Cdc42, cell adhesion, and costimulatory activation of human T cells, thus identifying phosphorylation of Thr-758 in β2 as a proximal element in LFA-1 signaling.

T cells are circulating cells that need to interact with other cells to perform their immunological functions. T cell adhesion is required during contact with endothelium (when T cells exit the bloodstream during normal leukocyte recirculation and in inflammation) and in contacts between T cells and antigen-presenting cells during antigen recognition. Most of these cellular interactions of T cells are dependent on the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1, 2The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; TCR, T cell receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; WT, wild type; PENA, penetratin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 2The abbreviations used are: LFA-1, leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; TCR, T cell receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; WT, wild type; PENA, penetratin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. αLβ2, CD11a/CD18) binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and other ICAM family members (1Springer T.A.

The LFA-1 integrin is a heterodimeric transmembrane protein that mediates bidirectional signaling over the plasma membrane. In resting cells, the integrin is inactive and does not bind ligands. However, when T cells are stimulated, for example through the T cell receptor (TCR) or chemokine receptors, intracellular signaling pathways are activated, resulting in LFA-1 activation. This is termed inside-out signaling. Many different signaling pathways and proteins have been implicated in LFA-1 activation, including protein kinases (3Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S.

Both changes in integrin conformation/affinity and changes in clustering and cytoskeletal contacts are important for integrin activation (9Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin.

The actin cytoskeleton plays essential roles in LFA-1 regulation; both initial release from the cytoskeleton to allow ligand encounter and reattachment of ligand-bound integrins to the cytoskeleton are important in the regulation of integrin adhesiveness (10van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Cairo C.W. Mirchev R. Golan D.E.

Binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin to the LFA-1 β-chain cytoplasmic domain leads to integrin conformational changes and activation (13Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A.

This is termed outside-in signaling. LFA-1 has been intimately linked to T cell costimulation, whereby ligation of the integrin together with TCR recognition of cognate antigen leads to full T cell activation. Many signaling pathways are activated after LFA-1 ligation, including phospholipase Cγ (15Kanner S.B. Grosmaire L.S. Ledbetter J.A. Damle N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The integrin cytoplasmic domains are short and devoid of catalytic activity. However, they are crucial for the regulation of integrin inside-out and outside-in signaling, through the interaction with cytoplasmic factors. Phosphorylation of the integrin α and β cytoplasmic domains regulates the interactions between integrins and cytoplasmic molecules and, thus, integrin adhesiveness and signaling (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Gahmberg C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation of LFA-1 on the αL-chain Ser-1140 regulates integrin affinity (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of LFA-1 on the β-chain on several residues occurs after cell stimulation, and especially a triplet of threonines (Thr-758-Thr-760) has been shown to be essential for regulated cell adhesion through the integrin to the ligand ICAM-1 (reviewed in Ref. 19Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Gahmberg C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 504-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thr-758 becomes phosphorylated in T cells after phorbol ester treatment or T cell receptor stimulation (20Hilden T.J. Valmu L. Karkkainen S. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4170-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and this leads to recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins to the integrin (5Fagerholm S. Morrice N. Gahmberg C.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1728-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are adaptor proteins that bind to phospho-serine- or phospho-threonine-containing sequences in proteins. The phospho-β2–14-3-3 association is required for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, cell spreading, and adhesion to ICAM-1 (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Additionally, Thr-phosphorylated LFA-1 is enriched in the cell cytoskeleton, implying that Thr phosphorylation may regulate LFA-1 cytoskeletal interactions (21Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the downstream effectors of the β2 integrin-14-3-3 interaction have remained unknown. Here, we have further investigated the role of Thr-758 phosphorylation of the integrin β2-chain in the regulation of adhesion and signaling through LFA-1. We show that treatment of T cells with Thr-758-phosphorylated cell-permeable integrin peptides leads to the activation of the small GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42, well known reorganizers of the actin cytoskeleton (22Cantrell D.A. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated integrin peptides also potently activated cell adhesion to ICAM-1. Active forms of Rac-1 and Cdc42 were able to compensate for the cell adhesion and actin rearrangement defects of the T758A-mutated β2-chain. Additionally, cell-permeable Thr-758-phosphorylated integrin peptides induced further signaling events, i.e. the surface expression of the T cell activation marker CD69, when used in conjunction with coated T cell receptor antibodies. This costimulation of T cells resembles the effect of coated ICAM-1. Thus, Thr-758 phosphorylation of the LFA-1 integrin β2-chain has a signaling function in T cells. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human ICAM-1 was obtained from R&D Systems, and the peptides (CLFKSATTTVMN (T-β2), CLFKSApTTTVMN (pT-β2), and CLKPLHEKDSEpSGGGKD (pαL), where pS is phospho-serine and pT is phospho-threonine) were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (23Valmu L. Hilden T.J. van Willigen G. Gahmberg C.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 119-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated penetratin peptide and biotin-penetratin peptide were purchased from Qbiogene and the Rac/Cdc42 assay reagent from Millipore. G418 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem and okadaic acid from Sigma. ICAM-1-Fc was produced by transient transfection of COS-1 cells and isolated from the culture supernatants by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described (24Kotovuori A. Pessa-Morikawa T. Kotovuori P. Nortamo P. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6613-6620PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies R2E7B and R7E4 against the human β2 subunit of leukocyte integrin have been described previously (25Nortamo P. Patarroyo M. Kantor C. Suopanki J. Gahmberg C.G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 28: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The monoclonal activating antibody against CD3, OKT3, was purified from ascites fluid produced by hybridoma cells (clone CRL 8001; American Type Culture Collection). The monoclonal antibodies against Rac-1 and Cdc42 were obtained from BD Biosciences, and the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The filamin antibody was from Chemicon International. To produce antiserum to phospho-β2, the integrin β2 chain phosphopeptide (CLFKSApTTTVMN) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 82-83Google Scholar). The complex was injected into rabbits. The antisera were purified by affinity chromatography using the phosphorylated peptide. EGFP-Rac-GTP, EGFP-Cdc42-GTP, EGFP-Rho-GTP, or EGFP-Cdc42-GDP constructs were kind gifts from P. Lappalainen (University of Helsinki). Cell Lines, Transfections, and Penetratin Peptide Treatments—Buffy coats used for the isolation of T cells were obtained from the Finnish Red Cross Transfusion Service (23Valmu L. Hilden T.J. van Willigen G. Gahmberg C.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 119-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The penetratin-coupled peptides were added in RPMI 1640 medium at 10-μm concentration or as indicated in Fig. legend 6 and incubated with the T cells for 1 h at 37°C without serum. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics and used for transient expression of WT and mutant β2 integrins. They were cotransfected with purified α- and β-subunit cDNAs with or without activated Rho family GTPases (27Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peranen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) EGFP-Rac-GTP (V12), EGFP-Cdc42-GTP (V12), EGFP-Rho-GTP (V14), or an inactive (GDP) form of Cdc42, EGFP-Cdc42-GDP (27Vartiainen M. Ojala P.J. Auvinen P. Peranen J. Lappalainen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1772-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). G418 was added at 0.8 mg/ml 24 h after transfection. Flow cytometric analysis was used to quantify cell surface expression of integrins in the transfected COS-1 cells. Cell Fractionation—T cell fractionation into soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions was done as described previously (8Fagerholm S.C. Prescott A. Cohen P. Gahmberg C.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rac/Cdc42 Pulldown Assay—Human T cells were treated with penetratin peptides or left untreated. Cells were lysed, and the Rac/Cdc42 assay reagent was used on the lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). The bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a Cdc42 antibody or Rac-1 antibody. MAPK activation in the cell lysates was investigated using a pMAP kinase antibody. Cell Adhesion Assays—Recombinant soluble ICAM-1 (0.3 μg/well) was coated on flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 1% dry milk (COS-1 cells) or 2% dry milk (T cells) for 1 h and 15 min at 37 °C. COS-1 cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 40 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2 binding medium and T cells in RPMI with 40 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm MgCl2 binding medium. Cells were allowed to adhere for 25 min at 37 °C after which the unbound cells were removed by gentle washing. The binding was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunofluorescence Staining—In the transfected COS-1-spreading assays, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto ICAM-1-coated coverslips and incubated for 65 min at 37 °C. Unbound cells were gently washed away, and adherent cells were fixed for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were labeled with TRITC-phalloidin in 0.1% saponin/1% fetal calf serum/phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. For detection of integrin-penetratin peptides in T cells, biotin-penetratin peptide-treated T cells were seeded onto OKT3-coated coverslips and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After fixing as above, cells were incubated with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Immunotools) in saponin buffer for 30 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting medium, observed under a fluorescence microscope (model IX71; Olympus), and photographed with a camera (model DP70; Olympus). Images were analyzed and processed using the analysis program (Soft Imaging System GmbH) and Adobe Photoshop. T Cell Stimulation Assay—T cells were further purified with a MACS pan-T cell kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ICAM-1-Fc and hIgG was biotinylated according to standard protocols with biotinamidocaproate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma), 100 μg/mg protein. The degree of biotinylation was examined by quantitation of binding to Streptavidin-Sepharose. For the solid phase stimulation system, avidin (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.) was coated onto 24-well plates at 50 μg/ml. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, 100 ng of biotin-UCHT1 (Ancell Corp., Bayport, MN) together with either 100 ng of biotin-ICAM-1-Fc or 100 ng of biotin-hIgG were added on the avidin-coated wells (the total amount of biotinylated protein in each well was 200 ng). Purified T cells were treated with penetratin peptides or left untreated, added onto the wells (0.5–1 million cells/well), and stimulated for 4–20 h. CD69 expression was examined by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry—Basic protocols were used for surface staining of purified T cells. The CD69-phycoerythrin conjugate was from ImmunoTools (Friesoythe, Germany). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences). CD69 expression was reported as mean fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, the activated cell population (positive for CD69 expression) was gated and analyzed separately to determine the percentage of activated cells or mean fluorescence intensity of activated cells. Thr-758 Is Phosphorylated Only in Stimulated T Cells—The phospho-Thr-758-β2–14-3-3 complex is essential for LFA-1-mediated adhesion, actin reorganization, and cell spreading (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To be able to further study the Thr-758-phosphorylated integrin in cells, we generated a phospho-specific antibody capable of recognizing β2 only when it is phosphorylated on Thr-758. The antibody was purified using the phosphopeptide antigen. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blotting of lysates of COS-1 cells expressing WTβ2 and Thr-758A-β2, where Thr-758 had been mutated into nonphosphorylatable alanine. The cells were either activated with okadaic acid and phorbol ester or left untreated. The antibody recognized only the WT β2 polypeptide after okadaic acid and phorbol ester treatment and did not bind to the mutated β2 polypeptide (Fig. 1A). Thus, the antibody is sequence- and phospho-specific. This antibody was used on T cell lysates that were either treated with okadaic acid and OKT3 (monoclonal activating antibody against CD3) or left untreated. The phospho-specific antibody recognized the β2 polypeptide only from T cells that were stimulated with OKT3 (Fig. 1B), confirming specific phosphorylation of Thr-758 in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (20Hilden T.J. Valmu L. Karkkainen S. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4170-4177Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using the pThr-758-phospho-specific antibody, we investigated the distribution of Thr-758-phosphorylated integrins in detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions from activated T cells. The Thr-758-phosphorylated integrins were found both in the soluble and insoluble (cytoskeletal) fractions of activated T cells (Fig. 1C), indicating that the phosphorylation does not directly regulate cytoskeletal attachment of activated integrins. A Cell-permeable Phospho-Thr-758-β2 Peptide Induces T Cell Adhesion to ICAM-1—It has previously been shown that the β2 integrin phosphorylated on Thr-758 specifically binds to 14-3-3 proteins, resulting in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and increased cell adhesion to ICAM-1 (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These functional studies were, however, conducted in COS-1 cells. Thus, we were interested to study the role of Thr-758-phosphorylated β2 integrins in T cells. To do this, we coupled integrin cytoplasmic peptides (pT-β2, T-β2, and pαL) to activated penetratin (PENA) peptides, which are able to carry coupled peptide sequences into cells. Intracellular localization of the peptides was confirmed by using biotin-penetratin-coupled peptides (Fig. 2A). To examine the effect of the penetratin-coupled integrin peptides on adhesion, T cells that were treated with either penetratin peptides or phorbol ester or were left untreated were seeded on wells coated with the β2 integrin ligand ICAM-1. Phorbol ester-treated T cells adhered to ICAM-1 (Fig. 2B). The same effect could be seen with T cells treated with the phosphorylated Thr-758-β2 penetratin peptide (Fig. 2B). The pT-β2 penetratin peptide also increased adhesion of phorbol ester-stimulated cells (not shown). Specificity of pThr-758-β2 penetratin-induced adhesion to ICAM-1 was shown by treatment of cells with R7E4, a blocking LFA-1 antibody (Fig. 2B). A penetratin peptide coupled to an unphosphorylated β2 peptide (T-β2) did not induce adhesion of T cells to ICAM-1, and neither did a Ser-1140-phosphorylated αL peptide (pαL). These results confirm the importance of the Thr-758-phosphorylated β2–14-3-3 complex in the regulation of LFA-1-mediated T cell adhesion to the ligand ICAM-1. Rac-1/Cdc42 Is Activated by the Thr-758-phosphorylated β2 Integrin—Next, we sought to determine the downstream effector of the phospho-Thr-758 β2 integrin in the regulation of cell adhesion. Because the large amounts of peptide introduced into cells induced, rather than inhibited, adhesion, the phosphorylation did not seem to play a role in linking the active integrin to the actin cytoskeleton through 14-3-3 binding, in which case the peptide would presumably have competed with endogenous phosphorylated integrins for cytoskeletal attachment and cell adhesion. We thus examined the possibility that the phosphorylated β2 integrin-14-3-3 protein complex might instead affect the activity of some enzyme, which then in turn would affect the cytoskeleton. The small GTP-binding proteins Rac-1 and Cdc42 are well known mediators of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements in cells in response to various stimuli and play important roles in T cell signaling (22Cantrell D.A. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganization has been shown to be initiated by the small GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42 (18Sanchez-Martin L. Sanchez-Sanchez N. Gutierrez-Lopez M.D. Rojo A.I. Vicente-Manzanares M. Pérez-Alvarez M.J. Sánchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Cuadrado A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Rodríguez-Fernández J.L. Cabañas C. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), we performed a Rac/Cdc42 pull-down assay on penetratin peptide-treated T cells. When the cells were treated with the pT-β2 penetratin peptide the activation of both Rac-1 and Cdc42 was elevated ∼40% (Fig. 3, A–C). In contrast, the pαl penetratin peptide could not activate Rac-1 or Cdc42 (Fig. 3, A–C). We detected no activation of the p42/p44-MAPK pathway by using pMAPK antibodies in Western blots from the penetratin peptide-treated T cell lysates (not shown), indicating that the pThr-758-β2 peptide does not induce a general activation of signaling pathways. Constitutively Active Rac-1 and Cdc42 Compensate for Effect of the T758A-mutated β2 Integrin—The T758A mutation of the β2 integrin has previously been shown to inhibit adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1 when transfected into COS cells, where WT LFA-1 is constitutively active (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 associates with WT β2, but not with T758A-β2, in COS-1 cells, and blocking the 14-3-3-β2 complex inhibits WT LFA-1-mediated adhesion (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether Rac-1/Cdc42 is downstream of pThr-758-β2 and 14-3-3, we studied whether the constitutively active Rac-1 and Cdc42 were able to compensate for the effect of the T758A mutation in the COS-1 system. COS-1 cells were transfected with the T758A-mutated β2 integrin along with constitutively active Rac-1 or Cdc42. The constitutively active forms were indeed able to compensate for the reduced adhesion of the T758A-mutated LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (Fig. 4A). However, this compensation was only seen with Rac-1 and Cdc42 whereas another small GTPase, Rho, actually inhibited cell adhesion of both the wild-type (not shown) and mutated LFA-1 to ICAM-1 (Fig. 4A). This effect of Rho on WT LFA-1-mediated adhesion has previously been described (29Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Sanchez-Martin L. Rey M. Vicente-Manzanares M. Narumiya S. Teixido J. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabanas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40518-40527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The level of green fluorescent proteins and cell surface LFA-1 integrins in the EGFP-positive cells was equal in Rac-1-GTP, Cdc42-GTP, and RhoA-GTP cells as examined by flow cytometry. 3S. C. Fagerholm and S. H. Nurmi, unpublished data. The T758A mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of the β2 integrin, as well as blocking the β2–14-3-3 interaction has also been shown to be closely associated with defects in integrin-mediated actin reorganization and cell spreading on ICAM-1 (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the constitutively active forms of Rac-1 and Cdc42 were able to compensate for the loss of the Thr-758 phosphorylation site in cell-spreading assays. Transfected COS cells were seeded onto coverslips coated with ICAM-1. The constitutively active Rac-1 and Cdc42 compensated for the T758A mutation of the β2 integrin, because the cells were able to attach and spread on ICAM-1 in a similar manner as WT β2 integrin-transfected cells (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, active Rho was not able to compensate for the loss of threonine 758 of the β2 integrin in the cell-spreading assay (Fig. 4, B and C). The Adhesion and Spreading of WT β2 Integrin-transfected Cells to ICAM-1 Are Reduced by Dominant Negative Cdc42—To further investigate the involvement of small GTPases in LFA-1-mediated adhesion, we next went on to study the effect of dominant negative Cdc42 on the adhesion of WT β2 integrin to ICAM-1 (Fig. 5A). The dominant negative construct indeed caused a significant decrease in cell adhesion of WT β2-transfected COS cells to coated ICAM-1. Additionally, this construct reduced WT LFA-1-mediated cell spreading on coated ICAM-1 (Fig. 5B). We also examined the effect of dominant negative Cdc42 on pT-β2 penetratin-induced adhesion (Fig. 5C). Indeed, the dominant negative construct significantly reduced cell adhesion to ICAM-1 induced by the phosphorylated peptide. These results further confirm that this group of small GTPases is involved in regulating LFA-1 adhesion downstream of pThr-758. The level of GFP proteins and cell surface LFA-1 integrins in the EGFP-positive cells was equal in Cdc42-GDP cells, as examined by flow cytometry.3 The pThr-758 Penetratin Peptide Can Induce Downstream Signaling in Conjunction with TCR Antibodies in a T Cell Stimulation System—Ligation of the T cell receptor alone is not enough to induce full T cell activation. Instead, a costimulatory signal is needed, to avoid T cell anergy (non-responsiveness). LFA-1 can act as a costimulatory receptor for T cell activation by activating downstream signaling events after binding to its ligands (16Geginat J. Bossi G. Bender J.R. Pardi R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5085-5093PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ni H.T. Deeths M.J. Li W. Mueller D.L. Mescher M.F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5183-5189PubMed Google Scholar, 30Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C.

Rev. 2002; 186: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To study whether pThr-758 was involved in further downstream signaling events through the activation of Rac-1/Cdc42, we made use of a cell stimulation system, where T cell receptor antibodies (UCHT1) or control antibodies were coated onto wells and T cells treated with the different penetratin peptides were added to the wells. As a control of T cell costimulation, the LFA-1 ligand ICAM-1 was coated together with UCHT1 (Fig. 6A). After 4–20 h of incubation, the expression level of the CD69 receptor (an early marker of T cell activation) was measured by flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, ICAM-1 significantly increased CD69 expression in T cells when coated together with UCHT1. Next, we examined the effect of penetratin peptides together with coated UCHT1 on CD69 expression. When the whole cell population was examined, the stimulatory effect (increased CD69 expression compared with UCHT1 alone) was seen to be increased with the pThr-758-β2 peptide (2-fold stimulation) but also with the pαL peptide (1.7-fold stimulation), indicating that also αL in the phosphorylated form can induce T cell stimulation (Fig. 6B). A lower effect was seen with the nonphosphorylated β2 peptide, whereas the uncoupled penetratin peptide did not induce additional CD69 expression (Fig. 6B). The small stimulatory effect seen after cell treatment with the nonphosphorylated β2 peptide may be due to phosphorylation of this integrin peptide in cells, as has been previously reported (21Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Penetratin peptides alone without UCHT1 showed no effect on CD69 expression (Fig. 6B). When the percentage of activated cells was examined, it was found that the pThr-758-β2 peptide and the pαL peptide both increased the amount of activated cells when used together with UCHT1, whereas the nonphosphorylated β2 peptide and penetratin alone could not increase the amount of activated cells (Fig. 6C). When the activated T cell population was examined for CD69 expression, penetratin without coupled peptides in conjunction with T cell receptor antibodies already induced some increase in CD69 expression (Fig. 6D). This may be the result of cell membrane changes that make T cells more unspecifically adhesive. However, compared with other integrin peptides coupled to penetratin, pThr-758-β2 showed a larger effect on CD69 levels in the activated T cell population (Fig. 6D), whereas the other peptides induced CD69 levels comparable with uncoupled penetratin. In this study, we have investigated the signaling downstream of the Thr-758-phosphorylated LFA-1 in cells. We have shown that Thr-758 is indeed phosphorylated in T cells activated with OKT3 (a T cell receptor antibody), by using a novel phospho-specific antibody to this site. We have previously described that Thr-phosphorylated integrins are enriched in the cell cytoskeleton (21Valmu L. Fagerholm S. Suila H. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2107-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), arguing for a role of Thr-758 phosphorylation in LFA-1 cytoskeletal attachment and, thus, adhesion strengthening. Here we show that Thr-758-phosphorylated integrins are indeed enriched in, but not exclusively restricted to, the cell cytoskeleton. This result, as well as our failure to detect any significant differences between WT β2 and TTT/AAA-mutated β2 distribution in cytoskeletal and soluble fractions in transfected COS cells,3 seems to exclude a simple cytoskeletal linking function for the pThr-758-β2–14-3-3 complex in cell adhesion. By using a penetratin-coupled Thr-758-phosphorylated β2-peptide, we have shown that this specific phosphorylation is important for regulating integrin-mediated T cell adhesion. The importance of the TTT region in adhesion has been previously shown in transfected COS and leukocyte adhesion deficiency cells by mutational studies (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the penetratin method provides an alternative and a more direct approach than mutational experiments to study the effect of specific phosphorylations, especially in primary cells. 14-3-3 binds to pThr-758-β2 integrins in activated T cells (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This complex could influence adhesion in several ways, by linking phosphorylated integrins together to induce clustering, for example, or by linking phosphorylated integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, the ability of the pThr-758 penetratin peptide to stimulate, rather than inhibit, adhesion indicated that the role of the pThr-758-β2–14-3-3 complex may not be one of a simple cytoskeletal linker or inducer of clustering of integrins; rather, it seems to have a signaling role in T cells. To study the possible downstream mediators of the pThr-758-β2 penetratin peptide, we examined the small GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42, which have previously been implicated in integrin 14-3-3 signaling (33Bialkowska K. Zaffran Y. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33342-33350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additionally, Rac-1 is involved in LFA-1 activation (3Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Indeed, pThr-758-β2 penetratin activated both Rac-1 and Cdc42 in human T cells. Thus, we investigated the effect of constitutively active Rac-1 and Cdc42 constructs on integrin-mediated functions that are defective in T758A-β2-transfected cells. We found that the active forms of these GTPases could compensate for both the adhesion and cell-spreading defects of the mutated integrin in cells. Also, a dominant negative Cdc42 construct significantly reduced both constitutive and pThr-758-β2 penetratin-induced LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1, as well as actin reorganization and cell spreading. Together, these results implicate Rac-1 and Cdc42 as downstream effectors of the Thr-758-phosphorylated integrin 14-3-3 complex in T cells. In light of the recently reported results on RhoA being downstream of the β2 threonine triplet in Mac-1(CD11b/CD18, αMβ2)-mediated monocyte phagocytosis (34Wiedemann A. Patel J.C. Lim J. Tsun A. van Kooyk Y. Caron E. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it is clear that small GTPases of the Rho family are essential downstream effectors of the leukocyte integrins in several β2 integrin-mediated functions and that the functionally important threonines in β2 mediate the activation of these GTPases. To further study the effect of the phosphorylated integrin on T cell-mediated functions, we used a T cell stimulation system to study downstream signaling of the integrin in conjunction with T cell receptor antibodies. LFA-1 has been clearly implicated as a costimulatory receptor in T cells (16Geginat J. Bossi G. Bender J.R. Pardi R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5085-5093PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ni H.T. Deeths M.J. Li W.

Rev. 2002; 186: 100-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and an additional phosphorylation site, Ser-745 (5Fagerholm S. Morrice N. Gahmberg C.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1728-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), has been implicated in LFA-1 signaling (30Perez O.D. Mitchell D. Jager G.C. South S. Murriel C. McBride J. Herzenberg L.A. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here, we show that T cell receptor antibodies, together with the pThr-758-β2 penetratin peptide, can induce further downstream signaling (expression of the T cell activation marker CD69) in T cells in a similar manner to coated TCR antibody together with ICAM-1. The LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction has previously been shown to induce Rac-1 activation in T cells (18Sanchez-Martin L. Sanchez-Sanchez N. Gutierrez-Lopez M.D. Rojo A.I. Vicente-Manzanares M. Pérez-Alvarez M.J. Sánchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Cuadrado A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Rodríguez-Fernández J.L. Cabañas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and Rac-1 has been implicated in the up-regulation of CD69 expression in T cells (35Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixeiro E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the pThr-758-β2 penetratin costimulatory effect may be due to Rac-1 activation. The large amount of phosphorylated integrin peptides introduced into cells by penetratin may mimic the clustering of LFA-1 integrins induced by ICAM-1 in other stimulatory systems leading to Rac-1 activation (18Sanchez-Martin L. Sanchez-Sanchez N. Gutierrez-Lopez M.D. Rojo A.I. Vicente-Manzanares M. Pérez-Alvarez M.J. Sánchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Cuadrado A. Sánchez-Madrid F. Rodríguez-Fernández J.L. Cabañas C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, we have shown that 1) phosphorylation of Thr-758 in β2 leads to T cell adhesion to ICAM-1, 2) phosphorylation of Thr-758 leads to Rac-1/Cdc42 activation and further T cell signaling, and 3) active forms of Rac-1 and Cdc42 can compensate for the T758A mutation in cell adhesion and spreading assays, while a dominant negative construct of Cdc42 reduces WT LFA-1-mediated adhesion. These results clearly implicate Rac-1 and Cdc42 as downstream mediators of β2 Thr-758 phosphorylation in T cells (Fig. 7). The Thr-758-phosphorylated β2 peptide binds 14-3-3 in vitro and in cells (11Fagerholm S.C. Hilden T.J. Nurmi S.M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 proteins are dimers and are able to interact with two phosphorylated targets at the same time, thus functioning as adapter proteins (36Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 37Van Der Hoeven P.C. Van Der Wal J.C. Ruurs P. Van Dijk M.C. Van Blitterswijk J. Biochem.

Biol. 2004; 14: 1436-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) have shown that 14-3-3 proteins bind many proteins involved in small GTP-binding protein regulation in cells, for example, a Rac-1/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Thus, it is conceivable that a phospho-β2–14-3-3 guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex works on the small GTPases in T cells, thereby mediating their activation. The activation of small GTPases downstream of the phosphorylated β2 integrins ultimately leads both to increased cell adhesion and further downstream signaling events through intermediate steps that remain to be established (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W1993266290,"The initial event in establishing a polarized neuron is the specification of a single axon. Spatially regulated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity is critical for specifying axon-dendrite fate; however, the upstream signaling of GSK-3β in the determination of neuronal polarity still remains obscure. Here, we found that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, the small GTPase R-Ras selectively localized in a single neurite of stage 2 neurons and that its activity increased after plating and peaked between stages 2 and 3. Ectopic expression of R-Ras induced global inactivation of GSK-3β and formation of multiple axons, whereas knockdown of endogenous R-Ras by RNA interference blocked GSK-3β inactivation and axon formation. GSK-3β inactivation and axon formation by R-Ras required integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and subcellular localization of ILK was strictly regulated by R-Ras-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. In addition, membrane targeting of ILK was sufficient to inactivate GSK-3β and to form multiple axons. Our study demonstrates a novel role of R-Ras and ILK upstream of GSK-3β in the regulation of neuronal polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2038397950,"RGK proteins, encompassing Rad, Gem, Rem1, and Rem2, constitute an intriguing branch of the Ras superfamily; their expression is regulated at the transcription level, they exhibit atypical nucleotide binding motifs, and they carry both large N- and C-terminal extensions. Biochemical and structural studies are required to better understand how such proteins function. Here, we report the first structure for a RGK protein: the crystal structure of a truncated form of the human Gem protein (G domain plus the first part of the C-terminal extension) in complex with Mg.GDP at 2.1 A resolution. It reveals that the G-domain fold and Mg.GDP binding site of Gem are similar to those found for other Ras family GTPases. The first part of the C-terminal extension adopts an alpha-helical conformation that extends along the alpha5 helix and interacts with the tip of the interswitch. Biochemical studies show that the affinities of Gem for GDP and GTP are considerably lower (micromolar range) compared with H-Ras, independent of the presence or absence of N- and C-terminal extensions, whereas its GTPase activity is higher than that of H-Ras and regulated by both extensions. We show how the bulky DXWEX motif, characteristic of the switch II of RGK proteins, affects the conformation of switch I and the phosphate-binding site. Altogether, our data reveal that Gem is a bona fide GTPase that exhibits striking structural and biochemical features that should impact its regulation and cellular activities."

When the heptameric pre-insertion form of PA (the prepore) is acidified in solution, it rapidly loses the ability to insert into membranes. To maximize insertion into model membranes, we examined two ways to bind the protein to large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). One involved attaching a His tag to the von Willebrand factor A domain of one of the PA receptors, ANTXR2, and using this protein as a bridge to bind PA to LUV containing a nickel-chelating lipid. The other involved using a His tag fused to the C terminus of PA to bind the protein directly to LUV containing the same lipid. Both ways enhanced pore formation at pH 5.0 strongly and about equally, as measured by the release of K+. Controls showed that pore formation in this system faithfully reproduced that in vivo. We also showed that binding unmodified ANTXR2 von Willebrand factor A to the prepore in solution enhanced its pore forming activity by slowing its inactivation at acidic pH. These findings indicate that an important role of PA receptors is to promote partitioning of PA into the bilayer by maintaining the prepore close to the target membrane and presumably in the optimal orientation as it undergoes the acidic pH-dependent conformational transition to the pore.

Many toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria act by enzymically modifying intracellular target molecules. Most of these toxins are bipartite entities, so-called A-B toxins in which one part, the B (binding) moiety, binds to a cell surface receptor and facilitates delivery of the other part, the A (catalytic) moiety, to the cytosol (1Barth H. Aktories K. Popoff M.R. Stiles B.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 373-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In some of these toxins the B moiety, besides binding to a receptor, also has the ability to undergo membrane insertion and form a pore (channel). The structures and functions of such pores are of great interest in understanding how toxin A moieties translocate across membranes.

PA (83 kDa) binds to cell-surface receptors and is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease to an active, 63-kDa form (PA63) (2Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol.

PA63 oligomerizes into a heptameric, receptor-bound prepore, which contains high-affinity binding sites for EF and/or LF (3Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The entire toxin-receptor complex is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and within the endosome the prepore undergoes an acidic pH-dependent conformational rearrangement to form a cation-selective, transmembrane pore (4Collier R.J.

Both are type-I transmembrane proteins, containing a signal sequence, an extracellular von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, and a single-pass transmembrane region. The VWA domains of ANTXR1 and ANTXR2 contain a conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif. The ANTXR2 VWA domain (abbreviated as R2 below) binds PA with high affinity (Kd ≈ 170 pm when liganded by Mg2+) (9Wigelsworth D.J. Krantz B.A. Christensen K.A. Lacy D.B. Juris S.J. Collier R.J. J.

X-ray structural studies of complexes consisting of R2 bound to PA or to the heptameric prepore have revealed that R2 binds not only to PA domain 4 (receptor binding domain) but also to domain 2 (10Lacy D.B.

Domain 2 contains a mobile loop, the 2β2–2β3 loop (residues 303–322), and the seven 2β2–2β3 loops of PA heptamer are believed to move to the base of the structure during the low pH-induced conformational rearrangement to form a 14-strand transmembrane β-barrel (12Petosa C.

Whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements of PA pore current have shown that ANTXR2 mediates PA pore formation on the plasma membrane of cultured cells when they are exposed to acidic conditions (13Wolfe J.T.

Liposomes have been widely used as model systems to study protein-membrane interactions. In an early study, the PA prepore was found to permeabilize unilamellar asolectin vesicles (lacking receptors) to K+ under acidic conditions (14Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol.

Collier, unpublished observation. suggested that PA did not partition efficiently into liposomal membranes. In an attempt to make liposomes a more useful model system for studying this toxin, we have now devised ways to bind PA to the surface of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). Synthetic Ni2+-chelating lipids provide a convenient way to attach His-tagged proteins to liposomal membranes (15Pack D.W. Arnold F.H. Chem. Phys.

We also prepared PA containing a His tag at its C terminus, enabling it to bind directly to the surface of LUV containing the Ni2+-chelating lipid. The effects of binding PA to LUV on toxin assembly and pore formation were examined and are reported below. Plasmid Construction—ANTXR2 cDNA encoding residues Ser38-Cys218 was inserted into pET15b at NdeI and BamHI sites, which resulted in a construct pET15b-ANTXR2(Ser38-Cys218) that expressed a N-terminally His6-tagged ANTXR2 VWA domain, His-R2. ANTXR2 cDNA encoding residues Ser38-Cys218 was amplified by PCR (Forward primer: ggt ggt gaa ttc tcc tgc aga cga gcc ttt g; Reverse primer: ggt ggt ctc gag tca atg gtg atg gtg atg atg aca tga ctg agc tag tat aga att) to add a His6 sequence after Cys218. The amplified DNA was inserted into pGEX-4T at EcoRI and XhoI sites to generate a construct, pGEX4T-ANTXR2(Ser38-Cys218)-His6, that expresses a GST-R2-His fusion protein.

LFN-DTA, a fusion of the PA-binding domain of LF (LFN) with the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin (DTA) was expressed and purified as described (18Milne J.C. Blanke S.R. Hanna P.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). His-R2 was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified by metal (Ni2+) affinity chromatography followed by dialysis in buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.5) to remove imidazole. GST-R2-His was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified by metal (Ni2+) affinity chromatography. The GST tag was cleaved by thrombin, and free GST and thrombin were removed by passing through a glutathione-Sepharose column and a benzamidine column. PA-His was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and purified by metal affinity chromatography followed by a size-exclusion chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined from the A280 using calculated extinction coefficients. Nicked PA (nPA) and PA heptamer prepore were prepared as described (19Miller C.J. Elliott J.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10432-10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Liposome Preparation—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{[N(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid]succinyl} (nickel salt) (DOGs-NTA-Ni) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. DOPC (20 mg/ml) and DOGs-NTA-Ni (10 mg/ml) in chloroform were mixed at the indicated molar ratio, the lipid mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas to form a lipid film, and the lipid film was placed under high vacuum for 3 h to remove all residual solvent. The dried lipid film was rehydrated with proper buffers to form multilamellar vesicles, which were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles and extrusion through a 200-nm pore size polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore Inc.) using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Size-exclusion chromatography and cryo-electron microscopy were used to check the quality of the prepared LUV. The majority of liposomes were unilamellar, with diameter ∼150–200 nm. Variation in the mol % of DOGs-NTA-Ni did not change the diameter of liposomes. K+ Release Assay—The K+ release assay was performed as described (14Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with modifications. A K+ buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4) was used to rehydrate the dry lipid film followed by three freeze-thaw cycles and extrusion. Right before K+ release assay, the K+ buffer-rehydrated liposomes were subjected to buffer exchange by passing them through a G-50 column equilibrated with a Na+-containing buffer (10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The resulting liposomes, with K+ inside and Na+ outside, were mixed with indicated proteins at pH 8.5 (the pH of the liposome-protein mixture was adjusted to pH 8.5 by adding 1/20 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). After 30 min at room temperature, the protein-liposome mixture (total 200 μl) was added to 5 ml of 10 mm buffers (NaAc, pH 4.5–5.0; Bistris, pH 5.5–6.5; HEPES, pH 7.0–7.5; Tris-Cl, pH 8–9) containing 100 mm NaCl. The mixtures were stirred continuously using a magnetic stirrer, and release of K+ from liposomes was monitored using a K+-selective electrode (Orion Research) connected to a microcomputer pH/mV/Temp meter 6171. The signal was transmitted by a data transmitter (DATAQ) and displayed with DATAQ software. The channel-forming peptide, gramicidin A (5 μg/ml), was added to determine the total or remaining K+ in the liposomes. Note: Because of intrinsic variables and limitations in preparation, different pools of liposomes differed in terms of the liposome concentration, the amounts of residual K+ outside liposomes, and entrapped K+ inside. Therefore, a control, buffer alone, was always included in the experiments, enabling the results obtained from the same pool of liposome preparation to be compared. His-tagged Protein-Liposome Binding Assay—LUV (200 nm) prepared in present study can be easily collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min (17Chikh G.G. Li W.M. Schutze-Redelmeier M.P. Meunier J.C. Bally M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1567: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 20Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 372: 99-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified His-tagged proteins were incubated with liposomes at indicated conditions. Membranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g for at least 30 min in an airfuge, and the pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Time-lapse Intensity Measurements of NBD Emission—PA mutants G305C and N306C were labeled with NBD (N,N′-dimethyl-N(iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol)ethylenediamine) as described (21Qa'dan M. Christensen K.A. Zhang L. Roberts T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5492-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The liposomes (DOPC:DOGs-NTA-Ni = 100:8) were incubated with indicated proteins at pH 8.5 for 30 min at room temperature, and the incubated protein-liposome mixture (total volume, 1.8 ml) was transferred to a cuvette with a stirring bar in an ISS K2 fluorometer. The NBD was excited at 488 nm, and emission was recorded at 544 nm. Crossed polarizers on excitation, emission beams, and a 520-nm filter were used to reduce the background because of scatter. After addition of 0.2 ml of 1 m pH 8.5 buffer or pH 5.0 buffer to the cuvette, a sharp decrease of the background scatter signal was observed because of dilution. This was followed by a specific signal resulting from shifting NBD from a polar (solution) to a non-polar environment (liposomal membrane). Acidic Conditions Cause Rapid Inactivation of the PA Prepore—It is well documented that purified PA prepore and nPA can form ion-conductive pores in planar phospholipid bilayers and unilamellar asolectin vesicles under acidic conditions (14Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2209-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 23Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys.

Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The heptameric prepore rapidly loses the ability to form ion-conductive pores when exposed to acidic pH, however, limiting the partitioning into membranes. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of membranes the prepore loses a large fraction of its ability to induce K+ leakage from KCl-loaded DOPC LUV within 15 s after being exposed to pH 5.0 buffer, and this activity is almost completely lost within 1 min. We observed a similar inactivation when prepore was acidified before being added to planar bilayers 4B. Krantz, R. Melnyk, and R. Collier, unpublished data. . Under acidic conditions, the prepore converts to an SDS-resistant state and forms aggregates, suggesting mechanisms for this inactivation. His-R2 Mediates Binding of PA to Liposomes Containing Ni2+-chelating Lipids—In principle it should be possible to increase the partitioning of PA into liposomes by binding the protein to the membrane surface before it is exposed to low pH. To examine the use of a receptor domain to mediate binding of PA to membranes, we first prepared an N-terminally His-tagged form of the ANTXR2 VWA domain (His-R2) and measured its binding to DOPC LUV doped with various levels of the Ni2+-chelating lipid (DOGs-NTA-Ni). The binding showed a clear dependence on DOGs-NTA-Ni up through 16 mol % (Fig. 2A). The binding reached equilibrium by 15 min, and there was no nonspecific binding of His-R2 with extended incubation times. Imidazole effectively inhibited the binding, consistent with a Ni2+-mediated interaction (supplemental Fig. 1). The behavior of a C-terminally His-tagged ANTXR2 VWA domain (R2-His) was identical to that of the N-terminally tagged protein (data not shown), consistent with the locations of the N and C termini of the ANTXR2 VWA domain; adjacent to each other and diametrically opposite the conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site motif, the focal point of PA binding (10Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We incubated PA with His-R2 and LUV containing 8% DOGs-NTA-Ni and then isolated the membranes by centrifugation and analyzed their associated proteins by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2B, binding of PA to liposomes was at background levels in the absence of His-R2 and increased dramatically in its presence. Next, we tested the requirements for binding of LFN-DTA to liposomes (Fig. 2C). LFN-DTA, a fusion protein consisting of the enzymatic domain of DTA fused to the C terminus of the LFN, enters cells via the same pathway as LF and EF and blocks protein synthesis. Binding of LFN-DTA to nickel-containing liposomes was observed in the presence of His-R2 and trypsin-activated PA (nPA) (Fig. 2C). Native PA did not functionally replace the activated form, consistent with the fact that LF and EF bind to oligomers of PA63, which form only after proteolytic activation of PA. The results suggest that nPA associated with liposomes via His-R2, and after dissociation of PA20, PA63 oligomerized on the liposomal membrane, allowing LFN-DTA to bind. His-R2-dependent, PA-mediated Pore Formation—As shown in Fig. 3A, binding to His-R2 greatly increased the activity of nPA in releasing entrapped K+ from DOPC liposomes containing 8% DOGs-NTA-Ni (pH 5.0.) Within 60 s K+ release in the presence of His-R2 reached a level close to that seen following addition of gramicidin. In the absence of His-R2, the level of release by nPA was much lower. His-R2-dependent K+ release was strongly dependent on acidic pH and showed a sharp threshold at pH ∼5.5 (Fig. 3B). In the absence of His-R2, the release was slower and more limited, and the threshold was about one pH unit higher. These results are consistent with the observation that binding of ANTXR2 VWA domain to PA prepore shifts the pH threshold of prepore-pore conversion to a more acidic pH range (10Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Free and His-R2-complexed prepore gave results similar to those with free and His-R2-complexed nPA, respectively, in releasing K+ as a function of pH. We characterized two PA mutants as controls in the K+ release assay. D512K, an oligomerization-deficient PA mutant (3Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7045-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), showed low K+ release compared with wild-type nPA when complexed with His-R2 (Fig. 4A), indicating that PA63 oligomerization was required. The other mutant, PA (K397D, D425K), oligomerizes to form the prepore but is unable to undergo the conformational change to the pore (25Sellman B.R. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Sellman B.R. Nassi S. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8371-8376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This mutant is also a dominant-negative inhibitor (DNI) of toxin action; when the mutant co-assembles with wild-type PA, it inhibits pore formation and translocation. When complexed with His-R2, the DNI homoheptamer gave almost no K+ release, and the population of heteroheptamers assembled from a 1:1 mixture of wild-type PA and DNI (WT:DNI) showed greatly reduced K+ release relative to wild-type heptamer (Fig. 4B). To demonstrate the insertion of PA63 into liposomal membranes directly, we attached an environment-sensitive dye (NBD) to either of two sites within the protein and monitored its fluorescence emission intensity during pore formation. The intensity of NBD fluorescence at 544 nm increased upon a shift from a polar to a non-polar environment, and earlier we monitored insertion of various residues of the 14-strand β-barrel into membranes of Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells after replacing those residues with Cys and reacting the protein with a thiol-reactive form of NBD (21Qa'dan M. Christensen K.A. Zhang L. Roberts T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5492-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In that study, NBD attached to an introduced Cys at position 305 (facing the lipid bilayer) showed a strong increase in fluorescence, whereas at position 306 (facing the aqueous lumen) the fluorophore showed little change. In the current study we observed a strong increase of fluorescence intensity at pH 5.0 with NBD-PA(G305C) during pore formation but not with NBD-PA(N306C) (Fig. 4C). The increase seen with the labeled PA (G305C) was dependent on low pH, His-R2, and liposomes. These data correlate results in the LUV system with those in cells and support the β-barrel model of PA insertion. PA Bound to Liposomes via a His tag on Its C Terminus Mediates Efficient Pore Formation—To probe the role of the ANTXR2 VWA domain in this system, we compared attaching PA to liposomes via a ANTXR2 VWA bridge protein with attaching it directly via a His tag on the C terminus of PA. nPA-His and His-R2-complexed nPA showed approximately equal levels of binding to DOPC liposomes containing 8% DOGs-NTA-Ni (Fig. 5A) and similarly high levels of activity in promoting K+ release (Fig. 5B). Also, when attached to membranes by either mode, nPA gave greater activity than unbound nPA lacking His tag (Fig. 3A). nPA-His behaved similarly to PA lacking the His tag in terms of oligomerization and ANTXR2 binding (data not shown), and both had low activity in releasing K+ from DOPC liposomes lacking the Ni2+-chelating lipid (Fig. 5C). Because PA that was bound to liposomes directly via its C terminus was as active in pore formation as PA bound via ANTXR2 VWA bridge, His-R2 apparently functioned primarily as a membrane anchor in this system. R2 Lacking a His Tag Inhibits Aggregation of Heptameric PA in Solution and Facilitates Pore Formation—When we performed controls to test the possibility that R2 lacking a His tag might affect pore formation by PA prepore, we found that indeed it increased K+ release from liposomes (Fig. 6A). However, R2 did not bind to liposomes at pH 4–9 (data not shown), suggesting that, unlike His-R2, it did not mediate binding of PA to LUV. We therefore examined an alternative possibility; binding of R2 might slow the inactivation of heptameric PA63. We incubated the heptamer with excess R2 at pH 5.0 for various brief periods and then added the mixture to DOPC liposomes and monitored the kinetics of K+ release. As shown in Fig. 6B, in comparison with the data in Fig. 1, R2 significantly retarded the inactivation process. Also, we examined the effect of R2 on aggregation of the prepore by monitoring turbidity at 340 nm after lowering the pH from pH 8.5 to 5.0 (Fig. 6C). Although R2 did not significantly change the final level of aggregation, it caused a delay in the formation of aggregrates, on the order of minutes. Consistent with the known high affinity of R2 for PA, the maximal shift in kinetics was observed with a relatively small molar excess of the receptor domain. Bovine serum albumin at molar ratio of the protein to PA (8:1) did not affect the aggregation kinetics (data not shown). Many intracellularly acting toxins initially bind to a receptor on the surface of host cells and later translocate across the endosomal membrane under the influence of acidic pH. In some of these proteins (e.g. diphtheria toxin) the pH-dependent membrane insertion process has been studied extensively in model membranes devoid of receptors (27Boquet P. Eur. J.

Capiau C. Zanen J. Kayser G. Ruysschaert J.M. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the case of anthrax toxin, the PA prepore has been shown to form ionconductive pores (channels) in both planar phospholipid bilayers and liposomes in the absence of receptors, and much information about the properties of these pores has been obtained recently from studies in planar bilayers (24Krantz B.A. Melnyk R.A. Zhang S. Juris S.J. Lacy D.B. Wu Z. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Science. 2005; 309: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 33Krantz B.A. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although liposomes offer advantages over planar bilayers in addressing some aspects of pore formation and function, they have not been as useful in studying PA prepore insertion, in part because of the apparent inefficiency of insertion revealed in earlier studies (14Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1501-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).3 In the current study we have addressed this problem and developed ways to overcome it by binding PA to vesicles in advance of pore formation. Besides making liposomes a more useful system to study anthrax toxin, the results shed light on the role of receptors in toxin action. Within seconds after the pH was lowered to 5.0, the prepore converted in solution to an inactive form, lacking the ability to permeabilize DOPC LUV membranes to K+. Concurrently the heptameric PA63 complex became resistant to dissociation by SDS and fell out of solution, generating visible aggregates. Therefore, acidic pH triggered a conformational rearrangement in the prepore, yielding a short-lived intermediate that was competent to insert into membranes and then converted to an inactive form. The structures of the active and inactive forms are unknown. Conceivably the active form corresponds to the pore, containing a fully formed 14-strand β-barrel, as a transiently soluble intermediate, and the inactive form corresponds to aggregates of this form. However, the pathway and the end product(s) may be more complex. Regardless, the pathway leading to inactivation in solution clearly competes with the pathway leading to pore formation, and this can cause partitioning into membranes to be inefficient. In an attempt to rectify this problem, we sought ways to bind PA to the surface of LUV in advance of acidification. Availability of a full-length functional receptor was still a limiting factor, but the use of metal-chelating lipids in combination with a poly His-tagged receptor ecto-ligand-binding domain appeared to be an alternative. Incorporating a His-tagged poliovirus receptor into liposomes via nickel-chelating lipids was recently used to study non-enveloped virus cell entry (34Tuthill T.J. Bubeck D. Rowlands D.J. Hogle J.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Bubeck D. Filman D.J. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We used a similar approach, based on the availability of the purified PA-binding domain (VWA) of ANTXR2 and the ability to produce a His-tagged form of this protein efficiently in Escherichia coli. LUV doped with a Ni2+-chelating lipid could bind His-R2, and this protein in turn could serve as a receptor for monomeric PA or prepore. The interaction between monomeric PA and R2 shows a KD ∼ 0.2 nm, and because the prepore can bind seven copies of R2, its linkage to R2 on liposomes would be expected to be effectively irreversible. Although the KD for the interaction between hexa-His tag and Ni2+-NTA was about 1 μm (36Nieba L. Nieba-Axmann S.E. Persson A. Hamalainen M. Edebratt F. Hansson A. Lidholm J. Magnusson K. Karlsson A.F. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), in the present study the His-R2 binding to DOGs-NTA-Ni was optimized by using excess DOGs-NTA-Ni relative to His-R2, which allowed at least 90% His-R2 bind to liposomes (data not shown). In addition, when prepore was saturated with R2, the interaction of the entire complex with DOGs-NTA-Ni-containing membranes would be expected to be effectively irreversible because of the multi-point contact of the seven His-R2 molecules with the nickel-containing lipid. We showed that the efficiency of pore formation in doped LUV was strongly enhanced when PA was bound to vesicles via the His-R2 bridge protein, as judged by the kinetics of K+ release. The insertion half-time was on the order of several seconds, as measured by K+ release or enhancement of fluorescence of NBD at position 305 and was much more rapid than that observed with unbound PA. Thus the insertion was largely complete before the complex could proceed down the pathway to inactivation (if such a pathway is in fact operative with membrane-bound PA.) Consistent with observations in other systems, the binding to His-R2 shifted the pH threshold of conversion to the pore to a lower range (9Wigelsworth D.J. Krantz B.A. Christensen K.A. Lacy D.B.

S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); mutations in PA known to affect heptamerization or prepore-to-pore conversion inhibited pore formation in the predicted way (3Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7045-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Sellman B.R. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar); and membrane insertion by a fluorescently tagged form of PA gave results consistent with prior findings in cells and with the β-barrel model of pore formation (21Qa'dan M. Christensen K.A. Zhang L. Roberts T.M. Collier R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5492-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Also, binding of LFN-DTA was shown to depend on proteolytic activation of PA (3Mogridge J. Cunningham K. Lacy D.B. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7045-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As judged by these various criteria, doped DOPC LUV containing His-R2 as receptor represent a valid model of the membrane insertion process in vivo. An almost identical enhancement of pore formation was observed when PA was bound to doped LUV via a His tag appended to its C terminus. This implies that an important function of the PA receptor is to concentrate PA close to the surface of the membrane during prepore-to-pore conversion. Orientating the prepore with respect to the membrane is likely also to be important, but in our experiments binding either directly or via His-R2 occurred via the PA C-terminal domain 4, so the membrane-penetrating β-barrel would form on the surface of the prepore facing the membrane. Thus, our results do not discriminate between this and alternative orientations. Binding via the His-R2 bridge protein would place the prepore farther away (∼40 Å) from the membrane surface than binding via the C-terminal His tag on PA, but this did not diminish the efficiency of insertion. Furthermore, in the native ANTXR2 receptor there is an additional domain between the VWA domain and the transmembrane domain, so that ANTXR2-bound PA prepore is at an even greater distance from the membrane surface in vivo. The 14-strand β-barrel of the pore is predicted to be ∼100 Å long (38Nguyen T.L. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 22: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the transmembrane segment adjacent to the insertion tip, allowing a significant “reach” of prepore not immediately adjacent to the membrane surface. There is evidence in vivo that the receptor dissociates from the PA heptamer after conversion to the pore (37Rainey G.J. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and this would be consistent with the apparent insensitivity to the distance from the membrane at which the pH-dependent conformational transition to the pore occurs. The finding that the R2 retards conversion of the PA63 heptamer to an inactive form in solution is consistent with earlier results showing that the domain binds tightly to the prepore and lowers the pH threshold of the conformational transition to the pore by about one pH unit (10Lacy D.B. Wigelsworth D.J. Melnyk R.A. Harrison S.C. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13147-13151Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By binding to both domain 4 and domain 2 of PA, the ANTXR2 receptor serves as a molecular clamp, which inhibits the conformational transition of domain 2 to form the 14-strand β-barrel. Conversion of the unliganded PA prepore to the SDS-resistant pore conformation can occur even at neutral pH, and binding to the ANTXR1 receptor affects the pH threshold of this conversion to a lesser extent than ANTXR2 (37Rainey G.J. Wigelsworth D.J. Ryan P.L. Scobie H.M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results do not speak to the question of whether partitioning into the membrane of membrane-bound nPA varies significantly with small changes in the pH at which prepore-to-pore conversion occurs. The ability to bind PA to liposomes doped with metal-chelating lipids, as shown here, makes such vesicles useful tools to study this and other questions pertaining to the action of anthrax toxin.

https://openalex.org/W2109376993,"Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited disorder characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes. Although this disease is considered to be primarily a neurodegenerative disorder, many NPC patients suffer from liver disease. We have investigated alterations that occur in hepatic lipid homeostasis using primary hepatocytes isolated from NPC1-deficient mice. The cholesterol content of Npc1–/– hepatocytes was 5-fold higher than that of Npc1+/+ hepatocytes; phospholipids and cholesteryl esters also accumulated. In contrast, the triacylglycerol content of Npc1–/– hepatocytes was 50% lower than of Npc1+/+ hepatocytes. We hypothesized that the cholesterol sequestration induced by NPC1 deficiency might inhibit very low density lipoprotein secretion. However, this process was enhanced by NPC1 deficiency and the secreted particles were enriched in cholesteryl esters. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for these changes. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol in hepatocytes was increased by NPC1 deficiency and the amount of the mature form of sterol response element-binding protein-1 was also increased. These observations indicate that the enhanced secretion of lipoproteins from NPC1-deficient hepatocytes is due, at least in part, to increased lipid synthesis. Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is a fatal inherited disorder characterized by an accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes. Although this disease is considered to be primarily a neurodegenerative disorder, many NPC patients suffer from liver disease. We have investigated alterations that occur in hepatic lipid homeostasis using primary hepatocytes isolated from NPC1-deficient mice. The cholesterol content of Npc1–/– hepatocytes was 5-fold higher than that of Npc1+/+ hepatocytes; phospholipids and cholesteryl esters also accumulated. In contrast, the triacylglycerol content of Npc1–/– hepatocytes was 50% lower than of Npc1+/+ hepatocytes.

Individuals with this disease experience progressive neurodegeneration and premature death, typically during teenage years (1Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Patterson M.C. Scriver C.R.

The majority (∼95%) of cases of NPC disease result from mutations in the NPC1 gene (2Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G. Loftus S.K. Zhang D. Cummings C. Gu J. Rosenfeld M.A. Pavan W.J.

In NPC1-deficient cells, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol, as well as gangliosides and other lipids, accumulate in late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, although the exact function of NPC1 has not yet been established, NPC1 appears to be required for the egress of cholesterol and/or other lipids from the endosomal pathway (8Vanier M.T. Biochim.

A consequence of the sequestration of cholesterol in NPC1-deficient cells is that normal cholesterol homeostatic responses are impaired. In normal fibroblasts, when the cholesterol content increases, cholesterol biosynthesis is down-regulated and cholesterol esterification is stimulated (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). In NPC1-deficient fibroblasts, however, cholesterol becomes sequestered in late endosomes/lysosomes and the cholesterol homeostatic machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) fails to sense the increased level of cellular cholesterol. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis is inappropriately increased and the esterification of LDL-derived cholesterol is markedly decreased (15Liscum L. Faust J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17002-17008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition to the severe, progressive neurodegeneration in individuals with NPC disease, hepatomegaly and neonatal cholestasis occur in many NPC patients. A significant number of children with NPC disease die of liver failure within their first six months (17Kelly D.A. Portmann B. Mowat A.P. Sherlock S. Lake B.D. J.

Because the majority of cholesterol-containing LDLs are cleared from the circulation by the liver via receptor-mediated endocytosis (21Pittman R.C. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1577-1585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), NPC deficiency causes an accumulation of cholesterol in the livers of humans and mice to a greater extent than in any other tissue (22Xie C.

Investig. 1995; 95: 1124-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mice lacking functional NPC1 represent an excellent model for studying NPC disease because they exhibit liver dysfunction, including hepatomegaly and elevation of plasma alkaline phosphatase and aminotransferase levels, similar to those seen in infants with NPC disease (20Beltroy E.P. Richardson J.A. Horton J.D. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In light of these liver problems, we have investigated alterations in lipid metabolism that occur in primary hepatocytes isolated from NPC1-deficient mice. Cholesterol levels in Npc1–/– hepatocytes are markedly (∼5-fold) higher than in Npc1+/+ hepatocytes and the rates of cholesterol esterification and the synthesis of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are increased. Moreover, NPC1 deficiency increases the amount of the mature form of sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP-1) and enhances the secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) by hepatocytes. Materials—Hanks' solution, collagenase, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, tridecanoin standard for gas chromatography, phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii, and insulin were purchased from Sigma, as was the inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, Sandoz 58-035. Complete protease inhibitor tablets were from Roche. [3H]Glycerol (3 Ci/mmol), [14C]acetate (57 mCi/mmol), [2-14C]mevalonic acid lactone, [9,10-3H]oleic acid, and [methyl-3H]choline (75.7 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Biosciences. All chemicals used for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. Goat anti-human apolipoprotein (apo) B polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (San Diego, CA). Mouse anti-goat IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Pierce. The rabbit anti-rat phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase-2 polyclonal antibodies were generated in our laboratory (24Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-human CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) polyclonal antibodies (25Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. S. Jackowski (St. Jude Children's Research Institute, Memphis, TN). The rabbit anti-canine calnexin antibodies were purchased from StressGen (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The rabbit antibodies directed against human SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase was from Pierce. The chemiluminescent reagent used for immunoblotting was from Amersham Biosciences. Cholesterol, cholesteryl esters (CE), triacylglycerols (TG), PC, and sphingomyelin used as thin layer chromatography standards were either purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) or isolated in our laboratory from rat livers. BIOCOAT collagen-coated cell culture dishes (60 mm) and thin layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel G, 0.25 mm thickness) were from VWR (Mississauga, ON, Canada), as was the Infinity Cholesterol reagent and the Triacylglycerol reagent used for detection of lipids in the column eluate from fast protein liquid chromatography. All other chemicals and reagents were from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Culture of Primary Hepatocytes from Npc1-deficient Mice—Male mice (5 weeks old) were from a breeding colony of Balb/cNctr-NpcN/+ mice established at the University of Alberta from original breeding pairs obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were maintained under temperature-controlled conditions with a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle, and were supplied with a 9% fat diet (number 5001 from Purina LabDiet, Richmond, IN) and water ad libitum. Henceforth, mice homozygous or heterozygous for the Npc1 mutation are referred to as Npc1–/– and Npc1+/–, respectively, whereas wild-type mice are termed Npc1+/+. Because Npc1–/– mice do not produce offspring, Npc1+/– mice were used for breeding. The Npc1 genotype was determined from tail clippings by PCR analysis of genomic DNA using primers described previously (26Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For isolation of hepatocytes, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Somnotol (22 μl/50 g body weight). A mid-line incision was made, and Hanks' EGTA solution containing 1 mg/ml insulin was perfused through the portal vein until the liver was clear of blood. The upper and lower vena cava were tied and the perfusion was continued with Hanks' collagenase solution (100 units/ml) containing 1 mg/ml insulin until the liver became soft (∼3 min). The liver was removed, cut into pieces, transferred to Hanks' collagenase solution, and mixed until all clumps of tissue dispersed. The hepatocytes were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, then suspended in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on collagen-coated dishes (1 × 106 cells/ml). Cell viability (typically >90% for both Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– hepatocytes) was estimated by trypan blue exclusion. After hepatocytes had attached to the dish (3–4 h), the medium was removed and cells were incubated in medium lacking serum. Filipin Staining of Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated coverslips for 16 h then fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde. Phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% goat serum and 50 μg/ml filipin was added for 2 h at room temperature. Pictures were taken using a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence microscope (Leica, ON, Canada) with an excitation wavelength of 351 nm. Mass of Lipids in Hepatocytes and Culture Medium—Hepatocytes from one 60-mm culture dish were scraped into water (1 ml) and lipids were extracted (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar). The culture medium (2 ml) was also collected, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar). The amounts of TG, CE, and unesterified cholesterol were determined in hepatocyte lysates and in culture medium. After digestion of phospholipids with phospholipase C, tridecanoin (20 ng) was added as an internal standard. The mass of TG, cholesterol, and CE was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (26Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For measurement of the mass of phospholipids, lipids were extracted from an aliquot of liver homogenate (2 mg of protein) or culture medium (2 ml) (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar) and separated by thin layer chromatography in the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1, v/v). Bands corresponding to authentic PC and sphingomyelin were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine and spots were scraped from the plate. Amounts of PC and sphingomyelin were quantified by phosphorus analysis (28Zhou X. Arthur G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of VLDLs from Culture Medium and Measurement of Lipid Content—Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– hepatocytes were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of serum. Culture medium (1.3 ml) was collected and mixed with 0.7 g of KBr. The sample was placed in a 5.0-ml Quick-seal tube and overlaid with 3.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The samples were centrifuged at 416,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckmann VTi 90.0 rotor (29Kulinski A. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23916-23924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fractions containing high density lipoproteins, LDLs, and VLDLs were sequentially collected from the bottom of the tube. The density of each fraction was determined as the weight of 1.0 ml. Medium from 5 dishes of cells was combined. The mass of TG and CE was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. ApoB Content of Hepatocytes, Culture Medium, and Plasma—Hepatocytes from one 60-mm culture dish were scraped into 750 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, then 250 μl of buffer containing Tris-HCl (0.66 m, pH 7.4), NaCl (0.75 m), EDTA (25 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 mm), and Triton X-100 (5%, v/v) was added. Cellular extracts were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min, after which proteins in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with anti-human apoB antibodies (7.5 μl). Protein A-Sepharose (45 mg) was added and the sample was mixed end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The apoB-protein A complexes were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitation of secreted apoB, culture medium was centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris and anti-apoB antibodies were added to the supernatant. Equal amounts of protein in the immunoprecipitate were separated by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.4% SDS, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Proteins were immunoblotted with goat anti-human apoB antibodies and subsequently with anti-goat IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence. The amount of apoB was quantified by densitometric scanning of the blots and calculated as intensity of the band per mg of cell protein. The apoB content of plasma was compared in Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– mice that had been fasted for 16 h. Plasma (100 μl) was collected and lipoproteins were separated on the basis of density by ultracentrifugation on a KBr gradient (29Kulinski A. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23916-23924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ten fractions with densities ranging from 1.21 (fraction 10) to 1.006 g/ml (fraction 1) were collected. ApoB was immunoprecipitated from equal volumes of each fraction as described above, and proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. ApoB100 and apoB48 were analyzed by immunoblotting. Separation of Lipoproteins on the Basis of Size from Hepatocyte Culture Medium—Hepatocytes were isolated from livers of male 5-week-old Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– mice and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h. Culture medium from four, 100-mm culture dishes was combined and concentrated to a volume of 200 μl with an Amicon Ultra Concentrator (100,000 molecular weight cut-off from Millipore). Lipoproteins were separated on the basis of size by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Superose 6 column (30Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The amount of total cholesterol (i.e. unesterified cholesterol plus esterified cholesterol) and TG in the column eluate was measured with Infinity Cholesterol reagent or Triacylglycerol reagent, respectively. The elution time of the lipid reflects the size of the lipoprotein particles. Metabolic Labeling of PC, Cholesterol, CE, and TG—Hepatocytes were incubated for up to 3 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline. Alternatively, hepatocytes were incubated with [14C]acetate (20 μCi/ml), [3H]oleate (50 μCi/ml), [14C]mevalonic acid lactone (5 μCi/ml), or [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/ml), as indicated. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and lipids were extracted. PC was isolated by thin layer chromatography in the developing solvent chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (70:30:12:4:1, v/v). The band corresponding to authentic PC was visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine, then scraped from the plate and radioactivity was measured. Cholesterol, CE, and TG were isolated by thin layer chromatography with heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4, v/v) as developing solvent. Esterification of Cholesterol—Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– hepatocytes were incubated for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence of serum. The cells were then incubated with [3H]oleic acid (50 μCi/ml) bound to 163 mg/ml fatty acid-free albumin for up to 4 h. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were extracted (27Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar) then separated by thin layer chromatography in heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4, v/v) as developing solvent. Lipids were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapor and the band corresponding to CE was scraped from the plate for measurement of radioactivity. In control experiments, cholesterol esterification was assessed in human skin fibroblasts using the same protocol. Npc1+/+ fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Npc1–/– fibroblasts were from the Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The fibroblasts were grown to near confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, then cholesterol esterification was assessed as described above. In some experiments, cholesterol esterification was assessed in Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– hepatocytes by incubation of cells with [3H]oleate for 2 h in the presence or absence of Sandoz 58-035 (2 μg/ml), an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase. Immunoblotting of CTP:phosphocholine Cytidylyltransferase, Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase, Calnexin, SREBP-1, and SREBP-2—Homogenates of livers from Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– mice were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min to pellet membranes. Membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% skimmed milk, then incubated overnight with anti-CT antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) that recognize both CTα and CTβ; in hepatocytes the α isoform predominates. The membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:2,500). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Essentially the same procedure was used for immunoblotting of calnexin, SREBP-1, and SREBP-2, except that anti-calnexin antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5,000, and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:250. For immunoblotting of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, proteins in liver homogenates were separated by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 10% skimmed milk, then incubated overnight with anti-phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) (24Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:2,500). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Other Methods—The protein content of samples was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Statistical significance of difference was determined by the Student's t test and differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Accumulation of Lipids in NPC1-deficient Hepatocytes—The distribution of unesterified cholesterol in primary hepatocytes isolated from 5-week-old Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– mice was assessed by staining the cells with filipin (26Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Karten B. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4168-4175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), an agent that detects un-esterified cholesterol but not CE. Fluorescence microscopy of filipin-treated Npc1+/+ hepatocytes revealed that un-esterified cholesterol was localized mainly to the cell surface (Fig. 1A), whereas Npc1–/– hepatocytes showed an intense, punctate intracellular staining pattern, indicative of redistribution of unesterifed cholesterol (Fig. 1B). These filipin staining patterns are reminiscent of those seen in other types of Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– cells such as fibroblasts (32Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 33Roff C.F. Goldin E. Comly M.E. Blanchette-Mackie J. Cooney A. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. Am. J. Med.

Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and glial cells (34Karten B. Hayashi H. Francis G.A. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To establish the extent of unesterified cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-deficient hepatocytes, we measured the mass of cholesterol by gas-liquid chromatography. In Npc1–/– hepatocytes, the cholesterol content was ∼5-fold higher than in Npc1+/+ hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). Thus, in hepatocytes, as in other types of cells, lack of functional NPC1 causes a pronounced re-distribution and accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. It is noteworthy that in mouse hepatocytes NPC1 deficiency causes a much greater accumulation of cholesterol than in other types of cells such as fibroblasts (25–50% increase) (35Frolov A.

The amounts of PC (Fig. 2A), sphingomyelin (Fig. 2B), and CE (Fig. 2C) were significantly higher (by 48, 100, and 76%, respectively) in Npc1–/– hepatocytes than in Npc1+/+ hepatocytes. In contrast, the mass of cellular TG in Npc1–/– hepatocytes was 54% less (p < 0.001) than in wild-type hepatocytes (Fig. 2D). The cholesterol and CE content of livers of 5-week-old Npc1+/+ and Npc1–/– mice was also compared. The amount of unesterified cholesterol in NPC1-deficient livers was 5-fold higher than in wild-type livers (142.0 ± 24.9 versus 28.7 ± 3.9 μg/mg of protein and the amount of hepatic CE was not significantly changed by NPC1 deficiency (2.15 ± 1.41 versus 1.49 ± 0.33 μg/mg protein). NPC1 Deficiency in Hepatocytes Increases the Secretion of Unesterified Cholesterol, CE, and Phospholipids, but Not TG—An important function of hepatocytes is to provide lipids for lipoprotein secretion. The majority of lipids secreted by cultured primary hepatocytes are associated with VLDLs although small amounts of cholesterol, CE, PC, and sphingomyelin are also released into the medium as high density lipoproteins. PC, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin reside primarily on the surface monolayer of lipoprotein particles, whereas the neutral lipids TG and CE are in the core. The mass of cholesterol (Fig. 3A), PC (Fig. 3B), and sphingomyelin (Fig. 3C) secreted into the culture medium of NPC1-deficient hepatocytes was increased by NPC1 deficiency (by 117, 48, and 74%, respectively). In addition, the amount of CE in the culture medium of Npc1–/– hepatocytes was ∼50% (p < 0.008) higher than in the medium of Npc1+/+ hepatocytes (Fig. 3D). However, the mass of TG secreted was unchanged by NPC1 deficiency (Fig. 3E). These observations suggest that NPC1 deficiency in hepatocytes increases VLDL secretion. Furthermore, the data indicate that the composition of the neutral lipid core of the VLDLs might have been modifie"

In this paper, we present a mechanism by which GH eliminates age-dependent negative control of proliferation and increases transcription of liver-specific genes in livers of old mice. The reduced proliferative capacities of the liver of old animals are associated with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)-Brm complex, which inhibits E2F-dependent promoters. We found that a sequestration of C/EBPα into complexes with Brm leads to a weak interaction of C/EBPα with promoters of liver-specific genes, expression of which is reduced in old animals. Injection of either GH or the regulator of the amplitude of endogenous GH release, ghrelin, reduces the C/EBPα-Brm complex in livers of old mice, leading to a derepression of E2F targets, to increased interactions of C/EBPα with promoters of liver-specific genes, and to correction of their expression. GH-dependent elimination of the complex is mediated by the inhibition of cyclin D3-CDK4 activity and by elevation of a phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylates C/EBPα and dissociates the complex.

Two members of C/EBP family, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, are involved in molecular pathways that cause an aging phenotype in tissue culture systems and in the liver (1Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A.

C/EBPα and C/EBPβ interact with the promoters of liver-specific genes and activate expression of corresponding proteins. In addition to activation of liver-specific promoters, C/EBPα plays a key role in the inhibition of liver proliferation (5Johnson P.F. J.

Examination of C/EBPα knock-out mice showed that C/EBPα is required for the inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation in newborn animals and after birth (7Timchenko N.A. Harris H.A. Wilde M. Bilyeu T.A. Burgess-Beusse B.L. Finegold M.J. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1977; 17: 7353-7361Crossref Google Scholar). Biological functions of C/EBPα during prenatal development of the liver depend on the cell type in which C/EBPα is expressed. For example, examination of proliferation in prenatal livers of C/EBP knockout mice at day 17 of gestation revealed that the deletion of C/EBPα causes a 3.5-fold increase of proliferation in hepatocytes, whereas billiarly epithelial cells do not show significant change in the rate of proliferation (9Yamasaki H.

C/EBPα is also required for the inhibition of liver growth in adult mice. Experimental work from Wang's group (6Tan E.H. Hooi S.C. Laban M. Wong E. Ponniah A.W. Wang N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10330-10337Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) demonstrated that growth-inhibitory activity of C/EBPα in adult animals protects livers from development of tumors and that this activity is mediated by inhibiting CDK2 and by an induction of protein levels of p21 in nuclei. Taken together, these studies revealed that liver-specific mechanisms of C/EBPα growth arrest in young animals involve direct interactions of C/EBPα with cell cycle-dependent kinases (10Wang G.-L.

For example, deletion of C/EBPα in adult animals leads to the development of an aging phenotype in the liver (12Inoue S. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzales F.J. J. Biol.

Consistent with these findings, we and others have observed that aging changes pathways of C/EBPα growth arrest in liver by recruitment of C/EBPα into complexes with Brm, Rb, and E2F, which inhibit transcription of E2F targets (1Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 2Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Wagers A.J. Girma E.R. Weisman I.L. Rando T.A.

Recently, Rando's group (2Conboy I.M. Conboy M.J. Wagers A.J. Girma E.R. Weisman I.L. Rando T.A. Nature. 2005; 4: 760-764Crossref Scopus (1610) Google Scholar) showed that exposure of old mice to a young systemic environment by parabiosis restored proliferative capacity of livers in old mice. This restoration involved inhibition of the age-specific C/EBPα-Brm complex. One of the components of the young systemic environment is growth hormone. The amplitude of episodic growth hormone (GH) release declines during aging, and the impaired proliferative potential of old livers following partial hepatectomy (PH) can be corrected by administration of GH (16Krupczak-Hollis K. Wang X. Dennewitz M.B. Costa R.H. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although GH treatment results in increased insulin-like growth factor-1 production by the liver, it has been shown that the effects of GH on proliferation following PH are directly induced by GH and not indirectly through insulin-like growth factor-1 (17Pennisi P.A. Kopchick J.J. Thorgeirsson S. LeRoith D. Yakar S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 4748-4755Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The positive role of GH in the regulation of liver proliferation has been demonstrated by several studies, but the molecular pathways by which GH promotes proliferation are not well understood.In this paper, we investigated the effects of GH on the C/EBPα-Brm complex and on the expression of liver-specific genes. In livers of old mice, the major portion of C/EBPα is associated with Brm and located on E2F-dependent promoters, where the complex represses transcription of cell cycle genes, such as c-Myc and FoxM1B. The sequestration of C/EBPα into these complexes leads to a significant reduction of free C/EBPα capable of activating liver-specific promoters. Particularly, the interactions of C/EBPα with PEPCK and HNF6 promoters are reduced in livers of old mice, which correlate with a reduction of PEPCK transcription. We have found that GH eliminates the C/EBPα-Brm complex by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that involves alterations of at least two pathways: activation of PI3K-Akt-PP2A and a reduction of protein levels of cyclin D3, leading to a reduced activity of CDK4. The GH-mediated elimination of the complex leads to the derepression of E2F targets, to an increased association of C/EBPα with HNF6 and PEPCK promoters, and to correction of PEPCK expression. Ghrelin treatment of old mice, which provides a more physiological approach to GH replacement during aging, also restores the young liver phenotype in old mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Antibodies to cyclins D1, D2, and D3 and C/EBPα (14AA and N19); CDK6 and CDK4 (C-22); CDK2 (M2); Brm and Rb (C-15); HNF6 (H-100); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (H-98); and glucokinase (H-88) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to PP2A were from Signal Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies to PEPCK and Glycogen Synthase were from Cayman Chemical Co. and Chemicon International, respectively.Animals and Growth Hormone Studies—Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine (protocol AN-1439). In this paper, we have used young (4-6-month-old) and old (22-24-month-old) mice. Examination of C/EBPα-CDK and C/EBPα-Brm complexes was performed with five or six animals of each age group. Data for expression of liver-specific mRNAs and proteins in livers of young and old mice were obtained with 5-9 animals of each age group. Mouse recombinant growth hormone or ghrelin (1 mg/kg) was injected into old animals subcutaneously twice a day (at 8:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m.) for 7 days. GH was purchased from the National Hormone and Peptide Program, and physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) was used as vehicle for GH and ghrelin and as the control. Twice a day injections provides relatively stable circulating GH levels during the whole time period. Under these conditions, injection of ghrelin causes biologically relevant release of GH (18Smith R.G. Van der Ploeg L.H. Howard A.D. Feighner S.D. Cheng K. Hickey G.J. Wyvratt M.J. Fisher M.H.

Examination of the C/EBPα-Brm complex, protein levels, and phosphorylation isoforms of C/EBPα were performed as described below. Data represent studies of four GH-treated, four ghrelin-treated, and four control animals.Protein Isolation and Western Blotting—Nuclear extracts were isolated as described in previous papers (1Iakova P.

Proteins (50-100 μg) were added on gradient (4-20% or 8-16%) poly-acrylamide gel, transferred on the membrane, and probed with antibodies to proteins of interest. To verify protein loading, each filter was reprobed with β-actin and then stained with Coomassie Blue. Levels of protein expression were calculated as ratios to β-actin.Gel Filtration Analysis of Protein-Protein Complexes in Mouse Liver—The detailed procedure for the analysis of protein-protein complexes is described in our previous papers (1Iakova P.

Locations of the proteins within gel filtration factions and C/EBPα complexes were examined by Western blotting and co-IP assays.Gel Shift Assay—Examination of the interaction of E2F-Rb complexes with the FoxM1B promoter was performed as described in our previous papers (1Iakova P.

To confirm data of the IP-Western blot with Ser(P)193 Abs, we have also used a two-dimensional Western assay as described in our previous papers (4Wang G.-L. Shi X. Salisbury E. Sun Y. Albrecht J.H.

The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The real time PCRs contain 1× Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR master Mix (Stratagene), 200 nm each primer, 5% Me2SO, 1× ROX dye (Invitrogen), and synthesized cDNA. PCR amplification was performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate for each sample on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Bio-systems). The relative expression of PEPCK was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The sequences of PCR primers are as follows: PEPCK, 5′-TCCTGGCACCTCAGTGAAGACAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCCTTCCGGAACCAGTTGACAT-3′ (reverse), producing a 554-bp fragment; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGGGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGA-3′ (reverse), producing a 382-bp fragment.Coimmunoprecipitation—C/EBPα was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies (14AA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the presence of Rb, Brm, E2F4, and C/EBPα IPs was examined by Western blotting with monoclonal antibodies to the mentioned proteins.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif). The chromatin solutions were isolated from livers of young and old animals, and DNA was sheared by enzymatic digestion according to the instruction manual. The size of DNA fragments produced averaged between 500 and 1000 bp in length. Antibodies against C/EBPα, E2F1, E2F4, and Rb were added to each aliquot of precleared chromatin and incubated overnight. Protein G beads were added and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After reversing the cross-linking, DNA was isolated and used for PCRs with primers specific for E2F binding sites within the c-Myc promoter and hydroxysteroid transferase (1Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and FoxM1B promoter (see Fig. 5) as well as with primers to C/EBPα binding sites within the PEPCK and HNF6 promoters. The sequences of the primers for these promoters are as follows: PEPCK forward, 5′-GGCCTCCCAACATTCATTAAC-3′; PEPCK reverse, 5′-GTAGCCCGCCCTCCTTGCTTTAA-3′; HNF6 forward, 5′-GCTCGAGCTGGCGGGCGGCACAGGC-3′; HNF6 reverse, 5′-AGGAGTCCAGTCTTCACATCGGCTG-3′. As a control for the appropriate shearing of DNA, we have used primers for a region ∼1.5 kb upstream of the C/EBP site in each promoter. The sequences of these primers are as follows: PEPCK-NP1-F, 5′-AACCAACTGGCCCTAACTCACAGA-3′; PEPCK-NP2-R, 5′-GCTGCAGTCCAGCTAATGCAACAA-3′; HNF-NP1-F, 5′-AGGCAGGCACTTGGGTTAAGAGAT-3′; HNF-NP2, 5′-AGAGCCTTGTCTGCTTAGGTGCTT-3′. PCR mixtures were amplified for 1 cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, annealing temperature for primers (62 °C) for 5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. Then PCR mixtures were amplified for 34 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis or by 4% PAGE.Kinase Assay—Conditions for in vitro kinase assays are described in our previous publications (10Wang G.-L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A.L. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol.

Briefly, baculovirus-expressed purified CDK4-cyclin D1 and CDK6-cyclin D3 complexes or CDK4/CDK6/cyclin D3 IPs were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-Rb or glutathione S-transferase-C/EBPα substrates in the kinase reactions with [γ-32P]ATP.RESULTSSequestration of C/EBPα into Complexes with Brm Reduces Association of C/EBPα with PEPCK and HNF6 Promoters in Livers of Old Mice—A number of recent publications revealed that C/EBPα displays its functions via formation of multiple protein-protein complexes. Accordingly, we performed a detailed examination of the amounts of C/EBPα in protein-protein complexes in livers of young and old mice. In livers of young animals, C/EBPα forms complexes with CDK2 and CDK4 (11Wang H. Iakova P. Wilde M. Welm A.L. Goode T. Roesler W.J. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the relative amounts of C/EBPα complexes with CDKs and free C/EBPα using size exclusion chromatography/Co-IP. After separation of C/EBPα and C/EBPα-CDK complexes on the SEC450 column, CDK2 and CDK4 were simultaneously precipitated from each fraction, and C/EBPα was examined in CDK IPs and in supernatants. As seen in Fig. 1A, C/EBPα is observed in CDK complexes and in supernatant. Densitometric calculations demonstrated that 20-25% of C/EBPα is in complexes containing CDKs, whereas 75-80% of C/EBPα is CDK-free and is observed in the supernatant.FIGURE 1The sequestration of C/EBPα into C/EBPα-Brm complexes reduces amounts of free C/EBPα and decreases association of C/EBPα with PEPCK and HNF6 promoters. A, determination of amounts of CDK-free C/EBPα and C/EBPα within complexes with CDK2 and CDK4 in livers of young mice. Top (Western blot), nuclear proteins from livers of young mice were separated by chromatography on SEC450 column. Locations of C/EBPα and CDK2 within fractions were determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Bottom, CDK2/4 were simultaneously immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies from each fraction, and C/EBPα was examined in CDK2/CDK4 IPs and in supernatants. Coomassie stain shows IgG on the filter with CDK2/4 IPs. Amounts of C/EBPα in the CDK2/CDK4 IPs and supernatants were calculated by densitometry as ratios to total signals of C/EBPα. B, calculations of amounts of free C/EBPα and C/EBPα in complexes with Brm in livers of old mice. Nuclear proteins from livers of old mice were separated by size exclusion chromatography, and the locations of Brm and C/EBPα were determined by Western blotting. Brm was immunoprecipitated from the fractions, and C/EBPα was examined in Brm IPs and in supernatants as described above. C, occupation of c-Myc, HNF6, and PEPCK promoters by C/EBPα in livers of young and old mice was examined by ChIP analysis. E2F1, E2F4, C/EBPα, and Rb were immunoprecipitated from chromatin solutions, and the IPs were examined by PCR with primers specific to E2F region of the c-Myc promoter and to C/EBP sites on HNF6, PEPCK, and hydroxysteroid transferase promoters. Ag, agarose mock control. D, the occupation of the PEPCK and hydroxysteroid transferase promoters by C/EBPα in livers of young and old mice determined by a quantitative PCR.

After fractionation on a SEC450 column, Brm was immunoprecipitated from each fraction, and the amount of C/EBPα in IPs and in supernatants was determined by Western blotting. Consistent with previous studies, C/EBPα-Brm complex was observed in the high Mr region of gel filtration. Surprisingly, no C/EBPα was observed in supernatants after precipitation of Brm. Three independent experiments with protein extracts from livers of three old mice reproducibly showed no or very little C/EBPα in supernatants of the gel filtration fractions following immunoprecipitation of Brm complexes. Calculations of the amount of C/EBPα showed that around 94-95% of C/EBPα is associated with Brm within the high Mr C/EBPα-Brm complex. Interestingly, the co-IP assay detected a small portion of C/EBPα (5-6%) in Brm IPs from gel filtration fractions with a molecular mass around 200 kDa. We suggest that this complex consists of C/EBPα and Brm only and might be a result of partial dissociation of the high Mr C/EBPα-Rb-E2F4-Brm complex.We next examined interaction of C/EBPα with E2F-dependent promoters (as a component of the C/EBPα-Brm complex) and the interactions of C/EBPα with PEPCK and HNF6 promoters in livers from old mice. It has been previously shown that C/EBPα binds directly to the PEPCK and HNF6 promoters (12Inoue S. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzales F.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1686-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). E2F1, E2F4, C/EBPα, and Rb were immunoprecipitated from chromatin solutions isolated from livers of young and old mice, and these IPs were used in PCRs with primers to c-Myc (E2F-dependent), HNF6, and PEPCK (C/EBP-dependent) promoters. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 1C. In agreement with previous observations, C/EBPα is not detectable on the c-Myc promoter in young livers, but in old liver it is associated with the E2F site of the c-Myc promoter as a component of the C/EBPα-Rb-E2F4-Brm complex. Examination of these IPs with primers to the HNF6 and PEPCK promoters showed that only C/EBPα is associated with these promoters in livers of young mice. A weak association of Rb was also observed on the HNF6 promoter in livers from young mice. These data revealed that the C/EBPα-Brm complex does not interact with PEPCK and HNF6 promoters in aging liver. Examination of C/EBPα complexes in livers from old mice by ChIP assays showed markedly different results. Within the sensitivity of our assays, we could not detect interactions of C/EBPα with HNF6 promoter in livers from old mice. Although C/EBPα is detected on the PEPCK promoter in livers from old mice after 35 PCR cycles, a quantitative examination of the amounts of C/EBPα showed a significant difference. The PCR product of the PEPCK promoter is detected after 22-24 PCR cycles in C/EBPα IPs from livers of young mice, whereas detection of the PEPCK promoter in C/EBPα IPs from livers of old animals requires up to 28-30 cycles (Fig. 1D). To verify the quality of chip protocol, we have examined the association of C/EBPα complexes with hydroxysteroid transferase promoter. This promoter has been previously shown to interact with E2F1 and C/EBPα independently of E2F-Rb complexes (21Wells J. Graveel C.R. Bartley S.M. Nadore S.J. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and age of mice (1Iakova P. Awad S.S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1, C and D, the occupation of this promoter by E2F1 and C/EBPα is not altered in livers of old mice. Taken together, the ChIP results for the HNF6 and PEPCK promoters indicate that the interaction of C/EBPα with these promoters is reduced in livers from old mice, presumably due to sequestration of C/EBPα into the C/EBPα-Brm complex.Expression of Transcriptional Targets of C/EBPα in Old Livers—Given the reduced interaction of C/EBPα with promoters of HNF6 and PEPCK genes, we examined their expression in young and old livers. In addition to these proteins, we analyzed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and glucokinase, since C/EBPα regulates their expression through direct binding to the promoters (13Yang J. Croniger C.M. Lekstrom-Himes J. Zhang P. Fanyus M. Tenen D.G. Darlington G.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38689-38699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Western blotting showed that protein levels of glucokinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α are not changed; however, protein levels of PEPCK are significantly reduced in old livers (Fig. 2). Examination of transcripts for these direct targets of C/EBPα showed that levels of PEPCK mRNA are also reduced to 25-30% compared with levels observed in livers of young mice. Since C/EBPα is a positive regulator of the PEPCK promoter (12Inoue S. Inoue J. Lambert G. Yim S.H. Gonzales F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44740-44748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Yang J. Croniger C.M. Lekstrom-Himes J. Zhang P. Fanyus M. Tenen D.G. Darlington G.J. Hanson R.W. J.

To further test this hypothesis, we have examined whether elimination of the C/EBPα-Brm complex in livers of old mice corrects expression of direct targets of C/EBPα.FIGURE 2Protein and mRNA levels of PEPCK are reduced in livers of old mice.

In addition to nucleotide sequence, bioinformatic analysis has revealed a conservation of critical functional motifs among the human L2DTL, mouse L2dtl, and Drosophila l(2)dtl proteins. The function of the L2DTL protein in the development of mammalian embryos was studied using targeted disruption of the L2dtl gene in mice. The knock-out resulted in early embryonic lethality. L2dtl-/- embryos were deformed and terminated development at the 4–8-cell stage. Microinjection of a small interfering RNA (siRNA) vector (siRNA-L2dtl) into the two-cell stage nuclei of wild-type mouse embryos led to cell cycle progression failure, termination of cell division, and, eventually, embryonic death during the preimplantation stage. Morphological studies of the embryos 54 h after injection showed fragmentation of mitotic chromosomes and chromosomal lagging, hallmarks of mitotic catastrophe. The siRNA-L2dtl-treated embryos eventually lysed and failed to develop into blastocysts after 72 h of in vitro culturing. However, the embryos developed normally after they were microinjected into one nucleus of the two-celled embryos. The siRNA studies in HeLa cells showed that L2dtl protein depletion results in multinucleation and down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and PTTG1/securin, which might partially explain the mitotic catastrophe observed in L2dtl-depleted mouse embryos. Based on these findings, we conclude that L2dtl gene expression is essential for very early mouse embryonic development. l(2)dtl (lethal (2) denticleless), is an embryonic lethal homozygous mutation initially identified in Drosophila melanogaster that produces embryos that lack ventral denticle belts.

Based on these findings, we conclude that L2dtl gene expression is essential for very early mouse embryonic development. The l(2)dtl (lethal (2) denticleless) gene in Drosophila melanogaster encodes a unique 83-kDa protein that is up-regulated under heat shock conditions (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Neubauer M. Debes A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Drosophila l(2)dtl shares common features with HSP90 family members, including protein expression pattern, structure of the promoter region, and mRNA expression throughout development in a wild-type Dm strain (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Neubauer M. Debes A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Homozygous mutations of l(2)dtl result in the absence of ventral denticle belts and embryonic lethality in Drosophila, hence the name of this gene (1Kurzik-Dumke U. Neubauer M. Debes A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). L2DTL (GenBank™ accession number AF195765), the human ortholog of Drosophila l(2)dtl, was recently shown to encode a nuclear matrix-associated protein that is down-regulated during the retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells. Hence, human L2DTL is also known as ramp (retinoid acid-regulated nuclear matrix-associated protein) (2Cheung W.M. Chu A.H. Chu P.W. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17083-17091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In humans, L2DTL is more highly expressed in the fetal tissues of the brain, lung, liver, and kidney than in normal adult tissues, suggesting a specific role during embryogenesis (2Cheung W.M. Chu A.H. Chu P.W. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17083-17091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial characterization of L2DTL protein in NT2 cells shows that it is an active participant in cell proliferation (2Cheung W.M. Chu A.H. Chu P.W. Ip N.Y. J. Biol.

Overexpression of L2DTL mRNA in unifocal primary HCC is now associated with larger tumor size, high grade, and high stage HCC and poorer survival, highlighting the potential role of L2DTL in HCC progression. 4H.-W. Pan, H.-Y. Chou, S.-H. Liu, S.-Y. Peng, C.-L. Liu, and H.-C. Hsu (2006) Cell Cycle, in press. Despite these observations, the physiological function of L2DTL, particularly its role in embryogenesis, has not been resolved. Our bioinformatic analysis 5C.-L. Liu, I.-S. Yu, H.-W. Pan, S.-W. Lin, and H.-C. Hsu, unpublished results. showed that the amino acid sequence of human L2DTL is 89% homologous to mouse L2dtl (GenBank™ accession number NM-029766) and 25% homologous to Drosophila l(2)dtl (GenBank™ accession number X83414). Although the human and mouse genes have a unique sequence at the carboxyl terminus that is not present in the Drosophila counterpart, all of the other major functional motifs, such as WD repeats, a nuclear localization signal, a D-box, a KEN-box, and PEST sequences, are conserved. The goal of this study was to investigate the physiological roles of L2dtl, an apparent ortholog of l(2)dtl, in embryonic mouse development. Homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells was used to generate L2dtl knock-out mice. Initial breeding and characterization revealed the embryonic lethality of L2dtl null mice. The development of L2dtl null embryos ceased at the 4–8-cell stage. A similar phenomenon was observed in two-cell stage embryos using siRNA knockdown of the L2dtl transcript. The results indicate that L2dtl is required for early embryonic development in mice. Computer Analysis of the Mouse L2dtl Gene—The genomic sequence of L2dtl was obtained from strain 129 in the Celera mouse data base. The sequence revealed a possible L2dtl gene with several partially unidentified sequences and ambiguous exon-intron boundaries. The sequence gaps within possible exons were completed by sequencing the 2.4-kb full-length L2dtl cDNA, which was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA extracted from fetal liver extracts. The identity of the 2.4-kb sequences was confirmed by comparing the sequences to the GenBank™ mouse L2dtl reference (accession number NM-029766). The 2.4-kb sequence was further analyzed using ELM (available on the World Wide Web at elm.eu.org/), SMART (available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), PSORT (available on the World Wide Web at www.psort.org/), and PESTfind (available on the World Wide Web at www.at.embnet.org/embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/) software programs to deduce amino acid sequence and functional domains. Semiquantitative RT-PCR Measurements—Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect relative RNA quantities as described previously (14Xie P. Cheung W.M. Ip F.C. Ip N.Y. Leung M.F. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). After treatment with DNase I, total RNA was transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. The primer pairs were 5′-AACATTATGATCTGGGACACCAGG-3′ and 5′-ATCACCTGGTTTCTCCTCTAGG-3′ for L2dtl and 5′-GACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′ for Gapdh. For each gene, the number of PCR cycles was optimized to detect differences in mRNA amounts: 30 cycles for Gapdh and 35 cycles for L2dtl. Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 95 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C using Taq polymerase (BerTag, DCB, Taipei, Taiwan). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Disruption of L2DTL in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells—A 10-kb L2dtl genomic DNA fragment coding for exons 1–5 was isolated from a BAC clone harboring 100 kb of 129/Sv genomic DNA (high density mouse BAC colony membrane, ResGen; Invitrogen) and inserted into pBR322 by gap repair (15Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The two chimeric primers used to generate a retrieval vector were (5′-TAGTGGCTTTTATCCTGGCTTCTAGTGTTACAGTTAGCTGAGTTGGAAACTGCGGCCGCgatacgcgagcgaacgtga-3′ and 5′-TGCGAGACTGTCAATTGCGCGTTCTAAAGCAGGTTCCATGTGGATGAGAACAGTCGACttcttagacgtcaggtggcac-3′). The 5′ ends of each primer contained 51 nucleotides of sequence (capital letters) homologous to each of the two ends of the L2dtl region to be subcloned. At the 3′ ends were 19–21 nucleotides (italicized letters) homologous to pBR322. The PCR-derived vector with a pBR322 backbone was transformed into EL350 (15Lee E.C. Yu D. Martinez de Velasco J. Tessarollo L. Swing D.A. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Retrieval of the 10-kb L2dtl genomic sequence was dependent on the occurrence of homologous recombination between the 51 nucleotides at the free ends of the linear pBR322 vector and the homologous L2dtl sequences carried on the BAC. The 10-kb genomic fragment was used to generate a targeting vector based on pKO-loxP (16Yadav N. Lee J. Kim J. Shen J. Hu M.C. Aldaz C.M. Bedford M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The knock-out strategy was to delete half of the L2dtl exon 1 (Fig. 2A). The 2.0-kb XbaI-SepI fragment (short arm) and 4.8-kb SmaI-HindIII fragment (long arm) were rendered blunt, ligated to appropriate linkers, and inserted into the pKO-loxP targeting vector at the unique XhoI and KpnI sites. The resultant targeting construct was then linearized by AscI digestion and used for transfection of the R1 ES cell line (a generous gift from A. Nagy, ES Core Facility, Ontario, Canada) (17Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) by electroporation as previously described (18Colucci-Guyon E. Portier M.M. Dunia I. Paulin D. Pournin S. Babinet C. Cell. 1994; 79: 679-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). G418 (2 μm) and gancyclovir (10 μm) were used for transformant selection. Surviving cell colonies were isolated, established as clones, and genotyped by Southern blotting to ensure that homologous recombination had taken place (19Yu I.S. Chen H.J. Lee Y.S. Huang P.H. Lin S.R. Tsai T.W. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Southern Blot Analysis—To genotype ES cell lines and identify targeted clones, 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with PstI, separated in a 0.5% agarose gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, blotted onto a nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with a 360-bp PCR fragment that hybridized in an upstream portion of the targeted region of L2dtl. The 3′ probe, a 0.3-kb HindIII-NcoI fragment, hybridized to a downstream portion of the targeted region near exon 2. Generation and Genotyping of L2dtl-deficient Mice—The correctly targeted ES cell clones were subsequently introduced into blastocysts of C57BL/6J mice by microinjection using a previously described technique (19Yu I.S. Chen H.J. Lee Y.S. Huang P.H. Lin S.R. Tsai T.W. Lin S.W. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 84: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice were bred with wild-type C57BL/6J mice to obtain heterozygous (F1) mice, which were intercrossed to generate F2 mice. To geno-type F1 and F2 weaned pups, genomic DNA was extracted from ∼0.5 cm of mouse tail and analyzed by PCR. The oligonucleo-tide primer pGKPD520 (5′-ACTGCCTTGGGAAAAGCGCCT-3′) hybridized only to the L2dtl knock-out allele, primer DE1F (5′-TGAGGAACGGTGAGTAACGGC-3′) hybridized only to the wild-type allele, and primer E1R (5′-TGGCGCCTTAAGATTGAGTTC-3′) hybridized to both the wild-type and L2dtl knock-out alleles (Fig. 1D). Primers pGKPD and E1R amplified a 400-bp fragment from the L2DTL knock-out allele, and primers DE1F and E1R produced a 400-bp fragment from the wild-type allele. Briefly, in a 50-μl reaction volume, 500 ng of genomic DNA and 20 pmol of each primer (pGKPD, DE1F, and E1R) were amplified in PCR buffer supplemented with 1.5 mm MgCl2, a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (BerTaq). The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C; and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Ten microliters of each reaction mixture was separated on a 1.0% agarose gel in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Embryo genotyping at 8.5, 10.5, and 12.5 days postcoitum (dpc) was performed by PCR analysis of DNA taken from either the yolk sac or the whole embryo. Tissues were digested overnight in 600 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, and 200 μg of proteinase K) at 55 °C. DNA was purified in a protein precipitation solution followed by isopropyl alcohol precipitation and dissolved in 50 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The purified DNA (0.5 μg) was used for PCR as described above. Timed Pregnancies—To generate timed pregnancies, L2dtl+/- females received an intraperitoneal injection of serum gonadotropin from a pregnant mare (5 IU/animal; Sigma), followed 48 h later by human chorionic gonadotropin (5 IU/animal; Sigma). These mice were then allowed to mate with L2dtl+/- males. The males were removed the next morning, and the females were examined for the presence of vaginal plugs. Plugged females were sacrificed at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 8.5, 10.5, and 12.5 dpc to isolate embryos, which were then genotyped by PCR as described above (for E8.5, E10.5, and E12.5) and below (for E1.5, E2.5, and E3.5). Genotyping of Preimplantation Stage Embryos—Nested PCR was used to genotype E0.5, E1.5, E2.5, and E3.5 embryos. Individual embryos (or a single cell) (20Roers A. Montesinos-Rongen M. Hansmann M.L. Rajewsky K. Kuppers R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2424-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were immersed in 5 μlof alkaline lysis buffer to lyse the embryo (or cell), after which 5 μl of neutralization buffer was added before storage at -70 °C until the following PCR. The first round of amplification was carried out using the “HotStarTag Master Mix” kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the first round, primers were mixed with PGKPD460 (2Cheung W.M. Chu A.H. Chu P.W. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17083-17091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (5′-CAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAGCGC-3′), E1F (5′-TCTTAGTGGCGGGAGTTGGAG-3′), and E1R. An initial step at 95 °C for 15 min was followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. For the second round of amplification, 5 μlofthe first round reaction mixture was added to two separate reaction mixes, each containing two different internal primers for the wild-type and knock-out alleles. The wild-type primers were second E1F (5′-TTGTGGAGGGTGCAGACGGCG-3′) and second E1R (5′-ATGCGCGCTGGTGCACAACGA-3′), whereas the knock-out allele primers were PGKPD520 and second E1R. Second round reactions were performed in a 50-μl reaction volume with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each dNTP, 150 nm each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The cycling program consisted of 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. Construction of the siRNA Expression Vector—The mouse U6 promoter used in the siRNA expression vector was obtained by PCR from mouse genomic DNA. The siRNA-L2dtl target sequence, 5′-AAATCTGGCGCTTGAATAGAG-3′, was sub-cloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroO vector (BD Biosciences Clontech), and the construct was designated siRNA-L2dtl. The DNA sequence of the construct was confirmed by sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pSIREN-RetroQ-Luc vector (luciferase siRNA target; BD Biosciences Clontech) was used as a negative control, and injection buffer was used as the mock injection control. The siRNA vectors were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen), purified by centrifugation at 13,200 × g for 10 min, and stored in the injection buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA) at -20 °C until used. Embryo Collection, Microinjection, and Culturing for siRNA Analysis—Mouse embryos were obtained from FVB superovulated female mice mated with FVB males. The female mice (∼3–4 weeks old) were superovulated and mated as described above. Fertilized two-cell stage embryos were collected from the mated females 36–38 h after injection of hCG and cultured in KSOM (Chemicon, Temecula, Canada) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Culture conditions and media have been described in detail elsewhere (21Lawitts J.A. Biggers J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 22Rinaudo P. Schultz R.M. Reproduction. 2004; 128: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The siRNA vector was diluted in injection buffer to a final concentration of 4 and 8 ng/μl. An appropriate amount of siRNA vector was microinjected into the two nuclei (23Haraguchi S. Saga Y. Naito K. Inoue H. Seto A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2004; 68: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or one nucleus of the two-cell embryos. Embryos microinjected with the same volume of siRNA vector only or injection buffer only were used as sham controls. All microinjections were performed under a Leica inverted microscope with a micromanipulator (Leica Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) using an automated Eppendorf microinjector (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) and defined injection needles (Eppendorf AG). In subsequent experiments, a final concentration of 4 ng/μl of the siRNA vector was used unless otherwise stated. All injected embryos were allowed to develop to the blastocyst stage in culture. The growth patterns of embryos were microscopically examined and photographed. Embryonic Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Three or five embryos were collected in 10 μl of RNase-free H2O and 10 μlof5× PCR buffer and stored at -80 °C. The one-step RT-PCR was carried out in the same reaction tube in 1× Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR buffer, a 400 μm concentration of each dNTP, 1× Qiagen Q-Solution, 0.6 μm each primer, and 5 units of HotStart Taq polymerase mix. The initial RT step was 50 °C for 30 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 10 min. For the second round of amplification, 5 μl of the first round reaction mixture was added to two separate reaction mixtures, each containing two different L2dtl and Gapdh internal primers. Second round reactions were performed in a 50-μl reaction volume with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm each dNTP, 150 nm each primer, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The cycling program consisted of 26 cycles of 95 °C for 2 min, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a 10-min incubation at 72 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Embryos treated with siRNA and cultured to the blastocyst stage were washed five times in bovine serum albumin-free M2 medium (Sigma). Fifteen embryos were collected in 25 μlof1× SDS sample buffer. After heat denaturation, the protein samples were stored at -80 °C until used. The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Milli-pore), blocked with 5% milk in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) containing 0.1% Tween 20, and probed with anti-L2DTL antibody4 and anti-Hsp90 antibody (Lab Vision, Fremont, CA). Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amer-sham Biosciences), immunoblots were visualized on RX-U x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Nuclear Morphology of Embryos—After siRNA experiments, embryos were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed by three washes for 5 min each in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Blocking and permeabilization were carried out in 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:2000) for 1 min, followed by three 5-min washes in PBST. Embryos were mounted on slides after DAPI nuclear counterstaining. Transfections, Synchronization, and Multinucleated Cell Detection—RNAi oligonucleotides were synthesized by MoleculA Co. (Columbia, MD). The RNAi oligonucleotides corresponded to nucleotides 651–669 of the human L2DTL coding region (GenBank™ accession number AF195765). The negative control RNAi was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). In vitro transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. After RNAi oligonucleotide transfection, HeLa cells were synchronized at the beginning of the S phase by a double thymidine block and release. Ten hours after release (a total of 72 h after RNAi oligonucleotide transfection), the cells were stained with DAPI, and the multinucleated cells were counted under a microscope. Antibodies—Commercially obtained antibodies included anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (FL-261), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-p85 (sc-1637) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); securin antibody (DCS-280, ab3305; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, UK); and anti-rabbit and -mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Roche Applied Science). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Genomic Structure and Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of L2dtl— After the comparison of human L2DTL and the Celera mouse genome data base of strain 129/sv, 5′ and 3′ end-specific primers were designed for the putative L2dtl sequence. The 2.4-kb full-length open reading frame of L2dtl was cloned from the cDNA of murine fetal liver. The sequences of the exon and intron gaps were completed with the sequence of the L2dtl gene identified from the Celera data base. The deduced mouse gene contains 15 exons and spans 60 kb of genomic sequence on BAC A-589H1 (Fig. 1A). The cDNA contained a single open reading frame corresponding to a protein of 729 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 1B. The ATG start codon was located at position 105, the TAG codon was at position 2294, and a putative nuclear localization signal was found at amino acid positions 197–203. The sequence also included a proline-rich motif (residues 636–640) that is highly homologous to the PXXP Src homology 3-binding consensus, and a putative LXXLL motif (residues 25–29). In addition, there was a leucine zipper at 575 and five WD repeats at positions 89, 131, 207, 306, and 350. Comparisons between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens indicate that the predicted homologous functional domains are notably conserved between the two species. Importantly, the Drosophila l(2)dtl cDNA, which is 2274 bp in length and encodes 758 amino acids, also shares the five WD40 repeats and the D-box, KEN-box, nuclear localization signal, and PEST sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). L2dtl Is Expressed in Mouse Embryos and Highly Proliferative Postnatal Organs—To elucidate potential function(s) of L2dtl, we examined the expression profile of L2dtl in both embryos and postnatal mouse tissues by semiquantitative RT-PCR. During embryogenesis, L2dtl mRNA was highly expressed in the oocyte and in the E1–E12.5 embryos, but the levels were very low after E14.5 (Fig. 2A). L2dtl mRNA expression was then examined in fetal and adult mouse tissues. Among the tissues examined, including brain, cerebellum, thymus, lung, heart, liver, stomach, pancreas, spleen, kidney, ovary, and testis, L2dtl was only expressed in low levels in the lymphoid organs (i.e. thymus and spleen). The adult testis was unique in the presence of a high level of L2dtl mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). All three organs are highly proliferative in adult mice, particularly the testis. Generation and Characterization of L2dtl Knock-out Mice— Mouse ES cell lines with a truncated mutant L2dtl allele were generated by homologous recombination and used to study the in vivo function of L2dtl (Fig. 3B). The prediction was that this targeted disruption would result in the deletion of amino acids 4–17 and a frameshift, leading to early termination of L2dtl protein translation. Southern blot analysis with a probe corresponding to the upstream targeted region of L2dtl (5′ probe; Fig. 3, A and B) identified a 2.4-kb wild-type fragment and a 2.8-kb fragment for the targeted allele after PstI digestion. Another probe derived from the downstream portion of the targeted region (3′ probe; Fig. 3, A and B) yielded BstXI fragments for the wild-type (9.6-kb) and targeted (9.0-kb) alleles. Five of 282 clones were confirmed to have undergone homologous recombination (Fig. 3B). Five chimeric male mice were generated and bred with C57BL/6J mice to obtain germ line transmission of the generated L2dtl knock-out (KO) allele. Offspring hemizygous for the L2dtl-KO allele were inter-crossed, and 351 weaned pups were genotyped by PCR analysis (Table 1, Fig. 3C). No pups homozygous for the L2dtl-KO allele could be identified, indicating that pups lacking a functional L2dtl are not viable. The ratio of wild-type to hemizygous pups was about 1:2, as would be predicted from Mendelian inheritance. Hemizygous animals were grossly normal, and there was no overt phenotypic difference between hemizygotes and wild-type animals (data not shown). To determine at which stage of development the homozygous mutant embryos died, 8.5-, 10.5-, and 12.5-dpc embryos from heterozygote intercrosses were isolated and genotyped by PCR (Table 1). No homozygous mutant embryos were identified at these stages, indicating that L2dtl-KO embryos die prior to 8.5 dpc.TABLE 1Genotyping the progeny of heterozygous matingsStageTotalGenotype by PCR+/++/––/–At weaning351106245012.5-dpc embryos1138010.5-dpc embryos37112608.5-dpc embryos2711160 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Analysis of Early Embryos—The failure of L2dtl-KO embryos to develop past 8.5 dpc suggests that L2dtl is required for very early embryogenesis. To assess the role of L2dtl in early embryogenesis, 0.5-, 1.5-, 2.5-, and 3.5-dpc embryos from heterozygote intercrosses were isolated by timed pregnancies, and the collected two-cell, four-cell, 2.5-dpc, and 3.5-dpc embryos were genotyped by single-cell PCR (Fig. 4, A–C).
