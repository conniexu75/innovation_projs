https://openalex.org/W1903022559,"Chloramphenicol-resistant strains of Escherichia coli which carry the episomal resistance transfer factor R inactivate the antibiotic by enzymatic acetylation. In the presence of chloramphenicol and acetyl coenzyme A, cell extracts catalyze the formation of both a monoacetyl and a diacetyl derivative of chloramphenicol. Definitive identification of the reaction products as 3-acetoxy chloramphenicol and 1,3-diacetoxy chloramphenicol was possible with the use of thin layer chromatography and ultraviolet spectroscopy. A simple spectrophotometric assay of acetylation has been devised based on the disappearance of acetyl coenzyme A. Preliminary kinetic data for the acetylation of chloramphenicol and related compounds are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1619805557,"The acyl carrier proteins from Escherichia coli, Arthrobacter viscosus, avocado mesocarp (Persea americana), and spinach (Spinacea oleracea) have been purified to homogeneity and their chemical compositions have been examined. They are heat-stable and contain an abundance of acidic amino acids. Their total amino acid compositions are remarkably similar. The enzymic function of each acyl carrier protein was examined with fatty acid synthetase enzymes from both E. coli and spinach chloroplasts. These experiments showed that bacterial acyl carrier proteins had higher specific activities than the plant acyl carrier proteins in both synthetase systems. It was observed that the bacterial acyl carrier proteins from both E. coli and Arthrobacter were functionally indistinguishable. The spinach and avocado acyl carrier proteins were also similar to each other in their reactions with the synthetases. The fatty acids produced in cross-reactions with the use of plant acyl carrier proteins with the E. coli synthetase differ markedly from the products obtained with the bacterial acyl carrier proteins in the E. coli system. In contrast, the employment of E. coli acyl carrier protein instead of spinach acyl carrier protein in the spinach synthetase system did not alter the products of synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990030779,"Nucleotide sequences of 50 RNA codons recognized by amphibian and mammalian liver transfer RNA preparations were determined and compared with those recognized by Escherichia coli transfer RNA. Almost identical translations were obtained with transfer RNA from guinea pig liver, Xenopus laevis liver (South African clawed toad), and E. coli. However, guinea pig and Xenopus transfer RNA differ markedly from E. coli transfer RNA in relative response to certain trinucleotides. Transfer RNA from mammalian liver, amphibian liver, and amphibian muscle respond similarly to trinucleotide codons. Thus the genetic code is essentially universal, but transfer RNA from one organism may differ from that of another in relative response to some codons."
https://openalex.org/W1562138142,"Abstract Glycerol kinase of Escherichia coli has been purified and crystallized. It has a molecular weight of ∼3 x 105. The enzyme phosphorylates glycerol exclusively to l-α-glycerophosphate. It also catalyzes the phosphorylation of dihydroxyacetone and l-glyceraldehyde but with values of Km much higher than that for glycerol. d-Glyceraldehyde has a catalytic effect in promoting the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to adenosine diphosphate and Pi in the presence of the enzyme. Among the nucleoside triphosphates tested, only adenosine triphosphate was active as the phosphoryl group donor. Mn++ substitutes for Mg++, although with less activity at equal molar concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1591386696,"The tritium atom of deoxyuridylate-5-3H is obligatorily displaced in the thymidylate synthetase reaction and equilibrates with water. Accordingly, a new and simple assay for the enzyme has been devised which is based on the measurement of the tritium released. This method shows essentially the same substrate requirements and pH optimum as the spectrophotometric assay. It has the advantage of much greater sensitivity and lower blanks and is applicable to crude extracts without modification. The ratio of tritium released to dihydrofolate formed is less than 1.0 and is considered to be the result of an isotope effect."
https://openalex.org/W1492975997,"Abstract Thioredoxin reductase (3) was purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to give a preparation that appeared homogeneous by ultracentrifugal criteria, by chromatographic properties on hydroxylapatite, and by electrophoresis on agarose gel at different pH values. The molecular activity (moles of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidized per min per mole of enzyme) of the purified material at 25° and pH 7 was determined to be 1500. The purified enzyme showed no activity with glutathione and lipoate. The molecular weight of thioredoxin reductase was found to be 65,800 by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The partial specific volume was 0.724 ml per g as determined by the density gradient technique of Linderstrom-Lang. The enzyme contained 2 moles of flavin adenine dinucleotide per 65,800 g of protein. When analyzed by neutron activation analysis, no evidence was obtained for the presence of stoichiometric amounts of metals. The absorption spectrum of thioredoxin reductase in visible light was very similar to the published spectra of glutathione reductase and lipoyl dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1630766578,"Abstract Phenylalanyl ribonucleic acid synthetase has been isolated from Escherichia coli and is 93% pure as determined by analytical centrifugation and gel electrophoresis. The procedure is adaptable to large scale preparation. No other aminoacyl-RNA synthetases are present in the purified preparation. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 181,000, with an s20,w of 8.6. Optimal reaction conditions have been determined with highly purified phenylalanine transfer RNA that exhibits a Km of 2.6 x 10-7 m. The enzyme is stable when stored at 4°."
https://openalex.org/W1596033918,"Abstract When valyl ribonucleic acid synthetase of yeast was incubated with valine, adenosine triphosphate, and Mg++, an enzyme-AMP-valyl complex was formed that could transfer its amino acid residue to transfer RNA (tRNA) in a reversible reaction that did not require Mg++. The enzyme also formed a specific complex with tRNA of yeast specific for valine, but not with tRNA of Escherichia coli specific for valine. No complex formation was obtained with tRNAs specific for amino acids other than valine. Complex formation required an intact 3'-hydroxyl end group, as judged by the absence of competitive inhibition with periodate-oxidated tRNA or tRNA stripped of its terminal adenosine."
https://openalex.org/W1601605480,"Abstract Presently available evidence indicates that phosphatidic acid is an essential intermediate in the biosynthesis of glycerophosphatides in Escherichia coli. Two alternative pathways for the synthesis of phosphatidic acid in E. coli have been proposed, one involving the acylation of l-glycerol 3-phosphate, and the second the direct phosphorylation of α, β-diglyceride, catalyzed by the enzyme diglyceride kinase. If the latter pathway occurs to a significant extent in living cells of E. coli, one would expect to find a metabolically active pool of diglyceride in this organism. Pulse experiments with radioactive glycerol have failed to reveal the presence of such a pool, under conditions in which a very rapid synthesis of phosphatidic acid is taking place. Cellfree extracts of such cells, however, have been found to contain diglyceride kinase. Diglyceride kinase has been shown to be highly stereospecific, catalyzing the phosphorylation of diglycerides with the formation of derivatives of l-glycerol 3-phosphate only. Some implications of these findings for the physiological function of diglyceride kinase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2039807748,The increased sensitivity of Escherichia coli to killing by ultraviolet irradiation when frozen and the variation in this sensitivity as a function of the temperature during irradiation have been correlated with changes in the amount of DNA that was cross-linked to protein by ultraviolet light. These variations in sensitivity to killing do not correlate with the production of thymine dimers.
https://openalex.org/W1553151302,"Takadiastase adenosine deaminase, purified of phosphoesterase contaminants, is found to catalyze deamination of free adenine, adenine nucleotides and oligonucleotides, and a variety of substituted adenosine and deoxyadenosine derivatives. 3‘- and 5‘-Adenosine monophosphates are bound only as monoanions. Activity on adenylic acid oligonucleotides decreases with increasing chain length, becoming negligible in long polymers. The Km for adenosine (but notVmax) varies with pH, indicating the presence of prototropic equilibria in both free substrate and free enzyme. In the pH range from 3 to 9.5, a single enzyme ionization (apparent pKa 8.9) is indicated as important for substrate binding. The enzyme resists inactivation by many reagents for ionizable side chains of amino acids, but is uniquely sensitive to inhibition by mercuric ion and several organic mercurials. Mercurial inhibition is reversible and strictly competitive with a variety of purine substrates and analogues, and is not the result of direct interaction of inhibitor with substrate. Involvement of sulfhydryl groups in binding of mercurials is indicated by spectrophotometric detection of mercaptide formation between p-mercuribenzoate and enzyme, which indicates a binding affinity in agreement with that determined from the kinetics of inhibition. Competitive inhibition by mercurials is also observed for adenosine deaminase from calf intestinal mucosa and cytidine deaminase from Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1974187673,"Ribosomal protein from five mammalian tissues when analyzed by discontinuous electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel at pH 4.5 yielded 24 bands. Densitometric tracings indicated that the patterns of the basic ribosomal proteins from the several tissues were qualitatively similar. Protein from Escherichia coli ribosomes analyzed at pH 4.5 gave 29 bands, and the pattern was different from that of mammalian ribosomal protein. No distinct band was found when mammalian ribosomal protein was analyzed at pH 8.3 (acidic proteins). Ribosomal protein from Escherichia coli gave eight bands at pH 8.3. Thus, the structure of the genes responsible for synthesis of ribosomal protein in several mammalian tissues is the same, and different genes direct synthesis of ribosomal protein in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2068168140,"Mutants resistant to bacter iophage T5 were produced both in continuous and in stationary cultures of Escherichia coli by near-visible light, 320 to 400 millimicrons, at rates greatly exceeding spontaneous rates in the ab sence of light. Aerobic mutation rates were about twice anaerobic rates, which shows that mutations were induced in either of at least two different proces ses. Mutations induced by near-visible light involve different photochemical processes than those induced by ul traviolet light."
https://openalex.org/W2055366950,"Mixed leukocyte culture tests have been carried out on two hetero geneous but genetically defined backcross populations of rats to determine whether the reactions observed can provide the basis for histocompatibility matching. The experiments were designed so that only-one-way reactions could occur. Only when the donors of individual leukocyte mixtures differed at the important Ag-B histocompatibility locus was there any in vitro reactivity, and differences at this locus were invariably associated with the prompt rejection of skin homografts. Determination of compatibility at this locus proved to be important in that it facilitated the prolongation of survival of skin homografts by immunosuppressive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1575929058,"Abstract Synergistic control by two sequential metabolites of a biosynthetic pathway has been found to occur at an early stage of the biogenesis of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is synergistically inhibited in a manner which indicates interaction at dual sites with the same enzyme, O-succinylhomoserine synthetase. Methionine and S-adenosylmethionine exert appreciable inhibitory effects alone only at high concentrations relative to the low concentrations required for inhibition by a combination of these metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1542853570,"Abstract Dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, one of three enzymes comprising the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, dissociates into subunits in acidic solutions and in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH. Dissociation of the transacetylase in dilute acetic acid solution (0.83 m, pH 2.6) produces enzymatically inactive subunits with a weight average molecular weight of approximately 70,000. This subunit is apparently a dimer of two identical polypeptide chains. Removal of the dissociating agent by rapid dilution into phosphate or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffers (final pH, about 7) results in restoration of enzymatic activity with yields as high as 80 to 90%. The sedimentation characteristics of the reconstituted material and its appearance in the electron microscope are very similar to those of the native transacetylase. The reconstituted transacetylase combines spontaneously with pyruvate decarboxylase and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase to produce a large unit that closely resembles the native pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. A model of the transacetylase is proposed, based on biochemical and electron microscopic data, in which multichain morphological subunits are situated at the eight vertices of a cube."
https://openalex.org/W1568747667,"An enzyme, guanylate kinase, has been purified approximately 7000-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli. On the basis of its chromatographic profile, its sedimentation equilibrium pattern, its lack of tryptophan fluorescence, and its single zone in disc electrophoresis, it is a highly purified, if not homogeneous, protein species. It is specific for guanosine monophosphate or dGMP, and, in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, catalyzes the phosphorylation of these monophosphates to the corresponding diphosphates. The enzymatic activity is markedly stimulated by K+ and NH4+, but a kinetic analysis of the stimulation reveals that the two ions probably have different mechanisms of activation."
https://openalex.org/W1539500360,"Abstract The polyamine content of isolated E. coli ribosomes is dependent on the nature and concentration of the ions in the medium used for their preparation. When ribosomes are suspended in medium containing amines, the external amines are taken up by the ribosomes. When large amounts of amines are taken up by the ribosomes, part of the original ribosomal amines are displaced into the medium. Magnesium ions have similar effects on the amine content of the ribosomes. These data indicate that quantitative determinations of the polyamine content of isolated ribosomes do not necessarily reflect the amine concentration of the ribosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1537152371,"Abstract l-Ribulokinase has been purified and crystallized from induced cultures of Escherichia coli B/r mutant araA-2, a hyperproducer of this enzyme. The enzyme appears homogeneous by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography and sedimentation pattern. Recrystallization does not increase its specific activity. Acrylamide gel disc electrophoresis at pH 8.3 shows a trace of a slower component, not exceeding 5% of the total material. The molecular weight of l-ribulokinase as determined by osmotic pressure, sedimentation equilibrium, and sedimentation and diffusion is 9.8 ± 0.2 x 104. The enzyme is unstable at acid pH values, but is stable when stored at pH 7.6 or above. It resists inactivation by heating at 60.50 for 30 min at this pH. It phosphorylates both l- and d-ribulose, the Km for d-ribulose being about twice that for l-ribulose. The molecular activity for purified enzyme is about 1700 moles of product formed per min per mole of enzyme for l-ribulose. Amino acid analysis shows the absence of valine and methionine. The enzyme is estimated to occupy about 3 to 4% of the total protein in the crude extract of the fully induced araA-2 cell."
https://openalex.org/W1993350534,"Quantitative in vitro tests showed that purified preparations of L-asparaginase from Escherichia coli were more toxic to blood lymphocytes from 12 of 15 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than to lymphocytes from 25 persons with normal hemograms. Incubation for 7 days with 10 units per milliliter killed, on the average, 77 percent of leukemic and 34 percent of normal lymphocytes. The reagent produced appreciable toxicity to leukemic lymphocytes after 2 days of incubation."
https://openalex.org/W1531856189,"Abstract Growing cells incubated in a medium lacking glucose undergo a rapid breakdown of polyribosomes to single 70 S ribosomes. This conversion is accompanied by a loss of protein-synthetic capacity in vivo and is inhibited by chloramphenicol, but not by puromycin. The conversion of polysomes to 70 S ribosomes, with a half-life of 1½ to 2½ min at 37°, appears to reflect a breakdown of messenger ribonucleic acid. The polysomes remaining during starvation remain the most active sites of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1518324415,"Abstract In the absence of any added template and after a variable lag period, ribonucleic acid polymerase catalyzes the polymerization of adenosine triphosphate and uridine triphosphate to polyadenylate and polyuridylate. The length of the lag period varies inversely with amount of enzyme and substrate present in the incubation mixture. The reaction requires Mn++; it does not occur if Mg++ is the only metal ion present. Unprimed synthesis of polyadenylate and polyuridylate is inhibited in the presence of polynucleotides, spermidine, guanosine triphosphate, and cytidine triphosphate. The product was characterized by nearest neighbor analysis, ultracentrifugal analysis, and thermal denaturation studies."
https://openalex.org/W1560567501,"Abstract Acyl derivatives of acyl carrier protein (ACP), chemically prepared from fatty acids of intermediate chain length and Escherichia coli ACP, are elongated by the fatty acid synthetase system of E. coli, by extracts of photoauxotrophic Euglena gracilis, and by spinach chloroplasts. These conversions require the presence of malonyl coenzyme A and of a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-generating system. The E. coli system elongates octanoyl-ACP both to saturated and to unsaturated acids, but converts decanoyl-ACP and lauryl-ACP to saturated acids only. Extracts of Euglena convert the acyl-ACP derivatives of C8, C10, C12, and C16 fatty acids to stearate, oleate, and arachidate. The formation of oleic acid from these precursors requires aerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1531549616,"Abstract When dihydrolipoyl transacetylase is treated with iodoacetate in the presence of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, a product is obtained which dissociates at pH 12 to yield material with an average molecular weight of approximately 36,000 as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Amino acid analysis, end group analysis, and peptide mapping after digestion with trypsin indicate that the enzyme consists of identical polypeptide chains. Each chain contains 1 molecule of covalently bound lipoic acid. The average molecular weight of the native transacetylase is approximately 1 million as determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. It appears that the transacetylase consists of 24 identical polypeptide chains and that these chains are linked by noncovalent bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1484117797,"Abstract Apocytochrome b562 reacts with hemin to form holocytochrome b562. The kinetics of holocytochrome formation show that three separate first order reactions can be recognized in the over-all reconstitution reaction. On this basis, it is postulated that the formation of holocytochrome involves a minimum of four reaction steps which can be formulated as follows: [see PDF for equation] The initial reaction represents the formation of the apocytochrome-hemin complex (X1). This initial reaction, which would be second order, is apparently too rapid to be observed in the stop-flow apparatus (l5 msec) and may be diffusion-controlled. The subsequent first order reactions give rise to intermediate complexes (X2 and X3) and finally to holocytochrome b562. The first order rate constants, k1, k2, and k3 for these reactions at pH 7, are 20.9, 2.64, and 0.098 sec-1, respectively. The rate constant (k3) for the rate-limiting step increases at alkaline pH values and decreases under acidic conditions. The rate constants k1 and k2 show opposite behavior. Both k1 and k2 increase under acidic conditions and decrease at alkaline pH values. The energy of activation of the over-all reconstitution reaction is 18.1 kcal per mole. Diazotization and acetylation of apocytochrome b562 produces in each case a modified apoprotein which retains the ability to combine with hemin. The spectrum of the diazotized cytochrome b562-hemin complex, in the oxidized state, is quite different from that of the native holocytochrome; however, the spectra of the two forms in the reduced state are quite similar. Acetylated apocytochrome b562 and hemin form a complex which exhibits two broad absorption bands centering at 390 and 345 mµ. Reduction of the acetylated apocytochrome-hemin complex yields a complex which has an absorption spectrum identical with that of the reduced form of the native cytochrome. Treatment of apocytochrome b562 with monoiodoacetic acid prior to complex formation with hemin has no effect on the reconstitution reaction. Treatment of apocytochrome b562 with iodine prevents the reconstitution reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1516807707,"Abstract Analysis by the Sanger procedure of cyanogen bromide (BrCN)-treated β-galactosidase and reduced carboxymethylated β-galactosidase indicated the presence of 23 peptides with 11 different NH2-terminal amino acids. Of two peptides containing NH2-terminal threonine, one obtained after gel filtration was found to be threonylhomoserine. Threonylmethionine was shown to be the NH2-terminal sequence of β-galactosidase by BrCN treatment of the dinitrophenylated protein and isolation of dinitrophenyl-threonylhomoserine. Because the dinitrophenyl dipeptide was ether-soluble and could be separated readily, the isolation procedure was applied to crude extracts of Escherichia coli grown in the presence of 14C-methionine or 14C-threonine. Higher levels of radioactivity were found in the dipeptide obtained from a wild type strain induced for β-galactosidase compared to a noninduced control. Nonsense mutants in which the β-galactosidase chain is expected to be prematurely terminated were tested by the same procedure to obtain evidence for the formation of such chains. For two of these mutants, one which maps close to the operator site and the second which maps near the center of the gene, the same amount of radioactivity was found in the dipeptide from the induced cultures compared to the noninduced. However, for a third mutant, which maps close to the permease gene, clear evidence for higher levels of radioactivity from the induced compared to the noninduced cultures was obtained when growth was carried out at 30° rather than 37°. These results suggest that β-galactosidase is oriented to its gene in such a manner that the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus of the protein correspond to the operator and permease ends of the gene, respectively."

The stimulatory action of galactose results from the induction of a separate galactoside permease, probably identical with that induced by galactinol. Lactose, d-fucose, thiomethylgalactoside, and isopropylthiogalactoside do not act as inducers.

We have supposed that these lymphoid cells transformed from bone marrow stem cells are immuno-logically competent cells which are able to induce the ‘graft-versus-host’ reaction.

It was of interest to determine the effect of S-adenosyl-L-ethionine on this reaction since this compound can substitute for adenosylmethionine in certain enzyme-catalysed reactions such as the formation of the ethyl derivatives of phospholipid choline, creatine, histidine and carnosine3,4. Adenosylethionine bromide was isolated from rat liver after ethionine feeding5. It behaved as a single spot on a paper chromatogram with 1-butanol–acetic acid–water (60:15:25, v/v/v) as the solvent. After boiling in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide for 1 h a chromatogram of the digest yielded spots for ethionine, homo-serine and adenine5. Adenosylmethionine iodide was purchased from Calbiochem, Los Angeles, Calif. It was found (Table 1) that adenosylethionine could not replace adenosylmethionine in the reaction under investigation. When added simultaneously at equal concentration little or no effect was observed. Significant inhibition was observed when adenosylethionine was pre-incubated with the enzyme or when higher concentrations of adenosylethionine were employed."
