https://openalex.org/W2563098883,"By investigating ring currents, a six-porphyrin nanoring molecule is shown to be antiaromatic in its 4+ oxidation state and aromatic in its 6+ oxidation state. The concept of aromaticity (and its counterpart antiaromaticity) is central to understanding molecules with delocalized electronic structures. One of the key features of (anti)aromatic molecules is the establishment of ring currents when placed in magnetic fields. It has not been clear whether such ring currents can still be established in large molecules and supramolecular constructs, and therefore whether this is analogous to persistent currents observed in much larger metal and semiconductor rings. Now, Harry Anderson and colleagues show that a large porphyrin-based nanoring exhibits a ring current when placed in a magnetic field, showing that the electron wavefunction preserves coherence around a 7.5-nanometre perimeter and that (anti)aromaticity is preserved in a large molecule. The direction of the ring current can be changed by altering the oxidation state of the molecule, so while the neutral molecule is non-aromatic, the 4+ oxidation state is antiaromatic and the 6+ is aromatic. Aromatic and antiaromatic molecules—which have delocalized circuits of [4n + 2] or [4n] electrons, respectively—exhibit ring currents around their perimeters1,2,3,4. The direction of the ring current in an aromatic molecule is such as to generate a magnetic field that opposes the external field inside the ring (a ‘diatropic’ current), while the ring current in an antiaromatic molecule flows in the reverse direction (‘paratropic’)5. Similar persistent currents occur in metal or semiconductor rings, when the phase coherence of the electronic wavefunction is preserved around the ring6,7. Persistent currents in non-molecular rings switch direction as a function of the magnetic flux passing through the ring, so that they can be changed from diatropic (‘aromatic’) to paratropic (‘antiaromatic’) simply by changing the external magnetic field. As in molecular systems, the direction of the persistent current also depends on the number of electrons8. The relationship between ring currents in molecular and non-molecular rings is poorly understood, partly because they are studied in different size regimes: the largest aromatic molecules have diameters of about one nanometre, whereas persistent currents are observed in microfabricated rings with diameters of 20–1,000 nanometres. Understanding the connection between aromaticity and quantum-coherence effects in mesoscopic rings provides a motivation for investigating ring currents in molecules of an intermediate size9. Here we show, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory, that a six-porphyrin nanoring template complex, with a diameter of 2.4 nanometres, is antiaromatic in its 4+ oxidation state (80 π electrons) and aromatic in its 6+ oxidation state (78 π electrons). The antiaromatic state has a huge paramagnetic susceptibility, despite having no unpaired electrons. This work demonstrates that a global ring current can be promoted in a macrocycle by adjusting its oxidation state to suppress the local ring currents of its components.The discovery of ring currents around a molecule with a circumference of 7.5 nanometres, at room temperature, shows that quantum coherence can persist in surprisingly large molecular frameworks."
https://openalex.org/W2563236905,"Packaging of the genome into a protein capsid and its subsequent delivery into a host cell are two fundamental processes in the life cycle of a virus. Unlike double-stranded DNA viruses, which pump their genome into a preformed capsid, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as bacteriophage MS2, co-assemble their capsid with the genome; however, the structural basis of this co-assembly is poorly understood. MS2 infects Escherichia coli via the host 'sex pilus' (F-pilus); it was the first fully sequenced organism and is a model system for studies of translational gene regulation, RNA-protein interactions, and RNA virus assembly. Its positive-sense ssRNA genome of 3,569 bases is enclosed in a capsid with one maturation protein monomer and 89 coat protein dimers arranged in a T = 3 icosahedral lattice. The maturation protein is responsible for attaching the virus to an F-pilus and delivering the viral genome into the host during infection, but how the genome is organized and delivered is not known. Here we describe the MS2 structure at 3.6 Å resolution, determined by electron-counting cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and asymmetric reconstruction. We traced approximately 80% of the backbone of the viral genome, built atomic models for 16 RNA stem-loops, and identified three conserved motifs of RNA-coat protein interactions among 15 of these stem-loops with diverse sequences. The stem-loop at the 3' end of the genome interacts extensively with the maturation protein, which, with just a six-helix bundle and a six-stranded β-sheet, forms a genome-delivery apparatus and joins 89 coat protein dimers to form a capsid. This atomic description of genome-capsid interactions in a spherical ssRNA virus provides insight into genome delivery via the host sex pilus and mechanisms underlying ssRNA-capsid co-assembly, and inspires speculation about the links between nucleoprotein complexes and the origins of viruses."

Here, we develop 'depalmitoylation probes' (DPPs), small-molecule fluorophores, to monitor the endogenous activity levels of 'erasers' of S-palmitoylation, acylprotein thioesterases (APTs). Live-cell analysis with DPPs reveals rapid growth-factor-mediated inhibition of the depalmitoylation activity of APTs, exposing a novel regulatory mechanism of dynamic lipid signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2561662001,"A total of 787 non-waxy rice lines– 116 hybrids and 671 inbreds–were used to study the apparent amylose content (AAC), gelatinization temperature (GT), and rapid visco analyzer (RVA) pasting viscosity properties of rice starch to understand their importance in breeding better rice varieties. The investigated traits showed a wide range of diversity for both hybrid (HG) and inbred (IG) groups. The combinations of the different categories of AAC and GT were random in HG but were non-random in IG. For inbred lines, the high level of AAC tended to combine with the low level of GT, the intermediate level of AAC tended to have high or intermediate GT, and the low level of AAC tended to have high or low GT. Some stable correlations of the AAC, GT, and RVA properties may be the results derived from the physicochemical relationships among these traits, which rice breeders could utilize for selection in advanced breeding generations. Through cluster analysis, IG and HG were divided into 52 and 31 sub-clusters, respectively. Identifying the cultivars having AAC, GT, and RVA properties similar to that of popular high-quality rice varieties seems to be an interesting strategy and could be directly used for adaptation trials to breed high-quality rice varieties in targeted areas in a more customized manner."
https://openalex.org/W2567146478,"Accumulation of damaged DNA in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, genomic instability, and HSC aging and might promote hematological malignancies with age. Despite this, the regulatory pathways implicated in the HSC DNA damage response have not been fully elucidated. One of the sources of DNA damage is reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by both exogenous and endogenous insults. Balancing ROS levels in HSC requires FOXO3, which is an essential transcription factor for HSC maintenance implicated in HSC aging. Elevated ROS levels result in defective Foxo3-/- HSC cycling, among many other deficiencies. Here, we show that loss of FOXO3 leads to the accumulation of DNA damage in primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), associated specifically with reduced expression of genes implicated in the repair of oxidative DNA damage. We provide further evidence that Foxo3-/- HSPC are defective in DNA damage repair. Specifically, we show that the base excision repair pathway, the main pathway utilized for the repair of oxidative DNA damage, is compromised in Foxo3-/- primitive hematopoietic cells. Treating mice in vivo with N-acetylcysteine reduces ROS levels, rescues HSC cycling defects, and partially mitigates HSPC DNA damage. These results indicate that DNA damage accrued as a result of elevated ROS in Foxo3-/- mutant HSPC is at least partially reversible. Collectively, our findings suggest that FOXO3 serves as a protector of HSC genomic stability and health."
https://openalex.org/W2564528384,"Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectroscopy (CXMS) provides proximity information for the cross-linked residues and is used increasingly for modeling protein structures. However, experimentally identified cross-links are sometimes incompatible with the known structure of a protein, as the distance calculated between the cross-linked residues far exceeds the maximum length of the cross-linker. The discrepancies may persist even after eliminating potentially false cross-links and excluding intermolecular ones. Thus the “over-length” cross-links may arise from alternative excited-state conformation of the protein. Here we present a method and associated software DynaXL for visualizing the ensemble structures of multidomain proteins based on intramolecular cross-links identified by mass spectrometry with high confidence. Representing the cross-linkers and cross-linking reactions explicitly, we show that the protein excited-state structure can be modeled with as few as two over-length cross-links. We demonstrate the generality of our method with three systems: calmodulin, enzyme I, and glutamine-binding protein, and we show that these proteins alternate between different conformations for interacting with other proteins and ligands. Taken together, the over-length chemical cross-links contain valuable information about protein dynamics, and our findings here illustrate the relationship between dynamic domain movement and protein function.

Taken together, the over-length chemical cross-links contain valuable information about protein dynamics, and our findings here illustrate the relationship between dynamic domain movement and protein function. Present-day structural biology largely focuses on the predominant ground-state structures of proteins, which are most populated and readily detectable. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear that a protein can transiently adopt alternative, often lowly populated excited-state conformations. Dynamic inter-conversion between protein ground and excited states, together constituting the ensemble structures of a protein, enables the protein to perform its function (1Henzler-Wildman K.

For a multidomain protein, the dynamics usually involve the rearrangement between the domains, which can be essential for ligand recognition, catalytic activity, and allosteric modulation of the protein (3Tang C.

Among the existing techniques, NMR spectroscopy is known for identifying the excited states and for elucidating protein dynamics (6Sekhar A. Kay L.E.

The cross-linked residues that are identified by high resolution mass spectroscopy should be close to each other, within the reach of the cross-linker used. However, it has been shown that the straight-line distance between the Cα atoms of cross-linked residues calculated from the known structure sometimes exceed the maximum length of the cross-linker (10Merkley E.D.

The discrepancy between experimental cross-links and protein structures may be due to false identifications of the cross-links.

Recently it has been shown that for protein-protein complexes, intermolecular cross-links incompatible with a unique complex structure may arise from some alternative arrangement(s) of the complex (11Ferber M. Kosinski J. Ori A. Rashid U.J. Moreno-Morcillo M. Simon B. Bouvier G. Batista P.R. Müller C.W. Beck M. Nilges M.

Rep. 2015; 1: 127-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus reason that over-length intramolecular cross-links can be explained by the dynamic movement between different parts of the protein. Simple straight-line distance restraints derived from experimental cross-links has been used for modeling protein structures. However, as the cross-linker cannot go through the protein and can only go around the protein, intramolecular cross-links are better assessed with solvent-accessible surface (SAS) distances (21Kahraman A. Malmström L. Aebersold R. Xwalk: computing and visualizing distances in cross-linking experiments.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 2163-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The SAS distance for an intramolecular cross-link is usually longer than the straight-line Euclidean Cα-Cα distance for the two cross-linked residues, and therefore, the discrepancy between the calculated distance and maximum length of the cross-linker is even larger. To account for all intramolecular cross-links identified with high confidence, here we present a method for assessing the conformational fluctuations of multidomain proteins (the associated software DynaXL is freely available from the author upon request). In this method we represent the cross-linkers with atomic details, and we model the protein alternative conformations with conjoined rigid body/torsion angle simulated annealing. We illustrate our method by characterizing the dynamics of three multidomain proteins, and we show how the domain arrangements of these proteins can enable their specific functions. A multidomain protein may dynamically interconvert between the ground state and the excited state, in which the domains have different arrangements. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the open conformation corresponds to the ground state, whereas the closed conformation corresponds to the excited state. For a protein existing only in an open conformation, the residues located in the opposite domains are too far away to be cross-linked despite that a mono-linked product can be readily formed. On the other hand, if the protein can transiently switch from the open conformation to the closed conformation, even for a short period of the time, the alternative conformation may permit the cross-linking reaction to complete. The residues that can react with the cross-linking reagent have to be appropriately located in the opposite domains. Thus the alternative conformation may not be efficiently captured. Conversely, if one or more over-length interdomain cross-links were identified by mass spectrometry with high confidence, it is likely that the predominant open state transiently fluctuates to some alternative conformation, as discussed below. We implemented this concept into our modeling approach. The workflow for the associated software DynaXL is illustrated in Fig. 2 and explained in detail with the analysis of calmodulin followed by two other examples (a snapshot of the software interface is shown in supplemental Fig. S1). DynaXL takes as input the known PDB structure of a protein and a list of high confidence intramolecular cross-links obtained from CXMS analysis on a 1:1 mixture of the 14N- and 15N-labeled proteins. Collecting CXMS data on this mixed sample, we were able to differentiate intramolecular versus intermolecular cross-links and also to eliminate false positives (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Domain boundaries in multidomain proteins are delineated by multithreading alignment (22Xue Z. Xu D. Wang Y. Zhang Y. ThreaDom: extracting protein domain boundary information from multiple threading alignments.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29: i247-i256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Belsom A. Schneider M.

Proteomics. 2016; 15: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and validated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which allows the definition of rigid bodies and the classification of intra- versus interdomain cross-link. The intradomain cross-links are examined against the known protein structures for compatibility, thus to confirm the rigidity of each domain. All interdomain cross-links involving rigid residues are used for characterizing protein ensemble structure that comprises the ground-state conformation and any additional excited-state conformation. If a two-conformer ensemble structure cannot account for all interdomain cross-links, DynaXL attempts a three-conformer ensemble structure and so on until all cross-links are satisfied. To account for intramolecular cross-links, it is better to use SAS distances (21Kahraman A. Malmström L. Aebersold R. Xwalk: computing and visualizing distances in cross-linking experiments.Bioinformatics. 2011; 27: 2163-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To this end, DynaXL treats the geometry of the cross-linker and the proximity between the reactive side chains with atomic details. With explicit modeling, the cross-linkers can only be located at protein surface. Due to the curvature of a protein, SAS distance restraints imposes a more stringent restraint than does a straight-line Cα-Cα distance restraint. To our knowledge, all previous modeling of protein structures from CXMS data used only straight-line Euclidean distance restraints applied to the Cα atoms (or Cβ atoms) of cross-linked residues (11Ferber M.

CaM comprises an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. In the absence of a ligand, Ca2+-CaM was found to exist in an open, extended conformation in crystal (26Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Calmodulin structure refined at 1.7 Å resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), with the two domains well separated (Fig. 3A). We performed CXMS experiments on an equimolar mixture of 14N-labeled (natural isotope abundance) and 15N-labeled Ca2+-CaM to exclude cross-links that may arise from protein homo-oligomers (20Gong Z. Ding Y.-H. Dong X. Liu N. Zhang E.E. Dong M.-Q. Tang C. Visualizing the ensemble structures of protein complexes using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry.Biophys.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46487-46492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2, an intramolecular cross-link should yield just two cross-link isoforms of equal abundance, one between two 14N-labeled light peptides (L1-L2) and one between two 15N-labeled heavy peptides (H1-H2). An intermolecular cross-link yields two additional isoforms each consisting of a 14N-labeled peptide and a 15N-labeled peptide (L1-H2 and H1-L2). Thus cross-links with a significant intermolecular component were eliminated, leaving only the intramolecular cross-links. We performed CXMS experiments using amine-specific bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate (BS3) and a shorter cross-linking reagent bis-sulfosuccinimidyl glutarate (BS2G, supplemental Fig. S3) on different Ca2+-CaM protein samples. Filtering the data with stringent criteria to eliminate potentially false identifications (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), we identified eight intramolecular cross-links for ligand-free Ca2+-CaM with high confidence (supplemental Fig. S4 and Table S1). Some of the cross-links were only observed with BS3, indicating that the protein amine groups are likely too far away to react with the shorter BS2G (supplemental Table S1). The four intradomain cross-links agree with the respective domain structure (supplemental Fig. S5 and Table S1), confirming that the dynamics within each domain are small if present. The rigidity within each domain was further confirmed with MD simulations; except for N- and C-terminal residues and linker residues, most residues display backbone root mean square fluctuations of <2 Å (supplemental Fig. S6). In contrast, none of the four interdomain cross-links agree with the open structure of Ca2+-CaM, even with the flexibility of the explicitly modeled lysine side chains and attached cross-linker considered (Fig. 3A). To account for the over-length interdomain cross-links, we introduced a second conformer of Ca2+-CaM and refined the ensemble structure based on the three interdomain cross-links involving rigid lysine residues. The interdomain cross-link Ala1-Lys94 was not used in the modeling due to the flexibility of the N terminus. We grouped the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 4–77) and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 82–147) as rigid bodies connected by a polypeptide linker (residues 78–81). The arrangement between NTD and CTD was optimized using the DynaXL approach, thus allowing the interdomain cross-linking reactions to take place. Based on the cross-links identified with high confidence, we obtained the alternative closed conformation of ligand-free Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 3B and supplemental Table S2). The closed-state structures are highly converged, with an overall r.m.s. deviation of 1.08 ± 0.35 Å for backbone heavy atoms (supplemental Fig. S7). The closed-state structures obtained can also be assessed with spherical coordinates. With respect to the open structure, the vector from the center of mass of the NTD to the center of mass of the CTD rotates by 58.5 ± 5.1° and shortens from 37.5 Å to 23.8 ± 0.7 Å (supplemental Fig. S8, A and C). To ensure complete sampling of the conformational space, we also started the refinement with the domains in random relative positions. The resulting structures for the closed state are almost identical to those calculated from the open-state structure of Ca2+-CaM (supplemental Fig. S8, B and D), consistent with the expectation that the correct structure should converge irrespective of the starting conformation. For the cross-linking reaction, a cross-linker can be first attached to either domain to form a mono-linked intermediate before being cross-linked to another domain. Accordingly, we modeled the cross-linkers to either the NTD or CTD, which yielded almost identical structures (supplemental Fig. S9). Because a two-conformer ensemble already satisfied all cross-links, introducing an additional conformer brought no improvement. To illustrate how DynaXL can be used to model larger ensembles, we added two artificial cross-links. The new restraint list can no longer be satisfied with a two-conformer ensemble but can be accounted for with a three-conformer ensemble in which the two conformers adopt closed states with distinct domain arrangements (supplemental Fig. S10). As such, we have shown that the DynaXL approach allows the modeling of the alternative closed state of ligand-free Ca2+-CaM. The structural convergence is due to the explicit modeling of the cross-linker, to the conjoined rigid-body/torsion angle refinement approach, and to the self-consistency of CXMS restraints. Indeed, refining against any one of the interdomain CXMS restraints can already lead to a closed-state structure for the ligand-free Ca2+-CaM. Although dispersed, the centers of mass of the resulting structures are similar to each other and to those refined with all three interdomain cross-links (supplemental Fig. S11, A–C). The structures become more converged when refining with two interdomain cross-links (supplemental Fig. S11, D–F) because the alternative structure has to satisfy both restraints at the same time. Importantly, the CXMS restraints can be cross-validated (the free reactive end of the mono-linked intermediate is found in close proximity to the target lysine side chain in the opposite domain provided that the other two cross-links have been formed (supplemental Table S2). Moreover, the ensemble structure can also account for the Ala1-Lys94 cross-link, which was not used in the refinement (supplemental Fig. S12). Taken together, the DynaXL approach reveals that the ligand-free Ca2+-CaM transiently adopts a closed state, and the cross-linking captures and stabilizes this preexisting excited-state conformation. The ensemble structure of Ca2+-CaM can also be validated with other techniques. Previous NMR studies have shown that ligand-free Ca2+-CaM transiently adopts a closed conformation, and the excited state is present for only ∼5% of the time (28Bertini I. Del Bianco C. Gelis I.

The PRE and CXMS structures are similar to each other (supplemental Fig. S13B), and the backbone r.m.s. difference was as small as 1.66 Å (Fig. 4A). The structural similarity further attests that CXMS can detect and visualize the lowly populated excited states of proteins, a task that has been mostly reserved for NMR (6Sekhar A. Kay L.E.

There are a number of structures determined for ligand-bound Ca-CaM2+, and the exact domain arrangement varies depending on the bound ligand (supplemental Fig. S14A). The closed-state structures calculated for ligand-free Ca2+-CaM based on the CXMS data and the closed-state structures for ligand-bound Ca2+-CaM are similar (supplemental Fig. S14A), and the smallest r.m.s. difference is 1.93 Å as referenced to the complex structure bound to an IQ-domain from voltage-gated calcium channel (Fig. 4B) (16Shi Y.

Yet, most evidence on human trafficking has focused on women and girls trafficked for sex work, with scant research on trafficked men and boys. Methods We analyse survey data from the largest systematic consecutive sample of trafficked people collected to date to describe the prevalence of violence, occupational health risks and injuries and associated factors. Participants were labour-trafficked men and boys using post-trafficking support services in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Findings Data are presented on 446 males aged 10–58. Men and boys were mainly trafficked for fishing (61.7%), manufacturing (19.1%) and begging (5.2%). Fishermen worked extensive hours (mean 18.8 hours/day, SD 5.9) and factory workers worked on average 11.9 hours/day (SD 2.9). 35.5% of male survivors had been injured while trafficked; 29.4% received no personal protective equipment (e.g. gloves). The most commonly reported injuries among all males were deep cuts (61.8%) and skin injuries (36.7%), injuries for which fewer than one-quarter reported receiving medical care. Six fishermen lost body parts, none of whom received medical care. Most males (80.5%) had no or very few rest breaks. One-third (37.8%) experienced severe violence. Work-related injuries were associated with severe violence (AOR 3.44, CI:1.63–7.26), being in the fishing sector, (AOR 4.12, CI:2.39–7.09) and threats (AOR 2.77, CI:1.62–4.75). Experiencing any violence was associated with threats (AOR 26.86, CI:14.0–51.23), being in the fishing sector (AOR 18.53, CI:8.74–39.28) and fluency in language of destination country (AOR 0.39, CI:0.20–0.75). Conclusion This study highlights the abuse and extreme occupational hazards suffered by trafficked men and boys. Occupational health and safety interventions are urgently needed to protect male migrant labourers working in high-risk sectors, particularly fishing."
https://openalex.org/W2564640374,"Pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is an essential regulator of fertility in females and of quantitatively normal spermatogenesis in males. Pituitary-derived activins are thought to act as major stimulators of FSH synthesis by gonadotrope cells. In vitro, activins signal via SMAD3, SMAD4, and forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) to regulate transcription of the FSHβ subunit gene (Fshb). Consistent with this model, gonadotrope-specific Smad4 or Foxl2 knock-out mice have greatly reduced FSH and are subfertile. The role of SMAD3 in vivo is unresolved; however, residual FSH production in Smad4 conditional knock-out mice may derive from partial compensation by SMAD3 and its ability to bind DNA in the absence of SMAD4. To test this hypothesis and determine the role of SMAD3 in FSH biosynthesis, we generated mice lacking both the SMAD3 DNA binding domain and SMAD4 specifically in gonadotropes. Conditional knock-out females were hypogonadal, acyclic, and sterile and had thread-like uteri; their ovaries lacked antral follicles and corpora lutea. Knock-out males were fertile but had reduced testis weights and epididymal sperm counts. These phenotypes were consistent with those of Fshb knock-out mice. Indeed, pituitary Fshb mRNA levels were nearly undetectable in both male and female knock-outs. In contrast, gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor mRNA levels were significantly elevated in knock-outs in both sexes. Interestingly, luteinizing hormone production was altered in a sex-specific fashion. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that SMAD3 is required for FSH synthesis in vivo.

Podocytes accumulate globotriaosylceramide inclusions more than other kidney cell types in Fabry patients. Podocyte injury occurs early in age, and is progressive. Since injured podocytes detach into the urine (podocyturia), we hypothesized that podocyturia would increase in Fabry patients and correlate with clinical severity of Fabry nephropathy. Urine specimens from 39 Fabry patients and 24 healthy subjects were evaluated for podocyturia. Most of the Fabry patients and many healthy subjects had podocyturia. The number of podocytes per gram of urine creatinine (UPodo/g Cr) was 3.6 fold greater in Fabry patients (3,741 ± 2796; p = 0.001) than healthy subjects (1,040 ± 972). Fabry patients with normoalbuminuria and normoproteinuria had over 2-fold greater UPodo/g Cr than healthy subjects (p = 0.048). UPodo/gCr was inversely related to eGFR in male patients (r = -0.69, p = 0.003). UPodo/gCr was directly related to urine protein creatinine ratio (r = 0.33; p = 0.04) in all Fabry patients. These studies confirm increased podocyturia in Fabry disease, even when proteinuria and albuminuria are absent. Podocyturia correlates with clinical severity of Fabry nephropathy, and potentially may be of prognostic value."

https://openalex.org/W2561882527,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular degradation/recycling system that is essential for cellular homeostasis but is dysregulated in a number of diseases, including myocardial hypertrophy. Although it is clear that limiting or accelerating autophagic flux can result in pathological cardiac remodeling, the physiological signaling pathways that fine-tune cardiac autophagy are poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrated that stimulation of cardiomyocytes with phenylephrine (PE), a well known hypertrophic agonist, suppresses autophagy and that activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is necessary for PE-stimulated autophagy suppression and subsequent initiation of hypertrophic growth. Mechanistically, we showed that FAK phosphorylates Beclin1, a core autophagy protein, on Tyr-233 and that this post-translational modification limits Beclin1 association with Atg14L and reduces Beclin1-dependent autophagosome formation. Remarkably, although ectopic expression of wild-type Beclin1 promoted cardiomyocyte atrophy, expression of a Y233E phosphomimetic variant of Beclin1 failed to affect cardiomyocyte size. Moreover, genetic depletion of Beclin1 attenuated PE-mediated/FAK-dependent initiation of myocyte hypertrophy in vivo Collectively, these findings identify FAK as a novel negative regulator of Beclin1-mediated autophagy and indicate that this pathway can facilitate the promotion of compensatory hypertrophic growth. This novel mechanism to limit Beclin1 activity has important implications for treating a variety of pathologies associated with altered autophagic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2562235211,"The high susceptibility of newborn infants to sepsis is as cribed to animmaturity of the neonatal immune system, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Newborn monocytes massively release the alarmins S100A8/S100A9. In adults, these are major regulators of immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We investigated whether S100A8/S100A9 cause an expansion of monocytic MDSCs (Mo-MDSCs) in neonates, thereby contributing to an immunocompromised state. Mo-MDSCs have been assigned to CD14+/human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR−/low/CD33+ monocytes in humans and to CD11b+/Gr-1int/Ly6G−/Ly6Chi cells in mice. We found monocytes with these phenotypes significantly expanded in their respective newborns. Functionally, however, they did not prove immunosuppressive but rather responded inflammatorily to microbial stimulation. Their expansion did not correlate with high S100A8/S100A9 levels in cord blood. Murine studies revealed an excessive expansion of CD11b+/Gr-1int/Ly6G−/Ly6Chi monocytes in S100A9−/− neonates compared to wild-type neonates. This strong baseline expansion was associated with hyperinflammatory responses during endotoxemia and fatal septic courses. Treating S100A9−/− neonates directly after birth with S100A8/S100A9 alarmins prevented excessive expansion of this inflammatory monocyte population and death from septic shock.

This increase was associated with a corresponding increase in pentose phosphate pathway flux, assessed using 13C-labeled glucose, and an increase in glutaredoxin activity, which catalyzes the glutathione-dependent reduction of DHA. These results show that the rate of DHA reduction depends not only on the level of reduced glutathione, but also on the rate of NADPH production, contradicting the conclusions of some previous studies.

Although public transport networks such as airline and railway networks have been extensively studied, the status of bus networks still remains in obscurity. In developing countries like India, where bus networks play an important role in day-to-day commutation, it is of significant interest to analyze its topological structure and answer some of the basic questions on its evolution, growth, robustness and resiliency. In this paper, we model the bus networks of major Indian cities as graphs in \textit{L}-space, and evaluate their various statistical properties using concepts from network science. Our analysis reveals a wide spectrum of network topology with the common underlying feature of small-world property. We observe that the networks although, robust and resilient to random attacks are particularly degree-sensitive. Unlike real-world networks, like Internet, WWW and airline, which are virtual, bus networks are physically constrained. The presence of various geographical and economic constraints allow these networks to evolve over time. Our findings therefore, throw light on the evolution of such geographically and socio-economically constrained networks which will help us in designing more efficient networks in the future."

However, separating the combined effects of oil pollution, environmental variables and methodological aspects of beach monitoring on seabird stranding patterns is a challenging task. The effects of a comprehensive set of oceanographic and climatic variables and oil pollution on seabird strandings in a tropical area of Brazil were investigated herein, using two robust and innovative methods: Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Structural Equation Modeling. We assessed strandings of four resident seabird species along 480 km of beaches divided into 11 sampling areas, between November 2010 and September 2013. We found that increasing the distance from the nearest breeding island reduce the seabird stranding events. Storm activity and biological productivity were the most important factors affecting the stranding events of brown boobies Sula leucogaster, Cabot’s terns Thalasseus acuflavidus and kelp gulls Larus dominicanus. These species are also indirectly affected by warm tropical waters, which reduce chlorophyll-a concentrations. Beach surveys are, thus, useful to investigate the mortality rates of resident species near breeding sites, where individuals are more abundant and exposed to local factors associated with at-sea mortality. In contrast, conservation actions and monitoring programs for far-ranging seabird species are needed in more distant foraging areas. Furthermore, beach monitoring programs investigating the impact of oil pollution on seabirds need to account for the effects of environmental factors on stranding patterns.

To examine whether PLN inhibition can improve survival rate as well as cardiac function in heart failure, we performed PLN ablation in calsequestrin overexpressing (CSQ-Tg) mice, a severe heart failure model, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system. According this method, generation rate of PLN wild type mice (PLN copy >0.95) and PLN homozygous knockout (KO) mice (PLN copy <0.05) were 39.1% and 10.5%, respectively. While CSQ overexpression causes severe heart failure symptoms and premature death, a significant ameliorating effect on survival rate was observed in PLN homozygous KO/CSQ-Tg mice compared to PLN wild type/CSQ-Tg mice (median survival days are 55 and 50 days, respectively). Measurement of cardiac function with cardiac catheterization at the age of 5 weeks revealed that PLN ablation improved cardiac function in CSQ-Tg mice without affecting heart rate and blood pressure. Furthermore, increases in atrial and lung weight, an index of congestion, were significantly inhibited by PLN ablation. These results suggest that PLN deletion would be a promising approach to improve both mortality and cardiac function in the heart failure."

We investigated the neural dynamics of dual-task interference on word production using event-related potentials (ERPs) with either tones or syllables as concurrent stimuli. Participants produced words from pictures in three conditions: without distractors, while passively listening to distractors and during a distractor detection task. Production latencies increased for tasks with higher attentional demand and were longer for syllables relative to tones. ERP analyses revealed common modulations by dual-task for verbal and non-verbal stimuli around 240 ms, likely corresponding to lexical selection. Modulations starting around 350 ms prior to vocal onset were only observed when verbal stimuli were involved. These later modulations, likely reflecting interference with phonological-phonetic encoding, were observed only when overlap between tasks was maximal and the same underlying neural circuits were engaged (cross-talk)."
https://openalex.org/W2566150847,"Background The detection of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infections in ruminants is crucial to control spread among animals and to humans. Cultivation of MAP is seen as the gold standard for detection, although it is very time consuming and labour intensive. In addition, several PCR assays have been developed to detect MAP in around 90 minutes, but these assays required highly sophisticated equipment as well as lengthy and complicated procedure. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we have developed a rapid assay for the detection of MAP based on the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay targeting a MAP specific region, the IS900 gene. The detection limit was 16 DNA molecules in 15 minutes as determined by the probit analysis on eight runs of the plasmid standard. Cross reactivity with other mycobacterial and environmentally associated bacterial strains was not observed. The clinical performance of the MAP RPA assay was tested using 48 MAP-positive and 20 MAP-negative blood, sperm, faecal and tissue samples. All results were compared with reads of a highly sensitive real-time PCR assay. The specificity of the MAP RPA assay was 100%, while the sensitivity was 89.5%. Conclusions/Significance The RPA assay is quicker and much easier to handle than real-time PCR. All RPA reagents were cold-chain independent. Moreover, combining RPA assay with a simple extraction protocol will maximize its use at point of need for rapid detection of MAP."

Null mutants of bciD, which encodes a putative radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) protein, are unable to synthesize BChl e but accumulate BChl c; however, it is unknown whether BciD is sufficient to convert BChl c (or its precursor, bacteriochlorophyllide (BChlide) c) into BChl e (or BChlide e). To determine the function of BciD, we expressed the bciD gene of Chlorobaculum limnaeum strain DSMZ 1677T in Escherichia coli and purified the enzyme under anoxic conditions. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of BciD indicated that it contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster. In assays containing SAM, BChlide c or d, and sodium dithionite, BciD catalyzed the conversion of SAM into 5′-deoxyadenosine and BChlide c or d into BChlide e or f, respectively. Our analyses also identified intermediates that are proposed to be 71-OH-BChlide c and d. Thus, BciD is a radical SAM enzyme that converts the methyl group of BChlide c or d into the formyl group of BChlide e or f. This probably occurs by a mechanism involving consecutive hydroxylation reactions of the C-7 methyl group to form a geminal diol intermediate, which spontaneously dehydrates to produce the final products, BChlide e or BChlide f.

https://openalex.org/W2566350735,"In order to conduct early therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), convenient, early diagnosis markers are required. We previously reported that changes in DNA methylation levels were associated with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD. As the results suggested changes in DNA methylation levels in the COASY and SPINT1 gene promoter regions, in the present study we examined DNA methylation in these regions in normal controls (NCs, n = 30), aMCI subjects (n = 28) and AD subjects (n = 30) using methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) analysis. The results indicated that DNA methylation in the two regions was significantly increased in AD and aMCI as compared to NCs (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, ANOVA). Further analysis suggested that DNA methylation in the COASY gene promoter region in particular could be a high sensitivity, high specificity diagnosis biomarker (COASY: sensitivity 96.6%, specificity 96.7%; SPINT1: sensitivity 63.8%, specificity 83.3%). DNA methylation in the COASY promoter region was associated with CDR Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an indicator of dementia severity. In the SPINT1 promoter region, DNA methylation was negatively associated with age in NCs and elevated in aMCI and AD subjects positive for antibodies to Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). These findings suggested that changes in DNA methylation in the COASY and SPINT1 promoter regions are influenced by various factors. In conclusion, DNA methylation levels in the COASY and SPINT1 promoter regions were considered to potentially be a convenient and useful biomarker for diagnosis of AD and aMCI."

The results showed that the level of dissolved Ni in the anaerobic growth medium did not notably affect CH4 production in the cytochrome-free methanogenic species Methanobacterium bryantii and Methanoculleus bourgensis MAB1, but affected CH4 formation rate in the cytochrome-containing Methanosarcina barkeri grown on H2 and CO2. Methanosarcina barkeri also had the highest amounts of Ni in its cells, indicating that more Ni is needed by cytochrome-containing than by cytochrome-free methanogenic species. The concentration of Ni affected threshold values of H2 partial pressure (pH2) for all three methanogen species studied, with M. bourgensis MAB1 reaching pH2 values as low as 0.1 Pa when Ni was available in amounts used in normal anaerobic growth medium. To our knowledge, this is the lowest pH2 threshold recorded to date in pure methanogen culture, which suggests that M.bourgensis MAB1 have a competitive advantage over other species through its ability to grow at low H2 concentrations. Our study has implications for research on the H2-driven deep subsurface biosphere and biogas reactor performance."
https://openalex.org/W2564947101,"The small GTPase RhoA regulates the actin cytoskeleton to affect multiple cellular processes including endocytosis, migration and adhesion. RhoA activity is tightly regulated through several mechanisms including GDP/GTP cycling, phosphorylation, glycosylation and prenylation. Previous reports have also reported that cleavage of the carboxy-terminus inactivates RhoA. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of RhoA proteolysis that generates a stable amino-terminal RhoA fragment (RhoA-NTF). RhoA-NTF is detectable in healthy cells and tissues and is upregulated following cell stress. Overexpression of either RhoA-NTF or the carboxy-terminal RhoA cleavage fragment (RhoA-CTF) induces the formation of disorganized actin stress fibres. RhoA-CTF also promotes the formation of disorganized actin stress fibres and nuclear actin rods. Both fragments disrupt the organization of actin stress fibres formed by endogenous RhoA. Together, our findings describe a novel RhoA regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2566069871,"Background The epidemiology of incident syphilis infection among HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) largely remains unknown. Methods The incidence and risk factors for incident syphilis (positive TPHA and RPR> = 1:8) among HIV-1-infected MSM who visited a large HIV clinic in Tokyo for the first time between 2008 and 2013 were determined, using clinical data and stored blood samples taken every three months for screening and determination of the date of incident syphilis. Poisson regression compared the incidence of syphilis at different observation periods. Results Of 885 HIV-1-infected MSM with baseline data, 34% either presented with active syphilis at baseline (21%) or became infected with syphilis during follow-up (13%). After excluding 214 patients (MSM with syphilis at baseline (n = 190) and no follow-up syphilis test (n = 24)), of 671 men, 112 (17%) developed incident syphilis with an incidence of 43.7/1,000 person-years [95% CI, 36.5–52.3]. The incidence decreased slightly during observation period although the trend was not significant (2008–2009: 48.2/1,000 person-years, 2010–2011: 51.1/1,000 person-years, 2012–2013: 42.6/1,000 person-years, 2014 to 2015: 37.9/1,000 person-years, p = 0.315). Multivariable analysis identified young age (<33 years versus >40, HR 4.0, 95%CI 2.22–7.18, p<0.001), history of syphilis at baseline (HR 3.0, 95%CI 2.03–4.47, p<0.001), positive anti-amoeba antibody (HR 1.8, 95%CI 1.17–2.68, p = 0.006), and high baseline CD4 count (CD4 ≥350 /μL versus CD4 <200, HR 1.6, 95%CI 1.00–2.53, p = 0.050) as risk factors for incident syphilis. Incidence of syphilis was particularly high among young patients (age <33 years: 60.1/1,000 person-years). Interestingly, 37% of patients with incident syphilis were asymptomatic. Conclusions Although incidence of syphilis did not increase during the observation period, it was high among HIV-1-infected MSM, especially among young HIV-1-infected MSM and those with history of syphilis, in Tokyo. Regular screening for syphilis needs to be strictly applied to this population."
https://openalex.org/W2561682087,"Cell-free protein synthesis, which mimics the biological protein production system, allows rapid expression of proteins without the need to maintain a viable cell. Nevertheless, cell-free protein expression relies on active in vivo translation machinery including ribosomes and translation factors. Here, we examined the integrity of the protein synthesis machinery, namely the functionality of ribosomes, during (i) the cell-free extract preparation and (ii) the performance of in vitro protein synthesis by analyzing crucial components involved in translation. Monitoring the 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, elongation factors and ribosomal protein S1, we show that processing of a cell-free extract results in no substantial alteration of the translation machinery. Moreover, we reveal that the 16S rRNA is specifically cleaved at helix 44 during in vitro translation reactions, resulting in the removal of the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence. These defective ribosomes accumulate in the cell-free system. We demonstrate that the specific cleavage of the 16S rRNA is triggered by the decreased concentrations of Mg2+. In addition, we provide evidence that helix 44 of the 30S ribosomal subunit serves as a point-of-entry for ribosome degradation in Escherichia coli. Our results suggest that Mg2+ homeostasis is fundamental to preserving functional ribosomes in cell-free protein synthesis systems, which is of major importance for cell-free protein synthesis at preparative scale, in order to create highly efficient technical in vitro systems."

https://openalex.org/W2566112771,"Background Children born after preeclampsia may have a dominant androgen profile in puberty compared with other children. Circulating androgen concentrations at 11–12 years of age were compared between offspring born after preeclampsia, and children whose mothers did not have preeclampsia. Methods A total of 611 mother-offspring pairs were followed up 11 (daughters) or 12 (sons) years after birth: 218 pairs in the preeclampsia group, and 383 pairs without preeclampsia. Circulating total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were measured in the children. In boys, testicular volume was also measured. Results Among girls born after preeclampsia, DHEAS concentrations were higher than in unexposed girls (p<0.001), however, girls born after preeclampsia with severe features had the lowest DHEAS levels. In contrast, testosterone concentrations were highest in girls born after preeclampsia with severe features, both compared to other girls in the preeclampsia group, and compared to unexposed girls (p<0.001). For boys, testosterone concentrations were higher in the preeclampsia group compared with unexposed boys (p<0.001), and boys born after preeclampsia with severe features had the lowest concentrations of DHEAS. Compared with unexposed boys, testicular volume (p = 0.015) and IGF-I (p = 0.004) were higher for boys in the preeclampsia group, except for boys in the clinically severe preeclampsia group. Conclusions In utero exposure to preeclampsia is associated with androgen hormonal patterns in early puberty that depend on clinical severity of preeclampsia and sex of the offspring. The hormonal differences may reflect different timing of pubertal development, and may have consequences for future health of the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2564166541,"The balance of protein synthesis and proteolysis (i.e. proteostasis) is maintained by a complex regulatory network in which mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin serine/threonine kinase) pathway and unfolded protein response are prominent positive and negative actors. The interplay between the two systems has been revealed; however the mechanistic details of this crosstalk are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the elements of crosstalk during endoplasmic reticulum stress and to verify the key role of GADD34 in the connection with the mTOR pathway. Here, we demonstrate that a transient activation of autophagy is present in endoplasmic reticulum stress provoked by thapsigargin or tunicamycin, which is turned into apoptotic cell death. The transient phase can be characterized by the elevation of the autophagic marker LC3II/I, by mTOR inactivation, AMP-activated protein kinase activation and increased GADD34 level. The switch from autophagy to apoptosis is accompanied with the appearance of apoptotic markers, mTOR reactivation, AMP-activated protein kinase inactivation and a decrease in GADD34. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine shortens the transient phase, while inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or resveratrol prolongs it. Inhibition of GADD34 by guanabenz or transfection of the cells with siGADD34 results in down-regulation of autophagy-dependent survival and a quick activation of mTOR, followed by apoptotic cell death. The negative effect of GADD34 inhibition is diminished when guanabenz or siGADD34 treatment is combined with rapamycin or resveratrol addition. These data confirm that GADD34 constitutes a mechanistic link between endoplasmic reticulum stress and mTOR inactivation, therefore promotes cell survival during endoplasmic reticulum stress."

We compare the performance of our approach with three state-of-the-art segmentation techniques, using three error metrics. The results show that leaf tips are detected with roughly one half of the original error, segmentation accuracy is almost always improved and more than half of the leaf breakages are corrected."

To assess the extent of finger independency during full-range finger flexion including all finger joints, we studied enslaving (movement in non-instructed fingers) and range of independent finger movement through the whole finger flexion trajectory in single and multi-finger movement tasks. Thirteen young healthy subjects performed single- and multi-finger movement tasks under two conditions: active flexion through the full range of movement with all fingers free to move and active flexion while the non-instructed finger(s) were restrained. Finger kinematics were measured using inertial sensors (PowerGlove), to assess enslaving and range of independent finger movement. Although all fingers showed enslaving movement to some extent, highest enslaving was found in adjacent fingers. Enslaving effects in ring and little finger were increased with movement of additional, non-adjacent fingers. The middle finger was the only finger affected by restriction in movement of non-instructed fingers. Each finger showed a range of independent movement before the non-instructed fingers started to move, which was largest for the index finger. The start of enslaving was asymmetrical for adjacent fingers. Little finger enslaving movement was affected by multi-finger movement. We conclude that no finger can move independently through the full range of finger flexion, although some degree of full independence is present for smaller movements. This range of independent movement is asymmetric and variable between fingers and between subjects. The presented results provide insight into the role of finger independency for different types of tasks and populations."

Recombinant vaccines were produced in Escherichia coli by fusing the VLRB sequence to 4 different cancer-associated target molecules. The anti–self-immune response generated in mice that were vaccinated with VLRB vaccines was compared with the response in mice that received vaccines that contained bacterial thioredoxin (TRX), previously identified as an efficient carrier. The anti–self-Abs were analyzed with respect to titers, binding properties, and duration of response. VLRB-vaccinated mice displayed a 2- to 10-fold increase in anti–self-Ab titers and a substantial decrease in Abs against the foreign part of the fusion protein compared with the response in TRX-vaccinated mice (P < 0.01). VLRB-generated Ab response had duration similar to the corresponding TRX-generated Abs, but displayed a higher diversity in binding characteristics. Of importance, VLRB vaccines could sustain an immune response against several targets simultaneously.

However, the impacts of N fertilization rates on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) were controversial. Five N rates (N0, N45, N90, N135, and N180) were applied to a continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop on the semi-arid Loess Plateau, and the in situ soil respiration was monitored during five consecutive years from 2008 to 2013. During the growing season, the mean soil respiration rates increased with increasing N fertilization rates, peaking at 1.53 μmol m-2s-1 in the N135 treatment. A similar dynamic pattern was observed during the non-growing season, yet on average with 7.3% greater soil respiration rates than the growing season. In general for all the N fertilization treatments, the mean Q10 value during the non-growing season was significantly greater than that during the growing season. As N fertilization rates increased, the Q10 values did not change significantly in the growing season but significantly decreased in the non-growing season. Overall, N fertilization markedly influenced soil respirations and Q10 values, in particular posing distinct effects on the Q10 values between the growing and non-growing seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2565765048,"Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a lipogenic transcription factor that is thought to be involved in the development of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Increased ChREBP expression in liver results in increased hepatic steatosis, and the isoform ChREBPβ in adipose tissue can predict insulin sensitivity in obese humans. As ChREBP is activated by glucose, it was postulated that the composition of diet would regulate ChREBP isoform expression in metabolically relevant tissues. We compared the effects of diets with high complex carbohydrate, high fat, or a normal chow on ChREBP expression and metabolic parameters in C57BL/6 mice. We found that diets high in fat decrease ChREBP expression in adipose tissue, but isocaloric diets high in carbohydrate have no effect. Interestingly, this decrease in adipose ChREBP was associated with increased inflammatory markers. In the same animals a high carbohydrate diet induced a robust increase in hepatic ChREBPβ expression (≈2-fold; p = 0.0002), but little detectable change in the more abundant ChREBPα transcript. This change was accompanied by increased expression of target genes liver pyruvate kinase (p<0.0001), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p = 0.0191) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p = 0.0045). This increase in ChREBP expression was associated with increased hepatic steatosis, despite no changes in body weight or body fat when compared to chow-fed mice. Unexpectedly, mice fed a high carbohydrate diet displayed enhanced sensitivity to exogenous insulin, despite having mild glucose intolerance and increased liver steatosis. In summary, we have shown the composition of diet can selectively regulate ChREBP isoform expression in a tissue specific manner. Furthermore, we have shown a high complex carbohydrate diet selectively increases hepatic ChREBPβ expression, which associates with hepatic steatosis but not insulin resistance. In contrast, a high fat diet reduces adipose ChREBP, which associates with inflammation and insulin resistance."

However, the function and the mechanism of WDR1 in mammalian early development are still largely unclear. We now report that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri-implantation development and regulates Cofilin phosphorylation in mouse cells. The disruption of maternal WDR1 does not obviously affect ovulation and female fertility. However, depletion of zygotic WDR1 results in embryonic lethality at the peri-implantation stage. In WDR1 knock-out cells, we found that WDR1 regulates Cofilin phosphorylation. Interestingly, WDR1 is overdosed to regulate Cofilin phosphorylation in mouse cells. Furthermore, we showed that WDR1 interacts with Lim domain kinase 1 (LIMK1), a well known phosphorylation kinase of Cofilin. Altogether, our results provide new insights into the role and mechanism of WDR1 in physiological conditions.

The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic structure that regulates cell motility, adhesion, division, and growth and has a fundamental function in embryonic development (1Schejter E.D. Wieschaus E.

Actin-depolymerizing factor Cofilin plays critical roles in the modulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics (7Bernstein B.W. Bamburg J.R.

In vitro, Cofilin severs actin filament at low concentrations, whereas it fully decorates actin filaments and suppresses the severing activity at high concentrations (8Andrianantoandro E.

In addition, Cofilin severing F-actin is not explained well for how the filaments of actin cytoskeleton can be rapidly disassembled in physiological conditions (4Brieher W. Mechanisms of actin disassembly.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 2299-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of Cofilin in actin dynamics depends not only on its relative concentration to actin, but also on other regulatory proteins in vivo. Dysfunction of these regulating proteins results in aberrant actin cytoskeleton in various cellular and developmental processes (10Ohashi K.

However, the phosphorylation of Cofilin at Ser-3 blocks its binding site to actin (14Kaji N. Muramoto A. Mizuno K.

Thus, the activity of Cofilin is controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes, which are regulated by cascade reactions of several protein kinases and phosphatases.

The activity of Cofilin on actin disassembly is greatly accelerated by other actin-binding proteins (24Cooper J.A. Schafer D.A. Control of actin assembly and disassembly at filament ends.Curr. Opin.

WDR1 (WD40 domain repeat 1, also known as actin interaction protein 1), is conserved and was originally identified as an actin-binding protein by a yeast two-hybrid screen (26Rodal A.A.

WDR1 is involved in actin dynamics by promoting the actin disassembly activity of Cofilin. Mutations in WDR1 result in abnormal cytoskeletal behavior in many organisms (27Kile B.T. Panopoulos A.D.

A Gene-trap vector inserted Wdr1 intron 2 disrupts its expression completely and results in embryonic lethality before E10.5 (embryonic day 10.5) in mice, whereas a hypomorphic insertion mutation in this gene leads to autoinflammatory disease because of the impairment of cytoskeletal response in neutrophils and thrombopoiesis (27Kile B.T.

In humans, the aberrant expressions of WDR1 have been shown to be connected to several diseases, including gout, pancreatitis, and primary glioblastoma (32Liu L.J. Zhang X.Y. He N. Liu K. Shi X.G. Feng T. Geng T.T. Yuan D.Y. Kang L.L. Jin T.B. Genetic variation in WDR1 is associated with gout risk and gout-related metabolic indices in the Han Chinese population.Genet. Mol.

Res. 2016; 8: 1253-1264PubMed Google Scholar). Although WDR1 is critical for numerous physiological conditions, how it acts in early embryonic development remains largely unclear. In our study, we demonstrated that zygotic, but not maternal, expression of WDR1 is important for mouse early embryonic development. We showed that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri-implantation development. Most interestingly, we found that WDR1 regulates the level of Cofilin phosphorylation through LIMK, a novel mechanism of WDR1 involved in Cofilin activity. To investigate the function of Wdr1 in oocyte maturation and pre-implantation embryogenesis, we first examined the expression of Wdr1 in mouse oocytes and pre-implantation embryos by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Our results showed that Wdr1 mRNA was highly expressed in mouse germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, decreased in metaphase II (MII) oocytes, 1-cell, 2-cell, and morula stage embryos, and then sharply increased in blastocyst stage embryos (Fig. 1A). By comparison, Western blotting analysis showed that WDR1 protein was comparatively highly expressed in GV oocytes, decreased in MII oocytes, increased in 1-cell and 2-cell embryos, and decreased in morula and blastocyst stage embryos again (Fig. 1B). We generated Wdr1 oocyte-specific knock-out mice by mating Wdr1f/f mice with Zp3-cre transgenic mice to study the role of WDR1 in female fertility. The mRNA and protein of Wdr1 were dramatically decreased in the GV oocytes from Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre (oocyte-specific knock-out, oKO) females as noted by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1, C and D). However, Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre females delivered comparable offspring compared with the controls (Wdr1f/f and Wdr1f/+; Zp3-cre females) after mating with Wdr1f/f males (Fig. 1E). These data demonstrated that maternal WDR1 is not required for Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre female fertility. We also mated Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre females with Wdr1f/− males. The litter size was decreased to about 50% (Fig. 1E), indicating Wdr1 KO embryos was lost during embryonic development, consistent with a previous report in which severe loss function of WDR1 resulted in embryonic lethality before E10.5 (27Kile B.T. Panopoulos A.D. Stirzaker R.A. Hacking D.F. Tahtamouni L.H. Willson T.A. Mielke L.A. Henley K.J. Zhang J.G. Wicks I.P. Stevenson W.S. Nurden P. Watowich S.S. Justice M.J. Mutations in the cofilin partner Aip1/Wdr1 cause autoinflammatory disease and macrothrombocytopenia.Blood. 2007; 110: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggested that zygotic, but not maternal, expression of Wdr1 is required for mouse development. To examine the causes and time point of Wdr1 KO embryo lethality, Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre and Wdr1f/f female mice mated with Wdr1f/− male mice and the deciduas were analyzed at E5.5. Our results showed that the number of deciduas per litter was 7–10 in both groups and were not obviously different from each other (Fig. 2A). However, after sectioning and H&E staining of these deciduas, 53% of the deciduas from Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre females had normal embryos (Fig. 2B (a)), and 47% had no embryos (Fig. 2B (b)), whereas the percentage of empty deciduas from Wdr1f/f females (control) was only 3% (Fig. 2B, right panel). These data indicated that the blastocysts lacking WDR1 were able to implant and induce the decidualization, but were absorbed at E5.5, suggesting that WDR1 is essential for mouse peri-implantation development. To further investigate Wdr1 KO embryonic development, blastocysts were obtained from the uteruses of the Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre females after mating with Wdr1f/− males at E3.5 and cultured in vitro. KO and control blastocysts could not be distinguished at E3.5 (Fig. 2C). All blastocysts grew, hatched, and adhered to the dish during the first 2 days of culturing. However, 55% (11 of 20) of embryos grew obviously smaller at the third day. No EdU incorporation was detected in the smaller embryos (Fig. 2D). We then examined the genotypes of these embryos by PCR with specific primers and found that the genotype of 81% (9 of 11) of the smaller embryos were Wdr1−/− (Fig. 2E). These data suggest loss of WDR1 has no obvious effect on blastocyst development, but cause the arrested development after adherence in vitro. To investigate WDR1 functions in early embryos, we established ES cell lines from Wdr1f/− (control, CTL) and Wdr1−/− (knock-out, KO) blastocysts from Wdr1f/f; Zp3-cre females after mating with Wdr1f/− males. The Wdr1 mRNA and protein deletion were examined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis in these ES cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B). Wdr1 KO ES cells could be normally maintained in a 2i/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) medium and form typical clones (Fig. 3D). The expression of pluripotent markers such as NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2, and the cells proliferation were comparable in CTL and KO ES (Fig. 3, B and C). To investigate their differentiation potentials, CTL and KO ES cells were labeled with EGFP and injected into normal blastocysts. These blastocysts were cultured for 3 days in an in vitro system of growing whole embryos. Our results showed that both CTL and KO ES cells incorporated into the cultured embryos detected by EGFP (Fig. 3D). The defect of Wdr1 disruption on differentiation was further examined by embryoid bodies (EB) formation system, a model of ESC differentiation into germ layer lineages. Compared with their expressions at day 0 (d0), germ layer makers (Sox17, endoderm; T, mesoderm; Pax6, ectoderm) were comparably up-regulated in both CTL and KO EB at day 3 (d3) (Fig. 3E). These results indicate that WDR1 depletion may not affect the ES cells potential of differentiation. Previous reports showed that WDR1 partial dysfunction (decreased to 20%) affected actin structure and depolarized Cofilin localization in migrating cells (27Kile B.T. Panopoulos A.D. Stirzaker R.A. Hacking D.F. Tahtamouni L.H. Willson T.A. Mielke L.A. Henley K.J. Zhang J.G. Wicks I.P. Stevenson W.S. Nurden P. Watowich S.S. Justice M.J. Mutations in the cofilin partner Aip1/Wdr1 cause autoinflammatory disease and macrothrombocytopenia.Blood. 2007; 110: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Then, we examined F-actin and Cofilin in Wdr1 KO ES cells by immunofluorescence. F-actin (red) was concentrated in the membrane in both knock-out ES cells and controls (Fig. 3F). The detailed actin structure could not be observed clearly in these cells. Surprisingly, different from WDR1 dysfunction in migrating cells (27Kile B.T. Panopoulos A.D. Stirzaker R.A. Hacking D.F. Tahtamouni L.H. Willson T.A. Mielke L.A. Henley K.J. Zhang J.G. Wicks I.P. Stevenson W.S. Nurden P. Watowich S.S. Justice M.J. Mutations in the cofilin partner Aip1/Wdr1 cause autoinflammatory disease and macrothrombocytopenia.Blood. 2007; 110: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Cofilin was more concentrated to the membrane and co-located with actin filaments in Wdr1−/− ES cells, whereas it was more diffused in control (Fig. 3F). We also investigated phosphorylated Cofilin (P-Cofilin) by Western blotting analysis. Our results showed that the P-Cofilin level was much lower in Wdr1−/− ES cells than that in control (Fig. 3G). Then, we separated G-actin and F-actin from KO and control ES cells (35Huang W. Zhu P.J. Zhang S. Zhou H. Stoica L. Galiano M. Krnjević K. Roman G. Costa-Mattioli M. mTORC2 controls actin polymerization required for consolidation of long-term memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Distinct from a previous report in Wdr1 knockdown cells (36Luxenburg C. Heller E. Pasolli H.A. Chai S. Nikolova M. Stokes N. Fuchs E. Wdr1-mediated cell shape dynamics and cortical tension are essential for epidermal planar cell polarity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), F-actin level was not obviously increased in Wdr1 KO ES cells as compared with the control (Fig. 3H). Altogether, Wdr1 KO has no obvious impact on ES pluripotency and growth, but results in dramatically decreased P-Cofilin in these cells. Interestingly, WDR1 expression is much higher in MEF cells than that in ES cells (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the effects of WDR1 on actin cytoskeleton, knock-out MEF cell lines were established by a tamoxifen induction system. Wdr1f/−; Cre-ERTM fetuses were used to establish inducible knock-out (iKO) MEF lines, using Wdr1+/−; Cre-ERTM MEF cells as the control (CTL). After 72 h treatment with tamoxifen, Wdr1 mRNA and protein were decreased to 0.3 ± 0.018% and 4.5 ± 0.2%, respectively, compared with control (CTL) (Fig. 4, B and C). Actin plaques were observed in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells, whereas the clear linear F-actin structure was shown in the control (Fig. 4D). However, we did not detect a significant increase in the overall F-actin level in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells (Fig. 4E). P-Cofilin was observed to be dramatically decreased in Wdr1 iKO MEF cells (Fig. 4F). We also examined the cell cycle by flow cytometry. Our results showed that control MEF cells had complete G1, S, and G2 cell stages, whereas Wdr1 iKO MEF cells lost S stage and expanded G2 stage (Fig. 4G). These data suggested that the WDR1 loss affected MEF cell proliferation. Altogether, our results indicate that WDR1 regulates the formation of special actin plaques, the proliferation, and Cofilin phosphorylation in MEF cells. The dramatically decreased P-Cofilin in Wdr1 KO cells was inconsistent with a previous report for Wdr1 knockdown cells (36Luxenburg C. Heller E. Pasolli H.A. Chai S. Nikolova M. Stokes N. Fuchs E. Wdr1-mediated cell shape dynamics and cortical tension are essential for epidermal planar cell polarity.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting WDR1 might be overdosed in cells to regulate Cofilin phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used the tamoxifen induction system to gradually reduce WDR1 content and examined the level of P-Cofilin during this process. WDR1, P-Cofilin, and Cofilin were detected in Wdr1f/−; Cre-ERTM and control MEF cells after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h tamoxifen treatments. In Wdr1f/−; Cre-ERTM MEF cells, WDR1 protein gradually reduced at the time course manner and almost failed to be detected at 72 h (Fig. 5A). Although the protein levels of WDR1 were obviously decreased at 24 and 48 h, P-Cofilin was comparable with the control at these time points. The decreased P-Cofilin was only clearly observed at 72 h after tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 5A). Consistently, the actin plaques were obviously observed at 72 h, but could not be found at 24 h and only a small number of actin plaques were observed at 48 h (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that WDR1 regulating Cofilin phosphorylation is overdosed in cells. To further examine the regulation of WDR1 on Cofilin phosphorylation, WDR1 was overexpressed in both ES and MEF cells. Cofilin phosphorylation was not obviously different in both WDR1 overexpressed and control cells (Fig. 5, C and D). When WDR1 was re-expressed in knock-out ES cells, P-Cofilin was obviously increased and comparable with the control (Fig. 5E). To investigate how WDR1 regulates Cofilin phosphorylation, WDR1 with a FLAG tag was overexpressed in MEF cells and an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment was performed with FLAG antibody. Our results showed that WDR1 precipitated LIMK1, but not SSH1, PDXP, or TESK1 (Fig. 6A). We further docked the binding domains of LIMK1 in 293T cells (Fig. 6B). Our results showed that LIMK1-FL and LIMK1–415, but not LIMK1–766, pulled down WDR1 (Fig. 6B). We also examined the levels of P-LIMK1 and total LIMK1 in control and Wdr1 KO MEF cells. Our results showed that both P-LIMK1 and total LIMK1 levels were almost similar in control and KO MEF cells (Fig. 6C). Previous reports showed that LIMK1 activity was inhibited by binding with BMP-RII (bone morphogenetic proteins receptor II) or microtubules (21Foletta V.C. Lim M.A. Soosairajah J. Kelly A.P.

Because the LIMK1 antibody did not work well for immunostaining, LIMK1 with the Myc tag was overexpressed in control and Wdr1 KO MEF cells to examine whether WDR1 regulates LIMK1 by changing its localization. Our results showed that LIMK1 was diffused in both control and KO MEF cells, but was more concentrated to microtubules in Wdr1 KO MEF cells. We then treated the MEF cells to lightly damage the microtubule structure with a small dosage of nocodazol (1.25 μg/ml), a microtubules depolymerization reagent, and examined P-Cofilin by Western blotting analysis in these cells. Our results showed that P-Cofilin was up-regulated in Wdr1 KO MEF cells, but was virtually unchanged in the controls (Fig. 6E). Our IP experiment showed that WDR1 interacts with the PDZ domain of LIMK1, which is a microtubule binding domain (17Edwards D.C. Gill G.N. Structural features of LIM kinase that control effects on the actin cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11352-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that WDR1 might regulate LIMK1 function by inhibiting its binding to microtubules. To examine effects of WDR1 loss on F-actin and Cofilin phosphorylation during embryonic development, the blastocysts cultured in vitro for 3 days were stained by phalloidin. Actin filaments were orderly and homogeneous in the control (CTL), whereas random actin plaques were observed in Wdr1−/− (knock-out, KO) blastocyst outgrowth (Fig. 7A). The P-Cofilin level in KO outgrowth was much lower than that in control (Fig. 7B). F-actin and P-Cofilin were also examined in mouse GV oocytes by staining and Western blotting analysis. Our results showed that actin was concentrated to some small plaques in the cytoplasm of Wdr1−/− (oKO) GV oocytes (Fig. 7C, arrowheads), and uniformly distributed in Wdr1f/f (CTL) (Fig. 7C). P-Cofilin was also dramatically decreased in Wdr1−/− GV oocytes compared with the control (Fig. 7D). WDR1 and its involvement in actin cytoskeleton play important roles in multiple processes during mouse development (27Kile B.T. Panopoulos A.D. Stirzaker R.A. Hacking D.F. Tahtamouni L.H.

https://openalex.org/W2565610617,"Widespread ocean acidification (OA) is transforming the chemistry of the global ocean, and the Arctic is recognised as a region where the earliest and strongest impacts of OA are expected. In the present study, metabolic effects of OA and its interaction with food availability was investigated in Calanus glacialis from the Kongsfjord, West Spitsbergen. We measured metabolic rates and RNA/DNA ratios (an indicator of biosynthesis) concurrently in fed and unfed individuals of copepodite stages CII-CIII and CV subjected to two different pH levels representative of present day and the “business as usual” IPCC scenario (RCP8.5) prediction for the year 2100. The copepods responded more strongly to changes in food level than to decreasing pH, both with respect to metabolic rate and RNA/DNA ratio. However, significant interactions between effects of pH and food level showed that effects of pH and food level act in synergy in copepodites of C. glacialis. While metabolic rates in copepodites stage CII-CIII increased by 78% as a response to food under present day conditions (high pH), the increase was 195% in CII-CIIIs kept at low pH—a 2.5 times greater increase. This interaction was absent for RNA/DNA, so the increase in metabolic rates were clearly not a reaction to changing biosynthesis at low pH per se but rather a reaction to increased metabolic costs per unit of biosynthesis. Interestingly, we did not observe this difference in costs of growth in stage CV. A 2.5 times increase in metabolic costs of growth will leave the copepodites with much less energy for growth. This may infer significant changes to the C. glacialis population during future OA."

Forty-eight human ABC transporters have been identified in the genome, and the majority of these are linked to heritable disease. Mutations in the ABCC6 (ATP binding cassette transporter C6) ABC transporter are associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a disease of altered elastic properties in multiple tissues. Although ∼200 mutations have been identified in pseudoxanthoma elasticum patients, the underlying structural defects associated with the majority of these are poorly understood. To evaluate the structural consequences of these missense mutations, a combination of biophysical and cell biological approaches were applied to evaluate the local and global folding and assembly of the ABCC6 protein. Structural and bioinformatic analyses suggested that a cluster of mutations, representing roughly 20% of the patient population with identified missense mutations, are located in the interface between the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal nucleotide binding domain. Biochemical and cell biological analyses demonstrate these mutations influence multiple steps in the biosynthetic pathway, minimally altering local domain structure but adversely impacting ABCC6 assembly and trafficking. The differential impacts on local and global protein structure are consistent with hierarchical folding and assembly of ABCC6. Stabilization of specific domain-domain interactions via targeted amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of the C-terminal nucleotide binding domain restored proper protein trafficking and cell surface localization of multiple biosynthetic mutants. This rescue provides a specific mechanism by which chemical chaperones could be developed for the correction of ABCC6 biosynthetic defects.

https://openalex.org/W2567234428,"Previous epidemiologic studies have shown that elevated resting heart rate (HR) is associated with higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Although the relationship between elevated HR and CVD is well established, the association between resting HR and diabetes has been relatively understudied, particularly in non-Western populations.We confirmed the association between the presence of type 2 diabetes and resting HR in the Korean adult population using data from the 2010-2013 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES).Among 25,712 adults (≥ 19 years of age) who participated in the 2010-2013 KNHANES, a total of 22,512 subjects completed laboratory examinations and were included in this analysis. The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was categorized into the following five groups: normal fasting glucose (NFG) 1 (<90 mg/dL), NFG 2 (90-99 mg/dL), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) 1 (100-110 mg/dL), IFG 2 (111-125 mg/dL), and diabetes (≥ 126 mg/dL).The unadjusted weighted resting HRs were 69.6, 69.4, 69.8, 70.1, and 72.0 beats per minute (bpm) in the NFG 1, NFG 2, IFG 1, IFG 2, and diabetes groups, respectively (P<0.001). We assessed the adjusted weighted resting HR according to the FPG level after adjusting for age, sex, smoking history, high risk alcohol drinking, daily energy intake, waist circumference, serum total cholesterol level, serum triglyceride (TG) level, serum white blood cell (WBC) count, serum hemoglobin (Hb), and the presence of hypertension. The adjusted weighted resting HR significantly increased across the FPG groups (P<0.001). The weighted prevalence rates of diabetes were 6.8% (6.2-7.5%), 7.6% (6.7-8.5%), 8.0% (7.0-9.1%), and 11.8% (10.8-12.7%) in subjects with HR ≤ 64, 65-69, 70-75, and ≥ 76 bpm, respectively (P<0.001), after adjusting for the confounding factors mentioned above. Using resting HR ≤ 64 bpm as the control, resting HR ≥ 76 bpm was correlated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.55-2.16, P<0.001). Each 10 bpm increment of HR increased the risk of the presence of diabetes by 35% (P<0.001). This association of high resting HR with the presence of diabetes was not influenced by the status of blood pressure (BP) medication.We demonstrated that higher HR was associated with diabetes in a representative sample of Korean adults. These positive associations were independent of age, sex, current smoking, high risk alcohol drinking, daily energy intake, waist circumference, and the presence of hypertension and other potential confounders. This study suggests that individuals with higher resting HR are at risk of diabetes and that HR might provide an easy and simple surrogate marker for the risk of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2560883026,"The opinions about optimal proportions of macronutrients in a healthy diet have changed significantly over the last century. At the same time nutritional sciences failed to provide strong evidence backing up any of the variety of views on macronutrient proportions. Herein we present an idea how these proportions can be calculated to find an optimal balance of macronutrients with respect to prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and dementia. These calculations are based on our published observation that per capita personal income (PCPI) in the USA correlates with age-adjusted death rates for AD (AADR). We have previously reported that PCPI through the period 1925–2005 correlated with AADR in 2005 in a remarkable, statistically significant oscillatory manner, as shown by changes in the correlation coefficient R (Roriginal). A question thus arises what caused the oscillatory behavior of Roriginal? What historical events in the life of 2005 AD victims had shaped their future with AD? Looking for the answers we found that, considering changes in the per capita availability of macronutrients in the USA in the period 1929–2005, we can mathematically explain the variability of Roriginal for each quarter of a human life. On the basis of multiple regression of Roriginal with regard to the availability of three macronutrients: carbohydrates, total fat, and protein, with or without alcohol, we propose seven equations (referred to as “the calculator” throughout the text) which allow calculating optimal changes in the proportions of macronutrients to reduce the risk of AD for each age group: youth, early middle age, late middle age and late age. The results obtained with the use of “the calculator” are grouped in a table (Table 4) of macronutrient proportions optimal for reducing the risk of AD in each age group through minimizing Rpredicted−i.e., minimizing the strength of correlation between PCPI and future AADR."
https://openalex.org/W2562573819,"Low unit response rates can increase bias and compromise study validity. Response rates have continued to fall over the past decade despite all efforts to increase participation. Many factors have been linked to reduced response, yet relatively few studies have employed multivariate approaches to identify characteristics that differentiate respondents from nonrespondents since it is hard to collect information on the latter. We aimed to assess factors contributing to enrollment of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. We combined data from the North Carolina-Louisiana (LA) PCa Project’s LA cohort, with additional sources such as US census tract and LA tumor registry data. We included specific analyses focusing on blacks, a group often identified as hard to enroll in health-related research. The ability to study the effect of Hurricane Katrina, which occurred amidst enrollment, as a potential determinant of nonresponse makes our study unique. Older age (≥ 70) for blacks (OR 0.65) and study phase with respect to Hurricane Katrina for both races (OR 0.59 for blacks, OR 0.48 for whites) were significant predictors of participation with lower odds. Neighborhood poverty for whites (OR 1.53) also was a significant predictor of participation, but with higher odds. Among blacks, residence in Orleans parish was associated with lower odds of participation (OR 0.33) before Katrina. The opposite occurred in whites, with lower odds (OR 0.43) after Katrina. Our results overall underscore the importance of tailoring enrollment approaches to specific target population characteristics to confront the challenges posed by nonresponse. Our results also show that recruitment-related factors may change when outside forces bring major alterations to a population's environment and demographics."
https://openalex.org/W2567652199,"Tab2, originally described as a component of the inflammatory pathway, has been implicated in phenomena of gene de-repression in several contexts, due to its ability to interact with the NCoR corepressor. Tab2 interacts also with steroid receptors and dismisses NCoR from antagonist-bound Estrogen and Androgen Receptors on gene regulatory regions, thus modifying their transcriptional activity and leading to pharmacological resistance in breast and prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated previously that either Tab2 knock-down, or a peptide mimicking the Estrogen Receptor alpha domain interacting with Tab2, restore the antiproliferative response to Tamoxifen in Tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. In this work, we map the domain of Tab2 responsible of Estrogen Receptor alpha interaction. First, using both co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down with recombinant proteins, we found that the central part of Tab2 is primarily responsible for this interaction, and that this region also interacts with Androgen Receptor. Then, we narrowed down the essential interaction region by means of competition assays using recombinant protein pull-down. The interaction motif was finally identified as a small region adjacent to, but not overlapping, the Tab2 MEKK1 phosphorylation sites. A synthetic peptide mimicking this motif efficiently displaced Tab2 from interacting with recombinant Estrogen Receptor alpha in vitro, prompting us to test its efficacy using derivatives of the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell lines that are spontaneously resistant to Tamoxifen. Indeed, we observed that this mimic peptide, made cell-permeable by addition of the TAT minimal carrier domain, reduced the growth of Tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 cells in the presence of Tamoxifen. These data indicate a novel functional domain of the Tab2 protein with potential application in drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2565424895,"Node importance degree is a vital index in distribution network reconfiguration because it reflects the robustness of the network structure by evaluating node importance. Since the traditional reconfiguration ignores this index, the reconstructed network structure may be vulnerable which would reduce the security and stability of the distribution systems. This paper presents a novel reconfiguration strategy considering the node importance. The optimization objectives are the improvement of the node importance degree and the reduction of power loss. To balance the objectives, the reconfiguration mathematical model is formulated as a compound objective function with weight coefficients. Then the quantum particle swarm algorithm is employed to address this compound objective optimization problem. The strategy can model different scenarios network reconfiguration by adjusting the weight vector based on the tendencies of the utility decision maker. Illustrative examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2560913706,"Increased lymph node count (LNC) has been associated with prolonged survival in colorectal cancer (CRC), but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. The study aims to identify new predictors and develop a preoperative nomogram for predicting the probability of adequate LNC (≥ 12). 501 eligible patients were retrospectively selected to identify clinical-pathological factors associated with LNC ≥ 12 through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The nomogram was built according to multivariate analyses of preoperative factors. Model performance was assessed with concordance index (c-index) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), followed by internal validation and calibration using 1000-resample bootstrapping. Clinical validity of the nomogram and LNC impact on stage migration were also evaluated. Multivariate analyses showed patient age, CA19-9, circulating lymphocytes, neutrophils, platelets, tumor diameter, histology and deposit significantly correlated with LNC (P < 0.05). The effects were marginal for CEA, anemia and CRC location (0.05 < P < 0.1). The multivariate analyses of preoperative factors suggested decreased age, CEA, CA19-9, neutrophils, proximal location, and increased platelets and diameter were significantly associated with increased probability of LNC ≥ 12 (P < 0.05). The nomogram achieved c-indexes of 0.75 and 0.73 before and after correction for overfitting. The AUC was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.79) and the clinically valid threshold probabilities were between 10% and 60% for the nomogram to predict LNC < 12. Additionally, increased probability of adequate LNC before surgery was associated with increased LNC and negative lymph nodes rather than increased positive lymph nodes, lymph node ratio, pN stages or AJCC stages. Collectively, the results indicate the LNC is multifactorial and irrelevant to stage migration. The significant correlations with preoperative circulating markers may provide new explanations for LNC-related survival advantage which is reflected by the implication of regional and systemic antitumor immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2564808647,"Genetic polymorphisms in the RAS gene family are associated with different diseases, which may include alcohol-related disorders. Previous studies showed an association of the allelic variant rs26907 in RASGRF2 gene with higher alcohol intake. Additionally, the rs61764370 polymorphism in the KRAS gene is located in a binding site for the let-7 micro-RNA family, which is potentially involved in alcohol-induced inflammation. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the association between these two polymorphisms and susceptibility to alcoholism or alcoholic liver disease (ALD).We enrolled 301 male alcoholic patients and 156 healthy male volunteers in this study. Polymorphisms were genotyped by using TaqMan® PCR assays for allelic discrimination. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the inheritance model.The A allele of the RASGRF2 polymorphism (rs26907) was significantly more prevalent among alcoholic patients with cirrhosis (23.2%) compared to alcoholic patients without ALD (14.2%). This difference remained significant in the group of patients with alcohol dependence (28.8% vs. 14.3%) but not in those with alcohol abuse (15.1% vs. 14.4%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the A allele of this polymorphism (AA or GA genotype) was associated with alcoholic cirrhosis both in the total group of alcoholics (odds ratio [OR]: 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-4.11; P = 0.002) and in the group of patients with alcohol dependence (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.50-6.20; P = 0.001). Allelic distributions of the KRAS polymorphism (rs61764370) did not differ between the groups.To our knowledge, this genetic association study represents the first to show an association of the RASGRF2 G>A (rs26907) polymorphism with ALD in men, particularly in the subgroup of patients with AD. The findings suggest the potential relevance of the RAS gene family in alcoholism and ALD."
