https://openalex.org/W1594758412,"Tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) directly activate in vitro Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), which normally requires unsaturated diacylglycerol. Kinetic analysis indicates that TPA can substitute for diacylglycerol and greatly increases the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+ as well as for phospholipid. Under physiological conditions, the activation of this enzyme appears to be linked to the receptor-mediated phosphatidylinositol breakdown which may be provoked by a wide variety of extracellular messengers, eventually leading to the activation of specific cellular functions or proliferation. Using human platelets as a model system, TPA is shown to enhance the protein kinase C-specific phosphorylation associated with the release reaction in the total absence of phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Various phorbol derivatives which have been shown to be active in tumor promotion are also capable of activating this protein kinase in in vitro systems."
https://openalex.org/W1516340190,"A neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) was purified in milligram quantities from detergent extracts of embryonic chick brain membranes. N-CAM has an unusual carbohydrate content and structure, is polydisperse in solution, and is associated with proteolytic activity leading to its spontaneous cleavage. The carbohydrate composition of N-CAM includes 13 mol of sialic acid but only 1.4 mol of galactose/100 mol of amino acids, suggesting the presence of a sialic acid to protein linkage not previously observed in higher organisms. N-CAM appears to be an integral membrane protein in that its extraction from membranes required detergent. Although soluble, the purified molecule was aggregated (Mr = 0.5 to 1.2 X 10(6)) and polydisperse in detergent-free solutions. N-CAM from brain also migrated as a broad but continuously stained region from Mr = 200,000 to Mr = 250,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the molecule from retina was similar but had a somewhat faster mobility. Desialation of N-CAM did not significantly change its behavior in solution, but converted both brain and retinal N-CAM to components migrating on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as material of about Mr = 140,000. Despite the apparent heterogeneity, amino acid sequence analysis and comparison of proteolytic fragments suggest that all forms of the glycoprotein are derived from the same polypeptide chain. On prolonged incubation at neutral pH, N-CAM undergoes apparent proteolysis to yield a polypeptide that contains little sialic acid and has a Mr = 65,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a separate sialic acid-rich component, and a variety of small peptides. The 65,000-dalton polypeptide appeared to contain all of the antigenic determinants of intact N-CAM that neutralize the adhesion-blocking ability of anti-retinal cell Fab' fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1499122356,"The denatured and renatured states of bacteriorhodopsin have been studied in detergents and lipid/detergent mixtures by using ultraviolet and visible light absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. Upon solubilization in sodium dodecyl sulfate, bacteriorhodopsin undergoes denaturation with partial loss of the secondary structure and loss of retinal binding ability. In contrast, delipidated bacteriorhodopsin retains its native structure in deoxycholate and undergoes denaturation only on photobleaching, which results in a partial loss of the secondary structure. Native secondary structure spontaneously reforms upon addition of phospholipid/cholate mixtures to bacterio-opsin denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Upon subsequent addition of retinal, up to 95% of the native chromophore (lambdamax = 550-560 nm) is restored. Renaturation also restores the characteristics of light and dark adaptation and tight retinal binding (Kb greater than 10(7) M-1). Renaturation of delipidated bacteriorhodopsin denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate also occurs without phospholipid upon the addition of retinal and Triton X-100 or octyl glucoside. The equilibrium between monomeric and oligomeric states of bacteriorhodopsin has been studied by circular dichroism and fluorescence quenching. Bacteriorhodopsin renatured with Triton X-100 or phospholipid/cholate is monomeric. However, removal of the detergents from renatured protein under specific conditions results in formation of an oligomer in which quaternary interactions are regenerated. The application of fluorescence quenching to the determination of oligomeric size in intrinsic membrane proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1502327274,"The toxicity of abrin, modeccin, and ricin to Vero cells was maximal at neutral and slightly alkaline pH, and it was strongly reduced at pH 6.0 and below. Diphtheria toxin was most toxic at low pH. Binding and endocytosis of abrin, modeccin, and ricin did not vary much within the pH range tested. High concentrations of the carboxylic ionophore Br-X-537A, protected against all four toxins. Combined treatment of cells with an inhibitor of glycolysis and an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation strongly inhibited endocytosis of toxins and protected against intoxication. The protective effect of Ca2+ deprivation, of pH 6.0, and of metabolic inhibitors disappeared soon after transfer of the cells to normal medium, whereas the protective effect of Br-X-537A and of trifluoperazine disappeared slowly. The decay rate of the protection by NH4Cl and by the ionophore A23187 differed with the different toxins. Cells exposed to abrin, modeccin, and ricin under protective conditions which did not inhibit endocytosis of the toxins (Ca2+ deprivation, pH 6.0, Br-X-537A), and then treated with antitoxins to inactivate extracellular toxin, were intoxicated when the protection was released. In contrast, cells exposed to toxins while endocytosis was arrested by treatment with metabolic inhibitors were not intoxicated when antitoxins were added and the metabolic inhibitors removed. Modeccin and diphtheria toxin endocytosed in the presence of trifluoperazine and NH4Cl were unable to intoxicate cells. The possibility that endocytosis is a step in the normal entry route of the toxins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1532585732,"The lipid composition of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (subtype adw) obtained from different carriers has been determined and proven to be truly characteristic of HBsAg and not subject to individual variation. Phosphatidylcholine (approximately 60%), cholesteryl ester (approximately 14%), cholesterol (approximately 15%), and triglycerides (approximately 3%) are the main HBsAg lipid constituents. The fatty acid composition of the different HBsAg lipid components is similar to that of other normal human serum lipoprotein. A photoactivatable hydrophobic probe, pyrenesulfonyl azide, has been used to determine what portions of the protein components of HBsAg are exposed to the HBsAg lipid matrix. Both major HBsAg protein components became randomly pyrenesulfonyl azide labeled in both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal tryptic fragments, therefore suggesting they are buried within the HBsAg lipids. A model for the arrangement of proteins in HBsAg is proposed whereby regions within the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal parts of the two major HBsAg protein components are buried within the lipid matrix of HBsAg particles, while the antigenically important residue 122-150 region is exposed to the aqueous environment."
https://openalex.org/W1518678456,"A lectin (LFA) which is highly specific for sialic acid has been purified from the slug Limax flavus by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation and affinity chromatography on bovine submaxillary mucin coupled to Sepharose 4B. The affinity-purified lectin appeared homogeneous by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Below 1 mg/ml at pH 7, LFA exists as a species of Mr = 44,000 which is composed of two equal sized subunits. Above 1 mg/ml, the protein solution was observed to behave as a rapidly associating-dissociating system. N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycolylneuraminic acid gave a 50% inhibition of agglutination of erythrocytes by LFA at 0.13 and 0.81 mM, respectively. Galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactosamine, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, mannose, arabinose, xylose, fucose, glucuronic acid, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside, alpha-methyl-D-mannoside, lactose, and sucrose were ineffective inhibitors at concentrations up to 10-25 mM. Bovine submaxillary mucin, a sialoprotein, was a potent inhibitor of hemagglutination by LFA. Upon treatment of the mucin with neuraminidase, loss of inhibitory activity was observed which was proportional to the loss of sialic acid from the mucin."

https://openalex.org/W1547045190,"The effect of histone acetylation on chromatin solubility has been studied. Nucleosome cores are fairly soluble over a range of Mg2+ and Na+ concentrations. Increasing the amount of Na+ relative to a fixed concentration of Mg2+ leads to increased solubility. Although the effect is not large, acetylated cores are more soluble than control cores, all other factors being equal. Acetylated oligonucleosomes are vastly more soluble than control oligonucleosomes with the greatest differential seen in the presence of Mg2+ at low ionic strengths. Solubility of acetylated oligonucleosomes is favored when the majority of the histones in the nucleosomes are all highly acetylated. Contiguous highly acetylated nucleosomes are enriched in the rapid kinetic form of histone acetylation after short term exposure to butyrate. These observations have been exploited in a fractionation scheme for chromatin based on the levels of hyperacetylation attained after varied times of exposure to sodium butyrate. Essentially all DNA sequences in an unsynchronized cell population are associated with rapidly acetylated histones. Since it is highly unlikely that each cell has its own discrete set of sequences bound to acetylated histone and since the amount of rapidly acetylated histone in a single cell is relatively small (approximately 10% of total histone), we surmise that rapid acetylation migrates throughout much of the chromatin, perhaps in a sequential and highly organized manner. We postulate that the biological role of histone acetylation is to provide a means for sequentially exposing the entire chromatin for surveillance for DNA damage and possibly for recognition of different regions of the DNA by specific (regulatory?) proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2152291580,"We have previously demonstrated that chick-skin type I collagen and the alpha 1(I) chain mediate platelet aggregation. Aggregation was associated with specific binding of these substances by platelet membranes. We now describe the isolation and purification of the receptor from isolated human platelet membrane. The receptor can be solubilized from platelet membranes with 0.5% Triton or 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Using the combination of gel filtration, affinity column chromatography on alpha 1-Sepharose 4B, and preparative slab gel electrophoreses, the receptor protein can be purified to a single band as judged on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its activity sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Its activity was destroyed by incubation with trypsin or Pronase. The apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 65,000 by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bound [14C]glycine-labeled alpha 1(I) is displaced by unlabeled alpha 1 chain. The binding of [14C]glycine-labeled alpha 1(I) by the purified alpha 1(I) receptor can also be inhibited by the receptor isolated from type I fibrillar collage-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The data suggest that the alpha 1(I) binding site is identical with the type I fibrillar collagen binding site."

https://openalex.org/W2161167548,"A protein factor that prevents the reassociation of eukaryotic 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits when the Mg+ concentration is raised from 1 to 5 mM has been purified to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity from postribosomal supernatant of calf liver extracts. The purified ribosomal subunit anti-association factor is a relatively heat-sensitive protein consisting of a single polypeptide chain of apparent Mr = 25,500. Direct assay for ribosomal subunit anti-association activity indicates that the majority (greater than 90% of such an activity in calf liver extracts can be accounted for by the presence of this 25,500-dalton protein factor in the postribosomal supernatant. The ribosomal salt wash protein fractions are virtually devoid of any significant ribosomal subunit anti-association or 80 S ribosome dissociation activity. The purified anti-association factor maintains a pool of ribosomal subunits by binding to 60 S ribosomal subunits and preventing them from reassociating with 40 S ribosomal subunits, rather than by dissociating 80 S monosomes. The factor neither binds to, nor seems to interact directly with, 40 S subunits. The properties of this factor are thus similar to wheat germ ribosome dissociation factor (eukaryotic initiation factor 6) described by Russell and Spremulli ((1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 8796-8800."
https://openalex.org/W1576040672,"Heparin of an average molecular weight of 13,000 with known polydispersity was degraded using microbial heparinase. The kinetics of this degradation were followed by four assays which measured the anticoagulant activity of the heparin digestion products. Both clotting and amidolytic chromogenic assays were used to measure heparin-potentiated inhibition of both thrombin and Factor Xa. These assays showed different profiles throughout the digestion and were related to the average molecular weight of the digestion products.l The final products of this enzymatic digestion were fractionated on the basis of size and their anticoagulant activities were measured. Fragments causing Factor Xa inhibition but not thrombin inhibition were isolated. Anticoagulant activity was found in a fragment as small as a tetrasaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1597150712,"Rotation of cytochrome P-450 was examined in both liver microsomes and reconstituted and phospholipid vesicles. Purified cytochrome P-450 was incorporated into lipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine-phosphatidylethanolamine-Phosphatidylserne. Rotational diffusion was measured by detecting the decay of absorption anisotropy, r(t), after photolysis of the heme. CO complex by a vertically polarized laser flash. No contribution of vesicle tumbling to r(t) was observed over the experimental time range of 0-500 mus for samples in 60% sucrose. Analysis of r(t) was based on a rotation-about-membrane normal model. The measurements were used to investigate intermolecular interactions of cytochrome P-450. In vesicles of a high lipid to protein ratio (=30 by weight), the residual time-independent normalized anisotropy, r (infinity)/r (0), reached a limiting low value, implying that all cytochrome P-450 was rotating. The mean rotational relaxation time, phi 1, was about 95 mus. In contrast, about 35% of cytochrome P-450 was immobilized in vesicles of a low lipid to protein ratio (=1), with phi 1 of about 95 mus for the mobile fraction. The immobile fraction is presumably due to self-aggregation of cytochrome P-450. In rat liver microsomes, 0-50% of cytochrome P-450 was mobile with phi 1 of about 120 mus at 20 degrees C, and the rest was immobile. A significant temperature dependence of r(t) was observed in microsomes. All cytochrome P-450 was immobile below 7 degrees C, and about 50% of the enzyme was mobile at 37 degrees C with phi 1 approximately 60 mus. From the limiting value of r(infinity)/r(0) congruent to 0.12, the tilt angle of the heme plane of cytochrome p-450 from the membrane plane was calculated to be about 40 degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1563394180,"Transferrin, the serum iron transport protein, provides an excellent model for studying biological metal ion exchange reactions. A curious problem is that while a mixed ligand species of chelate-Fe3+-protein is anticipated from theoretical considerations and supported by kinetic results, no clear spectrophotometric evidence for such an intermediate has heretofore been obtained. In this study of the exchange of Fe3+ between acetohydroxamic acid and transferrin such evidence has been found. The reaction of Fe2+-acetohydroxamic acid with apotransferrin-CO3(2-) is distinctly biphasic when examined by stopped flow spectrophotometry. The first phase is complete within approximately 4 s and results in the formation of a transient species with a distinct spectral maximum at 432 nm. The second phase requires approximately 2 min and results in the formation of Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-). We suggest that the transient species is a mixed ligand complex. The reaction rate-concentration relationship for the formation of the intermediate is linear for Fe3+-acetohydroxamic acid and hyperbolic for apotransferrin-CO3(2-). This suggests a rate-limiting labilization of Fe3+-(acetohydroxamic acid)3 preceding attack by the apotransferrin-CO3(2-). The reverse reaction, the removal of Fe3+ from the Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-) by acetohydroxamic acid, does not provide spectral evidence for the intermediate. The velocity-concentration relationship shows a hyperbolic dependence on acetohydroxamic acid concentration and a linear dependence of Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-), suggesting a rate-limiting labilization of the Fe3+ of Fe3+-transferrin-CO3(2-) resulting from a conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1604208411,"The energetics of active transport of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by neuronal synapses has been studied using preparations of synaptosomes from rat brain. The maximal (steady state) accumulation of GABA by synaptosomes was measured as a function of the transmembrane potassium concentration gradient (which is equal to the transmembrane electrical potential in this system), the sodium concentration gradient, and the external chloride concentration. The steady state [GABA]i/[GABA]o increased as the second power of [K+]i/[K+]o which indicates that GABA is transported with a net charge of +2. The GABA gradient was dependent on [Na+]o/[Na+]i to a power of between 1.2 and 2.1 but was almost independent of [Cl-]. It is concluded that a neutral GABA molecule is cotransported with 2 Na+ to give a net charge of +2. The coupling of GABA transport to the transmembrane electrical potential and the Na+ concentration gradient is sufficient to provide the energy for the measured GABA concentration gradient in rat brain synaptosomes."
https://openalex.org/W174822805,"Soluble extracts of Xenopus laevis blastula stage embryos, oocytes, and adult liver contain lectin activities detected by agglutination of trypsinized, glutaraldehyde-fixed rabbit erythrocytes. Lectin from the embryos and oocytes was purified by affinity chromatography on a column derivatized with melibiose. Trace contaminants were removed either by preparative isoelectric focusing or by gel filtration. Based on its behavior on Sepharose 6B the purified oocyte lectin has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 480,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions there were two major bands with molecular weight ranges of about 43,000 and 45,000, with diffuse trails. Since the purified lectin contains about 20% saccharides by weight and since both bands are glycosylated, diffuseness might be due to variable glycosylation. Heterogeneity was indicated by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels, which showed four protein bands with isoelectric points ranging from 4.4 to 4.9. Lectins from both embryos and oocytes comprised about 1 to 2% of the total soluble protein and could not be distinguished by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the specific hemagglutination activity of the purified oocyte lectin was, on the average, 7-fold higher. Levels in crude extracts of liver were 3 orders of magnitude lower than those from oocytes. The hemagglutination activities of the lectins from embryos, oocytes, and adult liver required Ca2+ and were blocked by similar concentrations of both alpha- and beta-galactosides."
https://openalex.org/W1616594328,"A novel fucoganglioside has been found to be accumulated in the liver of rats fed N-2-acetylaminofluorene before development of hepatoma. This new fucoganglioside persisted in hepatoma in vivo but was completely absent in normal rat liver as well as in livers of rats fed the nonhepatic carcinogen, acetylaminophenanthrene, and a tumor promoter, trichloro-2,2-bis-(chlorophenyl)ethane. The ganglioside was isolated by high performance liquid chromatography and the structure was determined by methylation analysis, sequential degradation by various exoglycosidases, and by direct probe mass spectrometry of the permethylated derivative. This ganglioside, present in precancerous liver and in hepatoma in vivo, was identified as having a new structure with a substitution identical with blood group B determinant as shown below: (formula, see text) A second fucoganglioside was detected in lower quantity in precancerous liver and in hepatoma in vivo but not in control tissue. This ganglioside co-migrated with the fucoganglioside isolated from H-35 hepatoma cells in vitro whose structure was identified (Baumann, H., Nudelman, E., Watanabe, K., and Hakomori, S. (1979) Cancer Res. 39, 2637-2643) as fucosylated GM1 ganglioside (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4 [NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3]Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer). The results indicate that synthesis of new fucolipids is already induced at an early stage during the process of chemical carcinogenesis in rat liver which could be a unique membrane marker for diagnosis and therapy of a hepatoma and its premalignancy."

https://openalex.org/W1567745743,"Four monoclonal antibodies obtained from the fusion of mouse myeloma cells with lymphocytes of mice immunized with bovine rod outer segment disc membranes were shown to bind to the surface of sealed discs. Radioimmune labeling of rod outer segment membrane proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis indicated that two monoclonal antibodies (3D6 and 4B4) were against rhodopsin. Limited proteolysis of rod outer segment membranes with trypsin and Streptomyces griseus protease indicated that the 3D6 antibody bound to the trypsin-sensitive region close to the carboxyl-terminal end of rhodopsin. The 4B4 antibody bound at a trypsin insensitive, but S. griseus protease-sensitive internal region of rhodopsin accessible on the cytoplasmic surface of discs. Two other monoclonal antibodies (3D12 and 4B2) were found to bind to different regions of the Mr = 220,000 concanavalin A binding glycoprotein of rod outer segment disc membranes. Proteolysis studies indicated that these antibodies also bound to a Mr = 140,000 fragment which does not contain the concanavalin A binding site. Immunoferritin-labeling studies for transmission electron microscopy confirm the location of the 3D6 and 4B2 antigens on the cytoplasmic or interdisc surface of disc membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1510296317,Functionally intact acetylcholine receptors can be solubilized from electric organ membranes of Torpedo californica and incorporated into liposomes by the cholate dialysis technique. Freezing and thawing of the reconstituted preparation appears to seal a population of initially leaky vesicles and leads to vesicle fusion. Inclusion of supplementary cholesterol at an optimal concentration of 20% (w/w) greatly enhances vesicle fusion during the freeze-thaw cycle. Size analysis by electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations indicates that fusion is accompanied by shifts in size and volume distributions of the vesicle population. Liposomes formed in the absence of acetylcholine receptors are distributed over a substantially smaller size range than liposomes containing receptors. Acetylcholine receptors appear in those liposomes as dimers of 80 A doughnut-shaped particles. Freeze-fracture replicas of reconstituted preparations reveal the presence of large vesicles containing particles which correspond in size to acetylcholine receptors and smaller liposomes devoid of particles. The distribution of particles in the reconstituted membranes is sparse compared to their dense packing in native electric organ membranes. The activation and desensitization of reconstituted acetylcholine receptors mediated by acetylcholine or carbamylcholine is dose dependent. The reconstituted receptors distinguish between these agonists in terms of binding affinity in a way similar to receptors in the native membrane. Correlation of the fractional occupancy of ligand binding sites by cobratoxin with inhibition of receptor function is used to demonstrate that in the reconstituted system the doubly liganded acetylcholine receptor prevails in controlling channel gating. The potential experimental advantages as well as limitations of this reconstituted system are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1547361416,"A fraction has been prepared from extracts of a human lymphoblastoid cell line that has properties of a mammalian DNA primase and also contains a DNA polymerase activity with unusual properties. With a variety of synthetic single-stranded DNA templates using rNTPs alone, the products consist of oligoribonucleotides of a restricted size range, primarily 7 to 9 nucleotides in length. Poly(dIT) is the most active template found thus far. The activity appears to have relaxed substrate/template complementarity requirements similar to those described previously for mammalian primase; poly(dIT) template with rATP alone results in synthesis of oligo(rA) of the same size as oligo(rAC) made when both rATP and rCTP are present. When dNTPs are added to the reaction, DNA is synthesized by extension of the oligoribonucleotide, which acts as primer. The DNA product appears in relatively discrete sizes that differ by approximately 8 nucleotides, with a large proportion of the product around 24 and 32 nucleotides. In addition to the relatively discrete size of its product, the DNA polymerase activity that utilizes the endogenously synthesized oligoribonucleotide primer on poly(dIT) template differs from polymerase alpha in its resistance to aphidicolin and low Km for dNTP."

https://openalex.org/W1520005582,"Abstract Tubulin purified from rat brain was labeled by conjugation with N-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxy[5-125I]iodophenyl)propionate. Mitochondrial fraction prepared by centrifugation on sucrose density gradient was enriched about 4-fold in cytochrome c oxidase as compared to total liver homogenate. Contamination by plasma membranes was estimated to be about 5%. Radioiodinated pure tubulin bound to purified rat liver mitochondria; binding was time- and temperature-dependent: maximum binding was obtained after 45 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. Under conditions of binding, mitochondria retained their normal characteristics for phosphate accumulation. That binding actually occurs on mitochondria was demonstrated by the co-sedimentation of the tubulin binding and cytochrome c oxidase activities on sucrose gradient. Radioiodinated tubulin binding to mitochondria was specific and saturable. Saturation of binding was obtained using tubulin concentration ranging from 0.02 to 200 micrograms/ml. Hill plot and double reciprocal plot of binding data yielded values of 6 X 10(-8) M for an apparent KD and a maximal binding capacity of 1.4 nmol of tubulin/mg of mitochondrial protein. The Hill coefficient was 0.98 indicating that radioiodinated tubulin bound to a single class of noninteracting sites. The interaction between tubulin and mitochondria was reversible. Dissociation of the complex was obtained by dilution and by lowering the temperature. The dissociation of tubulin-mitochondria complexes was insensitive to ionic strength (0.1 to M NaCl). Mild treatment of mitochondria by trypsin (5 min at 37 degrees C) decreased of tubulin binding, suggesting that protein component(s) of membranes are involved in the interaction of tubulin with mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1579146824,"Amino acid hydroxamates are strong competitive inhibitors of leucine aminopeptidase from porcine kidney. The side chain specificity for inhibition correlates well with substrate specificity. L-Leucine hydroxamate (Ki = 14 microM) protects the enzyme from inactivation by EDTA and is presumed to be a bidentate ligand of the zinc at the active site. A substituted beta-mercaptoketone which may bind in a similar way is also a potent inhibitor (Ki = approximately 1 microM). The binding of these inhibitors suggests a mechanism for this enzyme in which a zinc-bound hydroxide ion participates in concerted proton-transfer processes, while the coordination and charge field at the zinc atom remain unchanged."
https://openalex.org/W1651240508,"The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase of the embryonic chick retina which catalyze the process dolichol phosphate + UDP-GlcNAc Mg2+ leads to GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol + (GlcNAc)2-P-P-dolichol were stimulated 7- to 15-fold by dolichol phosphate-mannose added exogenously to the incubation medium or generated in situ. The relative molar distribution as measured by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4 (-400) of the saccharides liberated by mild acid hydrolysis of the GlcNAc-lipids were (per cent GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol/per cent. (Glc-NAc)2-P-P-dolichol) 95:5 and 90:10 for the basal level of activity and after activation by dolichol phosphate-mannose, respectively. When the reactions were examined in the presence of increasing concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc, the Vmax of the process was increased 10-fold in the presence of dolichol phosphate-mannose over that in its absence. The apparent Km for UDP-GlcNAc, however, was increased 2- to 4-fold. Dolichol phosphate-mannose, not a substrate in these reactions, may function as an allosteric activator of the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases by bringing about this effect on the Vmax. Cooperativity was not apparent when the reaction was examined over a wide range in the concentration of UDP-GlcNAc. These observations suggest that dolichol phosphate-mannose may participate not only as a substrate for alpha-mannosylation, but also as a regulator of the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide-lipids involved in glycoprotein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540222357,"Abstract Cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum appears to contain channel-like structures that render the membrane permeable to small univalent ions. Canine heart microsomes fractionated according to buoyant density were examined by Millipore filtration, light scattering, and membrane potential m easurements. Enzymatic analysis and measurement of D-glucose permeation and Na/Ca exchange systems indicated two membrane fractions suitable for the permeability studies, one enriched in surface membranes with a buoyant density of 1.04-1.11 (10-25% sucrose) and one enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum with a buoyant density of 1.13-1.15 (30-34% sucrose). Surface membrane vesicles impermeable to [3H]sucrose were largely impermeable to K+, Na+, and Cl-, while sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles impermeable to [3H]sucrose were readily permeable to K+, Na+, H+, and Cl-. Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were essentially impermeable to Ca2+, Mg2+, choline+, gluconate-, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (Pipes-), and D-glucose. These results suggest that cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum contains structures that facilitate the movement of small univalent ions. A possible function of these putative ion-conducting structures may be to allow rapid ion fluxes to counter electrogenic Ca2+ fluxes across sarcoplasmic reticulum during cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1544300010,"Proteins from Nicotiana tabacum cytoplasmic and chloroplast ribosomes and their subunits have been isolated under a variety of conditions and resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Average absolute mobility maps, constructed from the resultant electropherograms, were used to compare ribosomal proteins from cytoplasmic and chloroplast ribosomes. A novel technique for the estimation of molecular weights from two-dimensional electrophoretic mobilities is described. The cytoplasmic ribosome of N. tabacum possesses 73-80 distinct proteins with pI greater than 5, 26-30 associated with the 40 S subunit, and 47-50 with the 60 S subunit. The 60 S cytoplasmic ribosomal subunit has, in addition, at least three acidic polypeptides (pI less than 5). The chloroplast ribosome has 55-58 unique basic proteins with 22-23 occurring in the 30 S subunit and 33-35 in the 50 S subunit. A few additional acidic polypeptides are associated with the 30 S and 50 S subunits (2-3 and 1, respectively). There is little similarity between the electrophoretic patterns or molecular weight frequency distributions of proteins of analogous cytoplasmic and chloroplast ribosomal subunits of N. tabacum. The electrophoretic patterns and molecular weight frequency distributions of the proteins of N. tabacum chloroplast ribosomal subunits are quite similar to those of the Escherichia coli ribosome and the chloroplast ribosome of the alga Chlamydomonas. N. tabacum cytoplasmic ribosomal protein electrophoretic patterns and molecular weights are very similar to proteins from the Chlamydomonas cytoplasmic ribosome. These data substantiate: 1) the close affiliation between higher plant chloroplast and prokaryotic ribosomes and 2) a general similarity between angiosperm cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins and other classes of eukaryotic cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1637028605,"An S-adenosylmethionine-=dependent tRNA (guanosine-2'-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.34) was purified to the homogeneous state (2,400-fold) from a cell-free extract of an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB27. The enzyme was highly resistant to heat as reported for other enzymes from thermophilic organism. The enzyme is monomeric and its molecular weight was estimated to be about 20,000. The Km values for S-adenosylmethionine and for Escherichia coli tRNAPhe were determined to be 0.47 microM and 10 nM, respectively, while the Ki for a competitive inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine, was 1.67 microM. When yeast tRNAPhe was methylated with the purified Gm-methyltransferase, a stoichiometric amount of methyl group was incorporated into the invariant guanosine at position 18 in the D-loop. Yeast tRNAPhe and E. coli tRNAMet, which were quantitatively methylated with the enzyme, were very similar to the native tRNAs with regard to amino acid acceptor activity and melting temperature, but were more resistant to RNase T1 and RNase A digestions than the corresponding native tRNAs."

The Brij 58-solubilized lectin chromatographed as a single peak upon gel filtration on Sepharose 4B and the molecular weight was determined to be 234,000 in the absence of calcium by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. When calcium or calcium plus ligand was added, the molecular weight of the lectin increased to 612,000. A pronounced (15%) decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of the galactoside lectin was observed upon addition of calcium. Based upon changes in fluorescence, the equilibrium dissociation constant for calcium and binding protein was 1.5 x 10(-3) M. No major changes were detected upon calcium addition by ultraviolet absorption or circular dichroism spectroscopy, nor were there any changes when a ligand such as lactose was added. The number of calcium ions bound, as determined by ultrafiltration, was 3.3 Ca2+/polypeptide chain in the absence of other divalent metals and 1.92 Ca2+/chain in the presence of 100 mM Mg2+. The equilibrium dissociation constant determined in this manner for Ca2+ was 3.5 x 10(-4) M."
https://openalex.org/W1480044923,"Favin, the glucose- and mannose-binding lectin isolated from fava (Vicia faba) beans, consists of two polypeptide chains (alpha, Mr = 5,571; beta, Mr = 20,700). Translation of fava bean mRNA in vitro in a wheat germ-derived system yields a single favin polypeptide chain of Mr = 29,000. This molecule appears to consist of a hydrophobic 29-amino acid residue signal sequence at the NH2 terminus followed by the beta chain sequence; it also includes the alpha chain sequence. These results suggest that the alpha and beta chains arise by post-translational cleavage of a single precursor polypeptide: signal-beta chain-alpha chain. The signal peptide is similar in sequence to those seen in animal and prokaryotic systems, suggesting that translocation mechanisms are highly conserved. Translation of favin mRNA in the presence of dog pancreas microsomal membranes yields at least three polypeptides in addition to the presumed precursor chain. The largest of these molecules is translocated into the lumen of the membrane vesicles and glycosylated but its signal sequence remains intact. The two other species are translocated and glycosylated, but their signal sequences have been removed; they appear to differ from each other in that one begins with the beta chain sequence and the other begins one residue after the NH2-terminal threonine of the beta chain. These three variants could reflect normal features of the processing of the favin precursor but more likely result from aberrant processing of the plant protein by dog pancreas membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1627508921,"Bovine pituitary rough microsomes were used to determine the ratio of newly synthesized lutropin (LH) alpha and beta subunits in different physiological states of animals. Proteins synthesized by microsomal runoff are derived from preinitiated mRNAs and thus, in the present case, should reflect the initial intracellular steady state levels of the subunits. The products were identified by immunoprecipitation using bovine LH subunit specific antisera and analyzed by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Microsomes isolated from castrated animals (steers) synthesized comparable amounts of LH alpha- and LH beta-subunits as determined by quantitation of the immunoprecipitated products. However, microsomes from intact animals (bulls) directed the synthesis of 3-5 times more alpha than LH beta. A comparison of the levels of alpha- and LH beta-subunits synthesized by an equivalent concentration of bull and steer pituitary microsomes indicates that the increased ratio of alpha to LH beta in bull pituitary microsomes is the result of a preferential decrease in the synthesis of the LH beta subunit. The results suggest that the rate of beta subunit synthesis determines the level of intact LH produced."
https://openalex.org/W1556553429,"A soluble alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase from rat liver catalyzes the decarboxylation and hydroxylation of alpha-ketoisocaproate to form beta-hydroxyisovalerate. The source of oxygen (O2 or H2O) enzymatically incorporated into beta-hydroxyisovalerate was investigated using 18O2 and H218O. Greater than 92% of the carboxyl groups of beta-hydroxyisovaleric acid contained 1 18O atom from 18O2 and 15% of the beta-hydroxyl oxygens of beta-hydroxyisovaleric acid contained 18O from 18O2. Since some oxygen of the beta-hydroxyl group is derived from O2 and since others have shown a rapid H2O in equilibrium ROH exchange for similar reactions, we conclude that both of the oxygens of beta-hydroxyisovaleric acid are derived from O2 and that exchange of water oxygen with the beta-hydroxyl group of beta-hydroxyisovaleric acid must occur with an intermediate of the reaction. Thus, the alpha-ketoisocaproate oxygenase would be a dioxygenase. A mechanism consistent with the 18O experiments and other properties of the enzyme is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1573227317,"Nonspecific lipid transfer protein accelerated cholesterol exchange from brush border vesicles according to a biphasic time course, but sonicated vesicles made from brush border phospholipids and glycosphingolipids showed a single phase exchange. Removal of surface protein with papain or opening brush border vesicles with deoxycholate did not abolish the biphasic exchange pattern. In brush border vesicles treated with cholesterol oxidase, 21 +/- 10% of the free cholesterol was oxidized rapidly, and the remaining cholesterol was oxidized at a slower rate. Opening vesicles with sodium deoxycholate or treatment with phospholipase C, which degraded 55% of the phospholipids, did not increase the size of the rapidly oxidizable cholesterol pool. The rapidly exchangeable and the rapidly oxidizable cholesterol pools appear to represent the same fraction. In double-labeled brush border vesicles 27 +/- 9% of the cholesterol is present in a readily accessible pool, which slowly equilibrates with the remaining membrane cholesterol. The fractional turnover rate of cholesterol in the readily accessible pool equals 0.07 +/- 0.04 h-1 and is increased to 3.35 h-2 by 12 micrograms/ml of nonspecific lipid transfer protein. The heterogeneous distribution of cholesterol in the intact brush border vesicles may not reflect an inside-outside distribution or interaction of cholesterol with membrane lipids but rather an association of more than two-thirds of the membrane cholesterol with a membrane protein fraction."

The most purified fraction obtained by repeated sucrose rate-zonal centrifugation contained three large polypeptides of 150,000, 145,000, and 140,000 daltons and three to four smaller polypeptides ranging from 43,000 to 50,000 daltons. A good resolution of these polypeptides was achieved on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide linear gradient gel (5-20%) which was stained by the silver stain method. The three large polypeptides were also observed in the more crude fractions prepared in the presence of three kinds of protease inhibitors. By a peptide mapping analysis, it was revealed that these three polypeptides have a similar primary structure. Treatments of the enzyme with alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, and neuraminidase did not affect the gel pattern. These results indicate that the 10 S DNA polymerase alpha of calf thymus has a microheterogeneity in terms of the large polypeptide component. Among these three large polypeptides, the two polypeptides of 150,000 and 145,000 daltons disappeared by keeping the sucrose gradient fraction at 4 degrees C in the absence of glycerol, while the 140,000-dalton polypeptide was well preserved. The poly(rA)oligo(dT)-dependent activity of 10 S DNA polymerase alpha was selectively lost under this condition."
https://openalex.org/W1496971763,"The almond emulsin fucosidase that specifically hydrolyzes fucose in alpha (1-3) linkage to N-acetylglucosamine has been purified 1250-fold. The purification procedure includes ion exchange chromatography on sulfopropyl-Sephadex C-25, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200, and affinity chromatography on Cibacron blue-Sepharose 4B-CL. The molecular weight of the fucosidase was estimated by gel filtration as approximately 73,000. Enzyme activity was maximal at pH 5.3 in acetate buffer and was dependent on ionic strength; at least 0.1 M NaCl was necessary for optimal activity. The purified enzyme was free of beta-galactosidase activity toward the glycoprotein substrate [3H]galactosyl-asialotransferrin and did not release fucose from substrates containing fucose in alpha (1-6) linkage, (bovine IgG glycopeptides) or in alpha (1-2) linkage, (2'-fucosyllactose). The fucosidase displayed activity toward two glycoprotein substrates known to contain fucose in alpha (1-3) linkage. Extensive incubations resulted in the release of 83% and 43% of the total fucose of asialoorosomucoid and lactoferrin, respectively. The fucosidase did not release fucose from either the slow or the fast form of alpha 2-macroglobulin, suggesting the absence of fucosyl alpha (1-3) linkages on that glycoprotein."

Normal regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity and synthesis in this mutant by 25-hydroxycholesterol can be restored by simultaneous incubation with a small (0.4 mM) mevalonate supplement.

https://openalex.org/W1521196495,"Circular dichroism spectroscopy in the 170-220-nm range of the ultraviolet and measurements of the amide proton coupling constants in nmr have been used to investigate the conformation of asparagine-linked glycopeptides having oligosaccharide chains of the complex antenna type. The CD spectra can be explained as the sum of three contributions, the first of which is a pair of large bands of opposite sign resulting from coupling of the adjacent chromophores of the 2-acetamido-1-N-(4-aspartyl)-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranosylamine linkage. Secondly the amide chromophore of the core N-acetylglucosamine residue substituted at carbon 4 by a beta-mannosyl residue contributes a negative band at 210 nm along with a small negative signal in the 180-190-nm region. The amides of the antenna N-acetylglucosamine residues, which in some cases are substituted by beta-galactosyl residues at carbon 4, contribute a negative band at 210 and a strong positive band at 185-190 nm. Since these three contributions are approximately independent, we can detect no long range interactions between nonreducing termini and the glycopeptide linkage region. Both CD and nmr data imply that the glucosaminyl-asparagine linkage is rigidly fixed in a conformation having the amide protons trans to the sugar ring protons. These results are consistent with an extended conformation in the shape of a Y or a T for complex type asialo-oligosaccharide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1585194990,"The evidence for equivalent catalytic sites in tetrameric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle has been re-examined and found to be insufficient to exclude alternating or reciprocating sites models. Using a column centrifugation technique, lower limits have been set on the rates of binding and release of coenzyme, and on the ratio of the affinities of NAD+ and NADH. The binding to acyl enzyme has also been examined. The tightly bound NAD+ has been found to be reduced preferentially and kinetically competently when glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is added, demonstrating the nonequivalence of the sites in the transient reduction of NAD+. The rate of release of the NADH formed rapidly from tightly bound NAD+ was monitored directly by using lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate to regenerate NAD+. This rate was sufficiently rapid for the NADH formed from tightly bound NAD+ to be a catalytic intermediate. Although these and other results are consistent with a simple alternating sites model, additional approaches appear necessary to find if subunit catalytic cooperativity occurs with this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1533716874,"Surface sialoglycoconjugates of HeLa and HTC cells were labeled with NaB[3H]4 after oxidation of NaIO4. The labeling procedure cleaves the sialic acids to a neuraminidase-sensitive 7-carbon derivative, 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-L-arabino-heptulosonic acid, termed AcNeu7 (Van Lenten, L., and Ashwell, G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1889-1894). After labeling, the radioactivity is lost from both cell types with biphasic kinetics. The half-time for the fast phase is about 4-5 h; the slow phase has a half-time of 100-200 h. About 30 h after labeling and at later times, approximately 30% of the cell-associated radioactivity is susceptible to removal by external neuraminidase, suggesting an exchange with an internal pool that is twice the size of the surface pool. An internal pool of relatively high specific activity compared to the surface was generated by labeling as above, followed by a period of time to allow internalization and enzymatic removal of external neuraminidase-sensitive radioactivity. During subsequent reincubation in growth medium, the surface became relabeled from the internal pool, again reaching a 30% neuraminidase-sensitive plateau. The relabeling of the surface was confirmed by radioactivity measurements on isolated plasma membranes. [3H]AcNeu7 cannot be reutilized by these cells in the de novo membrane biosynthetic pathway. The argument is made that the labeled sialoglycoconjugates are recycling intact through the internal pool."
https://openalex.org/W1550701241,"The reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups of leucine aminopeptidase from bovine eye lens has been studied by carboxymethylation with iodoacetate of the native enzyme (Zn2+-Zn2+), of the enzyme activated with magnesium (Zn+-Mg2+) or manganese (Zn2+-Mn2+), the enzyme incubated with cobalt (CO2+-Co2+), and the metal-free apoenzyme. The reactivity of the sulfhydryl groups was also determined in the presence of denaturing agents with or without reducing agents. All seven half-cystines per leucine aminopeptidase subunit are in the sulfhydryl form. In the native and the Zn2+-Mn2+ enzyme, only one of the cysteines (residue 344) reacts readily with iodoacetate. In the Zn2+-Mg2+ enzyme, two cysteines react (residues 344 and 412) and in the Co2+-incubated enzyme only one (residue 412). The metal-free apoenzyme has at least three reactive cysteines (residues 344, 412, and 429). The data suggest that sulfhydryl groups are involved in the binding of metal ions."
https://openalex.org/W2298557736,"Schiff base formation between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and model compounds of increasing complexity (i.e. L-valine and poly-L-lysine) and between pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and the apoenzyme of aspartate aminotransferase has been analyzed by microcalorimetric methods. The apparent pKa values and protonation enthalpy values for the relevant groups ionizing in the pH 4-9 range have been determined for the Schiff bases of L-valine and of poly-L-lysine. Upon Schiff base formation, the only noticeable change is the lowering of the ring nitrogen pK, accompanied by an increase of the relative delta H. In the poly-L-lysine Schiff base, however, the delta H relative to the protonation of the phosphate dianion becomes more negative. This behavior suggests a multiple interaction between the polymer and the ligand. The intrinsic heat of formation is small (congruent to -1 kcal/mol), of the same order of magnitude for both Schiff bases, and appears to be independent of the nature of the aminic reagent. The heat of reaction of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate with aspartate apoaminotransferase has been determined in the pH 6.2-8.8 range at 19 degrees C and at 25 degrees C. Each isotherm is characterized by a lack of proton evolution, a result that is unexpected on the basis of the known pK values of the reagents, and by a sharp pH dependence of the enthalpy change. Moreover, comparison of the two isotherms allows: (a) detection of a protonation-dependent effect (pK 7.5 at 25 degrees C), (b) exclusion of a preferential binding of the coenzyme to the apoenzyme in a particular ionization state; and (c) suggestion of a tightening of the protein molecule upon holoenzyme formation."

Incubation with 88 mM sucrose for more than 10 days exhibited significant effects. Biochemically, the activities of deficient hydrolases reached their normal levels, and morphologically, typical inclusion materials disappeared. These results indicate that sucrose enhanced synthesis of normal lysosomal enzymes and lysosome functions were normalized in ICD fibroblasts."
