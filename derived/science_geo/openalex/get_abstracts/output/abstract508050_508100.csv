https://openalex.org/W1972476556,"CRISPR-Cas9 is a versatile genome editing technology for studying the functions of genetic elements. To broadly enable the application of Cas9 in vivo, we established a Cre-dependent Cas9 knockin mouse. We demonstrated in vivo as well as ex vivo genome editing using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-, lentivirus-, or particle-mediated delivery of guide RNA in neurons, immune cells, and endothelial cells. Using these mice, we simultaneously modeled the dynamics of KRAS, p53, and LKB1, the top three significantly mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma. Delivery of a single AAV vector in the lung generated loss-of-function mutations in p53 and Lkb1, as well as homology-directed repair-mediated KrasG12D mutations, leading to macroscopic tumors of adenocarcinoma pathology. Together, these results suggest that Cas9 mice empower a wide range of biological and disease modeling applications."
https://openalex.org/W2137217704,"The poor clinical outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is attributed to intrinsic chemoresistance and a growth-permissive tumor microenvironment. Conversion of quiescent to activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) drives the severe stromal reaction that characterizes PDA. Here, we reveal that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in stroma from human pancreatic tumors and that treatment with the VDR ligand calcipotriol markedly reduced markers of inflammation and fibrosis in pancreatitis and human tumor stroma. We show that VDR acts as a master transcriptional regulator of PSCs to reprise the quiescent state, resulting in induced stromal remodeling, increased intratumoral gemcitabine, reduced tumor volume, and a 57% increase in survival compared to chemotherapy alone. This work describes a molecular strategy through which transcriptional reprogramming of tumor stroma enables chemotherapeutic response and suggests vitamin D priming as an adjunct in PDA therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2117415152,"Depression is a debilitating condition with a profound impact on quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Physical exercise is used as a treatment strategy for many patients, but the mechanisms that underlie its beneficial effects remain unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism by which skeletal muscle PGC-1α1 induced by exercise training changes kynurenine metabolism and protects from stress-induced depression. Activation of the PGC-1α1-PPARα/δ pathway increases skeletal muscle expression of kynurenine aminotransferases, thus enhancing the conversion of kynurenine into kynurenic acid, a metabolite unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. Reducing plasma kynurenine protects the brain from stress-induced changes associated with depression and renders skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1α1 transgenic mice resistant to depression induced by chronic mild stress or direct kynurenine administration. This study opens therapeutic avenues for the treatment of depression by targeting the PGC-1α1-PPAR axis in skeletal muscle, without the need to cross the blood-brain barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2069376956,"Elevated plasma levels of branched chain amino acids detected prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis may result from whole body tissue breakdown occurring during the early stages of this disease. Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are diagnosed with advanced disease and survive less than 12 months1. PDAC has been linked with obesity and glucose intolerance2,3,4, but whether changes in circulating metabolites are associated with early cancer progression is unknown. To better understand metabolic derangements associated with early disease, we profiled metabolites in prediagnostic plasma from individuals with pancreatic cancer (cases) and matched controls from four prospective cohort studies. We find that elevated plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are associated with a greater than twofold increased risk of future pancreatic cancer diagnosis. This elevated risk was independent of known predisposing factors, with the strongest association observed among subjects with samples collected 2 to 5 years before diagnosis, when occult disease is probably present. We show that plasma BCAAs are also elevated in mice with early-stage pancreatic cancers driven by mutant Kras expression but not in mice with Kras-driven tumors in other tissues, and that breakdown of tissue protein accounts for the increase in plasma BCAAs that accompanies early-stage disease. Together, these findings suggest that increased whole-body protein breakdown is an early event in development of PDAC."
https://openalex.org/W1995837988,"Cancer primarily develops because of somatic alterations in the genome. Advances in sequencing have enabled large-scale sequencing studies across many tumor types, emphasizing the discovery of alterations in protein-coding genes. However, the protein-coding exome comprises less than 2% of the human genome. Here we analyze the complete genome sequences of 863 human tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources to systematically identify noncoding regions that are recurrently mutated in cancer. We use new frequency- and sequence-based approaches to comprehensively scan the genome for noncoding mutations with potential regulatory impact. These methods identify recurrent mutations in regulatory elements upstream of PLEKHS1, WDR74 and SDHD, as well as previously identified mutations in the TERT promoter. SDHD promoter mutations are frequent in melanoma and are associated with reduced gene expression and poor prognosis. The non-protein-coding cancer genome remains widely unexplored, and our findings represent a step toward targeting the entire genome for clinical purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2053855164,"Intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions are used by many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to achieve their diverse functions. To identify these contacts, we developed a method based on RNA antisense purification to systematically map RNA-RNA interactions (RAP-RNA) and applied it to investigate two ncRNAs implicated in RNA processing: U1 small nuclear RNA, a component of the spliceosome, and Malat1, a large ncRNA that localizes to nuclear speckles. U1 and Malat1 interact with nascent transcripts through distinct targeting mechanisms. Using differential crosslinking, we confirmed that U1 directly hybridizes to 5' splice sites and 5' splice site motifs throughout introns and found that Malat1 interacts with pre-mRNAs indirectly through protein intermediates. Interactions with nascent pre-mRNAs cause U1 and Malat1 to localize proximally to chromatin at active genes, demonstrating that ncRNAs can use RNA-RNA interactions to target specific pre-mRNAs and genomic sites. RAP-RNA is sensitive to lower abundance RNAs as well, making it generally applicable for investigating ncRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2041537722,"A global bioinformatic classification of >11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters from >800 bacterial genomes and cross-correlation with metabolomics data from nearly 200 strains sets the stage for targeted natural product discovery. Actinobacteria encode a wealth of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, whose systematic study is complicated by numerous repetitive motifs. By combining several metrics, we developed a method for the global classification of these gene clusters into families (GCFs) and analyzed the biosynthetic capacity of Actinobacteria in 830 genome sequences, including 344 obtained for this project. The GCF network, comprising 11,422 gene clusters grouped into 4,122 GCFs, was validated in hundreds of strains by correlating confident mass spectrometric detection of known small molecules with the presence or absence of their established biosynthetic gene clusters. The method also linked previously unassigned GCFs to known natural products, an approach that will enable de novo, bioassay-free discovery of new natural products using large data sets. Extrapolation from the 830-genome data set reveals that Actinobacteria encode hundreds of thousands of future drug leads, and the strong correlation between phylogeny and GCFs frames a roadmap to efficiently access them."
https://openalex.org/W1964478423,"An elegant mathematical model supported by experiments in Escherichia coli demonstrates how clustering enzymes can efficiently channel intermediates from one enzyme to the next, facilitating rational engineering of metabolism. We present a quantitative model to demonstrate that coclustering multiple enzymes into compact agglomerates accelerates the processing of intermediates, yielding the same efficiency benefits as direct channeling, a well-known mechanism in which enzymes are funneled between enzyme active sites through a physical tunnel. The model predicts the separation and size of coclusters that maximize metabolic efficiency, and this prediction is in agreement with previously reported spacings between coclusters in mammalian cells. For direct validation, we study a metabolic branch point in Escherichia coli and experimentally confirm the model prediction that enzyme agglomerates can accelerate the processing of a shared intermediate by one branch, and thus regulate steady-state flux division. Our studies establish a quantitative framework to understand coclustering-mediated metabolic channeling and its application to both efficiency improvement and metabolic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2123515098,"Invertebrate model systems are powerful tools for studying human disease owing to their genetic tractability and ease of screening. We conducted a mosaic genetic screen of lethal mutations on the Drosophila X chromosome to identify genes required for the development, function, and maintenance of the nervous system. We identified 165 genes, most of whose function has not been studied in vivo. In parallel, we investigated rare variant alleles in 1,929 human exomes from families with unsolved Mendelian disease. Genes that are essential in flies and have multiple human homologs were found to be likely to be associated with human diseases. Merging the human data sets with the fly genes allowed us to identify disease-associated mutations in six families and to provide insights into microcephaly associated with brain dysgenesis. This bidirectional synergism between fly genetics and human genomics facilitates the functional annotation of evolutionarily conserved genes involved in human health."
https://openalex.org/W1972984145,"Telomere length maintenance is a requisite feature of cellular immortalization and a hallmark of human cancer. While most human cancers express telomerase activity, ∼10%-15% employ a recombination-dependent telomere maintenance pathway known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) that is characterized by multitelomere clusters and associated promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies. Here, we show that a DNA double-strand break (DSB) response at ALT telomeres triggers long-range movement and clustering between chromosome termini, resulting in homology-directed telomere synthesis. Damaged telomeres initiate increased random surveillance of nuclear space before displaying rapid directional movement and association with recipient telomeres over micron-range distances. This phenomenon required Rad51 and the Hop2-Mnd1 heterodimer, which are essential for homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis. These findings implicate a specialized homology searching mechanism in ALT-dependent telomere maintenance and provide a molecular basis underlying the preference for recombination between nonsister telomeres during ALT."
https://openalex.org/W2070125981,"The neural origins of spontaneous or self-initiated actions are not well understood and their interpretation is controversial. To address these issues, we used a task in which rats decide when to abort waiting for a delayed tone. We recorded neurons in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and interpreted our findings in light of an integration-to-bound decision model. A first population of M2 neurons ramped to a constant threshold at rates proportional to waiting time, strongly resembling integrator output. A second population, which we propose provide input to the integrator, fired in sequences and showed trial-to-trial rate fluctuations correlated with waiting times. An integration model fit to these data also quantitatively predicted the observed inter-neuronal correlations. Together, these results reinforce the generality of the integration-to-bound model of decision-making. These models identify the initial intention to act as the moment of threshold crossing while explaining how antecedent subthreshold neural activity can influence an action without implying a decision."
https://openalex.org/W2029057113,"Behavioral choices that ignore prior experience promote exploration and unpredictability but are seemingly at odds with the brain's tendency to use experience to optimize behavioral choice. Indeed, when faced with virtual competitors, primates resort to strategic counter prediction rather than to stochastic choice. Here, we show that rats also use history- and model-based strategies when faced with similar competitors but can switch to a ""stochastic"" mode when challenged with a competitor that they cannot defeat by counter prediction. In this mode, outcomes associated with an animal's actions are ignored, and normal engagement of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is suppressed. Using circuit perturbations in transgenic rats, we demonstrate that switching between strategic and stochastic behavioral modes is controlled by locus coeruleus input into ACC. Our findings suggest that, under conditions of uncertainty about environmental rules, changes in noradrenergic input alter ACC output and prevent erroneous beliefs from guiding decisions, thus enabling behavioral variation.

https://openalex.org/W2047612586,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates diverse environmental signals to control cellular growth and organismal homeostasis. In response to nutrients, Rag GTPases recruit mTORC1 to the lysosome to be activated, but how Rags are regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that Sestrins bind to the heterodimeric RagA/B-RagC/D GTPases, and function as guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) for RagA/B. Sestrin overexpression inhibits amino-acid-induced Rag guanine nucleotide exchange and mTORC1 translocation to the lysosome. Mutation of the conserved GDI motif creates a dominant-negative form of Sestrin that renders mTORC1 activation insensitive to amino acid deprivation, whereas a cell-permeable peptide containing the GDI motif inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Mice deficient in all Sestrins exhibit reduced postnatal survival associated with defective mTORC1 inactivation in multiple organs during neonatal fasting. These findings reveal a nonredundant mechanism by which the Sestrin family of GDIs regulates the nutrient-sensing Rag GTPases to control mTORC1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1966113514,"Progranulin overexpression in Alzheimer's disease model mice protects against neuronal loss and enhances cognitive deficits. Haploinsufficiency of the progranulin (PGRN) gene (GRN) causes familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and modulates an innate immune response in humans and in mouse models. GRN polymorphism may be linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of PGRN in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that PGRN inhibits amyloid β (Aβ) deposition. Selectively reducing microglial expression of PGRN in AD mouse models impaired phagocytosis, increased plaque load threefold and exacerbated cognitive deficits. Lentivirus-mediated PGRN overexpression lowered plaque load in AD mice with aggressive amyloid plaque pathology. Aβ plaque load correlated negatively with levels of hippocampal PGRN, showing the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of PGRN on plaque deposition. PGRN also protected against Aβ toxicity. Lentivirus-mediated PGRN overexpression prevented spatial memory deficits and hippocampal neuronal loss in AD mice. The protective effects of PGRN against Aβ deposition and toxicity have important therapeutic implications. We propose enhancing PGRN as a potential treatment for PGRN-deficient FTLD and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2026297218,"Drinking water is innately rewarding to thirsty animals. In addition, the consumed value can be assigned to behavioral actions and predictive sensory cues by associative learning. Here we show that thirst converts water avoidance into water-seeking in naive Drosophila melanogaster. Thirst also permitted flies to learn olfactory cues paired with water reward. Water learning required water taste and <40 water-responsive dopaminergic neurons that innervate a restricted zone of the mushroom body γ lobe. These water learning neurons are different from those that are critical for conveying the reinforcing effects of sugar. Naive water-seeking behavior in thirsty flies did not require water taste but relied on another subset of water-responsive dopaminergic neurons that target the mushroom body β' lobe. Furthermore, these naive water-approach neurons were not required for learned water-seeking. Our results therefore demonstrate that naive water-seeking, learned water-seeking and water learning use separable neural circuitry in the brain of thirsty flies."
https://openalex.org/W2153583705,"The HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) is densely covered with self-glycans that should help shield it from recognition by the human immune system. Here, we examine how a particularly potent family of broadly neutralizing antibodies (Abs) has evolved common and distinct structural features to counter the glycan shield and interact with both glycan and protein components of HIV Env. The inferred germline antibody already harbors potential binding pockets for a glycan and a short protein segment. Affinity maturation then leads to divergent evolutionary branches that either focus on a single glycan and protein segment (e.g., Ab PGT124) or engage multiple glycans (e.g., Abs PGT121-123). Furthermore, other surrounding glycans are avoided by selecting an appropriate initial antibody shape that prevents steric hindrance. Such molecular recognition lessons are important for engineering proteins that can recognize or accommodate glycans."
https://openalex.org/W2080940456,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) recently emerged as a pro-metastatic factor highly associated with poor prognosis in a number of cancers. This correlation seemed paradox as TIMP-1 is best described as an inhibitor of pro-tumourigenic matrix metalloproteinases. Only recently, TIMP-1 has been revealed as a signalling molecule that can regulate cancer progression independent of its inhibitory properties. In the present study, we demonstrate that an increase of both exogenous and endogenous TIMP-1 led to the upregulation of miR-210 in a CD63/PI3K/AKT/HIF-1-dependent pathway in lung adenocarcinoma cells. TIMP-1 induced P110/P85 PI3K-signalling and AKT phosphorylation. It also led to increase of HIF-1α protein levels positively correlating with HIF-1-regulated mRNA expression and upregulation of the microRNA miR-210. Downstream targets of miR-210, namely FGFRL1, E2F3, VMP-1, RAD52 and SDHD, were decreased in the presence of TIMP-1. Upon the overexpression of TIMP-1 in tumour cells, miR-210 was accumulated in exosomes in vitro and in vivo. These exosomes promoted tube formation activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs), which was reflected in increased angiogenesis in A549L-derived tumour xenografts. Activation and elevation of PI3K, AKT, HIF-1A and miR-210 in tumours additionally confirmed our in vitro data. This new pro-tumourigenic signalling function of TIMP-1 may explain why elevated TIMP-1 levels in lung cancer patients are highly correlated with poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019571068,"Oligodendrocytes in the mammalian brain are continuously generated from NG2 cells throughout postnatal life. However, it is unclear when the decision is made for NG2 cells to self-renew or differentiate into oligodendrocytes after cell division. Using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo imaging and fate analysis of proliferated NG2 cells in fixed tissue, we demonstrate that in the postnatal developing mouse brain, the majority of divided NG2 cells differentiate into oligodendrocytes during a critical age-specific temporal window of 3-8 d. Notably, within this time period, damage to myelin and oligodendrocytes accelerated oligodendrocyte differentiation from divided cells, and whisker removal decreased the survival of divided cells in the deprived somatosensory cortex. These findings indicate that during the critical temporal window of plasticity, the fate of divided NG2 cells is sensitive to modulation by external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2170746309,"The emergence of recombination-activating genes (RAGs) in jawed vertebrates endowed adaptive immune cells with the ability to assemble a diverse set of antigen receptor genes. In contrast, innate lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells, are not believed to require RAGs. Here, we report that NK cells unable to express RAGs or RAG endonuclease activity during ontogeny exhibit a cell-intrinsic hyperresponsiveness but a diminished capacity to survive following virus-driven proliferation, a reduced expression of DNA damage response mediators, and defects in the repair of DNA breaks. Evidence for this novel function of RAG has also been observed in T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), revealing an unexpected role for RAG proteins beyond V(D)J recombination. We propose that DNA cleavage events mediated by RAG endow developing adaptive and innate lymphocytes with a cellular ""fitness"" that safeguards their persistence later in life during episodes of rapid proliferation or cellular stress."
https://openalex.org/W2091618419,"Exosomes, also known as microvesicles (EMVs), are nano-sized membranous particles secreted from nearly all mammalian cell types. These nanoparticles play critical roles in many physiological processes including cell-cell signaling, immune activation, and suppression and are associated with disease states such as tumor progression. The biological functions of EMVs are highly dependent on their protein composition, which can dictate pathogenicity. Although some mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of EMV protein trafficking, little attention has been paid to N-linked glycosylation as a potential sorting signal. Previous work from our laboratory found a conserved glycan signature for EMVs, which differed from that of the parent cell membranes, suggesting a potential role for glycosylation in EMV biogenesis. In this study, we further explore the role of glycosylation in EMV protein trafficking. We identify EMV glycoproteins and demonstrate alteration of their recruitment as a function of their glycosylation status upon pharmacological manipulation. Furthermore, we show that genetic manipulation of the glycosylation levels of a specific EMV glycoprotein, EWI-2, directly impacts its recruitment as a function of N-linked glycan sites. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that N-linked glycosylation directs glycoprotein sorting into EMVs."
https://openalex.org/W2037216703,"Melatonin, the “hormone of darkness,” is a key regulator of vertebrate circadian physiology and behavior. Despite its ubiquitous presence in Metazoa, the function of melatonin signaling outside vertebrates is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of melatonin signaling on circadian swimming behavior in a zooplankton model, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We find that melatonin is produced in brain photoreceptors with a vertebrate-type opsin-based phototransduction cascade and a light-entrained clock. Melatonin released at night induces rhythmic burst firing of cholinergic neurons that innervate locomotor-ciliated cells. This establishes a nocturnal behavioral state by modulating the length and the frequency of ciliary arrests. Based on our findings, we propose that melatonin signaling plays a role in the circadian control of ciliary swimming to adjust the vertical position of zooplankton in response to ambient light."
https://openalex.org/W2152005166,"Complex gene regulatory networks require transcription factors (TFs) to bind distinct DNA sequences. To understand how novel TF specificity evolves, we combined phylogenetic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches to interrogate how DNA recognition diversified in the steroid hormone receptor (SR) family. After duplication of the ancestral SR, three mutations in one copy radically weakened binding to the ancestral estrogen response element (ERE) and improved binding to a new set of DNA sequences (steroid response elements, SREs). They did so by establishing unfavorable interactions with ERE and abolishing unfavorable interactions with SRE; also required were numerous permissive substitutions, which nonspecifically improved cooperativity and affinity of DNA binding. Our findings indicate that negative determinants of binding play key roles in TFs' DNA selectivity and-with our prior work on the evolution of SR ligand specificity during the same interval-show how a specific new gene regulatory module evolved without interfering with the integrity of the ancestral module."
https://openalex.org/W1988589221,"Plant polyphenols exert anti-inflammatory activity through both anti-oxidant effects and modulation of pivotal pro-inflammatory genes. Recently, Citrus bergamia has been studied as a natural source of bioactive molecules with antioxidant activity, but few studies have focused on molecular mechanisms underlying their potential beneficial effects. Several findings have suggested that polyphenols could influence cellular function by acting as activators of SIRT1, a nuclear histone deacetylase, involved in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling. On the basis of these observations we studied the anti-inflammatory effects produced by the flavonoid fraction of the bergamot juice (BJe) in a model of LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell line, focusing on SIRT1-mediated NF-κB inhibition. We demonstrated that BJe inhibited both gene expression and secretion of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) by a mechanism involving the inhibition of NF-κB activation. In addition, we showed that BJe treatment reversed the LPS-enhanced acetylation of p65 in THP-1 cells. Interestingly, increasing concentrations of Sirtinol were able to suppress the inhibitory effect of BJe via p65 acetylation, underscoring that NF-κB–mediated inflammatory cytokine production may be directly linked to SIRT1 activity. These results suggest that BJe may be useful for the development of alternative pharmacological strategies aimed at reducing the inflammatory process."
https://openalex.org/W2021582794,"The protective role of etanercept in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion is not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether etanercept modulates neutrophil accumulation, TNF-α induction and oxidative stress in an ischemia/reperfusion injured rat heart model. Rats were randomly exposed to sham operation, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) alone, MI/R+ etanercept. The results demonstrated that compared to MI/R, etanercept reduced myocardial infarction area, myocardial myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, serum creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and both serum and myocardial TNF-α production. Etanercept also markedly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in MI/R rats. In summary, our data suggested that etanercept has protective effects against MI/R injury in rats, which may be attributed to attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2065397738,"Denmark has an extraordinarily large and well-preserved collection of archaeological skin garments found in peat bogs, dated to approximately 920 BC – AD 775. These objects provide not only the possibility to study prehistoric skin costume and technologies, but also to investigate the animal species used for the production of skin garments. Until recently, species identification of archaeological skin was primarily performed by light and scanning electron microscopy or the analysis of ancient DNA. However, the efficacy of these methods can be limited due to the harsh, mostly acidic environment of peat bogs leading to morphological and molecular degradation within the samples. We compared species assignment results of twelve archaeological skin samples from Danish bogs using Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based peptide sequencing, against results obtained using light and scanning electron microscopy. While it was difficult to obtain reliable results using microscopy, MS enabled the identification of several species-diagnostic peptides, mostly from collagen and keratins, allowing confident species discrimination even among taxonomically close organisms, such as sheep and goat. Unlike previous MS-based methods, mostly relying on peptide fingerprinting, the shotgun sequencing approach we describe aims to identify the complete extracted ancient proteome, without preselected specific targets. As an example, we report the identification, in one of the samples, of two peptides uniquely assigned to bovine foetal haemoglobin, indicating the production of skin from a calf slaughtered within the first months of its life. We conclude that MS-based peptide sequencing is a reliable method for species identification of samples from bogs. The mass spectrometry proteomics data were deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD001029."
https://openalex.org/W2069139751,"The temperature of an object provides important somatosensory information for animals performing tactile tasks. Humans can perceive skin cooling of less than one degree, but the sensory afferents and central circuits that they engage to enable the perception of surface temperature are poorly understood. To address these questions, we examined the perception of glabrous skin cooling in mice. We found that mice were also capable of perceiving small amplitude skin cooling and that primary somatosensory (S1) cortical neurons were required for cooling perception. Moreover, the absence of the menthol-gated transient receptor potential melastatin 8 ion channel in sensory afferent fibers eliminated the ability to perceive cold and the corresponding activation of S1 neurons. Our results identify parts of a neural circuit underlying cold perception in mice and provide a new model system for the analysis of thermal processing and perception and multimodal integration."
https://openalex.org/W2126988283,"The G protein-coupled ghrelin receptor GHSR1a is a potential pharmacological target for treating obesity and addiction because of the critical role ghrelin plays in energy homeostasis and dopamine-dependent reward. GHSR1a enhances growth hormone release, appetite, and dopamine signaling through G(q/11), G(i/o), and G(12/13) as well as β-arrestin-based scaffolds. However, the contribution of individual G protein and β-arrestin pathways to the diverse physiological responses mediated by ghrelin remains unknown. To characterize whether a signaling bias occurs for GHSR1a, we investigated ghrelin signaling in a number of cell-based assays, including Ca(2+) mobilization, serum response factor response element, stress fiber formation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and β-arrestin translocation, utilizing intracellular second loop and C-tail mutants of GHSR1a. We observed that GHSR1a and β-arrestin rapidly form metastable plasma membrane complexes following exposure to an agonist, but replacement of the GHSR1a C-tail by the tail of the vasopressin 2 receptor greatly stabilizes them, producing complexes observable on the plasma membrane and also in endocytic vesicles. Mutations of the contiguous conserved amino acids Pro-148 and Leu-149 in the GHSR1a intracellular second loop generate receptors with a strong bias to G protein and β-arrestin, respectively, supporting a role for conformation-dependent signaling bias in the wild-type receptor. Our results demonstrate more balance in GHSR1a-mediated ERK signaling from G proteins and β-arrestin but uncover an important role for β-arrestin in RhoA activation and stress fiber formation. These findings suggest an avenue for modulating drug abuse-associated changes in synaptic plasticity via GHSR1a and indicate the development of GHSR1a-biased ligands as a promising strategy for selectively targeting downstream signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W1975201792,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 35 (TRIM35) is a member of RBCC family, which has a highly conserved order consisting of a RING domain followed by one or two B-Box domains and then a coiled-coil domain. We previously identified TRIM35 as a novel tumor suppressor in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular mechanism that TRIM35 uses to suppress tumorigenicity is largely unknown. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) has been demonstrated to have a central role in metabolic reprogramming during cancer progression. Phosphorylation of PKM2 tyrosine residue 105 (Y105) regulates PKM2 to provide a metabolic advantage to tumor cells, thereby promoting tumor growth. In the present work, mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated an interaction between TRIM35 and PKM2. Co-IP experiments confirmed that TRIM35 interacts with PKM2 and that the coiled-coil domain is required for such an interaction. Furthermore, the coiled-coil domain mediates decreases in the Warburg effect and in the cell proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, TRIM35 suppresses the tumorigenicity of HCC cells through the blockade of PKM2 Y105 phosphorylation. Collectively, our data reveal a new function for TRIM35, which is to regulate the Warburg effect and tumorigenicity through interaction with PKM2 in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2161279049,"Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are sap-sucking insect pests, and some cause serious damage in agricultural crops by direct feeding and by transmitting plant viruses. Whiteflies maintain close associations with bacterial endosymbionts that can significantly influence their biology. All whitefly species harbor a primary endosymbiont, and a diverse array of secondary endosymbionts. In this study, we surveyed 34 whitefly populations collected from the states of Sao Paulo, Bahia, Minas Gerais and Parana in Brazil, for species identification and for infection with secondary endosymbionts. Sequencing the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I gene revealed the existence of five whitefly species: The sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci B biotype (recently termed Middle East-Asia Minor 1 or MEAM1), the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum, B. tabaci A biotype (recently termed New World 2 or NW2) collected only from Euphorbia, the Acacia whitefly Tetraleurodes acaciae and Bemisia tuberculata both were detected only on cassava. Sequencing rRNA genes showed that Hamiltonella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent in all MEAM1 populations, while Cardinium was close to fixation in only three populations. Surprisingly, some MEAM1 individuals and one NW2 population were infected with Fritschea. Arsenopnohus was the only endosymbiont detected in T. vaporariorum. In T. acaciae and B. tuberculata populations collected from cassava, Wolbachia was fixed in B. tuberculata and was highly prevalent in T. acaciae. Interestingly, while B. tuberculata was additionally infected with Arsenophonus, T. acaciae was infected with Cardinium and Fritschea. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on representative individuals showed that Hamiltonella, Arsenopnohus and Fritschea were localized inside the bacteriome, Cardinium and Wolbachia exhibited dual localization patterns inside and outside the bacteriome, and Rickettsia showed strict localization outside the bacteriome. This study is the first survey of whitely populations collected in Brazil, and provides further insights into the complexity of infection with secondary endosymionts in whiteflies."

https://openalex.org/W1981520949,"miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are two important tumor suppressor microRNAs, which control several cancer-related genes and processes. In the present report, we have shown that these microRNAs bind specific sites at the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA-binding protein AUF1, leading to its down-regulation. This inverse correlation between the levels of these microRNAs and AUF1 has been identified in various osteosarcoma cell lines. Additionally, we present clear evidence that AUF1 promotes mesenchymal features in osteosarcoma cells and that miR-141 and miR-146b-5p suppress this prometastatic process through AUF1 repression. Indeed, both microRNAs suppressed the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of osteosarcoma cells through inhibiting the AKT protein kinase in an AUF1-dependent manner. We have also shown that AUF1 binds to and stabilizes the mRNA of the AKT activator phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Furthermore, miR-141 and miR-146b-5p positively regulate the epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Epcam) and repress the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist2, and ZEB1). These effects were mediated via the repression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal inducer ZEB1 through targeting AUF1, which binds the 3′-UTR of the ZEB1 mRNA and reduces its turnover. These results indicate that at least some tumor suppressor functions of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are mediated through the repression of the oncogenic potentials of AUF1. Therefore, these 3′-UTR-directed post-transcriptional gene expression regulators constitute promising new targets for diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are two important tumor suppressor microRNAs, which control several cancer-related genes and processes. In the present report, we have shown that these microRNAs bind specific sites at the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA-binding protein AUF1, leading to its down-regulation. This inverse correlation between the levels of these microRNAs and AUF1 has been identified in various osteosarcoma cell lines. Additionally, we present clear evidence that AUF1 promotes mesenchymal features in osteosarcoma cells and that miR-141 and miR-146b-5p suppress this prometastatic process through AUF1 repression. Indeed, both microRNAs suppressed the invasion/migration and proliferation abilities of osteosarcoma cells through inhibiting the AKT protein kinase in an AUF1-dependent manner. We have also shown that AUF1 binds to and stabilizes the mRNA of the AKT activator phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Furthermore, miR-141 and miR-146b-5p positively regulate the epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Epcam) and repress the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Twist2, and ZEB1).

Therefore, these 3′-UTR-directed post-transcriptional gene expression regulators constitute promising new targets for diagnostic and/or therapeutic interventions. The mRNA 3′-UTR plays an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, which is controlled by two main types of mRNA-interacting factors: RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAhnRNPDheterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein DEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionCIMcell invasion and migrationqRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCR.

One of the best characterized RNA-binding proteins is AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), also known as heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD). AUF1 is a family of four isoforms (37, 40, 42, and 45 kDa), which result from alternative splicing of a single pre-mRNA (4.Wagner B.J. DeMaria C.T. Sun Y. Wilson G.M. Brewer G.

However, many potential roles of deregulated AUF1 expression or activity in tumor initiation and/or progression remain unresolved. In addition, little is known about the mechanisms that control AUF1 expression in many cellular contexts, including those that enhance AUF1 levels during carcinogenesis. microRNA heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D epithelial-mesenchymal transition cell invasion and migration quantitative RT-PCR. The other important 3′-UTR-related post-transcriptional regulators are miRNAs, which belong to a large family of non-coding RNAs. Mature miRNAs are 21–23-bp-long molecules, which regulate the expression of a plethora of genes involved in various biochemical pathways. Therefore, alteration of their expression is related to various diseases, including cancer (18.Iorio M.V. Croce C.M. MicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics. A comprehensive review.EMBO Mol. Med. 2012; 4: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Indeed, miRNAs act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and are involved in various steps of the carcinogenesis process, including metastasis. Recent data showed their implication in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process (19.Hao J. Zhang Y. Deng M. Ye R. Zhao S. Wang Y. Li J. Zhao Z. MicroRNA control of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer stem cells.Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 135: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). During EMT, cells lose their epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and Epcam, whereas the mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin, are up-regulated, resulting in loss of cell-cell contact and increase in the migration/invasion abilities. The EMT program is regulated by several transcription factors, including SNAIL, ZEB1, and TWIST (20.Lamouille S. Xu J. Derynck R. Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 178-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (5269) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a, hereafter referred to as p16, negatively regulates the expression of AUF1 through activating the turnover of its mRNA (10.Al-Khalaf H.H.

Interestingly, the two miRNAs have been computationally predicted to have binding sites in the 3′-UTR of the AUF1 transcript (22.Asirvatham A.J. Gregorie C.J. Hu Z. Magner W.J. Tomasi T.B.

Therefore, we sought to explore here the possible implication of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p in the post-transcriptional regulation of AUF1. We have shown here that miR-141 and miR-146b-5p repress mesenchymal features through targeting AUF1-ZEB1 in osteosarcoma cells. The p16-defective osteosarcoma U2OS cell line and its isogenic EH1, which expresses CDKN2A under the control of an isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter, are a generous gift from Dr. G.

Osteosarcoma cell lines (HOS, MG63, 143B, and SaOS2) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in a 37 °C humidified incubator. Actinomycin D was purchased from Sigma. miRNA targets were predicted using algorithms, including miRanda Human miRNA targets, miRDB, RNA22, and miROrg. To identify the genes commonly predicted by these different algorithms, the results of predicted targets were intersected using miRWalk. Total RNA, containing miRNA, was purified using the miRNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was treated with RNase-free DNase before cDNA synthesis using either the Advantage RT-PCR kit (Clontech) or miScript II RT kit (Qiagen) for mature miRNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RT2 Real-TimeTM SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen), and the amplifications were performed utilizing the Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor real-time PCR detection system. The melting curve data were collected to check PCR specificity, the amount of PCR products was measured by threshold cycle (Ct) values, and the relative ratio of specific genes to GAPDH or U6 for each sample was then calculated.

Cell lysates were prepared from confluent cells, and 3 mg were incubated in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors, 5 mm DTT, and 2 units/ml RNasin), and 5 µg of AUF1 mouse monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG1 was used as control) were added and mixed at 4 °C for 4 h. An equal volume of protein A-agarose was added per immunoprecipitation and mixed overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of TRI reagent used for RNA extraction. RT-PCRs were performed as described above. pSILENCER-AUF1 siRNA, which targets all AUF1 isoforms (24.Wang W. Martindale J.L. Yang X. Chrest F.J. Gorospe M.

Lentiviral supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection. Culture media were removed from the target cells and replaced with the lentiviral supernatant and incubated for 24 h in the presence of 1 µg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Transduced cells were selected after 48 h with puromycin or G418. AKT siRNA (specific down-regulation of AKT) (Qiagen) was used at 20 nm, and transfection was performed using RNAiFect, following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). U2OS cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well on 6-well plates and transfected with 3 µg of the luciferase/Renilla reporter vector containing either human AUF1 3′-UTR (871 bp), mutated sequence of the miR-141 or miR-146b-5p seed sequence, human ZEB1 3′-UTR (75 bp), mutated sequence of the AUF1 binding site in the corresponding sequence, human PDK1 3′-UTR, or the mutated sequence of the AUF1 binding site as well as a control sequence with no AU-rich conserved elements (GeneCopoeia). Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000, as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were consecutively measured using the Dual-Luciferase assay as recommended by the manufacturer (GeneCopoeia). The firefly luciferase signal was normalized to the Renilla luciferase signal for each individual analysis. The mean and S.E. were calculated from three wells for each 3′-UTR activity and presented as -fold change over the non-stimulated control. Northern blot analysis was performed using the High Sensitive miRNA Northern blot assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Signosis, Inc.). In brief, total RNA was prepared using miRNeasy (Qiagen), and 5 µg was separated using precast 15% TBE-urea gel (Signosis, Inc.). After transfer, nylon membranes (Signosis, Inc.) were UV-cross-linked and hybridized with DNA oligonucleotides complementary to miRNA or U6 that had been end-labeled with Biotin (Signosis, Inc.).

Biotinylation was performed using the RNA 3′-end biotinylation kit as instructed by the manufacturer (Thermo Scientific). Cytoplasmic lysates (200 µg/sample) were incubated with 3 µg of purified biotinylated transcripts for 30 min at room temperature, and then the complexes were precipitated with streptavidin-coupled Dynabeads (Invitrogen) as described previously (3.Tominaga K.

Cells were challenged with actinomycin D (5 µg/ml) for various periods of time (0–6 h), and then total RNA was purified and assessed using qRT-PCR. One-phase exponential decay curve analysis (GraphPad Prism) (GraphPad software 5.03, Inc.) was used to assess mRNA decay kinetics (25.Al-Haj L. Blackshear P.J. Khabar K.S.

These assays were performed in label-free real-time settings using the xCELLigence RTCA technology (Roche Applied Science), which measures impedance changes in a meshwork of interdigitated gold microelectrodes located at the well bottom (E-plate) or at the bottom side of a microporous membrane (CIM plate 16) (26.Knopfová L.

In brief, 2 × 104 cells in serum-free medium were added to the upper wells of the CIM plate coated with a thin layer of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) basement membrane matrix diluted 1:20 in serum-free medium (for invasion) or non-coated (for migration). A complete medium was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber. Subsequently, the plates were incubated in the RTCA for 24 h, and the impedance value of each well was automatically monitored by the xCELLigence system and expressed as a cell index value, which represents cell status based on the measured electrical impedance change divided by a background value. Each assay was biologically performed in triplicate. For the proliferation assay, exponentially growing cells (2 × 104) were seeded in an E-plate with complete medium as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cell proliferation was assessed for 48 h. All data were recorded and analyzed by the RTCA software. Cell index was used to measure the change in the electrical impedance divided by background value, which represents cell status. Each assay was biologically performed in triplicate (28.Adams C.J. Pike A.C. Maniam S. Sharpe T.D. Coutts A.S. Knapp S. La Thangue N.B. Bullock A.N.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test, and p values of 0.05 and less were considered as statistically significant. In order to investigate the possible implication of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p in p16-dependent regulation of AUF1, we first made use of miRNA databases to analyze the 3′-UTR of the AUF1 transcript. The AUF1 3′-UTR contains two potential binding sites for miR-141 located at bases 297–304 (mirSVR score = −0.2859) and 820–825 (mirSVR score = −0.0174) and one potential binding site for miR-146b-5p with high complementarity located at bases 171–178 (mirSVR score = −1.3007) (Fig. 1A). These regions are highly conserved among different species (Fig. 1B). To study the effect of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p on AUF1 expression, the respective precursors were ectopically expressed in the p16-defective U2OS cells, and the skin fibroblast HFSN1 cells expressing CDKN2A shRNA (HFSN1p16sh). Both types of cells express low levels of these miRNAs (21.Al-Khalaf H.H. Mohideen P. Nallar S.C. Kalvakolanu D.V. Aboussekhra A. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a physically interacts with transcription factor Sp1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 to transactivate microRNA-141 and microRNA-146b-5p spontaneously and in response to ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 35511-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but high levels of AUF1 (10.Al-Khalaf H.H. Colak D. Al-Saif M. Al-Bakheet A. Hendrayani S.F. Al-Yousef N. Kaya N. Khabar K.S. Aboussekhra A. p16INK4a positively regulates cyclin D1 and E2F1 through negative control of AUF1.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e21111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). EH1 (U2OS isogenic cells, which express low levels of p16) and HFSN1 cells expressing a scrambled shRNA sequence (HFSN1C) were used as respective controls. Next, total RNA was prepared from these cells, and the level of the AUF1 mRNA was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Fig. 1C shows that the increase in the levels of pre-miR-141 and pre-miR-146b-5p reduced the level of the AUF1 mRNA 4- and 4.8-fold in U2OS and HFSN1p16sh cells, respectively. This level is similar to the AUF1 level observed in the EH1 and HFSN1C cells, which express normal levels of both miRNAs. These data indicate that miR-141 and miR-146b-5p are potential negative regulators of AUF1, and their expression mirrors the level of p16. To confirm the increase in the level of the mature forms of these miRNAs following the ectopic expression of their precursors, we made use of the RNA prepared above to assess the levels of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p using Northern blotting. Fig. 1D shows that ectopic expression of pre-miR-141 and pre-miR-146b-5p in U2OS and HFSN1p16sh cells increased the expression of the mature forms of these miRNAs. To further evaluate the contribution of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p in the negative regulation of the AUF1 expression, miR-141 and miR-146b-5p were inhibited by specific anti-miRNAs (miRZips) in p16-proficient HFSN1 and EH1 cells, which express both miRNAs. A nonspecific sequence was used as control. Fig. 2A shows that the inhibition of miR-141 increased the expression level of the AUF1 mRNA in EH1 and HFSN1 cells. Similar results were obtained upon the inhibition of miR-146b-5p (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that, like p16, miR-141 and miR-146b-5p negatively regulate the AUF1 expression. Next, we sought to evaluate the combined effect of both miR-141 and miR-146b-5p on the expression of AUF1. To this end, U2OS cells were sequentially co-transfected with pre-miR-141 and pre-miR-146b-5p, and total RNA was prepared from these cells and their controls. Subsequently, the level of mature miRNAs was assessed by qRT-PCR. Fig. 1E (left) shows clear up-regulation of both miRNAs in cells co-transfected with their precursors. Fig. 1E (right) shows that the level of the AUF1 mRNA did not further decrease in U2OS cells co-expressing both pre-miR-141 and pre-miR-146b-5p as compared with the AUF1 level in cells expressing only one of these miRNAs. Next, we sought to evaluate the potential contribution of the miR-141 and miR-146b-5p binding sites in the AUF1 mRNA 3′-UTR to the regulation of AUF1 expression. To this end, intact AUF1 3′-UTR or mutated sequence for these binding sites was inserted into a luciferase/Renilla reporter vector (Fig. 2C) and introduced into U2OS cells stably expressing pre-miR-141, pre-miR-146b-5p, or empty vector (control). The reporter activity fused to the intact sequence of the AUF1 3′-UTR was significantly reduced in U2OS cells expressing pre-miR-141 or pre-miR-146b-5p as compared with the control cells (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, this effect was abolished by mutating the putative miR-141 or miR-146b-5p binding sites within the 3′-UTR of the AUF1 mRNA (Fig. 2, D and E). This indicates that the effect of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p on AUF1 is mediated through interaction with their seeding sequence in the AUF1 3′-UTR. To investigate the effect of miR-141 and miR-146b-5p on the expression of the AUF1 protein, whole cell extracts were first prepared from EH1 cells expressing either miRZip-141, miRZip-146b-5p, or their control plasmid. Subsequently, the level of the AUF1 protein was assessed by immunoblotting. Fig. 3A shows that the inhibition of miR-141 increased 3-fold the level of the AUF1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2095444440,"A small-molecule activator of procaspase 3, 1541, forms chemical fibrils. shRNA screens, caspase proteomics and small-molecule profiling reveal that these fibrils enter cells through endocytosis and promote a distinctive form of cell death. We previously discovered a small-molecule inducer of cell death, named 1541, that noncovalently self-assembles into chemical fibrils ('chemi-fibrils') and activates procaspase-3 in vitro. We report here that 1541-induced cell death is caused by the fibrillar rather than the soluble form of the drug. A short hairpin RNA screen reveals that knockdown of genes involved in endocytosis, vesicle trafficking and lysosomal acidification causes partial 1541 resistance. We confirm the role of these pathways using pharmacological inhibitors. Microscopy shows that the fluorescent chemi-fibrils accumulate in punctae inside cells that partially colocalize with lysosomes. Notably, the chemi-fibrils bind and induce liposome leakage in vitro, suggesting they may do the same in cells. The chemi-fibrils induce extensive proteolysis including caspase substrates, yet modulatory profiling reveals that chemi-fibrils form a distinct class from existing inducers of cell death. The chemi-fibrils share similarities with proteinaceous fibrils and may provide insight into their mechanism of cellular toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2164597323,"Objectives The surgical safety checklist (SSC) is meant to enhance patient safety but studies of its impact conflict. This study explored factors that influenced SSC adherence to suggest how its impact could be optimized. Methods Participants were recruited purposively by profession, region, hospital type and time using the SSC. They were asked to describe how the SSC was adopted, associated challenges, perceived impact, and suggestions for improving its use. Grounded theory and thematic analysis were used to collect and analyse data. Findings were interpreted using an implementation fidelity conceptual framework. Results Fifty-one participants were interviewed (29 nurses, 13 surgeons, 9 anaesthetists; 18 small, 14 large and 19 teaching hospitals; 8 regions; 31 had used the SC for ≤12 months, 20 for 13+ months). The SSC was inconsistently reviewed, and often inaccurately documented as complete. Adherence was influenced by multiple issues. Extensive modification to accommodate existing practice patterns eliminated essential interaction at key time points to discuss patient management. Staff were often absent or not paying attention. They did not feel it was relevant to their work given limited evidence of its effectiveness, and because they were not engaged in its implementation. Organizations provided little support for implementation, training, monitoring and feedback, which are needed to overcome these, and other individual and team factors that challenged SSC adherence. Responses were similar across participants with different characteristics. Conclusions Multiple processes and factors influenced SSC adherence. This may explain why, in studies evaluating SSC impact, outcomes were variable. Recommendations included continuing education, time for pilot-testing, and engaging all staff in SSC review. Others may use the implementation fidelity framework to plan SSC implementation or evaluate SSC adherence. Further research is needed to establish which SSC components can be modified without compromising its effectiveness."

https://openalex.org/W1848573720,"DNA polymerases and substrates undergo conformational changes upon forming protein-ligand complexes. These conformational adjustments can hasten or deter DNA synthesis and influence substrate discrimination. From structural comparison of binary DNA and ternary DNA-dNTP complexes of DNA polymerase β, several side chains have been implicated in facilitating formation of an active ternary complex poised for chemistry. Site-directed mutagenesis of these highly conserved residues (Asp-192, Arg-258, Phe-272, Glu-295, and Tyr-296) and kinetic characterization provides insight into the role these residues play during correct and incorrect insertion as well as their role in conformational activation. The catalytic efficiencies for correct nucleotide insertion for alanine mutants were wild type ∼ R258A > F272A ∼ Y296A > E295A > D192A. Because the efficiencies for incorrect insertion were affected to about the same extent for each mutant, the effects on fidelity were modest (<5-fold). The R258A mutant exhibited an increase in the single-turnover rate of correct nucleotide insertion. This suggests that the wild-type Arg-258 side chain generates a population of non-productive ternary complexes. Structures of binary and ternary substrate complexes of the R258A mutant and a mutant associated with gastric carcinomas, E295K, provide molecular insight into intermediate structural conformations not appreciated previously. Although the R258A mutant crystal structures were similar to wild-type enzyme, the open ternary complex structure of E295K indicates that Arg-258 stabilizes a non-productive conformation of the primer terminus that would decrease catalysis. Significantly, the open E295K ternary complex binds two metal ions indicating that metal binding cannot overcome the modified interactions that have interrupted the closure of the N-subdomain.

DNA polymerases and their ligands (dNTP, DNA, metals) undergo conformational adjustments upon complex formation. These conformational changes may be global in scope as exemplified by protein subdomain repositioning (1.Doublié S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T.

These activities reside in separate domains: a 31-kDa polymerase domain and an 8-kDa amino-terminal lyase domain. The polymerase domain is structurally organized into functionally distinct subdomains referred to as DNA binding (D, residues 90–150), catalytic (C, 151–260), and nascent base pair binding (N, residues 261–335) subdomains (5.Beard W.A.

These transitions are believed to play a critical role during substrate discrimination, i.e. facilitate selecting right from wrong dNTPs. This is generally referred to as “induced fit” where binding of the correct nucleoside triphosphate results in an optimal alignment of catalytic residues that promotes binding and catalysis. In contrast, an incorrect dNTP leads to alternate protein/substrate conformations that discourage insertion. The kinetic result is that an incorrect substrate exhibits a lower apparent binding affinity (Kd) and decreased rate of nucleotide insertion (kpol) relative to those for the correct incoming nucleotide. Crystallographic structures of binary DNA and ternary substrate complexes of pol β suggest that DNA and several protein side chains alter their position and/or interactions upon nucleotide binding (8.Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H.

These interactions may provide a means by which the polymerase active site (i.e. metal binding ligands) detects whether the N-subdomain is able to form a stable closed complex. Alanine substitution for Arg-283 (>15 Å from the active site) results in a catalytically compromised enzyme that exhibits diminished fidelity (19.Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R.

We now examine the role of several other residues that alter their interactions during formation of the closed ternary complex in modulating catalytic activation and fidelity. Ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, and MicroSpin G-25 columns were from Amersham Biosciences-GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a procedure described previously (19.Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. Enzyme-DNA interactions required for efficient nucleotide incorporation and discrimination in human DNA polymerase β.J. Biol.

The codons for Asp-192, Arg-258, Phe-272, Glu-295, or Tyr-296 were altered to generate single alanine substitutions. Additionally, a double alanine mutant was generated at residues 258 and 272 (R258A/F272A), and an alternate lysine substitution was created at position 295 (E295K). To ensure that the resulting pol β gene contained the desired change(s), the entire coding sequence of the mutant was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Each mutant was cloned into pWL-11 (22.Patterson T.A. Little W. Cheng X. Widen S.G. Kumar A. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Molecular cloning and high-level expression of human polymerase β cDNA and comparison of the purified recombinant human and rat enzymes.Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 18: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), a bacterial expression plasmid containing the λ PL promoter and overexpressed in Escherichia coli TAP56 cells. Wild-type and mutant proteins were purified as described previously (23.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Purification and domain-mapping of mammalian DNA polymerase®.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by Coomassie dye binding using purified pol β as the standard. The concentration of purified pol β was determined by total amino acid analysis. A 34-mer oligonucleotide DNA substrate containing a single nucleotide gap was prepared by annealing 3 gel-purified oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA) to create a single nucleotide gap at position 16. Each oligonucleotide was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA, and the concentration was determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of 10 µm primer with 12 µm concentrations each of downstream and template oligonucleotides at 90–100 °C for 3 min followed by 30 min at 65 °C and then slow cooling to room temperature. The sequence of the gapped DNA substrate was: primer, 5′-CTG CAG CTG ATG CGC-3′; downstream oligonucleotide, 5′-GTA CGG ATC CCC GGG TAC-3′; template, 3′-GAC GTC GAC TAC GCG XCA TGC CTA GGG GCC CAT G-5′, where the X represents T or G. The primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), and radioactive ATP was removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column. The downstream oligonucleotide was synthesized with a 5′-phosphate. Steady-state kinetic parameters for single nucleotide gap-filling reactions were determined by initial velocity measurements as described previously (24.Cavanaugh N.A. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β ribonucleotide discrimination: insertion, misinsertion, extension, and coding.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24457-24465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (37 °C), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 nm single nucleotide-gapped DNA. Due to the lower stability of the R258A mutant at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 50 µg/ml BSA. BSA does not influence the activity of the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme concentrations and reaction time intervals were chosen so that substrate depletion or product inhibition did not influence initial velocity measurements. Reactions were stopped with 20 µl of 0.5 m EDTA and mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye, and the products were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to quantify product formation. To directly measure the rate of the first insertion (kpol) and the apparent equilibrium nucleotide dissociation constant (Kd), single-turnover kinetic assays (enzyme/DNA = 10) were performed as outlined previously (25.Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. DNA structure and aspartate 276 influence nucleotide binding to human DNA polymerase β: implication for the identity of the rate-limiting conformational change.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) employing a KinTek Model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Typically, a solution of pol β (1 µm) was preincubated with single nucleotide-gapped DNA (100 nm). This solution was rapidly mixed (2-fold dilution) with various concentrations of dNTP/Mg2+. Final conditions (pH, temperature) and salt concentrations were like those described for the steady-state assay. After various time periods, the reactions were stopped with 0.25 m EDTA, and the quenched samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye. Products were separated and quantified as described above. Under these conditions the first-order rate constant of the exponential time-courses was dependent on the concentration of dNTP. A secondary plot of the concentration dependence of kobs was hyperbolic and fitted by a non-linear least-squares method to Equation 1 where kpol is the intrinsic rate constant for the step limiting the first insertion. kobs=kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])(Eq. 1) The DNA substrate consisted of a 16-mer template, a complementary 10-mer primer strand, and a 5-mer downstream oligonucleotide. The annealed 10-mer primer creates a one-nucleotide gap with a templating A residue. The downstream oligonucleotide is 5′-phosphorylated. The template sequence was 5′-CCG ACA GCG CAT CAG C-3′ (the underlined base is the coding nucleotide). Oligonucleotides were dissolved in 20 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Each set of template, primer, and downstream oligonucleotide was mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio and annealed using a PCR thermocycler by heating 10 min at 90 °C and cooling to 4 °C (1 °C/min) resulting in a 1 mm mixture of gapped duplex DNA. This solution was then mixed with an equal volume of mutant (R258A or E295K) pol β at 4 °C, and the mixture warmed to 35 °C and gradually cooled to 4 °C. Pol β-DNA complexes were crystallized by sitting-drop vapor diffusion. The crystallization buffer was 16% PEG-3350, 350 mm sodium acetate, and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Drops were incubated at 18 °C and streak-seeded after 1 day. Crystals grew in ∼2–4 days after seeding. The ternary complex was obtained by soaking crystals of binary 1-nucleotide-gapped DNA complexes in artificial mother liquor with 100 mm MgCl2 or 50 mm MnCl2 and with 2 mm dUMPNPP, 20% PEG-3350, and 12% ethylene glycol and then flash-frozen to 100 K in a nitrogen stream. All crystals belong to the space group P21. X-ray crystal diffraction data were collected on a Saturn 92 CCD detector system mounted on a MicroMax-007HF (Rigaku Corp.) rotating anode generator. Data were integrated and reduced for structure refinement with HKL2000 software (26.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38507) Google Scholar). Structures were determined by molecular replacement with previously determined structures of pol β complexed with a one-nucleotide gapped DNA (binary complex, PDB ID 3ISB) (27.Beard W.A. Shock D.D.

Comparing crystallographic structures of different liganded states of pol β indicate that DNA around the active site and several side chains of the C- and N-subdomains alter their interactions upon going from an open binary DNA complex to a closed ternary substrate complex (8.Sawaya M.R.

Specifically, when the N-subdomain is in the open “inactive” conformation, Asp-192 forms a salt bridge with Arg-258 thereby diverting a critical metal coordinating ligand (Fig. 1B). A conservative glutamate substitution at Asp-192 (D192E) results in a dramatic loss of activity highlighting the critical role of this residue (32.Date T. Yamamoto S. Tanihara K. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. Aspartic acid residues at positions 190 and 192 of rat polymerase β are involved in primer binding.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5286-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Asp-190 and Asp-192 coordinate both Mg2+ ions necessary for catalysis. In the closed conformation, the phenylalanine ring of residue 272 is positioned between Asp-192 and Arg-258, thereby insulating these residues. Asp-192 and Arg-258 have rotated away from one another to coordinate active site metals or form hydrogen bonds with Glu-295 and Tyr-296, respectively. Interestingly, a lysine mutant at residue 295 has been detected in some human gastric cancers and a role in modulating base excision repair suggested (33.Iwanaga A. Ouchida M. Miyazaki K. Hori K.

Res. 1999; 435: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling of the N-subdomain movement has suggested that side-chain motions do not occur in a concerted manner but follow a sequential path (34.Yang L. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Broyde S.

To probe the functional significance of these residues, alanine has been substituted for Asp-192 (D192A), Arg-258 (R258A), Phe-272 (F272A), Glu-295 (E295A), or Tyr-296 (Y296A). Additionally, lysine was substituted for Glu-295 (E295K) to address the functional consequences that may lead to the observed biological repercussions (33.Iwanaga A. Ouchida M. Miyazaki K. Hori K. Mukai T. Functional mutation of DNA polymerase β found in human gastric cancer: inability of the base excision repair in vitro.Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. The purified mutant pol β proteins were >95% homogeneous and devoid of contaminating exonuclease activity (data not shown). The catalytic consequences of these protein modifications were assessed. To analyze the effect of the altered side chain on DNA synthesis, we determined steady-state kinetic parameters for insertion of a correct nucleotide (dATP or dCTP) into a single nucleotide-gapped heteropolymeric DNA substrate (templating thymine or guanine, respectively) (Table 1; Fig. 2). For most mutants, kcat for correct insertion was minimally affected by alanine substitution. The R258A mutant exhibited a modest increase in the respective turnover numbers for correct insertion. However, it should be noted that the steady-state rate of correct nucleotide insertion is partially limited by at least two kinetic steps, chemistry and product dissociation (25.Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. DNA structure and aspartate 276 influence nucleotide binding to human DNA polymerase β: implication for the identity of the rate-limiting conformational change.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, kcat is significantly decreased for incorrect insertion relative to wild-type enzyme for the alanine mutants of Phe-272, Glu-295, and Tyr-296. In these cases, Km,incorrect is hardly affected. It is generally believed that the rate of incorrect nucleotide insertion is limited by chemistry so that Km,incorrect represents the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, for the incorrect nucleotide.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic summary for single nucleotide gap-filling DNA substratesEnzymeTemplate dNTPaTemplate nucleotide-incoming nucleoside triphosphate.kcatKm,dNTPkcat/Km10−2 s−1µm10−4 µm−1s−1Wild typedT-dATP90 (10)1.1 (0.04)8200 (1000)dT-dGTP9 (1)480 (110)1.9 (0.5)dG-dCTP58 (3)0.40 (0.10)14500 (3700)dG-dTTP4.1 (0.3)1300 (170)0.31 (0.05)D192AdG-dCTPIbInactive.D192EdG-dCTPNDcUnder steady-state conditions, reliable kinetic parameters activity could not be determined.R258AdT-dATP180 (20)7.9 (0.4)2300 (300)dT-dGTP4 (0.9)1635 (98)0.24 (0.06)dG-dCTP120 (6)3.2 (0.9)3750 (1070)dG-dTTP2.1 (0.1)1150 (100)0.18 (0.02)F272AdT-dATP20 (1)7.2 (1.6)280 (60)dT-dGTP0.22 (0.06)1200 (40)0.018 (0.005)dG-dCTP6.5 (0.2)1.3 (0.2)500 (80)dG-dTTP0.076 (0.001)1448 (46)0.0052 (0.0002)E295AdT-dATP15.0 (1.0)70 (6)21 (2)dT-dGTPNDdG-dCTP14.2 (0.7)20 (2)71 (8)dG-dTTPNDE295KdG-dCTPNDY296AdT-dATP86 (20)75 (8)115 (30)dT-dGTP0.05 (0.01)450 (50)0.011 (0.002)dG-dCTP66 (8)29 (3)230 (40)dG-dTTP0.049 (0.003)1023 (120)0.0048 (0.0006)a Template nucleotide-incoming nucleoside triphosphate.b Inactive.c Under steady-state conditions, reliable kinetic parameters activity could not be determined.

https://openalex.org/W1976098093,"The role of pathogen-mediated febrile illness in sub-Saharan Africa is receiving more attention, especially in Southern Africa where four countries (including Namibia) are actively working to eliminate malaria. With a high concentration of livestock and high rates of companion animal ownership, the influence of zoonotic bacterial diseases as causes of febrile illness in Namibia remains unknown.The aim of the study was to evaluate exposure to Coxiella burnetii, spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae, and Bartonella henselae using IFA and ELISA (IgG) in serum collected from 319 volunteer blood donors identified by the Blood Transfusion Service of Namibia (NAMBTS). Serum samples were linked to a basic questionnaire to identify possible risk factors. The majority of the participants (64.8%) had extensive exposure to rural areas or farms. Results indicated a C. burnetii prevalence of 26.1% (screening titre 1∶16), and prevalence rates of 11.9% and 14.9% (screening titre 1∶100) for spotted fever group and typhus group rickettsiae, respectively. There was a significant spatial association between C. burnetii exposure and place of residence in southern Namibia (P<0.021). Donors with occupations involving animals (P>0.012), especially cattle (P>0.006), were also significantly associated with C. burnetii exposure. Males were significantly more likely than females to have been exposed to spotted fever (P<0.013) and typhus (P<0.011) group rickettsiae. Three (2.9%) samples were positive for B. henselae possibly indicating low levels of exposure to a pathogen never reported in Namibia.These results indicate that Namibians are exposed to pathogenic fever-causing bacteria, most of which have flea or tick vectors/reservoirs. The epidemiology of febrile illnesses in Namibia needs further evaluation in order to develop comprehensive local diagnostic and treatment algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2011492468,"The intracellular mechanisms underlying memory reconsolidation critically involve cAMP signaling. These events were originally attributed to PKA activation by cAMP, but the identification of Exchange Protein Activated by cAMP (Epac), as a distinct mediator of cAMP signaling, suggests that cAMP-regulated processes that subserve memory reconsolidation are more complex. Here we investigated how activation of Epac with 8-pCPT-cAMP (8-CPT) impacts reconsolidation of a memory that had been associated with cocaine self-administration. Rats were trained to lever press for cocaine on an FR-1 schedule, in which each cocaine delivery was paired with a tone+light cue. Lever pressing was then extinguished in the absence of cue presentations and cocaine delivery. Following the last day of extinction, rats were put in a novel context, in which the conditioned cue was presented to reactivate the cocaine-associated memory. Immediate bilateral infusions of 8-CPT into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) following reactivation disrupted subsequent cue-induced reinstatement in a dose-dependent manner, and modestly reduced responding for conditioned reinforcement. When 8-CPT infusions were delayed for 3 hours after the cue reactivation session or were given after a cue extinction session, no effect on cue-induced reinstatement was observed. Co-administration of 8-CPT and the PKA activator 6-Bnz-cAMP (10 nmol/side) rescued memory reconsolidation while 6-Bnz alone had no effect, suggesting an antagonizing interaction between the two cAMP signaling substrates. Taken together, these studies suggest that activation of Epac represents a parallel cAMP-dependent pathway that can inhibit reconsolidation of cocaine-cue memories and reduce the ability of the cue to produce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2076658527,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease that arises from mutations in the dystrophin-encoding gene. Apart from muscle pathology, cognitive impairment, primarily of developmental origin, is also a significant component of the disorder. Convergent lines of evidence point to an important role for dystrophin in regulating the molecular machinery of central synapses. The clustering of neurotransmitter receptors at inhibitory synapses, thus impacting on synaptic transmission, is of particular significance. However, less is known about the role of dystrophin in influencing the precise expression patterns of proteins located within the pre- and postsynaptic elements of inhibitory synapses. To this end, we exploited molecular markers of inhibitory synapses, interneurons and dystrophin-deficient mouse models to explore the role of dystrophin in determining the stereotypical patterning of inhibitory connectivity within the cellular networks of the hippocampus CA1 region. In tissue from wild-type (WT) mice, immunoreactivity of neuroligin2 (NL2), an adhesion molecule expressed exclusively in postsynaptic elements of inhibitory synapses, and the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), a marker of GABAergic presynaptic elements, were predictably enriched in strata pyramidale and lacunosum moleculare. In acute contrast, NL2 and VGAT immunoreactivity was relatively evenly distributed across all CA1 layers in dystrophin-deficient mice. Similar changes were evident with the cannabinoid receptor 1, vesicular glutamate transporter 3, parvalbumin, somatostatin and the GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit. The data show that in the absence of dystrophin, there is a rearrangement of the molecular machinery, which underlies the precise spatio-temporal pattern of GABAergic synaptic transmission within the CA1 sub-field of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2053884409,"Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP or amylin) forms amyloid deposits in the islets of Langerhans; a process that is believed to contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes and to the failure of islet transplants. An emerging theme in amyloid research is the hypothesis that the toxic species produced during amyloid formation by different polypeptides share common features and exert their effects by common mechanisms. If correct, this suggests that inhibitors of amyloid formation by one polypeptide might be effective against other amyloidogenic sequences. IAPP and Aβ, the peptide responsible for amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease, are particularly interesting in this regard as they are both natively unfolded in their monomeric states and share some common characteristics. Comparatively little effort has been expended on the design of IAPP amyloid inhibitors, thus it is natural to inquire if Aβ inhibitors are effective against IAPP, especially since no IAPP inhibitors have been clinically approved. A range of compounds inhibit Aβ amyloid formation, including various stereoisomers of inositol. Myo-, scyllo-, and epi-inositol have been shown to induce conformational changes in Aβ and prevent Aβ amyloid fibril formation by stabilizing non-fibrillar β-sheet structures. We investigate the ability of inositol stereoisomers to inhibit amyloid formation by IAPP. The compounds do not induce a conformational change in IAPP and are ineffective inhibitors of IAPP amyloid formation, although some do lead to modest apparent changes in IAPP amyloid fibril morphology. Thus not all classes of Aβ inhibitors are effective against IAPP. This work provides a basis of comparison to work on polyphenol based inhibitors of IAPP amyloid formation and helps provide clues as to the features which render them effective. The study also helps provide information for further efforts in rational inhibitor design."

However, plasma TFPI-2 levels are negligible (≤20 pm) in the context of influencing clotting or fibrinolysis. Here, we report that platelets contain significant amounts of TFPI-2 derived from megakaryocytes. We employed RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy to determine that platelets, MEG-01 megakaryoblastic cells, and bone marrow megakaryocytes contain TFPI-2. ELISA data reveal that TFPI-2 binds factor V (FV) and partially B-domain-deleted FV (FV-1033) with Kd ∼9 nm and binds FVa with Kd ∼100 nm. Steady state analysis of surface plasmon resonance data reveal that TFPI-2 and TFPI-1 bind FV-1033 with Kd ∼36–48 nm and bind FVa with Kd ∼252–456 nm. Further, TFPI-1 (but not TFPI-1161) competes with TFPI-2 in binding to FV. These data indicate that the C-terminal basic region of TFPI-2 is similar to that of TFPI-1 and plays a role in binding to the FV B-domain acidic region.

Sera from patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome and multifocal motor neuropathy associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies were used. Inhibition of complement deposition subsequent to IgG or IgM autoantibody binding to ganglioside, GM1 or GQ1b was assessed on microtiter plates. Sialylated and galactosylated IVIGs more effectively inhibited C3 deposition than original IVIG or enzyme-treated IVIGs (agalactosylated and deglycosylated IVIGs). Therefore, sialylated and galactosylated IVIGs may be more effective than conventional IVIG in the treatment of complement-dependent autoimmune diseases."

Here, we characterize the Golgi SNARE protein, Gos28, and its role in rhodopsin (Rh1) transport through Drosophila photoreceptors. Mutations in gos28 lead to defective Rh1 trafficking and retinal degeneration. We have pinpointed a role for Gos28 in the intra-Golgi transport of Rh1, downstream from α-mannosidase-II in the medial- Golgi. We have confirmed the necessity of key residues in Gos28's SNARE motif and demonstrate that its transmembrane domain is not required for vesicle fusion, consistent with Gos28 functioning as a t-SNARE for Rh1 transport. Finally, we show that human Gos28 rescues both the Rh1 trafficking defects and retinal degeneration in Drosophila gos28 mutants, demonstrating the functional conservation of these proteins. Our results identify Gos28 as an essential SNARE protein in Drosophila photoreceptors and provide mechanistic insights into the role of SNAREs in neurodegenerative disease."

https://openalex.org/W2004362630,"Co-training is a major multi-view learning paradigm that alternately trains two classifiers on two distinct views and maximizes the mutual agreement on the two-view unlabeled data. Traditional co-training algorithms usually train a learner on each view separately and then force the learners to be consistent across views. Although many co-trainings have been developed, it is quite possible that a learner will receive erroneous labels for unlabeled data when the other learner has only mediocre accuracy. This usually happens in the first rounds of co-training, when there are only a few labeled examples. As a result, co-training algorithms often have unstable performance. In this paper, Hessian-regularized co-training is proposed to overcome these limitations. Specifically, each Hessian is obtained from a particular view of examples; Hessian regularization is then integrated into the learner training process of each view by penalizing the regression function along the potential manifold. Hessian can properly exploit the local structure of the underlying data manifold. Hessian regularization significantly boosts the generalizability of a classifier, especially when there are a small number of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. To evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted on the unstructured social activity attribute (USAA) dataset for social activity recognition. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods, including the traditional co-training and LapCo algorithms."

We exploited here the recently described human pancreatic beta cell line EndoC-βH2 to set up experimental systems for cell cycle studies. We derived 2 populations from EndoC-βH2 cells that stably harbor the 2 genes encoding the Fucci fluorescent indicators of cell cycle, either from two vectors, or from a unique bicistronic vector. In proliferating non-synchronized cells, the 2 Fucci indicators revealed cells in the expected phases of cell cycle, with orange and green cells being in G1 and S/G2/M cells, respectively, and allowed the sorting of cells in different substeps of G1. The Fucci indicators also faithfully red out alterations in human beta cell proliferative activity since a mitogen-rich medium decreased the proportion of orange cells and inflated the green population, while reciprocal changes were observed when cells were induced to cease proliferation and increased expression of some beta cell genes. In the last situation, acquisition of a more differentiated beta cell phenotype correlates with an increased intensity in orange fluorescence. Hence Fucci beta cell lines provide new tools to address important questions regarding human beta cell cycle and differentiation."

In this study, we investigated the association between circulating APN and outcomes among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using data and plasma samples from participants in the multicenter ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. Results Plasma APN concentrations were measured in 816 (81.6%) trial participants at baseline and in 568 (56.8%) subjects at both baseline and day 7 after enrollment. Clinical factors associated with baseline APN levels in multivariable-adjusted models included sex, body mass index, past medical history of cirrhosis, and central venous pressure (model R2 = 9.7%). We did not observe an association between baseline APN and either severity of illness (APACHE III) or extent of lung injury (Lung Injury Score). Among patients who received right heart catheterization (n = 384), baseline APN was inversely related to mean pulmonary artery pressure (β = −0.015, R2 1.5%, p = 0.02); however, this association did not persist in multivariable models (β = −0.009, R2 0.5%, p = 0.20). Neither baseline APN levels [HR per quartile1.04 (95% CI 0.91–1.18), p = 0.61], nor change in APN level from baseline to day 7 [HR 1.04 (95% CI 0.89–1.23), p = 0.62)] were associated with 60 day mortality in Cox proportional hazards regression models. However, subgroup analysis identified an association between APN and mortality among patients who developed ARDS from extra-pulmonary etiologies [HR per quartile 1.31 (95% CI 1.08–1.57)]. APN levels did not correlate with mortality among patients developing ARDS in association with direct pulmonary injury [HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.83–1.13)], pinteraction = 0.016. Conclusions Plasma APN levels did not correlate with disease severity or mortality in a large cohort of patients with ARDS.

Our results indicate that PKCδI expression level is high in preadipocytes and decreasing PKCδI accelerated terminal differentiation. Our results indicate that PKCδI is required for mitotic clonal expansion of preadipocytes. We next evaluated the splice factor regulating the expression of PKCδI during 3T3L1 adipogenesis. Our results show TRA2B increased PKCδI expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism, we cloned a heterologous splicing PKCδ minigene and showed that inclusion of PKCδ exon 9 is increased by TRA2B. Using mutagenesis and a RNA-immunoprecipitation assay, we evaluated the binding of Tra2β on PKCδI exon 9 and show that its association is required for PKCδI splicing.

R., You, M., Bisht, K. S., and Patel, N. A. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 26834–26846). Here, we evaluated the role of PKCδI splice variant during adipogenesis. Our results indicate that PKCδI expression level is high in preadipocytes and decreasing PKCδI accelerated terminal differentiation. Our results indicate that PKCδI is required for mitotic clonal expansion of preadipocytes. We next evaluated the splice factor regulating the expression of PKCδI during 3T3L1 adipogenesis. Our results show TRA2B increased PKCδI expression. To investigate the molecular mechanism, we cloned a heterologous splicing PKCδ minigene and showed that inclusion of PKCδ exon 9 is increased by TRA2B. Using mutagenesis and a RNA-immunoprecipitation assay, we evaluated the binding of Tra2β on PKCδI exon 9 and show that its association is required for PKCδI splicing. These results provide a better understanding of the role of PKCδI in adipogenesis. Determination of this molecular mechanism of alternative splicing presents a novel therapeutic target in the management of obesity and its co-morbidities. Adipose tissue in the body is composed mainly of fat cells (adipocytes). Adipogenesis is a process in which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes. The study of adipogenesis, including the underlying cellular processes and molecular mechanisms, is important to understanding obesity. A widely used in vitro model to study adipogenesis is the 3T3L1 cell line, which was established by Green and Kehinde (3.Green H. Kehinde O. Formation of normally differentiated subcutaneous fat pads by an established preadipose cell line.J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4.Green H. Kehinde O. An established preadipose cell line and its differentiation in culture. II. Factors affecting the adipose conversion.Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). It authentically reproduces adipogenesis including expression of adipogenic genes and morphological changes. Confluent preadipocytes upon treatment with differentiation mixture enter differentiation (day 0). Cells undergo mitotic clonal expansion during which they re-enter the cell cycle, and by day 4 they are terminally differentiated. Mature adipocytes are usually established by day 7 in culture. Adipogenesis is regulated transcriptionally by PPARγ 3The abbreviations used are: PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorC/EBPCCAAT-enhancer-binding proteinTRA2Btransformer 2 β homolog (Drosophila)RIPRNA immunoprecipitationSDsplice donorSAsplice acceptorqPCRquantitative PCRIPimmunoprecipitationPRKCDprotein kinase Cδ. and C/EBP family and their co-factors, which promote the morphological and functional changes of a preadipocyte to an adipocyte phenotype characterized by cell shape and lipid accumulations (5.Brun R.P.

Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) is a member of the serine threonine PKC family. The PKC family consists of 11 isoforms and their splice variants and is involved in the regulation of cellular differentiation, growth, and apoptosis (8.Nishizuka Y. Studies and prespectives of protein kinase C.Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4034) Google Scholar). The expression of PKCδ splice variants is species-specific. PKCδI is ubiquitously present in all species. We have demonstrated the function of PKCδI in promoting apoptosis and PKCδII and PKCδVIII as pro-survival proteins (9.Patel N.A. Song S.S. Cooper D.R.

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing generates genetic diversity. This post-transcriptional process results in the expression of multiple proteins from a single gene. Alternative splicing is known to occur in >85% of genes. Trans-factors interact with pre-mRNA cis-elements to regulate alternative splicing. Splicing trans-factor SFRS10 (also known as TRA2B/Tra2β) belongs to a large family of serine-arginine (SR)-rich proteins. These proteins bind to the pre-mRNA to promote splicing of an exon. During development, alternative splicing is often regulated by the levels of the splicing trans-factors. TRA2B (transformer 2β homolog (Drosophila)) is also known as SFRS10 (11.Beil B. Screaton G. Stamm S. Molecular cloning of htra2-β-1 and htra2-β-2, two human homologs of tra-2 generated by alternative splicing.DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is highly conserved across human, mouse, and flies. A new nomenclature was introduced by Manley and Krainer (12.Manley J.L. Krainer A.R. A rational nomenclature for serine/arginine-rich protein splicing factors (SR proteins).Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 1073-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) for SR proteins in 2010. According to this nomenclature, members of the SR family of splicing factors are numbered according to the chronological order of their discovery. Based on this they have assigned SRSF10 (SR splicing factor 10) name to the splicing factor TASR1/SRp38/SRrp40. This nomenclature is not to be confused with TRA2B/SFRS10 splicing factor discussed here. Mammalian Tra2 has two isoforms: Traα and Tra2β. Tra2α plays a role in sexual differentiation similar to that in Drosophila (13.Dauwalder B. Amaya-Manzanares F. Mattox W. A human homologue of the Drosophila sex determination factor transformer-2 has conserved splicing regulatory functions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9004-9009Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). TRA2B is alternatively spliced to TRA2B1, -2, -3, -4, and -5. TRA2B1 mRNA generates a full-length protein, whereas TRA2B2 through -B5 generate truncated proteins lacking parts of RS (arginine/serine repeats) domain whose function in vivo has not yet been established. The role of TRA2B in alternative splicing is attributed to TRA2B1 (14.Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Htra2-β 1 stimulates an exonic splicing enhancer and can restore full-length SMN expression to survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). TRA2B has two RS domains flanking the central RNA recognition motif domain. TRA2B autoregulates its protein expression (15.Stoilov P. Daoud R. Nayler O. Stamm S. Human tra2-β1 autoregulates its protein concentration by influencing alternative splicing of its pre-mRNA,.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated adipogenesis and the role of PKCδI during early phases of differentiation of 3T3L1 preadipocytes. Furthermore, we identified the splice factor mediating the expression of PKCδI splice variant in 3T3L1 cells. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were purchased from ATCC® CL-173™ and passaged as preconfluent cultures in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium (DMEM) high glucose (Invitrogen) with 10% newborn calf serum (Sigma) at 37 °C and 10% CO2. Once confluent (day 0), cells were differentiated in DMEM high glucose with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlas Biological, Fort Collins, CO), 10 µg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma), 1 mm dexamethasone (Sigma), and 0.5 mm isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). On day 2, media were replaced with DMEM high glucose, 10% FBS, and bovine insulin. Day 4 and onward, cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose plus 10% FBS. Cells were trypsinized and washed one time with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cell pellet (containing one million cells) was resuspended in 500 µl of PBS and fixed by the slow, dropwise addition of 4.5 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol while vortexing. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C to complete fixation and then stored at −20 °C until stained. Fixed cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5.0 min. The cell pellet was washed twice with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µl of RNase A (100 µg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 5.0 min. One ml of PBS was added, and samples were divided to create an unstained negative control for cell cycle analysis. Propidium iodide (50 µg/ml in PBS) was added to samples to be stained and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then analyzed on the Accuri C6 flow cytometer using the FL2 channel. Pulse analysis was used to gate the single cell population and then scatter plot gating was applied to remove debris. Markers were set based on the propidium iodide histogram, and the percentage of G0G1, S phase, and G2/M cells was calculated by the Accuri C6 software. Protein lysates were obtained from 3T3L1 cells using lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. Protein lysates (40 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dried milk, washed, and incubated with anti-PKCδ (Cell Signaling), PKCδII-specific antibody (16.Apostolatos A. Song S. Acosta S. Peart M. Watson J.E. Bickford P. Cooper D.R. Patel N.A. Insulin promotes neuronal survival via the alternatively spliced protein kinase CδII isoform.J. Biol.

After incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) was used for detection. The FluorChem M™ (Protein Simple) imaging system was used to capture digital chemiluminescence images and processing Western blots. Data were analyzed using AlphaView® software. Total RNA was isolated from 3T3L1 cells with RNA-Bee (Tel Test Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two µg of RNA was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA with oligo(dT) primer or random hexamer primer and the Omniscript R kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used in PCR for the splicing minigene: PKCδ forward primer 5′-CATCCTAGGTCCTGCGACAA-3′; β-actin forward primer 5′-CTTCATTGACCTCAACTCATG-3′; reverse primer 5′-TGTCATGGATGACCTTGGCCAG-3′; SD primer 5′-TCTGAGTCACCTGGACAACC-3′; SA primer 5′-ATCTCAGTGGTATTTGTGAGC-3′. After PCR, 5% of products were resolved on 6% PAGE gels and detected by silver staining. The PCR reaction was optimized for linear range amplification to allow for quantification of products. Data were analyzed using AlphaView® software. Total RNA was isolated from 3T3L1 cells using RNAzol according to the manufacturer's protocol (TelTest Inc.). Two µg of RNA were reverse-transcribed with an Omniscript R kit (Qiagen) using oligo(dT) primers or random hexamer primers (for the RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay). QPCR was performed using 1.0 µl of cDNA and Maxima SYBR Green/Rox qPCR master mix (Thermo Scientific). The primers used were: PKCδI sense primer 5′-ACATCCTAGACAACAACGGGAC-3′ and antisense 5′ ACCACGTCCTTCTTCAGACAC-3′; PKCδII sense primer 5′-CACCATCTTCCAGAAAGAACG-3′ and antisense 5′TCGCAGGTCTCACTACTGCCTTTTCC-3′; GAPDH sense primer 5′-TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAAC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCGGCATCGAAGGTGGAAGAG-3′. Amplification was performed on the ViiaA 7 (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was then performed in triplicate on samples and standards. The plate setup included a standard series, no template control, no RNA control, no reverse transcriptase control, and no amplification control. After primer concentrations were optimized to give the desired standard curve and a single melt curve, relative quotient was determined using the ΔΔCT method with GAPDH as the endogenous control and day 0 as the calibrator sample. Experiments were repeated four times. PRKCD siRNA (ID: 103702), PKCδII-specific siRNA (ID: 444054), and scrambled siRNA were purchased from Ambion. TRA2B siRNA (ID: SR408282 A, B, C) and its scrambled control were purchased from Origene. In our experiments SR408282 A gave optimal results. These siRNA were previously validated for specificity, and off-target gene effects were eliminated. The siRNAs were transfected for 48–72 h using siPORT NeoFX® transfection agent or siTRAN transfection agent. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were trypsinized, and cell pellets were collected in 100 µl of Nucleofector® solution (Lonza) and combined with plasmid DNA (2 µg). The cell/DNA solution was transferred to a cuvette, and the program was initiated (0.34kV, 960 microfarads). Medium (500 µl) was added immediately, and cells were gently transferred to 60-mm plates and allowed to differentiate. In some experiments Trans-IT 3T3™ (Mirus Bio LLC) transfection agent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3T3L1 preadipocytes were washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min. The cells were then rinsed and incubated with Oil Red O staining solution (Adipogenesis Assay kit, Millipore) and incubated for 15 min. After washing, images were captured with Nikon confocal microscope. For quantification, 250 µl of dye extraction solution was added and incubated for 30 min. Absorbance was read at 520 nm. The pSPL3 vector was modified to remove cryptic 5′ splice sites as described in our previous publication (10.Apostolatos H. Apostolatos A. Vickers T. Watson J.E. Song S. Vale F. Cooper D.R. Sanchez-Ramos J. Patel N.A. Vitamin A metabolite, all-trans-retinoic acid, mediates alternative splicing of protein kinase C δVIII (PKCδVIII) isoform via splicing factor SC35.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25987-25995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pSPL3 vector was digested with BamHI (in the MCS) and NheI. Primers to amplify genomic PKCδ from 3T3L1 cells flanked mouse PKCδ exon 9 (101 bp) and were designed to include the BclI site in the forward primer (in bold type below) and BcuI site in the reverse primers (in bold type). The forward primer was designed to amplify 49 bp of 3′ intronic sequence such that the product contained the branch point and 3′ splice site and the reverse primer included 123 bp of 5′ intronic sequence (splicing minigene A) or 34 bp of 5′ intronic sequence (minigene B). The primers were: forward primer 5′-TGGTGATCAAGGAATGAGACCTGGGAGACC-3′; reverse primer Minigene A 5′-AGAACTAGTTTTCAGTCTACATGACTCCC-3′; reverse primer Minigene B 5′-GATACTAGTAAAGAGATATGTGACCCAGC-3′. The products were verified by sequencing and ligated into the digested pSPL3 vector. The overhangs of the selected restriction enzymes hybridized, and this enabled cloning of the PCR product in the proper orientation. The resulting splicing minigenes were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Mutation was created at the TRA2B site on the splicing minigene A using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies # 200523-5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used to create the mutation were 5′-GGAATATACCAGGGATTTGAGCCTAAGCCAGAAGTCTCTGGGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACTCCCAGAGACTTCTGGCTTAGGCTCAAATCCCTGGTATATTCC-3′ (antisense). Mutation to the plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated minigene is referred to as pSPL3-PKCδ**T2b minigene. The RIP kit was purchased from Sigma, and the protocol was followed as per the manufacturer's instruction. Tra2β antibody was purchased from Sigma, SNRNP70 antibody was from Millipore, and IgG antibody was included in kit (Sigma). Cell lysate (10%) was removed for the input sample. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 µg of Tra2β antibody, SNRNP70 antibody (positive control), or IgG antibody (as the negative control). RNA was purified and treated with DNase to remove genomic DNA. SYBR Green real-time qPCR was performed as described above using PKCδ primer sets and primers for U1 RNA, the binding partner for the positive control SNRNP70. The primer sequences for U1 RNA are: forward 5′-TCCCAGGGCGAGGCTTATCCATT-3′ and reverse 5′-GAACGCAGTCCCCCACTACCACAAAT-3′. The yield (% input) and specificity (-fold enrichment) was calculated using Excel™ template for RIP from Sigma. The PCR gels for the splicing minigene assay and the Western blots were analyzed using AlphaView® software from ProteinSimple™. Experiments were repeated three to five times for reproducibility. PRISM™ software was used for statistical analysis. Two-way analysis of variance or matched Student's t test was used in the analysis. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We previously showed that expression levels of PKCδ splice variants PKCδI and PKCδII switched by day 4 of differentiation (2.Patel R. Apostolatos A. Carter G. Ajmo J. Gali M. Cooper D.R. You M. Bisht K.S. Patel N.A. Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) splice variants modulate apoptosis pathway in 3T3L1 cells during adipogenesis: identification of PKCδII inhibitor,.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 26834-26846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we sought to evaluate the role of PKCδI during adipogenesis. Using primers specific to PKCδI, our real time qPCR results (Fig. 1) indicate that PKCδI levels were high in preadipocytes and started declining after day 4 when the cells underwent terminal differentiation. Our results indicated that PKCδI levels were higher during 3T3L1 preadipocyte mitotic clonal expansion (0–48 h upon hormonal induction). To determine its role in cell cycle, we knocked down the expression using PRKCD siRNA (25 nm; transfected on day −1 or scrambled siRNA (25 nm), and cells were harvested 0–24 h of differentiation). Using SYBR Green real time qPCR, we showed PRKCD siRNA decreased PKCδI levels, whereas PKCδII levels remained unaffected. Using flow cytometry, we determined the percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase in 3T3L1 control (untreated), scrambled siRNA control, and PRKCD siRNA-transfected cells. Our results indicated that PRKCD siRNA decreased the percentage of cells in the G2M phase (Fig. 2). The cells transfected with scrambled siRNA did not differ significantly from the control (untreated) cells indicating that transfection of siRNA did not affect differentiation. This indicated an exit of the cell cycle with knockdown of PKCδI. Because our results indicated a role of PKCδI in preadipocyte differentiation, we transfected PRKCD siRNA along with its scrambled control as described above. Cells were differentiated to day 3. Formation of lipid droplets was evaluated with Oil Red O staining. Images were taken using a Nikon microscope, and the amount of Oil Red O staining was also quantified (see “Experimental Procedures”). Our results (Fig. 3, a and b) indicated that knockdown of PRKCD increased Oil Red O staining compared with control cells, indicating an increase in differentiation in the PRKCD siRNA cells. The cells transfected with scrambled siRNA did not differ significantly from the control (untreated) cells. To validate that a decrease in PKCδI levels promoted adipocyte differentiation, we analyzed PPARγ and adiponectin, the markers for adipocyte differentiation, in cells transfected with PRKCD siRNA as described above. Using Western blot analysis (Fig. 3c), our results indicated an increase in PPARγ1 and -2 and adiponectin along with a decrease in PKCδI levels. PKCδII levels were not affected by PRKCD siRNA. Although PKCδII is not significantly expressed during early differentiation process (0 to 72 h), as a control we transfected either PKCδII siRNA or PRKCD siRNA on day 0, and cells were analyzed by SYBR Green real time qPCR on day 3 as shown (Fig. 3d). Results showed no significant changes in PPARγ1/2 with PKCδII siRNA, whereas PRKCD siRNA results were in agreement with the protein levels. These results suggest that inhibition of PKCδI allowed the cells to exit the cell cycle and initiate terminal differentiation in 3T3L1 cells. Our previous study indicated that the expression patterns of the two alternatively spliced variants of PKCδ (PKCδI (via utilization of 5′ splice site I on exon 9) and PKCδII (via utilization of 5′ splice site II on exon 9)) are distinct in 3T3L1 cells. Alternative splicing is regulated by the interaction of trans-factors with the cis-elements on the pre-mRNA. To identify the splice factor involved in PKCδI splicing during early differentiation stage in preadipocytes, we used 16H3 antibody (Millipore). This widely used antibody by RNA biologists detects multiple SR proteins ranging from 20 to 75 kDa. Our results showed a protein at ∼35 kDa whose pattern corresponded to the expression of PKCδI, i.e. high expression on day 0 and then tapering down during the following days. Using specific antibodies, our results indicated that SFRS10 (also known as TRA2B/Tra2β) expression was high on day 0 followed by a gradual decline (Fig. 4a). SRSF1 (also known as SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (also known as SC35), whose molecular mass, is also around ∼35 kDa were also individually analyzed for their expression patterns in 3T3L1 cells, and data showed that the PKCδI levels expression did not concur with their expression patterns (data not shown). These results indicated that Tra2β expression was concurrent with PKCδI expression in 3T3L1 cells. Using computational analysis, we determined that the consensus binding sequence of Tra2β (17.Elliott D.J. Best A. Dalgliesh C. Ehrmann I. Grellscheid S. How does Tra2β protein regulate tissue-specific RNA splicing?.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2012; 40: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was present on PKCδI exon 9 (Fig. 4b). Because our results above indicated a potential role of TRA2B in PKCδI splicing, we sought to evaluate this further. We transfected TRA2B siRNA (Origene; 10 nm) on day −1 along with its scrambled control, and harvested the cells on day 2 of 3T3L1 in vitro differentiation. Our results (Fig. 5a) show a decrease of PKCδI levels with TRA2B siRNA, whereas PKCδII levels remain unchanged. We confirmed the results with SYBR Green qPCR (Fig. 5b). Next, we overexpressed TRA2B (2 µg) on day 6 when both PKCδI and TRA2B levels are lower in differentiating 3T3L1 cells and analyzed cells on day 8. Our results (Fig. 5c) indicated an increase in PKCδI levels with overexpression of TRA2B. These results demonstrate that TRA2B mediated PKCδI splicing. Splicing minigenes are advantageous to study alternative splicing events without the influence of endogenous factors. Hence to evaluate the role of TRA2B in PKCδI alternative splicing, we cloned heterologous splicing minigenes which contained PKCδI exon 9 and its flanking 3′ and 5′ sequences cloned into a splicing vector pSPL3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The splicing minigene A contained the alternative 5′ splice site II, whereas splicing minigene B was trimmed to contain minimum 5′ flanking sequences without additional 5′ splice sites. Splicing minigenes A or B or pSPL3 vector was transiently transfected on day 0. 3T3L1 cells were differentiated for 48 h. RNA was isolated and RT-PCR performed using primers for SD (splice donor exon of pSPL3) and SA (splice acceptor exon of pSPL3). Our results show (Fig. 6) PKCδI exon inclusion via utilization of 5′ splice site I in the splicing minigenes A and B in 3T3L1 cells. The 5′ splice site II was not utilized at this stage of differentiation in 3T3 preadipocytes. Our computational analysis of PKCδ exon 9 showed the presence of a TRA2B consensus binding sequence gagaagaa. To determine whether Tra2β bound to the cis-element to promote PKCδI splicing, we mutated this TRA2B sequence within the PKCδ splicing minigene A (referred to as pSPL3-PKCδ**T2B splicing minigene; schematic in Fig. 7a). 3T3L1 cells were transfected on day 0 with either splicing minigene A or mutated pSPL3-PKCδ**T2B splicing minigene along with Tra2β (2 µg). Cells were then differentiated for 24 h. This enabled quantification of the response of Tra2β on PKCδ exon 9 inclusion as 48 h differentiation in Fig. 6 resulted in maximum PKCδI inclusion. RNA was collected, and PKCδI exon inclusion was evaluated by PCR using SD-SA primers. Our results (Fig. 7b) indicated that Tra2β increased PKCδI exon 9 inclusion using 5′ splice site I in the splicing minigene A and that mutation of TRA2B sequence inhibited inclusion of PKCδI exon9. This demonstrates that TRA2B mediated splicing of PKCδI mRNA. To establish that Tra2β bound to PKCδ mRNA, we performed RIP. The RIP assay involves immunoprecipitation of complexes formed endogenously between the RNA-binding proteins along with the associated RNA in vivo. 3T3L1 cells were collected on day 0 when they were 100% confluent. The complex was cross-linked in vivo using formaldehyde. Tra2β antibody was used to immunoprecipitate the complex. A negative control (mock IgG IP) or positive control (SNRNP70 IP) for RIP assay was included in the experiments. Supernatant (50 µl) after the last wash was aliquoted for use in a Western blot to confirm IP. The cross-linking was reversed and extracted RNA from the RIP was then used in qPCR. For positive control, qPCR was performed using U1 RNA primers, the binding partner for SNRNP70. Our results (Fig. 8) showed enrichment of PKCδI with Tra2β RIP. PKCδ has roles in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. The role of PKCδI splice variant in apoptosis was previously shown by us (9.Patel N.A. Song S.S. Cooper D.R. PKCδ alternatively spliced isoforms modulate cellular apoptosis in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of human NT2 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells.Gene Exp. 2006; 13: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and others (18.Carvour M.

Brain. 2008; 1: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here we evaluated the role of PKCδI during early stages (0–48 h) of 3T3L1 differentiation. PKCδI is the predominant splice variant present in 3T3L1 preadipocytes; PKCδII is not expressed significantly in the early stages of differentiation. Studies have pointed to the role of PKCδ in cell cycle. In adipocytes, these were limited to day 0 compared with day 8 (20.Zhou Y. Wang D. Li F. Shi J. Song J. Different roles of protein kinase C-βI and -δ in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 2151-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To our knowledge no study was undertaken to delineate the roles and mechanism of expression of PKCδI splice variant during early stages of 3T3L1 differentiation. PKCδ can be both stimulatory and inhibitory in the cell cycle. PKC effects on cell cycle are generally mediated by downstream signaling cascades such as PI3K/Akt, Erk, or Wnt pathway. PKCδ affects activity of cyclin-dependent kinases as well as cyclin D1, cyclin E, or cyclin A and promotes phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (21.Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M.

Here we showed that down-regulation of PKCδI during 3T3L1 adipogenesis was required for differentiation to adipocytes. The 3T3L1 cells undergo mitotic clonal expansion, which is supported by high levels of PKCδI and exit from the cell cycle to initiate differentiation is regulated by PKCδI. Further in-depth analysis would be required to identify the specific cyclin or cyclin-dependent kinases and their phosphorylation cascades as well as cross-talk that mediates this effect of PKCδI in 3T3L1 cells. Alternative splicing of PRKCD gene produces the splice variants PKCδI and PKCδII in 3T3L1 cells. During adipogenesis, the expression pattern of these PKCδ splice variants is distinct. PKCδI is present in preadipocytes, and its expression slowly declines after differentiation, whereas PKCδII expression increases after terminal differentiation. Alternative splicing is an essential mode for protein diversity and gives the ability to adjust to the constantly changing proteomic needs of the cell in response to development, hormones, and other stimuli. These changes are often a result of the dynamic association of the splice factors with pre-mRNA of the target gene. Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which has >200 components including small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and proteins. Protein factors that function as enhancers and suppressors of splicing are an integral part of the spliceosome (27.Bourgeois C.F. Lejeune F. Stévenin J. Broad specificity of SR (serine/arginine) proteins in the regulation of alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA.Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 37-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In 3T3L1 cells, TRA2B mediates the splicing of PKCδI mRNA by binding to its cis-element on PKCδI exon 9. This site is close to the 5′ splice site, and binding of Tra2β promotes the binding of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein to the 5′ splice site thereby initiating the splicing reaction. Because several endogenous factors could potentially affect PKCδI splicing, we also used a heterologous splicing minigene to validate the role of TRA2B in promoting PKCδI splicing during 3T3L1 adipogenesis. The 5′ splice site II was not utilized upon TRA2B mutation in the minigene, which suggests that utilization of the downstream splice site required splice factors that may be absent during 0–24 h of differentiation of 3T3L1 preadipocytes. Our studies point to the role of TRA2B in cell cycle progression. It is possible that TRA2B affects splicing of other genes involved in the cell cycle; however, this remains to be elucidated. Regulation of alternative splicing by TRA2B is shown in several systems including LIPN1 in liver (28.Pihlajamäki J. Lerin C. Itkonen P. Boes T. Floss T. Schroeder J. Dearie F. Crunkhorn S. Burak F.

Our previous study demonstrated dysregulated PKCδ alternative splicing in obese adipocytes (1.Carter G. Apostolatos A. Patel R. Mathur A. Cooper D. Murr M. Patel N.A. Dysregulated alternative splicing pattern of PKC during differentiation of human preadipocytes represents distinct differences between lean and obese adipocytes.ISRN Obes. 2013; 2013: 161345PubMed Google Scholar) compared with lean. Furthermore, the adipogenesis program was also dysregulated in obese subjects. Hence, understanding the regulation of expression of PKCδI by splice factor TRA2B during adipogenesis is important to the study of obesity pathology.

https://openalex.org/W2055342217,"Effective host defence against viruses depends on the rapid triggering of innate immunity through the induction of a type I interferon (IFN) response. To this end, microbe-associated molecular patterns are detected by dedicated receptors. Among them, the RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5 activate IFN gene expression upon sensing viral RNA in the cytoplasm. While MDA5 forms long filaments in vitro upon activation, RIG-I is believed to oligomerize after RNA binding in order to transduce a signal. Here, we show that in vitro binding of synthetic RNA mimicking that of Mononegavirales (Ebola, rabies and measles viruses) leader sequences to purified RIG-I does not induce RIG-I oligomerization. Furthermore, in cells devoid of endogenous functional RIG-I-like receptors, after activation of exogenous Flag-RIG-I by a 62-mer-5′ppp-dsRNA or by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a dsRNA analogue, or by measles virus infection, anti-Flag immunoprecipitation and specific elution with Flag peptide indicated a monomeric form of RIG-I. Accordingly, when using the Gaussia Luciferase-Based Protein Complementation Assay (PCA), a more sensitive in cellula assay, no RIG-I oligomerization could be detected upon RNA stimulation. Altogether our data indicate that the need for self-oligomerization of RIG-I for signal transduction is either dispensable or very transient."
https://openalex.org/W1964597525,"Saturation mutagenesis is a cornerstone technique in protein engineering because of its utility (in conjunction with appropriate analytical techniques) for assessing effects of varying residues at selected positions on proteins' structures and functions. Site-directed mutagenesis with degenerate primers is the simplest and most rapid saturation mutagenesis technique. Thus, it is highly appropriate for assessing whether or not variation at certain sites is permissible, but not necessarily the most time- and cost-effective technique for detailed assessment of variations' effects. Thus, in the presented study we applied the technique to randomize position W373 in β-glucosidase Zm-p60.1, which is highly conserved among β-glucosidases. Unexpectedly, β-glucosidase activity screening of the generated variants showed that most variants were active, although they generally had significantly lower activity than the wild type enzyme. Further characterization of the library led us to conclude that a carefully selected combination of randomized codon-based saturation mutagenesis and site-directed mutagenesis may be most efficient, particularly when constructing and investigating randomized libraries with high fractions of positive hits."
