https://openalex.org/W2020555116,"It has previously been shown that retinoic acid induces multiple phenotypic changes in cultures of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells. In this paper we demonstrate that these retinoid-generated cells can be converted to yet another cell type by compounds that elevate cAMP concentrations. The phenotype of the new cell type is characterized by the synthesis of plasminogen activator, laminin and type IV collagen, and by very low levels of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. The secretion of plasminogen activator and type IV collagen, and low levels of alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase, have been previously shown to be properties of parietal endoderm, an extraembryonic cell which is generated early in mouse embryonesis. We show here that parietal endoderm also synthesizes laminin. The cell type generated by retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP treatment is therefore indistinguishable from definitive parietal endoderm. Analysis of the final phenotype indicates that it is not dependent upon the continued presence of either compound, and that cAMP agents are active only on cells that have been treated with retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1991736636,"The effects of a vitamin D deficiency on insulin and glucagon release was determined in the isolated perfused rat pancreas by radioimmunoassay of the secreted proteins. During a 30-minute period of perfusion with glucose and arginine, pancreases from vitamin D-deficient rats exhibited a 48 percent reduction in insulin secretion compared to that for pancreases from vitamin D-deficient rats that had been replenished with vitamin D. Vitamin D status had no effect on pancreatic glucagon secretion. This result, along with the previously demonstrated presence in the pancreas of a vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein and cytosol receptor for the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, indicates an important role for vitamin D in the endocrine functioning of the pancreas."

https://openalex.org/W1980184916,"We have identified a new class of SV40 replicative intermediates which consists of a least 20 discrete DNA species. All members of this class are catenated dimers, two circular molecules of SV40 duplex DNA linked topologically by one or more intertwining events. Most of these molecules are linked by several intertwining events, and the range of linkage states observed runs from L = 1 to L = 10. A catenated dimer with a given linkage state is assigned to one of three distinct families (A, B or C) depending on the open or covalently closed nature of its two circular components: in form A catenated dimers, both circles are nicked or gapped; in form B, one of the circles is supercoiled; and in form C, both circles are supercoiled. Members of all three of these families are found in SV40 chromatin pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine, and together they comprise 10-20% of the total replicative form SV40 DNA, appearing as a discrete series of electrophoretically resolved bands superimposed upon a continuous smear of growing cairns structures. The distribution of linkage states varies between the families, A being the most intertwined and C the least intertwined. Upon a chase with cold thymidine, label is lost rapidly from all these catenated DNA species. We suggest that the sequence A leads to B leads to C leads to mature monomeric supercoiled SV40 DNA represents the final stages of SV40 replication, and that a special enzyme activity exists in vivo to uncatenate the SV40 daughter chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2017580487,"The his4-912 mutation results from insertion of a 6200 bp transposable element into the his4 gene of yeast. In order to clone the his4-912 mutation, the plasmid pBR322 was integrated into the his4 gene by means of yeast transformation, and then the vector sequences and the his4-912 insertion element were excised as a single restriction fragment. This his 4-912 insertion element is homologous to Ty1, a family of repetitive yeast DNA sequences. His+ revertants derived from the his4-912 mutant carry a number of chromosomal aberrations including deletions, translocations, a transposition and an inversion. The majority of His+ revertants result from deletions which have both endpoints within the element and which leave behind only 300 bp of the insertion element. Other derivatives of the his4-912 mutant carry deletions which have one endpoint in the insertion element and one endpoint in the his4 coding sequence. In two His+ revertants carrying reciprocal translocations, the chromosome III translocation breakpoints occur within the his4-912 insertion element. A His+ revertant carrying an inversion of most of the left arm of chromosome III may be an intermediate in transposition of the his4-912 insertion element to a new site on chromosome III."
https://openalex.org/W2057897402,"Extracts of Drosophila embryos contain an enzymatic activity that converts circular DNAs into huge networks of catenated rings in an ATP-dependent fashion. The catenated activity is resolved into two protein components during purification. One component is a novel DNA topoisomerase that requires the presence of ATP in order to relax supercoiled DNA. We have shown that the ATP-dependent DNA topoisomerase relaxes DNA by a mechanism distinct from that of nicking-closing enzymes. The Drosophila ATP-dependent topoisomerase allows one segment of a circular DNA to pass through transient breaks in both strands at another site on the DNA circle without any relative rotation between the ends at the transient break. This mechanism can convert negative supertwists to positive twists and vice versa until a relaxed equilibrium state is reached. The formation of catenated rings is mediated by an analogous bimolecular reaction which can occur between two nonhomologous DNA circles. The catenation reaction is fully reversible: in the presence of the second protein component, circular DNA is converted quantitatively into catenated forms; in its absence, the ATP-dependent topoisomerase resolves catenated networks back into monomer circles. The Drosophila ATP-dependent topoisomerase appears to be closely related to E. coli DNA gyrase in that both use a similar mechanism to change the topology of DNA, both require ATP and both are inhibited by the antibiotic novobiocin. The presence of an enzyme that allows one DNA helix to pass freely through another could not only be useful in relaxation of topological constraints, but also may be involved in the folding and unfolding of eucaryotic chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2002747090,"The interaction of endogenous opiates and stress-induced eating in rats was evaluated by pharmacological manipulation. Eating induced by the tail-pinch method was inhibited by the opitate antagonist naloxone; after being repeatedly stressed over a 10-day period and then given nalozone, the rats behaved in a manner indistinguishable from the ""wet-dog"" shakes of opiate withdrawal. Thus endogenous opiates may have a role in the control of stress-related eating, a finding that may have therapeutic implications for humans."
https://openalex.org/W2092486725,The binding of [6-alanine]gonadotropin-releasing hormone to pituitary plasma membranes increased threefold between metestrus and early proestrus in female rats. Receptor numbers fell rapidly on the afternoon of proestrus coincident with the preovulatory gonadotropin surge. The numbers of receptors for gonadotropin-releasing hormone were positively correlated with concentrations of estradiol in serum; this pattern may be a necessary component of increased pituitary sensitivty to gonadotropin-releasing hormone observed during proestrus.

https://openalex.org/W2027943432,"Maturation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G) to the cell surface is blocked at the nonpermissive temperature in cells infected with temperature-sensitive mutants in the structural gene encoding for G. We show here that these mutants fall into two discrete classes with respect to the stage of post-translational processing at which the block occurs. In all cases the mutant glycoproteins are inserted normally into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, receive the two-high-mannose oligosaccharides, and apparently lose the NH2-terminal signal sequence of 16 amino acids. In cells infected with one class of mutants, no further processing of the glycoprotein occurs, and we conclude that the mutant protein is blocked at a pre-Golgi stage. In cells infected with ts L511(V), however, addition of the terminal sugars galactose and sialic acid occurs normally. Thus the maturation of G proceeds through several Golgi functions but is blocked before its appearance on the cell surface. The oligosaccharide chain of ts L511(V) G, accumulated at either the permissive (where surface maturation occurs) or the nonpermissive temperature, lacks one saccharide residue, probably fucose. In addition, no fatty acid residues are added to the ts L511(V) G protein at the nonpermissive temperature, although addition does occur under permissive conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1501758717,"We report the purification of acetylcholine receptors with active agonist-regulated cation channels from Torpedo californica electric organ tissue by five methods. In one method, previously used by others, contaminating proteins were removed from partially purified membranes by alkaline extraction, preserving membrane integrity throughout the procedure. In the other four methods, acetylcholine receptors were purified after solubalization with sodium cholate. The continual presence of soybean lipid in mixed micelles with cholate was required to prevent irreversible inactivation of the cation channel. Solubilized receptors were purified by affinity chromatography using either Naga naja siamensis toxin III or concanavalin A coupled to agarose. Sucrose gradient centrifugation was also used to purify solubilized receptors. The best method combined affinity chromatography on toxin-agarose and concanavalin A agarose. Receptors purified by all five methods were incorporated into soybean lipid vesicles by the cholate dialysis technique. The agonist-regulated cation channels of the receptors were equally active after reconstitution, independent of the method used for purification. All reconstituted vesicle preparations were similar in preferential orientation of acetylcholine receptor toward the external surface, dose-response to carbamylcholine, carbamylcholine-induced desensitization, and carbamycholine-induced influx of 22Na+ per mol of receptor. Carbamylcholine-induced 22Na+ influx/receptor was greater after reconstitution than in native vesicles. This was because, in native vesicles, carbamylcholine-induced 22Na+ influx was limited by equilibration of the internal volume of the vesicles with the external 22Na+ concentration, whereas in reconstituted vesicles 22Na+ influx was limited by desensitization of the receptor molecule. We demonstrate that only one of the two toxin binding sites on the receptor monomer, the one which can be affinity alkylated with 4-(N-maleimido)benzyltrimethylammonium, controls the carbamylcholine-induced opening of the cation channel."
https://openalex.org/W2000475723,"Clones containing five non-adult beta-globin genes were isolated from a library of BALB/c DNA. Together, the newly cloned regions comprise a contiguous block of 32 kb of the mouse genome. Restriction mapping of genomic DNA established the physical linkage of these non-adult genes to the two adult beta-globin genes as well as the two adult genes to each other. Thus this entire BALB/c beta-globin complex consists of seven linked genes, all with the same transcriptional orientation, arrayed over 70 kb of DNA. The order of these genes is: 5'-epsilon y3-beta h0-beta h1-beta h2-beta h3-beta major-beta minor-3' Portions of each of the five newly identified genes have been sequenced. Only one, epsilon y3, encodes a previously described globin. beta h0 and beta h1, which are closely related, differ significantly from both adult and embryonic globins. The beta h2 sequence is more closely related to the adult genes than to the other non-adult genes. However, it is the sequence least homologous to both of these classes. The 5' half of the beta h3 gene (preceding codon 75) has an aberrant structure. The rest of this sequence is intact, resembling an adult beta-globin gene except for an inserted base at cocon 90, resulting in a frameshift. Consequently, the beta h3 sequence cannot be translated to produce a normal beta-globin."
https://openalex.org/W2048650995,"To examine the details of insertion for the D. malanogaster transposable element copia, we have isolated three independent pairs of genomic fragments which correspond to occupied and unoccupied target sites for insertion. Restriction endonuclease analysis suggests that sites with and without an element differ by a simple 5000 bp insertion. Direct DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that a 5 bp sequence, present once in the target DNA at the site of insertion, is found on both sides of the element after insertion. The 5 bp sequences which are duplicated are different in each case. Moreover, there does not appear to be any sequence homology among these three independent insertion sites"
https://openalex.org/W2085600928,"A bacterial plasmid carrying the early region of SV40 (pOT) has been stably established in high molecular weight (hmw) DNA of mouse L cells by selection for the herpes virus thymidine kinase (tk) gene. DNA blotting has demonstrated that most cell lines contain multiple discrete copies of pOT, generally with an intact SV40 early region. No free copies of pOT have been detected. Both pOT and tk sequences may be amplified up to 20-200 copies of the SV40 early region. In contrast to the uniform staining pattern normally observed in SV40-transformed lines, indirect immunofluorescence using antiserum to the SV40 T antigen has demonstrated that the expression of the early region is heterogeneous in these cell lines. This fraction expressing T is characteristic of a given cell line, and varies from 0 to 99% positive. Several pOT cell lines have been fused to simian cells, and replicating low molecular weight DNAs were isolated from the heterokaryons. Transformation of E. coli with this DNA demonstrates that pOT can be rescued from hmw DNA in L cells and reestablished as a plasmid in E. coli. Excision is generally precise when pOT is introduced to the murine cells as supercoiled molecule, and imprecise when pOT is introduced in linear form."

https://openalex.org/W1969836072,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the terminal regions of two members of the copia sequence family of D. melanogaster. The first 276 bp at one end of a copia element are repeated in direct orientation at its other end. The direct repeats on a single copia element are identical to each other, but they differ by two nucleotide substitutions between the two elements which were examined; this suggests that during transposition only one direct repeat of the parent element is used as a template for both direct repeats of the transposed element. Each direct repeat itself contains a 17 bp imperfectly matched inverted terminal repetition. The ends of copia show significant sequence homology both to the yeast Ty1 element and to the integrated provirus of avian spleen necrosis virus, two other eucaryotic elements known to insert at many different chromosomal locations. Analysis of the genomic organization of the direct repeat sequence demonstrates that it seldom, if ever, occurs unlinked to an entire copia element."

https://openalex.org/W1995090181,"The his4-912 mutation shares similar genetic properties with mutations promoted by procaryotic insertion elements. This mutation lacks all three his4 functions. Many different classes of His+ revertants have been obtained from his4-912. The most frequent class of His+ revertants results from a site mutation which confers a cold-sensitive His- phenotype. Other classes of revertants contain translocations (one between chromosomes I and III and the other between chromosomes III and XII), a transposition of the his4 region to chromosome VIII, and an inversion of most of the left arm of chromosome III. Another class contains deletions which extend from his4-912 into the his4 region. In each of these classes of revertants, the his4 region is closely linked to the chromosomal aberration. Many of these revertants contain additional changes in chromosome structure (duplication, deletion and aneuploidy) that are unrelated to the reversion of his4-912 to His4+."
https://openalex.org/W1980035715,"A tandemly repeated sequence within the genome of vaccinia virus is cut to fragments of approximately 70 bp by Hinf I, Taq I or Mbo II. The 70 bp repetition was localized within the much larger (10,300 bp) inverted terminal repetition by restriction analysis of cloned DNA fragments and by hybridization of the purified 70 bp repeat to vaccinia virus DNA restriction fragments. The molar abundance of the 70 bp fragment corresponds to a 30 fold repetition at each end of the genome. The repeating restriction endonuclease sites were mapped by agarose gel electrophoresis of partial Hinf I digests of the terminally labeled cloned DNA fragment. The first of 13 repetitive Hinf I sites occurred approximately 150 bp from the end of the cloned DNA. After an intervening sequence of approximately 435 bp, a second series of 17 repetitive Hinf I sites occurred. The DNA between the two blocks of repetitions has a unique sequence containing single Dde I, Alu I and Sau 3A sites. Tandem repeats within the inverted terminal repetition could serve to accelerate self-annealing of single strands of DNA to form circular structures during replication."
https://openalex.org/W2052400179,"Seven recombinant DNA clones containing mouse intracisternal A particle genes were isolated and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion, Southern blot analysis and heteroduplex mapping. The sequence organization of the individual genes was found to differ, with one end of the gene region being most variable, while a central segment of 1.8 kb was missing from two of the clones. A third region, common to all the clones and containing the 3' end of the gene, is present in about 1800 copies per haploid genome, but the central portion is found in only 650 copies. The same reiteration frequency is found in both myeloma tumor and mouse liver DNA. The most abundant intracisternal A particle RNA in two different myeloma lines was found to be 3.5 kb, and RNA/DNA hybrids show that the RNA is homologous to all but a small internal segment of one of the clones."
https://openalex.org/W1606650924,"A cAMP-independent glycogen synthase kinase has been purified from rabbit liver. This kinase is completely dependent on the presence of calmodulin and Ca2+ for activity. Half-maximal activation required about 0.1 microM calmodulin. Complete inhibition was obtained in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid or trifluoperazine. This calmodulin-dependent synthase kinase does not phosphorylate phosphorylase, myosin light chain, casein, or histone. It rapidly incorporates 0.4 to 0.5 mol of 32P/mol of synthase subunit into the NH2-terminal domain, resulting in partial inactivation of glycogen synthase. These results indicate the existence of a calmodulin-dependent kinase which may be specific for glycogen synthase."

https://openalex.org/W2046248771,"In addition to the five mRNA species and 47 nucleotide long leader RNA synthesized by purified virions of vesicular stomatitis virus, at least three discrete low molecular weight RNA species having approximate chain lengths of 28, 42 and 70 nucleotides can be detected in vitro. Each of these RNA species displays a unique and characteristic T1 fingerprint profile and contains (p)ppAA as its 5' terminus. By partial sequence analyses, two of the small RNA products, 42 and 28 bases long, were found to contain 5' terminal sequences identical to those in the N and NS mRNAs, respectively. Ultraviolet inactivation studies demonstrate that each of these RNA species has a target size in agreement with its molecular weight indicating independent initiation. Kinetic studies show that the small RNA species are synthesized within 1 min, while mRNA chain completion occurs later in the sequential order N-NS-M-G. These results indicate that viral mRNA synthesis occurs in vitro by multiple initiations at different promoter sites on the genome RNA, and that the elongation and completion of the individual mRNAs depend on prior transcription of 3' proximal genes. We present a model for viral mRNA synthesis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2078868081,"The oligosaccharide-lipid which is the precursor of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of eucaryotic glycoproteins is synthesized from sugar nucleotides in the endoplasmic reticulum. The transmembrane location of the assembly of this oligosaccharide-lipid has been studied in vitro in rat liver microsomes. Protease treatment of these sealed vesicles which are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum resulted in the inactivation of a number of enzymes of oligosaccharide-lipid synthesis. Three early steps, the synthesis of dolichol--phosphate--mannose, of dolichol--phosphate--glucose and of dolichol--pyrophosphoryl--di--N--acetylchitobiose, as well as the final steps, the addition of glucose residues to oligosaccharide-lipid, were inactivated under conditions where only the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was accessible to protease. This finding, and the fact that no activities were latent to protease in intact microsomal vesicles, suggest that oligosaccharide-lipid is assembled on the cytoplasmic side of the microsomal membrane. However, the possibility of enzymes spanning the bilayer with their active sites facing the lumen cannot be ruled out. These results are discussed in relation to the segregation of newly made glycoprotein products within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1489265248,"Cytochrome P-450scc from bovine adrenal cortex mitochondria was purified and reconstituted into phosphatidylcholine vesicles which varied in both cholesterol content and in the fatty acyl composition of the phospholipid. Under conditions of optimal ionic strength, pH, and excess adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, it was found that at a constant cholesterol: phospholipid ratio, the membrane composition had large effects on the rate of hemoprotein-catalyzed side chain cleavage of cholesterol. Rate effects were due to phospholipid-induced changes in the enzyme's Km for cholesterol, and not due to Vmax effects. Binding of cholesterol to cytochrome P-450 could also be monitored optically by measuring the fraction of enzyme in the high spin form. Dissociation constants determined in this manner for cholesterol binding in phospholipid of differing fatty acyl composition showed an excellent inverse correlation with the rates of pregnenolone formation in the same lipids (at constant cholesterol concentration) (see Fig. 6); thus, phospholipid exerts its rate effects by modulating the binding of cholesterol to the cytochrome. The membrane-mediated effects on spin state and activity mimic closely the effects seen in mitochondria isolated from adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated versus control adrenal cells. This behavior suggests to us that acute steroidogenic action of adrenocorticotropic hormone may be mediated through changes in the composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane in which cytochrome P-45scc is embedded."

https://openalex.org/W2116297146,"We describe the isolation of two recombinant λ phages, each containing genomic DNA fragments encoding both the major adult α- and β-globin mRNAs of X. laevis. The DNA fragments in the two clones have restriction maps which indicate that they are each derived from a different member of the pair of alleles present in the heterozygote used as the source of DNA for cloning. The characterization of these two clones by restriction mapping, R looping and DNA sequencing shows that the α1- and β1-globin genes lie in the same orientation separated by 7.7 kb of DNA. There are two introns in the α1-globin gene and two in the β1-globin gene, and they interrupt the genes at exactly the same positions as the introns found in all known mammalian α- and β-globin genes. The exon sequences proximal to the introns show a much higher degree of homology with mammalian sequences than the sequences distal to intron/exon junctions, and the introns in the β1-globin gene of X. laevis are very similar in length to the corresponding introns in the β-globin genes of several mammals and the chicken."

https://openalex.org/W2094145962,"We have introduced adenovirus 2 genes into high molecular weight DNA of permissive human cells by co-transformation of tk- human 143 cells with Ad2 restriction enzyme fragments and a cloned Bam HI fragment that carries the HSV-1 thymidine kinase gene. Tk+ cells were isolated after selection and maintenance in HAT medium. Several co-transformed lines are able to complement the growth of Ad5 dl312 (delta 1.2--3.7) and Ad5 dl434 (delta 2.6--8.7), deletion mutants that lack sequences from the left end of the viral genome. The amount and arrangement of viral sequences in the co-transformed cell lines have been analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion and filter hybridization. Most of the cell lines contain a single insertion of the HSV-1 tk fragment and a single insert of adenoviral DNA. However, one line (B1) contains at least four different insertions, two of which are present in multiple copies. The adenoviral DNA in all cell lines is composed of sequences from the left end of the genome and extends for varying lengths in different lines. Two cell lines that complement deletion mutants efficiently synthesize both early region 1a and 1b mRNAs. The B1 line synthesizes low levels of 1a mRNA, higher levels of 1b mRNA and a unique mRNA that maps to the right of the 1b gene family. When grown continuously in HAT medium, some cell lines are quite stable while others are fairly unstable. Some tk+ subclones support the growth of viral mutants as well as the parental line while others give reduced levels of complementation. For all tk+ subclones examined, the alteration or reduction in viral gene expression is independent of changes in the pattern of integration of viral DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2240370258,"Steroid hormone receptors contain a reactive sulfhydryl group (or groups) required for hormone binding. In the present study, the effects of several sulfhydryl-blocking reagents on hormone binding to aporeceptors and hormone x receptor complexes were compared, with the use of preparations of chick oviduct progesterone receptor and intestinal vitamin D receptor. N-Ethylmaleimide inhibited hormone binding to aporeceptors, whereas prior hormone binding protected against inactivation. In contrast, the mercurial reagent mersalyl both inhibited hormone binding to aporeceptors and dissociated hormone x receptor complexes. Complete dissociation of these complexes was achieved within 20 to 30 min at 0 degrees C. This process was a pseudo-first order reaction with a t 1/2 much less than the t 1/2 for hormone dissociation for either receptor at 0 degrees C. Hormone displacement was a general property of mercurial reagents; several organic mercurials as well as HgCl2 were effective. In contrast, sulfhydryl-alkylating agents (maleimides, iodoacetamide) and the disulfide 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) were ineffective in displacing bound hormone from either progesterone or vitamin D receptors. Finally, hormone displacement by mersalyl was reversible; addition of excess thiol reagent displaced the bound mersalyl and regenerated hormone binding activity in good yield. This result suggests that mercurial reagents should prove useful in further study of steroid hormone receptors, for example in elution of receptors from steroid-affinity adsorbents."

It maps within the 3' terminal segment of the viral genome that encodes the precursor polypeptide NCVP1b for the virus-specific RNA polymerase NCVP4."
https://openalex.org/W1993663780,"We have constructed well defined oligomeric molecules of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA as probes for investigating mechanisms by which cultured somatic cells recombine DNA. Restriction enzyme fragments from different temperature-sensitive mutants were joined in a head-to-tail orientation to create partial dimers 1.84 genome lengths in size. These molecules are too large to fit into a viral capsid. Therefore an assay that depends on production of progeny virus after infection with oligomeric DNA is a selective measure of precise conversion of oligomers to monomers. By constructing oligomers from appropriate combinations of temperature-sensitive DNAs, we have been able to study the conversion process in several defined regions of the SV40 genome. Our results indicate that conversion of oligomers to monomers occurs uniformly throughout the genome and is not dependent on normal viral DNA replication. These data indicate that conversion occurs primarily by general, homology-dependent recombination. At least one secondary mechanism that generates a low level of wild-type progeny was also detected. Studies with heteroduplex molecules indicate that repair of mismatched bases may be the secondary mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2090182960,"We have determined the DNA sequence of a cloned cluster of essentially identical glutamate tRNA genes of D. melanogaster.

The genes are all arranged with the same polarity, do not encode the tRNA CCA end and contain no intervening sequences. Examination of the 5' and 3' sequences immediately flanking each gene reveals a striking pattern of sequence homologies between certain of the genes, which suggests a possible evolutionary history of this gene cluster. We propose that two ancestral genes each gave rise to gene doublets by duplication, while one of these gene pairs then gave rise, in turn, to a trio of genes as a result of unequal crossover."

The deoxyadenosin/deoxycytidine kinase is purified 950-fold employing blue Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The two deoxyribonucleoside kinase activities copurify and are present in the same band after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight is determined by gel filtration to be 47,000. Cytidine, adenosine, arabinosylcytosine, and arabinosyladenine are substrates for the enzyme. The activities toward these substrates are less than 20% of the activities obtained with deoxyadenosin and deoxycytidine. The deoxycytidine and deoxyadenosine saturation curves are hyperbolic with Km values for both nucleosides around 5 microM. The maximal velocities for the two deoxyribonucleosides are nearly identical with GTP as phosphate donor. GTP is the best donor showing hyperbolic saturation curves and Km values around 150 microM depending on the deoxyribonucleoside concentration. dATP and dCTP are inhibitors when GTP is the phosphate donor. They may both act as phosphate donors themselves. A divalent metal ion is required, Mg2+ giving the highest activity. A spontaneous mutant, selected as resistant to 5-fluorodeoxycytidine, lacks both deoxycytidine and deoxyadenosine kinase activity, while it retains normal activities toward deoxyguanosine, deoxyuridine, and thymidine."
https://openalex.org/W1547283546,"Abstract Thyropin binding to high affinity receptors on human and porcine membranes was studied at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C, in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% albumin. By preincubating the membranes in high salt concentration before binding studies, the number of high affinity receptors could be increased 4- to 8-fold. The salt-induced exposure of high affinity TSH receptors was pH- and temperature-dependent and was maximal at pH 5.0, 37 degrees C in the presence of 1 M (NH4)2SO4. Other salts tested, including NaCl, HN4Cl, and Na2SO4, were also able to increase high affinity THS binding. The receptors exposed by salt were indistinguishable from those present on the membranes before such treatment. They had an affinity constant of 0.5 to 1 X 10(10 M-1, and a high TSH specificity with no inhibition of 125I-TSH binding in the presence of a thousandfold excess of gamma-globulin, thyroglobulin, corticotropin, cholera toxin, and gangliosides. Thyrotropin binding to low affinity TSH binding sites (affinity constant 1 to 3 X 10(7) M-1) measured at pH 6.0, 4 degrees C in 10 mM Tris/acetate, 0.1% albumin was unaltered by pre-exposure of membranes to high salt concentrations. These receptors had low TSH specificity and binding was inhibited by gamma-globulin, thyroglobulin, cholera toxin, and gangliosides. The salt-induced selective exposure of high affinity receptors with unaltered number of low affinity sites is further support for the existence of two separate TSH binding sites on thyroid membranes."

Previous observations that halothane anesthesia plus hind-limb amputation increases the number of metastases were confirmed. Amputation under the analgesia of electrical stimulation of the midbrain was found to increase metastatic activity. However, the stimulus-produced analgesia alone also increased the number of metastases. Systemically administered naloxone blocked the analgesic effect of midbrain stimulation but did not block the increase in the number of pulmonary metastases."
https://openalex.org/W1975778114,"Multiple forms of protein kinase inhibitor exist in mammalian testis. Specific antibodies to testicular protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) have been raised in sheep. The antibody to the smallest of the inhibitors (9300 daltons) has been purified by antigen-affinity chromatography and shown to give a precipitin band with the inhibitor by double immunodiffusion. The antibody does not recognize any of the subunits of cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, namely cGMP-dependent protein kinase or the catalytic or regulatory subunits from type I or type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases. The biological activity of the 9300 dalton PKI is blocked completely by a 5 fold molar excess of antibody. Furthermore, the antibody can also block the activity of all other forms of testicular PKI. Using the antibody in indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, PKI localization was examined during interphase and mitosis in a variety of cell types. Our observations indicate that PKI is localized on microtubules in the cytoplasmic microtubule complex during interphase and in the spindle apparatus during mitosis. We suggest that PKI may play a role in the cAMP-dependent regulation of microtubule structure and/or function."
https://openalex.org/W1982620309,"Specific binding of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) was found in nuclear and cytosol fractions of the bovine pituitary. For nuclear binding. the dissociation constant was 0.1 namomole per liter, and maximum binding was 104 femtomoles per milligram of protein. In competition studies, 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) was 300 times weaker than 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3). The existence of high-affinity sites supports a physiologic role for 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) in the pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W2262165105,"The effect of 8-bromo cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) on sugar and amino acid transport was investigated in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in mutants selected for resistance to cAMP inhibition of cell growth. In wild type cells, both 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport were decreased in cells treated for 24 h with 8-Br-cAMP; kinetic analysis indicated that a decrease in Vmax, without a significant change in Km, accounted for the lower transport capacity of 8-Br-cAMP treated cells. Among the different transport systems contributing to amino acid entry, alanine preferring transport system (system A) appeared to be specifically affected. The sensitivity of transport processes to 8-Br-cAMP was tested in three cAMP-resistant cell lines. When tested for their capacity to phosphorylate histones in crude extracts, one strain had apparently normal amounts of protein kinase activity, one strain had a decreased enzyme sensitivity to cAMP, and one strain had little or no enzyme activity. In all three mutants, no effect of 8-Br-cAMP on 3-O-methyl glucose and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid transport could be observed, regardless of the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These data do not indicate whether the effect of cAMP on nutrient transport in CHO cells is the cause or consequence of growth inhibition. However, they support the conclusion that, in CHO cells, the presence of a normally functioning cAMP-dependent protein kinase appears to be necessary but may not be sufficient to observe the effects of cAMP on nutrient transport as well as cell shape and cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W179615635,"The enzyme helicase III catalyzes ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded DNA (Yarranto, G. T., Das, R. H., and Gefter, M. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11997-12001). The free enzyme is able to bind to double- and single-stranded DNA. In the presence of ATP the enzyme can bind single- but not double-stranded DNA. The enzyme catalyzes an ADP-ATP exchange reaction in the absence of DNA. It is suggested that there is an enzyme.phosphate complex that discriminates between the two forms of DNA. These results are discussed in relation to a model that accounts for catalytic unwinding of DNA coupled to ATP hydrolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1577327228,"Two selectively spin-labeled Cbz-Phe-tRNAsPhe, one at position s4U8 and the other at position U33, have been used to study the dynamics of tRNA-ribosome interaction in the presence of poly(U) and factors washable from ribosomes. Upon binding to the ribosome, the correlation time of the spin label at position s4U8 decreases markedly while the same parameter for the label in the anticodon increases. The presence of poly(U) is not a prerequisite condition for the EPR spectral changes observed but larger variation occurs in the presence of factors washable from ribosomes. No variation in the correlation time is observed if uncharged spin-labeled tRNAPhe (on the s4U8 residue) is used in these experiments. Most of the ribosome-bound spin-labeled Cbz-Phe-tRNAPhe are puromycin-reactive, and consequently, the observed effect is manifested mainly at the ribosomal P site. These observations seem to suggest that the interaction between the N-blocked aminoacyl residue on the tRNA and the ribosome results in a conformational change on the tRNA, possibly involving tertiary interactions in a region close to s4U8. The role that the amino acid at the 3'-end can possibly play on this structural change is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2024981840,"We report the characterization of Tn2 transpositions into the chromosome and into an F' lacproB episome of E. coli. When Tn2 transposes into the chromosome a proportion of the insertions result in auxotrophy. These insertions can revert to prototrophs and lose ampicillin resistance concomitantly. However, Tn2 insertions in F' lacproB are often associated with deletions, and it seems probable that insertion and deletion occur simultaneously."
