https://openalex.org/W2084271408,"Background Metastatic melanoma is an untreatable cancer lacking reliable and non-invasive markers of disease progression. Exosomes are small vesicles secreted by normal as well as tumor cells. Human tumor-derived exosomes are involved in malignant progression and we evaluated the presence of exosomes in plasma of melanoma patients as a potential tool for cancer screening and follow-up. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed an in-house sandwich ELISA (Exotest) to capture and quantify exosomes in plasma based on expression of housekeeping proteins (CD63 and Rab-5b) and a tumor-associated marker (caveolin-1). Western blot and flow cytometry analysis of exosomes were used to confirm the Exotest-based findings. The Exotest allowed sensitive detection and quantification of exosomes purified from human tumor cell culture supernatants and plasma from SCID mice engrafted with human melanoma. Plasma levels of exosomes in melanoma-engrafted SCID mice correlated to tumor size. We evaluated the levels of plasma exosomes expressing CD63 and caveolin-1 in melanoma patients (n = 90) and healthy donors (n = 58). Consistently, plasma exosomes expressing CD63 (504±315) or caveolin-1 (619±310) were significantly increased in melanoma patients as compared to healthy donors (223±125 and 228±102, respectively). While the Exotest for CD63+ plasma exosomes had limited sensitivity (43%) the Exotest for detection of caveolin-1+ plasma exosomes showed a higher sensitivity (68%). Moreover, caveolin-1+ plasma exosomes were significantly increased with respect to CD63+ exosomes in the patients group. Conclusions/Significance We describe a new non-invasive assay allowing detection and quantification of human exosomes in plasma of melanoma patients. Our results suggest that the Exotest for detection of plasma exosomes carrying tumor-associated antigens may represent a novel tool for clinical management of cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2129413349,"CGD is an immunodeficiency caused by deletions or mutations in genes that encode subunits of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase complex. Normally, assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex in phagosomes of certain phagocytic cells leads to a “respiratory burst”, essential for the clearance of phagocytosed micro-organisms. CGD patients lack this mechanism, which leads to life-threatening infections and granuloma formation. However, a clear picture of the clinical course of CGD is hampered by its low prevalence (∼1∶250,000). Therefore, extensive clinical data from 429 European patients were collected and analyzed. Of these patients 351 were males and 78 were females. X-linked (XL) CGD (gp91phox deficient) accounted for 67% of the cases, autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance for 33%. AR-CGD was diagnosed later in life, and the mean survival time was significantly better in AR patients (49.6 years) than in XL CGD (37.8 years), suggesting a milder disease course in AR patients. The disease manifested itself most frequently in the lungs (66% of patients), skin (53%), lymph nodes (50%), gastrointestinal tract (48%) and liver (32%). The most frequently cultured micro-organisms per episode were Staphylococcus aureus (30%), Aspergillus spp. (26%), and Salmonella spp. (16%). Surprisingly, Pseudomonas spp. (2%) and Burkholderia cepacia (<1%) were found only sporadically. Lesions induced by inoculation with BCG occurred in 8% of the patients. Only 71% of the patients received antibiotic maintenance therapy, and 53% antifungal prophylaxis. 33% were treated with γ-interferon. 24 patients (6%) had received a stem cell transplantation. The most prominent reason of death was pneumonia and pulmonary abscess (18/84 cases), septicemia (16/84) and brain abscess (4/84). These data provide further insight in the clinical course of CGD in Europe and hopefully can help to increase awareness and optimize the treatment of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2063150491,"Background Coral reefs around the world are experiencing large-scale degradation, largely due to global climate change, overfishing, diseases and eutrophication. Climate change models suggest increasing frequency and severity of warming-induced coral bleaching events, with consequent increases in coral mortality and algal overgrowth. Critically, the recovery of damaged reefs will depend on the reversibility of seaweed blooms, generally considered to depend on grazing of the seaweed, and replenishment of corals by larvae that successfully recruit to damaged reefs. These processes usually take years to decades to bring a reef back to coral dominance. Methodology/Principal Findings In 2006, mass bleaching of corals on inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef caused high coral mortality. Here we show that this coral mortality was followed by an unprecedented bloom of a single species of unpalatable seaweed (Lobophora variegata), colonizing dead coral skeletons, but that corals on these reefs recovered dramatically, in less than a year. Unexpectedly, this rapid reversal did not involve reestablishment of corals by recruitment of coral larvae, as often assumed, but depended on several ecological mechanisms previously underestimated. Conclusions/Significance These mechanisms of ecological recovery included rapid regeneration rates of remnant coral tissue, very high competitive ability of the corals allowing them to out-compete the seaweed, a natural seasonal decline in the particular species of dominant seaweed, and an effective marine protected area system. Our study provides a key example of the doom and boom of a highly resilient reef, and new insights into the variability and mechanisms of reef resilience under rapid climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2159180716,"Background Economic feasibility and sustainability of lignocellulosic ethanol production requires the development of robust microorganisms that can efficiently degrade and convert plant biomass to ethanol. The anaerobic thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum is a candidate microorganism as it is capable of hydrolyzing cellulose and fermenting the hydrolysis products to ethanol and other metabolites. C. thermocellum achieves efficient cellulose hydrolysis using multiprotein extracellular enzymatic complexes, termed cellulosomes. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we used quantitative proteomics (multidimensional LC-MS/MS and 15N-metabolic labeling) to measure relative changes in levels of cellulosomal subunit proteins (per CipA scaffoldin basis) when C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was grown on a variety of carbon sources [dilute-acid pretreated switchgrass, cellobiose, amorphous cellulose, crystalline cellulose (Avicel) and combinations of crystalline cellulose with pectin or xylan or both]. Cellulosome samples isolated from cultures grown on these carbon sources were compared to 15N labeled cellulosome samples isolated from crystalline cellulose-grown cultures. In total from all samples, proteomic analysis identified 59 dockerin- and 8 cohesin-module containing components, including 16 previously undetected cellulosomal subunits. Many cellulosomal components showed differential protein abundance in the presence of non-cellulose substrates in the growth medium. Cellulosome samples from amorphous cellulose, cellobiose and pretreated switchgrass-grown cultures displayed the most distinct differences in composition as compared to cellulosome samples from crystalline cellulose-grown cultures. While Glycoside Hydrolase Family 9 enzymes showed increased levels in the presence of crystalline cellulose, and pretreated switchgrass, in particular, GH5 enzymes showed increased levels in response to the presence of cellulose in general, amorphous or crystalline. Conclusions/Significance Overall, the quantitative results suggest a coordinated substrate-specific regulation of cellulosomal subunit composition in C. thermocellum to better suit the organism's needs for growth under different conditions. To date, this study provides the most comprehensive comparison of cellulosomal compositional changes in C. thermocellum in response to different carbon sources. Such studies are vital to engineering a strain that is best suited to grow on specific substrates of interest and provide the building blocks for constructing designer cellulosomes with tailored enzyme composition for industrial ethanol production."
https://openalex.org/W2039342473,"MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has been involved in the response to inflammation in macrophages and lymphocytes. Here we show how miR-155 participates in the maturation of human dendritic cells (DC) and modulates pathogen binding by down-regulating DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), after directly targeting the transcription factor PU.1. During the maturation of DCs, miR-155 increases up to 130-fold, whereas PU.1 protein levels decrease accordingly. We establish that human PU.1 is a direct target for miR-155 and localize the target sequence for miR-155 in the 3′-untranslated region of PU.1. Also, overexpression of miR-155 in the THP1 monocytic cell line decreases PU.1 protein levels and DC-SIGN at both the mRNA and protein levels. We prove a link between the down-regulation of PU.1 and reduced transcriptional activity of the DC-SIGN promoter, which is likely to be the basis for its reduced mRNA expression, after miR-155 overexpression. Finally, we show that, by reducing DC-SIGN in the cellular membrane, miR-155 is involved in regulating pathogen binding as dendritic cells exhibited the lower binding capacity for fungi and HIV protein gp-120 when the levels of miR-155 were higher. Thus, our results suggest a mechanism by which miR-155 regulates proteins involved in the cellular immune response against pathogens that could have clinical implications in the way pathogens enter the human organism.

MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulators of key cellular processes. They consist of endogenous small, non-coding RNA molecules of about 19–22 nucleotides in length (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29622) Google Scholar), which regulate mRNAs in a post-transcriptional manner. They bind to the 3′-untranslated regions of their target mRNAs and exert their function in two ways: mainly blocking the translation and also inducing their cleavage in a similar fashion to small interfering RNAs (2Stefani G. Slack F.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs are initially expressed as long immature pri-microRNAs, which are processed in the nucleus into the precursor pre-microRNAs and finally matured by Dicer in the cytoplasm into the functional 19–22-nucleotide long microRNAs, which are then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (1Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29622) Google Scholar). The role of microRNAs is being intensively studied in many different fields such as fetal development and the immune system. One of the miRNAs that appears to play a particularly important role in the immune system is microRNA-155 (miR-155), 3The abbreviations used are: miR-155microRNA-155UTRuntranslated regionDC-SIGNdendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrinDCdendritic cellHIV-1human immunodeficiency virus, type 1LPSlipopolysaccharideWTwild typeRTreverse transcriptaseqPCRquantitative PCR. the expression of which is induced by inflammatory signals such as exposure to antigen, Toll-like receptor ligands, or interferon γ stimulation in T-cells, B-cells, and macrophages, respectively (3O'Connell R.M.

These mutant mice exhibit an imbalance in the immune Th1/Th2 response, with the CD4+ T cells biased toward Th2 differentiation (4Rodriguez A. Vigorito E. Clare S. Warren M.V. Couttet P.

A lack of miR-155 also leads to a failure in production of high-affinity IgG1 antibodies by murine B-cells (28Vigorito E. Perks K.L. Abreu-Goodger C. Bunting S. Xiang Z. Kohlhaas S. Das P.P. Miska E.A. Rodriguez A. Bradley A. Smith K.G. Rada C. Enright A.J. Toellner K.M. Maclennan I.C. Turner M. Immunity. 2007; 27: 847-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This effect has been related to its ability to target the transcription factor PU.1, a key transcription factor in human hematopoiesis, restricted to B lymphoid, granulocytic, and monocytic cells (6Fisher R.C. Scott E.W. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). So far, the role of miR-155 in dendritic cell biology has not been studied in depth. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that have a pivotal role in controlling immune responses, directing them toward immune activation or tolerance (7Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12283) Google Scholar), orchestrating an efficient and protective immune response. DCs are present as sentinels in peripheral tissues where they capture antigens that will be presented to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs. They arise either from myeloid- or lymphoid-derived precursors and exhibit an immature phenotype characterized by a high phagocytic capacity and low expression of co-stimulatory molecules (8Wallet M.A. Sen P. Tisch R. Clin. Med. Res. 2005; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). DCs undergo a maturation process after “sensing” pathogen-derived structures through pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, or after ligation of the surface receptor CD40. Upon maturation, DCs stop taking up antigens and change their pattern of homing receptors, acquiring a phenotype that allows them to migrate into the T cell compartments, where they perform their antigen presenting function. Many transcription factors such as NF-κB and PU.1 are involved in this process, although no microRNA has been implicated so far. In addition to its role in DC maturation, PU.1 has been implicated in the differentiation of DCs from myeloid precursors. In this process, the balance between PU.1 and MafB determines the phenotype as being a dendritic cell or a macrophage (9Bakri Y. Sarrazin S. Mayer U.P. Tillmanns S. Nerlov C. Boned A. Sieweke M.H. Blood. 2005; 105: 2707-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PU.1 controls a number of myeloid genes, and it has been shown to contribute to transcriptional expression of DC-SIGN (CD209) (10Domínguez-Soto A. Puig-Kröger A. Vega M.A. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33123-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin, present in myeloid dendritic cells, that binds a large array of pathogens via mannan- and Lewis oligosaccharides-dependent interactions (11Serrano-Gómez D.

For example, it has been proposed that DC-SIGN binds to HIV-1, facilitating transport of the virus by DCs' migrating into the lymph nodes, thus promoting transinfection of CD4+ lymphocytes (16Geijtenbeek T.B.

Moreover, CD209 mediates transient adhesion contact with T cells through intercellular adhesion molecule 3 recognition, (17Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.

Med. 2005; 201: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). DC-SIGN is mainly expressed in DCs and macrophages activated by interleukin-4, and is down-regulated together with PU.1 during maturation of human DCs (10Domínguez-Soto A. Puig-Kröger A. Vega M.A. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33123-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that miR-155 levels increase during maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We show that human miR-155 directly targets the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of PU.1 mRNA and we map the target sequence for miR-155 binding. We also present a stably transfected, inducible cell system using the THP-1 monocytic cell line. This cell line, hence forth named THP1–155, was able to overexpress miR-155 in a regulated fashion, after treatment with doxycycline. In this system, we prove that overexpression of miR-155 elicits protein level down-regulation of PU.1 and subsequently of DC-SIGN mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-155 reduction increased DC-SIGN levels in the membrane of DCs resulting in impaired pathogen binding capacity. Thus, inhibition of miR-155 by synthetic oligonucleotides increased the binding of DCs to both Candida albicans and HIV-1 protein (gp120). Our results show how DC-SIGN, a protein of functional importance in the immune system, is regulated indirectly by miR-155 by direct targeting of the transcription factor PU.1. This has an important physiological role in the pathogen binding ability of dendritic cells, with potentially important effects on the entry and interaction of pathogens such as HIV-1. Dendritic cells were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells as previously described (20Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4504) Google Scholar). Monocytes were cultured for 5–7 days in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) with 1000 units/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and 1000 units/ml interleukin-4 (Immunotools) to obtain immature DCs. To mature these DCs, ultrapure LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (1 μg/ml) was used. The cell line THP1–155 was cultured in RPMI complete medium. HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. The genomic region encompassing miR-155 was amplified and cloned into HindIII/XhoI of the pCDNA3.1 multicloning site. Primers employed were BIC-FOR, AAGCTTTATGCCTCATCCTCTGAGTGC and BIC-REV, CTCGAGACGAAGGTTGAACATCCCAGTGACC. The same fragment as above was first cloned in pSUPER in the HindIII/XhoI sites, from where it was removed using EcoRI and MluI sites, and then subcloned into pLVTHM. pRLTK_WT_3′UTR_PU1 was generated by cloning the 3′-UTR of human PU.1 into XbaI and NotI sites of the pRLTK vector (Promega). PU.1 3′UTR was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR amplification following the protocol established by Ralser et al. (21Ralser M. Querfurth R. Warnatz H.J. Lehrach H. Yaspo M.L. Krobitsch S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 347: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 3′-UTR PU.1 FOR2 (TCT AGA TAC GAC TTC AGC GGC GAA GTG CTG) and 3′-UTR PU.1 REV BamHI (GGA TCC GGA TTG AGA ATA ACT TTA CTT G). pRLTK_MUT_ 3′UTR_PU1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis on pRLTK_WT_3′UTR_PU1. This vector was mutated in the putative miR-155 binding site, using the following primers: 3′UTR_Mut_PU.1 FOR (GCC TCC CCG CTG GCC TGA ATT CGA AGC CCT CGC CCG GCC CGG) and 3′UTR_Mut_PU.1 REV (CCG GGC CGG GCG AGG GCT TCG AAT TCA GGC CAG CGG GGA GGC). Mutagenesis was done using the QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's instructions. To generate the THP1–155 cell line, HEK293 T cells were transfected with Superfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol with 5 μg of pLVTHM_BIC (or pLV/tTR_KRAB_Red in the case of generating the repressor lentiviral particles), 3.75 μg of pPAX2 and 1.5 μg of pMD2G. Supernatant from these cells, containing lentiviral particles, was added to THP-1 cells that were preincubated in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Infection was checked 4 days after infection, and positive cells were sorted. All the vectors used in the lentiviral system were kindly provided by Prof. Didier Trono (Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland). For the luciferase promoter assays, we used the pCD209–468 pXP2 reporter plasmid, which contains the proximal region of the DC-SIGN promoter and pCDNA3.1-PU.1 encoding for full-length PU.1 (10Domínguez-Soto A. Puig-Kröger A. Vega M.A. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33123-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. A. L. Corbi (Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Spain). pCDNA3.1_PU.1_3UTR was generated by inserting the 3′-UTR of PU.1 after the coding region of pCDNA3.1 employing a blunt end ligation strategy. THP1–155 cells were electroporated following standard procedures. Electroporation results were normalized by co-transfection with the pRLTK-Renilla luciferase plasmid. To assess direct targeting of miR-155, pRLTK, pRLTK_WT_3′UTR_PU1, or pRLTK_MUT_3′UTR_ PU1 were transfected into HeLa cells employing Superfect (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. pCDNA3.1.BIC or pCDNA3.1 empty vector was co-transfected. Normalization was achieved with co-transfection of pGL3 (Promega). All luciferase/Renilla luciferase assays were measured employing the Dual-Glo kit from Promega. The experiments were performed three times in triplicates. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test. For the pathogen binding experiments, mature DCs were transfected with 100 nm of oligonucleotides anti-miR-155 or anti-miR-Control, and 50 nm Cy3-premiR-control-1 (Ambion) at day 5 of culture. Cy3 fluorescence was used both to assess transfection efficiency and to specifically select the transfected population of DCs. DC-SIGN surface expression was checked by flow cytometry, using 0.3 ng/μl APC-anti-human DC-SIGN antibody or APC Rat IgG2a as Isotype Control (eBiosciences). To perform the binding assays, C. albicans was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, inactivated at 90 °C for 20 min, and stained using propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. Blocking of DC-SIGN was done using 20 μg/ml of AZND1 (Beckman Coulter) or a matched isotype, incubating cells for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then fixed with CellFix (BD Bioscience) for 30 min at 4 °C, and labeled Candida conidia or gp120-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Trinity Biotech) were added. Binding was performed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin), after which cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSAria, BD Biosciences). Data were processed with the program FlowJo. RNA samples were obtained using the TRIzol isolation (Invitrogen) method. Real time PCR using Applied Biosystems TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays was used to detect both mature miR-155 and the housekeeping RNU6B, which was used as normalizing control. These assays were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a stem loop primer was used for reverse transcription of 2 ng of total RNA in two steps (30 min, 16 °C; 30 min, 37 °C), followed by qPCR employing the FAM-TaqMan probe and primers provided. Perfectprobe, from PrimerDesign (Southampton SO15 0DJ), was employed to detect DC-SIGN (For, TGTAGGAATGGTCTGGACTAGG; Rev, CAAGGGGAGAGAGAGGATGG) and PU.1 (For, TGCCCTATGACACGGATCTATA; Rev, GTAATGGTCGCTATGGCTCTC) mRNA. Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 (1%), 2 mm Pefablock, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, at 4 °C for 10 min. 30 μg of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Protein detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Antibodies employed were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.: α-PU.1 (sc-352); α-DC-SIGN (sc-20081), and α-tubulin (sc-58667). Quantity One program was used to quantify PU.1 in Fig. 3. DC maturation can be induced by several stimuli such as components of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and cytokines. Lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, flagellin, CpG motifs, and viral nucleic acids induce Toll-like receptor signaling, which triggers dendritic cell maturation. It has been shown previously that most of these inflammatory stimuli up-regulate miR-155 levels in macrophages by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway (3O'Connell R.M. Taganov K.D. Boldin M.P.

To determine whether this up-regulation occurs during dendritic cell maturation, we exposed monocyte-derived DC to LPS, which is widely reported to drive DC maturation (23Cella M. Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We then followed the changes in miR-155 levels over time in these cells, by use of reverse transcription followed by stem loop-specific quantitative PCR. During LPS-induced maturation, we could detect increased differential expression of miR-155 by 6 h, whereas a maximum value of 136-fold increase was reached by 48 h; no significant change occurred in the immature DCs over that time (Fig. 1A). It has been described that PU.1 protein levels decrease during DC maturation (10Domínguez-Soto A. Puig-Kröger A. Vega M.A. Corbí A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33123-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). From computer analyses using different programs that predicted PU.1 as a putative target of miR-155 (24Griffiths-Jones S. Saini H.K. van Dongen S. Enright A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D154-D158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar, 25Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar), we wondered whether there was a correlation between the increase in miR-155 levels and the pattern of expression of PU.1 over the maturation process. PU.1 protein expression in maturing DCs was assessed by Western blotting, and we observed that PU.1 levels decreased over time; levels were reduced at 12 h, whereas they remained constant in immature DCs over this time (Fig. 1B). Also, the levels of PU.1 mRNA in these cells were determined by qPCR. LPS stimulation also reduced the levels of PU.1 mRNA (Fig. 1C). Thus, miR-155 levels increased during DC maturation, whereas PU.1 protein and mRNA levels decreased. These data suggested that miR-155 might play a role during DC maturation, and it raised the possibility that PU.1 might be targeted by miR-155 during this process. Using bioinformatic databases, miR-155 was predicted to target human PU.1 (24Griffiths-Jones S. Saini H.K. van Dongen S. Enright A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D154-D158Crossref PubMed Scopus (3625) Google Scholar, 25Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B.

The core binding sequence (seeding region) for this microRNA in the 3′-UTR of PU.1 has a perfect 9-base Watson-Crick match, above the usual target-microRNA matches, and is also widely conserved across several species. To date, there have been several reports unveiling direct targets of miR-155: angiotensin II, several NF-κB pathway gene transcripts (Ripk1, IKKϵ, and FADD), MAF and, more recently, miR-155 was demonstrated to target the 3′-UTR of murine PU.1 (4Rodriguez A.

To prove, for the first time, a direct link between miR-155 and human PU.1, we performed luciferase reporter assays in HeLa cells. For this assay, we generated a reporter construct that expressed a fusion protein between the Renilla luciferase mRNA and the 3′-UTR of PU.1 (pRLTK-WT-PU.1). Also, we generated an alternative construct in which the predicted seeding region for miR-155 in the 3′-UTR of PU.1 was mutated (pRLTK-MUT-PU.1) (shown in Fig. 2B). This mutation was decided upon by the abrogation of the match between miR-155 and the 3′-UTR of PU.1, as predicted by the RNA-Hybrid program (29Krüger J. Rehmsmeier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W451-W454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were co-transfected with a plasmid that expressed miR-155 and one of the Renilla luciferase fusion plasmids described, or the empty vector. It was found that co-transfection of the plasmid expressing miR-155 reduced the activity of the wild type 3′-UTR of the PU.1 reporter by ∼85%. The reporters that did not contain the seeding sequence for miR-155, both control and mutant exhibited no significant reduction in their Renilla luciferase activity, when co-transfected with the miR-155 expressing vector (Fig. 2A). As a conclusion, our experimental results confirm the target prediction given by different bioinformatic databases and establish that human PU.1 is indeed a direct functional target of miR-155. We also localized the binding region for miR-155 on the 3′-UTR of PU.1, because mutation of the predicted seeding region abrogated the down-regulation exerted by miR-155. During DC maturation, after LPS stimulation, there is a correlation between the increase in miR-155 levels and the decrease in PU.1 (Fig. 1). Because of the profound influence of pro-inflammatory stimuli on gene expression, LPS may trigger a number of direct or indirect cellular responses that could lead to a decrease of PU.1 during DC maturation. To dissect whether there is a link between the presence of increased levels of miR-155 and the down-regulation of PU.1, we generated a cellular system in which we could rule out an effect due to other signaling pathways activated by LPS. To achieve this, we employed lentiviral vectors containing a sequence that could be processed into mature miR-155, under the transcriptional control of the Tetracycline TeT repressor motif, based on a Tet-on system (30Bulliard Y. Wiznerowicz M. Barde I. Trono D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35742-35746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We stably transduced THP-1 monocytic cells, thus generating a cell line in which the expression of miR-155 is induced after addition of doxycycline, a tetracycline derivative, to the culture medium. Therefore, this cell line, THP1–155, is able to express miR-155 in the absence of LPS or other inflammatory stimuli. This allowed us to elucidate more clearly the effect of miR-155 on the regulation of PU.1 in a myeloid cell line. We compared THP1–155 cells treated or untreated with doxycycline over the course of 96 h. Then, we determined the levels of miR-155 during this period, using RT qPCR, as described above. The results showed an increase in the levels of miR-155 (Fig. 3A) over time, reaching a maximum of 8-fold induction 96 h after transgene induction, when compared with the doxycycline untreated, non-induced control. We then interrogated the system for the expression of PU.1 to establish a link between the expression of miR-155 and the previously observed reduction in PU.1 protein and mRNA levels in DCs (Fig. 1). We performed PU.1 protein detection by Western blot and, as expected, when miR-155 was overexpressed following doxycycline treatment, the levels of PU.1 were clearly reduced, reaching the minimum expression in the doxycycline-treated THP1–155 after 96 h (Fig. 3B). PU.1 protein levels were reduced by approximately 85% at this time point, which correlated with the maximum value of miR-155, an 8-fold induction, both compared with time 0 h. To learn more about the mechanism of action of miR-155 on the regulation of PU.1, we determined the mRNA levels of PU.1 over the same time course. We quantified the expression of PU.1 mRNA by RT qPCR, comparing doxycycline-treated with untreated THP1–155 cells. Fig. 3C shows that the increase of miR-155 in THP1–155 cells does not affect the expression levels of PU.1 mRNA. This result suggests that miR-155 might be blocking the translation of PU.1 mRNA, a common mechanism of action of microRNAs. Thus, aspects of DC maturation that are related to miR-155 are mimicked by THP1–155 cells. In this regard, an increase of miR-155 over time results in a decrease in PU.1 protein levels. These data demonstrate a direct link between the expression of miR-155 and the protein expression levels of the transcription factor PU.1. DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin that mediates binding and internalization of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens by myeloid dendritic cells. This is an important role of immature DCs, as they act as immune sentinels sampling their surroundings in search for pathogen antigens. Also, it has been reported that DC-SIGN triggers intracellular signals that modulate dendritic cell maturation (31Caparrós E. Munoz P. Sierra-Filardi E. Serrano-Gómez D."
https://openalex.org/W2045828622,"Dishevelled (Dvl) is an essential protein in the Wnt signaling pathways; it uses its PDZ domain to transduce the Wnt signals from the membrane receptor Frizzled to downstream components. Here, we report identifying a drug-like small molecule compound through structure-based ligand screening and NMR spectroscopy and show the compound to interact at low micromolar affinity with the PDZ domain of Dvl. In a Xenopus testing system, the compound could permeate the cell membrane and block the Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, the compound inhibited Wnt signaling and reduced the levels of apoptosis in the hyaloid vessels of eye. Moreover, this compound also suppressed the growth of prostate cancer PC-3 cells. These biological effects suggest that by blocking the PDZ domain of Dvl, the compound identified in our studies effectively inhibits the Wnt signaling and thus provides a useful tool for studies dissecting the Wnt signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2139288598,"Eukaryotic cells extend pseudopodia for movement. In the absence of external cues, cells move in random directions, but with a strong element of persistence that keeps them moving in the same direction Persistence allows cells to disperse over larger areas and is instrumental to enter new environments where spatial cues can lead the cell. Here we explore cell movement by analyzing the direction, size and timing of ∼2000 pseudopodia that are extended by Dictyostelium cells. The results show that pseudpopod are extended perpendicular to the surface curvature at the place where they emerge. The location of new pseudopods is not random but highly ordered. Two types of pseudopodia may be formed: frequent splitting of an existing pseudopod, or the occasional extension of a de novo pseudopod at regions devoid of recent pseudopod activity. Split-pseudopodia are extended at ∼60 degrees relative to the previous pseudopod, mostly as alternating Right/Left/Right steps leading to relatively straight zigzag runs. De novo pseudopodia are extended in nearly random directions thereby interrupting the zigzag runs. Persistence of cell movement is based on the ratio of split versus de novo pseudopodia. We identify PLA2 and cGMP signaling pathways that modulate this ratio of splitting and de novo pseudopodia, and thereby regulate the dispersal of cells. The observed ordered extension of pseudopodia in the absence of external cues provides a fundamental insight into the coordinated movement of cells, and might form the basis for movement that is directed by internal or external cues."
https://openalex.org/W2080179721,"Genes of the S100 fused-type protein (SFTP) family are clustered within the epidermal differentiation complex and encode essential components that maintain epithelial homeostasis and barrier functions. Recent genetic studies have shown that mutations within the gene encoding the SFTP filaggrin cause ichthyosis vulgaris and are major predisposing factors for atopic dermatitis. As a vital component of healthy skin, filaggrin is also a precursor of natural moisturizing factors. Here we present the discovery of a member of this family, designated as filaggrin-2 (FLG2) that is expressed in human skin. The FLG2 gene encodes a histidine- and glutamine-rich protein of approximately 248 kDa, which shares common structural features with other SFTP members, in particular filaggrin. We found that FLG2 transcripts are present in skin, thymus, tonsils, stomach, testis and placenta. In cultured primary keratinocytes, FLG2 mRNA expression displayed almost the same kinetics as that of filaggrin following Ca2+ stimulation, suggesting an important role in molecular regulation of epidermal terminal differentiation. We provide evidences that like filaggrin, FLG2 is initially expressed by upper granular cells, proteolytically processed and deposited in the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum (SC) layers of normal epidermis. Thus, FLG2 and filaggrin may have overlapping and perhaps synergistic roles in the formation of the epidermal barrier, protecting the skin from environmental insults and the escape of moisture by offering precursors of natural moisturizing factors."
https://openalex.org/W2162135627,"Background There is widespread interest in biofuel crops as a solution to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual, relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting continues to be largely unregulated. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a widely accepted weed risk assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate. Conclusions/Significance Because of climatic and ecological similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are applicable to other vulnerable island and subtropical ecosystems worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures, such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks, which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting policies and adoption of the “polluter-pays” principle."
https://openalex.org/W2046342087,"Our previous studies have demonstrated that nuclear factor I-C (NFI-C) null mice developed short molar roots that contain aberrant odontoblasts and abnormal dentin formation. Based on these findings, we performed studies to elucidate the function of NFI-C in odontoblasts. Initial studies demonstrated that aberrant odontoblasts become dissociated and trapped in an osteodentin-like mineralized tissue. Abnormal odontoblasts exhibit strong bone sialoprotein expression but a decreased level of dentin sialophosphoprotein expression when compared with wild type odontoblasts. Loss of Nfic results in an increase in p-Smad2/3 expression in aberrant odontoblasts and pulp cells in the subodontoblastic layer in vivo and primary pulp cells from Nfic-deficient mice in vitro. Cell proliferation analysis of both cervical loop and ectomesenchymal cells of the Nfic-deficient mice revealed significantly decreased proliferative activity compared with wild type mice. In addition, Nfic-deficient primary pulp cells showed increased expression of p21 and p16 but decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin B1, strongly suggesting cell growth arrest caused by a lack of Nfic activity. Analysis of the pulp and abnormal dentin in Nfic-deficient mice revealed an increase in apoptotic activity. Further, Nfic-deficient primary pulp cells exhibited an increase in caspase-8 and -3 activation, whereas the cleaved form of Bid was hardly detected. These results indicate that the loss of Nfic leads to the suppression of odontogenic cell proliferation and differentiation and induces apoptosis of aberrant odontoblasts during root formation, thereby contributing to the formation of short roots."

Of note, although for virus-to-cell entry and for cell-cell fusion, fusion requires the simultaneous presence of gB and gH/gL, fusion of perinuclear virions with the outer nuclear membranes appears to necessitate either gH/gL or gB (24Farnsworth A.

It was hypothesized that gB and gH/gL activation occurs through their recruitment to activated gD and that the C-terminal profusion domain carries the actual binding sites for gB and gH/gL (9Cocchi F. Fusco D. Menotti L. Gianni T. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. Campadelli-Fiume G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7445-7450Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Krummenacher C.

An alternative possibility is that the C-terminal profusion domain simply enables the conformational changes in gD but does not carry the actual binding sites for gB and gH/gL. Efforts to validate the model prompted the search of interactions among the glycoprotein quartet. So far, it was found that HSV-infected cells harbor a co-immunoprecipitable complex made of HVEM, gD, and gH (28Perez-Romero P. Perez A. Capul A. Montgomery R. Fuller A.O. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 4540-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A number of interactions were detected in transfected whole cells by split green fluorescent protein (or variations thereof) complementation assay (29Atanasiu D. Whitbeck J.C. Cairns T.M. Reilly B.

Virol. 2007; 81: 11532-11537Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The interactions were gD-gH/gL, gD-gB, and gB-gH/gL. The former two were found in cells transfected with two or three glycoproteins and are believed to mirror interactions that take place before gD activation. In contrast, the gB-gH/gL interaction was detected at fusion. Whether such interactions occur in infected cells or are seen only in transfected cells under conditions of high overexpression and whether they lead to biochemically defined complexes have not been investigated so far. In addition, inasmuch as the split green fluorescent protein complementation irreversibly stabilizes weak and transients interactions, it tends to overemphasize interactions. For other herpesviruses, evidence is accumulating of complex formation among the glycoproteins involved in virus entry. Thus, Epstein-Barr virus gH and gL form a complex with the receptor-binding glycoprotein gp42; human cytomegalovirus and murine γ-herpesvirus 68 gH and gL form a complex with gB (31Gillet L.

The objective of this work was to provide biochemical evidence for complex formation among the glycoprotein quartet, to verify whether complexes are present in infected cells and in virions and whether they are formed at virus entry into the cell. We analyzed the composition of the complexes by two approaches, co-immunoprecipitation and a pulldown assay that exploits the ability of One-strep-tagged proteins to be specifically retained by the Strep-Tactin resin. Complexes with undistinguishable composition were detected in infected and transfected cells and in virions prior to entry into the cell. A panel of mutants enabled the preliminary location of part of the gD regions critical to gB- and gH/gL-binding sites at the profusion domain. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium containing 5–20% fetal calf serum. HSV-1(F) was described (34Ejercito P.M. Kieff E.D. Roizman B. J. Gen.

The 5E1 epitope consists of a 27-aa-long sequence recognized by mAb 5E1, initially derived to human herpesvirus 7 (39Stefan A. Secchiero P. Baechi T. Kempf W. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5758-5763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5E1 epitope was inserted in gH (gH5E1), and the thrombin plus 5E1 and His (polyhistidine) epitopes were inserted in gL (gL5E1.His), just upstream of the stop codon. To generate gH5E1, a SphI restriction site was inserted in the cytoplasmic tail of gH, in place of the stop codon, by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides 5′-CCG TTT TTT TGG AGA CGC ATG CAA AGT GGG CGT GAA TTC GGC CGT TTC TCC GCC C-3′ and 5′-GGG CGG AGA AAC GGC CGA ATT CAC GCC CAC TTT GCA TGC GTC TCC AAA AAA ACG G-3′. The oligonucleotides contained EcoRI restriction site for screening and introduced a single mutation, E838M. Two annealing oligonucleotides, encoding the 5E1 epitope 5′-ACA TGC ATG CAT GTT TCC AGA CCA GGA AGC ACT ACA CCC TCT GGG AAC TCT GCA AGA TAT GGG-3′ and 5′-GGA AGA TCT GGT ACC TTA CGG AGT TAT ACT TCT AGG TGT GTT ATT CCC ATA TCT TGC AGA GTT CCC-3′ were ligated to SphI/BglII-digested gH. The oligonucleotides contained the Asp718 restriction site for easiness of screening. The aa sequence of gH5E1 cytoplasmic tail was modified to ILKVLRTSVPFFWRRMHVSRPGSTTPSGNSARYGNNTPRSITP. To generate gHst.V5, indicated below also as gHst, we followed a similar strategy; the annealing oligonucleotides encoding the Factor Xa protease cleavage site, followed by V5 and One-strep-tag epitopes, were 5′-GGA GAC GCA TGC TAA TCG AAG GGC GAG GTA AGC CTA TCC CTA ACC CTC TCC TAG GCC TCG ATT CTA CGA GCG CTT GGA GCC ACC CGC AGT TCG AGA AAG G-3′ and 5′-GGT AGT AGA TCT CAT TTT TCG AAC TGC GGG TGG CTC CAC GAT CCA CCT CCC GAT CCA CCT CCG GAA CCT CCA CCT TTC TCG AAC TGC GGG TGG CTC CAA G-3′. They were ligated to the SphI/BglII-digested gH. The aa sequence of gHst.V5 cytoplasmic tail became ILKVLRTSVPFFWRRMLIEGRGLPIPNPLLGLDSTSAWSHPQFELGGGSGGGSGGGSWSHPQFEL. To generate gL5E1.His, we followed essentially a similar strategy and inserted the NheI restriction site by site-directed mutagenesis, in place of the stop codon, by means of oligonucleotides 5′-CCC CAC TCC CGG CGC CTG CTA GCA TGA ATT CAC GGA AAC CCG TCC GGG TTC GGG-3′ and 5′-CCC GAA CCC GGA CGG GTT TCC GTG AAT TCA TGC TAG CAG GCG CCG GGA GTG GGG-3′. The annealing oligonucleotides encoding the trombin-5E1-His epitopes were 5′-CTA TAG CTA GCC CTG GTT CCG CGT GGA TCC TCC AGA CCA GGA AGC ACT ACA CCC TCT GGG AAC TCT GCA AGA TAT GGG AA-3′ and 5′-GGA AGA TCT TCA ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG ATG CGG AGT TAT ACT TCT AGG TGT GTT ATT CCC ATA TCT TGC AGA GTT CCC-3′ and were ligated to NheI/BglII digested gL. The aa sequence of the gL C terminus was changed from SRRL to SRRLLALVPRGSSRPGSTTPSGNSARYGNNTPRSITPHHHHHH. To generate gLV5.His, the annealing oligonucleotides encoding the V5 and His epitopes were 5′-ATG CTC GCT AGC TGG TAA GCC TAT CCC TAA CCC TCT CCT CGG TCT CGA TTC TAC GC-3′ and 5′-TTA GCG AGA TCT CAA TGG TGA TGA TGG TGA TGA TGA ACG GTA CGC GTA GAA TCG AGA C-3′ and were ligated to NheI/BglII-digested gL. The aa sequence of gL C terminus was changed from SRRL to SRRLLAGLPIPNPLLGLDSTRTVHHHHHHH. gCV5 was generated as follows. The gC ORF was PCR-amplified from HSV-1(F) DNA with primers encoding the V5 epitope 5′-AGA TCT AGG CCT ATG GCC CCG GGG CGG GTG GGC CTT GCC G TG GTC CTG TGG AGC CTG-3′ and 5′-GCA CGG GGC GGC CGC TTA CGT AGA ATC GAG ACC GAG GAG AGG GTT AGG GAT AGG GAT AGG CTT ACC GGC TAG CCG CCG ATG ACG CTG CCG CGA CTG TGA TGT GCG G-3′. The StuI-NotI-digested gC amplimer was ligated to MTS vector. For all plasmids, the ORF was sequenced. HSV1(BAC)-gDst was generated by bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) “galK recombineering,” employing the Escherichia coli strain SW102 and galK (galactokinase) positive/negative selectable marker, kindly provided by Dr. N. G. Copeland) (45Warming S. Costantino N. Court D.L. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). pYEbac102 HSV-BAC was provided by Y. Kawaguchi and carries the BAC sequences inserted between UL3 and UL4 genes. The galK cassette was recombined in HSV-1(BAC) to replace the gD stop codon. To this end, the cassette was PCR-amplified from pGalK plasmid with primers that annealed in their 5′ end to sequences upstream and downstream of gD stop codon. The oligonucleotides used for amplification were 5′-CCC ACA TCC GGG AAG ACG ACC AGC CGT CCT CGC ACC AGC CCT TGT TTT ACC CTG GTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGGCA-3′ and 5′-CAT CCC AAC CCC GCA GAC CTG ACC CCC CCG CAC CCA TTA AGG GGG GGT ATT CAG CAC TGT CCT GCT CCTT-3′. The amplimer was recombined into the HSV-1 BAC, and the recombinant bacteria were selected on minimal media containing galactose as the only carbon source. Next, the galK cassette was substituted with sequences encoding the One-strep-tag by means of a double-stranded oligonuocletide that carried flanking sequences homologous to gD sequences upstream and downstream of the stop codon. The double-stranded oligonucleotide was generated by annealing-extension of two synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-CCC ACA TCC GGG AAG ACG ACC AGC CGT CCT CGC ACC AGC CCT TGT TTT ACA GCG CTT GGA GCC ACC CGC AGT TCG AGA AAG GTG GAG GTT CCG GAG GTG GAT CCG GAG GT-3′ and 5′-CAT CCC AAC CCC GCA GAC CTG ACC CCC CCG CAC CCA TTA AGG GGG GGT ATT CAT TTT TCG AAC TGC GGG TGG CTC CAC GAT CCA CCT CCG GAT CCA CCT CCG GAA CC-3′. Its homologous recombination into the HSV-BAC was achieved by selecting against the galK cassette, i.e. by resistance to 2-deoxy-galactose on minimal plates containing glycerol as carbon source. Chloramphenicol selection was kept throughout, to maintain the HSV-BAC sequences. The recombinant HSV1(BAC)-gDst DNA was extracted from bacteria and transfected into 293 T cells to reconstitute the virus. The 3′ of gD gene was sequenced for accuracy in DNA extracted from bacteria and in virus stock. The linear map of the gD constructs employed in this study is shown in Fig. 6. To generate gDΣ240–260, the starting plasmid contained an Asp718 restriction site at aa 260 (46Cocchi F. Menotti L. Di Ninni V. Lopez M. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4720-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An additional Asp718 site was inserted at aa 240 by site-directed mutagenesis by means of oligonucleotides 5′-CAG CTT GAA GAT CGC GGT ACC GAA GCT TCC CAA GGC CCC ATA CAC GAG CAC CC-3′ and 5′-GGG TGC TCG TGT ATG GGG CCT TGG GAA GCT TCG GTA CCG CGA TCT TCA AGC TG-3′. Two synthetic annealing oligonucleotides encoding a 18-aa-long Ser-Gly linker 5′-PHO-GTA CCC AGT AGT GGC GGT GGC TCT GGA TCC GGC TCG AGC GGA GGC GGT AGC GGG-3′ and 5′-PHO-GGT CAT CAC CGC CAC CGA GAC CTA GGC CGA GCT CGC CTC CTC CAT CGC CCC ATG-3′ were ligated into Asp718-digested gD. Orientation was screened by colony PCR and confirmed by sequence. To generate gDΣ218–240, we followed essentially a similar strategy. Two Asp718 restrictions sites were introduced in gD plasmid at aa 218 and 240 by simultaneous double site-directed mutagenesis. The Asp718 site in aa 218 was inserted by means of oligonucleotides 5′-TGA CGG TGG ACA GCA TGG TAC CGC TGC CCC GCT TCA TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA TGA AGC GGG GCA GCG GTA CCA TGC TGT CCA CCG TCA-3′; the Asp718 site at aa 240 was inserted by means of the oligonucleotides described above for gDΣ240–260. The DNA encoding the 18-aa-long Ser-Gly linker was generate as above and ligated with Asp718-digested gD. Orientation was screened by colony PCR and confirmed by sequence. The starting plasmid for gDΔ61–218 was generated by Dr. L. Menotti in the course of an independent study. 4Menotti, L., Nicoletti, G., Gatta, V., Croci, S., Landuzzi, L., De Giovanni, C., Nanni, P., Lollini, P. L., and Campadelli-Fiume, G. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 106, in press. Briefly, the gD ORF, engineered in a vector designed to enable homologous recombination of mutant gD into HSV-BAC, was mutagenized by insertion of NdeI restriction sites at aa 60 and 218. Two synthetic annealing oligonucleotides encoding a 18-aa Ser-Gly linker (5′-PHO-TAG TAG TGG CGG TGG CTC TGG ATC CGG CTC GAG CGG AGG CGG TAG CGG GAG TGG-3′ and 5′-pho-TACC CAC TCC CGC TAC CGC CTC CGC TCG AGC CGG ATC CAG AGC CAC CGC CAC TAC-3′) were ligated into the NdeI-digested gD. Finally, the SacII/HindIII fragment containing the partially deleted ORF was subcloned in pcDNA containing gD ORF. Orientation was screened by colony PCR and confirmed by sequence. To generate gDΣ240–310, Asp718 restriction sites were engineered at aa 240 and 310 of wt gD, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis by means of oligonucleotides 5′-CAG CTT GAA GAT CGC GGT ACC GAA GCT TCC CAA GGC CCC ATA CAC GAG CAC CC 3′ and 5′-CAT CCC CCG GCG GTA CCG AAC AAC ATG GGC CTG 3′. A CD8 amplimer obtained with oligonucleotides 5′-CGG GGT ACC CAG TGG CGG TAG TTC GGC CCT GAG CAA CTC CATC3′ and 5′GCGC CCA GAT GTA GAT AGG TAC CGC GAA GTC CAG CCC CCT CGT GTGC 3′ and digested with Asp718 was then ligated into Asp718-digested gD. To generate gDΔ6–60, two EcoRI restrictions sites were introduced in pcDNA-gD plasmid by simultaneous double site-directed mutagenesis with prior elimination of the EcoRI site present in the vector. The EcoRI site at aa 6 was introduced by means of oligonucleotides 5′-CAA ATA TGC CTT GGC GGA GAA TTC TCT CAA GAT GGC CG-3′ and 5′-CGG CCA TCT TGA GAG AAT TCT CCG CCA AGG CAT ATT TG-3′; the EcoRI site at aa 59 was introduced by means of oligonucleotides 5′-CAC GGT TTA CTA CGC GAA TTC GGA GCG CGC CTG CCG-3′ and 5′-CGGC AG GC GCG CTC CGA ATT CGC GTA GTA AAC CGTG-3′. The EcoRI-digested gD was relegated, thus collapsing the EcoRI fragment. For all of the plasmids, the ORF was sequenced. Co-immunoprecipitation was carried out from infected or transfected cells. Infected 293 T cells received 5 PFU/cell of one of the following viruses, HSV-1(F), ΔgD, ΔgB, ΔgH, or ΔgL HSV, as titrated in Vero or their respective complementing cells.

The A539T substitution in BChE-K is located at the C terminus, which is essential both for BChE tetramerization and for its capacity to attenuate β-amyloid (Aβ) fibril formation. Here, we report that BChE-K is inherently unstable as compared with the “usual” BChE (BChE-U), resulting in reduced hydrolytic activity and predicting prolonged acetylcholine maintenance and protection from AD. A synthetic peptide derived from the C terminus of BChE-K (BSP-K), which displayed impaired intermolecular interactions, was less potent in suppressing Aβ oligomerization than its BSP-U counterpart. Correspondingly, highly purified recombinant human rBChE-U monomers suppressed β-amyloid fibril formation less effectively than dimers, which also protected cultured neuroblastoma cells from Aβ neurotoxicity. Dual activity structurally derived changes due to the A539T substitution can thus account for both neuroprotective characteristics caused by sustained acetylcholine levels and elevated AD risk due to inefficient interference with amyloidogenic processes.

The alternative theories state that Aβ represents a bystander or even a protector rather than the causative factor of disease and that Aβ amyloidogenesis is secondary to other pathogenic events (14Lee H.G. Casadesus G. Zhu X. Takeda A. Perry G. Smith M.A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1019: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a wealth of evidence demonstrates a pivotal role for Aβ in the pathogenesis of AD, yielding the amyloid cascade hypothesis (15Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10962) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the pathological accumulation of Aβ in the brain leads to oxidative stress, neuronal destruction, and finally, the clinical syndrome of AD. It is within this context that we have studied the interactions of the Kalow variant (BChE-K) with Aβ. butyrylcholinesterase Kalow variant of BChE usual BChE recombinant rBChE-U BChE-derived synthetic peptide acetylcholine acetylcholinesterase synaptic AChE acetylthiocholine Alzheimer disease β-amyloid poly-l-proline 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-sulfonate Transthyretin lactate dehydrogenase transmission electron microscopy thioflavin T N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine dimethyl sulfoxide. butyrylcholinesterase Kalow variant of BChE usual BChE recombinant rBChE-U BChE-derived synthetic peptide acetylcholine acetylcholinesterase synaptic AChE acetylthiocholine Alzheimer disease β-amyloid poly-l-proline 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-sulfonate Transthyretin lactate dehydrogenase transmission electron microscopy thioflavin T N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine dimethyl sulfoxide. The C terminus of BChE functions as a tetramerization domain (16Altamirano C.V. Lockridge O. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and is responsible for its quaternary organization. Four BChE monomers are held together by the aromatic interactions of seven highly conserved aromatic residues, termed the tryptophan amphiphilic tetramerization domain (WAT) (16Altamirano C.V. Lockridge O. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1999; 119–120: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Blong R.M. Bedows E. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The WAT domain interacts with proline-rich attachment domains, either via proline-rich membrane anchor in brain neurons (18Perrier A.L. Massoulié J. Krejci E. Neuron. 2002; 33: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) or, in neuromuscular junctions, with cholinesterase-associated collagen Q (19Bon S. Ayon A. Leroy J. Massoulié J. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the serum, BChE tetramerization is supported by an analogous 17-mer proline-rich peptide derived from lamellipodin (20Li H. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analyzing the quaternary organization of cholinesterases is a complicated task. To date, all biologically relevant crystal structures of cholinesterases have been truncated forms that lack the C terminus of the protein (21Nicolet Y. Lockridge O. Masson P. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Nachon F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41141-41147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), apart from a more recent study of full-length BChE that yielded crystal packing, which did not allow C-terminal interactions among subunits and lacked electron densities in the C terminus region, indicating structural disorder Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1VZJ (22Ngamelue M.N. Homma K. Lockridge O. Asojo O.A. Acta Crystallogr. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2007; 63: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Of note, the crystal structure of the homologous C terminus of tetrameric synaptic acetylcholinesterase (AChE-S) could only be determined based on synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the AChE-S tail and stabilized with a proline-rich attachment domain (23Dvir H. Harel M. Bon S. Liu W.Q. Vidal M. Garbay C. Sussman J.L. Massoulié J. Silman I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4394-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition to the “usual” (BChE-U) form, BChE has nearly 40 genomic variants. The most common is BChE-K, with allelic frequencies of 0.13–0.21. BChE-K includes a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 1699 (single nucleotide polymorphism data base (dbSNP) ID: rs1803274; alleles, A/G). This leads to an alanine-to-threonine substitution at position 539, 36 residues upstream to the C terminus of BChE (24Bartels C.F. Jensen F.S. Lockridge O. van der Spek A.F. Rubinstein H.M. Lubrano T. La Du B.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 1086-1103PubMed Google Scholar), within the tetramerization domain that we previously found to attenuate amyloid fibril formation (25Diamant S. Podoly E. Friedler A. Ligumsky H. Livnah O. Soreq H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Ample evidence supports the importance of alanine-to-threonine substitutions and their relevance to amyloidogenic processes, protein stability, and quaternary organization (supplemental Table ST1). Point mutations at the dimer interface of light chain immunoglobulins decrease their stability so that the A34T polymorphism in this protein leads to systemic amyloidosis (26Baden E.M. Owen B.A. Peterson F.C. Volkman B.F. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Thompson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15853-15860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An A25T mutant of the tetrameric human protein Transthyretin (TTR), associated with central nervous system amyloidosis, is prone to aggregation and exhibits drastically reduced tertiary and quaternary structural stabilities (27Hurshman Babbes A.R. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 6969-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability profile of the A25T TTR mutant shows that both monomers and tetramers of this variant are highly destabilized. In addition, A25T TTR tetramers dissociate very rapidly (about 1200-fold faster than the dissociation of wild-type TTR), reflecting a high degree of kinetic destabilization of their quaternary structure. These factors together probably contribute to the high propensity of A25T TTR to aggregate in vitro. The capacity of serum BChE-K to hydrolyze butyrylthiocholine was reported to be reduced by 30% relative to BChE-U, for yet unclear reasons (24Bartels C.F. Jensen F.S. Lockridge O. van der Spek A.F. Rubinstein H.M. Lubrano T. La Du B.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 50: 1086-1103PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced hydrolytic activity of BChE-K predicts that BChE-K carriers would potentially sustain improved cholinergic transmission as compared with BChE-U carriers and has been shown to correlate with preserved performance of attention and reduced rates of cognitive decline (28O'Brien K.K. Saxby B.K. Ballard C.G. Grace J. Harrington F. Ford G.A. O'Brien J.T. Swan A.G. Fairbairn A.F. Wesnes K. del Ser T. Edwardson J.A. Morris C.M. McKeith I.G. Pharmacogenetics. 2003; 13: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, BChE-K carriers are refractory to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy, the current leading treatment of AD (29Lopez O.L. Becker J.T. Wisniewski S. Saxton J. Kaufer D.I. DeKosky S.T. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2002; 72: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). This raised the question whether BChE-K functions as an AD risk or protection factor. Genotype studies are controversial, with some showing increased risk of AD for homozygote BChE-K carriers (e.g. Ref. 30Ghebremedhin E. Thal D.R. Schultz C. Braak H. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 320: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas others suggest a protective effect (e.g. Ref. 31Holmes C. Ballard C. Lehmann D. David Smith A. Beaumont H. Day I.N. Nadeem Khan M. Lovestone S. McCulley M. Morris C.M. Munoz D.G. O'Brien K. Russ C. Del Ser T. Warden D. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2005; 76: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A recent meta-analysis concluded that on average, BChE-K is neither a risk factor nor a protection factor for AD (32Bertram L. McQueen M.B. Mullin K. Blacker D. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Based on our previous findings of the arrest of Aβ fibril formation by BChE and considering the accumulation of monomeric BChE in the most severe AD cases (33Arendt T. Brückner M.K. Lange M. Bigl V. Neurochem. Int. 1992; 21: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we used a variety of chemical techniques to study the effect of the A539T substitution on BChE stability and tetramerization on the one hand and on its potency in attenuating Aβ oligomerization and fibril formation on the other. 321 (184 males, 137 female) healthy individuals (mean ± S.D. age: 65.99 ± 11.11 years) from various out-patient clinics of the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center were enrolled during the period from February 2001 to September 2004, as described (34Ben Assayag E. Bova I. Berliner S. Peretz H. Usher S. Shapira I. Bornstein N.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2006; 95: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Written informed consent, approved by the local ethics committee (consent form 00-116), was obtained from all participants. Genomic DNA was extracted from nucleated blood cells. For single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, a 214-bp PCR product was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CTGTACTGTGTAGTTAGAGAAAATGGC-3′ (nucleotide −105 to −79 upstream to the intron 3/exon 4 boundary) and the reverse primer 5′-CTTTCTTTCTTGCTAGTGTAATCG-3′ (nucleotides 1709-1686). A fluorescein-labeled anchor probe (5′-CCAGCGATGGAATCCTGCTTTCC-3′-FLU (fluorescein), nucleotides 1628–50) and a one base apart LC-Red-640-labeled detection probe (5′-CTCCCATTCTGCTTCATCAATATT-3′-PHO (phosphate), nucleotides 1603-26) were used as reported previously (35Gätke M.R. Viby-Mogensen J. Bundgaard J.R. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 2002; 62: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Acetylthiocholine (ATCh) hydrolytic activities were assessed in a microtiter plate assay as described, with or without the selective BChE inhibitor iso-OMPA (tetra(monoisopropyl)pyrophosphorotetramide) (36Ofek K. Krabbe K.S. Evron T. Debecco M. Nielsen A.R. Brunnsgaad H. Yirmiya R. Soreq H. Pedersen B.K. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Calculated BChE ATCh hydrolytic activity was defined as the total serum ability to hydrolyze ATCh after subtraction of AChE hydrolytic activity. For stability tests, serum-derived samples of genotyped KK, UK, and UU carriers, diluted 1:10 in saline, were incubated overnight in 0–2 m urea at 37 °C and electrophoretically separated (2 h, 4 °C) in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. This was followed by activity staining with 3.0 mm copper sulfate, 0.5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 10 mm sodium citrate, 1.6 mm S-butyrylthiocholine iodide, and 65 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at room temperature (37Karnovsky M.J. Roots L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1964; 12: 219-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar). Continuous data were summarized and displayed as mean ± S.D. Distributions of calculated BChE activities were assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Normality test. The difference between genotypes of mean calculated activities was evaluated using Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS for Windows (version 15.0, SPSS Inc.) software was used to carry out all statistical analyses. Peptides used were: Aβ1–40, (Sigma, Jerusalem, Israel), BSP-U and BSP-K, derived from the C-terminal sequences of human BChE (EC 3.1.1.8.) variants (U, GNIDEAEWEWKAGFHRWNNYMMDWKNQFNDYT; K, A6T), and the 17-mer poly-l-proline (PolyP) sequence (PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLP), derived from lamellipodin, which promotes the assembly of BChE into tetramers (20Li H. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). All peptides were purified to >90%, as validated by mass spectrometry analyses. The ProteOnTM XPR36 protein interaction array system (Bio-Rad, Haifa, Israel) was used to study the interaction of a recombinant full-length BChE (rBChE-U) and the peptides BSP-U and BSP-K, with a polyclonal antibody raised against rBChE-U (38Berson A. Knobloch M. Hanan M. Diamant S. Sharoni M. Schuppli D. Geyer B.C. Ravid R. Mor T.S. Nitsch R.M. Soreq H. Brain. 2008; 131: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The protein and peptides were immobilized on GLC chips (Bio-Rad) using standard amine coupling. Arbitrary units (resonance unit) values of binding to the chip were 6000, 900, and 600, respectively. The antibody, as analyte, was diluted serially in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.005% Tween 20 and injected at five concentrations (3.12–50 μg/ml). All interactions were carried out at 25 °C. Immobilized IgG was used as a reference for background subtraction. Peptides were dissolved in 60% d6-DMSO (Aldrich) in double distilled water with 0.03 weight percent NaN3 and measured at 29 °C. BSP samples were measured alone and with PolyP at a 4:1 molar ratio (verified by relative peak-ratios in NMR spectra). The pH was titrated to 5.10 ± 0.05 for all samples. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz DMX spectrometer operating at the proton frequency of 600.13 MHz, using a 5-mm selective probe equipped with a self-shielded xyz-gradient coil. The transmitter frequency was set on the hydrogen-deuterium exchange in water signal, which was calibrated at 4.735 ppm. total correlation spectroscopy, using the MLEV-17 pulse scheme for the spin lock (39Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (40Wagner R. Berger S. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1996; 123: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) experiments were acquired under identical conditions for all samples, using gradients for water saturation. The nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments were acquired with a mixing time of 200 ms. Spectra were processed and analyzed with the XWINNMR (Bruker Analytische Messtechnik GmbH) and SPARKY3 software. 4T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kueller, University of California, San Francisco, CA, personal communication. Zero filling in the F1 dimension and data apodization with a shifted squared sine bell window function in both dimensions were applied prior to Fourier transformation. The baseline was further corrected in the F2 dimension with a quadratic polynomial function. Resonance assignment followed the sequential assignment methodology developed by Wüthrich (41Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Oxidative photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (42Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) was used to study the effect of BSP peptides on Aβ oligomerization. Aβ was preincubated in hexafluoroisopropanol (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium), lyophilized and redissolved in double distilled water to a final concentration of 100 μm. Aβ was incubated alone or in the presence of 1 μm protein or peptides over 24 h at room temperature. Aliquots were removed at 0, 4, 7, 8, and 22 h and centrifuged (30 min, 14,000 rpm). Soluble fractions were treated as described previously (43Podoly E. Bruck T. Diamant S. Melamed-Book N. Weiss A. Huang Y. Livnah O. Langermann S. Wilgus H. Soreq H. Neurodegener. Dis. 2008; 5: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thioflavine T and bis-ANS fluorescence measurements and transmission electron microscopy were done as described (25Diamant S. Podoly E. Friedler A. Ligumsky H. Livnah O. Soreq H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 43Podoly E. Bruck T. Diamant S. Melamed-Book N. Weiss A. Huang Y. Livnah O. Langermann S. Wilgus H. Soreq H. Neurodegener. Dis. 2008; 5: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Direct CD spectra were recorded using a CD Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD) in 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes, Hellma 100-QS (Hellma GmbH & Co. KG, Mülheim/Baden, Germany). Recordings were at 0.1-nm intervals in a spectral range of 185–260 nm. The CD spectra were computationally deconvoluted, using the K2D analysis program (44Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). The concentration of BSP peptides was below the level of detection so that the spectra measured changes in Aβ only. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in a 1:1 mixture of minimal essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel) and Ham's modified medium F-12 (Sigma), with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel). Cells were plated in 24-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 105 cells/well in 500 μl of medium and allowed to attach overnight. Aβ was preincubated for 4 h, diluted 1:10 (final volume 500 μl) with phenol red-free RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing 10% serum, and added to the cells. Cell viability was determined using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays (45Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Hess B. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Academic Press, New York, NY1963: 736-743Google Scholar) as described (38Berson A. Knobloch M. Hanan M. Diamant S. Sharoni M. Schuppli D. Geyer B.C. Ravid R. Mor T.S. Nitsch R.M. Soreq H. Brain. 2008; 131: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The BChE genotype (Fig. 1, A and B) was determined using nucleated blood cell DNA from apparently healthy volunteers who also donated serum for hydrolytic activity measurements. The observed genotype distribution included 72.0% UU, 23.2% UK, and 4.4% KK variants, consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The corresponding mean calculated ATCh hydrolytic activities of serum BChE from these subjects were 1103.31 ± 219.34, 1031.16 ± 198.56, and 949.05 ± 203.47 (p = 0.011) (Fig. 1C). The decline in ATCh hydrolytic activity from heterozygous to homozygous carriers indicated gene dose dependence. The location of the A539T substitution in the C terminus, which is distant from the hydrolytic site of the enzyme, suggested that its impaired stability caused the reduced activity. To challenge this prediction, the inherent stability of BChE-U and BChE-K was compared by incubating serum samples from genotyped subjects in increasing concentrations of urea followed by native gel electrophoresis and activity staining (Fig. 2A). Both BChE-U and BChE-K are enzymatically active tetramers; however, the enzymatic activity of BChE-K tetramers was greatly reduced following incubation in 1 m urea, unlike BChE-U, which was resistant to this treatment. This suggested that the hydrolytic activity was rapidly lost once BChE-K tetramers disassemble. We investigated the structural origin for the instability of BChE-K by analyzing the corresponding 32-residue synthetic peptides, BSP-K and BSP-U, for their interaction with a polyclonal rabbit antibody elicited toward intact rBChE-U (46Huang Y.J. Huang Y. Baldassarre H. Wang B. Lazaris A. Leduc M. Bilodeau A.S. Bellemare A. Côté M. Herskovits P. Touati M. Turcotte C. Valeanu L. Lemée N. Wilgus H. Bégin I. Bhatia B. Rao K. Neveu N. Brochu E. Pierson J. Hockley D.K. Cerasoli D.M. Lenz D.E. Karatzas C.N. Langermann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13603-13608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated a dose-dependent interaction of anti-rBChE-U antibodies with rBChE-U and BSP-U (albeit less profoundly) but not with BSP-K (Fig. 2, B and C). Immunoglobulin G, which does not bind to the antibody against rBChE-U (Fig. 2D) served as an immobilized control employed as a subtractable “baseline” in all cases. Additionally, other injected proteins (e.g. RACK1) did not bind rBChE or the two peptides (data not shown). These results supported the concept of structural differences between these two peptides and suggested that distinct tetramerization capacities are involved. Interactions of BSP peptides were studied by incubating them with the synthetic PolyP peptide, which facilitates BChE tetramerization (20Li H. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NMR was used to follow both BSP peptides interactions with PolyP by tracking chemical shift deviations in the amide-aliphatic interactions (fingerprint region). Because PolyP fortunately has no amide protons (apart from one leucine), it does not appear in the fingerprint region of the BSP spectra. The spectrum of BSP-U was assigned based on total correlation spectroscopy and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra acquired under identical conditions and was the basis for assignments of both BSP peptides with 4:1 ratios of peptide to PolyP (see supplemental Figs. SF1–4: supplemental Fig. 1, BSP-U; supplemental Fig. 2, BSP-U+PolyP; supplemental Fig. 3, BSP-K; supplemental Fig. 4, BSP-K+PolyP). Deviations of amide chemical shifts of each peptide in interaction with PolyP versus the free state are summarized in Fig. 3. Upon adding PolyP, BSP-U showed mainly upfield chemical shift deviations, suggesting that the amide protons are more shielded in this variant when interacting with PolyP. The amide protons of BSP-K showed the opposite, except for residues His-15 and Arg-16, which were shielded, and Asn-2, Trp-24, and Tyr-31, which were deshielded in both peptides. The distinct interactions observed for these peptides with PolyP suggested inherent differences between their tetramerization potency, compatible with the reduced stability of BChE-K as compared with BChE-U. The C-terminal domains of both BChE dimers and monomers are relatively exposed to the surrounding environment, as modeled based on the tetrameric structure of AChE-S (Fig. 4A). Separate fractions of BChE dimers and monomers were used to compare the effects caused by these C termini. rBChE-U production in the milk of transgenic goats yielded primarily dimeric protein, with ∼10% monomeric fraction, as shown by mass spectrometry (46Huang Y.J. Huang Y. Baldassarre H. Wang B. Lazaris A. Leduc M. Bilodeau A.S. Bellemare A. Côté M. Herskovits P. Touati M. Turcotte C. Valeanu L. Lemée N. Wilgus H. Bégin I. Bhatia B. Rao K. Neveu N. Brochu E. Pierson J. Hockley D.K. Cerasoli D.M. Lenz D.E. Karatzas C.N. Langermann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13603-13608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Column chromatography was used to separate monomers from dimers. ThT fluorescence measurements showed that isolated fractions of highly purified rBChE-U monomers and dimers both attenuated fibril formation at a molar ratio of 1:100 to Aβ. However, monomeric and dimeric rBChE-U showed different durations of the lag and growth phases in the fibril formation process (Fig. 4C). Dimeric rBChE-U attenuated Aβ fibril formation more than the monomeric BChE and presented a longer lag time and 20% less fluorescent signal at the plateau (Fig. 4C and inset). Furthermore, calculating the rate of fibril formation revealed that recombinant BChE dimers (Fig. 4D), and yet more so, native BChE from human serum (Fig. 4E) attenuate this process, suggesting direct association of this rate with the number of enzyme subunits. Inversely, a bis-ANS response curve to rBChE interaction with Aβ showed an apparently similar time scale and sustained fluorescence signal, unlike the reduced signal in the thioflavin T tests (Fig. 4F), both supporting our working hypothesis. The distinct structural features of BSP-K could potentially impair its ability to modulate Aβ conversion to β-sheet conformation. This was ass"

DUBs are cysteine proteases (with the exception of JAMM family DUBs, which are metalloproteases) that catalyze the removal of ubiquitin (Ub) from Ub-modified proteins and for the processing of tandemly linked nascently translated Ub precursors (36Amerik A.Y.

Based on the structure of the active site and the mechanism of catalysis, DUBs are divided into five groups: UCHs, USPs, MJDs, OTUs, and JAMMs. Deconjugation of Ub-protein substrates is achieved either by removal of the entire Ub chain from the protein or by removal of individual or multiple ubiquitins from the chain in a process termed “editing.” Different DUBs exhibit preferences for mono and poly-Ub chains or for K48 or K63-based Ub-Ub linkages (40Kim J.H. Park K.C. Chung S.S. Bang O. Chung C.H. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). DUBs also specifically target a distinct and wide range of ubiquitinated proteins, displaying a diverse array of DUB-specific biological functions (37Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Three DUBs have been reported to interact with steroid hormone receptors. Two of these, 2A-DUB and USP22, are part of histone acetyltransferase complexes (pCAF complex and STAGA, respectively), and both enhance AR transcription by removing histone H2A monoubiquitination (41Zhao Y. Lang G. Ito S. Bonnet J. Metzger E. Sawatsubashi S. Suzuki E. Le Guezennec X. Stunnenberg H.G. Krasnov A. Georgieva S.G. Schüle R. Takeyama K. Kato S. Tora L. Devys D. Mol.

Haendler B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2005; 245: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in all these cases, the receptor itself has not been observed to be deubiquitinated. In this study we have identified OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1 (OTUB1) as an ERα-interacting DUB. OTUB1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that has known in vitro deubiquitinating activity and a preference for K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (44Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 45Edelmann M.J. Iphöfer A. Akutsu M. Altun M. di Gleria K. Kramer H.B. Fiebiger E. Dhe-Paganon S. Kessler B.M. Biochem.

However, no protein substrates that are deubiquitinated by OTUB1 have been identified in living cells. Here, we show that OTUB1 interacts with ERα, deubiquitinates the receptor in cells and in vitro, and represses its transcriptional activity in transient reporter assays as part of its negative regulation of ERα activity. OTUB1 also regulates endogenous ERα both by regulating the transcription of ERα gene in Ishikawa cells and by stabilizing ERα protein in the chromatin. The plasmid expression vectors pCR3.1-ERα, pCR3.1-FLAG-PR-B, pCR3.1-FLAG-ERα, pCR3.1-ERβ, pCR3.1-RAC3 (Src-3), and the reporter genes pERE-E1b-LUC, pGRE-E1b-LUC, and pG5-LUC were made and described before (28Lonard D.M.

Constructs expressing HA-OTUB1 and V5-OTUB1 were generated by inserting 5′ HA or 5′ V5 tag into pCMV6 (Origene) using a sequential PCR method with overlapping primers. We used pCMV6-OTUB1 (Origene) as a template for these reactions. pCMV6-HA-OTUB1 C/S and pCMV6-V5-OTUB1 Ubmut were constructed using a sequential PCR method and overlapping primers to generate point mutations and deletion fragments. Point mutants and fragments were subsequently subcloned into the pCMV6 vector. The same technology was used for construction of GAL4-AF2 (pBIND-EF) and pCR3.1-ERα179C. All of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Details of our cloning scheme as well as the primer sequences used are available upon request. For knockdown experiments, siRNA ON TARGET SMART POOL against human OTUB1 (catalog number L-021061-00) and the appropriate siRNA ON TARGET SMART CONTROL POOL (catalog number D001810-10-05) were purchased form Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). All of the cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or 10% charcoal-stripped serum for hormone treatment. For transient transfections, HeLa and HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For the transfection of Ishikawa cells, we used FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). For siRNA knockdown, the cells were transfected for 4 days with 50 nm of siRNA using TransientTKO (Mirus). Luciferase assays were performed with substrate purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations and Western blots were performed as described before using anti-FLAG or protein A beads (Invitrogen) and antibodies F10 and D12 (Santa Cruz) for ERα, anti-HA (Sigma), anti-FLAG (Affinity BioReagents), and rabbit and mouse control IgG (Santa Cruz). Antibody against human OTUB1 was custom produced and assayed by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. in rabbits using two synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal variable domain of human OTUB1 (QQKIKDLHKKYSYIRKT and KQEPLGSDSEGVNC). Ishikawa cells total RNA was extracted using Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad). The PR, GREB1, OTUB1, ERα mRNA, and the cyclophilin mRNA (as an internal control) were quantitated as in Yi et al. (47Yi P. Feng Q. Amazit L. Lonard D.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 465-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) by TaqMan-based reverse transcriptase PCR using the AIB1 Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan primer-probe sets for PR, GREB1, and OTUB1 were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The primers for the ERα mRNA are as follows: forward, 5′-GACAGGGAGCTGGTTCACATG; reverse, 5′-GGAGGGTCAAATCCACAAAGC; and probe, 5′-FAM-TGGCACCCTCTTCGCCCA-TAMRA. The primers for the cyclophilin mRNA were described previously (47Yi P. Feng Q. Amazit L. Lonard D.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 465-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For the purpose of analyzing deubiquitinating activity associated with ERα, ERα was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells transfected with pCR3.1-hERα or empty vector for 2 days or from MCF-7 cells. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) without protease inhibitors at 4 °C. The lysates were sonicated at low power (10% duty cycle, output 2, using a Branson sonifier 250) and spun down, and the supernatants precleared with protein A beads for 30 min. ERα antibody (2.5 μg of each F10 and D12) or normal mouse IgG (5 μg) was then added to supernatants and incubated for 2 h. Protein A beads (Invitrogen) were added for 1 h. Protein A beads were spun down and washed twice with 0.2% TBS with Tween 20 detergent and twice with TBS. The beads were then resuspended in 100 μl of ubiquitin-AFC reaction buffer (48Anderson C. Crimmins S. Wilson J.A. Korbel G.A. Ploegh H.L. Wilson S.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 1 mg bovine serum albumin. Finally, ubiquitin-AFC (Boston Biochem) was added at a concentration of 0.5 μm. A control reaction was pretreated for 5 min with 2 μm of ubiquitin-aldehyde (Boston Biochem) at 37 °C before the addition of ubiquitin-AFC. The reactions were incubated in the dark at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. Measurement of AFC release was performed by excitation at 405 nm and measured at an emission wavelength of 505 nm using a fluorescent plate reader. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Recombinant ERα (300 ng/reaction) from Invitrogen was in vitro ubiquitinated using Boston Biochem ubiquitination kit (catalog number K-960) and FLAG-ubiquitin (catalog number U-120). The ubiquitination reaction was then diluted to 400 μl with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors and ERα antibodies (2.5 μg of each F10 and D12; Santa Cruz) were added for 2 h. Protein A beads were then added for 1 h and washed afterward twice with 0.2% TBS with Tween 20 detergent and twice with TBS. The beads were then resuspended in deubiquitination reaction buffer: 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10% energy solution (Boston Biochem from K-960). Finally, 2 μg of recombinant purified GST-OTUB1 (Abgent) was added. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 4 h or overnight. Following incubation, 5× SDS loading buffer was added to the reaction and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG and Anti-ERα antibodies and chemiluminscence. Alkaline phosphatase assays were performed using an alkaline phosphatase kit from AnaSpec (71230). Ishikawa cells were transfected with siOTUB1 or a control siRNA pool as described above. E2 (100 nm) or ethanol was added to the cells 2 days after transfection for 48 h. The cells were then harvested and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Absorbance values were then normalized with a protein concentration that was determined by Bradford analysis (Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Nuclear and chromatin fractionations were performed according to the protocol published by Wysocka et al. (49Wysocka J. Reilly P.T. Herr W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In short, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in solution A (without Triton X-100). Triton X-100 0.1% (final) was then added to cells for 5 min on ice. The cells were spun down at 1300 × g for 4 min. Precipitate (P1) was washed with solution A without Triton X-100 and lysed using solution B for 10 min on ice. Lysate was then spun down at 1700 × g for 4 min, precipitate-washed (chromatin fraction) with solution B once, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The remaining chromatin was then resuspended in SDS loading buffer, sonicated, and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. Solution A contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Solution B contained 3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO3, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. The cells were transfected with ERα for 48 h and treated with E2 (1 nm) where indicated for 2 h. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and ERα was immunoprecipitated using ERα antibodies (F10 and D12; Santa Cruz) for 2 h and protein A beads (Invitrogen). The lysates were then run on SDS-PAGE. The whole gel was cut in five parts, trypsinized, and prepared for electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/liquid chromatography (ESI-LTQ) mass spectrometry. The peptides were identified using SeQuest software and the human RefSeq library. To determine whether DUBs are associated with ERα protein, complexes were immunoprecipitated from 293T cells transiently transfected with an ERα expression vector and incubated with a recombinant DUB substrate, ubiquitin-AFC. Fluorometry-detected release of the AFC moiety revealed that the ERα complex contains DUB activity (Fig. 1A). Next, we repeated this experiment using an endogenous ERα protein complex immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cells, indicating that DUBs are associated with the endogenous receptor as well (Fig. 1B). To identify the ERα-interacting DUB(s), ERα immunoprecipitated from the 293T cells was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ERα interacts in its unliganded state with OTUB1 (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). Subsequent immunoprecipitations and reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments of OTUB1 and ERα confirmed the mass spectrometry analysis, finding that OTUB1 binds ERα (Fig. 2, A and B). Next, we investigated whether ERα interaction with OTUB1 is dependent on the presence of E2. Because the receptor interaction with OTUB1 did not change in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2C), we concluded that the ERα-OTUB1 interaction is hormone-independent. Additionally, we tested whether OTUB1 would bind progesterone receptor B (PR-B). Under the same experimental conditions no observable binding of OTUB1 to PR-B was detected (Fig. 2D). Because OTUB1 is a DUB with confirmed in vitro deubiquitinating activity toward polyubiquitin chains (44Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we investigated whether OTUB1 can deubiquitinate ERα. To study this process we used wild type OTUB1 and two OTUB1 mutant molecules: a catalytically inactive OTUB1 C/S and an OTUB1 Ubmut that cannot bind ubiquitin (Fig. 3A). A catalytically inactive OTUB1 (OTUB1-C/S) expression vector was constructed by substituting active site cysteine 91 to serine (44Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Balakirev et al. (44Balakirev M.Y. Tcherniuk S.O. Jaquinod M. Chroboczek J. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) identified two conserved OTUB1 domains capable of binding ubiquitin: an UIM domain located immediately next to the active site and an UBA-like domain located toward the C terminus of the molecule. In the UIM domain we substituted conserved alanine, serine, and glutamate residues to glycine, alanine, and alanine, respectively. In the same molecule we deleted the other UBA-like domain to create an OTUB1 protein that cannot interact with ubiquitin (OTUB1 Ubmut) (Fig. 3A). We examined ERα ubiquitination in HEK293T cells in the presence of overexpressed wild type OTUB1 or OTUB1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 3B (first two lanes) overexpression of OTUB1 substantially reduced slower migrating ubiquitinated ERα species. The expression of catalytically inactive OTUB1 (OTUB1-C/S) restored ERα ubiquitin levels (Fig. 3B, third lane), indicating that deubiquitination of ERα by OTUB1 is dependent on OTUB1 catalytic activity. The expression of the OTUB1 Ubmut that is incapable of ubiquitin binding further increased the amount of ubiquitinated ERα (Fig. 3B, fourth lane), suggesting that the OTUB1 Ubmut may act as a dominant negative with respect to receptor deubiquitination. Interestingly, we observed that mutation of a single conserved residue in the catalytic site of OTUB1 significantly decreased the interaction of OTUB1 with ERα (Fig. 3B, compare second lane and third lane), indicating that the active site cysteine plays an essential role as a substrate-interacting surface. More surprisingly, we found that the ubiquitin-binding mutant OTUB1 Ubmut bound ERα substantially more strongly than the wild type OTUB1 (Fig. 3B, compare second and fourth lane). This finding is significant because it shows that ubiquitin binding is not necessary for a deubiquitinating enzyme to recognize and bind its substrate. Analysis of the crystal structure of human OTUB1 (45Edelmann M.J. Iphöfer A. Akutsu M. Altun M. di Gleria K. Kramer H.B. Fiebiger E. Dhe-Paganon S. Kessler B.M. Biochem. J. 2008; 418: 379-390Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar) suggests that OTUB1 is catalytically inactive in an unliganded state (in the absence of K48-linked chains). We speculate that because the OTUB1 Ubmut cannot recognize ubiquitin chains, it remains auto-inhibited and unable to release ERα. To show that OTUB1 is capable of deubiquitinating ERα in vitro, we ubiquitinated recombinant ERα under cell-free conditions using an in vitro ubiquitin kit consisting of ubiquitin-activating, conjugating, and E3 ligase enzymes (Boston Biochem). This ubiquitinated ERα was then incubated with recombinant purified GST-OTUB1. As shown in Fig. 3C recombinant GST-OTUB1 is capable of deubiquitinating ERα in vitro. To examine the potential role of OTUB1 in ERα-mediated transcription, we performed ERE-LUC reporter ass"
https://openalex.org/W2115044497,"One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 538G>A (Gly180Arg), in the ABCC11 gene determines the type of earwax. The G/G and G/A genotypes correspond to the wet type of earwax, whereas A/A corresponds to the dry type. Wide ethnic differences exist in the frequencies of those alleles, reflecting global migratory waves of the ancestors of humankind. We herein provide the evidence that this genetic polymorphism has an effect on the N-linked glycosylation of ABCC11, intracellular sorting, and proteasomal degradation of the variant protein. Immunohistochemical studies with cerumen gland-containing tissue specimens revealed that the ABCC11 WT protein was localized in intracellular granules and large vacuoles, as well as at the luminal membrane of secretory cells in the cerumen gland, whereas granular or vacuolar localization was not detected for the SNP (Arg180) variant. This SNP variant lacking N-linked glycosylation is recognized as a misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and readily undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which determines the dry type of earwax as a mendelian trait with a recessive phenotype. For rapid genetic diagnosis of axillary osmidrosis and potential risk of breast cancer, we developed specific primers for the SmartAmp method that enabled us to clinically genotype the ABCC11 gene within 30 min."

They select their substrates primarily by recognizing sequence motifs or covalent modifications. Once a substrate is bound to the protease, it has to be unfolded and translocated into the proteolytic chamber to be degraded. Some proteases appear to be promiscuous, degrading substrates with poorly defined targeting signals, which suggests that selectivity may be controlled at additional levels. Here we compare the abilities of representatives from all classes of ATP-dependent proteases to unfold a model substrate protein and find that the unfolding abilities range over more than 2 orders of magnitude. We propose that these differences in unfolding abilities contribute to the fates of substrate proteins and may act as a further layer of selectivity during protein destruction.

We propose that these differences in unfolding abilities contribute to the fates of substrate proteins and may act as a further layer of selectivity during protein destruction. Energy-dependent proteolysis is responsible for more than 90% of the protein turnover inside the cell (1.Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This process both removes misfolded and aggregated proteins as part of the response of the cell to stress and controls the concentrations of regulatory proteins (2.Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles, energy-dependent proteases fall into five classes as follows: ClpAP, ClpXP, Lon, HslUV (also referred to as ClpYQ), and HflB (also referred to as FtsH). In Archaea, analogous functions are performed by the archaebacterial proteasome, consisting of the proteasome-activating nucleotidase (PAN), 3The abbreviations used are: PANproteasome-activating nucleotidaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseDTTdithiothreitolATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).3The abbreviations used are: PANproteasome-activating nucleotidaseDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseDTTdithiothreitolATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). working with the 20 S proteasome (4.Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); in the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotes, these same functions are performed by the 26 S proteasome (5.Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These different proteases show little sequence conservation outside the ATP-binding domains, but they share their overall architecture. They all form oligomeric, barrel-shaped complexes composed of one or more rings with the active sites of proteolysis sequestered inside a central degradation chamber (6.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Access channels to these sites are narrow, and proteins have to be unfolded to gain entry (6.Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Regulatory particles belonging to the AAA family of molecular chaperones assemble on either end of the proteolytic chamber and recognize substrates destined for degradation. After recognition, the regulatory particles translocate the substrate through a central channel to the proteolytic chamber and in doing so unravel folded domains within the substrate. Translocation and unfolding are driven by ATP hydrolysis by the regulatory particles, with conformational changes in the protease transmitted to the substrate by conserved residues in the loops lining the channel (7.Hinnerwisch J.

Protein degradation by AAA proteases is tightly regulated. Most proteins are targeted to ClpAP, ClpXP, HslUV, Lon, HflB, and PAN by sequence motifs in their primary structure (11.Flynn J.M.

Mori H. Matsuo E. Ito K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 47-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sometimes adaptor proteins recognize and bind sequence elements in substrates and deliver them to the protease, and other times the protease recognizes sequence elements directly (18.Levchenko I. Seidel M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Science. 2000; 289: 2354-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19.Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast, proteins are typically targeted to the 26 S proteasome through the covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains (20.Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. Embo J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, substrates appear to be selected for degradation based on the presence of specific recognition elements in the protein substrates. However, other mechanisms may also affect the specificity of degradation by prokaryotic proteases. Individual proteases recognize a wide range of targeting signals (11.Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 16.Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (For example, Escherichia coli ClpXP recognizes sequences belonging to five distinct classes of consensus sequences (11.Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and ClpAP, Lon, and FtsH can bind to unstructured regions in proteins with a wide range of amino acid sequences (21.Jubete Y. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30798-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22.Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 127: 931-937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).) One illustration of the loose specificity in targeting signals is the ability of a mitochondrial presequence to target proteins to the proteases ClpAP (24.Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and HslUV in vitro (see below). In addition, substrates are commonly acted upon by several different proteases in E. coli. For instance, proteins containing the 11-residue ssrA peptide at their C termini can be recognized by ClpAP, ClpXP, FtsH, Lon, and the archaebacterial proteasome (4.Benaroudj N. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25.Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Herman C. Thévenet D. Bouloc P. Walker G.C. D'Ari R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Choy J.S. Aung L.L. Karzai A.W. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6564-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, some substrates of Lon can be degraded by HslUV in vivo (28.Wu W.F. Zhou Y. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear how degradation remains selective despite the loose specificity of targeting signals. We propose that the intrinsic protein unfolding ability of AAA proteases and the stabilities of substrates against unfolding play a role in determining the fate of cellular proteins. For example, ClpXP releases hard-to-unfold substrates when it encounters them and degrades destabilized titin variants 20-fold faster than wild type titin (29.Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 1390-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound AAA protease FtsH has a weak unfolding ability, which allows this protease to act selectively on damaged and unfolded polypeptides (30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Here we find that the relative unfolding abilities of ATP-dependent proteases vary more than 100-fold and that the unfolding abilities of proteases belonging to the same class but originating from different species appear to be conserved. The unfolding abilities also seem to be intrinsic properties of the proteases themselves rather than other cytosolic factors, such as chaperones. Differences in protease unfolding abilities may contribute to substrate selectivity during protein degradation. For example, expression of a protease with a weak unfolding ability during a stress response could allow the selective elimination of unfolded, misfolded, or otherwise aberrant proteins and spare stable proteins from destruction (30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Protease substrates contained domains derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens barnase (31.Hartley R.W. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2367-2370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), B. amyloliquefaciens barstar (32.Hartley R.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 450-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), E. coli DHFR (33.Rood J.I. Laird A.J. Williams J.W.

N-terminal targeting signals for ClpAP or HslUV consisted of 65 amino acid extensions derived from the signal sequence of yeast cytochrome b2 (36.Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. Embo J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for PAN/20S of the first 65 residues of barnase, for ClpXP of the first 18 residues of the bacteriophage protein λO (37.Gonciarz-Swiatek M. Wawrzynow A. Um S.J. Learn B.A. McMacken R. Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Sliekers O. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

C-terminal targeting signals for ClpAP, ClpXP, FtsH, and PAN/20S contained the 11-residue ssrA peptide (15.Keiler K.C. Waller P.R. Sauer R.T. Science. 1996; 271: 990-993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for Lon and HslUV the E. coli cell division inhibitor protein SulA (169 amino acids) (28.Wu W.F. Zhou Y. Gottesman S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3681-3687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome substrates were targeted using N- or C-terminal fusions of the first 60 amino acids of the yeast Sic1 protein (39.Saeki Y. Isono E. Toh-E A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which was ubiquitinated in vitro as described below. In addition, a hexahistidine tag and a Strep-tag II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were appended to the termini to aid in purification. The simple sequence repeats are the same as those used previously for 26 S proteasome degradation experiments (40.Tian L. Holmgren R.A. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All constructs were made using standard molecular biology techniques in pGEM-3Zf (+) (Promega) or pET-3a (Novagen) vectors and verified by DNA sequencing. Radioactive fusion proteins were expressed from a T7 promoter by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in a reticulocyte extract (Promega), supplemented with [35S]methionine, and proteins were partially purified by high speed centrifugation and ammonium sulfate precipitation, as described (36.Matouschek A. Azem A. Ratliff K. Glick B.S. Schmid K. Schatz G. Embo J. 1997; 16: 6727-6736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments using fully purified substrates, His-tagged fusion proteins were purified from the translation mix using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic beads (Qiagen) following standard protocols as provided by the supplier. 26 S proteasome substrates were expressed in Rosetta (DE3)pLysS E. coli (Novagen) in EZ Rich Defined Media lacking methionine (Teknova) and supplemented with [35S]methionine and -cysteine. After cell lysis, protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and then on Strep-tactin resins using standard protocols (Qiagen), leading to single band on a Coomassie-stained gel. The substrates were then ubiquitinated in vitro at 25 °C for 2–3 h in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 μm DTT, 83 nm yeast E1 (Boston Biochem), 1 μm recombinant UbcH5a (Boston Biochem), 1.9 μm purified Rsp5 (39.Saeki Y.

E. coli ClpA and ClpX clones were the gift of Dr. Michael Maurizi (National Institutes of Health). ClpA was purified as described (41.Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ClpX was expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. After sonication and centrifugation, the soluble fraction was ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to remove membranes and cell debris, and the resulting soluble fraction was precipitated by adding (NH4)2SO4 to 40%. The pellet was resuspended and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer PS-A (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4). ClpX eluted halfway through a 100 to 0% (NH4)2SO4 gradient. Fractions containing ClpX were dialyzed, applied to a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a 0.1–1.0 m KCl gradient in buffer QS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). Fractions containing ClpX were loaded onto a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 0.1–0.5 m KCl gradient in buffer MQ (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). Eluates were estimated to be at least 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. ClpP was purified as described (41.Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Singh S.K. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 314-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Haemophilus influenzae HslUV in pRSET-B was a gift of Dr. David McKay (Stanford University). HslU and HslV were co-expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells for 2.5 h at 37 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Soluble lysate was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10% glycerol and eluted with a 0.1 to 0.4 m KCl gradient. Eluates containing both HslU and HslV were pooled and precipitated in 70% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The protein complex was further purified by gel filtration using an S-200 column (GE Healthcare). Eluates containing HslUV were pooled and applied to a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 10% glycerol and eluted with a 0.1 to 0.4 m KCl gradient. HslU and HslV were assessed >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. E. coli HslUV was PCR-amplified from E. coli strain DH5α, cloned into pRSET-B, and expressed and purified as described for H. influenzae HslUV. FtsH was purified as described previously (30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Clones of Methanococcus jannaschii PAN and Thermoplasma acidophilum 20 S were a gift of Dr. Christopher Hill (University of Utah). PAN and 20 S were purified essentially as described (42.Förster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P. Embo J. 2003; 22: 4356-4364Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). E. coli Lon was purified using a hexahistidine tag attached to the C terminus. Lon was PCR-amplified from E. coli strain DH5α, cloned into plasmid pQE-60 (Qiagen), and expressed in M15 cells. The expressed protein was purified as described (43.van Dijl J.M. Kutejová E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged mitochondrial Lon was expressed from plasmids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (43.van Dijl J.M. Kutejová E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); mitochondria were isolated from S. cerevisiae as described previously, and the histidine-tagged Lon was purified using previously published protocols. Yeast proteasome was purified as described previously (39.Saeki Y. Isono E. Toh-E A. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 399: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 30 °C unless otherwise noted. Protease was in excess of unfoldase (except for HslUV, where HslU and HslV were co-purified as a 1:1 complex) to prevent free unfoldase and 26 S proteasome, which was purified as an intact complex. ClpAP degradation assays were performed in a total of 50 μl of Clp degradation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2). 25 μl of substrate protein produced by in vitro translation (see above) were ammonium sulfate-precipitated and resuspended in 25 μl of pre-warmed degradation buffer. Degradation reactions were started by the addition of 10 μl of substrate to 40 μl of pre-warmed degradation buffer containing 4 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and either 0.1 μm ClpA6, 0.2 μm ClpP14 for the N-terminally targeted substrates, or 0.2 μm ClpA6, 0.4 μm ClpP14 for the C-terminally targeted substrates. Methotrexate (100 μm) was included in the reaction as indicated. At designated times 4-μl samples were transferred to 35 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to stop proteolysis. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electronic autoradiography. ClpXP degradation assays were performed under the same conditions as ClpAP degradation assays, except using 0.3 μm ClpX6 and 0.8 μm ClpP14. HslUV degradation assays were performed similarly to ClpXP degradation assays, but in 50 μl of HslUV degradation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) with 0.05 μm HslU6V6. Lon degradation assays were performed in a total of 50 μl of Lon assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm MgCl2) with 0.1 μm Lon6 for both N-terminal and C-terminal targeting signal. HflB degradation assays were performed as described (30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). PAN/20S degradation assays were performed in 50 μl of degradation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2) with 0.2 μm PAN6, 0.4 μm 20 S14. The 26 S proteasome degradation assays were conducted using purified yeast proteasome essentially as described previously (44.Prakash S. Inobe T. Hatch A.J. Matouschek A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Degradation was in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 5 mm ATP, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 10 μm α-casein (to inhibit free 20 S proteasome), 2 mm DTT, 10–80 nm proteasome, and 1–10 nm ubiquitinated substrate (with proteasome in excess of substrate). ATPase rates were measured by a coupled pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase assay (45.Bessman M. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 166-176Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46.Seifried S.E. Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13511-13514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 100-fold excess of α-casein. The concentration of the complexes carrying the proteolytic sites was set at 15-fold molar excess over the concentration of the ATPase complexes (ranging from 0.05 to 1 μm) for ClpAP, ClpXP, HslUV, and PAN/20S so that measurements reflected the ability of the ATPase-protease complex, not the free ATPase subunits (47.Joshi S.A. Hersch G.L. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 404-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm DTT, 200 μm NADH, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 23 μg/ml pyruvate kinase. Reactions (50 μl) were performed in triplicate at 30 °C. The ATP-dependent proteases ClpAP, ClpXP, PAN/20S, and the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome can unfold and degrade many stable proteins (24.Lee C.

In contrast, FtsH lacks a robust unfolding ability, and degradation by FtsH depends on spontaneous unfolding of its substrate proteins (30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A. Gross C.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 659-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that AAA proteases differ in their intrinsic abilities to unfold proteins. We propose that these differences may affect whether a protein with an appropriate targeting signal can be degraded. To compare the unfolding abilities of the various ATP-dependent proteases, we first tested whether their basic mechanisms of degradation are similar. ClpAP, ClpXP, FtsH, Lon, and the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome unfold and degrade their substrates sequentially along the polypeptide chains of the substrates, starting from the targeting signal (24.Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 30.Herman C. Prakash S. Lu C.Z. Matouschek A.

Chem. 2005; 386: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sequential degradation can occur in either the N- to C-terminal or the C- to N-terminal direction (53.Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 58.Hoskins J.R. Yanagihara K. Mizuuchi K. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), depending on the location of the targeting signal. We find that representatives from the remaining families of ATP-dependent proteases, namely the archaebacterial proteasome (PAN/20S) and HslUV, function similarly. We came to this conclusion by following the degradation of two-domain model substrates consisting of B. amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease barnase and mouse DHFR as well as either an N-terminal or C-terminal targeting tag (Fig. 1; supplemental Fig. 1). PAN/20S and HslUV degraded these substrates in an ATP-dependent and tag-specific manner (data not shown). Degradation of DHFR is inhibited when protein unfolding is prevented by the tightly binding ligand methotrexate (KD = 9.5 nm for methotrexate and DHFR (60.Rajagopalan P.T. Zhang Z. McCourt L. Dwyer M. Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1, b–e). Stabilizing DHFR by methotrexate in a substrate in which DHFR is inserted between barnase and the degradation tag protected both the DHFR and barnase from degradation and the fusion protein remained stable (Fig. 1, c and e). In contrast, when barnase was inserted between the degradation tag and DHFR, stabilizing DHFR no longer protected the barnase domain. Instead, the reaction yielded a partially degraded product (Fig. 1, b and d). Hence, we conclude that these proteases degrade their substrates sequentially in either an N- to C-terminal or C- to N-terminal direction, starting from the targeting signal. To compare the unfolding abilities of AAA proteases, we again followed the degradation of model proteins composed of appropriate targeting signals followed by a barnase and then a DHFR domain (Fig. 2a). The barnase domain was destabilized by mutagenesis in some experiments so that all proteases were able to unfold and degrade the domain completely. The stability of the DHFR domain was adjusted by changing assay temperature or by replacing mouse DHFR with the more stable E. coli DHFR (ΔGunfolding = 6.1 kcal mol−1 for E. coli DHFR and ΔGunfolding = 4.4 kcal mol−1 for mouse DHFR (61.Endo T. Schatz G. Embo J. 1988; 7: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 62.Iwakura M. Nakamura T. Yamane C. Maki K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). Thus, as the proteases encountered the DHFR domain, some of the time they would succeed in unfolding the DHFR domain and degrade the substrate completely, and some of the time they would fail to unfold the DHFR domain, and the remainder of the substrate would dissociate to yield a partially degraded substrate (Scheme 1).SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The simplest mechanism for this reaction is described by Scheme 1, where S represents the two-domain substrate consisting of barnase and DHFR; E is the protease; S.E is the substrate-protease complex; I is the substrate intermediate containing folded DHFR domain; P is the product (i.e. peptides); kdeg is the rate constant by which the intermediate I is degraded to peptides; krel is the rate constant with which the intermediate dissociates from the protease, and k−rel is the rate constant with which the intermediate"
https://openalex.org/W2090583755,"Premature intracellular activation of the digestive enzyme trypsinogen is considered to be the initiating event in pancreatitis. However, the direct consequences of intracellular trypsin activity have not previously been examined. In the current study, a mutant trypsinogen (paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE)-trypsinogen), which is activated intracellularly by the endogenous protease PACE, was developed. This new construct allowed for the first time direct examination of the effects of intracellular trypsin on pancreatic acinar cells. We found that PACE-trypsinogen was expressed in the secretory pathway and was activated within acinar cells. Expression of PACE-trypsinogen induced apoptosis of HEK293 cells and pancreatic acinar cells, as indicated by histology, DNA laddering, PARP cleavage, and caspase-3 activation. Cell death was blocked by the trypsin inhibitor Pefabloc but not by the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD, indicating that caspase-independent pathways were also involved. However, intracellular trypsin had no significant effect on the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB. In contrast, extracellular trypsin caused cell damage and dramatically increased NF-kappaB activity. These data indicate that localization of active trypsin determines its effects on pancreatic acinar cells. This new model will greatly improve our understanding of the role of active trypsin in pancreatitis and its associated inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2108850637,"Background Hypocatabolism of the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), making pharmacological activation of IDE an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, it has not been established whether the proteolytic activity of IDE can be enhanced by drug-like compounds. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the finding that ATP and other nucleotide polyphosphates modulate IDE activity at physiological concentrations, we conducted parallel high-throughput screening campaigns in the absence or presence of ATP and identified two compounds—designated Ia1 and Ia2—that significantly stimulate IDE proteolytic activity. Both compounds were found to interfere with the crosslinking of a photoaffinity ATP analogue to IDE, suggesting that they interact with a bona fide ATP-binding domain within IDE. Unexpectedly, we observed highly synergistic activation effects when the activity of Ia1 or Ia2 was tested in the presence of ATP, a finding that has implications for the mechanisms underlying ATP-mediated activation of IDE. Notably, Ia1 and Ia2 activated the degradation of Aβ by ∼700% and ∼400%, respectively, albeit only when Aβ was presented in a mixture also containing shorter substrates. Conclusions/Significance This study describes the first examples of synthetic small-molecule activators of IDE, showing that pharmacological activation of this important protease with drug-like compounds is achievable. These novel activators help to establish the putative ATP-binding domain as a key modulator of IDE proteolytic activity and offer new insights into the modulatory action of ATP. Several larger lessons abstracted from this screen will help inform the design of future screening campaigns and facilitate the eventual development of IDE activators with therapeutic utility."
https://openalex.org/W1999610158,"Microvilli (stereocilia) projecting from the apex of hair cells in the inner ear are actively motile structures that feed energy into the vibration of the inner ear and enhance sensitivity to sound. The biophysical mechanism underlying the hair bundle motor is unknown. In this study, we examined a membrane flexoelectric origin for active movements in stereocilia and conclude that it is likely to be an important contributor to mechanical power output by hair bundles. We formulated a realistic biophysical model of stereocilia incorporating stereocilia dimensions, the known flexoelectric coefficient of lipid membranes, mechanical compliance, and fluid drag. Electrical power enters the stereocilia through displacement sensitive ion channels and, due to the small diameter of stereocilia, is converted to useful mechanical power output by flexoelectricity. This motor augments molecular motors associated with the mechanosensitive apparatus itself that have been described previously. The model reveals stereocilia to be highly efficient and fast flexoelectric motors that capture the energy in the extracellular electro-chemical potential of the inner ear to generate mechanical power output. The power analysis provides an explanation for the correlation between stereocilia height and the tonotopic organization of hearing organs. Further, results suggest that flexoelectricity may be essential to the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity of non-mammalian hearing organs at high auditory frequencies, and may contribute to the ""cochlear amplifier"" in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1986231905,"Background Fetal growth restriction (FGR) followed by rapid weight gain during early life has been suggested to be the initial sequence promoting central adiposity and insulin resistance. However, the link between fetal and early postnatal growth and the associated anthropometric and metabolic changes have been poorly studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Over the first year of post-natal life, changes in body mass index, skinfold thickness and hormonal concentrations were prospectively monitored in 94 infants in whom the fetal growth velocity had previously been measured using a repeated standardized procedure of ultrasound fetal measurements. 45 infants, thinner at birth, had experienced previous FGR (FGR+) regardless of birth weight. Growth pattern in the first four months of life was characterized by greater change in BMI z-score in FGR+ (+1.26+/−1.2 vs +0.58 +/−1.17 SD in FGR−) resulting in the restoration of BMI and of fat mass to values similar to FGR−, independently of caloric intakes. Growth velocity after 4 months was similar and BMI z-score and fat mass remained similar at 12 months of age. At both time-points, fetal growth velocity was an independent predictor of fat mass in FGR+. At one year, fasting insulin levels were not different but leptin was significantly higher in the FGR+ (4.43+/−1.41 vs 2.63+/−1 ng/ml in FGR−). Conclusion Early catch-up growth is related to the fetal growth pattern itself, irrespective of birth weight, and is associated with higher insulin sensitivity and lower leptin levels after birth. Catch-up growth promotes the restoration of body size and fat stores without detrimental consequences at one year of age on body composition or metabolic profile. The higher leptin concentration at one year may reflect a positive energy balance in children who previously faced fetal growth restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2063926640,"A current challenge in biology is to understand the dynamics of protein circuits in living human cells. Can one define and test equations for the dynamics and variability of a protein over time? Here, we address this experimentally and theoretically, by means of accurate time-resolved measurements of endogenously tagged proteins in individual human cells. As a model system, we choose three stable proteins displaying cell-cycle-dependant dynamics. We find that protein accumulation with time per cell is quadratic for proteins with long mRNA life times and approximately linear for a protein with short mRNA lifetime. Both behaviors correspond to a classical model of transcription and translation. A stochastic model, in which genes slowly switch between ON and OFF states, captures measured cell-cell variability. The data suggests, in accordance with the model, that switching to the gene ON state is exponentially distributed and that the cell-cell distribution of protein levels can be approximated by a Gamma distribution throughout the cell cycle. These results suggest that relatively simple models may describe protein dynamics in individual human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2172052550,"Most parents experience their children's puberty as a dramatic change in family life. This is not surprising considering the dynamics of physical and psychosocial maturation which occur during adolescence. A reasonable question, particularly from the parents' perspective, is: when does this vibrant episode end and adulthood finally start? The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between puberty and the changes in sleep phase preferences during female maturation and adulthood by a cross-sectional survey. The results from 1'187 females aged 5 to 51 years based on self-report measures of sleep preferences on weekdays and on free days as well as the occurrence of menarche, show that in contrast to prepubertal children, adolescent females exhibit a striking progression in delaying their sleep phase preference until 5 years after menarche. Thereafter, the sleep phase preference switches to advancing. The current study provides evidence that a clear shift in sleep-wake cycles temporally linked to menarche heralds the beginning of ""adult-like"" sleep-wake behaviour in women and can be used as a (chrono)biological marker for the onset of adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2126676464,"Oxidative stress is an important contributor to cancer development. Consistent with that, antioxidant enzymes have been demonstrated to suppress tumorigenesis when being elevated both in vitro and in vivo, making induction of these enzymes a more potent approach for cancer prevention. Protandim, a well-defined combination of widely studied medicinal plants, has been shown to induce superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and reduce superoxide generation and lipid peroxidation in healthy human subjects. To investigate whether Protandim can suppress tumor formation by a dietary approach, a two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis study was performed. At the end of the study, the mice on a Protandim-containing basal diet had similar body weight compared with those on the basal diet, which indicated no overt toxicity by Protandim. After three weeks on the diets, there was a significant increase in the expression levels of SOD and catalase, in addition to the increases in SOD activities. Importantly, at the end of the carcinogenesis study, both skin tumor incidence and multiplicity were reduced in the mice on the Protandim diet by 33% and 57% respectively, compared with those on basal diet. Biochemical and histological studies revealed that the Protandim diet suppressed tumor promoter-induced oxidative stress (evidenced by reduction of protein carbonyl levels), cell proliferation (evidenced by reduction of skin hyperplasia and suppression of PKC/JNK/Jun pathway), and inflammation (evidenced by reduction of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression, NF-κB binding activity, and nuclear p65/p50 levels). Overall, induction of antioxidant enzymes by Protandim may serve as a practical and potent approach for cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2019169759,"Glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy. A key question concerns the mechanism(s) by which the HIV-1 genome alters the phenotype of the highly specialized, terminally differentiated podocytes. Here, using an <i>in vitro</i> system of conditionally immortalized differentiated human podocytes (CIDHPs), we document a pivotal role for the p66ShcA protein in HIV-1-induced reactive oxygen species generation and CIDHP apoptosis. CIDHP transfected with truncated HIV-1 construct (NL4-3) exhibit increased reactive oxygen species metabolism, DNA strand breaks, and a 5-fold increase in apoptosis, whereas the opposite was true for NL4-3/CIDHP co-transfected with mu-36p66ShcA (mu-36) dominant negative expression vector or isoform-specific p66-small interfering RNA. Phosphorylation at Ser-36 of the wild type p66ShcA protein, required for p66ShcA redox function and inhibition of the potent stress response regulator Foxo3a, was unchanged in mu-36/NL4-3/CIDHP but increased in NL4-3/CIDHP. Acute knockdown of Foxo3a by small interfering RNA induced a 50% increase in mu-36/NL4-3/CIDHP apoptosis, indicating that Foxo3a-dependent responses promote the survival phenotype in mu-36 cells. We conclude that inhibition of p66ShcA redox activity prevents generation of HIV-1 stress signals and activation of the CIDHP apoptosis program."
https://openalex.org/W2038700378,"Background It has recently been postulated that the value humans place on rarity could cause the extinction of rare species. This is because people are willing to pay the high costs of exploiting the last individuals. Many hobbies, such as ecotourism or the keeping of exotic pets may cause this effect – known as the anthropogenic Allee effect. However, the entire theory relies on the insofar undemonstrated assumption that people do value rarity. Methodology/Principal Findings In order to quantify how much people valued rare species relative to common ones, we created online slideshows of photographs of either rare or common species on an Internet web site. The slideshow with photographs of rare species attracted more visitors, and visitors spent, in general, more time waiting to view it. Conclusions/Significance We provide evidence that people value rare more than common species. As we did not target consumers of a specific market, this finding suggests that the anthropogenic Allee effect is likely be driven by a large part of the population. Given the substantial participation in our online experiment, we highlight the potential of the world wide web resource as a tool for conservation action. However, the evidence presented here that the general public value rare species, combined with the assumption that anthropogenic Allee effect is operating, implies that conservationists should be prudent when using rarity to promote conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2002527935,"With few exceptions the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered a continuous system of endomembranes within which proteins and ions can move. We have studied dynamic structural changes of the ER in hippocampal neurons in primary culture and organotypic slices. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to quantify and model ER structural dynamics. Ultrastructure was assessed by electron microscopy. In live cell imaging experiments we found that, under basal conditions, the ER of neuronal soma and dendrites was continuous. The smooth and uninterrupted appearance of the ER changed dramatically after glutamate stimulation. The ER fragmented into isolated vesicles in a rapid fission reaction that occurred prior to overt signs of neuronal damage. ER fission was found to be independent of ER calcium levels. Apart from glutamate, the calcium ionophore ionomycin was able to induce ER fission. The N-methyl, D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist MK-801 inhibited ER fission induced by glutamate as well as by ionomycin. Fission was not blocked by either ifenprodil or kinase inhibitors. Interestingly, sub-lethal NMDA receptor stimulation caused rapid ER fission followed by fusion. Hence, ER fission is not strictly associated with cellular damage or death. Our results thus demonstrate that neuronal ER structure is dynamically regulated with important consequences for protein mobility and ER luminal calcium tunneling."
https://openalex.org/W1967601983,"11-cis-Retinol has previously been shown in physiological experiments to promote dark adaptation and recovery of photoresponsiveness of bleached salamander red cones but not of bleached salamander red rods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct interaction of 11-cis-retinol with expressed human and salamander cone opsins, and to determine by microspectrophotometry pigment formation in isolated salamander photoreceptors. We show here in a cell-free system using incorporation of radioactive guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate into transducin as an index of activity, that 11-cis-retinol inactivates expressed salamander cone opsins, acting an inverse agonist. Similar results were obtained with expressed human red and green opsins. 11-cis-Retinol had no significant effect on the activity of human blue cone opsin. In contrast, 11-cis-retinol activates the expressed salamander and human red rod opsins, acting as an agonist. Using microspectrophotometry of salamander cone photoreceptors before and after bleaching and following subsequent treatment with 11-cis-retinol, we show that 11-cis-retinol promotes pigment formation. Pigment was not formed in salamander red rods or green rods (containing the same opsin as blue cones) treated under the same conditions. These results demonstrate that 11-cis-retinol is not a useful substrate for rod photoreceptors although it is for cone photoreceptors.

These data support the premise that rods and cones have mechanisms for handling retinoids and regenerating visual pigment that are specific to photoreceptor type. These mechanisms are critical to providing regenerated pigments in a time scale required for the function of these two types of photoreceptors. 11-cis-Retinol is the precursor to 11-cis-retinal, the 11-cis-aldehyde form of vitamin A and the chromophore that combines covalently with rod and cone opsin proteins to form visual pigments. 11-cis-Retinal is consumed during visual signaling, and its continual synthesis is required. Photon absorption by the visual pigments causes the isomerization of its chromophore to the all-trans configuration. This initiates two processes critical for vision: activation of the photoreceptor cell and the eventual recovery of the original photosensitivity of the cells, requiring regeneration of the visual pigments. As cones are used for bright light vision, these two processes must work more rapidly in cones than in rods and thus cones have a higher requirement of 11-cis-retinoids as suggested by Rushton (1Rushton W.A.H. J. Physiol. 1968; 198: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 2Rushton W.A.H. Henry G.H. Vision Res. 1968; 8: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor activation begins with photoisomerization of the chromophore within the visual pigment. This results in a subsequent conformational change of the protein part of the visual pigment that is able to activate its G protein transducin, which in turn activates a PDE that lowers the concentration of cGMP and closes cGMP-gated ion channels. These steps comprise the visual signal transduction cascade (see Ref. 3Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2005; 48: 387-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar for review). The visual cycle involves regeneration of the visual pigment, which ultimately deactivates the protein and accomplishes the recovery of the photosensitivity of the photoreceptor cell. Classically, this process involves both the photoreceptor cell and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 4The abbreviations used are: RPEretinal pigment epitheliumGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid.4The abbreviations used are: RPEretinal pigment epitheliumGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. After photoisomerization of the chromophore and formation of the active visual pigment, all-trans-retinal is released from the opsin and reduced to all-trans-retinol, which is then transported to the RPE where it is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol through a number of steps. In the RPE, 11-cis-retinol is oxidized to the aldehyde form, which is transported back to the photoreceptor cell and can be directly used by all of the opsins to regenerate an inactive pigment ready for photoactivation. The details of this model have been extensively reviewed (4McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 5Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2004; 23: 307-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Alternatively, recent work suggests that cones have an additional source of 11-cis-retinoids from Müller cells (6Das S.R. Bhardwaj N. Kjeldbye H. Gouras P. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Mata N.L. Radu R.A. Clemmons R.C. Travis G.H.

Bhardwaj N. Kjeldbye H. Gouras P. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Unlike in the RPE cells, 11-cis-retinol is not oxidized to 11-cis-retinal in Müller cells. retinal pigment epithelium guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. retinal pigment epithelium guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. Jones et al. (9Jones G.J. Crouch R.K. Wiggert B. Cornwall M.C. Chader G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrated that administration of 11-cis-retinol to bleached salamander red cones could restore photosensitivity. A logical conclusion was that red cones were able to oxidize 11-cis-retinol to the aldehyde and regenerate visual pigments although noncovalent binding of 11-cis-retinol to red cone opsins generating a light-sensitive complex could not be excluded. On the other hand, 11-cis-retinol does not restore photosensitivity to bleached salamander rod cells but appears to directly activate the cells (9Jones G.J. Crouch R.K. Wiggert B. Cornwall M.C. Chader G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Kefalov V.J. Crouch R.K. Cornwall M.C. Neuron. 2001; 29: 749-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The data suggested that the rods were not able to oxidize 11-cis-retinol, but that the retinol itself could activate the signal transduction cascade, and indeed we recently demonstrated that 11-cis-retinol acts as an agonist to expressed bovine rod opsin (11Kono M. Goletz P.W. Crouch R.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our aim here was to study the action of 11-cis-retinol on cone opsins and cone photoreceptor cells to determine the efficacy of an alternate visual cycle for cones. The photoreceptor cells used in this study are from tiger salamander, and the expressed opsins used for biochemical experiments are those from salamander and human. Photoreceptor cells are generally identified by cell morphology and the type of opsin it contains that can be further complicated by the findings that some cone cells have multiple opsins (12Applebury M.L. Antoch M.P. Baxter L.C. Chun L.L.Y. Falk J.D. Farhangfar F. Kage K. Krzystolik M.G. Lyass L.A. Robbins J.T.

Recently genetic analysis has determined that opsins fall into five classes (reviewed in Refs. 14Ebrey T. Koutalos Y. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 49-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar and 15Yokoyama S. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We have studied opsins falling into four of these classes and use common color-derived names for the opsins and photoreceptor cells. The classic rod cells used for scotopic vision contain rhodopsin, the visual pigment for the rod opsin (RH1 opsin) and appeared red and thus have been designated as red rods. Some species such as salamanders have an additional rod cell whose photosensitivity is blue-shifted from that of the red rod and thus designated as green rods. In the tiger salamander, the green rods contain the identical opsin (SWS2 opsin) found in blue cones (16Ma J. Znoiko S. Othersen K.L. Ryan J.C. Das J. Isayama T. Kono M. Oprian D.D. Corson D.W. Cornwall M.C. Cameron D.A. Harosi F.I. Makino C.L. Crouch R.K. Neuron. 2001; 32: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The human blue cones contain an opsin from a different class (SWS1 opsin), which is homologous to the salamander UV cone opsin. The human red and green and salamander red cone opsins all belong to the same class of opsins (M/LWS opsins). Absorption properties of visual pigments are further modulated in some animals including the tiger salamander by use of 11-cis-retinal with an additional double bond (3,4-dehydro or A2 11-cis-retinal) resulting in red-shifted absorbance from pigments containing 11-cis-retinal (A1 11-cis-retinal). We show here that 11-cis-retinol is not an agonist to cone opsins and does not itself generate a light-sensitive opsin. We further show using microspectrophotometry that both red and blue salamander cone cells regenerate visual pigments from 11-cis-retinol, whereas pigments could not be regenerated with 11-cis-retinol in bleached salamander red and green rods even though the latter contains the same opsin as the salamander blue cone. Thus, rods and cones have mechanisms for handling retinoids and regenerating visual pigment that are specific to photoreceptor type, and these mechanisms are critical to providing regenerated pigments in a time scale required for the function of these two types of photoreceptors. The retinoids used in this study, the A1 forms of 11-cis-retinal and 11-cis-retinol, were synthesized and purified as described (for review, see Ref. 17Crouch R.K. Kefalov V. Gärtner W. Cornwall M.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 29-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purity of retinoids was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (18Moiseyev G. Crouch R.K. Goletz P. Oatis Jr., J. Redmond T.M. Ma J.X. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2229-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Larval tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) were purchased from the Charles D. Sullivan Company (Nashville, TN) and maintained, sacrificed, and processed to isolate intact photoreceptor cells as previously described (19Estevez M.E. Ala-Laurila P. Crouch R.K. Cornwall M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston University School of Medicine and in accordance with the standards set forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act. Cells were bleached on the microscope stage of the microspectrophotometer using a step of an unattenuated broad-band or “white” light. This light (duration 30–60 s) was provided from a tungsten-halogen light source (2.8 × 107 photons μm−2 s−1 at 500 nm) that was focused at the plane of the preparation. The extent of bleaching (>90% for all cell types) was confirmed by absorption spectroscopic measurements of single photoreceptor outer segments. This bleaching method taking place on the microscope stage had the advantage that it allowed spectral measurements from the same individual photoreceptor cell in the native state prior to bleaching as well as at different times after bleaching and following treatment with different retinoids. In some experiments, all cells in the sample were fully bleached prior to making the spectral measurements. Cells in a 3-cm plastic Petri dish were exposed to overlapping light spots (about 1 cm diameter) from two tungsten light sources focused at the sample plane for 10 min. One light spot consisted of short-wavelength light obtained by passing the beam through a wide-band interference filter (>70% transmittance at 400–470 nm). The second light beam consisted of long-wavelength light obtained by passing the beam through a wide-band interference filter (Kodak Wratten filter 25, >70% transmittance in the range 620–700 nm). Light from these two sources were used to selectively bleach blue and red cones, respectively. The estimates for the minimum fraction of visual pigment bleached, Fmin, were calculated according to the relation: Fmin = 1 − exp(−I Pλt), where I is the light intensity (photons μm−2 s−1), Pλ is the photosensitivity of the pigment (μm2), and t = the duration of the light exposure (s). We used an estimate of Pλ = 6 × 10−9 μm2 (20Jones G.J. Fein A. MacNichol Jr., E.F. Cornwall M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 483-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) for the peak photosensitivity of all rod and cone pigments studied. By microspectrophotometric measurements, we confirmed that this method bleached the visual pigment within the outer segment to the same extent (>90%) as did the bleaching that took place on the stage of the microspectrophotometer. For regeneration experiments, retinoids were supplied to bleached cells in Ringer solution containing 0.3% ethanol or in lipid vesicles as a retinoid carrier as described previously (21Cornwall M.C. Jones G.J. Kefalov V.J. Fain G.L. Matthews H.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 224-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to retinoids (final concentration 20–40 μm) by adding a small amount (100–500 μl) of concentrated (40–350 μm) retinoid stock solution to Ringer solution containing photoreceptor cells in the recording chamber. The absorption spectra from the outer segments of intact photoreceptors containing native pigment and after bleaching and addition of retinoid solutions were measured by a single-beam microspectrophotometer (22MacNichol Jr., E.F. Cool S.J. Smith E.L. Frontiers of Visual Science. Springer, Berlin1978: 194-208Google Scholar). The absorption spectra were recorded over the range of 380–740 nm at room temperature (21 °C) by procedures described earlier (23Cornwall M.C. MacNichol Jr., E.F. Fein A. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 1651-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mean optical density (OD) was calculated automatically by the acquisition software as OD = log (I0/It), where I0 is the transmitted light in a cell-free space adjacent to the photoreceptor cell and It is the transmitted light through the photoreceptor outer segment. Each spectral measurement on photoreceptor cells as well as baseline measurements consisted of 10 individual spectral scans that were averaged. In the experiments where visual pigment bleaching was performed prior to placing the cells on the microscope state, the sample was divided into three parts: dark-adapted cells containing native pigment, cells that were bleached and kept in Ringer solution, and cells that were bleached and treated with retinoids following bleaching to promote pigment regeneration. The absorption spectrum of each individual cell measured in the native state or following bleaching and exposure to retinoids was fitted by a sum of A1 and A2 visual pigment templates (24Govardovskii V.I. Fyhrquist N. Reuter T. Kuzmin D.G. Donner K. Vis. Neurosci. 2000; 17: 509-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The goodness of the fit was estimated based on least-square criteria in the following wavelength ranges: 390–705 nm (green rods and blue cones), 400–705 nm (red cones), and 450–705 nm (red rods). The following wavelengths of maximum absorbance for pure A1 and A2 pigments (λmax,A1 and λmax,A2) were used based on previous work (16Ma J. Znoiko S. Othersen K.L. Ryan J.C. Das J. Isayama T. Kono M.

The variation of peak ODs and A1:A2 ratios were characterized by calculating the S.E. based on template fitting to each individual spectrum. Salamander and human rod and cone opsins were expressed in COS cells as described previously (28Oprian D.D. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 301-306Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Das J. Crouch R.K. Ma J.X. Oprian D.D. Kono M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5532-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A discontinuous sucrose gradient was used to isolate the plasma membrane fraction (30Robinson P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 207-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kono M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ability of a given opsin to activate transducin was determined using a radioactive filter binding assay using membrane preparations of opsin expressed in COS cells as described previously (30Robinson P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 207-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kono M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Bovine rod transducin was purified from bovine retinas as described previously (32Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14963-14969Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To assay the ability of the opsin to activate transducin, we followed the increase of radioactive GTPγS bound to transducin with time after addition of retinoid in the dark or after illumination. Typically, our reaction mixture contained 1–10 nm opsin, 2.5 μm transducin, 3.0 μm GTPγS-35 (∼5 nCi/μl), 20 μm retinoid, 10 mm Mes, pH 6.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.4, at a final volume of 50, 100, or 150 μl. The buffer, opsin membranes, and transducin were first mixed. Retinoids were added from a ×50 stock dissolved in ethanol 1 min prior to addition of GTPγS, at which time the clock was started. At specified times, a 10-μl aliquot was transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter membrane attached to a vacuum manifold, washed (3 times) with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer; and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For light activation, samples were illuminated with either >530 nm (for rhodopsins and long wavelength-sensitive cone opsins) or >430 nm (for human and salamander blue cone opsins) light from a slide projector with a 300 watt bulb and long-pass filter for 12 s. The data illustrated in Fig. 1A show that 11-cis-retinol behaves as an agonist to salamander red rod opsin. Transducin activation by opsin in the presence of 11-cis-retinol is higher than in its absence. Activation by the apoprotein (open circles) occurs at a low level indicating a low level of basal activity at pH 6.4. Addition of 11-cis-retinal (filled triangles) lowers transducin activation consistent with published results (33Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Melia Jr., T.J. Cowan C.W. Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3182-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but subsequent exposure to light results in increased transducin activation due to photoactivation of the pigment. By contrast, exposure to 11-cis-retinol (filled circles) results in a roughly 5-fold elevation of transducin activation, which cannot be further incremented by light stimulation (λ > 530 nm) indicating that pigment had not been generated. These experiments were performed in a cell-free system that does not include an oxidoreductase capable of oxidizing 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. To compare the effectiveness of 11-cis-retinal and -retinol in promoting pigment regeneration in isolated salamander rods, we recorded the absorption spectra of individual salamander red rods before and after bleaching, and following exposure to exogenous 11-cis-retinoids (Fig. 1B). After a >90% bleach of the native visual pigment, the main peak at around 514 nm (gray filled circles) is substantially reduced (closed filled circles). The native salamander red rod pigment spectrum is consistent with about 70:30% mixture of A2 and A1 chromophore-based pigments as shown by the template (continuous gray line) fitted to the data. Following bleaching, there were no significant differences between the spectra recorded in the absence and presence of 11-cis-retinol (compare filled and open circles) indicating that red rods do not regenerate visual pigment or do so only at a very low rate in the presence of 11-cis-retinol. Pigment regeneration was obtained following exposure to 11-cis-retinal (filled triangles). This spectrum is blue-shifted compared with the native visual pigment, consistent with pigment regeneration based on A1 chromophore alone (λmax at 502 nm) (fitted black template: λmax,A1 = 502 nm, 0% A2 pigment). The mean peak OD of the regenerated pigment (0.157) was higher than that of the native pigment (0.136) consistent with the higher molar extinction coefficient of A1-based pigment compared with the A2-based pigment. The data illustrated in Fig. 2A show that 11-cis-retinol behaves as an inverse agonist to salamander red cone opsin. Transducin activation by opsin in the presence of 11-cis-retinol (filled circles) is lower than in its absence (open circles). These latter data are indistinguishable from those obtained following the addition of 11-cis-retinal (filled triangles). However, when exposed to light (λ > 530 nm), 11-cis-retinal-treated opsin activated transducin, as expected. The sample treated with 11-cis-retinol did not, indicating that the pigment had not been generated. As in Fig. 1A, these experiments were performed in a cell-free system that does not include an oxidoreductase capable of oxidizing 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. To compare the effectiveness of 11-cis-retinal and -retinol in promoting pigment regeneration in isolated salamander red cones, we recorded the absorption spectra of individual salamander red cones before (filled gray circles) and after bleaching (open circles), and following exposure to exogenous 11-cis retinoids (filled circles and filled triangles) (Fig. 2B and inset). Both 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinal are effective substrates for pigment regeneration. As shown in the main figure, the average unbleached pigment spectrum peaks at about 620 nm. As was the case for rod spectra illustrated in Fig. 1B, this spectrum reflects a mixture of A1- and A2-based visual pigments dominated by the A2 pigment. A new absorption band peaking at about 560 nm is obtained after 11-cis-retinol was added, consistent with the regeneration of native pigment with mostly the A1 form of 11-cis-retinal. These data were fitted with pigment template curves calculated with the same λmax,A1 and λmax,A2 values as in the native state but with a significantly higher A1 pigment content following treatment with 11-cis-retinol compared with the native state. Template fits to each individual spectrum give the following estimates for OD and A2% (mean ± S.E.): OD = 0.038 ± 0.002 (native) and 0.034 ± 0.001 (after 11-cis-retinol treatment); A2% = 87 ± 2 (native) and 34 ± 3 (after 11-cis-retinol treatment). The normalized absorption spectra obtained from cells bleached and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and 11-cis-retinol were indistinguishable (compare filled triangles and filled circles, Fig. 2B, inset) suggesting that the regenerated pigments in both cases were identical. Based on the fits, some A2 pigment was always present and may be due to a small amount of A2 retinoid remaining within the photoreceptor membranes that was available for pigment regeneration, or it may be due to photoregeneration of a small fraction of pigment upon by the intense bleaching light. Our data did not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. In some cells, bleaching and regeneration were repeated several times, and the resulting spectra showed reduced levels of A2 pigment with each cycle (data not shown). The data illustrated in Fig. 3 show that 11-cis-retinol does not behave as an agonist to the salamander green rod/blue cone opsin. Salamander blue cone and green rod visual pigments contain the same opsin (16Ma J. Znoiko S. Othersen K.L. Ryan J.C. Das J. Isayama T. Kono M. Oprian D.D. Corson D.W. Cornwall M.C. Cameron D.A. Harosi F.I. Makino C.L. Crouch R.K. Neuron. 2001; 32: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of transducin by the blue cone/green rod opsin is low (open circles), more consistent with the red rod opsin data (see Fig. 1A) and consistent with previous work (35Isayama T. Chen Y. Kono M. Degrip W.J. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Makino C.L. Vis. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The retinoid effect on transducin activation of this opsin is qualitatively consistent with the result obtained with red cone opsin: no increase (if anything a decrease) following treatment with both 11-cis-retinol (filled circles) and 11-cis-retinal (filled triangles). However, the effect is much less dramatic than in red cones as the blue cone opsin itself is less active (35Isayama T. Chen Y. Kono M. Degrip W.J. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Makino C.L. Vis. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the in vitro cell-free system has no oxidoreductase (see Figs. 1A and 2A), 11-cis-retinal, but not 11-cis-retinol treatment, results in the formation of visual pigment, making possible the light-dependent activation of transducin. Because in salamanders blue cones and green rods contain the same opsin (16Ma J. Znoiko S. Othersen K.L. Ryan J.C. Das J. Isayama T. Kono M. Oprian D.D. Corson D.W. Cornwall M.C. Cameron D.A. Harosi F.I. Makino C.L. Crouch R.K. Neuron. 2001; 32: 451-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we compared the effectiveness of 11-cis-retinal and 11-cis-retinol in promoting pigment regeneration in these photoreceptor cells. We recorded the absorption spectra of individual salamander blue cones and green rods before and after bleaching, and following exposure to exogenous 11-cis-retinoids (Fig. 3, B and C). The filled gray circles in Fig. 3B illustrate the native blue cone visual pigment spectrum. Following bleaching (open circles), most of the native blue cone pigment disappeared, with only a small fraction of the native pigment or bleaching products remaining. As in red-sensitive cones, exposure to 11-cis-retinol (filled circles) resulted in regeneration of mainly A1-based visual pigment. The normalized absorption spectra obtained from cells bleached and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and 11-cis-retinol were indistinguishable (Fig. 3B, inset) suggesting that the regenerated pigments in both cases were identical. With salamander green rods, similar experiments were performed (Fig. 3C) except we waited longer to obtain the final bleached spectrum. Representative data from a single cell are shown. The native pigment spectrum is illustrated by the gray filled circles. Among all native cells studied, we obtained the following results (mean ± S.E.): A2% = 35 ± 19 and OD = 0.095 ± 0.017 shown by the pigment template (continuous gray line). It should be noted that the λmax values of pure A1 and A2 pigment spectra of"

Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4218) Google Scholar). InsP3 subsequently binds to the InsP3R and induces channel opening. This pathway represents a major mechanism for Ca2+ liberation from ER stores (5Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar). All three InsP3R isoforms are dynamically regulated by cytosolic factors in addition to InsP3 (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is perhaps the most important determinant of InsP3R activity besides InsP3 itself and is known to regulate InsP3R both positively and negatively (6Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). ATP, in concert with InsP3 and Ca2+, also regulates InsP3R as do numerous kinases, phosphatases, and protein-binding partners (7Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

This intricate network of regulation allows InsP3R activity to be finely tuned by the local cytosolic environment (9Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As a result, InsP3-induced Ca2+ signals can exhibit a wide variety of spatial and temporal patterns, which likely allows Ca2+ to control many diverse cellular processes. InsP3 receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate InsP3-induced Ca2+ release open probability ryanodine receptor glutathione S-transferase wild type endoplasmic reticulum 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate.

Modulation of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (IICR) by ATP and other nucleotides provides a direct link between intracellular Ca2+ signaling and the metabolic state of the cell. Metabolic fluctuations could, therefore, impact Ca2+ signaling in many cell types given that InsP3R are expressed in all cells (11Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, ATP has been shown to augment IICR in many diverse cell types including primary neurons (13Kaplin A.I. Snyder S.H. Linden D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2002-2011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (14Iino M. J. Gen.

The effects of ATP on InsP3R function do not require hydrolysis because non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues are as effective as ATP (7Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 681-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ATP is thought to bind to distinct regions in the central, coupling domain of the receptors and to facilitate channel opening (2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 19Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP is not required for channel gating, but instead, increases InsP3R activity in an allosteric fashion by increasing the open probability of the channel in the presence of activating concentrations of InsP3 and Ca2+ (7Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Mak D.O. McBride S. Foskett J.K. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Despite a wealth of knowledge regarding the functional effects of ATP on InsP3R function, there is relatively little known about the molecular determinants of these actions. ATP is thought to exert effects on channel function by direct binding to glycine-rich regions containing the consensus sequence GXGXXG that are present in the receptors (2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These sequences were first proposed to be ATP-binding domains due to their similarity with Walker A motifs (21Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). The neuronal S2+ splice variant of InsP3R1 contains two such domains termed ATPA and ATPB. A third site, ATPC, is formed upon removal of the S2 splice site (2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 22Wagner 2nd, L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ATPB site is conserved in InsP3R2 and InsP3R3, while the ATPA and ATPC sites are unique to InsP3R1. Our prior work examining the functional consequences of mutating these ATP-binding sites has yielded unexpected results. For example, mutating the ATPB site in InsP3R2 completely eliminated the enhancing effects of ATP on this isoform while mutating the analogous site in InsP3R3 failed to alter the effects of ATP (23Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This indicated the presence of an additional locus for ATP modulation of InsP3R3. In addition, mutation of the ATPC in the S2− splice variant of InsP3R1 did not alter the ability of ATP to modulate Ca2+ release, but instead impaired the ability of protein kinase A to phosphorylate Ser-1755 of this isoform (22Wagner 2nd, L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ATPA and ATPB sites in InsP3R1 were first identified as putative nucleotide-binding domains after the cloning of the full-length receptor (24Furuichi T. Yoshikawa S. Miyawaki A. Wada K. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 1989; 342: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Early binding experiments with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP established that ATP cross-linked with receptor purified from rat cerebellum at one site per receptor monomer (19Maeda N. Kawasaki T. Nakade S. Yokota N. Taguchi T. Kasai M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1109-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later, more detailed, binding experiments on trypsinized recombinant rat InsP3R1 showed cross-linking of ATP to two distinct regions of the receptor that corresponded with the ATPA and ATPB sites (17Maes K. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smet P. Sienaert I. Waelkens E. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3492-3497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We and others (16Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Wagner 2nd, L.E.

It is widely accepted, in the context of the sequence similarity to Walker A motifs and biochemical data, that the ATPA and ATPB sites are the loci where ATP exerts its positive functional effects on InsP3R1 function (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P.

De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the higher affinity of the ATPA site to ATP is thought to confer the higher sensitivity of InsP3R1 to ATP versus InsP3R3, which contains the ATPB site exclusively (25Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Tu H. Wang Z. Nosyreva E. De Smedt H. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1046-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the contributions of the ATPA and ATPB sites to ATP modulation of the S2+ splice variant of InsP3R1. We compared the effects of ATP on InsP3R1 and on ATP-binding site mutated InsP3R1 using detailed functional analyses in permeabilized cells and in single channel recordings. Here we report that InsP3R1 is similar to InsP3R3 in that ATP modulates IICR even at maximal InsP3 concentrations and that neither the ATPA nor the ATPB site is required for this effect. An expression construct harboring cDNA for rat InsP3R1 was used as templates for mutagenesis. A two-step QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) mutagenesis strategy (27Wang W. Malcolm B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 37-43PubMed Google Scholar) was used to create the ΔATPA and ΔATPB mutants. The ATPA mutant was generated by introducing G5318C, G5324C, G5330C, G5333C, and G5339C point mutations and the ΔATPBB mutant was made by introducing G6047C, G6053C, and G6062C point mutations into the InsP3R1 cDNA. These mutations code for amino acid substitutions: G1773A, G1775A, G1777, G1778A, and G1780A for ΔATPA and G2016A, G2018, and G2021 for ΔATPB. Correct incorporation of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz, South Plainfield, NJ). Wild type and mutated InsP3R1 were linearized with NruI and introduced into DT40-3KO cells by nucleofection using solution T and program B23 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany). The cells were incubated in growth medium for 24 h prior to dilution in selection medium containing 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells were then seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at ∼1000 cells/well and incubated in selection medium for at least 7 days. Wells exhibiting growth after the selection period were picked for expansion. Measurements of ER luminal Ca2+ were performed essentially as described previously (22Wagner 2nd, L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J.

Methods. 2008; 46: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). InsP3R1-expressing stable DT40-3KO cells were loaded with 20 μm furaptra-AM (Teflabs, Austin, TX) at 39 °C for 30 min in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing 5.5 mm glucose, 137 mm NaCl, 0.56 mm MgCl2, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 mm CaCl2, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Furaptra-loaded cells were permeabilized by superfusion for 1–2 min with 40 μm β-escin in intracellular medium (ICM) containing 125 mm KCl, 19 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA (pH 7.3). Permeabilized cells were then washed in ICM without β-escin for 15 min to facilitate removal of cytosolic dye, and the cells were then superfused in ICM containing 1.4 mm MgCl2, Na2ATP, and 0.650 mm CaCl2 (free [Ca2+] of 200 nm, calculated using Maxchelator) to load the intracellular stores. The free [Ca2+] was subsequently maintained at a constant 200 nm throughout all experimental maneuvers. The free Ca2+ concentration was verified by fluorescent measurement of free Ca2+ in solutions. Prior to application of InsP3, the cells were superfused in ICM without MgCl2 for 1 min to disable SERCA activity. The unidirectional flux of Ca2+ upon InsP3 application was then monitored in the same solution containing various concentrations of InsP3 and ATP by monitoring the emission of the dye above 505 nm following excitation at 340 and 380 nm (exposure for 20 ms, once per second) using a TILL Photonics imaging system. Following removal of InsP3, refilling of the stores to allow repeated stimulations was accomplished by superfusion of ICM containing MgCl2 and ATP. Ca2+ release events were averages of the 30–50 cells in a field of view. Rates of Ca2+ release were estimated from these average responses by fitting the initial 30-s period of decreasing fluorescence to a single exponential function (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). Isolated DT40 nuclei were prepared by homogenization. Homogenization buffer (HB) contained 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 3 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5 with a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, Nutley, NJ). Cells were washed and resuspended in HB prior to nuclear isolation using a RZR 2021 homogenizer (Heidolph Instruments) with 25 strokes at 1200 rpm. 3 μl of nuclear suspension were placed in 3 ml of bath solution (BS), which contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 500 μm BAPTA, and 246 nm free Ca2+, pH 7.1. Nuclei were allowed to adhere to a plastic culture dish for 10 min. Single InsP3R1 currents were measured in the on-nucleus voltage clamp configuration using PClamp 9 and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (MDS Analytical Technologies, Toronto, Canada). Currents were measured at 20 kHz sampling rate and filtered at 5 kHz with a low-pass 4-pole bessel filter. Pipette solution (PS) contained 10 μm InsP3, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 100 μm BAPTA, 200 nm free Ca2+, and 0–5 mm ATP, pH 7.1. Measurements were made at −100 mV following establishment of a >5 GΩ seal. Data for current-voltage relationships were collected by stepping voltage from 0 mV to potentials between −100 and 100 mV in 10 mV increments. Typically, 1 out of every 5 patches contained reproducible single InsP3R1 channel activity. No activity was evident in patches from DT40-3KO nuclei under standard pipette conditions with 5 mm ATP (40 patches, 407 min of total recording time). Additionally, there was no single channel activity in nuclei from cells expressing InsP3R1 in the absence of InsP3 in the recording pipette (37 patches, 412 min of total recording time). Analyses were performed using the event detection protocol in Clampfit 9. Channel openings were detected by half-threshold crossing criteria. We assumed that the number of channels in any particular patch is represented by the maximum number of discrete stacked events observed during the experiment. Even at low Po, stacking events were evident (data not shown). Only patches with 1 apparent channel were considered for analysis of open probability, and mean open and closed times. The slope conductances were determined from the linear fits of the current-voltage relationships where g = Ik/(V − Vk). Equation parameters were estimated using a non-linear, least squares algorithm. We generated a DT40 triple knock-out (DT40-3KO) cell line stably expressing the rat S2+ InsP3R1 splice isoform (DT40-InsP3R1) containing only the putative ATPA and ATPB sites, to study the effects of ATP on this isoform expressed in isolation. These cells allow the unambiguous examination of isoform-dependent InsP3R function because all three endogenous InsP3R isoforms have been deleted via homologous recombination (29Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stable cell lines harboring mutated receptors allow the examination of the effects of removing putative sites for modulation (28Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Won J.H. Yule D.I. Methods. 2008; 46: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We employed ER calcium measurements in permeabilized DT40-InsP3R1 cells to examine the effect of ATP on IICR in the presence of various InsP3 and ATP concentrations. Similar to other cell lines expressing predominantly InsP3R1 (16Maes K. Missiaen L. De Smet P. Vanlingen S. Callewaert G. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Cell Calcium. 2000; 27: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and DT40 cells expressing chicken InsP3R1 in isolation (30Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), ATP clearly potentiates IICR in DT40-InsP3R1 cells (Fig. 1). Ca2+ release rates were measured over a range of InsP3 concentrations in the presence or absence of 5 mm ATP. As shown in Fig. 1, ATP was required for the maximal rate of IICR in DT40-InsP3R1 cells. This effect of ATP on IICR from InsP3R1 is similar to results obtained from DT40 cells expressing rat InsP3R3 in isolation, but distinctly different from cells expressing InsP3R2 (23Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). While InsP3R1 and InsP3R3 are regulated by ATP at maximal InsP3 concentrations, InsP3R2 is only modulated by ATP at submaximal InsP3. Our prior results also established that InsP3R2 was more sensitive to ATP than InsP3R3 (23Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine how InsP3R1 compared with the other two isoforms in this regard, we next determined the sensitivity of InsP3R1 to ATP modulation by stimulating IICR at a set InsP3 concentration over a range of ATP concentrations. Under these conditions, ATP increased InsP3R1 activity with an EC50 of ∼150 μm (Fig. 2). The sensitivity of InsP3R1 to ATP is therefore lower than that of InsP3R2, but higher than that of InsP3R3. The ATPB site is the only ATP-binding site conserved in all three mammalian InsP3R isoforms (2Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Even though this site is conserved in InsP3R2 and InsP3R3, the effects of mutating the sites in these isoforms were dramatically different. Abrogation of the ATPB site in InsP3R2 eliminated the enhancing effects of ATP, but ATP was able to modulate InsP3R3 even after the ATPB site was disrupted (23Betzenhauser M.J. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21579-21587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We next generated a stable cell line expressing ATPB-mutated InsP3R1 (DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPB) to test whether this site was required for ATP modulation of InsP3R1. In our earlier studies, mutation of the central glycine to alanine was sufficient to completely abrogate specific TNP-ATP binding to a GST fragment containing the ATPB site (22Wagner 2nd, L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present studies, all three glycine residues present in the ATPB site (Gly-2016, Gly-2018, Gly-2021) were mutated to alanine residues to ensure that ATP binding would be eliminated unquestionably. Cells expressing this mutated receptor were tested for ATP modulation in the permeabilized DT40 cells under identical experimental conditions as described for the wild type receptor. Similar to experiments with wild type InsP3R1, ATP (5 mm) increased the rate of IICR in DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPB stimulated with 10 μm InsP3 (Fig. 3). The results presented in Fig. 3 suggest that the ATPB site is not required for ATP modulation of InsP3R1. One possible explanation for this observation is that the presence of the ATPA site, still present in the mutated receptor, might mask any possible effects of the ATPB site mutation. This would be expected based on results from bilayer measurements of the opisthotonos mutant InsP3R1 (InsP3R1-opt) (25Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This spontaneously mutated receptor is devoid of a stretch of amino acids (Gly-1732 to Gln-1839), which contains the ATPA (Gly-1773 to Gly-1780) as well as the PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-1755) (31Street V.A. Bosma M.M. Demas V.P. Regan M.R. Lin D.D. Robinson L.C. Agnew W.S. Tempel B.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 635-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When this mutated receptor was incorporated into bilayers it exhibited a diminished sensitivity to ATP compared with the wild type receptor (25Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1995-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This result led the authors to conclude that the ATPA site conferred the high sensitivity of InsP3R1 to ATP whereas the ATPB site conferred a lower sensitivity to ATP in the absence of the ATPA site. We tested whether the ATPA site is indeed determining the functional effects of ATP in the DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPB cells, using a stable cell line expressing InsP3R1 mutated at both the ATPA and ATPB sites (DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPA/B). Again, mutation of 2 glycine residues to alanine in a GST fragment harboring the ATPA was earlier shown to completely abrogate TNP-ATP binding to the ATPA site (22Wagner 2nd, L.E. Betzenhauser M.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17410-17419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, all glycine residues (5 in total) in the motif were mutated to alanine. This mutant receptor is, therefore, devoid of any putative ATP-binding sites. As shown in Fig. 4, however, ATP was able to increase the rate of IICR from permeabilized DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPA/B. This effect was evident over a range of InsP3 concentrations similar to the effects of ATP on IICR from DT40-InsP3R1 and DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPB cells. ATP also increased IICR in DT40-InsP3R1-ΔATPA/B with an EC50 of 100 μm, which was similar to the sensitivity of wild type InsP3R1 (EC50 of 150 μm). These results indicate that the known ATP-binding sites in InsP3R1 are not required for ATP modulation of this isoform. This is in contrast to the results described above for InsP3R1-opt and could reflect the different methodologies to obtain the data (lipid bilayers measurements versus ER Ca2+ measurements). Alternatively, the results may suggest a role for the other residues removed in the InsP3R1-opt in conferring ATP sensitivity of InsP3R1. It is important to note, however, that the opt mutation had numerous effects on the single channel properties of InsP3R1. For example, changes in the single channel conductance, Ca2+ regulation, and the sensitivity to ATP were apparently induced by the opt deletion (25Tu H. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Glouchankova L. Iino M.

Mutating the ATPA and ATPB sites in InsP3R1 did not alter the ability of ATP to regulate IICR from permeabilized cells expressing this mutant. Macroscopic measurements from pools of permeabilized cells, as described above, may not provide the resolution to detect subtle changes in ATP modulation of InsP3R1-ΔATPB. Because ATP is thought to exert effects on InsP3R activity by altering the channel open probability (7Bezprozvanny I. Ehrlich B.E.

We utilized the nuclear membrane patch-clamp methodology developed by Foskett and co-workers (1Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol.

The aldose reductase (AR) polyol pathway contributes to these microvascular complications, but how it mediates vascular damage in response to hyperglycemia is less understood. The RUNX2 transcription factor, which is repressed in diabetic animals, promotes vascular endothelial cell (EC) migration, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Here we show that physiological levels of glucose (euglycemia) increase RUNX2 DNA binding and transcriptional activity, whereas hyperglycemia does not. However, inhibition of AR reverses hyperglycemic suppression of RUNX2. IGF-1 secretion and IGF receptor phosphorylation by autocrine IGF-1 occur equally in euglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions, suggesting that reduced RUNX2 activity in response to hyperglycemia is not because of altered IGF-1/IGF receptor activation. AR also negatively regulates RUNX2-dependent vascular remodeling in an EC wounded monolayer assay, which is reversed by specific AR inhibition in hyperglycemia. Thus, euglycemia supports RUNX2 activity and promotes normal microvascular EC migration and wound healing, which are repressed under hyperglycemic conditions through the AR polyol pathway.

Thus, euglycemia supports RUNX2 activity and promotes normal microvascular EC migration and wound healing, which are repressed under hyperglycemic conditions through the AR polyol pathway. A major consequence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is hyperglycemia, which contributes to a gradual increase in vascular dysfunction and disease, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and stroke (1.Aronson D. Adv. Cardiol. 2008; 45: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia promotes endothelial dysfunction, vascular leakage, and impaired angiogenesis leading to development of these pathologies (2.Rask-Madsen C. King G.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). AR activity increases under hyperglycemic conditions and in response to oxidative stress and is believed to contribute to diabetic microvascular complications (4.Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Srivastava S.K. FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). AR converts glucose to sorbitol in the presence of NADPH (5.Srivastava S.K. Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Lower levels of NADPH and NAD+, which result from AR activation, may contribute to the oxidative damage observed in diabetics, although the higher levels of sorbitol may promote the formation of AGEs, release of proinflammatory cytokines, increase in osmotic stress, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell damage (6.Cumbie B.C. Hermayer K.L. Vasc. Health Risk Manag. 2007; 3: 823-832PubMed Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia can also lead to activation of an inflammatory response and NFκB expression, which is attenuated upon inhibition of AR (7.Pladzyk A. Reddy A.B. Yadav U.C. Tammali R. Ramana K.V. Srivastava S.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5395-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, up-regulation of AR may be an adaptive response to hyperglycemia (8.Kang E.S. Woo I.S. Kim H.J. Eun S.Y. Paek K.S. Kim H.J. Chang K.C. Lee J.H. Lee H.T. Kim J.H. Nishinaka T.

Diabetes Res. 2007; 2007: 61038Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).

The IGF-1 growth factor signaling pathway is particularly implicated in the hyperglycemic tissue microenvironment. Elevated IGF-1 activates a proangiogenic signaling cascade (11.Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Int. J. Biochem.

Yakar S. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Studies of glucose metabolism have revealed interactions between components of the glucose response and utilization machinery and signal transduction pathways, including the IGF-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt signal transduction pathways that mediate cell survival and increased glucose uptake (13.DeBerardinis R.J.

We and others have shown that IGF-1/IGFR signaling activates the RUNX2 transcription factor through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, which regulates EC migration, proliferation, cell cycle progression, and angiogenesis (15.Namba K.

Dev. 2001; 106: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Recently, reduced RUNX2 expression and down-regulation of RUNX2 target genes were observed in insulin-deficient, hyperglycemic diabetic mice (21.Lu H. Kraut D. Gerstenfeld L.C. Graves D.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22.Fowlkes J.L. Bunn R.C. Liu L. Wahl E.C. Coleman H.N. Cockrell G.E. Perrien D.S. Lumpkin Jr., C.K. Thrailkill K.M. Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Insulin therapy partially restored expression of these genes implicating their responsiveness to glycemic status. Intriguingly, delayed wound healing has been observed in Runx2 heterozygous knock-out mice (23.Tsuji K. Komori T. Noda M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 1481-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24.Jüttner K.V. Perry M.J. Bone. 2007; 41: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether glucose regulates RUNX2 DNA binding and/or transcription and vascular EC wound healing. We now report that glucose increases RUNX2 activity in ECs through increased DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Secretion of autocrine IGF-1 in response to glucose activates IGFR phosphorylation, RUNX2 DNA binding, and transcription of a RUNX2 reporter gene. However, under hyperglycemic conditions, changes in RUNX2 activity are not dependent on changes in IGF-1 secretion or IGFR phosphorylation. It appears that a negative regulatory pathway involving AR utilization of glucose is responsible for repression of RUNX2 activity. The results support the hypothesis that one of the functions of RUNX2 in ECs is to promote migration and repair and that, under hyperglycemic conditions, this function is impaired through AR-mediated reduction in RUNX2 activation. HBME cells (19.Qiao M. Shapiro P. Fosbrink M. Rus H. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% FBS (complete medium), except for specific experiments when they were cultured in glucose and serum-free, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with pyruvate, H2CO3, or glucose (defined medium). Transfection of siRNAs was performed as suggested by the manufacturer (Dharmacon, Inc.). Briefly, HBME cells (400,000/10-cm plate) were cultured for 24 h in complete medium and then transfected with Trans-Messenger transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and siRNA oligonucleotides (25 nm) for 3 h in serum-free medium. Cells were harvested and replated for 24–48 h in defined medium containing 5 or 25 mm glucose prior to preparation of nuclear extracts (for RUNX2) or total protein (for AR) for use in Western blots. For DNA binding assays (see below), cells were cultured for 24 h in complete medium containing 5 mm glucose, transfected for 3 h in serum-free medium, harvested, replated for 24 h, and starved for 16 h prior to glucose treatment and isolation of nuclear extracts. The AR inhibitor alrestatin (Tocris Cookson, Inc., Ellisville, MO) was used at the indicated doses. The MEK inhibitor U0126 was obtained from Calbiochem, and the ERK substrate binding inhibitors 76, 99, and 101 were obtained from Dr. Shapiro (25.Chen F. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Luo Y. Shapiro P. J. Cell Commun. Signal. 2008; 2: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The general PKC inhibitor calphostin C and the PKCβ-specific inhibitor (3-(1-(3-imidazol)-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-anilino-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione) were from Calbiochem. N-Acetylcysteine was obtained from Sigma. Specific RUNX2 (M70) and AR (N20, sc17732) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Actin, phospho-IGFR, and secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Danvers, MA). RUNX2 siRNA was designed using the Dharmacon siRNA target site software available on line (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). The sequences used correspond to the Homo sapiens runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) mRNA (GenBankTM accession number NM_004348; version NM_004348.1; GI, 10863884). Four duplexes were synthesized based on the following locations within the RUNX2 coding sequence: Rx3 (532–550 Runt domain, 5′-GGACGAGGCAAGAGTTTCA-3′; Rx2 (557–575 Runt domain, 5′-CCATAACCGTCTTCACAAA-3′); Rx1 (793–811 C-terminal 5′-CCACAAGGACAGAGTCAGA-3′); Rx4 (1497–1515 C-terminal 5′-GGATGAATCTGTTTGGCGA-3′). Duplexes corresponding to a control GFP target site were also synthesized as follows: si.GFP (9–27, 5′-TCTGTGTGTTTGACTCTGA-3′). RUNX2 siRNA duplexes were used at a final concentration of 50–100 nm. AR siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon based on the published target sequence for AR used to knock down endogenous AR in human lens epithelial cells (7.Pladzyk A. Reddy A.B. Yadav U.C. Tammali R. Ramana K.V. Srivastava S.K. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 5395-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as follows: si.AR (5′- AACGCATTGCTGAGAACTTTA-3′) or scrambled siRNA (5′-AACACGGCTTGAATGACTATA-3′). AR siRNA duplexes were used at a final concentration of 25 nm. Western blot protocols were as described previously (26.Vitolo M.I. Anglin I.E. Mahoney Jr., W.M. Renoud K.J. Gartenhaus R.B. Bachman K.E. Passaniti A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the protein assay from Bio-Rad. Specific proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). HBME cells were starved overnight and treated with glucose for 8 or 24 h. Total RNA was prepared using the Aurum Total RNA mini kit (catalog number 732-6820, Bio-Rad). RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (catalog number M0253S, New England Biolabs). Amplification of cDNA was performed using GE Illustra Hot Start Mix RTG (catalog number ASM-28-9006-53). Products were visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel. The following primer sets were used: MMP13 (292 bp), forward 5′-CCTCCTGGGCCAAATTATGGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CAGCTCCGCATCAACCTGCTG-3; RUNX2 (350 and 416 bp), forward 5′-GCACAGACAGAAGCTTGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCAGTTCTGAAGCACCT-3′; cyclophilin (276 bp), forward 5′-CATCCTGAAGCATACAGGTC and reverse 5′-CAGAAGGAATGGTTTGATGG. PCR conditions were as follows: MMP13, 94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 68 °C, 1 min; 27 cycles; 68 °C, 7 min; RUNX2, 94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min; and cyclophilin, 94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; 35 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were used to measure RUNX2 DNA binding activity as described previously (19.Qiao M. Shapiro P. Fosbrink M. Rus H. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7118-7128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from the human osteocalcin promoter (−141 to −165) and containing the human RUNX2 consensus-binding sequence (shown in boldface), 5′-CGTATTAACCACAATACTCG-3′. Specific RUNX2 transcriptional activation was performed with a luciferase reporter plasmid consisting of six copies of the osteoblast-specific element, Ose2, upstream of a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter in a pGL2 expression vector as described before (16.Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). For all luciferase assays, the pGL2.6XOSE2 plasmid was used at a concentration of 1 μg per well, and the pTK-renilla was used at a concentration of 50 ng per well. Lysates were analyzed using the dual luciferase kit (Promega) and a Turner Design TD 20/20 dual-wavelength luminometer. ECs were cultured in 6-well plates for 24 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. A scratch site was created using a 200-μl pipette tip, and scraped cells were removed with one wash in complete medium (t = 0). Cells were cultured in defined serum-free medium containing various concentrations of glucose or control sugars (mannitol, 2-DG) and inhibitors at the indicated doses. Wounded monolayers were photographed after 24 or 48 h, and the width of the wounded areas was measured from photographic prints. Several regions (n = 5–6) for each treatment were recorded, and the means ± S.D. of each treatment were calculated after normalizing for width of wounded area at t = 0 and expressed as percentage of wound healing. The Quantikine Human IGF-I Immunoassay from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN (catalog number DG100), was used to determine IGF-1 secretion in HBME cells. HBME cells were grown as described and starved overnight in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (for time course) or 0.01% bovine serum albumin (for glucose dosing). After a 16-h serum and glucose starvation, glucose was added. Supernatants were pooled from four plates for each time point or two plates each for glucose dose experiments. Protein was precipitated from supernatants using 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Protein was desalted using 5-kDa Amicon spin filters and phosphate-buffered saline washes. 100 μg of total protein were used for time or dose determination in the ELISA. Absorbance readings at 540 nm were subtracted from readings at 450 nm to correct for optical imperfections in the plate. All data were normalized to total protein for each sample. Cell images were acquired with a Nikon TMS microscope using the E10 Ph1DL objective (0.25 160/−) at room temperature and a Nikon CoolPix 4500 camera (NikonView5 CoolPix Int., version 5.1.3 software). Gel images were acquired with a Kodak DC120 Zoom digital camera (Digital Science 1DLE software). Images were processed using Adobe Image Reader or Microsoft Office Picture Manager, and layouts were compiled with Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Power Point software. All data represent the mean ± S.D. of representative individual experiments that were repeated three times. The number of replicates for data points was ≥3. To compare multiple measurements, data were subjected to Tukey's post-hoc adjustment for 2-by-2 comparisons following analysis of variance with p values <0.05 considered significant as indicated in the figure legends. Based on mouse models of diabetes (21.Lu H. Kraut D. Gerstenfeld L.C. Graves D.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 22.Fowlkes J.L. Bunn R.C. Liu L.

Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and our own published data (18.Qiao M. Shapiro P. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42709-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that glucose metabolism may regulate RUNX2 activity. To examine RUNX2 activation in response to glucose, ECs were depleted of nutrients and then treated with 5 mm glucose (equivalent to physiological levels of resting glucose = 90 mg/dl). Western blots showed that RUNX2 protein was present in a high salt-extractable nuclear (DNA-bound) fraction within 2 h of treatment with peak protein levels evident by 4 h (Fig. 1A, WB). If glucose activates RUNX2, one would expect increased DNA binding to conserved promoter elements of target genes containing the ACACCAA motif (27.Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a RUNX2 consensus-binding site showed that peak RUNX2 activity was evident within 4 h of glucose addition (Fig. 1A, EMSA). This complex contained RUNX2 protein as indicated by supershifting after incubation with RUNX2 antibody (Fig. 1A, lane 7) and was not detectable upon incubation with 100-fold excess cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 1A, lane 6). RUNX2 protein was also detected in cytosolic and nuclear matrix fractions, which, however, were not active in DNA binding assays (data not shown). Interestingly, a glucose dose response showed that 5 mm glucose was optimal in stimulating RUNX2 DNA binding (Fig. 1B, lane 3), with reduced stimulation observed under hyperglycemic (12.5 and 25 mm) conditions (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). The osmotic control sugar, mannitol, or the nonmetabolizable glucose analog, 2-DG did not activate RUNX2 DNA binding (Fig. 1C). De novo mRNA and protein synthesis were not required because actinomycin D or cycloheximide did not inhibit RUNX2 activation in response to glucose (Fig. 1D). In agreement with actinomycin D results, the levels of RUNX2 mRNA did not change in response to glucose (data not shown). DNA binding is a prerequisite for specific transcriptional activation of RUNX2 target promoters and/or specific expression of endogenous target genes. To determine whether glucose could activate RUNX2 target genes, ECs were transfected with a RUNX2 promoter-luciferase plasmid (6XOSE2.Luc). Glucose (5 mm) increased RUNX2-specific luciferase activity within 6 h, with sustained activation for up to 10 h (Fig. 2A). As observed for DNA binding, glucose-activated RUNX2 transcriptional activity was optimal at 5 mm glucose with reduced activation observed at 12.5 and 25 mm glucose (Fig. 2B). Glucose treatment also resulted in activation of the endogenous RUNX2 target gene MMP13. However, both semiquantitative and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR did not reveal any differences in expression in response to different glucose concentrations (data not shown). Several negative regulatory pathways may be operative in vascular cells that might attenuate RUNX2 activity when cells are exposed to high glucose, including the AR polyol pathway (3.Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7128) Google Scholar). Therefore, ECs were treated with the AR inhibitor alrestatin, and RUNX2 DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA (Fig. 3A). Alrestatin did not appear to affect RUNX2 activation in cells exposed to euglycemia (5 mm). In contrast, RUNX2 activity was increased 4-fold with AR inhibition in cells exposed to hyperglycemia (25 mm), consistent with an AR-mediated negative effect on RUNX2 activity at this glucose dose. Because AR inhibitors may also reduce the activity of other members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily (5.Srivastava S.K. Ramana K.V. Bhatnagar A. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 380-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), siRNA oligonucleotides specific for AR were synthesized to knock down AR expression and test for the activation of RUNX2. ECs were cultured in either euglycemic (5 mm) or hyperglycemic (25 mm) conditions, and the levels of AR protein were measured by Western blotting. Hyperglycemic conditions increased the levels of AR protein relative to euglycemia almost 2-fold (Fig. 3B). Transfection with AR-targeted siRNA oligonucleotide sequences blocked the hyperglycemia-induced increases in AR. The effect of AR knockdown on RUNX2 activation under these conditions was then measured with EMSA. Specific AR-targeted siRNA transfection did not alter RUNX2 activity of cells incubated in 5 mm glucose, but it did increase the RUNX2 activity of cells incubated in 25 mm glucose by almost 5-fold relative to untransfected cells (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with an inverse relationship between RUNX2 activity and AR expression, which is induced by hyperglycemia and supports a role for AR in the suppression of RUNX2 activity under hyperglycemic conditions. Because our previous work showed that IGF-1 increases RUNX2 DNA binding activity through the IGFR and MAPK pathways (18.Qiao M. Shapiro P. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42709-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we also examined whether changes in IGF-1/IGFR or ERK signaling could account for glucose-dependent RUNX2 activation. Neutralizing IGFR (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4) or IGF-1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–10) antibodies inhibited glucose-stimulated RUNX2 DNA binding, as did the addition of an IGFR-specific kinase inhibitor (Fig. 4A, lanes 11–14). Similarly, inhibition of the ERK1/2 activator MEK with U0126 or direct inhibition of ERK2/substrate interactions with two specific ATP-independent ERK2 inhibitors (76 and 101) selected via computer-assisted drug design (25.Chen F. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Luo Y. Shapiro P. J. Cell Commun. Signal. 2008; 2: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) also reduced RUNX2 DNA binding in response to glucose (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5 and 8–12). Another selected compound (compound 99) was ineffective at any dose. Hyperglycemia may promote negative growth effects by activation of the PKC pathway. In these cells, inhibition of PKC with either a PKCβ-specific inhibitor or the general PKC inhibitor calphostin C did not restore RUNX2 activity in 25 mm glucose (Fig. 4C, lanes 5, 7, and 9). However, the PKCβ-specific inhibitor reduced RUNX2 activation in response to 5 mm glucose (Fig. 4C, lane 4) as did 10 nm calphostin C (Fig. 4C, lane 6). To determine whether ECs produced autocrine IGF-1 in response to glucose, cell-free and serum-free supernatants were evaluated using an IGF-1-specific ELISA. Secreted IGF-1 levels increased within 10 min and were maximal 30 min after glucose addition (Fig. 5A), although IGF-1 secretion was not significantly different in cells cultured under euglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions (Fig. 5B) nor was phosphorylation of IGF-1R reduced by 25 mm glucose (Fig. 5C). Analysis of ERK expression in response to 5 mm glucose showed that ERK activation also occurred within 10 min and reached maximal levels by 30 min before declining (Fig. 5D). However, activation in hyperglycemia was not appreciably different, nor did treatment with the AR inhibitor alrestatin alter ERK activation in response to 25 mm glucose. Hyperglycemia inhibits EC migration in in vitro models of wound healing (28.Hamuro M. Polan J. Natarajan M. Mohan S. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 162: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and angiogenesis in vivo (29.Facchiano F. Lentini A. Fogliano V. Mancarella S. Rossi C.

Life Sci. 1999; 64: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We showed previously that RUNX2, a nuclear factor, promotes migration and the formation of capillary-like networks by EC in a process requiring IGF-1 and IGFR activation (16.Sun L. Vitolo M. Passaniti A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4994-5001PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Qiao M. Shapiro P. Kumar R. Passaniti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42709-42718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine the role of glucose in RUNX2 activation and EC migration, we measured the EC migratory response to wounding (Fig. 6A). Treatment with 5 mm glucose was as effective as 10% FBS in achieving almost 80% wound closure (Fig. 6B), whereas increasing glucose to 25 mm inhibited closure by about 2.5-fold (30% wound closure). Neither the iso-osmotic control mannitol nor the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-DG stimulated wound closure (Fig. 6, A and B). Furthermore, glucose-induced wound closure was mediated through RUNX2 expression because prior siRNA-induced knockdown of RUNX2 (Fig. 6C) reduced wound closure to <10% in 5 mm glucose (Fig. 6, D and E). The role of AR in suppressing the migration of wounded ECs exposed to hyperglycemia was tested. ECs were cultured as before, and wounded monolayers were treated with 25 mm glucose in the presence or absence of the AR inhibitor alrestatin (Fig. 7A). Cells were observed 24 and 48 h after treatment. At each time point, AR inhibitor-treated cells exhibited improved wound healing relative to untreated cells (Fig. 7B, 50% versus 10% at 24 h; 80% versus 30% at 48 h). Similarly, specific AR siRNA treatment of the ECs (Fig. 7C) also improved wound healing under hyperglycemic conditions (from 2 to 50%), similar to the wound closure observed with 5 mm glucose (57%), whereas scrambled siRNA only marginally improved wound healing (5%) (Fig. 7D). It is well known that activation of the polyol pathway by hyperglycemia results in increased sorbitol production and elevated oxidative stress. To determine whether hyperglycemic repression of RUNX2 activity was mediated by reactive oxygen species, cells were cultured in 25 mm glucose in the presence or absence of the antioxidant NAC. NAC treatment reduced RUNX2 inhibition by hyperglycemia (Fig. 8A) and enhanced vascular EC wound healing in 25 mm glucose (Fig. 8, B and C). These results are therefore co"
https://openalex.org/W2038312184,"The urokinase receptor (uPAR), expressed on the surface of many cell types, coordinates plasmin-mediated cell surface proteolysis for matrix remodeling and promotes cell adhesion by acting as a binding protein for vitronectin. There is great clinical interest in uPAR in the cancer field as numerous reports have demonstrated that up-regulation of the uPA system is correlated with malignancy of various carcinomas. Using both stable cell lines overexpressing uPAR and transient gene transfer, here we provide evidence for a non-reported role of uPAR in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, a process that has recently been termed efferocytosis. When uPAR was expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, hamster melanoma cells, or breast cancer cells (BCCs), there was a robust enhancement in the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. uPAR-expressing cells failed to stimulate engulfment of viable cells, suggesting that uPAR enhances recognition of one or more determinant on the surface of the apoptotic cell. uPAR-mediated engulfment was not inhibited by expression of mutant beta5 integrin, nor was alphavbeta5 integrin-mediated engulfment modulated by cleavage of uPAR by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Further, we found that the more aggressive BCCs had a higher phagocytic capacity that correlated with uPAR expression and cleavage of membrane-associated uPAR in MDA-MB231 BCCs significantly impaired phagocytic activity. Because efferocytosis is critical for the resolution of inflammation and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, overexpression of uPAR in tumor cells may promote a tolerogenic microenvironment that favors tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2054004422,"Surveillance for influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) is important for guiding public health prevention programs to mitigate the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza, including pandemic influenza. Nontraditional sources of data for influenza and ILI surveillance are of interest to public health authorities if their validity can be established.National telephone triage call data were collected through automated means for purposes of syndromic surveillance. For the 17 states with at least 500,000 inhabitants eligible to use the telephone triage services, call volume for respiratory syndrome was compared to CDC weekly number of influenza isolates and percentage of visits to sentinel providers for ILI. The degree to which the call data were correlated with either CDC viral isolates or sentinel provider percentage ILI data was highly variable among states.Telephone triage data in the U.S. are patchy in coverage and therefore not a reliable source of ILI surveillance data on a national scale. However, in states displaying a higher correlation between the call data and the CDC data, call data may be useful as an adjunct to state-level surveillance data, for example at times when sentinel surveillance is not in operation or in areas where sentinel provider coverage is considered insufficient. Sufficient population coverage, a specific ILI syndrome definition, and the use of a threshold of percentage of calls that are for ILI would likely improve the utility of such data for ILI surveillance purposes."

In most animal and fungal mitochondria, the total set of tRNAs required for translation is encoded on the mitochondrial genome and thus of bacterial evolutionary origin. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 2The abbreviations used are: aaRSaminoacyl-tRNA synthetaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGlnRSglutaminyl-tRNA synthetaseTrpRStryptophanyl-tRNA synthetaseAspRSaspartyl-tRNA synthetaseRNAiRNA interference. responsible for charging of mitochondrial tRNAs are always nuclear encoded and need to be imported into mitochondria. We therefore expect to find two sets of aaRSs, one for cytosolic aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis and a second one, of bacterial evolutionary origin, for aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs (1Woese C.R.

In most cells, however, some aaRSs are targeted to both the cytosol as well as to mitochondria (3Small I. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, four aaRSs are double-targeted to both compartments, indicating that they are able to aminoacylate tRNAs of both eukaryotic and bacterial evolutionary origin (4Chatton B. Walter P. Ebel J.P. Lacroute F. Fasiolo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 52-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In plants, the situation is more complex, since protein synthesis occurs in three compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the plastids. A recent analysis in Arabidopsis has shown that, rather than having three unique sets of aaRSs specific for the three translation systems, more than 15 aaRSs were dually targeted to the mitochondria and the plastid (7Duchêne A.M. Giritch A. Hoffmann B. Cognat V. Lancelin D. Peeters N.M. Zaepfel M. Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is at least one aaRS that is shared between all three compartments. In summary, these examples indicate that the overlap between the different sets of aaRSs used in the various translation systems is variable and can be extensive. Most eukaryotes, except many animals and fungi, lack a variable number of mitochondrial tRNA genes. Mitochondrial translation in these organisms depends on import of a small fraction of the corresponding nucleus-encoded cytosolic tRNAs (8Salinas T. Duchêne A.M. Maréchal-Drouard L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 320-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Schneider A. Maréchal-Drouard L.

RNA Biol. 2004; 1: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As a consequence, imported tRNAs are always of eukaryotic evolutionary origin. An intriguing situation is found in trypanosomatids (such as Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp.), where all mitochondrial tRNA genes have apparently been lost and all mitochondrial tRNAs are imported from the cytosol. In these organisms, all mitochondrial tRNAs derive from cytosolic tRNAs (11Schneider A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is therefore reasonable to assume that trypanosomal aaRSs are dually targeted to the cytosol and the mitochondrion. For the T. brucei glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) and the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, the dual localization has been shown experimentally (12Rinehart J. Horn E.K. Wei D. Soll D. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1161-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, dual targeting of essentially all aaRSs is suggested by the fact that the genome of T. brucei and other trypanosomatids encodes only 23 distinct aaRSs, fewer than any other eukaryote that has a mitochondrial translation system (13Berriman M.

Unexpectedly, two distinct genes were found for the tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS), the lysyl-tRNA synthetase and the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS). A recent study has shown that the two trypanosomal TrpRSs are required for cytosolic and mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA formation (14Charrière F. Helgadóttir S. Horn E.K. Söll D. Schneider A. Proc.

Trypanosomal tRNATrp is imported to the mitochondria, where it undergoes C to U editing at the wobble nucleotide and is thiolated at position 33.

Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As we concluded previously (14Charrière F. Helgadóttir S. Horn E.K. Söll D. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the presence of a second TrpRS with expanded substrate specificity is required to efficiently aminoacylate imported, mature tRNATrp in trypanosomal mitochondria. The present study focuses on the characterization and functional analysis of another pair of duplicated trypanosomal aaRSs, the AspRSs. We show that the two enzymes are individually essential for normal growth of insect stage T. brucei. We also demonstrate that the two trypanosomal AspRSs are of eukaryotic evolutionary origin and that the aminoacylation of the cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAAsp species requires these two distinct AspRSs. Sequences were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant data base and the Integrated Microbial Genomes data base (17Markowitz V.M. Szeto E. Palaniappan K.

Henrick K. Nakamura H. Berman H.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 426: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Structure-based alignment was completed using the Multiseq 2.0 module in VMD 1.8.5 (19Roberts E. Eargle J. Wright D. Luthey-Schulten Z.

The sequences were split into four subgroups (eukaryotic AspRSs, archaeal AspRSs, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, and bacterial/mitochondrial AspRSs), and each sequence group was aligned separately with the program MUSCLE (21Edgar R.C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 113Crossref PubMed Scopus (5962) Google Scholar). In a similar fashion as detailed previously (20O'Donoghue P. Sethi A. Woese C.R. Luthey-Schulten Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19003-19008Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the subgroups were then aligned on the bases of a structural superposition and derived structure-based alignment of the solved AspRS crystal structures. Phylogenetic calculation began with an initial neighbor-joining tree (BIONJ) computed with the program PHYML version 3.0.1 (22Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14230) Google Scholar). In the computation of the starting tree and in the subsequent maximum likelihood optimization of branch lengths, tree topology, and rate parameters, the JTT + Γ model of amino acid substitution was used with four evolutionary rate categories, and other parameters were computed from maximum likelihood estimates. The maximum likelihood tree search was performed with the subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) algorithm in PHYML. Bootstrap analysis is from the Shimodaira-Hasegawa re-estimation of log likelihood local bootstrap proportions calculation implemented in PHYML. Procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (23Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem.

As a tag to analyze the localization of Tb-AspRS1 (accession number Tb927.6.1880) and Tb-AspRS2 (accession number Tb10.70.6800), we used a 10-amino acid epitope of the major structural protein of yeast Ty1, which is recognized by the monoclonal antibody BB2 (24Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The sequences corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal Ty1-tagged Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspRS2 were cloned into a derivative of pLew-100 (23Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) to allow tetracycline-inducible expression of the tagged proteins. RNAi of Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspS2 was performed by using stem loop constructs containing the puromycin resistance gene. As inserts, we used a 409-bp fragment (nucleotides 313−721) of the Tb-AspRS1 gene and a 515-bp fragment (nucleotides 3−517) of the Tb-AspRS2 gene. Transfection of T. brucei and selection with antibiotics, cloning, and induction with tetracycline were done as described in Ref. 25McCulloch R. Vassella E. Burton P. Boshart M. Barry J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 262: 53-86PubMed Google Scholar. Fractionation of Ty1 epitope-tagged Tb-AspRS1- and Tb-AspRS2-expressing cells was done as previously described (14Charrière F. Helgadóttir S. Horn E.K. Söll D. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The gene was PCR-amplified using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). Tb-AspRS1 was cloned into NcoI/BamHI in pET15b (Novagen), which encodes an NH2-terminal His tag. After sequence verification, the resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL-21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) and protein expression was autoinduced using the Overnight Express Autoinduction System (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After harvest, the cells were sonicated, and the protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The desired fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Washed T. brucei (3 × 1010 cells) were lysed in 12 ml of SoTE buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA) by nitrogen cavitation (80 bars, 40 min). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and supplemented with 25 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl and subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was applied on a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.7-ml bed volume) equilibrated in acylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl) containing 0.6 m sorbitol and 150 mm NaCl in order to remove the cytosolic tRNA. Approximately 4 ml of the flow-through fraction was collected and loaded onto a Sephadex G-100 column (25-ml bed volume; 25-cm length) equilibrated in acylation buffer. The column was developed in acylation buffer, and 10 fractions (4 ml each) were collected. Finally 100% glycerol (one-ninth volume) and dithiothreitol (to 5 mm) were added to the combined peak fractions (fractions 2 and 3). The resulting samples were aliquoted, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C. Mitoplasts were isolated as described previously (26Schneider A. Charrière F. Pusnik M. Horn E.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An aliquot containing 1.5 mg of mitoplast proteins was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 6800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in acylation buffer (see above) containing 1% CHAPS. The resulting suspension was centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C at a full 21,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used as a source of enzyme in the in vitro aminoacylation reactions. The charging assays were performed as described in Ref. 14Charrière F. Helgadóttir S. Horn E.K. Söll D. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. The substrate amino acids used were a mixture of 77 μm unlabeled and 3 μm [3H]aspartate (specific activity of stock solution: 32 Ci/mmol) or, as a control, 456 μm [14C]glutamine (specific activity of stock solution: 200 mCi/mmol). RNA-free cytosol or mitochondrial matrix extracts were used at 1:25 and 1:2.5 ratios of the total reaction volume, respectively. Native cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs were extracted as described (14Charrière F. Helgadóttir S. Horn E.K. Söll D. Schneider A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6847-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and used at 0.6 and 1 μg/μl, respectively. At these concentrations, the amount of tRNAAsp in both fractions was identical, as determined by Northern analysis (data not shown). The aminoacylation reactions using recombinant Tb-AspRS1 were performed as described above except that 70 nm recombinant Tb-AspRS1 was used as a source of enzyme. ATP production assays were done as described in Ref. 27Schneider A. Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Chanez A.L. Bulliard L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Unlike for most other aaRSs, the T. brucei genome encodes open reading frames for two putative AspRS homologs. The proteins have predicted molecular masses of 62.9 kDa (Tb-AspRS1; accession number Tb927.6.1880) and 60.8 kDa (Tb-AspRS2; accession number Tb10.70.6800). Bioinformatic analysis predicts a weak mitochondrial targeting signal for Tb-AspRS2. Tb-AspRS1 appears to be the ortholog of the cytosolic AspRS of other eukaryotes with which it shares 43–49% of sequence identity. Tb-AspRS2, on the other hand, is more similar to Tb-AspRS1 (43% of sequence identity) rather than to other cytosolic AspRSs (34–38% of sequence identity) of eukaryotes. In order to investigate the relationship between the two trypanosomal AspRSs more precisely, we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis of AspRSs from all three domains of life (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). Nonplant eukaryotes are expected to have two distinct AspRSs, a cytosolic one of eukaryotic evolutionary origin and a mitochondrial one of bacterial descent. As is evident in the phylogeny in Fig. 1, most higher eukaryotes, fungi, and even slime mold follow this pattern. These organisms encode one AspRS that clusters with other eukaryotes on the archaeal-eukaryotic side of the tree, whereas the second (mitochondrial) AspRS groups with the bacterial AspRSs. In T. brucei and other trypanosomatids, there are also two AspRS, but both are of eukaryotic origin, resulting from a gene duplication event along the trypanosomatid line of descent (Fig. 1). Moreover, our analysis revealed eight other major duplications of eukaryotic AspRS in different taxons (see “Discussion”). Trypanosomatids lack a bacterial type AspRS. The same is true for many lower eukaryotes (Fig. 1, shown in red). This is no surprise, since this group includes genera (e.g. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba, and Encephalitozoon) that have mitosomes or hydrogenosomes (e.g. Trichomonas), which lack genomes and therefore do not require organellar aminacylation (28van der Giezen M. Tovar J. Clark C.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2005; 244: 175-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, the genera in this group that have bona fide mitochondria (Plasmodium, Paramecium, and Tetrahymena) import most or even all of their mitochondrial tRNAs from the cytosol. Although Plasmodium encodes only a single AspRS, which must be dually targeted to cytosol and mitochondrion, separate AspRS duplications took place in the Paramecium and Tetrahymena lineages, resulting in two copies of the eukaryotic type AspRS in these organisms. It is plausible that, as is shown here for the trypanosomal AspRSs, one of the enzymes has adapted to function in mitochondria. In order to determine the localization of the two enzymes, we prepared transgenic cell lines allowing inducible expression of Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspRS2 versions carrying the 10-amino acid-long Ty1 peptide at their carboxyl termini (24Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-Ty1 antibody showed a tetracycline-inducible diffuse staining of the tagged Tb-AspRS1 consistent with a cytosolic localization (Fig. 2). For tagged Tb-AspRS2, on the other hand, a staining identical to the one seen with the mitochondrial marker was obtained. Furthermore, the two transgenic cell lines were subjected to a biochemical fractionation analysis, which showed that the tagged Tb-AspRS1 co-purifies with the cytosolic marker, whereas the tagged Tb-AspRS2 is recovered in the pellet together with the mitochondrial marker. Recently, the mitochondrial proteome of insect stage T. brucei has been comprehensively analyzed by mass spectroscopy. This analysis detected several AspRS2 peptides but none that corresponded to AspRS1 (29Panigrahi A.K. Ogata Y. Zíková A. Anupama A. Dalley R.A. Acestor N. Myler P.J. Stuart K.D. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 434-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In summary, these results show that the two trypanosomal AspRSs have a nonoverlapping intracellular distribution; Tb-AspRS1 is exclusively cytosolic, whereas Tb-AspRS2 is exclusively localized to the mitochondrion. In order to determine the function of Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspRS2, we established two stable transgenic cell lines that allow tetracycline-inducible RNAi-mediated ablation of each of the two enzymes independently. The Northern blots in the middle panels of Fig. 3, A and B, show that induction of RNAi in these two cell lines leads to specific degradation of the corresponding Tb-AspRS mRNAs. For the Tb-AspRS2 mRNA, we reproducibly detected two bands indicating that it might be alternatively polyadenylated, as has been observed for other trypanosomal mRNAs (30Vassella E. Braun R. Roditi I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Most importantly, following the depletion of the mRNAs, a growth arrest is observed 1–2 days (for Tb-AspRS1) and 3–4 days (for Tb-AspRS2) after the addition of tetracycline (Fig. 3, A and B, top). Thus, Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspRS2 are both essential for growth of insect stage T. brucei. In order to measure the biochemical phenotype of the Tb-AspRS1 RNAi cell line, we isolated RNA-free cytosolic fractions from uninduced and induced cells. The activities of AspRS and GlnRS (which serves as a control) in both cytosolic fractions were quantified by in vitro aminoacylation assays using labeled aspartate or glutamine and deacylated cytosolic tRNAs as substrates. Ablation of Tb-AspRS1 results in dramatic decrease of the cytosolic AspRS activity (Fig. 3A, bottom right) but does not affect GlnRS activity (Fig. 3A, bottom left). To analyze the biochemical phenotype of the Tb-AspRS2 RNAi cell line, we isolated mitochondria from uninduced and induced cells. Detergent extracts of both mitochondrial fractions were then tested for in vitro AspRS and GlnRS activities using deacylated cytosolic tRNAs as substrate, as described above. Ablation of AspRS2 causes a dramatic decrease of mitochondrial AspRS activity (Fig. 3B, bottom right). Moreover, a 25% decrease of the mitochondrial GlnRS activity is also observed (Fig. 3B, bottom left). This decrease is most likely a pleiotropic effect caused by the growth arrest as observed before (12Rinehart J. Horn E.K. Wei D. Soll D. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1161-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results show that, consistent with their intracellular localization, Tb-AspRS1 and Tb-AspRS2 are responsible for cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNAAsp formation, respectively. Ablation of Tb-AspRS2 should selectively impair mitochondrial translation. However, mitochondrial translation in trypanosomatids is notoriously difficult to measure (31Horváth A. Nebohácova M. Lukes J. Maslov D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7222-7230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most of the proteins encoded in the mitochondrion of T. brucei function either directly in oxidative phosphorylation or as components of the mitochondrial translation machinery that produces them (32Feagin J.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Any interference with mitochondrial translation will ultimately also affect oxidative phosphorylation but not substrate level phosphorylation, for which all proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Thus, assessing the state of oxidative phosphorylation can be used as a proxy for the functionality of the mitochondrial translation system. The mitochondrion of procyclic T. brucei produces ATP by oxidative phosphorylation as well as by substrate level phosphorylation linked to the citric acid cycle (33Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 34Besteiro S. Barrett M.P. Rivière L. Bringaud F. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 185-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Using isolated mitochondria, we have established an assay that allows quantitation of both modes of ATP production. In these assays, antimycin-sensitive oxidative phosphorylation is induced by the addition of succinate. Mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation in the citric acid cycle, which is resistant to antimycin, is induced by the addition of α-ketoglutarate. Isolated mitochondria of T. brucei are depleted for nucleotides; therefore, ADP has to be added in all assays. Atractyloside treatment prevents mitochondrial import of the added ADP and therefore will abolish any type of mitochondrial ATP production (27Schneider A. Bouzaidi-Tiali N. Chanez A.L. Bulliard L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 33Bochud-Allemann N. Schneider A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32849-32854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that ablation of Tb-AspRS2 results in a loss of succinate-induced oxidative phosphorylation but does not affect mitochondrial substrate level phosphorylation assayed by α-ketoglutarate. These results are in line with the reduced mitochondrial AspRS activity observed in Tb-AspRS2-ablated cells and reinforce the essential function of Tb-AspRS2 in mitochondrial translation. To address the question why T. brucei needs distinct cytosolic and mitochondrial AspRSs, we investigated the substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Recombinant Tb-AspRS1 was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was tested by in vitro aminoacylation assays using either cytosolic or mitochondrial tRNA fractions that contained identical amounts of tRNAAsp as substrate. The results in Fig. 5 show that recombinant Tb-AspRS1 efficiently aminoacylates the cytosolic tRNAAsp but cannot recognize the tRNAAsp present in the mitochondrial fraction. It was not possible to perform the same analysis for Tb-AspRS2, since we were not able to produce recombinant enzyme in an active form. However, as shown before (Fig. 3B, bottom), Tb-AspRS2 activity can be measured in mitochondrial detergent extracts. Using these extracts, we could show that Tb-AspRS2, unlike Tb-AspRS1, is able to aminoacylate both the cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAsAsp with essentially the same efficiency. Hence, compared with Tb-AspRS1, Tb-AspRS2 has an expanded substrate specificity. These experiments also show that cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAAsp must be physically different. We know that their sequence is identical, since they derive from the same nuclear gene; the difference must therefore be due to posttranscriptional nucleotide modifications. There are two principal possibilities; the postulated modification could either be mitochondria-specific, in which case it would act as an antideterminant for Tb-AspR"
https://openalex.org/W2005651434,"Background Our understanding of the functional consequences of changes in biodiversity has been hampered by several limitations of previous work, including limited attention to trophic interactions, a focus on species richness rather than evenness, and the use of artificially assembled communities. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, we manipulated the density of an herbivorous snail in natural tide pools and allowed seaweed communities to assemble in an ecologically relevant and non-random manner. Seaweed species evenness and biomass-specific primary productivity (mg O2 h−1 g−1) were higher in tide pools with snails because snails preferentially consumed an otherwise dominant seaweed species that can reduce biomass-specific productivity rates of algal assemblages. Although snails reduced overall seaweed biomass in tide pools, they did not affect gross primary productivity at the scale of tide pools (mg O2 h−1 pool−1 or mg O2 h−1 m−2) because of the enhanced biomass-specific productivity associated with grazer-mediated increases in algal evenness. Significance Our results suggest that increased attention to trophic interactions, diversity measures other than richness, and particularly the effects of consumers on evenness and primary productivity, will improve our understanding of the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and allow more effective links between experimental results and real-world changes in biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1990933472,"Transcriptional feedback loops are central to circadian clock function. However, the role of neural activity and membrane events in molecular rhythms in the fruit fly Drosophila is unclear. To address this question, we expressed a temperature-sensitive, dominant negative allele of the fly homolog of dynamin called shibire(ts1) (shi(ts1)), an active component in membrane vesicle scission.Broad expression in clock cells resulted in unexpectedly long, robust periods (>28 hours) comparable to perturbation of core clock components, suggesting an unappreciated role of membrane dynamics in setting period. Expression in the pacemaker lateral ventral neurons (LNv) was necessary and sufficient for this effect. Manipulation of other endocytic components exacerbated shi(ts1)'s behavioral effects, suggesting its mechanism is specific to endocytic regulation. PKA overexpression rescued period effects suggesting shi(ts1) may downregulate PKA pathways. Levels of the clock component PERIOD were reduced in the shi(ts1)-expressing pacemaker small LNv of flies held at a fully restrictive temperature (29 degrees C). Less restrictive conditions (25 degrees C) delayed cycling proportional to observed behavioral changes. Levels of the neuropeptide PIGMENT-DISPERSING FACTOR (PDF), the only known LNv neurotransmitter, were also reduced, but PERIOD cycling was still delayed in flies lacking PDF, implicating a PDF-independent process. Further, shi(ts1) expression in the eye also results in reduced PER protein and per and vri transcript levels, suggesting that shibire-dependent signaling extends to peripheral clocks. The level of nuclear CLK, transcriptional activator of many core clock genes, is also reduced in shi(ts1) flies, and Clk overexpression suppresses the period-altering effects of shi(ts1).We propose that membrane protein turnover through endocytic regulation of PKA pathways modulates the core clock by altering CLK levels and/or activity. These results suggest an important role for membrane scission in setting circadian period."
https://openalex.org/W1990465279,"Mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase contains a hexamer of alternating alpha and beta subunits. The assembly of this structure requires two specialized chaperones, Atp11p and Atp12p, that bind transiently to beta and alpha. In the absence of Atp11p and Atp12p, the hexamer is not formed, and alpha and beta precipitate as large insoluble aggregates. An early model for the mechanism of chaperone-mediated F(1) assembly (Wang, Z. G., Sheluho, D., Gatti, D. L., and Ackerman, S. H. (2000) EMBO J. 19, 1486-1493) hypothesized that the chaperones themselves look very much like the alpha and beta subunits, and proposed an exchange of Atp11p for alpha and of Atp12p for beta; the driving force for the exchange was expected to be a higher affinity of alpha and beta for each other than for the respective chaperone partners. One important feature of this model was the prediction that as long as Atp11p is bound to beta and Atp12p is bound to alpha, the two F(1) subunits cannot interact at either the catalytic site or the noncatalytic site interface. Here we present the structures of Atp11p from Candida glabrata and Atp12p from Paracoccus denitrificans, and we show that some features of the Wang model are correct, namely that binding of the chaperones to alpha and beta prevents further interactions between these F(1) subunits. However, Atp11p and Atp12p do not resemble alpha or beta, and it is instead the F(1) gamma subunit that initiates the release of the chaperones from alpha and beta and their further assembly into the mature complex."
https://openalex.org/W2145429652,"Background Although microarray technology has become the most common method for studying global gene expression, a plethora of technical factors across the experiment contribute to the variable of genome gene expression profiling using peripheral whole blood. A practical platform needs to be established in order to obtain reliable and reproducible data to meet clinical requirements for biomarker study. Methods and Findings We applied peripheral whole blood samples with globin reduction and performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis using Illumina BeadChips. Real-time PCR was subsequently used to evaluate the quality of array data and elucidate the mode in which hemoglobin interferes in gene expression profiling. We demonstrated that, when applied in the context of standard microarray processing procedures, globin reduction results in a consistent and significant increase in the quality of beadarray data. When compared to their pre-globin reduction counterparts, post-globin reduction samples show improved detection statistics, lowered variance and increased sensitivity. More importantly, gender gene separation is remarkably clearer in post-globin reduction samples than in pre-globin reduction samples. Our study suggests that the poor data obtained from pre-globin reduction samples is the result of the high concentration of hemoglobin derived from red blood cells either interfering with target mRNA binding or giving the pseudo binding background signal. Conclusion We therefore recommend the combination of performing globin mRNA reduction in peripheral whole blood samples and hybridizing on Illumina BeadChips as the practical approach for biomarker study."
https://openalex.org/W2140782898,"Background Hepatitis D (or hepatitis delta) virus is a defective virus that relies on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for transmission; infection with hepatitis D can occur only as coinfection with HBV or superinfection of an existing HBV infection. Because of the bond between the two viruses, control measures for HBV may have also affected the spread of hepatitis D, as evidenced by the decline of hepatitis D in recent years. Since the presence of hepatitis D is associated with suppressed HBV replication and possibly infectivity, it is reasonable to speculate that hepatitis D may facilitate the control of HBV. Methodology and Principal Findings We introduced a mathematical model for the transmission of HBV and hepatitis D, where individuals with dual HBV and hepatitis D infection transmit both viruses. We calculated the reproduction numbers of single HBV infections and dual HBV and hepatitis D infections and examined the endemic prevalences of the two viruses. The results show that hepatitis D virus modulates not only the severity of the HBV epidemic, but also the impact of interventions for HBV. Surprisingly we find that the presence of hepatitis D virus may hamper the eradication of HBV. Interventions that aim to reduce the basic reproduction number of HBV below one may not be sufficient to eradicate the virus, as control of HBV depends also on the reproduction numbers of dual infections. Conclusions and Significance For populations where hepatitis D is endemic, plans for control programs ignoring the presence of hepatitis D may underestimate the HBV epidemic and produce overoptimistic results. The current HBV surveillance should be augmented with monitoring of hepatitis D, in order to improve accuracy of the monitoring and the efficacy of control measures."
https://openalex.org/W2053011873,"Quantitative trait mapping in mice identified a susceptibility locus for gallstones (Lith6) spanning the Apobec-1 locus, the structural gene encoding the RNA-specific cytidine deaminase responsible for production of apolipoprotein B48 in mammalian small intestine and rodent liver. This observation prompted us to compare dietary gallstone susceptibility in Apobec-1−/− mice and congenic C57BL/6 wild type controls. When fed a lithogenic diet (LD) for 2 weeks, 90% Apobec-1−/− mice developed solid gallstones in comparison with 16% wild type controls. LD-fed Apobec-1−/− mice demonstrated increased biliary cholesterol secretion as well as increased cholesterol saturation and bile acid hydrophobicity indices. These changes occurred despite a relative decrease in cholesterol absorption in LD-fed Apobec-1−/− mice. Among the possible mechanisms to account for this phenotype, expression of Cyp7a1 mRNA and protein were significantly decreased in chow-fed Apobec-1−/− mice, decreasing further in LD-fed animals. Cyp7a1 transcription in hepatocyte nuclei, however, was unchanged in Apobec-1−/− mice, excluding transcriptional repression as a potential mechanism for decreased Cyp7a1 expression. We demonstrated that APOBEC-1 binds to AU-rich regions of the 3′-untranslated region of the Cyp7a1 transcript, containing the UUUN(A/U)U consensus motif, using both UV cross-linking to recombinant APOBEC-1 and in vivo RNA co-immunoprecipitation. In vivo Apobec-1-dependent modulation of Cyp7a1 expression was further confirmed following adenovirus-Apobec-1 administration to chow-fed Apobec-1−/− mice, which rescued Cyp7a1 gene expression.

Cholesterol gallstone disease is highly prevalent among western societies and represents a substantial and recurrent financial burden to the health care economy (1Sandler R.S. Everhart J.E.

Considerable attention has focused on the observations that gallbladder disease and cholelithiasis demonstrate familial clustering and that shared genetic factors account for a significant portion of the risk, although environmental modifiers as well as age, gender, body habitus, and ethnicity are also of major importance (reviewed in Ref. 2Lyons M.A. Wittenburg H. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1943-1970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, despite intensive study over many decades, questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which biliary cholesterol becomes supersaturated, leading to the formation of cholesterol monohydrate crystals that eventually nucleate and result in gallstone formation (reviewed in Ref. 3Zanlungo S. Rigotti A. Nervi F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2004; 15: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Insight into the genetic factors that underlie cholesterol gallstone disease has emerged from the study of inbred mouse strains where intercrosses between gallstone-susceptible and -resistant strains have generated a comprehensive array of candidate loci through quantitative trait locus mapping, an approach that has yielded at least 23 LITH loci (2Lyons M.A. Wittenburg H.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 221-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Among the quantitative trait loci identified through this approach is Lith6, a locus on mouse chromosome 6 that mapped to a region that includes Apobec-1 as well as other genes (Pparg and Slco1a1) involved in lipid metabolism (5Lyons M.A. Wittenburg H.

Apobec-1, the RNA-specific catalytic deaminase of the mammalian ApoB (apolipoprotein B) mRNA-editing enzyme (6Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), mediates C to U RNA editing of intestinal ApoB RNA, leading to production of APOB48, the major structural protein on chylomicrons (7Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, mouse and rat (but not human) liver exhibit physiologically regulated Apobec-1-dependent ApoB mRNA editing accompanying a range of developmental, nutritional, and hormonal cues, resulting in the ability of murine hepatocytes to synthesize APOB100 and APOB48 in varying proportions with accompanying changes in hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion (reviewed in Ref. 7Davidson N.O. Shelness G.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 169-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a plausible link between the pathways that regulate hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion and those that regulate enterohepatic bile acid metabolism. These include earlier observations in humans that treatment with bile acid sequestrants or interruption of enterohepatic bile acid cycling increases hepatic VLDL production (8Angelin B. Einarsson K.

Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1004-1016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, treatment of subjects with chenodeoxycholic acid ameliorates hypertriglyceridemia and reduces VLDL secretion through mechanisms that include transcriptional repression of Mttp (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) gene expression (10Miller N.E.

In another approach, treatment of wild type mice with an FXR agonist both protected against diet-induced gallstones and decreased plasma triglyceride levels (13Moschetta A. Bookout A.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Yet other studies demonstrated that mice with liver-specific inactivation of Mttp are protected against diet-induced gallstones (14Amigo L. Castro J. Miquel J.F. Zanlungo S. Young S. Nervi F. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1870-1878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas increased expression of hepatic Mttp was found in humans with cholesterol gallstone disease (15Castro J.

These findings, coupled with earlier observations suggesting that APOB100 is more susceptible (than APOB48) to presecretory degradation in the setting of limiting Mttp expression or function (16Wang Y.

The current studies were undertaken to examine the importance of Apobec-1 as a genetic modifier of cholesterol gallstone formation in a congenic strain of C57BL/6 mice, in particular its functional significance in relation to the Lith6 locus identified earlier (5Lyons M.A. Wittenburg H.

Mice were anesthetized as above after a 4-h fast. An external bile fistula was established surgically via the gallbladder fundus. Hepatic bile was collected for up to 60 min while maintaining body temperature at 37 °C. Hepatic bile volume was determined gravimetrically, assuming a density of 1 g/ml. Bile samples were stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Biliary phospholipid, cholesterol, and total bile acid content were determined enzymatically using a phospholipid B kit (catalog number 990-54009), cholesterol E kit (catalog number 439-17501), and total bile acids kit (catalog number 431-15001), respectively, all from Wako Chemicals (Neuss, Germany). Cholesterol saturation indices in hepatic bile were calculated using published parameters (22Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 945-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual bile salt concentrations were measured via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (23Rossi S.S. Converse J.L. Hofmann A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 589-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of diluted hepatic bile (1:20 dilution prepared in methanol) was injected onto a Pursuit C18 reverse phase column (Varian, Lake Forest, CA) using a Rainin HPXL HPLC system (Varian, Lake Forest, CA). Bile acid standards were purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI) or from Calbiochem. The hydrophobic index of hepatic bile samples was calculated according to published methods (24Heuman D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 719-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed as described above after a 4-h fast. Liver and mucosal scrapings were collected from the small intestine and frozen at −80 °C until analyzed. Tissue lipids were extracted into chloroform/methanol (2:1), and triglyceride, cholesterol, free fatty acids, and phospholipids were analyzed enzymatically with an L-type triglyceride H kit (catalog number 993-37592, 993-37492), cholesterol E, HR series NRFA-HR(2) (catalog number 995-34691, 995-34791), and phospholipids B, respectively (Wako Chemicals). Bile acid pool size was determined as the sum total bile acid content of the entire small intestine, gallbladder, and liver, which were homogenized and extracted together in ethanol with [24-14C]taurocholic acid (0.025 μCi) added as an internal recovery standard (25Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1833-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total bile acid mass was determined enzymatically as above. In addition, fecal bile acid output was determined from stool quantitatively collected from individually housed mice for periods up to 72 h. For each determination, 200-mg triplicate aliquots of dried feces were extracted into ethanol as described (25Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. J.

Wild type and Apobec-1−/− mice were studied prior to initiating the lithogenic diet and again after 8 weeks on the lithogenic diet. Animals were gavaged with 150 μl of corn oil mixed with 1 μCi of [14C]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 2 μCi of [3H]sitostanol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). Feces were collected individually for 48 h after label administration and processed as previously described. The ratio of 14C and 3H in each sample was determined, and cholesterol absorption percentage was calculated as described previously (27Wang D.Q. Paigen B. Carey M.C. J.

Pooled RNA was hybridized to an Agilent Technologies mouse whole genome microarray (G4122A; Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Microarray results were confirmed by real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) using cDNA pooled from 4 or 5 animals/group, and where indicated, the findings were replicated using individual samples. qRT-PCR assays were performed in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and primer pairs designed by Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) (listed in supplemental Table 1). Relative mRNA abundance is expressed as fold change compared with mRNA levels in WT mice consuming the same diet, normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA. Nuclear run-on assays were performed using isolated nuclei freshly prepared from chow-fed WT (n = 5) and Apobec-1−/− mice (n = 5), purified through sucrose gradients, and frozen in liquid nitrogen until used for run-on studies. Nuclear run-on transcription was performed at 30 °C for 30 min in a mixture containing 5 × 107 nuclei; 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP; 150 μCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences); and 100 units of RNaseOUTTM (Invitrogen). RNAs were denatured and hybridized to immobilized cDNA templates encoding ∼300 bp of Cyp7a1, Gapdh, or plasmid vector control, washed at high stringency (30Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

In brief, livers from mice of the indicated genotype were quickly removed and homogenized at 4 °C in buffer I containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm KF, 300 mm sucrose, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet was washed and resuspended in buffer II (buffer I without sucrose), and aliquots representing 25 μg of microsomal protein were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed on either whole liver homogenate or microsome preparations with affinity-purified rabbit anti-CYP7A1 IgG (2 μg/ml), a generous gift from Dr. Simon Hui (San Diego State University) and as control either anti-BiP IgG (StressGen) or anti-HSP40 followed by ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA from total mouse liver RNA was used to amplify the Cyp7a1 3′-untranslated region (UTR). The full-length 3′-UTR was cloned behind a green fluorescent protein cDNA as a reporter for mRNA stability studies using actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), as detailed previously (33Anant S. Murmu N.

Three individual fragments, collectively spanning the entire Cyp7a1 3′-UTR, were used for RNA binding studies. Fragment A spans nucleotides 1642–2314, fragment B spans nucleotides 2287–3274, and fragment C spans nucleotides 3251–4070. Each fragment was cloned into pcDNA3, and the plasmids were linearized and used as templates for in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. In vitro transcription reactions were conducted for 6 h with [α-32P]UTP, and the resultant RNA product was gel-purified through 5% PAGE, 7 m urea. 32P-Labeled cRNA template (100,000 cpm) was incubated with 50–1000 ng of glutathione S-transferase-APOBEC-1 (34Blanc V.

Heparin (3 mg/ml) was then added for another 10 min, and the mixture was digested with RNase T1 (5 units/ml) for another 10 min. The mixture was then subjected to UV cross-linking on ice in a UV Stratalinker 1800 with an energy of 250 mJ/cm2 and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding either rat Apobec-1 (Ad-Apobec-1) or β-galactosidase (Ad-β-galactosidase) were prepared as described (35Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Newberry R.D. Xie Y. Cho S.J.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8565-8573Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and 6 × 108 plaque-forming units were injected into Apobec-1−/− mice. 5 days later, animals were anesthetized after a 4-h fast, livers were collected, and Cyp7a1 expression was examined as described above. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, livers from Ad-Apobec-1-infected Apobec-1−/− mice were removed, diced by hand into small (less than 2-mm) pieces, and cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline complemented with RNaseOUTTM (100 units/ml) and 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 15 min on ice. The cross-link reaction was stopped, and liver pieces were homogenized in 1 ml of polysome lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 units/ml RNaseOUTTM, 1 mmol ribonucleoside vanadyl complex, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates with 4–5 mg of protein were immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-APOBEC-1 IgG or control IgG. The RNA-protein complex pellet with protein A beads was treated with proteinase K for 30 min and reverse cross-linked by incubating the mixture at 65 °C for 60 min. RNA from the final pellet was extracted into phenol/choloroform/isoamyalcohol and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR for Cyp7a1 using the primer pairs indicated in supplemental Table 1. Statistical significance was determined with an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. unless otherwise noted. Body weight was comparable between the genotypes after 2 weeks of feeding an LD with animals of both genotypes losing weight, but there was a striking decrease in liver weight and liver weight/body weight ratio in Apobec-1−/− mice (Table 1). In addition, serum triglyceride levels were 2-fold higher in both chow- and LD-fed Apobec-1−/− mice compared with WT with comparable serum cholesterol levels, whereas hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride content were reduced in LD-fed Apobec-1−/− mice (Table 1). These findings suggested that LD feeding is accompanied by distinctive alterations in lipid metabolism in Apobec-1−/− mice compared with congenic WT controls.TABLE 1Body weight, liver weight, serum, and hepatic lipid profile of WT and Apobec-1−/− mice on both chow and lithogenic dietsParametersChowLithogenic dietpWTApobec-1−/−WTApobec-1−/−Body weight (g)26.53 ± 0.77 (12Hirokane H.

https://openalex.org/W2156328876,"Phycobilisomes (PBsomes) are the extrinsic antenna complexes upon the photosynthetic membranes in red algae and most cyanobacteria. The PBsomes in the cyanobacteria has been proposed to present high lateral mobility on the thylakoid membrane surface. In contrast, direct measurement of PBsome motility in red algae has been lacking so far.In this work, we investigated the dynamics of PBsomes in the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum in vivo and in vitro, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We found that part of the fluorescence recovery could be detected in both partially- and wholly-bleached wild-type and mutant F11 (UTEX 637) cells. Such partial fluorescence recovery was also observed in glutaraldehyde-treated and betaine-treated cells in which PBsome diffusion should be restricted by cross-linking effect, as well as in isolated PBsomes immobilized on the glass slide.On the basis of our previous structural results showing the PBsome crowding on the native photosynthetic membrane as well as the present FRAP data, we concluded that the fluorescence recovery observed during FRAP experiment in red algae is mainly ascribed to the intrinsic photoprocesses of the bleached PBsomes in situ, rather than the rapid diffusion of PBsomes on thylakoid membranes in vivo. Furthermore, direct observations of the fluorescence dynamics of phycoerythrins using FRAP demonstrated the energetic decoupling of phycoerythrins in PBsomes against strong excitation light in vivo, which is proposed as a photoprotective mechanism in red algae attributed by the PBsomes in response to excess light energy."
https://openalex.org/W2010190244,"The existence of drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viruses in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment urgently requires the characterization and development of new antiretroviral drugs designed to inhibit resistant viruses and to complement the existing antiretroviral strategies against AIDS. We assayed several natural or semi-synthetic lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenes in their ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection in permissive cells. We observed that the 30-oxo-calenduladiol triterpene, compound 1, specifically impaired R5-tropic HIV-1 envelope-mediated viral infection and cell fusion in permissive cells, without affecting X4-tropic virus. This lupane derivative competed for the binding of a specific anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody or the natural CCL5 chemokine to the CCR5 viral coreceptor with high affinity. 30-oxo-calenduladiol seems not to interact with the CD4 antigen, the main HIV receptor, or the CXCR4 viral coreceptor. Our results suggest that compound 1 is a specific CCR5 antagonist, because it binds to the CCR5 receptor without triggering cell signaling or receptor internalization, and inhibits RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)-mediated CCR5 internalization, intracellular calcium mobilization, and cell chemotaxis. Furthermore, compound 1 appeared not to interact with beta-chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, or CCR4. Thereby, the 30-oxo-calenduladiol-associated anti-HIV-1 activity against R5-tropic virus appears to rely on the selective occupancy of the CCR5 receptor to inhibit CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection. Therefore, it is plausible that the chemical structure of 30-oxo-calenduladiol or other related dihydroxylated lupane-type triterpenes could represent a good model to develop more potent anti-HIV-1 molecules to inhibit viral infection by interfering with early fusion and entry steps in the HIV life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2020050203,"Covalent modifications of proteins by ubiquitin and the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) have been revealed to be involved in a plethora of cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair and DNA damage responses. It has been well known that in response to DNA damage that blocks transcription elongation, Rpb1, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), is ubiquitylated and subsequently degraded in mammalian and yeast cells. However, it is still an enigma regarding how Pol II responds to damaged DNA and conveys signal(s) for DNA damage-related cellular processes. We found that Rpb1 is also sumoylated in yeast cells upon UV radiation or impairment of transcription elongation, and this modification is independent of DNA damage checkpoint activation. Ubc9, an E2 SUMO conjugase, and Siz1, an E3 SUMO ligase, play important roles in Rpb1 sumoylation. K1487, which is located in the acidic linker region between the C-terminal domain and the globular domain of Rpb1, is the major sumoylation site. Rpb1 sumoylation is not affected by its ubiquitylation, and vice versa, indicating that the two processes do not crosstalk. Abolishment of Rpb1 sumoylation at K1487 does not affect transcription elongation or transcription coupled repair (TCR) of UV-induced DNA damage. However, deficiency in TCR enhances UV-induced Rpb1 sumoylation, presumably due to the persistence of transcription-blocking DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of a gene. Remarkably, abolishment of Rpb1 sumoylation at K1487 causes enhanced and prolonged UV-induced phosphorylation of Rad53, especially in TCR-deficient cells, suggesting that the sumoylation plays a role in restraining the DNA damage checkpoint response caused by transcription-blocking lesions. Our results demonstrate a novel covalent modification of Rpb1 in response to UV induced DNA damage or transcriptional impairment, and unravel an important link between the modification and the DNA damage checkpoint response."
https://openalex.org/W1967602301,"The vitamin D endocrine system is essential for calcium and phosphate homeostasis and skeletal mineralization. The 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) hormone binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to regulate gene expression. These gene products in turn mediate the actions of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in mineral-regulating target cells such as the osteoblast. We showed previously that meningioma 1 (MN1) is a novel target of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in MG-63 osteoblastic cells and that it is a coactivator for VDR-mediated transcription (Sutton, A. L., Zhang, X., Ellison, T. I., and MacDonald, P. N. (2005) Mol. Endocrinol. 19, 2234-2244). However, the functional significance of MN1 in osteoblastic cell biology is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MN1 expression is increased dramatically during differentiation of primary osteoblastic cells. Using calvarial osteoblasts derived from wild-type and MN1 knock-out mice, we provide data supporting an essential role of MN1 in maintaining appropriate osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and function. MN1 knock-out osteoblasts displayed altered morphology, decreased growth rate, impaired motility, and attenuated 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)/VDR-mediated transcription as well as reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. MN1 null osteoblasts were also impaired in supporting osteoclastogenesis in co-culture studies presumably because of marked reduction in the RANKL:OPG ratio in the MN1 null cells. Mechanistic studies supported a transcriptional role for MN1 in controlling RANKL gene expression through activation of the RANKL promoter. Cumulatively, these studies indicate an important role for MN1 in maintaining the appropriate maturation and function of calvarial osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2148793293,"Translation fidelity is critical for protein synthesis and to ensure correct cell functioning. Mutations in the protein synthesis machinery or environmental factors that increase synthesis of mistranslated proteins result in cell death and degeneration and are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, cancer and with an increasing number of mitochondrial disorders. Remarkably, mRNA mistranslation plays critical roles in the evolution of the genetic code, can be beneficial under stress conditions in yeast and in Escherichia coli and is an important source of peptides for MHC class I complex in dendritic cells. Despite this, its biology has been overlooked over the years due to technical difficulties in its detection and quantification. In order to shed new light on the biological relevance of mistranslation we have generated codon misreading in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using drugs and tRNA engineering methodologies. Surprisingly, such mistranslation up-regulated the longevity gene PNC1. Similar results were also obtained in cells grown in the presence of amino acid analogues that promote protein misfolding. The overall data showed that PNC1 is a biomarker of mRNA mistranslation and protein misfolding and that PNC1-GFP fusions can be used to monitor these two important biological phenomena in vivo in an easy manner, thus opening new avenues to understand their biological relevance."
https://openalex.org/W1993696707,"Several authors suggested that gravitational forces are centrally represented in the brain for planning, control and sensorimotor predictions of movements. Furthermore, some studies proposed that the cerebellum computes the inverse dynamics (internal inverse model) whereas others suggested that it computes sensorimotor predictions (internal forward model).This study proposes a model of cerebellar pathways deduced from both biological and physical constraints. The model learns the dynamic inverse computation of the effect of gravitational torques from its sensorimotor predictions without calculating an explicit inverse computation. By using supervised learning, this model learns to control an anthropomorphic robot arm actuated by two antagonists McKibben artificial muscles. This was achieved by using internal parallel feedback loops containing neural networks which anticipate the sensorimotor consequences of the neural commands. The artificial neural networks architecture was similar to the large-scale connectivity of the cerebellar cortex. Movements in the sagittal plane were performed during three sessions combining different initial positions, amplitudes and directions of movements to vary the effects of the gravitational torques applied to the robotic arm. The results show that this model acquired an internal representation of the gravitational effects during vertical arm pointing movements.This is consistent with the proposal that the cerebellar cortex contains an internal representation of gravitational torques which is encoded through a learning process. Furthermore, this model suggests that the cerebellum performs the inverse dynamics computation based on sensorimotor predictions. This highlights the importance of sensorimotor predictions of gravitational torques acting on upper limb movements performed in the gravitational field."
https://openalex.org/W2080767808,"Long-term changes in dopaminergic signaling are thought to underlie the pathophysiology of a number of psychiatric disorders. Several conditions are associated with cognitive deficits such as disturbances in attention processes and learning and memory, suggesting that persistent changes in dopaminergic signaling may alter neural mechanisms underlying these processes. Dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) mice exhibit a persistent five-fold increase in extracellular dopamine levels. Here, we demonstrate that DAT-KO mice display lower hippocampal theta oscillation frequencies during baseline periods of waking and rapid-eye movement sleep. These altered theta oscillations are not reversed via treatment with the antidopaminergic agent haloperidol. Thus, we propose that persistent hyperdopaminergia, together with secondary alterations in other neuromodulatory systems, results in lower frequency activity in neural systems responsible for various cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2016668625,"Background Recognizing an object requires binding together several cues, which may be distributed across different sensory modalities, and ignoring competing information originating from other objects. In addition, knowledge of the semantic category of an object is fundamental to determine how we should react to it. Here we investigate the role of semantic categories in the processing of auditory-visual objects. Methodology/Findings We used an auditory-visual object-recognition task (go/no-go paradigm). We compared recognition times for two categories: a biologically relevant one (animals) and a non-biologically relevant one (means of transport). Participants were asked to react as fast as possible to target objects, presented in the visual and/or the auditory modality, and to withhold their response for distractor objects. A first main finding was that, when participants were presented with unimodal or bimodal congruent stimuli (an image and a sound from the same object), similar reaction times were observed for all object categories. Thus, there was no advantage in the speed of recognition for biologically relevant compared to non-biologically relevant objects. A second finding was that, in the presence of a biologically relevant auditory distractor, the processing of a target object was slowed down, whether or not it was itself biologically relevant. It seems impossible to effectively ignore an animal sound, even when it is irrelevant to the task. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest a specific and mandatory processing of animal sounds, possibly due to phylogenetic memory and consistent with the idea that hearing is particularly efficient as an alerting sense. They also highlight the importance of taking into account the auditory modality when investigating the way object concepts of biologically relevant categories are stored and retrieved."
https://openalex.org/W2041177908,"Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of amoebiasis, and calcium signaling is thought to be involved in amoebic pathogenesis. EhCaBP1, a Ca2+ binding protein of E. histolytica, is essential for parasite growth. High resolution crystal structure of EhCaBP1 suggested an unusual arrangement of the EF-hand domains in the N-terminal part of the structure, while C-terminal part of the protein was not traced. The structure revealed a trimer with amino terminal domains of the three molecules interacting in a head-to-tail manner forming an assembled domain at the interface with EF1 and EF2 motifs of different molecules coming close to each other. In order to understand the specific roles of the two domains of EhCaBP1, the molecule was divided into two halves, and each half was separately expressed. The domains were characterized with respect to their structure, as well as specific functional features, such as ability to activate kinase and bind actin. The domains were also expressed in E. histolytica cells along with green fluorescent protein. The results suggest that the N-terminal domain retains some of the properties, such as localization in phagocytic cups and activation of kinase. Crystal structure of EhCaBP1 with Phenylalanine revealed that the assembled domains, which are similar to Calmodulin N-terminal domain, bind to Phenylalanine revealing the binding mode to the target proteins. The C-terminal domain did not show any of the activities tested. However, over-expression in amebic cells led to a dominant negative phenotype. The results suggest that the two domains of EhCaBP1 are functionally and structurally different from each other. Both the domains are required for structural stability and full range of functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2051221455,"Background Glucocorticoids levels are high in catabolic conditions but it is unclear how much of the catabolic effects are due to negative energy balance versus glucocorticoids and whether there are distinct effects on metabolism and functions of specific muscle proteins. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined whether 14 days of high dose methylprednisolone (MPred, 4 mg/kg/d) Vs food restriction (FR, food intake matched to MPred) in rats had different effects on muscle mitochondrial function and protein fractional synthesis rates (FSR). Lower weight loss (15%) occurred in FR than in MPred (30%) rats, while a 15% increase occurred saline-treated Controls. The per cent muscle loss was significantly greater for MPred than FR. Mitochondrial protein FSR in MPred rats was lower in soleus (51 and 43%, respectively) and plantaris (25 and 55%) than in FR, while similar decline in protein FSR of the mixed, sarcoplasmic, and myosin heavy chain occurred. Mitochondrial enzymatic activity and ATP production were unchanged in soleus while in plantaris cytochrome c oxidase activity was lower in FR than Control, and ATP production rate with pyruvate + malate in MPred plantaris was 28% lower in MPred. Branched-chain amino acid catabolic enzyme activities were higher in both FR and MPred rats indicating enhanced amino acid oxidation capacity. Conclusion/Significance MPred and FR had little impact on mitochondrial function but reduction in muscle protein synthesis occurred in MPred that could be explained on the basis of reduced food intake. A greater decline in proteolysis may explain lesser muscle loss in FR than in MPred rats."
https://openalex.org/W2078717380,"The pathogenic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum secretes dipeptidyl peptidase (Dpp) IV enzyme activity and has two putative DPPIV homologs (HcDPPIVA and HcDPPIVB). We previously showed that HcDPPIVB is the gene responsible for the majority of secreted DppIV activity in H. capsulatum culture supernatant, while we could not detect any functional contribution from HcDPPIVA. In order to determine whether HcDPPIVA encodes a functional DppIV enzyme, we expressed HcDPPIVA in Pichia pastoris and purified the recombinant protein. The recombinant enzyme cleaved synthetic DppIV substrates and had similar biochemical properties to other described DppIV enzymes, with temperature and pH optima of 42 degrees C and 8, respectively. Recombinant HcDppIVA cleaved the host immunoregulatory peptide substance P, indicating the enzyme has the potential to affect the immune response during infection. Expression of HcDPPIVA under heterologous regulatory sequences in H. capsulatum resulted in increased secreted DppIV activity, indicating that the encoded protein can be expressed and secreted by its native organism. However, HcDPPIVA was not required for virulence in a murine model of histoplasmosis. This work reports a fungal enzyme that can function to cleave the immunomodulatory host peptide substance P."
https://openalex.org/W2087311423,"Background Copy number variants (CNVs) occupy a significant portion of the human genome and may have important roles in meiotic recombination, human genome evolution and gene expression. Many genetic diseases may be underlain by CNVs. However, because of the presence of their multiple copies, variability in copy numbers and the diploidy of the human genome, detailed genetic structure of CNVs cannot be readily studied by available techniques. Methodology/Principal Findings Single sperm samples were used as the primary subjects for the study so that CNV haplotypes in the sperm donors could be studied individually. Forty-eight CNVs characterized in a previous study were analyzed using a microarray-based high-throughput genotyping method after multiplex amplification. Seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also included as controls. Two single-base variants, either allelic or paralogous, could be discriminated for all markers. Microarray data were used to resolve SNP alleles and CNV haplotypes, to quantitatively assess the numbers and compositions of the paralogous segments in each CNV haplotype. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study of the genetic structure of CNVs on a large scale. Resulting information may help understand evolution of the human genome, gain insight into many genetic processes, and discriminate between CNVs and SNPs. The highly sensitive high-throughput experimental system with haploid sperm samples as subjects may be used to facilitate detailed large-scale CNV analysis."
