We assessed the incidence of HIV-1 and associated risk factors in a general population FFC to determine population-wide HIV rates.A community-based cohort study was conducted among a random sample of 2191 participants aged 18-49 years. At baseline and 12 months post-baseline, data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics and risky behaviors (including number of partners, new partners, condom use, use of alcohol and illicit drug use). Venous blood was collected for HIV serological testing. HIV incidence was calculated per 100 person years at-risk (pyar) and adjusted incidence rate ratios (Adj.IRR) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression.Overall follow up at 12 months was 76.9% (1685/2191) and was significantly higher among HIV uninfected persons and those with at least 1 year duration of stay in community. Overall HIV-1 incidence was 3.39/100 pyar (95% CI: 2.55-4.49). Among the 25-29 years who drank alcohol, HIV incidence was 7.67/100 pyar (95% CI;4.62-12.7) while it was 5.67/100 pyar (95% CI;3.14-10.2) for 18-24 year olds who drank alcohol. The risk of HIV infection was higher among 25-29 years (adj.IRR = 3.36; 95% CI: 1.48-7.65) and 18-24 years (adj.IRR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.05-6.70) relative to 30+ years. Compared to non-drinkers, HIV incidence increased by frequency of alcohol drinking--occasional drinkers (adj.IRR = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.18-8.57) and regular drinkers (adj.IRR = 4.93; 95% CI: 1.91-12.8).HIV-1 incidence in general fisherfolk population along L. Victoria, Uganda, is high and is mainly associated with young age and alcohol drinking. HIV prevention and control strategies are urgently needed in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2119883895,"Although it is well known that wound healing proceeds incredibly quickly in urodele amphibians, such as newts and salamanders, little is known about skin-wound healing, and no bioactive/effector substance that contributes to wound healing has been identified from these animals. As a step toward understanding salamander wound healing and skin regeneration, a potential wound-healing-promoting peptide (tylotoin; KCVRQNNKRVCK) was identified from salamander skin of Tylototriton verrucosus. It shows comparable wound-healing-promoting ability (EC50=11.14 μg/ml) with epidermal growth factor (EGF; NSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR) in a murine model of full-thickness dermal wound. Tylotoin directly enhances the motility and proliferation of keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and fibroblasts, resulting in accelerated reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation in the wound site. Tylotoin also promotes the release of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are essential in the wound healing response. Gene-encoded tylotoin secreted in salamander skin is possibly an effector molecule for skin wound healing. This study may facilitate understanding of the cellular and molecular events that underlie quick wound healing in salamanders.—Mu, L., Tang, J., Liu, H., Shen, C., Rong, M., Zhang, Z., Lai, R.

Awareness about these activities and knowledge of the associated loads are important for the proper design and pre-clinical testing of spinal implants. The loads on an instrumented vertebral body replacement have been telemetrically measured for approximately 1000 combinations of activities and parameters in 5 patients over a period up to 65 months postoperatively. A database containing, among others, extreme values for load components in more than 13,500 datasets was searched for 10 activities that cause the highest resultant force, bending moment, torsional moment, or shear force in an anatomical direction. The following activities caused high resultant forces: lifting a weight from the ground, forward elevation of straight arms with a weight in hands, moving a weight laterally in front of the body with hanging arms, changing the body position, staircase walking, tying shoes, and upper body flexion. All activities have in common that the center of mass of the upper body was moved anteriorly. Forces up to 1650 N were measured for these activities of daily life. However, there was a large intra- and inter-individual variation in the implant loads for the various activities depending on how exercises were performed. Measured shear forces were usually higher in the posterior direction than in the anterior direction. Activities with high resultant forces usually caused high values of other load components."

Here, we observed that NLRX1 expression was glucose-regulated and blunted by SV40 transformation. In transformed but not primary murine embryonic fibroblasts, NLRX1 expression mediated resistance to an extrinsic apoptotic signal, whereas conferring susceptibility to intrinsic apoptotic signals, such as glycolysis inhibition, increased cytosolic calcium and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In a murine model of colorectal cancer induced by azoxymethane, NLRX1−/− mice developed fewer tumors than wild type mice. In contrast, in a colitis-associated cancer model combining azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium, NLRX1−/− mice developed a more severe pathology likely due to the increased sensitivity to dextran sulfate sodium colitis. Together, these results identify NLRX1 as a critical mitochondrial protein implicated in the regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells. The unique capacity of NLRX1 to regulate the cellular sensitivity toward intrinsic versus extrinsic apoptotic signals suggests a critical role for this protein in numerous physiological processes and pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2015590113,"The non-visual arrestins, arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, belong to a small family of multifunctional cytosolic proteins. Non-visual arrestins interact with hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate GPCR desensitization by binding active phosphorylated GPCRs and uncoupling them from heterotrimeric G proteins. Recently, non-visual arrestins have been shown to mediate G protein-independent signaling by serving as adaptors and scaffolds that assemble multiprotein complexes. By recruiting various partners, including trafficking and signaling proteins, directly to GPCRs, non-visual arrestins connect activated receptors to diverse signaling pathways. To investigate arrestin-mediated signaling, a structural understanding of arrestin activation and interaction with GPCRs is essential. Here we identified global and local conformational changes in the non-visual arrestins upon binding to the model GPCR rhodopsin. To detect conformational changes, pairs of spin labels were introduced into arrestin-2 and arrestin-3, and the interspin distances in the absence and presence of the receptor were measured by double electron electron resonance spectroscopy. Our data indicate that both non-visual arrestins undergo several conformational changes similar to arrestin-1, including the finger loop moving toward the predicted location of the receptor in the complex as well as the C-tail release upon receptor binding. The arrestin-2 results also suggest that there is no clam shell-like closure of the N- and C-domains and that the loop containing residue 136 (homolog of 139 in arrestin-1) has high flexibility in both free and receptor-bound states."

Our work with Toxoplasma gondii provides evidence for Ca2+ influx from the extracellular milieu leading to cytosolic Ca2+ increase and enhancement of virulence traits, such as gliding motility, conoid extrusion, microneme secretion, and host cell invasion. Assays of Mn2+ and Ba2+ uptake do not support a canonical store-regulated Ca2+ entry mechanism. Ca2+ entry was blocked by the L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor nifedipine and stimulated by the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and by the specific L-type Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K-8644. Our results demonstrate that Ca2+ entry is critical for parasite virulence.

Microbial HSLs are classified into two subfamilies, an unnamed new subfamily and the GDSAG motif subfamily. Due to the lack of structural information, the detailed catalytic mechanism of the new subfamily is not yet clarified. Based on sequence analysis, we propose to name the new subfamily as the GTSAG motif subfamily. We identified a novel HSL esterase E25, a member of the GTSAG motif subfamily, by functional metagenomic screening, and resolved its structure at 2.05 Å. E25 is mesophilic (optimum temperature at 50 °C), salt-tolerant, slightly alkaline (optimum pH at 8.5) for its activity, and capable of hydrolyzing short chain monoesters (C2–C10). E25 tends to form dimers both in the crystal and in solution. An E25 monomer contains an N-terminal CAP domain, and a classical α/β hydrolase-fold domain. Residues Ser186, Asp282, and His312 comprise the catalytic triad. Structural and mutational analyses indicated that E25 adopts a dimerization pattern distinct from other HSLs. E25 dimer is mainly stabilized by an N-terminal loop intersection from the CAP domains and hydrogen bonds and salt bridges involving seven highly conserved hydrophilic residues from the catalytic domains. Further analysis indicated that E25 also has some catalytic profiles different from other HSLs. Dimerization is essential for E25 to exert its catalytic activity by keeping the accurate orientation of the catalytic Asp282 within the catalytic triad.

Lipolytic enzymes, including esterases and lipases, have been widely used in food, pharmaceutical, and fine chemical industries (1Jaeger K.E. Eggert T. Lipases for biotechnology.Curr. Opin.

Esterases prefer short to medium chains of monoesters, whereas lipases hydrolyze water-insoluble long-chain triglycerides (3Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T.

Recently, microbial HSLs were classified into two subfamilies, an unnamed new subfamily and the GDSAG motif subfamily, based on different conserved motifs (6Jeon J.H. Lee H.S. Kim J.T. Kim S.J.

The CAP domain is comprised mainly of two N-terminal α-helices and participates in substrate binding. The CAP domain of EST2 has been shown to play an important role in maintaining enzyme activity, stability, and specificity (10Mandrich L. Merone L. Pezzullo M. Cipolla L. Nicotra F. Rossi M. Manco G.

The catalytic domain possesses the classic α/β hydrolase fold, with a central, eight-stranded, mixed parallel β-sheet surrounded by several α-helices (11Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B.

The catalytic domain contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser, Asp/Glu, and His. The key nucleophile Ser typically appears in a conserved GDSAG motif, which forms a sharp elbow in the center of the catalytic domain (12Heikinheimo P. Goldman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D.L.

Sequence analysis showed that these esterases have a catalytic triad formed by Ser, Asp, and His, and the conserved GT(S)SA(G)G motif encompassing the catalytic Ser residue is different from the corresponding motif conserved in the GDSAG motif subfamily. These esterases also form a distinct branch in the phylogenetic tree of microbial HSL enzymes. Based on these sequence characteristics, Jeon et al. (6Jeon J.H. Lee H.S. Kim J.T. Kim S.J. Choi S.H.

Although EstKT4, EstKT7, and EstKT9 have been biochemically characterized as mesophilic (optimum temperatures at 35–45 °C), salt-tolerant, and slightly alkaline (optimum pHs at 8.0–8.5) esterases, it is still unclear whether the esterases from the new subfamily are capable of forming dimers. Also, the detailed catalytic mechanism of enzymes from the new subfamily is not as yet clarified due to the lack of structural information. In this study, based on massive sequence alignment, we propose to name the new subfamily as the GTSAG motif subfamily. We previously constructed a metagenomic library containing 10,652 fosmid clones from the surface sediment sample E505 from the South China Sea (20Li P.Y. Xie B.B. Zhang X.Y. Qin Q.L. Dang H.Y.

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 4.0 (22Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA4: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 4.0.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25549) Google Scholar). SignalP 4.0 (23Petersen T.N. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. SignalP 4.0: discriminating signal peptides from transmembrane regions.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 785-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (7096) Google Scholar) was used to identify the potential signal peptide sequence. The encoding sequence of E25 was amplified from fosmid DNA and cloned into expression vector pET-28a. All of the site-directed mutations and the truncated mutations in E25 were introduced using PCR-based methods and verified by DNA sequencing. The wild-type E25 protein and all mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and their expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 20 h. Cells were collected and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The resulting extract was first purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and then by ion-exchange chromatography on a Source 15Q column (GE Healthcare, Sweden) with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.6 m NaCl. The eluted enzyme fractions were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl. The Superdex-200 column was calibrated in the same buffer with protein size markers, ovalbumin (43 kDa) and conalbumin (75 kDa) from GE Healthcare. The standard reaction system for E25 activity determination contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 0.02 ml of 10 mm p-nitrophenyl (pNP) butyrate, and 0.02 ml of enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. After incubation at 50 °C for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 0.1 ml of 20% (w/v) SDS, and then absorbance of the reaction mixture at 405 nm was measured. One unit of enzyme (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme required to liberate 1 μmol of pNP per min. Substrate specificity assays were performed with the following pNP derivatives: pNP acetate (pNPC2), pNP butyrate (pNPC4), pNP caproate (pNPC6), pNP caprylate (pNPC8), pNP decanoate (pNPC10), pNP laurate (pNPC12), pNP myristate (pNPC14), and pNP palmitate (pNPC16) (Sigma). The optimum temperature for E25 activity was determined ranging from 0 to 80 °C at pH 8.0. For the thermal stability assay, the enzyme was preincubated at temperatures ranging from 0 to 70 °C for 1 h, and the residual activity was measured at 50 °C. The optimum pH for E25 activity was determined ranging from pH 4 to 12 with Britton-Robinson buffer at 50 °C. For the pH stability assay, the enzyme was preincubated in buffers with pH values ranging from 4 to 12 at 20 °C for 1 h, and then the residual activity was measured at pH 8.0 and 50 °C. The effect of NaCl on E25 activity was determined at NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 4.8 m. The effects of metal ions and potential inhibitors on E25 activity were determined by addition of various chemical agents to the reaction mixture. Enzyme kinetic assays were carried out using pNPC4 at concentrations from 0.2 to 5.0 mm. Kinetic parameters were calculated by non-linear regression fit directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Origin8 software. The overall secondary structures of wild-type E25 and its mutants were investigated using a J-810 circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Japan) at 25 °C. CD spectra were collected from 200 to 250 nm at a scanning rate of 200 nm/min with a path length of 0.1 cm. All proteins for CD spectroscopy assays were at a concentration of 8 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Native and SeMet-E25 for crystallization were diluted to 3.0 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, respectively. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were obtained after 2 weeks, using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. E25 crystals grew in buffer containing 0.2 m NaAC·3H2O, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate trihydrate (pH 6.5), and 17% (w/v) PEG 8,000. SeMet-E25 crystals grew in buffer containing 0.2 m NaAC·3H2O (pH 7.8) and 28% (w/v) PEG 3,350. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the BL17U1 beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility using Area Detector Systems Corporation Quantum 315r. The initial diffraction data sets were processed by the HKL2000 program (24Jensen L.H. Refinement and reliability of macromolecular models based on X-ray diffraction data.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The E25 crystal belongs to the P31 space group. The E25 structure was determined by molecular replacement using SeMet-E25 as the starting model. Refinement of the E25 structure was performed using Coot (25Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and Phenix (26Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3624) Google Scholar). All structure figures were generated using PyMOL. The protein interactions, surfaces, and assemblies (PISA) server (27Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) was used to deduce the dimerization interface of E25. The nucleotide sequence encoding E25 has been deposited in the GenBankTM database with accession number KJ624992. The structure of E25 has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession number 4Q05. Seven clones showing lipolytic activities were screened from the E505 fosmid library. Five different genes encoding lipolytic enzymes were identified from these fosmids by construction of subcloning libraries and subsequent sequencing. Sequence analysis indicated that one of the identified genes belongs to the HSL family, which was named E25. E25 is 1,023 bp in length, encoding a protein with 340 amino acid residues. Sequence analysis using the SignalP 4.0 program suggested that E25 might lack an N-terminal signal peptide sequence. Phylogenetic analysis showed that E25 belongs to the unnamed new subfamily of the HSL family (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis suggested that E25 has a catalytic triad formed by Ser186, Asp282, and His312 (Fig. 2). The catalytic Ser186 is located in the conserved GT(S)SA(G)G motif. Analysis of 100 protein sequences from this new subfamily revealed that, among the pentapeptide motifs containing the catalytic Ser in these sequences, GTSAG is the highest hit (Table 1). Based on this, we propose to name the new subfamily (6Jeon J.H. Lee H.S. Kim J.T. Kim S.J. Choi S.H. Kang S.G. Lee J.H.

Biotechnol. 2012; 93: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) within the HSL family as the GTSAG motif subfamily, in correspondence with the GDSAG motif subfamily. We thereafter use the GTSAG motif subfamily to refer to the new subfamily in the text. Except for the reported GT(S)SA(G)G motif, we found that enzymes of the GTSAG motif subfamily also contain other conserved residues and regions, such as DYR/AXPP, PAA/GXXD, GTPXXD, and GTRDXXLS motifs (Fig. 2), which may play important roles in maintaining the function of these enzymes. The catalytic Asp282 of E25 is located in the conserved GTRDXXLS motif.FIGURE 2Multiple sequence alignment of E25 and its homologs.

Open table in a new tab E25 was over-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified. Recombinant E25 efficiently hydrolyzed short-chain pNP-esters (C2–C10) with the highest activity toward pNPC4 (9.99 units/mg), but had little activity toward pNP-esters with acyl chain lengths of >10 carbon atoms (Fig. 3A), indicating that E25 is an esterase. The optimal temperature for E25 activity was 50 °C. E25 retained 93% activity after 1 h incubation at 50 °C (Fig. 3B). E25 had the highest activity at pH 8.5 (Fig. 3C) and showed good tolerance over a wide pH range, retaining over 76% activity at pH 5–10. The E25 activity did not decrease in 3.5 m NaCl, indicating that E25 has good salt tolerance (Fig. 3D). Therefore, E25 is mesophilic, salt tolerant, and slightly alkaline for its activity, consistent with the three reported enzymes from the GTSAG motif subfamily (6Jeon J.H. Lee H.S. Kim J.T. Kim S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2032832904,"Defining the aggressiveness and growth rate of a malignant cell population is a key step in the clinical approach to treating tumor disease. The correct grading of breast cancer (BC) is a fundamental part in determining the appropriate treatment. Biological variables can make it difficult to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BC development. To identify potential markers that can be used for BC classification, we analyzed mRNAs expression profiles, gene copy numbers, microRNAs expression and their association with tumor grade in BC microarray-derived datasets. From mRNA expression results, we found that grade 2 BC is most likely a mixture of grade 1 and grade 3 that have been misclassified, being described by the gene signature of either grade 1 or grade 3. We assessed the potential of the new approach of integrating mRNA expression profile, copy number alterations, and microRNA expression levels to select a limited number of genomic BC biomarkers. The combination of mRNA profile analysis and copy number data with microRNA expression levels led to the identification of two gene signatures of 42 and 4 altered genes (FOXM1, KPNA4, H2AFV and DDX19A) respectively, the latter obtained through a meta-analytical procedure. The 42-based gene signature identifies 4 classes of up- or down-regulated microRNAs (17 microRNAs) and of their 17 target mRNA, and the 4-based genes signature identified 4 microRNAs (Hsa-miR-320d, Hsa-miR-139-5p, Hsa-miR-567 and Hsa-let-7c). These results are discussed from a biological point of view with respect to pathological features of BC. Our identified mRNAs and microRNAs were validated as prognostic factors of BC disease progression, and could potentially facilitate the implementation of assays for laboratory validation, due to their reduced number."
https://openalex.org/W2047935063,"Mesenchymal cells alter and retain their phenotype during skeletal development through activation or suppression of signaling pathways. For example, we have shown that Wnt3a only stimulates osteoblast differentiation in cells with intrinsic osteogenic potential (e.g. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts) and not in fat cell precursors or fibroblasts (3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes or NIH3T3 fibroblasts, respectively). Wnt3a promotes osteogenesis in part by stimulating autocrine production of the osteoinductive ligand Bmp2. Here, we show that the promoter regions of the genes for Bmp2 and the osteoblast marker Alp are epigenetically locked to prevent their expression in nonosteogenic cells. Both genes have conserved CpG islands that exhibit increased CpG methylation, as well as decreased acetylation and increased methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) specifically in nonosteogenic cells. Treatment of pre-adipocytes or fibroblasts with the CpG-demethylating agent 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A renders Bmp2 and Alp responsive to Wnt3a. Hence, drug-induced epigenetic activation of Bmp2 gene expression contributes to Wnt3a-mediated direct trans-differentiation of pre-adipocytes or fibroblasts into osteoblasts. We propose that direct conversion of nonosteogenic cells into osteoblastic cell types without inducing pluripotency may improve prospects for novel epigenetic therapies to treat skeletal afflictions."

In Sweden, there are large differences in mean haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in different hospitals and difficulties implementing national guidelines in everyday practice. This study shows how the participation in an improvement collaborative could facilitate improvements in the quality of care by paediatric diabetes teams. The Swedish paediatric diabetes quality registry, SWEDIABKIDS was used as a tool and resource for feedback and outcome measures.Twelve teams at paediatric diabetes centres, caring for 30% (2302/7660) of patients in Sweden, participated in an 18-month quality improvement program. Each team defined treatment targets, areas needing improvement, and action plans. The main outcome was the centre patients' mean HbA1c levels, but other clinical variables and change concepts were also studied. Data from the previous six months were compared with the first six months after starting the program, and the long-term follow up after another eleven months.All centres reduced mean HbA1c during the second and third periods compared with the first. The mean reduction for all was 3·7 mmol/mol (p<0.001), compared with non-participating centres who improved their mean HbA1c with 1·7 mmol/mol during the same period. Many of the participating centres reduced the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia and/or ketoacidosis, and five centres reached their goal of ensuring that all patients had some sort of physical activity at least once weekly. Change concepts were, for example, improved guidelines, appointment planning, informing the patients, improving teamwork and active use of the registry, and health promotion activities.By involving paediatric diabetes teams in a quality improvement collaborative together with access to a quality register, the quality of paediatric diabetes care can improve, thereby contributing to a reduced risk of late complications for children and adolescents with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2074174829,"Complementary surfaces are buried when peptide hormones, growth factors, or cytokines bind and activate cellular receptors. Although these extended surfaces provide high affinity and specificity to the interactions, they also present great challenges to the design of small molecules that might either mimic or antagonize the process. We show that the insulin receptor (IR) and downstream signals can be activated by targeting a site outside of its ligand-binding domain. A 24-residue peptide having the IR transmembrane (TM) domain sequence activates IR, but not related growth factor receptors, through specific interactions with the receptor TM domain. Like insulin-dependent activation, IR-TM requires that IR have a competent ATP-binding site and kinase activation loop. IR-TM also activates mutated receptors from patients with severe insulin resistance, which do not respond to insulin. These results show that IR can be activated through a pathway that bypasses its canonical ligand-binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2091274095,"The brown seaweed Ectocarpus siliculosus is an emerging model species distributed worldwide in temperate coastal ecosystems. Over 1500 strains of E. siliculosus are available in culture from a broad range of geographic locations and ecological niches. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its capacity to cope with different environmental and biotic stressors, genomic and transcriptomic studies are necessary; this requires the co-isolation of genomic DNA and total RNA. In brown algae, extraction of nucleic acids is hindered by high concentrations of secondary metabolites that co-precipitate with nucleic acids. Here, we propose a reliable, rapid and cost-effective procedure for the co-isolation of high-quality nucleic acids using small quantities of biomass (25-, 50- and 100 mg) from strains of E. siliculosus (RHO12; LIA4A; EC524 and REP10–11) isolated from sites with different environmental conditions. The procedure employs a high pH extraction buffer (pH 9.5) which contains 100 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl, with the addition of 5 mM DTT and 1% sarkosyl to ensure maximum solubility of nucleic acids, effective inhibition of nuclease activity and removal of interfering contaminants (e.g. polysaccharides, polyphenols). The use of sodium acetate together with isopropanol shortened precipitation time and enhanced the yields of DNA/RNA. A phenol:chlorophorm:isoamyl alcohol step was subsequently used to purify the nucleic acids. The present protocol produces high yields of nucleic acids from only 25 mg of fresh algal biomass (0.195 and 0.284 µg mg−1 fresh weigh of RNA and DNA, respectively) and the high quality of the extracted nucleic acids was confirmed through spectrophotometric and electrophoretic analyses. The isolated RNA can be used directly in downstream applications such as RT-PCR and the genomic DNA was suitable for PCR, producing reliable restriction enzyme digestion patterns. Co-isolation of DNA/RNA from different strains indicates that this method is likely to have wider applications for intra- and inter-specific studies on other brown algae."
https://openalex.org/W2149820979,"Interactions between the inflammatory chemokine CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 have been associated with colorectal cancer growth and metastasis, however, a causal role for CCL20 signaling through CCR6 in promoting intestinal carcinogenesis has not been demonstrated in vivo. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CCL20-CCR6 interactions in spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. CCR6-deficient mice were crossed with mice heterozygous for a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene (APCMIN/+ mice) to generate APCMIN/+ mice with CCR6 knocked out (CCR6KO-APCMIN/+ mice). CCR6KO-APCMIN/+ mice had diminished spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis. CCR6KO-APCMIN/+ also had normal sized spleens as compared to the enlarged spleens found in APCMIN/+ mice. Decreased macrophage infiltration into intestinal adenomas and non-tumor epithelium was observed in CCR6KO-APCMIN/+ as compared to APCMIN/+ mice. CCL20 signaling through CCR6 caused increased production of CCL20 by colorectal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, CCL20 had a direct mitogenic effect on colorectal cancer cells. Thus, interactions between CCL20 and CCR6 promote intestinal carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that the intestinal tumorigenesis driven by CCL20-CCR6 interactions may be driven by macrophage recruitment into the intestine as well as proliferation of neoplastic epithelial cells. This interaction could be targeted for the treatment or prevention of malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W1968603215,"Patients with ER/HER2-positive breast cancer have a poor prognosis and are less responsive to selective estrogen receptor modulators; this is presumably due to the crosstalk between ER and HER2. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is essential for the survival and maintenance of the malignant phenotype of breast cancer cells. An intimate relationship exists between FASN, ER and HER2. We hypothesized that FASN may be the downstream effector underlying ER/HER2 crosstalk through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer. The present study implicated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the regulation of FASN expression in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer cells and demonstrated that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, inhibited FASN expression. Cerulenin, a FASN inhibitor, synergized with rapamycin to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell migration and tumorigenesis in ER/HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that inhibiting the mTOR-FASN axis is a promising new strategy for treating ER/HER2-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1978350554,"This investigation was to elucidate the mechanism for microparticle (MP) formation triggered by exposures to high pressure inert gases. Human neutrophils generate MPs at a threshold of ∼186 kilopascals with exposures of 30 min or more. Murine cells are similar, but MP production occurs at a slower rate and continues for ∼4 h, whether or not cells remain under pressure. Neutrophils exposed to elevated gas but not hydrostatic pressure produce MPs according to the potency series: argon ≃ nitrogen > helium. Following a similar pattern, gases activate type-2 nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) and NADPH oxidase (NOX). MP production does not occur with neutrophils exposed to a NOX inhibitor (Nox2ds) or a NOS-2 inhibitor (1400W) or with cells from mice lacking NOS-2. Reactive species cause S-nitrosylation of cytosolic actin that enhances actin polymerization. Protein cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies indicate that increased polymerization occurs because of associations involving vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, focal adhesion kinase, the H(+)/K(+) ATPase β (flippase), the hematopoietic cell multidrug resistance protein ABC transporter (floppase), and protein-disulfide isomerase in proximity to short actin filaments. Using chemical inhibitors or reducing cell concentrations of any of these proteins with small inhibitory RNA abrogates NOS-2 activation, reactive species generation, actin polymerization, and MP production. These effects were also inhibited in cells exposed to UV light, which photoreverses S-nitrosylated cysteine residues and by co-incubations with the antioxidant ebselen or cytochalasin D. The autocatalytic cycle of protein activation is initiated by inert gas-mediated singlet O2 production."
https://openalex.org/W2088873538,"To date, it has been shown that cognitive map representations based on cartographic visualisations are systematically distorted. The grid is a traditional element of map graphics that has rarely been considered in research on perception-based spatial distortions. Grids do not only support the map reader in finding coordinates or locations of objects, they also provide a systematic structure for clustering visual map information (“spatial chunks”). The aim of this study was to examine whether different cartographic kinds of grids reduce spatial distortions and improve recall memory for object locations. Recall performance was measured as both the percentage of correctly recalled objects (hit rate) and the mean distance errors of correctly recalled objects (spatial accuracy). Different kinds of grids (continuous lines, dashed lines, crosses) were applied to topographic maps. These maps were also varied in their type of characteristic areas (LANDSCAPE) and different information layer compositions (DENSITY) to examine the effects of map complexity. The study involving 144 participants shows that all experimental cartographic factors (GRID, LANDSCAPE, DENSITY) improve recall performance and spatial accuracy of learned object locations. Overlaying a topographic map with a grid significantly reduces the mean distance errors of correctly recalled map objects. The paper includes a discussion of a square grid's usefulness concerning object location memory, independent of whether the grid is clearly visible (continuous or dashed lines) or only indicated by crosses."
https://openalex.org/W2043633405,"Blood feeding is an integral process required for physiological functions and propagation of the malaria vector Anopheles. During blood feeding, presence of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium in the blood induces several host effector molecules including microRNAs which play important roles in the development and maturation of the parasite within the mosquito. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the dynamic expression of miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle and parasite development in Anopheles stephensi. Using next generation sequencing technology, we identified 126 miRNAs of which 17 were novel miRNAs. The miRNAs were further validated by northern hybridization and cloning. Blood feeding and parasitized blood feeding in the mosquitoes revealed regulation of 13 and 16 miRNAs respectively. Expression profiling of these miRNAs revealed that significant miRNAs were down-regulated upon parasitized blood feeding with a repertoire of miRNAs showing stage specific up-regulation. Expression profiles of significantly modulated miRNAs were further validated by real time PCR. Target prediction of regulated miRNAs revealed overlapping targeting by different miRNAs. These targets included several metabolic pathways including metabolic, redox homeostasis and protein processing machinery components. Our analysis revealed tight regulation of specific miRNAs post blood feeding and parasite infection in An. stephensi. Such regulated expression suggests possible role of these miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle in mosquito. Another set of miRNAs were also significantly regulated at 42 h and 5 days post infection indicating parasite stage-specific role of host miRNAs. This study will result in better understanding of the role of miRNAs during gonotrophic cycle and parasite development in mosquito and can probably facilitate in devising novel malaria control strategies at vector level."
https://openalex.org/W2001760397,"Background and Aims An immune imbalance in the cytokine profile exerts a profound influence on the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present study evaluated the immune status of T helper (Th) 17 and Th1 cells in patients with HBV-related and non-HBV-related HCC. Methods We randomly enrolled 150 patients with HCC. Blood samples and tissue samples were obtained. The distributions and phenotypic features of Th17 and Th1 cells were determined by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry. Results Compared to corresponding non-tumor regions, the levels of Th17 and Th1 cells were significantly increased in tumors of patients with HCC (P<0.001). The intratumoral densities of IL-17-producing cells and IFN-γ-producing cells were associated with overall survival (OS, P = 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.001) of patients with HCC. The ratio of Th17 to Th1 in HBV-related HCC was higher than in non-HBV-related HCC. A multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the Th17 to Th1 ratio was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.651, P = 0.007) and DFS (HR = 2.456, P = 0.002). Conclusions HBV infections can lead to an imbalance in immune status in patients with HCC. An elevated Th17 to Th1 ratio may promote tumor progression. The Th17 to Th1 ratio could serve as a potential prognostic marker for scoring the severity of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2088174143,"Kidney epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are known to be inactivated by high sodium concentrations (feedback inhibition). Recently, the endothelial sodium channel (EnNaC) was identified to control the nanomechanical properties of the endothelium. EnNaC-dependent endothelial stiffening reduces the release of nitric oxide, the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. To study the regulatory impact of sodium on EnNaC, endothelial cells (EA.hy926 and ex vivo mouse endothelium) were incubated in aldosterone-free solutions containing either low (130 mM) or high (150 mM) sodium concentrations. By applying atomic force microscopy-based nanoindentation, an unexpected positive correlation between increasing sodium concentrations and cortical endothelial stiffness was observed, which can be attributed to functional EnNaC. In particular, an acute rise in sodium concentration (+20 mM) was sufficient to increase EnNaC membrane abundance by 90% and stiffening of the endothelial cortex by 18%. Despite the absence of exogenous aldosterone, these effects were prevented by the aldosterone synthase inhibitor FAD286 (100 nM) or the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-antagonist spironolactone (100 nM), indicating endogenous aldosterone synthesis and MR-dependent signaling. Interestingly, in the presence of high-sodium concentrations, FAD286 increased the transcription of the MR by 69%. Taken together, a novel feedforward activation of EnNaC by sodium is proposed that contrasts ENaC feedback inhibition in kidney."

In cells, matriptase-2 is synthesized as a zymogen. To date, how matriptase-2 expression and activation are regulated remains poorly understood. Here we expressed human matriptase-2 in HEK293 and hepatic BEL-7402, SMMC-7721, and QGY-7703 cells. By labeling cell surface proteins and Western analysis, we examined matriptase-2 cell surface expression, zymogen activation, and ectodomain shedding. Our results show that matriptase-2 was activated on the cell surface but not intracellularly. Activated matriptase-2 underwent ectodomain shedding, producing soluble fragments in the conditioned medium. By testing inactive mutants, R576A and S762A, we found that matriptase-2 activation and shedding were mediated by its own catalytic activity and that the one-chain form of matriptase-2 had little activity in ectodomain shedding. We made additional matriptase-2 mutants, N136Q, N184Q, N216Q, N338Q, N433Q, N453Q, and N518Q, in which each of the predicted N-glycosylation sites was mutated. All of these mutants were expressed on the cell surface. However, mutants N216Q, N453Q, and N518Q, but not the other mutants, had impaired zymogen activation and ectodomain shedding. Our results indicate that N-glycans at specific sites are critical for matriptase-2 activation.

By labeling cell surface proteins and Western analysis, we examined matriptase-2 cell surface expression, zymogen activation, and ectodomain shedding. Our results show that matriptase-2 was activated on the cell surface but not intracellularly. Activated matriptase-2 underwent ectodomain shedding, producing soluble fragments in the conditioned medium. By testing inactive mutants, R576A and S762A, we found that matriptase-2 activation and shedding were mediated by its own catalytic activity and that the one-chain form of matriptase-2 had little activity in ectodomain shedding. We made additional matriptase-2 mutants, N136Q, N184Q, N216Q, N338Q, N433Q, N453Q, and N518Q, in which each of the predicted N-glycosylation sites was mutated. All of these mutants were expressed on the cell surface. However, mutants N216Q, N453Q, and N518Q, but not the other mutants, had impaired zymogen activation and ectodomain shedding. Our results indicate that N-glycans at specific sites are critical for matriptase-2 activation. Together, these data provide new insights into the cell surface expression, zymogen activation, and ectodomain shedding of matriptase-2. Matriptase-2, also known as TMPRSS6, is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family (1Antalis T.M. Bugge T.H. Wu Q. Membrane-anchored serine proteases in health and disease.Prog.

Matriptase-2 plays a key role in iron homeostasis by modulating hepcidin, a hepatic peptide hormone that binds to and down-regulates the iron transporter ferroportin. Low levels of ferroportin prevent iron absorption in the gut and iron release from macrophages. Studies show that matriptase-2 inhibits hepcidin expression by proteolytic cleavage of hemojuvelin, a bone morphogenetic protein co-receptor on the hepatocyte surface membrane that is required for hepcidin gene expression (8Cui Y.

It has been suggested that the shedding may be the first step in the proteolytic processing of matriptase-2 and that this event may be mediated by the single-chain form of matriptase-2 on the cell surface that has weak intrinsic proteolytic activity (29Stirnberg M.

By immunostaining, cell surface labeling, immunoprecipitation, and Western analysis, we examined matriptase-2 protein on the cell surface and in cell lysate and conditioned medium. Our results indicate that matriptase-2 was autoactivated on the cell surface but not inside the cell and that the one-chain form of matriptase-2 had little activity in ectodomain shedding. Moreover, by site-directed mutagenesis, we identified specific N-glycosylation sites in matriptase-2 that are crucial for zymogen activation and ectodomain shedding. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines BEL-7402, SMMC-7721, and QGY-7703 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine at 37 °C with 95% humidified air and 5% CO2. The full-length human matriptase-2 cDNA was synthesized from HepG2 mRNA by reverse transcription PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant matriptase-2 protein expressed by this vector contained a C-terminal V5 tag for protein detection in immunostaining and Western blotting (30Qi X. Jiang J. Zhu M. Wu Q.

The matriptase-2 activation cleavage site mutant R576A; catalytic active site mutant S762A; and N-glycosylation site mutants N136Q, N184Q, N216Q, N338Q, N433Q, N453Q, and N518Q were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using wild-type (WT) matriptase-2 plasmid as a template. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids expressing human matriptase-2 WT and mutants were transfected into HEK293 and hepatic cells using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific). After 5 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM medium. The conditioned medium was collected after 36 h, and matriptase-2 proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5-antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads, as described previously (31Dong N. Fang C.

The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1:100; Sigma). Matriptase-2 proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence (reducing) or absence (non-reducing) of β-mercaptoethanol followed by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-V5 antibody. Western blots were incubated with a chemiluminescence substrate solution (EZ-ECL, Biological Industries) and exposed to x-ray films. HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing matriptase-2 and cultured in 6-well plates with glass coverslips. After 24–48 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with an anti-V5-antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were mounted in Fluomount-G reagent (Southern Biotech). Immunostained cells were examined, and images were taken with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV500). To identify proteases involved in matriptase-2 shedding, protease inhibitors of different classes, including trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor (benzamidine, 2.5 mm), metalloproteinase inhibitor (GM6001, 50 μm), ADAM inhibitor (TAPI-1, 50 μm), and cysteine protease inhibitor (ALLM, 10 μm), were added to cultured HEK293 cells expressing WT matriptase-2 (32Jiang J.

The conditioned medium was collected after 36 h, and the cells were lysed. Matriptase-2 protein fragments in the conditioned medium and cell lysate were analyzed with immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, as described above. To examine carbohydrate contents on matriptase-2, transfected HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells expressing matriptase-2 were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysate (50 μg of proteins) was incubated in a denaturing buffer at 98 °C for 10 min. Peptide-N-glycosidase F and O-glycosidase (New England Biolabs) were then added, either individually or together, to the samples and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an HRP-conjugated anti-V5 antibody. HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells expressing matriptase-2 were grown in culture. Cell surface proteins were labeled using methods described previously (30Qi X. Jiang J. Zhu M. Wu Q. Human corin isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails that alter cell surface targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 20963-20969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and labeled with cell membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin (1 mmol/liter) (Pierce) at 4 °C for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by glycine (100 mmol/liter) in PBS, and the cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1:100 dilution). Streptavidin-Sepharose beads (30 μl) were added into the cell lysate, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the beads were boiled in a Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an HRP-conjugated anti-V5 antibody. Procedures for flow cytometry to study cell surface proteins were based on methods published previously (30Qi X. Jiang J. Zhu M. Wu Q. Human corin isoforms with different cytoplasmic tails that alter cell surface targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 20963-20969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Matriptase-2 WT and mutants were expressed in transfected HEK293 cells. The cells were isolated and incubated with a primary anti-V5 antibody and then a secondary antibody conjugated with FITC. Life gating was performed using pyridinium iodide (Sigma). Experiments were done using a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with CellQuest software. We expressed human matriptase-2 in HEK293 cells and human hepatic cancer BEL-7402 cells. To verify the surface expression of matriptase-2 in these cells, immunostaining was performed using an antibody recognizing the V5 tag at the C terminus of recombinant matriptase-2. Under non-cell membrane-permeable conditions, positive staining was detected in both HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells transfected with matriptase-2-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1). No positive staining was detected in control HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells transfected with a vector (Fig. 1). The results confirmed the cell surface expression and the predicted membrane topology of matriptase-2 in HEK293 and BEL-7402 cells in our experiments. We analyzed matriptase-2 protein in transfected HEK293 cells by Western blotting. Under non-reducing conditions, a major band of ∼120 kDa was found in cell lysate (Fig. 2A, left), consistent with the predicted molecular mass of matriptase-2 (2Ramsay A.J. Reid J.C. Velasco G.

Under reducing conditions, four bands of ∼110, ∼90, ∼60, and ∼30 kDa, respectively, were found in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2B, right), which probably represented matriptase-2 fragments cleaved at different positions (Fig. 2C). In controls, no specific bands were detected in cell lysate or conditioned medium from vector-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Matriptase-2 is primarily of liver origin (3Velasco G. Cal S.

Instead, we expressed and analyzed recombinant matriptase-2 in three human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.

https://openalex.org/W2071989361,"The analysis of cross-correlations is extensively applied for the understanding of interconnections in stock markets and the portfolio risk estimation. Current studies of correlations in Chinese market mainly focus on the static correlations between return series, and this calls for an urgent need to investigate their dynamic correlations. Our study aims to reveal the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market, and offer an exact interpretation for the evolution behavior. The correlation matrices constructed from the return series of 367 A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2011 are calculated over a moving window with a size of 400 days. The evolutions of the statistical properties of the correlation coefficients, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of the correlation matrices are carefully analyzed. We find that the stock correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these volatile periods than calm periods. By investigating the significant contributors of the deviating eigenvectors in different time periods, we observe a dynamic evolution behavior in business sectors such as IT, electronics, and real estate, which lead the rise (drop) before (after) the crashes. Our results provide new perspectives for the understanding of the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chines stock markets, and the result of risk estimation is valuable for the application of risk management."

OPAL-PLUS provided data on numbers of primary care consultations, prescriptions, unplanned hospital admissions, and secondary care referrals, extracted from medical records for up to five years following the baseline OPAL data collection.OPAL participants were a diverse sample of 240 older adults with a mean age of 78 years. They were recruited from 12 General Practitioner surgeries from low, middle, and high areas of deprivation in a city in the West of England. Primary care consultations, secondary care referrals, unplanned hospital admissions, number of prescriptions and new disease diagnoses were assessed for 213 (104 females) of the original 240 OPAL participants who had either consented to participate in OPAL-PLUS or already died during the follow-up period.In regression modelling, adjusted for socio-economic variables, existing disease, weight status, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day predicted subsequent numbers of prescriptions. Steps taken per day and MVPA also predicted unplanned hospital admissions, although the strength of the effect was reduced when further adjustment was made for lower limb function.Community-based programs are needed which are successful in engaging older adults in their late 70s and 80s in more walking, MVPA and activity that helps them avoid loss of physical function. There is a potential for cost savings to health services through reduced reliance on prescriptions and fewer unplanned hospital admissions."
https://openalex.org/W2049049366,"Stellate cells are distributed throughout organs, where, upon chronic damage, they become activated and proliferate to secrete collagen, which results in organ fibrosis. An intriguing property of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is that they undergo apoptosis when collagen is resolved by stopping tissue damage or by treatment, even though the mechanisms are unknown. Here we disclose the fact that HSCs, normal diploid cells, acquired dependence on collagen for their growth during the transition from quiescent to active states. The intramolecular RGD motifs of collagen were exposed by cleavage with their own membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP). The following evidence supports this conclusion. When rat activated HSCs (aHSCs) were transduced with siRNA against the collagen-specific chaperone gp46 to inhibit collagen secretion, the cells underwent autophagy followed by apoptosis. Concomitantly, the growth of aHSCs was suppressed, whereas that of quiescent HSCs was not. These in vitro results are compatible with the in vivo observation that apoptosis of aHSCs was induced in cirrhotic livers of rats treated with siRNAgp46. siRNA against MT1-MMP and addition of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), which mainly inhibits MT1-MMP, also significantly suppressed the growth of aHSCs in vitro. The RGD inhibitors echistatin and GRGDS peptide and siRNA against the RGD receptor αVβ1 resulted in the inhibition of aHSCs growth.

Stellate cells, which are responsible for fibrosis, were first found in the liver and subsequently found to be distributed throughout organs (1Zhao L. Burt A.D. The diffuse stellate cell system.J. Mol. Histol. 2007; 38: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They are characterized by the specific feature of taking up vitamin A and depositing it as intracytoplasmic droplets. Recent studies revealed an additional important characteristic of stellate cells in the liver: a pivotal role in liver regeneration (2Boulter L. Govaere O. Bird T.G. Radulescu S. Ramachandran P.

Despite the diffuse distribution of stellate cells, most detailed investigations of their character have been carried out with cells of hepatic origin. In the liver, under conditions in which the tissue is exposed to chronic insults such as viral infection, excess deposition of fat, regurgitation of bile acids, etc., hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) 2The abbreviations used are: HSChepatic stellate cellMT1-MMPmembrane type 1 metalloproteinaseTIMPtissue inhibitor(s) of metalloproteinaseaHSCactivated hepatic stellate cellVA-lipvitamin A-coupled liposomeαSMAα-smooth muscle actinGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinqHSCquiescent hepatic stellate cellDMNdimethylnitrosamine. change from quiescent to activated states and proliferate. During this process, HSCs secrete collagen, simultaneously express membrane type 1 metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and secrete soluble MMPs (4Hemmann S. Graf J. Roderfeld M. Roeb E.

However, because tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) are also secreted from activated HSCs (aHSCs) (4Hemmann S. Graf J. Roderfeld M. Roeb E.

In contrast, when the chronic insults are removed or halted, aHSCs undergo apoptosis (5Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J.

Regarding the mechanism for apoptosis of aHSCs associated with resolution of fibrosis, reduced expression of TIMP has been speculated initially to be a main factor, highlighting a potential role of TIMP-1 in aHSC survival (5Iredale J.P.

The involvement of TIMP-1 in the spontaneous resolution of fibrosis and apoptosis of aHSCs was described further by employing transgenic mice (7Yoshiji H. Kuriyama S. Yoshii J. Ikenaka Y. Noguchi R. Nakatani T. Tsujinoue H. Yanase K. Namisaki T. Imazu H. Fukui H. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 attenuates spontaneous liver fibrosis resolution in the transgenic mouse.Hepatology. 2002; 36: 850-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the function of TIMP to inhibit apoptosis of aHSCs was ascribed to their effect on metalloproteinase (8Murphy F.R. Issa R. Zhou X. Ratnarajah S. Nagase H. Arthur M.J. Benyon C. Iredale J.P. Inhibition of apoptosis of activated hepatic stellate cells by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 is mediated via effects on matrix metalloproteinase inhibition: implications for reversibility of liver fibrosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11069-11076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the involvement of collagen itself in sustaining aHSC survival was postulated, although precise molecular mechanisms have not been clarified (9Issa R. Zhou X. Trim N. Millward-Sadler H. Krane S. Benyon C. Iredale J. Mutation in collagen-1 that confers resistance to the action of collagenase results in failure of recovery from CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, persistence of activated hepatic stellate cells, and diminished hepatocyte regeneration.FASEB J. 2003; 7: 47-49Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, a mechanism that is irrelevant to the role of collagen was proposed for induction of apoptosis of aHSCs: cleavage of cellular N-cadherin by MMP2 (10Hartland S.N. Murphy F. Aucott R.L.

This strongly suggests a relevance of collagen deposition to the survival of aHSCs and activated pancreatic stellate cells. Because a detailed clarification of the mechanisms for these cellular fates could provide novel therapeutic opportunities for fibrosis, in this study, we explored the molecular events underlying the apoptosis or, conversely, survival of aHSCs with special reference to the role of collagen cleaved by its own MT1-MMP. Recombinant human MT1-MMP, rat TIMP-1, mouse TIMP-2, human trypsin3/PRSS3, and 4-(2-aminoethyl-benzensulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Inhibitor of PI3K (LY294002), AKT (AKT-in), and IκBα (BAY11-7082) were from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). GRGDS peptide was from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), and GRGES was from Peptide International (Louisville, KY). Rat tail collagen, echistatin, and antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β (LC3B) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Antibody for MT1-MMP were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Antibody for collagen type I was from Rockland Immunochemicals Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA) and Abcam, and that against GAPDH was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Antibodies against PI3K, AKT, and IκBα and their phosphorylated forms and integrin β3, caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibody against LC3B was from Invitrogen. Peroxidase-coupled antibodies and gelatin-Sepharose- or heparin-packed columns were from GE Healthcare (Waukesha, WI) and Cell Signaling Technology. Antibody against fibronectin was from BD Biosciences, and that against vitronectin was from Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). HSCs were isolated from livers of Sprague-Dawley rat as described previously (11Sato Y. Murase K. Kato J. Kobune M. Sato T. Kawano Y. Takimoto R. Takada K. Miyanishi K. Matsunaga T. Takayama T.

Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). An HSC-enriched fraction was obtained by density gradient centrifugation in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 13.5% Nycodenz (Axis-Shield plc, Dundee, Scotland) at 1400 × g for 20 min and cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., South Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Purity was assessed by microscopy and immunocytochemistry using antibodies against GFAP, desmin, and αSMA. Both the cell purity and viability exceeded 95%. Cells cultured for 1–2 days were used as quiescent HSCs (qHSCs), which do not proliferate, contain vitamin A in lipid droplets, and express GFAP but not collagen (3Yin C. Evason K.J. Asahina K.

HSCs subcultured for 4–5 days transdifferentiate spontaneously into activated myofibroblast-like cells, used as aHSCs, which proliferate to induce fibrosis and express αSMA, gp46, and collagen. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Sapporo Medical University. siRNA against gp46 was purchased from Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. (Sapporo, Japan). siRNAs against integrins, MMPs, fibronectin, and GFP were from Ambion (Foster City, CA). The sequences of siRNA are shown in supplemental Table 1. HSCs in 6-well culture plates were transfected with 5–10 nm of siRNAs using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Where stated, cells transfected with siRNAGFP with the same concentration and under the same conditions were used as a control. Equal amounts of protein extracts of cell lysates were resolved over 4/20 SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PDVF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with primary and secondary antibodies and visualized with ECL (GE Healthcare). Conditioned media of aHSCs were also subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by cleanup with a ReadyPrepTM 2-D cleanup kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and used for reverse transcription with high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) using a 7500/7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of primer are shown in supplemental Table 2. The results were expressed as the ratio of the number of copies of the product gene to the number of copies of a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) from the same RNA sample and subjected to PCR. HSCs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-PBS at room temperature for 30 min, blocked in membrane blocking solution (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 30 min, subjected to staining of GFAP, desmin, and αSMA, and visualized by Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibody. For immunohistochemistry, a rat was perfused with saline and Mildform (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and liver specimens were fixed in Mildform at 4 °C overnight, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Sections were stained with anti-collagen I, αSMA, and GFAP antibody and visualized by HRP- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. For analysis of the fibrosis area, each section was also stained with 0.1% Sirius red in saturated picric acid for 90 min. ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with or without DAPI (Invitrogen) was used as a mounting medium. All samples were examined under a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence Corp., Osaka, Japan) with planApo ×20/0.75, S planFluor Extra-Long Working Distance ×20/0.45 Ph1, and planApo ×4/0.2 objective lenses (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Photographs were captured using the BZ-9000 application for observation (Keyence Corp.) and processed with BZ-II Analyzer 1.31 (Keyence Corp.) for background adjustment and Photoshop Elements 4.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) for adjustments of color, brightness, and contrast balance with an identical setting for all comparative analyses. Total RNA of qHSCs and aHSCs from three independent isolations were subjected to microarray analyses with a SurePrint G3 Rat GE 8 × 60K microarray (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A WST-1 proliferation assay was carried out using the Premix assay system (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) for consolidation of the screening assay. If necessary, αSMA-positive cells were counted. HSCs were stained for apoptotic change by TUNEL assay with an in situ cell death detection kit, POD (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The same kit was used for tissue specimens. The induction of autophagy was confirmed by immunostaining and Western blotting of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). The cells were also analyzed by electron microscopic observation according to a method described previously (14Chiba H. Sakai N. Murata M. Osanai M. Ninomiya T. Kojima T. Sawada N. The nuclear receptor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α acts as a morphogen to induce the formation of microvilli.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Collagen secreted by rat HSCs was assessed by Sircol soluble collagen assay (Biocolor Ltd., County Antrim, UK) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. MMP substrate III, fluorogenic (Calbiochem) was used to determine MMP (gelatinase) activity. Aliquots of 40 μl of culture medium and collagenase type IV from Clostridium histolyticum (Invitrogen) for standard curves were incubated with the substrate (2 μm) in 160 μl of the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium azide) at 37 °C for 24 h. The fluorescence signal was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (340/485 nm). Recombinant human MT1-MMP (100 μg/ml) was activated by recombinant human active Trypsin3/PRSS3 (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h in the activation buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Brij-35 (pH 7.5)) and incubated with 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl-benzensulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) at 25 °C for 15 min for termination. Aliquots of 6 μg of rat tail collagen dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid were cleaved into 34 and ¼ fragments by 500 ng of MT1-MMP for 20 h at 25 °C in the 100 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 3 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2 (pH 8.5)). Digestion was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA. Cleavage products were separated under reducing condition on SDS-PAGE gel and confirmed by BioSafe Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad). The fragments were dialyzed against PBS using a mini dialysis kit, 8 kDa cutoff (GE Healthcare). 96-well plates were coated with 100 μl of acid-soluble or MT1-MMP-cleaved collagen (10 μg/cm2) for 4 h at 25 or 37 °C, respectively, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and blocked with 0.5% BSA in DMEM for 1 h at 4 °C. VA-lip-siRNAgp46 was prepared according to a method described earlier (11Sato Y. Murase K. Kato J. Kobune M. Sato T. Kawano Y. Takimoto R. Takada K. Miyanishi K. Matsunaga T. Takayama T. Niitsu Y. Resolution of liver cirrhosis using vitamin A-coupled liposomes to deliver siRNA against a collagen-specific chaperone.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), paying particular attention to keep VA (retinol, Sigma-Aldrich) frozen in DMSO for each use. Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-treated Sprague-Dawley male rats and normal rats weighing 200 g were injected with VA-lip-siRNAgp46 (Lipotrust (Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd.), 2 μmol/kg; VA, 2 μmol/kg; siRNA, 3 mg/kg) 4–5 times through the tail vein. Statistical analyses were performed, and differences between control and other groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey Honestly Significant Difference Test. Paired Student's t tests were used to compare the data between two different samples. To substantiate the hypothesis that the survival of aHSCs is sustained by collagen in an autocrine manner, they were transfected with siRNA against gp46, which specifically inhibits secretion of all types of collagen. Expression of gp46 in aHSCs transfected with siRNAgp46 was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner, and the suppression lasted for 5 days (Fig. 1A). The collagen concentration in the culture medium was reduced substantially to the basal level (Fig. 1B). Cell counts of the transfectants decreased gradually and significantly as cultivation proceeded (Fig. 1C). The decrement curve of cell count inversely paralleled the transient augmentation of autophagy cells, which reached a peak at day 3 (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2, A–C) and with the subsequent accumulation of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 were observed in aHSCs treated with gp46 siRNA compared with untreated aHSCs (Fig. 1, F and G).FIGURE 2Effects of siRNAgp46 on autophagy induction of aHSCs. A, representative transmission electron microscopic photographs of aHSCs treated with siRNAgp46 at 10 nm for 3 days showing autophagosomes (arrows). Scale bar = 20 μm. B, aHSCs were treated with siRNAgp46 at 10 nm for 1–5 days, and the induction of autophagy was confirmed by Western blotting analysis of LC3, which exists in two forms, the 18-kDa cytosolic protein (LC3-I) and the processed 16-kDa form (LC3-II), which associates with autophagosome membranes.

The number of cells of qHSCs treated with siRNAgp46 did not change during 7 days of cultivation (Fig. 3A), and dye exclusion assays revealed no significant death of qHSCs treated with siRNAgp46 during this period (Fig. 3B). During this cultivation, the expression of gp46 and collagen was kept suppressed (Fig. 3E). In contrast, siRNAgp46 non-transduced qHSCs started to proliferate after day 3 of cultivation, expressing gp46 and collagen on days 1 and 2 (Fig. 3E). When we examined the switch of expression of GFAP to αSMA with immunostaining, the transition was retarded substantially in siRNAgp46-transduced qHSCs compared with non-transduced cells (Fig. 3, C–E). To verify the above in vitro observations with in vivo experiments and to confirm the previously reported apoptotic effect of siRNAgp46 in DMN rats, we injected VA-lip-siRNAgp46 into DMN and normal rats. In DMN rats, concomitantly with resolution of collagen fibrils (Fig. 4A), nearly 10% of αSMA-positive cells in the αSMA-positive cell population were stained by TUNEL assays after four sets of injection of VA-lip-siRNAgp46 (Fig. 4, B and C) when the fibrosis area and a substantial number of aHSCs should have been already reduced by treatment (Fig. 4, D–F). These results are compatible with our previous report (11Sato Y. Murase K. Kato J. Kobune M. Sato T. Kawano Y. Takimoto R. Takada K. Miyanishi K. Matsunaga T. Takayama T. Niitsu Y. Resolution of liver cirrhosis using vitamin A-coupled liposomes to deliver siRNA against a collagen-specific chaperone.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), although, in normal rats, even after four injections of drug, no TUNEL-positive cells were observed in a GFAP-positive cell population (Fig. 4, B and C). To ensure that the growth suppression of siRNAgp46 transfectants is due to the diminution of collagen in the culture medium and not due to the collagen-irrelevant cytotoxic effect of siRNAgp46, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, we explored the possible restoration of the suppressed growth of transfectants by supplementing TIMP, which should inhibit collagen degradation by MMPs secreted from themselves. Addition of TIMP-1 clearly restored the impaired growth of transfectants (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, TIMP-2 unexpectedly tended to augment, although marginally (p = 0.194 at 1 μg/ml), the growth suppression effect of siRNAgp46 (Fig. 5A). To ascertain the role of endogenous TIMP-1 in the survival of aHSCs, TIMP-1 of these cells was silenced with siRNA (Fig. 5B). Firstly, we examined its effect on MMP activity of culture medium and found that the MMP activity of siRNATIMP-1-treated aHSCs was higher than that of non-transfectant (Fig. 5C). As expected, siRNATIMP-1 brought about a significant suppression of cell number (Fig. 5D) paralleling the increment of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5E). We next determined whether the activities of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 on aHSC survival, described above, can be ascribed to those of their target molecules, MMPs. Microarray assays for mRNA expression profiles of aHSCs revealed that mRNAs of MT1-MMP, MMP12, MMP2, and MMP23 were highly expressed (supplemental Table 3). When each of these mRNAs was silenced (Fig. 6A and B), only siRNA against MMP2 caused significant growth stimulation (Fig. 7A). By contrast, siRNA against MT1-MMP significantly suppressed the growth of aHSCs (Fig. 7, A and B) in accordance with the increment of apoptotic cells (Fig. 7C). The growth-promoting activity of MT1-MMP was confirmed by the result that the growth of aHSCs was suppressed significantly by TIMP-2 (Fig. 7D), which supposedly inhibits MT1-MMP activity. Although MMP9 has been reported previously to suppress the growth of aHSCs when added to the culture medium (15Zhou X. Murphy F.R. Gehdu N. Zhang J. Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 23996-24006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), mRNA of MMP9 was not increased in aHSCs (supplemental Table 3), and silencing of this mRNA resulted in no significant growth retardation (Fig. 7A).FIGURE 7Effects of silencing of MMPs on proliferation or apoptosis induction and secretion of collagen by aHSCs.

Hypoxia, through known mechanisms, has profound effects on in vitro chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and could be used to improve the expansion and differentiation processes for DIAS cells. The objective of this study was to build upon the mechanistic knowledge of hypoxia and translate it to tissue engineering applications to enhance chondrogenic differentiation of DIAS cells through exposure to hypoxic conditions (5% O2) during expansion and/or differentiation. DIAS cells were isolated and expanded in hypoxic (5% O2) or normoxic (20% O2) conditions, then differentiated for 2 weeks in micromass culture on chondroitin sulfate-coated surfaces in both environments. Monolayer cells were examined for proliferation rate and colony forming efficiency. Micromasses were assessed for cellular, biochemical, and histological properties. Differentiation in hypoxic conditions following normoxic expansion increased per cell production of collagen type II 2.3 fold and glycosaminoglycans 1.2 fold relative to continuous normoxic culture (p<0.0001). Groups expanded in hypoxia produced 51% more collagen and 23% more GAGs than those expanded in normoxia (p<0.0001). Hypoxia also limited cell proliferation in monolayer and in 3D culture. Collectively, these data show hypoxic differentiation following normoxic expansion significantly enhances chondrogenic differentiation of DIAS cells, improving the potential utility of these cells for cartilage engineering."

This retrospective cohort analysis investigated 432 patients (259 men, 60%) who were newly diagnosed with ICH between January 2006 and June 2011 at the tertiary emergency center of Kitasato University Hospital. Median age on arrival was 67.0 years (range, 40–95 years). ICH was subcortical in 72 patients (16.7%), supratentorial in 233 (53.9%), and infratentorial in 133 (30.8%). PLT was performed in 16 patients (3.7%). Within 90 days after admission to the center, 178 patients (41.2%) had died due to ICH. Before the onset of ICH, 66 patients had been prescribed APA because of atherosclerotic diseases. Multivariate regression analysis indicated APA administration was an independent risk factor for death within 7 days (odds ratio, 5.12; P = 0.006) and within 90 days (hazard ratio, 1.87; P = 0.006) after arrival. Regarding the effect of a PLT in ICH patients with APA, no patient with PLT died. PLT had a survival benefit on patients with ICH, according to our analysis. Further prospective analysis is necessary to confirm the effects of PLT on survival in ICH with APA."
https://openalex.org/W1982648121,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a potent osteoinductive cytokine that plays a critical role in bone regeneration and repair. However, its distribution and side effects are major barriers to its success as therapeutic treatment. The improvement of therapy using collagen delivery matrices has been reported. To investigate a delivery system on postero-lateral spinal fusion, both engineered human BMP-2 with a collagen binding domain (CBD-BMP-2) and collagen scaffolds were developed and their combination was implanted into Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to study Lumbar 4–5 (L4–L5) posterolateral spine fusion. We divided SD rats into three groups, the sham group (G1, n = 20), the collagen scaffold-treated group (G2, n = 20) and the BMP-2-loaded collagen scaffolds group (G3, n = 20). 16 weeks after surgery, the spines of the rats were evaluated by X-radiographs, high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), manual palpation and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The results showed that spine L4–L5 fusions occurred in G2(40%) and G3(100%) group, while results from the sham group were inconsistent. Moreover, G3 had better results than G2, including higher fusion efficiency (X score, G2 = 2.4±0.163, G3 = 3.0±0, p<0.05), higher bone mineral density (BMD, G2: 0.3337±0.0025g/cm3, G3: 0.4353±0.0234g/cm3. p<0.05) and more bone trabecular formation. The results demonstrated that with site-specific collagen binding domain, a dose of BMP-2 as low as 0.02mg CBD-BMP-2/cm3 collagen scaffold could enhance the posterolateral intertransverse process fusion in rats. It suggested that combination delivery could be an alternative in spine fusion with dramatically decreased side effects caused by high dose of BMP-2."
https://openalex.org/W2018258068,"The functional role of efferent innervation of the vestibular end-organs in the inner ear remains elusive. This study provides the first physiological characterization of the cholinergic vestibular efferent (VE) neurons in the brainstem by utilizing a transgenic mouse model, expressing eGFP under a choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT)-locus spanning promoter in combination with targeted patch clamp recordings. The intrinsic electrical properties of the eGFP-positive VE neurons were compared to the properties of the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) brainstem neurons, which gives rise to efferent innervation of the cochlea. Both VE and the LOC neurons were marked by their negative resting membrane potential <-75 mV and their passive responses in the hyperpolarizing range. In contrast, the response properties of VE and LOC neurons differed significantly in the depolarizing range. When injected with positive currents, VE neurons fired action potentials faithfully to the onset of depolarization followed by sparse firing with long inter-spike intervals. This response gave rise to a low response gain. The LOC neurons, conversely, responded with a characteristic delayed tonic firing upon depolarizing stimuli, giving rise to higher response gain than the VE neurons. Depolarization triggered large TEA insensitive outward currents with fast inactivation kinetics, indicating A-type potassium currents, in both the inner ear-projecting neuronal types. Immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of Kv4.3 and 4.2 ion channel subunits in both the VE and LOC neurons. The difference in spiking responses to depolarization is related to a two-fold impact of these transient outward currents on somatic integration in the LOC neurons compared to in VE neurons. It is speculated that the physiological properties of the VE neurons might be compatible with a wide-spread control over motion and gravity sensation in the inner ear, providing likewise feed-back amplification of abrupt and strong phasic signals from the semi-circular canals and of tonic signals from the gravito-sensitive macular organs."
https://openalex.org/W1965628577,"In Côte d'Ivoire during 2004-2007, numbers of ART enrollees increased from <5,000 to 36,943. Trends in nationally representative ART program outcomes have not yet been reported.We conducted a retrospective chart review to assess trends in patient characteristics and attrition [death or loss to follow-up (LTFU)] over time, among a nationally representative sample of 3,682 adults (≥15 years) initiating ART during 2004-2007 at 34 health facilities. Among ART enrollees during 2004-2007, median age was 36, the proportion female was 67%, the proportion HIV-2-infected or dually HIV-1&2 reactive was 5%, and median baseline CD4+ T-cell (CD4) count was 135 cells/µL. Comparing cohorts initiating ART in 2004 with cohorts initiating ART in 2007, median baseline weight declined from 55 kg to 52 kg (p = 0.008) and the proportion weighing <45 kg increased from 17% to 22% (p = 0.014). During 2004-2007, pharmacy-based estimates of the percentage of new ART enrollees ≥95% adherent to ART declined from 74% to 60% (p = 0.026), and twelve-month retention declined from 86% to 69%, due to increases in 12-month mortality from 2%-4% and LTFU from 12%-28%. In univariate analysis, year of ART initiation was associated with increasing rates of both LTFU and mortality. Controlling for baseline CD4, weight, adherence, and other risk factors, year of ART initiation was still strongly associated with LTFU but not mortality. In multivariate analysis, weight <45 kg and adherence <95% remained strong predictors of LTFU and mortality.During 2004-2007, increasing prevalence among ART enrollees of measured mortality risk factors, including weight <45 kg and ART adherence <95%, might explain increases in mortality over time. However, the association between later calendar year and increasing LTFU is not explained by risk factors evaluated in this analysis. Undocumented transfers, political instability, and patient dissatisfaction with crowded facilities might explain increasing LTFU."
https://openalex.org/W1968660466,"Primary cilia regulate an expanding list of signaling pathways in many different cell types. It is likely that identification of the full catalog of pathways associated with cilia will be necessary to fully understand their role in regulation of signaling and the implications for diseases associated with their dysfunction, ciliopathies. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is one such ciliopathy which is characterized by a spectrum of phenotypes. These include neural defects such as impaired cognitive development, centrally mediated hyperphagia and peripheral sensory defects. Here we investigate potential defects in a signaling pathway associated with neuronal function, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. Upon loss of BBS4 expression in cultured cells, we observed decreased phosphorylation and activation by BDNF of its target receptor, TrkB. Assessment of ciliary localization revealed that, TrkB localized to the axonemes or basal bodies of cilia only in the presence of BDNF. Axonemal localization, specifically, was abrogated with loss of BBS4. Finally, we present evidence that loss of the ciliary axoneme through depletion of KIF3A impedes activation of TrkB. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility of a previously uninvestigated pathway associated with perturbation of ciliary proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1991305194,"The objective of this study was to determine the role of FIH-1 in regulating HIF-1 activity in the nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and the control of this regulation by binding and sequestration of FIH-1 by Mint3. FIH-1 and Mint3 were both expressed in the NP and were shown to strongly co-localize within the cell nucleus. Although both mRNA and protein expression of FIH-1 decreased in hypoxia, only Mint3 protein levels were hypoxiasensitive. Overexpression of FIH-1 was able to reduce HIF-1 function, as seen by changes in activities of hypoxia response element-luciferase reporter and HIF-1-C-TAD and HIF-2-TAD. Moreover, co-transfection of either full-length Mint3 or the N terminus of Mint3 abrogated FIH-1-dependent reduction in HIF-1 activity under both normoxia and hypoxia. Nuclear levels of FIH-1 and Mint3 decreased in hypoxia, and the use of specific nuclear import and export inhibitors clearly showed that cellular compartmentalization of overexpressed FIH-1 was critical for its regulation of HIF-1 activity in NP cells. Interestingly, microarray results after stable silencing of FIH-1 showed no significant changes in transcripts of classical HIF-1 target genes. However, expression of several other transcripts, including those of the Notch pathway, changed in FIH-1-silenced cells. Moreover, co-transfection of Notch-ICD could restore suppression of HIF-1-TAD activity by exogenous FIH-1. Taken together, these results suggest that, possibly due to low endogenous levels and/or preferential association with substrates such as Notch, FIH-1 activity does not represent a major mechanism by which NP cells control HIF-1-dependent transcription, a testament to their adaptation to a unique hypoxic niche."
https://openalex.org/W2126187295,"Understanding HIV transmission dynamics is critical to estimating the potential population-wide impact of HIV prevention and treatment interventions. We developed an individual-based simulation model of the heterosexual HIV epidemic in South Africa and linked it to the previously published Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) International Model, which simulates the natural history and treatment of HIV. In this new model, the CEPAC Dynamic Model (CDM), the probability of HIV transmission per sexual encounter between short-term, long-term and commercial sex worker partners depends upon the HIV RNA and disease stage of the infected partner, condom use, and the circumcision status of the uninfected male partner. We included behavioral, demographic and biological values in the CDM and calibrated to HIV prevalence in South Africa pre-antiretroviral therapy. Using a multi-step fitting procedure based on Bayesian melding methodology, we performed 264,225 simulations of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and identified 3,750 parameter sets that created an epidemic and had behavioral characteristics representative of a South African population pre-ART. Of these parameter sets, 564 contributed 90% of the likelihood weight to the fit, and closely reproduced the UNAIDS HIV prevalence curve in South Africa from 1990-2002. The calibration was sensitive to changes in the rate of formation of short-duration partnerships and to the partnership acquisition rate among high-risk individuals, both of which impacted concurrency. Runs that closely fit to historical HIV prevalence reflect diverse ranges for individual parameter values and predict a wide range of possible steady-state prevalence in the absence of interventions, illustrating the value of the calibration procedure and utility of the model for evaluating interventions. This model, which includes detailed behavioral patterns and HIV natural history, closely fits HIV prevalence estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1967432047,"As there is increasing evidence that aberrant defensin expression is related to susceptibility for infectious disease and inflammatory disorders, we sought to determine if copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster located on chromosome 8p23.1 (DEFB107, 106, 105, 104, 103, DEFB4 and SPAG11), that shows copy number variation as a block, was associated with susceptibility to otitis media (OM). The gene DEFB103 within this complex encodes human beta defensin-3 (hBD-3), an antimicrobial peptide (AP) expressed by epithelial cells that line the mammalian airway, important for defense of mucosal surfaces and previously shown to have bactericidal activity in vitro against multiple human pathogens, including the three that predominate in OM. To this end, we conducted a retrospective case-control study of 113 OM prone children and 267 controls aged five to sixty months. We identified the copy number of the above defined beta-defensin gene cluster (DEFB-CN) in each study subject by paralogue ratio assays. The mean DEFB-CN was indistinguishable between subjects classified as OM prone based on a recent history of multiple episodes of OM and control subjects who had no history of OM (4.4 ± 0.96 versus 4.4 ± 1.08, respectively: Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.16 (95% CI: 0.61, 2.20). Despite a lack of direct association, we observed a statistically significant correlation between DEFB-CN and nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization patterns. Collectively, our findings suggested that susceptibility to OM might be mediated by genetic variation among individuals, wherein a DEFB-CN less than 4 exerts a marked influence on the microbiota of the nasopharynx, specifically with regard to colonization by the three predominant bacterial pathogens of OM."

Individually, each NHERF protein has been shown to be involved in the regulation of multiple receptors or transporters including Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3). Although NHERF dimerizations have been reported, results have been inconsistent, and the physiological function of NHERF dimerizations is still unknown. The current study semiquantitatively compared the interaction strength among all possible homodimerizations and heterodimerizations of these three NHERF proteins by pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Both methods showed that NHERF2 and NHERF3 heterodimerize as the strongest interaction among all NHERF dimerizations. In vivo NHERF2/NHERF3 heterodimerization was confirmed by FRET and FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleach). NHERF2/NHERF3 heterodimerization is mediated by PDZ domains of NHERF2 and the C-terminal PDZ domain recognition motif of NHERF3. The NHERF3-4A mutant is defective in heterodimerization with NHERF2 and does not support the inhibition of NHE3 by carbachol. This suggests a role for NHERF2/NHERF3 heterodimerization in the regulation of NHE3 activity. In addition, both PDZ domains of NHERF2 could be simultaneously occupied by NHERF3 and another ligand such as NHE3, α-actinin-4, and PKCα, promoting formation of NHE3 macrocomplexes. This study suggests that NHERF2/NHERF3 heterodimerization mediates the formation of NHE3 macrocomplexes, which are required for the inhibition of NHE3 activity by carbachol."

Studies on predictors of adverse health outcome following DP are sparse. This study aimed to examine the association of different socio-demographic factors and health care consumption with subsequent suicidal behaviour among individuals on DP due to CMD.This is a population-based prospective cohort study based on register data. All individuals aged 18-64 years, living in Sweden on 31-Dec-2004 who in 2005 were on DP due to CMD (N = 46 745) were followed regarding suicide attempt and suicide (2006-10). Univariate and multivariate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for suicidal behaviour were estimated by Cox regression.During the five-year follow-up, 1 046 (2.2%) and 210 (0.4%) individuals attempted and committed suicide, respectively. Multivariate analyses showed that young age (18-24 years) and low education predicted suicide attempt, while living alone was associated with both higher suicide attempt and suicide (range of HRs 1.23 to 1.68). Combined prescription of antidepressants with anxiolytics during 2005 and inpatient care due to mental diagnoses or suicide attempt (2001-05) were strongly associated with suicide attempt and suicide (range of HRs 1.3 to 4.9), while inpatient care due to somatic diagnoses and specialized outpatient care due to mental diagnoses during 2001-05 only predicted suicide attempt (HR 1.45; 95% CI: 1.3-1.7; HR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7).Along with socio-demographic factors, it is very important to consider type of previous healthcare use and medication history when designing further research or intervention aiming at individuals on DP due to CMD.

https://openalex.org/W2949647620,"Colorectal tumors originate and develop within intestinal crypts. Even though some of the essential phenomena that characterize crypt structure and dynamics have been effectively described in the past, the relation between the differentiation process and the overall crypt homeostasis is still only partially understood. We here investigate this relation and other important biological phenomena by introducing a novel multiscale model that combines a morphological description of the crypt with a gene regulation model: the emergent dynamical behavior of the underlying gene regulatory network drives cell growth and differentiation processes, linking the two distinct spatio-temporal levels. The model relies on a few a priori assumptions, yet accounting for several key processes related to crypt functioning, such as: dynamic gene activation patterns, stochastic differentiation, signaling pathways ruling cell adhesion properties, cell displacement, cell growth, mitosis, apoptosis and the presence of biological noise. We show that this modeling approach captures the major dynamical phenomena that characterize the regular physiology of crypts, such as cell sorting, coordinate migration, dynamic turnover, stem cell niche correct positioning and clonal expansion. All in all, the model suggests that the process of stochastic differentiation might be sufficient to drive the crypt to homeostasis, under certain crypt configurations. Besides, our approach allows to make precise quantitative inferences that, when possible, were matched to the current biological knowledge and it permits to investigate the role of gene-level perturbations, with reference to cancer development. We also remark the theoretical framework is general and may be applied to different tissues, organs or organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1983804672,"The edible mushroom Volvariella volvacea is an important crop in Southeast Asia and is predominantly harvested in the egg stage. One of the main factors that negatively affect its yield and value is the rapid transition from the egg to the elongation stage, which has a decreased commodity value and shelf life. To improve our understanding of the changes during stipe development and the transition from egg to elongation stage in particular, we analyzed gene transcription in stipe tissue of V. volvacea using 3′-tag based digital expression profiling. Stipe development turned out to be fairly complex with high numbers of expressed genes, and regulation of stage differences is mediated mainly by changes in expression levels of genes, rather than on/off modulation. Most explicit is the strong up-regulation of cell division from button to egg, and the very strong down-regulation hereof from egg to elongation, that continues in the maturation stage. Button and egg share cell division as means of growth, followed by a major developmental shift towards rapid stipe elongation based on cell extension as demonstrated by inactivation of cell division throughout elongation and maturation. Examination of regulatory genes up-regulated from egg to elongation identified three potential high upstream regulators for this switch. The new insights in stipe dynamics, together with a series of new target genes, will provide a sound base for further studies on the developmental mechanisms of mushroom stipes and the switch from egg to elongation in V. volvacea in particular."
https://openalex.org/W2072422711,"Prion disease is caused by a single pathogenic protein (PrPSc), an abnormal conformer of the normal cellular prion protein PrPC. Depletion of PrPC in prion knockout mice makes them resistant to prion disease. Thus, gene silencing of the Prnp gene is a promising effective therapeutic approach. Here, we examined adeno-associated virus vector type 2 encoding a short hairpin RNA targeting Prnp mRNA (AAV2-PrP-shRNA) to suppress PrPC expression both in vitro and in vivo. AAV2-PrP-shRNA treatment suppressed PrP levels and prevented dendritic degeneration in RML-infected brain aggregate cultures. Infusion of AAV2-PrP-shRNA-eGFP into the thalamus of CD-1 mice showed that eGFP was transported to the cerebral cortex via anterograde transport and the overall PrPC levels were reduced by ∼ 70% within 4 weeks. For therapeutic purposes, we treated RML-infected CD-1 mice with AAV2-PrP-shRNA beginning at 50 days post inoculation. Although AAV2-PrP-shRNA focally suppressed PrPSc formation in the thalamic infusion site by ∼ 75%, it did not suppress PrPSc formation efficiently in other regions of the brain. Survival of mice was not extended compared to the untreated controls. Global suppression of PrPC in the brain is required for successful therapy of prion diseases."

Albuminuria, reflecting glomerular damage, is usually measured, but non-albumin proteinuria (NAP), reflecting tubular damage, may be important. This study investigated the prevalence and associations of albuminuria and NAP, and the optimum number of urine specimens required. Methods 1,741 patients with CKD stage 3, recruited from primary care, underwent medical history, clinical assessment, blood sampling, and submitted three early morning urine samples for albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) and protein to creatinine ratios (uPCR). Albuminuria was defined as uACR ≥3 mg/mmol in at least two of three samples. Isolated NAP was defined as uPCR ≥17 mg/mmol in two of three samples and uACR <3 mg/mmol in all three. Prevalence and associations of albuminuria and NAP, degree of agreement between single uACR and average of three uACRs, and urine albumin to protein ratio (uAPR = uACR/uPCR) were identified. Results Albuminuria prevalence was 16% and NAP 6%. Using a <1 mg/mmol threshold for uACR reduced NAP prevalence to 3.6%. Independent associations of albuminuria were: males (OR 3.06 (95% CI, 2.23–4.19)), diabetes (OR 2.14 (1.53–3.00)), lower estimated glomerular filtration rate ((OR 2.06 (1.48–2.85) 30–44 vs 45–59), and high sensitivity CRP ((OR 1.70 (1.25–2.32)). NAP was independently associated with females (OR 6.79 (3.48–13.26)), age (OR 1.62 (1.02–2.56) 80 s vs 70–79) and high sensitivity CRP ((OR 1.74 (1.14–2.66)). Of those with uPCR≥17 mg/mmol, 62% had uAPR<0.4. Sensitivity of single uACR was 95%, specificity 98%, PPV 90%. Bland Altman plot one vs average of three uACRs showed: mean difference 0.0064 mg/mmol (SD 4.69, limits of agreement −9.19 to +9.20, absolute mean difference 0.837). Conclusions In CKD stage 3, albuminuria has associations distinct from those of isolated NAP (except for inflammatory markers). Single uACR categorised albuminuria but average of three performed better for quantification."

However, few researches have reported the association of Tim-3 genetic variants with susceptibility and progression of HBV infection. In this study, we focused on the association of Tim-3 polymorphisms with HBV infection, HBsAg seroclearance and hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods A total of 800 subjects were involved in this study. Four groups were studied here, including HBV, HBsAg seroclearance, HBV-associated HCC and healthy controls. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Tim-3, rs246871, rs25855 and rs31223 were genotyped to analyze the association of Tim-3 polymorphisms with susceptibility and disease progression of HBV infection. Results Our study found that rs31223 and rs246871 were associated with disease progression of HBV infection, while none of the three SNPs was relevant to HBV susceptibility. The minor allele “C” of rs31223 was found to be associated with an increased probability of HBsAg seroclearance (P = 0.033) and genotype “CC” of rs246871 to be associated with an increased probability of HBV-associated HCC (P = 0.007). In accordance, haplotypic analysis of the three polymorphisms also showed that the haplotype block CGC* and TGC* were significantly associated with HBsAg seroclearance (P<0.05) while haplotype block CAT*, CGT*, TAC* and TGT* were significantly associated with HBV-associated HCC (all P<0.05). Conclusions Genetic variants of Tim-3 have an important impact on disease progression of HBV infection. With specific Tim-3 polymorphisms, patients infected with HBV could be potential candidates of HCC and HBsAg seroclearance."

The cells of the thyroid tissue are strongly sensitive to hypogravity, as already proven in mice after returning to the earth from long-term space missions. Here we studied whether hypergravity may be used to counteract the physiological deconditioning of long-duration spaceflight. We investigated the influence of hypergravity on key lipids and proteins involved in thyroid tissue function. We quantified cholesterol (CHO) and different species of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide, analysed thyrotropin (TSH) related molecules such as thyrotropin-receptor (TSHR), cAMP, Caveolin-1 and molecule signalling such as Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). The hypergravity treatment resulted in the upregulation of the TSHR and Caveolin-1 and downregulation of STAT3 without changes of cAMP. TSHR lost its specific localization and spread throughout the cell membrane; TSH treatment facilitated the shedding of α subunit of TSHR and its releasing into the extracellular space. No specific variations were observed for each species of SM and ceramide. Importantly, the level of CHO was strongly reduced. In conclusion, hypergravity conditions induce change in CHO and TSHR of thyroid gland. The possibility that lipid rafts are strongly perturbed by hypergravity-induced CHO depletion by influencing TSH-TSHR interaction was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2037395793,"Background The Indigenous population of Australia suffers considerable disadvantage across a wide range of socio-economic indicators, and is therefore the focus of many policy initiatives attempting to ‘close the gap’ between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Unfortunately, past population estimates have proved unreliable as denominators for these indicators. The aim of the paper is to contribute more robust estimates for the Northern Territory Indigenous population for the period 1966–2011, and hence estimate one of the most important of socio-economic indicators, life expectancy at birth. Method A consistent time series of population estimates from 1966 to 2011, based off the more reliable 2011 official population estimates, was created by a mix of reverse and forward cohort survival. Adjustments were made to ensure sensible sex ratios and consistency with recent birth registrations. Standard life table methods were employed to estimate life expectancy. Drawing on an approach from probabilistic forecasting, confidence intervals surrounding population numbers and life expectancies were estimated. Results The Northern Territory Indigenous population in 1966 numbered between 23,800 and 26,100, compared to between 66,100 and 73,200 in 2011. In 1966–71 Indigenous life expectancy at birth lay between 49.1 and 56.9 years for males and between 49.7 and 57.9 years for females, whilst by 2006–11 it had increased to between 60.5 and 66.2 years for males and between 65.4 and 70.8 for females. Over the last 40 years the gap with all-Australian life expectancy has not narrowed, fluctuating at about 17 years for both males and females. Whilst considerable progress has been made in closing the gap in under-five mortality, at most other ages the mortality rate differential has increased. Conclusions A huge public health challenge remains. Efforts need to be redoubled to reduce the large gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians."

We investigated copeptin during the menstrual cycle and its relationship to sex hormones, markers of subclinical inflammation and estimates of body fluid.In 15 healthy women with regular menstrual cycles, blood was drawn on fifteen defined days of their menstrual cycle and was assayed for copeptin, progesterone, estradiol, luteinizing hormone, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and procalcitonin. Symptoms of fluid retention were assessed on each visit, and bio impedance analysis was measured thrice to estimate body fluid changes. Mixed linear model analysis was performed to assess the changes of copeptin across the menstrual cycle and the relationship of sex hormones, markers of subclinical inflammation and estimates of body fluid with copeptin.Copeptin levels did not significantly change during the menstrual cycle (p = 0.16). Throughout the menstrual cycle, changes in estradiol (p = 0.002) and in the physical premenstrual symptom score (p = 0.01) were positively related to copeptin, but changes in other sex hormones, in markers of subclinical inflammation or in bio impedance analysis-estimated body fluid were not (all p = ns).Although changes in estradiol and the physical premenstrual symptom score appear to be related to copeptin changes, copeptin does not significantly change during the menstrual cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2039182123,"Previous research has shown that loading information on working memory affects selective attention. However, whether the load effect on selective attention is domain-general or domain-specific remains unresolved. The domain-general effect refers to the findings that load in one content (e.g. phonological) domain in working memory influences processing in another content (e.g., visuospatial) domain. Attentional control supervises selection regardless of information domain. The domain-specific effect refers to the constraint of influence only when maintenance and processing operate in the same domain. Selective attention operates in a specific content domain. This study is designed to resolve this controversy. Across three experiments, we manipulated the type of representation maintained in working memory and the type of representation upon which the participants must exert control to resolve conflict and select a target into the focus of attention. In Experiments 1a and 1b, participants maintained digits and nonverbalized objects, respectively, in working memory while selecting a target in a letter array. In Experiment 2, we presented auditory digits with a letter flanker task to exclude the involvement of resource competition within the same input modality. In Experiments 3a and 3b, we replaced the letter flanker task with an object flanker task while manipulating the memory load on object and digit representation, respectively. The results consistently showed that memory load modulated distractibility only when the stimuli of the two tasks were represented in the same domain. The magnitude of distractor interference was larger under high load than under low load, reflecting a lower efficacy of information prioritization. When the stimuli of the two tasks were represented in different domains, memory load did not modulate distractibility. Control of processing priority in selective attention demands domain-specific resources."
https://openalex.org/W2040367443,"Introduction There has been much interest in spatial analysis of ALS to identify potential environmental or genetically caused clusters of disease. Results to date have been inconclusive. The Irish ALS register has been recently geocoded, presenting opportunity to perform a spatial analysis on national prospectively gathered data of incident cases over an 18-year period. Methods 1,645 cases of ALS in Ireland from January 1995 to July 2013 were identified from the Irish ALS register. 1,638 cases were successfully geocoded. Census data from four censuses: 1996, 2002, 2006 & 2011 were used to calculate an average population for the period and standardized incidence rates (SIRs) were calculated for 3,355 areas (Electoral Divisions). Bayesian conditional auto-regression was applied to produce smoothed relative risks (RR). These were then mapped for all cases, males & females separately, and those under 55 vs over 55 at diagnosis. Bayesian and linear regression were used to examine the relationship between population density and RR. Results Smoothed maps revealed no overall geographical pattern to ALS incidence in Ireland, although several areas of localized increased risk were identified. Stratified maps also suggested localized areas of increased RR, while dual analysis of the relationship between population density and RR of ALS yielded conflicting results, linear regression revealed a weak relationship. Discussion In contrast to some previous studies our analysis did not reveal any large-scale geographic patterns of incidence, yet localized areas of moderately high risk were found in both urban and rural areas. Stratified maps by age revealed a larger number of cases in younger people in the area of County Cork - possibly of genetic cause. Bayesian auto-regression of population density failed to find a significant association with risk, however weighted linear regression of post Bayesian smoothed Risk revealed an association between population density and increased ALS risk."
https://openalex.org/W1964225425,"HARP (SMARCAL1, MARCAL1) is an annealing helicase that functions in the repair and restart of damaged DNA replication forks through its DNA branch migration and replication fork regression activities. HARP is conserved among metazoans. HARP from invertebrates differs by the absence of one of the two HARP-specific domain repeats found in vertebrates. The annealing helicase and branch migration activity of invertebrate HARP has not been documented. We found that HARP from Drosophila melanogaster retains the annealing helicase activity of human HARP, the ability to disrupt D-loops and to branch migrate Holliday junctions, but fails to regress model DNA replication fork structures. A comparison of human and Drosophila HARP on additional substrates revealed that both HARPs are competent in branch migrating a bidirectional replication bubble composed of either DNA:DNA or RNA:DNA hybrid. Human, but not Drosophila, HARP is also capable of regressing a replication fork structure containing a highly stable poly rG:dC hybrid. Persistent RNA:DNA hybrids in vivo can lead to replication fork arrest and genome instability. The ability of HARP to strand transfer hybrids may signify a hybrid removal function for this enzyme, in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2031322777,"The crucial role of structural support fulfilled by keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) in surface epithelia likely requires that they be organized into cross-linked networks. For IFs comprised of keratins 5 and 14 (K5 and K14), which occur in basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, formation of cross-linked bundles is, in part, self-driven through cis-acting determinants. Here, we targeted the expression of a bundling-competent KRT5/KRT8 chimeric cDNA (KRT8bc) or bundling-deficient wild type KRT8 as a control to the epidermal basal layer of Krt5-null mice to assess the functional importance of keratin IF self-organization in vivo. Such targeted expression of K8bc rescued Krt5-null mice with a 47% frequency, whereas K8 completely failed to do so. This outcome correlated with lower than expected levels of K8bc and especially K8 mRNA and protein in the epidermis of E18.5 replacement embryos. Ex vivo culture of embryonic skin keratinocytes confirmed the ability of K8bc to form IFs in the absence of K5. Additionally, electron microscopy analysis of E18.5 embryonic skin revealed that the striking defects observed in keratin IF bundling, cytoarchitecture, and mitochondria are partially restored by K8bc expression. As young adults, viable KRT8bc replacement mice develop alopecia and chronic skin lesions, indicating that the skin epithelia are not completely normal. These findings are consistent with a contribution of self-mediated organization of keratin IFs to structural support and cytoarchitecture in basal layer keratinocytes of the epidermis and underscore the importance of context-dependent regulation for keratin genes and proteins in vivo.

A corollary from this prediction is that targeted expression of the K8bc chimera, but not wild type K8, to basal layer keratinocytes should rescue the extensive skin blistering and perinatal lethality phenotype of mice carrying a null mutation at the Krt5 locus (33Peters B.

Relative transgene copy number across lines was determined using PCR with the following primer sets: 5′-CCTGGTCATCATCCTGCC-3′ (rabbit β-globin gene intron), 5′-GGACTTCTGGGTCACCCTGATGG-3′ (KRT8), 5′-AGGTAGGTGGCCAGGCGGTC-3′ (Krt16 forward), and 5′-CCACACCCACAGATCTGGGC-3′ (Krt16 reverse). Band intensity was measured using ImageJ and is reported relative to the Krt16 locus used as a stable internal reference. All subsequent progeny were genotyped using AccustartTM II mouse genotyping kit (Quanta Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the primers 5′-TGCATATAAATTCTGGCTGGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCATGAACATGGTTAGCAGAGGG-3′ (reverse), which are directed to the rabbit β-globin intron contained within the expression vector. Krt5-null mice were described previously (33Peters B. Kirfel J. Büssow H. Vidal M. Magin T.M.

These mice were genotyped using a multiplex PCR assay using the universal forward primer 5′-CCCACTAATCATTCACAGCTCG-3′, Krt5 reverse primer 5′-ACCAAAACCAAATCCACTGCCG-3′, and HPRT reverse primer 5′-CGAGTCTGAAGCTCTCGATTTCC-3′. Replacement mice were generated by breeding KRT8bcTg/− or KRT8Tg/− mice with Krt5+/− mice to yield KRT8bcTg/−Krt5+/− or KRT8Tg/−Krt5+/− mice, respectively. These mice were then bred with Krt5+/− mice to yield the following genotypes: Krt5+/+ or Krt5+/− (control), KRT8bcTg/− Krt5+/+ or KRT8Tg/−Krt5+/+ (referred to herein as KRT8bc or KRT8 transgenic mice), Krt5−/− (Krt5-null), and KRT8bcTg/−Krt5−/− or KRT8Tg/−Krt5−/− (referred to herein as KRT8bc or KRT8 replacement mice). All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism software. One- or two-way analyses of variance were used to test for significance where appropriate, and adjusted p values are reported. Plasmids pET-K5 and pET-K8 (30Lee C.H. Coulombe P.A. Self-organization of keratin intermediate filaments into cross-linked networks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) to produce the corresponding recombinant proteins as inclusion bodies (30Lee C.H. Coulombe P.A. Self-organization of keratin intermediate filaments into cross-linked networks.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. Elucidating the early stages of keratin filament assembly.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (10Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. A ‘hot-spot’ mutation alters the mechanical properties of keratin filament networks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. Pairwise assembly determines the intrinsic potential for self-organization and mechanical properties of keratin filaments.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using HiTrap Q and Mono Q ion exchange chromatography columns (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad), and serial dilutions were performed to yield standards of known concentration for analyses outlined below. For analysis of transgene expression in development stage 18.5 (E18.5) embryos, pregnant mice were sacrificed 18 days post-timed mating, and the skins of the embryos were harvested. Skins were chopped repeatedly with a razor blade, and urea-soluble proteins were then extracted as described previously (37Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. Directed expression of keratin 16 to the progenitor basal cells of transgenic mouse skin delays skin maturation.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1035-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). High salt extractions were performed using E18.5 embryonic skin samples as described (38Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Moll R. Winter S. Schmid E. Engelbrecht I. Denk H. Krepler R. Platzer B. Diversity of cytokeratins. Differentiation specific expression of cytokeratin polypeptides in epithelial cells and tissues.J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 933-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). To determine expression levels of endogenous K5 protein and of transgenic proteins, standards of known concentration were run alongside E18.5 samples. Otherwise, equal quantities of protein from genotypes of interest were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked, and antibody incubations were performed in 5% milk in 1× TBS-Tween 20. Protein epitopes were detected with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-K5 AF-138 (Covance), rabbit anti-K14 AF-64 (Covance), rabbit anti-Hsp70/Hsp72 ADI-SPA-812 (Enzo Life Sciences), chicken anti-K8 ab107115 (Abcam), rabbit anti-K17 (39McGowan K.M. Coulombe P.A. Onset of keratin 17 expression coincides with the definition of major epithelial lineages during skin development.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 469-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-GAPDH antibody sc-365062 (Santa Cruz Biosciences). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-chicken, and goat anti-mouse. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit and were imaged with FluorChem® Q MultiImage III (Alpha Innotech). Band signal intensity was measured from these images with the AlphaView® Q software. The standard curve line of best fit equation and R2 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism. Calculation of K5, K8bc, and K8 quantities was performed using the standard curve equations in Microsoft Excel. For analysis of transgenic protein expression in adult animals, wild type and transgenic animals were sacrificed at 6 weeks of age, and the back skins were harvested. The tissue was snap frozen, and urea-soluble proteins were extracted as described previously (37Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. Directed expression of keratin 16 to the progenitor basal cells of transgenic mouse skin delays skin maturation.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1035-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of urea-soluble protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit and were imaged with FluorChem Q MultiImage III (Alpha Innotech). All images were inverted and cropped using ImageJ software. Total RNA from either 6-week-old adult animals or E18.5 embryos was isolated using TRIzol® reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using an iScriptTM cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR was carried out using SYBR® Green Real-Time PCR Master Mix from Invitrogen on a Bio-Rad C1000TM thermocycler and CFXTM Real-Time System. Primers used were directed toward KRT8 (5′-CAAGGTGTCCACCTCTGGC-3′ and 5′-ATAGCCGCCGCCCAGGCCA-3′), Krt14 (5′-AGCGGCAAGAGTGAGATTTCT-3′ and 5′-CCTCCAGGTTATTCTCCAGGG-3′), Actb (5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′), and Gapdh (5′-AAATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGT-3′ and 5′-ACTCCACGACATACTCAGCAC-3′). ΔCq and ΔΔCq for each target were determined by first subtracting the averaged Cq values for Actb and Gapdh from the Cq of the target and then by subtracting the ΔCq of the wild type sample from each of the other samples when applicable. Relative RNA quantity was calculated by taking 2−ΔCq, and relative -fold change was calculated by taking 2−ΔΔCq. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. Phenotypic adult KRT8bc replacement and control mice were harvested at various ages for morphological study. Prior to sacrifice, images of the mice were taken with a Samsung Digimax S500 digital camera. Tissues analyzed included hairy skin, hairless skin (if present), ulcerative skin, tongue, forepaws, and tail. Tissues were fixed overnight in Bouin's fixative (Bio-Rad), dehydrated, and processed for paraffin embedding by AML Laboratories. Sections were cut 5 μm thick and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with an AxioCam HRc camera. Images were cropped, and scale bars were added in ImageJ. For analysis of cultured keratinocytes, E18.5 embryos were again harvested, and the skins were removed. The keratinocytes were isolated using a modified version of the protocol reported by Reichelt and Haase (40Reichelt J. Haase I. Establishment of spontaneously immortalized keratinocyte lines from wild-type and mutant mice.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 585: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After incubation with Dispase solution, keratinocytes were isolated as reported previously (41Bernot K.M. Lee C.H. Coulombe P.A. A small surface hydrophobic stripe in the coiled-coil domain of type I keratins mediates tetramer stability.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were cultured on collagen I-coated coverslips in CnT-57 medium (CELLnTEC) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the absence of 3T3-J2 feeder cells. Subconfluent coverslips were fixed with ice-cold methanol at −20 °C or with 3.3% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Coverslips fixed with paraformaldehyde were extracted with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Antibodies used to detect K5 and K14 were described above. K8 was detected with chicken anti-human K8 antibody ab14053 (Abcam). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst fluorescent dye. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera. For analysis of adult transgenic back skin, animals were harvested as described above and a portion of the back skin was embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. medium (Sakura) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 5-μm-thick frozen sections were cut and washed once with PBS buffer before probing with the antibodies described above. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with an AxioCam MRm camera. All images were cropped, and scale bars were added using ImageJ. Skins from 6-week-old adult animals or E18.5 embryos were harvested and immersed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde for 48 h. After primary fixation, tissue samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1"
https://openalex.org/W2007513384,"The Stroop effect is considered as a standard attentional measure to study conflict resolution in humans. The response of the brain to conflict is supposed to change over time and it is impaired in certain pathological conditions. Neuropsychological Stroop test measures have been complemented with electroencephalography (EEG) techniques to evaluate the mechanisms in the brain that underlie conflict resolution from the age of 20 to 70. To study the changes in EEG activity during life, we recruited a large sample of healthy subjects of different ages that included 90 healthy individuals, divided by age into decade intervals, which performed the Stroop test while recording a 14 channel EEG. The results highlighted an interaction between age and stimulus that was focused on the prefrontal (Alpha and Theta band) and Occipital (Alpha band) areas. We concluded that behavioural Stroop interference is directly influenced by opposing Alpha and Theta activity and evolves across the decades of life."
https://openalex.org/W2034627070,"Rhizosphere oxygen profiles are the key to understanding the role of wetland plants in ecological remediation. Though in situ determination of the rhizosphere oxygen profiles has been performed occasionally at certain growing stages within days, comprehensive study on individual roots during weeks is still missing. Seedlings of Acorus calamus, a wetland monocot, were cultivated in silty sediment and the rhizosphere oxygen profiles were characterized at regular intervals, using micro-optodes to examine the same root at four positions along the root axis. The rhizosphere oxygen saturation culminated at 42.9% around the middle part of the root and was at its lowest level, 3.3%, at the basal part of the root near the aboveground portion. As the plant grew, the oxygen saturation at the four positions remained nearly constant until shoot height reached 15 cm. When shoot height reached 60 cm, oxygen saturation was greatest at the point halfway along the root, followed by the point three-quarters of the way down the root, the tip of the root, and the point one-quarter of the way down. Both the internal and rhizosphere oxygen saturation steadily increased, as did the thickness of stably oxidized microzones, which ranged from 20 µm in younger seedlings to a maximum of 320 µm in older seedlings. The spatial patterns of rhizosphere oxygen profiles in sediment contrast with those from previous studies on radial oxygen loss in A. calamus that used conventional approaches. Rhizosphere oxygen saturation peaked around the middle part of roots and the thickness of stably oxidized zones increased as the roots grew."
https://openalex.org/W1967215579,"Electrical transmission signals have been used for decades to characterize the internal structure of composite materials. We theoretically analyze the transmission of an electrical signal through a composite material which consists of two phases with different chemical compositions. We assume that the temperature of the biphasic system increases as a result of Joule heating and its electrical resistivity varies linearly with temperature; this last consideration leads to simultaneously study the electrical and thermal effects. We propose a nonlinear conjugate thermo-electric model, which is solved numerically to obtain the current density and temperature profiles for each phase. We study the effect of frequency, resistivities and thermal conductivities on the current density and temperature. We validate the prediction of the model with comparisons with experimental data obtained from rock characterization tests."
