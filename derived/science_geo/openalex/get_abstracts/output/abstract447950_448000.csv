https://openalex.org/W2124833887,"Ruminants rely on a complex rumen microbial community to convert dietary plant material to energy-yielding products. Here we developed a method to simultaneously analyze the community's bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, ciliate 18S rRNA genes and anaerobic fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 genes using 12 DNA samples derived from 11 different rumen samples from three host species (Ovis aries, Bos taurus, Cervus elephas) and multiplex 454 Titanium pyrosequencing. We show that the mixing ratio of the group-specific DNA templates before emulsion PCR is crucial to compensate for differences in amplicon length. This method, in contrast to using a non-specific universal primer pair, avoids sequencing non-targeted DNA, such as plant- or endophyte-derived rRNA genes, and allows increased or decreased levels of community structure resolution for each microbial group as needed. Communities analyzed with different primers always grouped by sample origin rather than by the primers used. However, primer choice had a greater impact on apparent archaeal community structure than on bacterial community structure, and biases for certain methanogen groups were detected. Co-occurrence analysis of microbial taxa from all three domains of life suggested strong within- and between-domain correlations between different groups of microorganisms within the rumen. The approach used to simultaneously characterize bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic components of a microbiota should be applicable to other communities occupying diverse habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2148720840,"JARID1B (also known as KDM5B or PLU1) is a member of the JARID1 family of histone lysine demethylases responsible for the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K4me3), a mark for actively transcribed genes. JARID1B is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. In addition, JARID1B is required for mammary tumor formation in syngeneic or xenograft mouse models. JARID1B-expressing melanoma cells are associated with increased self-renewal character. Therefore, JARID1B represents an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here we characterized JARID1B using a homogeneous luminescence-based demethylase assay. We then conducted a high throughput screen of over 15,000 small molecules to identify inhibitors of JARID1B. From this screen, we identified several known JmjC histone demethylase inhibitors, including 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid and catechols. More importantly, we identified several novel inhibitors, including 2-4(4-methylphenyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (PBIT), which inhibits JARID1B with an IC50 of about 3 μm in vitro. Consistent with this, PBIT treatment inhibited removal of H3K4me3 by JARID1B in cells. Furthermore, this compound inhibited proliferation of cells expressing higher levels of JARID1B. These results suggest that this novel small molecule inhibitor is a lead compound that can be further optimized for cancer therapy.

Covalent posttranslational modification of histones on lysine tails is essential for gene regulation and DNA repair (1Blair L.P. Yan Q. Epigenetic mechanisms in commonly occurring cancers.DNA Cell Biol. 2012; 31: S49-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Histone lysine methylations are now widely accepted modifications for activating or silencing gene transcription, depending on the site and degree of methylation (2Blair L.P. Cao J. Zou M.R. Sayegh J. Yan Q. Epigenetic regulation by lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) enzymes in cancer.Cancers. 2011; 3: 1383-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For example, trimethylated lysine 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3) is associated with active transcription, whereas trimethylated lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27me3) is associated with gene silencing. The enzymes responsible for the demethylation of H3K4me3 are the Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1 (JARID1) 2The abbreviations used are: JARID1Jumonji AT-rich interactive domain 1KDM5lysine demethylase 5JmjCJumonji2,4-PDCA2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid monohydrateα-KGα-ketoglutaratebio-biotinylatedDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideHER2+HER2-positivePBIT2-4(4-methylphenyl)-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-oneUTXubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein X-linkedJMJD3JmjC domain-containing protein 3. or lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of lysine demethylases (3Klose R.J.

Cell. 2007; 25: 801-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This family consists of JARID1A (also known as KDM5A or RBP2), JARID1B (also known as KDM5B or PLU1), JARID1C (also known as KDM5C or SMCX), and JARID1D (also known as KDM5D or SMCY) in mammals (2Blair L.P.

Similar to other Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing demethylases, the JARID1 enzymes catalyze the demethylation of histones in an iron(II) and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent reaction (9Klose R.J. Zhang Y. Regulation of histone methylation by demethylimination and demethylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the oxidative decarboxylation of α-KG results in a hydroxylated methyl-lysine intermediate, which is thermodynamically unstable. The release of the hydroxyl and methyl groups as formaldehyde from this intermediate results in a demethylated lysine residue. Although all the JmjC domain histone demethylases catalyze the reaction via a similar mechanism, they clearly demonstrate specificity toward particular lysine residue(s) (10Hou H. Yu H. Structural insights into histone lysine demethylation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2010; 20: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

The JARID1 demethylases have been linked to human diseases such as cancer and X-linked mental retardation (2Blair L.P. Cao J. Zou M.R. Sayegh J. Yan Q. Epigenetic regulation by lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) enzymes in cancer.Cancers. 2011; 3: 1383-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both JARID1A and JARID1B are potential oncoproteins, and both are overexpressed in a variety of cancers (2Blair L.P. Cao J. Zou M.R. Sayegh J. Yan Q. Epigenetic regulation by lysine demethylase 5 (KDM5) enzymes in cancer.Cancers. 2011; 3: 1383-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Increased expression of JARID1A promotes a more stem-like phenotype and enhanced resistance to anticancer agents (11Sharma S.V. Lee D.Y. Li B. Quinlan M.P. Takahashi F. Maheswaran S. McDermott U.

Moreover, loss of JARID1A inhibits tumorigenesis in two genetically engineered mouse cancer models (12Lin W. Cao J. Liu J. Beshiri M.L. Fujiwara Y. Francis J. Cherniack A.D. Geisen C. Blair L.P.

JARID1B is highly expressed in human mammary tumors and breast cancer cell lines, but not in normal adult breast tissue (13Lu P.J. Sundquist K. Baeckstrom D. Poulsom R. Hanby A. Meier-Ewert S.

Taken together, both JARID1A and JARID1B enzymes are very attractive targets for cancer therapy (2Blair L.P. Cao J. Zou M.R. Sayegh J. Yan Q.

Even so, no specific inhibitor of these two epigenetic regulators is currently available, and the development of small molecule inhibitors is in demand. Until now, no high throughput screen has been reported for the JARID1 family of histone lysine demethylases. Small molecule inhibitor screens of other JmjC domain-containing demethylases employed methods including detection of the reaction byproduct formaldehyde (17Sakurai M. Rose N.R. Schultz L. Quinn A.M.

Screen. 2012; 17: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In these studies, α-KG analogues were reported to inhibit the JmjC demethylases (22Suzuki T. Miyata N. Lysine demethylases inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2011; 54: 8236-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One such analogue, 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDCA), has been shown to inhibit the catalytic core of JARID1B (23Kristensen L.H. Nielsen A.L. Helgstrand C. Lees M. Cloos P. Kastrup J.S. Helin K. Olsen L. Gajhede M. Studies of H3K4me3 demethylation by KDM5B/Jarid1B/PLU1 reveals strong substrate recognition in vitro and identifies 2,4-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid as an in vitro and in cell inhibitor.FEBS J. 2012; 279: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the specificity is likely compromised as these analogues may inhibit other Fe(II)- and α-KG-dependent enzymes, such as prolyl hydroxylases (22Suzuki T. Miyata N. Lysine demethylases inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2011; 54: 8236-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Here we describe a high throughput screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of full-length JARID1B using the AlphaScreen platform. By implementing AlphaScreen technology, we developed a very sensitive assay for detecting demethylation of a biotinylated (bio-) H3K4me3 peptide in vitro. We screened JARID1B against a diverse library consisting of 15,134 molecules and identified several compounds that yielded low μm IC50 values. One novel inhibitor, PBIT, inhibits JARID1B up to 95%, with an IC50 value of about 3 μm. This compound can also inhibit other members of the JARID1 family. It, however, did not inhibit the H3K27me3 demethylases ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein, X-linked (UTX) or JmjC domain-containing protein 3 (JMJD3), indicating that PBIT is specific for the JARID1 enzymes. Furthermore, this small molecule is able to modulate H3K4me3 levels in cells and attenuate proliferation of UACC-812 breast cancer cells. Taken together, these studies reveal the identification of novel inhibitors of JARID1B in vitro with therapeutic implications for breast cancer. C-terminal biotinylated peptides used in assays were as follows: H3K4me3 (ART-K(Me3)-GTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA-GGK(biotin)), H3K4me2 (ART-K(Me2)-GTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA-GGK(biotin)),H3K4me1 (ART-K(Me1)-QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLA-GGK(biotin)), H3K27me3 (ATKAAR-K(Me3)-SAPATGGVKKPHRYRPG-GK(biotin)), H3K27me2 (ATKAAR-K(Me2)-SAPATGGVKKPHRYPG-GK(biotin)), and H3K27me1(ATKAAR-K(Me1)-SAPATGGVKKPHRYRPG-GK(biotin)) were obtained from AnaSpec. Anti-H3K4me3 polyclonal antibody (ab8580), anti-H3K4me2 polyclonal antibody (ab7766), anti-H3K4me1 polyclonal antibody (ab8895), and anti-H3 polyclonal antibody (ab1791) were purchased from Abcam, and anti-H3K27me2 polyclonal antibody (07-452) was obtained from EMD Millipore. Anti-JARID1A monoclonal antibody (3876S) was purchased from Cell Signaling, anti-JARID1B polyclonal antibody (A301-813A) and anti-JARID1C polyclonal antibody (A301-035A) were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories, anti-UTX antibody (M30076) was from Abmart, and anti-HA antibody (MMS-101P) was from Covance. Sf21 insect cells were cultured in Grace's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. MCF7 and UACC-812 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Purification of these histone demethylases was confirmed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western blot analysis using the specific antibodies against these enzymes. Histone demethylase assays were performed in 384-well white plates (Corning 3574). Demethylase buffer conditions for FLAG-JARID1B were as follows: 10 μm α-KG, 100 μm ascorbate, 50 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The demethylase reactions included 64 nm bio-H3K4me3 peptide alone or in the presence of 4 nm FLAG-JARID1B enzyme in a 10-μl reaction at 25 °C for 30 min. As a positive control, 64 nm bio-H3K4me2 peptide was assayed in the absence of enzyme. Assay conditions for FLAG-JARID1C were the same as for FLAG-JARID1B except that 20 nm enzyme was used. For FLAG-JARID1A, the demethylase buffer was similar to FLAG-JARID1B except that 125 μm α-KG and 13 nm FLAG-JARID1A enzyme were used. The His-FLAG-UTX and FLAG-JMJD3 demethylase assays also employed the same buffer conditions as for FLAG-JARID1B, with 64 nm bio-H3K27me3 peptide assayed with or without 25 nm His-FLAG-UTX enzyme or 50 nm FLAG-JMJD3 (BPS Bioscience, 50115) and 64 nm bio-H3K27me2 peptide as a positive control. JARID1A, JARID1C, UTX, and JMJD3 histone demethylase assays proceeded at 37 °C for 1 h. The AlphaScreen general IgG (protein A) detection kit was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Demethylated H3K4 products were detected using AlphaScreen antibody/bead mix containing 7.5 mm EDTA and 0.15 μg/ml anti-H3K4me1 antibody in a final volume of 20 μl. For detection of demethylated H3K27 products, the AlphaScreen antibody/bead mix containing 7.5 mm EDTA and 0.15 μg/ml anti-H3K27me2 antibody in a final volume of 20 μl was used. The luminescence signal was measured using the Envision (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or Pherastar (BMG Labtech) plate readers. FLAG-JARID1B was screened against 15,134 compounds. These compound libraries were from the Yale Center for Molecular Discovery. The libraries screened include the MicroSource Gen-Plus, MicroSource Pure Natural Products, National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection, Enzo Epigenetics, Yale Compound, and ChemBridge MW-Set libraries, plus selected plates from the Maybridge Diversity, ChemBridge MicroFormats, DIVERSet, and ChemDiv libraries containing 8-hydroxyquinoline analogues. The first five libraries were screened twice, once with the standard demethylase assay condition and once with similar conditions except that 1 mm α-KG was used. Compounds dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added into a 384-well plate containing bio-H3K4me3 peptide in demethylase buffer to a final concentration of 20 μm. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 4 nm FLAG-JARID1B and detected as described above. To eliminate the false positive hits, a counter-screen was performed against bio-H3K4me2 in the absence of enzyme. IC50 values were generated from dose-response curves using 0.1–11 μm of compound and 15 or 50 μm Fe(II). PBIT (PH009215) and 2,4-PDCA (P63395) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DMSO (9224-01) was purchased from J.T. Baker. pcDNA3.1(−)-3×HA-JARID1B construct was generated by inserting 3×HA-JARID1B between BamHI and XbaI of pcDNA3.1(−) vector. MCF7 cells were plated on 12-mm-diameter coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected with pcDNA3.1(−)-3×HA-JARID1B in the presence of 0, 10, or 30 μm PBIT. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against HA and H3K4me3 for 2 h. The coverslips were then incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-546 (Invitrogen, A-11003) and goat anti-rabbit Envision (Dako, K4002) for 1 h. Cy5-Tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, NEL775001KT) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Biotium, 40011) were used to visualize 3×HA-tagged JARID1B and nuclei, respectively. The slides were sealed and analyzed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope. MCF7 cells treated with PBIT (10 μm) or DMSO (0.1%) for 72 h were harvested and lysed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Nuclei were spun down by centrifugation at 6,500 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.2 n HCl. The histones were extracted overnight, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. The samples were loaded onto 16% SDS-PAGE gels and probed with antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K4me1, and H3. The colorimetric assay (WST-1 reagent) from Roche Applied Science (11644807001) was performed in 96-well white clear bottom plates (Costar, 3610). 1,000 cells were seeded per well (in quadruplicate) overnight, and PBIT was added to the cells to the indicated concentration for 72 h. 0.01% DMSO was included as the control. The WST-1 reagent was added (5 μl/well) for 4 h, and absorbance at 440 nm (which reflects the number of viable cells) was measured with the BioTek Synergy Mx plate reader.

Primers specific for JARID1B were hPLU1F2 (CCATAGCCGAGCAGACTGG) and hPLU1R2 (GGATACGTGGCGTAAAATGAAGT). Primers specific for GAPDH were hGAPDHF (CGAGATCCCTCCAAAATCAA) and hGAPDHR (GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT). Primers specific for ACTB were described previously (27Yan Q. Bartz S. Mao M. Li L. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

To identify small molecule inhibitors of the JARID1B enzyme, AlphaScreen technology was employed to monitor JARID1B activity (Fig. 1A) (20Kawamura A. Tumber A. Rose N.R. King O.N. Daniel M. Oppermann U. Heightman T.D. Schofield C. Development of homogeneous luminescence assays for histone demethylase catalysis and binding.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 404: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In our demethylase assays, a biotinylated H3K4me3 peptide substrate underwent demethylation by JARID1B. The demethylated products (bio-H3K4me2/1) were detected by interaction with both streptavidin-coated donor beads (via biotin label) and protein A-coated acceptor beads (via interaction with the H3K4me2/1 antibody). Laser excitation leads to a luminescence signal that corresponds to the amount of bio-H3K4me2/1 and thus demethylase activity. Antibody optimization for the AlphaScreen assay in the absence of enzyme was performed using various antibodies against H3K4me2 and H3K4me1. Among these antibodies, the H3K4me1 antibody can generate homogeneous luminescence signals for both the bio-H3K4me1 and the bio-H3K4me2 peptides (Fig. 1B). More importantly, the signal for the bio-H3K4me1 peptide is about twice that of the bio-H3K4me2 peptide. Therefore, the AlphaScreen signal can also indicate the degree of demethylation. The FLAG-tagged full-length JARID1B enzyme was expressed in Sf21 insect cells using FLAG-JARID1B baculoviruses and affinity-purified using anti-FLAG antibody. FLAG-JARID1B was analyzed by SDS-PAGE for purity (Fig. 2A), and by Western blot for JARID1B expression (Fig. 2B). To assess the activity of FLAG-JARID1B, demethylase assays were performed in triplicate using AlphaScreen platform in the presence and absence of JARID1B (Fig. 3A). AlphaScreen signal is detected in demethylase assays performed in the presence of both the bio-H3K4me3 peptide and FLAG-JARID1B. Assays performed using only the bio-H3K4me2 peptide served as a positive control.FIGURE 3Characterization of JARID1B. A, enzymatic activity of FLAG-JARID1B (4 nm) as monitored by AlphaScreen signal in the presence and absence of bio-H3K4me3 peptide substrate (64 nm).

https://openalex.org/W2063225477,"Humans are highly adept at processing speech. Recently, it has been shown that slow temporal information in speech (i.e., the envelope of speech) is critical for speech comprehension. Furthermore, it has been found that evoked electric potentials in human cortex are correlated with the speech envelope. However, it has been unclear whether this essential linguistic feature is encoded differentially in specific regions, or whether it is represented throughout the auditory system. To answer this question, we recorded neural data with high temporal resolution directly from the cortex while human subjects listened to a spoken story. We found that the gamma activity in human auditory cortex robustly tracks the speech envelope. The effect is so marked that it is observed during a single presentation of the spoken story to each subject. The effect is stronger in regions situated relatively early in the auditory pathway (belt areas) compared to other regions involved in speech processing, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's region). To further distinguish whether speech envelope is encoded in the auditory system as a phonological (speech-related), or instead as a more general acoustic feature, we also probed the auditory system with a melodic stimulus. We found that belt areas track melody envelope weakly, and as the only region considered. Together, our data provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence that the envelope of speech is robustly tracked in non-primary auditory cortex (belt areas in particular), and suggest that the considered higher-order regions (STG and Broca's region) partake in a more abstract linguistic analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2037853495,"We introduce an automated method for the bottom-up reconstruction of the cognitive evolution of science, based on big-data issued from digital libraries, and modeled as lineage relationships between scientific fields. We refer to these dynamic structures as phylomemetic networks or phylomemies, by analogy with biological evolution; and we show that they exhibit strong regularities, with clearly identifiable phylomemetic patterns. Some structural properties of the scientific fields - in particular their density -, which are defined independently of the phylomemy reconstruction, are clearly correlated with their status and their fate in the phylomemy (like their age or their short term survival). Within the framework of a quantitative epistemology, this approach raises the question of predictibility for science evolution, and sketches a prototypical life cycle of the scientific fields: an increase of their cohesion after their emergence, the renewal of their conceptual background through branching or merging events, before decaying when their density is getting too low."

To identify signaling cascades that converge onto GABAergic postsynaptic density proteins, we performed MS analysis using gephyrin isolated from rat brain and identified multiple novel phosphorylation and acetylation residues on gephyrin.

https://openalex.org/W2031215649,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. We previously showed that the expression of dynactin 1, an axon motor protein regulating retrograde transport, is markedly reduced in spinal motor neurons of sporadic ALS patients, although the mechanisms by which decreased dynactin 1 levels cause neurodegeneration have yet to be elucidated. The accumulation of autophagosomes in degenerated motor neurons is another key pathological feature of sporadic ALS. Since autophagosomes are cargo of dynein/dynactin complexes and play a crucial role in the turnover of several organelles and proteins, we hypothesized that the quantitative loss of dynactin 1 disrupts the transport of autophagosomes and induces the degeneration of motor neuron. In the present study, we generated a Caenorhabditis elegans model in which the expression of DNC-1, the homolog of dynactin 1, is specifically knocked down in motor neurons. This model exhibited severe motor defects together with axonal and neuronal degeneration. We also observed impaired movement and increased number of autophagosomes in the degenerated neurons. Furthermore, the combination of rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, and trichostatin which facilitates axonal transport dramatically ameliorated the motor phenotype and axonal degeneration of this model. Thus, our results suggest that decreased expression of dynactin 1 induces motor neuron degeneration and that the transport of autophagosomes is a novel and substantial therapeutic target for motor neuron degeneration."

Here, we documented that methylene blue (MB) reverses the Warburg effect evidenced by the increasing of oxygen consumption and reduction of lactate production in GBM cell lines. MB decreases GBM cell proliferation and halts the cell cycle in S phase. Through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, MB inactivates downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase and decreases cyclin expression. Structure-activity relationship analysis demonstrated that toluidine blue O, an MB derivative with similar bioenergetic actions, exerts similar action in GBM cell proliferation. In contrast, two other MB derivatives, 2-chlorophenothiazine and promethazine, exert no effect on cellular bioenergetics and do not inhibit GBM cell proliferation. MB inhibits cell proliferation in both temozolomide-sensitive and -insensitive GBM cell lines. In a human GBM xenograft model, a single daily dosage of MB does not activate AMP-activated protein kinase signaling, and no tumor regression was observed.

In the current study we tested the hypothesis that reversal of the Warburg effect by MB inhibits GBM cell proliferation. We determined the effect of MB on GBM cell proliferation using multiple GBM cell lines and dissected its underlying signaling mechanisms. U87 MG (U87), A172, and T98G cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown on 10-cm culture plates (Greiner) in DMEM high glucose with pyruvate (Hyclone) and 10% FBS. Cells were cultured from passages 5 to 25 with media changed every 2–3 days. Human primary astrocyte cultures were gifts from Dr. Anuja Ghorpade (University of North Texas Health Science Center) and cultured as described previously (18Fields J. Gardner-Mercer J. Borgmann K. Clark I. Ghorpade A. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β expression is increased in the brain during HIV-1-infection and contributes to regulation of astrocyte tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1.J. Neurochem. 2011; 118: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MB was purchased from American Regent. Toluidine Blue O, promethazine, 2-chlorophenothiazine, rotenone, carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), oligomycin, EDTA, MgSO4, NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, NaN3, and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma. Propidium iodide was purchased from Calbiochem. U87 or other GBM cells were plated at a density of 30,000/well in an XF24 plate. Cells were allowed to grow overnight, and the media were exchanged 1 h before the assay for XF24 media. Rotenone, FCCP, and oligomycin were diluted into XF24 media and loaded into the accompanying cartridge to achieve final concentrations of 100 nm, 300 nm, and 1 μg/ml, respectively. Injections of the drugs into the medium occurred at the time points specified. Oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates were monitored using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. U87, A172, and T98G cells were seeded into 12-well culture plates (Greiner) at a concentration of 25,000 cells/well in 0.5 ml of DMEM with pyruvate (10% FBS). Drugs were added to each well to obtain the desired concentration in a final volume of 1 ml per well. Day of seeding was considered day 0. Plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were harvested on each indicated day using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and counted using an inverted phase contrast Zeiss Invertoskop microscope. Cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates (Greiner) at a concentration of 50 cells/well in 1 ml of DMEM with pyruvate (10% FBS). Drugs were added to each well to obtain the desired concentration in a final volume of 2 ml per well. Plates were incubated for 4 weeks undisturbed. Colonies were stained with crystal violet as follows. Culture plates were numbered for identification and placed on ice; colonies were gently washed 2× with ice-cold PBS; colonies were then fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min; methanol was aspirated from the wells, and the plates were moved to the bench-top where the colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 10 min; the crystal violet solution was removed, and the plates were washed by immersing in a bucket of cold tap water until the water ran clear; plates were then inverted on an absorbent pad and allowed to dry overnight. Stained colonies were counted, and the number and size were recorded. The soft agar colony anchorage independent assay was performed as described previously (19Cao J. Schulte J. Knight A. Leslie N.R. Zagozdzon A. Bronson R. Manevich Y. Beeson C. Neumann C.A. Prdx1 inhibits tumorigenesis via regulating PTEN/AKT activity.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). U87 cells at a density of 5000 cells/well were seeded into 6-well plates in a 0.6% agar DMEM solution containing vehicle or MB at the specified concentrations for a total media volume of 1.5 ml. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 weeks. The number of cells/well was determined by an independent researcher using an inverted phase contrast Zeiss Invertoskop. Colony diameter was determined by imaging colonies with a Zeiss Observer Z1and calculating the diameter of the colonies with Zeiss AxioVision software. ATP kit was purchased from Invitrogen. U87 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well. Cells were allowed to attach overnight. Media were removed and replaced with fresh media containing specified concentrations of MB. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the cells were trypsinized for 5 min and placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, centrifuged at 1200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and washed with PBS. The cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS twice more and finally lysed with 200 μl of ATP assay buffer (500 mm Tricine buffer, pH 7.8, 100 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm sodium azide) containing 1% Triton X-100. 10-μl cell lysate was added in triplicate to a white 96-well plate along with an ATP standard curve. Before reading the plate, 100 μl of ATP reaction buffer (30 μg/ml d-luciferin, 20 μm DTT, and 25 μg/ml Luciferase) was added to each well. Luminescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite F200 plate reader. Protein concentration was measured simultaneously using the Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (660 nm absorbance), and ATP production was normalized to protein content of the samples. Glucose was quantified using a manufactured kit from Sigma. In brief, 200,000 U87 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The following morning the media were replaced with 2 ml of fresh DMEM high glucose (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing the indicated concentrations of MB. After the allotted time, medium was removed and added to a 96-well plate proportionately (1:3) with glucose assay buffer containing glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and O-dianisidine. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at which point the enzymes were denatured with 12 n sulfuric acid. Absorbance was measured with a Tecan Infinite F200 plate reader at 540 nm. Lactate concentration in the media was measured by GEM 3000 analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory Co., Bedford, MA). NADP+ and NADPH were determined with an enzymatic cycling reaction assay (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, U87 cells were washed with PBS and extracted with NADP+/NADPH extraction buffer by homogenization. First, total NADP was measured with extract. Second, NADP from extract was decomposed by heating at 60 °C for 30 min in a heating block. Then, following the manufacturer's protocol, NADP+ and NADPH were detected at 450 nm and quantified with a standard curve. Values presented are the ratio of NADPH to total NADP (NADPH + NADP+). Cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well and attached overnight. The following day, the cells were deprived of FBS overnight to standardize the cell cycle followed by fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and the indicated concentration of MB. At the specified times, cells were harvested using 0.5% trypsin (Invitrogen) and washed with wash buffer (0.1% FBS in PBS) twice to remove trypsin. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol for 45 min at 4 °C. Ethanol was removed by washing twice with PBS, and the cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI) (40 μg/ml) and RNase (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed using Beckman Coulter FC500 Flow Cytometry Analyzer. U87 cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Cells attached overnight, and individual drugs were added to the cells in fresh media the following day at the indicated concentrations. Cells were grown for the indicated times and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysate was loaded onto a 6% (acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)) or 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with 5% milk for 1 h, nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C at the indicated concentrations (AMPKα, Cell Signaling, 1:500; P-AMPKα, Cell Signaling, 1: 500; AMPKβ, Cell Signaling, 1:500; P-AMPKβ, Cell Signaling, 1:500; ACC, 1:500, Cell Signaling; p-ACC, Cell Signaling, 1:500; mTOR, Cell Signaling, 1:500; P-mTOR, Cell Signaling, 1:500; Cyclin A2, Cell Signaling, 1:500; Cyclin B1, Cell Signaling, 1:750; Cyclin D1, Cell Signaling, 1:750; Cyclin E1, Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000; β-Actin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). Secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was incubated for 2 h at room temperature (1:2000). Chemiluminescence was detected with a UVP Biospectrum 500. Annexin V kit was purchased from BD Biosciences. U87 cells were seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/well in 6-well plates. The cells were treated with MB at the indicated concentrations for 3 days at which time the cells were harvested with 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) containing biotin-labeled annexin V (1:20 dilution). Cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer containing streptavidin-labeled FITC and PI at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After 20-min incubation in the dark, cells were analyzed with a Beckman Coulter FC500. All animal procedures conformed to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institute of Health guidelines. Female athymic mice (nu/nu genotype, Balb/c background, 6–8 weeks old) were used for all antitumor studies. The following patient-derived adult human glioblastoma xenografts, maintained at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at Duke, were used, and for the xenografts studies, D-08-0430 MG and D-09-0326 MG were used. For studies, subcutaneous xenografts passaged in athymic mice were excised from host mice under sterile conditions in a laminar flow containment hood. The xenograft was homogenized with the use of a tissue press/modified tissue cytosieve (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD). The tumor homogenate was then loaded into a repeating Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Co., Reno, NV) dispenser and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the athymic mouse at an inoculation volume of 50 μl with a 19-gauge needle (20Friedman H.S. Colvin O.M. Skapek S.X. Ludeman S.M. Elion G.B. Schold Jr., S.C. Jacobsen P.F. Muhlbaier L.H. Bigner D.D. Experimental chemotherapy of human medulloblastoma cell lines and transplantable xenografts with bifunctional alkylating agents.Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4189-4195PubMed Google Scholar). Subcutaneous tumors were measured twice weekly with handheld vernier calipers (Scientific Products, McGraw, IL). Tumor volumes, V, were calculated with the following formula: (width2 × length)/2 = V (mm3). For MB treatment, groups of mice randomly selected by tumor volume were treated when the median tumor volumes were on average 150 mm3 and compared with control animals receiving vehicle (saline). MB (10 and 50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were administered via gavage once a day until the tumor volume reach a volume 5 times greater than that measured at the start of the treatment (∼4 weeks) and was at least 1000 mm3. The response of sc xenografts to treatment was assessed by delay in tumor growth and by tumor regression. Growth delay, expressed as T-C, is defined as the difference in days between the median time required for tumors in treated (T) and control (C) animals to reach a volume five times greater than that measured at the start of the treatment. Tumor regression is defined as a decrease in tumor volume over two successive measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using a SAS statistical analysis program, the Wilcoxon rank order test for growth delay, and Fisher's exact test for tumor regression as previously described (20Friedman H.S. Colvin O.M. Skapek S.X. Ludeman S.M. Elion G.B. Schold Jr., S.C. Jacobsen P.F. Muhlbaier L.H. Bigner D.D.

A generalized Wilcoxon test for comparing arbitrarily singly-censored samples.Biometrika. 1965; 52: 203-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The significance of differences among groups with one independent variable was determined by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's multiple comparisons test for planned comparisons between groups when significance was detected. The significance of differences among groups where two independent variables were present was determined by two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-test for planned comparisons between groups when significance was detected. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. The cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of U87 cells, a glioblastoma cell line originated from a human female patient, were compared with primary female human astrocytes to determine the differences in cellular metabolism between cancerous and healthy cells. We observed that U87 cells have a 2-fold higher OCR when compared with primary astrocytes under normal culture conditions. However, when maximum cellular OCR capacity was induced by FCCP (i.e. mitochondria membrane uncoupler), both U87 cells and human primary astrocytes attained a similar OCR (Fig. 1A). ECAR, an indirect measurement of lactate production, was 3-fold higher in U87 cells compared with human astrocytes (Fig. 1B). We tested the effect of MB on metabolism at a dose range of 100 nm to 10 μm in U87 cells. Significantly increased OCR was observed with 1 μm MB, and a 2-fold increase occurred with 10 μm MB treatment (Fig. 1, C and E). In concurrence with the changes observed to cellular OCR, 1 and 10 μm MB significantly decreased ECAR, with 10 μm MB reducing ECAR up to 90% compared with control (Fig. 1, D and F). To determine the long term effect of MB on cellular bioenergetics of glioma cells, we treated U87 cells with 10 μm MB for 1 or 2 days and then measured the bioenergetic parameters of OCR, ECAR, and ATP production. Chronic treatment of 10 μm MB increased OCR after 1 day. OCR returned to control levels after 2 days (Fig. 2, A and C). U87 cells treated with MB were less responsive to mitochondria modulating drugs (oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone) than vehicle-treated U87 cells. Similar to acute MB treatment, ECAR levels were depressed compared with control for both day 1 and day 2 (Fig. 2, B and D). ATP levels were increased on days 1 and 2 compared with control cells (Fig. 2E). Consistent with the ECAR result, a decrease of lactate production upon MB treatment was observed at day 3 (Fig. 2F). To understand how MB alterations to cellular bioenergetics affect glioma proliferation, we measured cell growth and anchorage-dependent and -independent colony formation. MB effects on tumor growth were initially characterized in vitro using the glioblastoma cell lines U87 and A172, originated from a human female patient and a male patient, respectively. Concentrations of 1 and 10 μm MB significantly reduced U87 cell growth compared with vehicle control (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the inhibitory action of MB on U87 growth was observed when media were replaced every other day (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, no inhibitory action of MB on primary human astrocyte growth curve was observed (Fig. 3B). We determined the effect MB on glucose consumption. Media glucose was measured in U87 cells treated with vehicle or MB at concentrations of 100 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm. MB did not increase glucose consumption rate as glucose concentrations in the media remained similar at day 1 and day 2 in vehicle- and MB-treated U87 cells. At day 3, glucose concentrations in MB-treated U87 cells were significantly higher than that of vehicle treated cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, A172 cell growth was reduced by 1 and 10 μm MB (data not shown). To confirm the effects observed on cell growth, we employed an anchorage-dependent liquid colony culture (i.e. liquid colony formation) for 4 weeks, at the end of which the number and size of colonies was quantified. Consistently, MB at concentrations of 1 and 10 μm reduced both the average size and the number of colonies (Fig. 3, E–G). These results were further verified in an anchorage-independent (i.e. soft agar) colony growth assay, where 10 μm MB reduced the size and number of colonies (Fig. 3, H and I). We investigated the MB effect on cell cycle as a possible cause of the decreased growth rate we observed in glioma cells. U87 cells were subjected to overnight serum deprivation to synchronize cell cycle and then treated with MB or vehicle for 3 days. No significant effect of MB on cell cycle was observed on day 1 (Fig. 4A). However, on day 2, a trend of increased cell number in S phase occurred at a dose of 10 μm MB (Fig. 4B). By day 3, 10 μm MB significantly increased the number of cells in S phase and decreased the number of cells in G1 phase with no discernable change in M phase (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, an increase in cell death occurred in the 10 μm MB-treated group. To determine the effect of MB on glioma cell apoptosis, U87 cells were treated with MB for 3 days, then stained with annexin V and PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed that MB, at 10 μm, increased necrosis and late stage apoptosis in U87 cells evidenced by the augmented number of PI-positive and PI annexin V double-positive cells, respectively (Fig. 4E). We determined the effect of MB on cyclin expression in U87 cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 10 μm MB decreased expression of cyclin A2 and B1 compared with control after 2 and 3 days of treatment (Fig. 4F). In addition, 10 μm MB reduced cyclin D1 expression while having little discernable effect on cyclin E1. We investigated the phosphorylation of AMPKα at its activation site, Thr-172. Increased phosphorylation of AMPKα was observed after 2 and 3 days of 10 μm MB treatment (Fig. 5, A–C). Next we confirmed the effects of increased AMPK activation on the downstream targets ACC and mTOR. Increased phosphorylation of Ser-79 of ACC was observed in U87 cells treated with 10 μm MB for 2 and 3 days (Fig. 5, A, B, and D). On the other hand, no changes to mTOR Thr-2448 phosphorylation (inhibition) were observed (Fig. 5, A, B, and E). A recent study demonstrated that AMPK activation is associated with NADPH homeostasis (22Jeon S.M. Chandel N.S. Hay N. AMPK regulates NADPH homeostasis to promote tumour cell survival during energy stress.Nature. 2012; 485: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). MB decreased NADPH as a percentage of total NADP+ in U87 cells at 1 and 10 μm (Fig. 5F). We selected three MB derivatives to determine whether the inhibitory action of MB on glioma cell proliferation is associated with the observed reversal of the Warburg effect. Toluidine blue O (TB) has an exposed heterocyclic nitrogen and side chains on carbons 3, 7, and 9. 2-Chlorophenothiazine (2-C) contains only the heterocyclic nucleus. Promethazine (Pro) is an antihistamine composed of a side chain blocking its heterocyclic nitrogen. We determined the effects of MB derivatives on OCR and ECAR in U87 cells. TB dramatically increased OCR and decreased ECAR, whereas no effect was found by 2-C and Pro treatment (Fig. 6, A and B). We examined the effect of MB derivatives on the AMPK pathway. Similar to MB, TB increased phosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172"
https://openalex.org/W2017896922,"The most common sustained cardiac arrhythmias in humans are atrial tachyarrhythmias, mainly atrial fibrillation. Areas of complex fractionated atrial electrograms and high dominant frequency have been proposed as critical regions for maintaining atrial fibrillation; however, there is a paucity of data on the relationship between the characteristics of electrograms and the propagation pattern underlying them. In this study, a realistic 3D computer model of the human atria has been developed to investigate this relationship. The model includes a realistic geometry with fiber orientation, anisotropic conductivity and electrophysiological heterogeneity. We simulated different tachyarrhythmic episodes applying both transient and continuous ectopic activity. Electrograms and their dominant frequency and organization index values were calculated over the entire atrial surface. Our simulations show electrograms with simple potentials, with little or no cycle length variations, narrow frequency peaks and high organization index values during stable and regular activity as the observed in atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia (except in areas of conduction block) and in areas closer to ectopic activity during focal atrial fibrillation. By contrast, cycle length variations and polymorphic electrograms with single, double and fragmented potentials were observed in areas of irregular and unstable activity during atrial fibrillation episodes. Our results also show: 1) electrograms with potentials without negative deflection related to spiral or curved wavefronts that pass over the recording point and move away, 2) potentials with a much greater proportion of positive deflection than negative in areas of wave collisions, 3) double potentials related with wave fragmentations or blocking lines and 4) fragmented electrograms associated with pivot points. Our model is the first human atrial model with realistic fiber orientation used to investigate the relationship between different atrial arrhythmic propagation patterns and the electrograms observed at more than 43000 points on the atrial surface."

We previously reported that conditional deletion of Hdac3 in osteo-chondroprogenitor cells with Osx1-Cre caused severe osteopenia due to abnormal maturation of osteoblasts. The mice were also smaller. To address the abnormal longitudinal growth in these animals, the role of Hdac3 in chondrocyte differentiation was evaluated. We found that Hdac3 is highly expressed in resting and prehypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes, as well as in articular chondrocytes. Hdac3-deficient chondrocytes entered hypertrophy sooner and were smaller than normal chondrocytes. Extracellular matrix production was suppressed as glycosaminoglycan secretion and production of aggrecan, osteopontin, and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein were reduced in Hdac3-deficient chondrocytes. These phenotypes led to the hypothesis that the Akt/mTOR pathway was repressed in these Hdac3-deficient chondrocytes because Akt promotes hypertrophy and matrix production in many tissues. The phosphorylation and activation of Akt, its substrate mTOR, and the mTOR substrate, p70 S6 kinase, were indeed reduced in Hdac3-deficient primary chondrocytes as well as in chondrocytes exposed to HDAC inhibitors. Expression of constitutively active Akt restored phosphorylation of mTOR and p70 S6K and matrix gene expression levels. Reduced phosphorylation of Akt and its substrates in Hdac3-deficient or HDAC inhibitors treated chondrocytes correlated with increased expression of the phosphatase Phlpp1. Hdac3 associated with a Phlpp1 promoter region containing Smad binding elements and was released after TGFβ was added to the culture. These data demonstrate that Hdac3 controls chondrocyte hypertrophy and matrix content by repressing Phlpp1 expression and facilitating Akt activity.

Endochondral ossification is a complex developmental process by which long bones form and many fractures heal. This process begins with the condensation of mesenchymal progenitor cells, which differentiate into chondrocytes, and progresses to the production of a type II collagen- and proteoglycan-rich matrix. With further differentiation, chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and suppress type II collagen in favor of type X collagen. Ultimately, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis, the tissue becomes vascularized and osteoblasts and osteoclasts replace the cartilaginous matrix with a type I collagen-rich mineralized matrix. Akt is an influential intracellular serine kinase that orchestrates chondrogenesis (1Akiyama H. Furukawa S. Wakisaka S. Maeda T.

These animals are referred to as Hdac3-CKOOsx mice in this report and are on the C57Bl/6 genetic background. Animals were housed in an accredited facility under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and provided water and food (PicoLab® Rodent Diet 20, LabDiet) ad libitum. Diets were supplemented three times per week with Nutri-Cal® (Vétoquinol Canada, Inc., Lavaltrie, QC) and Napa Nectar (S.E. Lab Group, Inc., Napa, CA). All animal research was conducted according to guidelines provided by the National Institute of Health and the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council. The Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal studies. Immature mouse articular chondrocytes (IMACs) were isolated as described by Gosset et al. (25Gosset M. Berenbaum F. Thirion S. Jacques C. Primary culture and phenotyping of murine chondrocytes.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1253-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Briefly, the femoral head and tibial plateaus were dissected from 4-week-old mice. Cartilage pieces were digested twice in 3 mg/ml collagenase for 1 h and then overnight in 0.5 mg/ml collagenase. The resulting suspension of freshly isolated IMACs was placed in micromass culture by plating 10-μl drops containing 2 × 105 cells in DMEM, supplemented with 5% FBS, 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 54 μg/ml β-glycerol phosphate and 1× mixture of insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS) (Invitrogen) as published previously (26Soung do Y.

Culture medium was changed every 3 days for 21 days. IMAC cultures were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min and stained with Alcian blue (1% Alcian blue, 3% acetic acid) for 2 h or 1% Alizarin Red-S (pH 4.2) solution for 10 min. Tibias were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, decalcified in 15% EDTA for 5 days, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained with Alcian blue or Goldner's trichrome solution. Total RNA was isolated from IMAC cultures, ATDC5 cells, and postnatal day 1 (P1) tibias with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and phenol/chloroform. RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using the Superscript cDNA kit (Bio-Rad).

Total protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad DC assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (40 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was accomplished utilizing antibodies (1:2000 dilution) for p-Ser-2448 mTOR, total mTOR, p-Ser-371 p70 S6 kinase, p-Ser-473 Akt, total Akt, p-Thr-202/Tyr-204 Erk, total Erk (Cell Signaling Technologies, Boston, MA), Hdac3, Phlpp1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), Ac-H3 Lys-9/Lys-14, (Millipore, Billercia, MA), HA (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and corresponding secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescent detection was performed with Pierce femto reagent (Pierce). Prior to reprobing, blots were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). Tibias from 2-week-old mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in 15% EDTA for 5 days and paraffin-embedded. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with antibodies directed to Hdac3 (Millipore), Phlpp1 (Abcam), or IgG isotype control. Chromogens were developed using a polyvalent secondary HRP detection kit (Abcam) followed by incubation in 3′-3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma Aldrich). ATDC5 cells were cultured in DMEM, 5% FBS, 1% antimycotic/antibiotic, and 1× ITS. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA-Phlpp1ΔC (Addgene no. 22931 (28Gao T. Furnari F. Newton A.C.

Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of HDAC inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, Vorinostat), or trichostatin A (TSA) for 24 h. ATDC5 cells were cultured for 3 days and then treated with 2 ng/ml TGFβ for 4 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed according to Lambert and Nordeen (30Lambert J.R. Nordeen S.K. Analysis of steroid hormone-induced histone acetylation by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 176: 273-281PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and DNA-protein complexes were cross-linked with 0.03% formaldehyde followed by cell lysis (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Lysates were sonicated, precleared with 30 μg Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and incubated with indicated antibodies (2 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Dynabeads (60 μg) were incubated with each pull down and washed and eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Protein was digested, and the resulting DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform. Amplification of the Phlpp1 promoter at an identified Smad binding site (BS) or a nonspecific binding site was performed with the following primers: (Smad BS, 5′-AGACGGGGCCAGCGATCCTGTGAA-3′ (forward) and Smad BS, 5′-GTCGAGGATACCCAGAAGA-3′ (reverse); nonspecific BS, 5′-CAGAGGGCACAATACCCACC-3′ (forward) and nonspecific BS, 5′-ACTAGTTGAGGCGGGGCGGT-3′ (reverse)). Images were digitally scanned or collected using phase contrast microscopy and converted to threshold values using ImageJ software. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was quantitated by determining the average mean gray value of cells within each growth plate zone. Angles between centers of three columnar chondrocytes within the growth plate of 5-week-old mice were also determined using ImageJ software. Data obtained are the means ± S.E. of the mean (n = 3). p values were determined with the Student's t test. We previously showed that conditional deletion of Hdac3 within Osx1-Cre-expressing, osteo-chondroprogenitor cells stunts long bone growth and reduces trabecular and cortical bone mass (19Razidlo D.F. Whitney T.J. Casper M.E. McGee-Lawrence M.E. Stensgard B.A. Li X. Secreto F.J. Knutson S.K. Hiebert S.W. Westendorf J.J. Histone deacetylase 3 depletion in osteo/chondroprogenitor cells decreases bone density and increases marrow fat.PloS One. 2010; 5: e11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These animals also exhibit an expanded hypertrophic zone (19Razidlo D.F. Whitney T.J. Casper M.E. McGee-Lawrence M.E. Stensgard B.A. Li X. Secreto F.J. Knutson S.K. Hiebert S.W. Westendorf J.J. Histone deacetylase 3 depletion in osteo/chondroprogenitor cells decreases bone density and increases marrow fat.PloS One. 2010; 5: e11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To further understand the role of Hdac3 in chondrocyte differentiation, its expression pattern in the proximal tibia of wild-type (WT) 4-week-old mice was examined by IHC (Fig. 1). Hdac3 was detected in meniscal cells, articular, and epiphyseal chondrocytes surrounding the secondary ossification center (Fig. 1, E and F) and within defined regions of the growth plate (Fig. 1, A and B). Specifically, resting chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes showed robust expression of Hdac3, whereas proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes expressed lower levels. Hdac3 levels were reduced in prehypertrophic chondrocytes, articular chondrocytes, and trabecular bone of Hdac3-CKOOsx mice (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that Hdac3 is spatially and temporally restricted in the developing skeleton and implicate Hdac3 as a crucial regulator of endochondral ossification. To determine whether Hdac3 deficiency alters chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, the distance from the proximal tibia epiphysis to the onset of each respective growth plate zone in postnatal day 1 (P1) WT and Hdac3-CKOOsx mice was measured as described previously (31Karp S.J. Schipani E. St-Jacques B. Hunzelman J. Kronenberg H. McMahon A.P. Indian hedgehog coordinates endochondral bone growth and morphogenesis via parathyroid hormone related-protein-dependent and -independent pathways.Development. 2000; 127: 543-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No overall change in the length of the periarticular chondrocyte zone or in the start of the proliferative zone was observed (Fig. 2A). However, the distance from the epiphyseal surface to the boundary between prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes was shorter in the Hdac3-CKOOsx animals, and the normal columnar array was disorganized (Fig. 2, A and B). Alcian blue staining, which measures glycosaminoglycan content, was also reduced in the Hdac3-CKOOsx P1 tibias (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, transcripts of chondrocyte matrix genes (aggrecan, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), and osteopontin) were significantly decreased in P1 tibias from Hdac3-CKOOsx mice (Fig. 2, C–E). These results indicate that chondrocyte hypertrophy is altered, and matrix secretion is suppressed as a result of Hdac3 deficiency. To validate the in vivo observations and demonstrate that Hdac3 deficiency alters chondrocyte differentiation in a cell autonomous manner, IMACs from Hdac3-CKOOsx or WT mice were cultured ex vivo in micromass for up to 21 days in the presence of ITS medium from days 3 to 21 (Fig. 3). Hdac3 mRNA levels were reduced by ∼50% in IMAC cultures from Hdac3-CKOOsx mice (Fig. 3D). This is the expected level of Hdac3 suppression, because Osx (Sp7) is not expressed in all chondrocytes. Both WT and Hdac3-CKOOsx IMACs formed dense and stable micromasses that bound Alcian blue as early as day 3 (Fig. 3). In response to ITS, WT chondrocytes produced glycosaminoglycans that bound Alcian blue with increasing intensity through day 10. At day 21, hypertrophic chondrocytes dominated the micromasses (Fig. 3C). WT micromasses were encapsulated with a calcified matrix at day 21 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, micromasses from Hdac3-CKOOsx mice stained poorly with Alcian blue beginning at day 7 and relative expression levels of aggrecan, MEPE, and osteopontin mRNAs were decreased in Hdac3-deficient IMACs (Fig. 3, J–L), similar to that observed in vivo (Fig. 2). The diffuse Alcian blue staining persisted throughout the ex vivo differentiation. Matrix calcification was also reduced in the Hdac3-CKOOsx cultures. These data indicate that Hdac3-CKOOsx chondrocytes have defects in chondrocyte matrix production. Further molecular analysis of mRNA expression confirmed that chondrocyte differentiation was disturbed in IMACs from Hdac3-CKOOsx mice (Fig. 3, E–I). Collagen 2a1 and Indian hedgehog, markers of immature and prehypertrophic chondrocytes, as well as VEGF were increased in Hdac3-CKOOsx cultures at day 7 but were down-regulated relative to WT levels by day 14. Runx2 levels increased at equal rates in both WT and Hdac3-CKOOsx cultures. In contrast, collagen X, a late marker of chondrocyte differentiation, increased >50-fold in Hdac3-CKOOsx IMAC cells as compared with 8-fold increases in control cells. The elevated expression of collagen 2a1, Indian hedgehog, and VEGF in Hdac3-CKOOsx mice at early time points suggests accelerated hypertrophy. Whereas rapid down-regulation of collagen 2a1 and Indian hedgehog and reduced levels of matrix genes indicates that Hdac3 is crucial for matrix production and chondrocyte hypertrophy. Reduced VEGF in differentiated chondrocytes may decrease coupling to ossification, thus leading to the expanded hypertrophic zone, more collagen X expression, and decreased bone mass observed in the Hdac3-CKOOsx mice (19Razidlo D.F.

https://openalex.org/W2089062549,"Chemokine receptors are commonly post-translationally sulfated on tyrosine residues in their N-terminal regions, the initial site of binding to chemokine ligands. We have investigated the effect of tyrosine sulfation of the chemokine receptor CCR2 on its interactions with the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2). Inhibition of CCR2 sulfation, by growth of expressing cells in the presence of sodium chlorate, significantly reduced the potency for MCP-1 activation of CCR2. MCP-1 exists in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms. The obligate monomeric mutant MCP-1(P8A) was similar to wild type MCP-1 in its ability to induce leukocyte recruitment in vivo, whereas the obligate dimeric mutant MCP-1(T10C) was less effective at inducing leukocyte recruitment in vivo. In two-dimensional NMR experiments, sulfated peptides derived from the N-terminal region of CCR2 bound to both the monomeric and dimeric forms of wild type MCP-1 and shifted the equilibrium to favor the monomeric form. Similarly, MCP-1(P8A) bound more tightly than MCP-1(T10C) to the CCR2-derived sulfopeptides. NMR chemical shift mapping using the MCP-1 mutants showed that the sulfated N-terminal region of CCR2 binds to the same region (N-loop and β3-strand) of both monomeric and dimeric MCP-1 but that binding to the dimeric form also influences the environment of chemokine N-terminal residues, which are involved in dimer formation. We conclude that interaction with the sulfated N terminus of CCR2 destabilizes the dimerization interface of inactive dimeric MCP-1, thus inducing dissociation to the active monomeric state."

Participants were given a battery of psychological tests to explore levels of internet addiction, mood, anxiety, depression, schizotypy, and autism traits. They were then given exposure to the internet for 15 min, and re-tested for mood and current anxiety. Internet addiction was associated with long-standing depression, impulsive nonconformity, and autism traits. High internet-users also showed a pronounced decrease in mood following internet use compared to the low internet-users. The immediate negative impact of exposure to the internet on the mood of internet addicts may contribute to increased usage by those individuals attempting to reduce their low mood by re-engaging rapidly in internet use."
https://openalex.org/W2066755237,"The demand for vaccination against infectious diseases involves a choice between vaccinating and not vaccinating, in which there is a trade-off between the benefits and costs of each option. The aim of this paper is to investigate these trade-offs and to estimate how the perceived prevalence and severity of both the disease against which the vaccine is given and any vaccine associated adverse events (VAAE) might affect demand. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to elicit stated preferences from a representative sample of 369 UK mothers of children below 5 years of age, for three hypothetical vaccines. Cost was included as an attribute, which enabled estimation of the willingness to pay for different vaccines having differing levels of the probability of occurrence and severity of both the infection and VAAE. The results suggest that the severity of the health effects associated with both the diseases and VAAEs exert an important influence on the demand for vaccination, whereas the probability of these events occurring was not a significant predictor. This has important implications for public health policy, which has tended to focus on the probability of these health effects as the main influence on decision making. Our results also suggest that anticipated regrets about the consequences of making the wrong decision also exert an influence on demand."

Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) regulates multiple cellular pathways and is implicated in various diseases including cancer. Here we investigate a pathological role for GSK3β in the invasive and treatment resistant phenotype of pancreatic cancer.Pancreatic cancer cells were examined for GSK3β expression, phosphorylation and activity using Western blotting and in vitro kinase assay. The effects of GSK3β inhibition on cancer cell survival, proliferation, invasive ability and susceptibility to gemcitabine and radiation were examined following treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor or by RNA interference. Effects of GSK3β inhibition on cancer cell xenografts were also examined.Pancreatic cancer cells showed higher expression and activity of GSK3β than non-neoplastic cells, which were associated with changes in its differential phosphorylation. Inhibition of GSK3β significantly reduced the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, sensitized them to gemcitabine and ionizing radiation, and attenuated their migration and invasion. These effects were associated with decreases in cyclin D1 expression and Rb phosphorylation. Inhibition of GSK3β also altered the subcellular localization of Rac1 and F-actin and the cellular microarchitecture, including lamellipodia. Coincident with these changes were the reduced secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The effects of GSK3β inhibition on tumor invasion, susceptibility to gemcitabine, MMP-2 expression and FAK phosphorylation were observed in tumor xenografts.The targeting of GSK3β represents an effective strategy to overcome the dual challenges of invasiveness and treatment resistance in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2071694400,"Objectives We here investigated whether experimental gingivitis enhances systemic markers of inflammation which are also known as surrogate markers of atherosclerotic plaque development. Background Gingivitis is a low-level oral infection induced by bacterial deposits with a high prevalence within Western populations. A potential link between the more severe oral disease periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has already been shown. Methods 37 non-smoking young volunteers with no inflammatory disease or any cardiovascular risk factors participated in this single-subject interventional study with an intra-individual control. Intentionally experimental oral inflammation was induced by the interruption of oral hygiene for 21 days, followed by a 21-days resolving phase after reinitiation of oral hygiene. Primary outcome measures at baseline, day 21 and 42 were concentrations of hsCRP, IL-6, and MCP-1, as well as adhesion capacity and oxLDL uptake of isolated blood monocytes. Results The partial cessation of oral hygiene procedures was followed by the significant increase of gingival bleeding (34.0%, P<0.0001). This local inflammation was associated with a systemic increase in hsCRP (0.24 mg/L, P = 0.038), IL-6 (12.52 ng/L, P = 0.0002) and MCP-1 (9.10 ng/l, P = 0.124) in peripheral blood samples between baseline and day 21, which decreased at day 42. Monocytes showed an enhanced adherence to endothelial cells and increased foam cell formation after oxLDL uptake (P<0.050) at day 21 of gingivitis. Conclusions Bacterial-induced gingival low-level inflammation induced a systemic increase in inflammatory markers. Dental hygiene almost completely reversed this experimental inflammatory process, suggesting that appropriate dental prophylaxis may also limit systemic markers of inflammation in subjects with natural gingivitis.

Adult beagle dogs (n = 12) were subjected to left proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion by autologous thrombus, followed by two-hour left internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion with 5 French vertebral catheter. One week later, dogs were classified as three groups before transplantation: group A: complete MCA recanalization, group B: incomplete MCA recanalization, group C: no MCA recanalization. 3×10(6) labeled-MSCs were delivered through left ICA. Series in vivo MRI images were obtained before cell grafting, one and 24 hours after transplantation and weekly thereafter until four weeks. MRI findings were compared with histological studies at the time point of 24 hours and four weeks.Home-synthesized SPIO was useful to label MSCs without cell viability compromise. MSCs scattered widely in the left cerebral hemisphere in group A, while fewer grafted cells were observed in group B and no cell was detected in group C at one hour after transplantation. A larger infarction on the day of cell transplantation was associated with more grafted cells in the brain. Grafted MSCs could be tracked effectively by MRI within four weeks and were found in peri-infarction area by Prussian blue staining.It is feasible of IA MSCs transplantation in a canine stroke model. Both the ipsilateral MCA condition and infarction volume before transplantation may affect the amount of grafted cells in target brain. In vivo MR imaging is useful for tracking IA delivered MSCs after SPIO labeling."

Interviews were held with trial team members (n = 30), health workers (n = 15) and parents (n = 51) from two purposively selected hospitals in Soroti, Uganda, and Kilifi, Kenya.Overall, deferred consent with prior assent was seen by staff and parents as having the potential to protect the interests of both patients and researchers, and to avoid delays in starting treatment. An important challenge is that the validity of verbal assent is undermined when inadequate initial information is poorly understood. This concern needs to be balanced against the possibility that full prior consent on admission potentially causes harm through introducing delays. Full prior consent also potentially imposes worries on parents that clinicians are uncertain about how to proceed and that clinicians want to absolve themselves of any responsibility for the child's outcome (some parents' interpretation of the need for signed consent). Voluntariness is clearly compromised for both verbal assent and full prior consent in a context of such vulnerability and stress. Further challenges in obtaining verbal assent were: what to do in the absence of the household decision-maker (often the father); and how medical staff handle parents not giving a clear agreement or refusal.While the challenges identified are faced in all research in low-income settings, they are magnified for emergency trials by the urgency of decision making and treatment needs. Consent options will need to be tailored to particular studies and settings, and might best be informed by consultation with staff members and community representatives using a deliberative approach."
https://openalex.org/W1979512937,"The species from the order Xanthomonadales, which harbors many important plant pathogens and some human pathogens, are currently distinguished primarily on the basis of their branching in the 16S rRNA tree. No molecular or biochemical characteristic is known that is specific for these bacteria. Phylogenetic and comparative analyses were conducted on 26 sequenced Xanthomonadales genomes to delineate their branching order and to identify molecular signatures consisting of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in protein sequences that are specific for these bacteria. In a phylogenetic tree based upon sequences for 28 proteins, Xanthomonadales species formed a strongly supported clade with Rhodanobacter sp. 2APBS1 as its deepest branch. Comparative analyses of protein sequences have identified 13 CSIs in widely distributed proteins such as GlnRS, TypA, MscL, LysRS, LipA, Tgt, LpxA, TolQ, ParE, PolA and TyrB that are unique to all species/strains from this order, but not found in any other bacteria. Fifteen additional CSIs in proteins (viz. CoxD, DnaE, PolA, SucA, AsnB, RecA, PyrG, LigA, MutS and TrmD) are uniquely shared by different Xanthomonadales except Rhodanobacter and in a few cases by Pseudoxanthomonas species, providing further support for the deep branching of these two genera. Five other CSIs are commonly shared by Xanthomonadales and 1-3 species from the orders Chromatiales, Methylococcales and Cardiobacteriales suggesting that these deep branching orders of Gammaproteobacteria might be specifically related. Lastly, 7 CSIs in ValRS, CarB, PyrE, GlyS, RnhB, MinD and X001065 are commonly shared by Xanthomonadales and a limited number of Beta- or Gamma-proteobacteria. Our analysis indicates that these CSIs have likely originated independently and they are not due to lateral gene transfers. The Xanthomonadales-specific CSIs reported here provide novel molecular markers for the identification of these important plant and human pathogens and also as potential targets for development of drugs/agents that specifically target these bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1990458931,"Secreted Protein, Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein involved in many biological processes and found over-expressed in cirrhotic livers. By mean of a genetic approach we herein provide evidence from different in vivo liver disease models suggesting a profibrogenic role for SPARC.Two in vivo models of liver fibrosis, based on TAA administration and bile duct ligation, were developed on SPARC wild-type (SPARC(+/+)) and knock-out (SPARC(-/-)) mice. Hepatic SPARC expression was analyzed by qPCR. Fibrosis was assessed by Sirius Red staining, and the maturation state of collagen fibers was analyzed using polarized light. Necroinflammatory activity was evaluated by applying the Knodell score and liver inflammatory infiltration was characterized by immunohistochemistry. Hepatic stellate cell activation was assessed by α-SMA immunohistochemistry. In addition, pro-fibrogenic genes and inflammatory cytokines were measured by qPCR and/or ELISA. Liver gene expression profile was analyzed in SPARC(-/-) and SPARC(+/+) mice using Affymetrix Mouse Gene ST 1.0 array.SPARC expression was found induced in fibrotic livers of mouse and human. SPARC(-/-) mice showed a reduction in the degree of inflammation, mainly CD4+ cells, and fibrosis. Consistently, collagen deposits and mRNA expression levels were decreased in SPARC(-/-) mice when compared to SPARC(+/+) mice; in addition, MMP-2 expression was increased in SPARC(-/-) mice. A reduction in the number of activated myofibroblasts was observed. Moreover, TGF-β1 expression levels were down-regulated in the liver as well as in the serum of TAA-treated knock-out animals. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis suggested several gene networks which might involve protective mechanisms of SPARC deficiency against liver fibrogenesis and a better established machinery to repair DNA and detoxify from external chemical stimuli.Overall our data suggest that SPARC plays a significant role in liver fibrogenesis. Interventions to inhibit SPARC expression are suggested as promising approaches for liver fibrosis treatment."

Individual deletion of cyaA or crp, which respectively encode adenylate cyclase and cAMP receptor protein in K. pneumoniae, markedly increased CPS production, while deletion of cpdA, which encodes cAMP phosphodiesterase, decreased CPS production. These results indicate that K. pneumoniae CPS biosynthesis is controlled by the cAMP-dependent carbon catabolite repression (CCR). To investigate the underlying mechanism, quantitative real-time PCR and promoter-reporter assays were used to verify that the transcription of CPS biosynthesis genes, which are organized into 3 transcription units (orf1-2, orf3-15, and orf16-17), were activated by the deletion of crp. Sequence analysis revealed putative CRP binding sites located on Porf3-15 and Porf16-17, suggesting direct CRP-cAMP regulation on the promoters. These results were then confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, we found putative CRP binding sites located in the promoter region of rcsA, which encodes a cps transcriptional activator, demonstrating a direct repression of CRP-cAMP and PrcsA. The deletion of rcsA in mutation of crp partially reduced CPS biosynthesis and the transcription of orf1-2 but not of orf3-15 or orf16-17. These results suggest that RcsA participates in the CRP-cAMP regulation of orf1-2 transcription and influences CPS biosynthesis. Finally, the effect of glucose and CCR proteins on CPS biosynthesis also reflects bacterial resistance to serum killing. We here provide evidence that K. pneumoniae increases CPS biosynthesis for successful infection in response to exogenous glucose via cAMP-dependent CCR."

However, examining murine lung lymphatics is hampered by the expression of classical lymph endothelial markers on other cell types, which hinders the unambiguous identification of lymphatics. The expression of CD90/Thy-1 on lymph endothelium was recently described and we therefore examined its suitability to identify murine pulmonary lymph vessels under healthy and inflammatory conditions.Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against CD90.2/Thy-1.2 on 200 µm thick precision cut lung slices labeled a vascular network that was distinct from blood vessels. Preembedding immunostaining and electron microscopy verified that the anti-CD90.2/Thy-1.2 antibody labeled lymphatic endothelium. Absence of staining in CD90.1/Thy-1.1 expressing FVB mice indicated that CD90/Thy-1 was expressed on lymph endothelium and labeling was not due to antibody cross reactivity. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry for CD90/Thy-1 and α-smooth muscle actin identified two routes for lymph vessel exit from the murine lung. One started in the parenchyma or around veins and left via venous blood vessels. The other began in the space around airways or in the space between airways and pulmonary arteries and left via the main bronchi. As expected from the pulmonary distribution of lymph vessels, intranasal application of house dust mite led to accumulation of T cells around veins and in the connective tissue between airways and pulmonary arteries. Surprisingly, increased numbers of T cells were also detected around intraacinar arteries that lack lymph vessels. This arterial T cell sheath extended to the pulmonary arteries where lymph vessels were located.These results indicate that CD90/Thy-1 is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells and represents a suitable marker for murine lung lymph vessels. Combining CD90/Thy-1 labeling with precision cut lung slices allows visualizing the anatomy of the lymphatic system in normal and inflamed conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2094993195,"Ligation of polyubiquitin chains to proteins is a fundamental post-translational modification, often resulting in targeted degradation of conjugated proteins. Attachment of polyubiquitin chains requires the activities of an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 carrier protein, and an E3 ligase. The mechanism by which polyubiquitin chains are formed remains largely speculative, especially for RING-based ligases. The tripartite motif (TRIM) superfamily of ligases functions in many cellular processes including innate immunity, cellular localization, development and differentiation, signaling, and cancer progression. The present results show that TRIM ligases catalyze polyubiquitin chain formation in the absence of substrate, the rates of which can be used as a functional readout of enzyme function. Initial rate studies under biochemically defined conditions show that TRIM32 and TRIM25 are specific for the Ubc5 family of E2-conjugating proteins and, along with TRIM5α, exhibit cooperative kinetics with respect to Ubc5 concentration, with submicromolar [S]0.5 and Hill coefficients of 3-5, suggesting they possess multiple binding sites for their cognate E2-ubiquitin thioester. Mutation studies reveal a second, non-canonical binding site encompassing the C-terminal Ubc5α-helix. Polyubiquitin chain formation requires TRIM subunit oligomerization through the conserved coiled-coil domain, but can be partially replaced by fusing the catalytic domain to GST to promote dimerization. Other results suggest that TRIM32 assembles polyubiquitin chains as a Ubc5-linked thioester intermediate. These results represent the first detailed mechanistic study of TRIM ligase activity and provide a functional context for oligomerization observed in the superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2061421971,"Plant ALDH10 family members are aminoaldehyde dehydrogenases (AMADHs), which oxidize ω-aminoaldehydes to the corresponding acids. They have been linked to polyamine catabolism, osmoprotection, secondary metabolism (fragrance), and carnitine biosynthesis. Plants commonly contain two AMADH isoenzymes. We previously studied the substrate specificity of two AMADH isoforms from peas (PsAMADHs). Here, two isoenzymes from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), SlAMADHs, and three AMADHs from maize (Zea mays), ZmAMADHs, were kinetically investigated to obtain further clues to the catalytic mechanism and the substrate specificity. We also solved the high resolution crystal structures of SlAMADH1 and ZmAMADH1a because these enzymes stand out from the others regarding their activity. From the structural and kinetic analysis, we can state that five residues at positions 163, 288, 289, 444, and 454 (PsAMADHs numbering) can, directly or not, significantly modulate AMADH substrate specificity. In the SlAMADH1 structure, a PEG aldehyde derived from the precipitant forms a thiohemiacetal intermediate, never observed so far. Its absence in the SlAMADH1-E260A structure suggests that Glu-260 can activate the catalytic cysteine as a nucleophile. We show that the five AMADHs studied here are capable of oxidizing 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionaldehyde to the cryo- and osmoprotectant 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionate. For the first time, we also show that 3-acetamidopropionaldehyde, the third aminoaldehyde besides 3-aminopropionaldehyde and 4-aminobutyraldehyde, is generally oxidized by AMADHs, meaning that these enzymes are unique in metabolizing and detoxifying aldehyde products of polyamine degradation to nontoxic amino acids.

In plants, polyamines like spermine, spermidine, and putrescine are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses (1Bouchereau A. Aziz A. Larher F. Martin-Tanguy J. Polyamines and environmental challenges. Recent development.Plant Sci. 1999; 140: 103-125Crossref Scopus (1043) Google Scholar).

Studying the physiological aspects of plant AMADHs (EC 1.2.1.19) has become attractive for economic reasons. It has been shown that an AMADH gene mutation leads to the acetylation of free ABAL (or its cyclic form Δ1-pyrroline) and accumulation of 2-acetyl-Δ1-pyrroline, a potent flavor component conferring a fragrance to several rice varieties like jasmine and basmati or to soybean (6Bradbury L.M.

Plant AMADHs have also been studied for their role in stress responses and in the production of the osmoprotectants glycine betaine (GB) and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) by the oxidation of betaine aldehyde (BAL) and 3-dimethylsulfoniopropionaldehyde (DMSPAL), respectively (8Rhodes D.

AMADHs are classified in different aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) families because of the established criteria stating that ALDH sequences have to be 40% identical to create a family. Because plant AMADHs display between 35 and 39% sequence identity with bacterial, fungal, fish, or mammalian AMADHs, they have recently been classified in the separate family ALDH10 (11Kirch H.H. Bartels D. Wei Y. Schnable P.S. Wood A.J. The ALDH gene superfamily of Arabidopsis.Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Several enzymes of the ALDH9 family covering mammalian AMADHs (12Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Aldehyde dehydrogenase gene superfamily. The 2002 update.Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and of the ALDH10 family from various species have been independently shown to oxidize a wide range of aminoaldehydes and other aldehydes (Fig. 1). Therefore, they have been also called 4-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.19), 4-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.54), betaine aldehyde dehydrogenases (BADHs; EC 1.2.1.8), and 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenases (EC 1.2.1.47). Plant AMADHs share around 70–80% sequence identity. One complete AMADH sequence is usually known for many plant species. However, ongoing genome analyses have gradually shown the presence of two genes coding for two homologous proteins of at least 80% sequence identity. Interestingly, most plant AMADHs carry the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal S(A)KL and are found in peroxisomes (13Nakamura T. Yokota S. Muramoto Y. Tsutsui K. Oguri Y. Fukui K. Takabe T.

We have previously identified two pea AMADHs (Pisum sativum; PsAMADH1 and PsAMADH2) and analyzed their crystal structures (4Tylichová M. Kopečný D. Moréra S. Briozzo P. Lenobel R. Snégaroff J.

Biol. 2010; 396: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Plant AMADHs are dimeric and possess a 14-Å-long substrate channel in each monomer. There are three strictly conserved residues essential for the catalysis, Asn-162, Cys-294, and Glu-260, which lie in PWNYP, GQI(V)CSATSR, and ELGGKSP consensus motifs. The three catalytic residues (Asn, Cys, and Glu) lie at the substrate channel bottom and together form the active site. The catalytic mechanism follows the well described sequential binding model valid for the ALDH superfamily (15Perez-Miller S.J. Hurley T.D. Coenzyme isomerization is integral to catalysis in aldehyde dehydrogenase.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7100-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 16Wymore T. Hempel J. Cho S.S.

Aminoaldehyde substrates undergo a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine, leading to a thioester formation (i.e. a covalent intermediate) and the subsequent hydride transfer to NAD+. The conserved glutamate residue functions as a general base activating a water molecule. Such a molecule performs a nucleophilic attack at the thioester acyl-sulfur bond, resulting in the release of the amino acid. Using site-directed mutagenesis performed on PsAMADH2 (17Kopečný D.

We also noticed that the activity on several aminoaldehyde substrates is affected by Trp-288. In order to predict the substrate specificity differences in AMADH pairs from a single species and between species and because only a few plant AMADH pairs were reported and studied (4Tylichová M.

The dimeric structures were determined at 1.90 and 1.95 Å resolution, respectively. Although both soaking and co-crystallization with substrates were attempted and despite using the active-site base mutant SlAMADH1-E260A for this purpose, obtaining AMADH in such a complex was unsuccessful. However, ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) aldehyde molecules from the crystallization solution were found to mimic a substrate bound at the substrate binding site in ZmAMADH1a and SlAMADH1 structures, respectively. Moreover, we obtained the first crystal structure of a thiohemiacetal intermediate in AMADH family; a PEG aldehyde bound covalently to the catalytic cysteine forms an intermediate in one subunit of the SlAMADH1 structure in which only ADP moiety of NAD+ is ordered. The whole NAD+ is ordered in ZmAMADH1a and SlAMADH1-E260A structures and adopts the common conformation observed in ALDH structures. Combining structural analysis and kinetics, we can state that five residues at positions 163, 288, 289, 444, and 454 (PsAMADH numbering) can significantly modulate AMADH substrate specificity. Trp-288 and Tyr-163 are essential for the high affinity to ω-aminoaldehyde substrates. The absence of this Trp in addition to the presence of a Thr (instead of Cys in other enzymes) in SlAMADH1 leads to a broader substrate specificity due to an enlargement of its substrate channel. We can predict that AMADHs containing Ile-444 have only a negligible activity with BAL. Conversely, those containing an Asn at position 289 may display BAL activity. For the first time, we identify a new and common substrate for plant AMADHs. The total RNA from apical meristems and leaves of 7-day-old tomato seedlings (S. lycopersicum cv. Amateur) and 5-day-old maize seedlings (Z. mays cv. Sachara) was extracted using the Midi spin column kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and the cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). SlAMADH1 and -2 and ZmAMADH1a, -1b, and -2 cDNA sequences were originally obtained in this work and submitted to the EMBL/GenBankTM database. The SlAMADH1 ORF (1515 bp; EMBL/GenBankTM accession number AY796114) was amplified using a primer pair with a BamHI (5′-CAGGGATCCGGCAAATCGTAATGTACCA-3′) and XhoI site (5′-CGTCTCGAGCTAATTCTTTGAAGGTGACTTAT-3′). For the SlAMADH2 ORF (1518 bp; FJ228482), an upstream primer with the EcoRI site (5′-CATGAATTCGGCGATTCCTAATATACGGAT-3′) and a downstream primer with the KpnI site (5′-AGTGGTACCTTACAGCTTTGAAGGAGACT-3′) were used. All three maize genes were cloned with primer pairs containing EcoRI and XhoI sites. ZmAMADH1a ORF (1518 bp; GQ184593) was amplified using the following primers: 5′-ATTGAATTCTGCCTCGCCAGCGATGGTCCCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCGAGTTCGTCTTGCCAGTTTACAGC-3′. ZmAMADH1b ORF (1518 bp; JN635700) was amplified using the primer pair 5′-ATTGAATTCTGCCTCGCAAGCGATGGTACCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCGAGTTCGTCTTGCCAGTTTACAGC-3′, and ZmAMADH2 ORF (1521 bp; GQ184594) was cloned using the primer pair 5′-ATAGAATTCAGCGCCGCCGCAGACGAT-3′ and 5′-ATACTCGAGTCACAGCTTAGATGGAGGCTGGT-3′. The amplified sequences were inserted into a pCDFDuet vector (Novagen, La Jolla, CA), sequenced, and transformed into T7 express Escherichia coli cells for expression as N-terminal His6 tag proteins. Enzymes were produced and purified on a column filled with Co(II)-charged IDA-Sepharose 6B (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (20Tylichová M. Briozzo P. Kopečný D. Ferrero J. Moréra S. Joly N.

Specific activity values measured with 1 mm APAL as a substrate were 3.1 units mg−1 for SlAMADH1, 3.6 units mg−1 for SlAMADH2, 2.6 units mg−1 for ZmAMADH1a, 1.9 units mg−1 for ZmAMADH1b, 4.1 units mg−1 for ZmAMADH2. For crystallization, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 pLysS (Novagen). The cells were grown in 2YT medium at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.6, the temperature was reduced to 20 °C, and expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The cells were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 20 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane (Millipore) and loaded on a 5-ml nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose column (GE Healthcare). After washing with 10% buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl), elution was performed with 100% buffer B. Fractions containing AMADH were pooled, and the buffer exchange was performed on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare), using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing AMADH were pooled, concentrated using Vivaspin-10kDa (Sartorius) at 14 mg/ml, and stored at −20 °C. The identity of the purified proteins was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting on a Microflex LRF20 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) after SDS-PAGE and in-gel digestion (21Šebela M.

NAD+ and NAD analogs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of NADH (ϵ340 = 6.62 mm−1 cm−1) at 37 °C. The reaction mixture in a cuvette contained 0.15 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, 1 mm NAD+, and appropriate amounts of AMADH. The enzyme reaction was started by the addition of APAL (or another aminoaldehyde) at a final 1 mm concentration. NAD+ analogs were assayed at 0.5 mm concentration with 1 mm APAL as described previously (4Tylichová M. Kopečný D. Moréra S. Briozzo P. Lenobel R. Snégaroff J. Šebela M.

Tris-HCl buffers (150 mm) in the pH range from 7.0 to 9.0 and 150 mm glycine-NaOH buffers in the pH range from 8.8 to 10.6 were used to determine pH optima using 1 mm APAL and 0.5 mm NAD+. Kinetic constants were determined with GraphPad Prism 5.0 data analysis software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). In those cases where no substrate inhibition was observed, the data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The data were analyzed by a nonlinear regression using the Michaelis-Menten equation that includes terms in the numerator and denominator to account for partial substrate inhibition (25Holt A.

Crystallization conditions using commercial kits (Classics, PEGs II, and JCSG I suites from Qiagen) were screened in sitting-drop vapor diffusion experiments using a Cartesian nanodrop robot (Genomic Solutions) on IMAGIF (CNRS, Gif sur Yvette, France). SlAMADH1 with 5 mm NAD+ was crystallized over reservoirs containing 23% PEG 1000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5.

https://openalex.org/W1968804605,"Introduction Ca2+ spark constitutes the elementary units of cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in mature cardiomyocytes. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes are known to have electrophysiological properties similar to mature adult cardiomyocytes. However, it is unclear if they share similar calcium handling property. We hypothesized that Ca2+ sparks in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) may display unique structural and functional properties than mature adult cardiomyocytes. Methods and results Ca2+ sparks in hiPSC-CMs were recorded with Ca2+ imaging assay with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Those sparks were stochastic with a tendency of repetitive occurrence at the same site. Nevertheless, the spatial-temporal properties of Ca2+ spark were analogous to that of adult CMs. Inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine caused a 61% reduction in calcium spark frequency without affecting amplitude of those sparks and magnitude of caffeine releasable sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ content. In contrast, high extracellular Ca2+ and ryanodine increased the frequency, full width at half maximum (FWHM) and full duration at half maximum (FDHM) of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks. Conclusions For the first time, spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were detected in hiPSC-CMs. The Ca2+ sparks are predominately triggered by L-type Ca2+ channels mediated Ca2+ influx, which is comparable to sparks detected in adult ventricular myocytes in which cardiac E-C coupling was governed by a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. However, focal repetitive sparks originated from the same intracellular organelle could reflect an immature status of the hiPSC-CMs."
https://openalex.org/W2023965980,"Metadherin (MTDH), the newly discovered gene, is overexpressed in more than 40% of breast cancers. Recent studies have revealed that MTDH favors an oncogenic course and chemoresistance. With a number of breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor samples, we found that the relative expression of MTDH correlated with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) sensitivity in breast cancer. In this study, we found that knockdown of endogenous MTDH cells sensitized the MDA-MB-231 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, stable overexpression of MTDH in MCF-7 cells enhanced cell survival with TRAIL treatment. Mechanically, MTDH down-regulated caspase-8, decreased caspase-8 recruitment into the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex, decreased caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 processing, increased Bcl-2 expression, and stimulated TRAIL-induced Akt phosphorylation, without altering death receptor status. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, sensitization to TRAIL upon MTDH down-regulation was inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone), suggesting that MTDH depletion stimulates activation of caspases. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, resistance to TRAIL upon MTDH overexpression was abrogated by depletion of Bcl-2, suggesting that MTDH-induced Bcl-2 expression contributes to TRAIL resistance. We further confirmed that MTDH may control Bcl-2 expression partly by suppressing miR-16. Collectively, our results point to a protective function of MTDH against TRAIL-induced death, whereby it inhibits the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through miR-16-mediated Bcl-2 up-regulation and the extrinsic apoptosis pathway through caspase-8 down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2050315656,"Lafora disease (LD) is a teenage-onset inherited progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by the accumulations of intracellular inclusions called Lafora bodies and caused by mutations in protein phosphatase laforin or ubiquitin ligase malin. But how the loss of function of either laforin or malin causes disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recently, neuronatin was identified as a novel substrate of malin that regulates glycogen synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the level of neuronatin is significantly up-regulated in the skin biopsy sample of LD patients having mutations in both malin and laforin. Neuronatin is highly expressed in human fetal brain with gradual decrease in expression in developing and adult brain. However, in adult brain, neuronatin is predominantly expressed in parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and localized in their processes. The level of neuronatin is increased and accumulated as insoluble aggregates in the cortical area of LD brain biopsy samples, and there is also a dramatic loss of parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons. Ectopic expression of neuronatin in cultured neuronal cells results in increased intracellular Ca(2+), endoplasmic reticulum stress, proteasomal dysfunction, and cell death that can be partially rescued by malin. These findings suggest that the neuronatin-induced aberrant Ca(2+) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress might underlie LD pathogenesis."

Using KCNQ mutant mouse models we now resolve the controversy surrounding the contribution of KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 to vestibular HC currents and determine their physiological relevance for the vestibular system. We found that neither channel is significantly expressed in adult vestibular HCs, but rather postsynaptically in calyx terminals where their expression partially overlaps. Accordingly, currents of vestibular HCs were unchanged upon gene disruption. Vestibulo-ocular reflexes were reduced both in Kcnq4−/− and Kcnq4−/−/Kcnq5dn/dn double mutant mice, whereas only marginal effects were observed in Kcnq5dn/dn mice. The larger impact of Kcnq4 disruption on vestibular function may be related to its preferential expression in the central zones of vestibular sensory epithelia. The generation of Kcnq4−/−, Kcnq4dn/dn, and Kcnq5dn/dn mice and their genotyping has been described previously (5Kharkovets T. Dedek K. Maier H. Schweizer M. Khimich D. Nouvian R. Vardanyan V.

Double mutant mice were generated by crossing Kcnq4−/− and Kcnq5dn/dn mice. They were viable, fertile, and had no immediately apparent phenotype. They were kept and investigated in the mixed background. Subsequently, all mutant genotypes were obtained by breeding mice heterozygous for both genes. Mice of either sex were used for experiments.

Inner ears were dissected from the temporal bones in PBS and processed for (i) whole mount, (ii) slice immunohistochemistry, or (iii) in situ hybridization.

Tissues were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated in blocking solution (17Lysakowski A. Alonto A. Jacobson L.

Primary antibodies were incubated for 48 h in carrier solution (PBS containing 1.5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.25% Nonidet P-40). Secondary antibodies diluted in carrier solution were incubated overnight. Tissues were mounted unflattened in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).

Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes and used diluted 1:500 for (i) and 1:1000 for (ii). For in situ hybridization (iii), sense and antisense digoxigenin-UTP-labeled riboprobes (DIG RNA labeling Mix; Roche Applied Science) were generated with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), respectively, from linearized mouse cDNA clones (bp 1114–1560 for Kcnq4 and 1744–2352 for Kcnq5). In situ hybridization on inner ear cryosections was performed as described (19Braissant O. Wahli W. Differential expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, -β, and -γ during rat embryonic development.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Pictures were taken for (ii) by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510; Zeiss), analyzed off-line with ZEN 2009 light edition software (Zeiss), and assembled using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems). Pictures for (iii) were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot or Zeiss Stemi-2000-c microscope. Whole cell recordings were done on HCs from acutely dissected utricles that were perfused at 0.5 ml/min with oxygenated solution containing 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The epithelium was cut transversally and anchored to the chamber floor with two pieces of glass, exposing the basolateral membrane of hair cells. Central and peripheral hair cells could not be easily distinguished in this semi-intact preparation. However, patches were mostly obtained in the central and adjacent areas of the exposed tissue which may span the whole striola and juxtastriola and a minor portion of extrastriola. Recordings were done with 3–4-megohm electrodes filled with 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgATP, 1 mm NaGTP, pH 7.3. Type I and type II HCs were characterized (20Gaboyard S. Chabbert C. Travo C. Bancel F. Lehouelleur J. Yamauchi D. Marcus D.C. Sans A. Three-dimensional culture of newborn rat utricle using an extracellular matrix promotes formation of a cyst.Neuroscience. 2005; 133: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) by the presence or absence, respectively, of the gK,L conductance (1Rüsch A. Lysakowski A. Eatock R.A. Postnatal development of type I and type II hair cells in the mouse utricle: acquisition of voltage-gated conductances and differentiated morphology.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7487-7501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopic inspection further helped to identify HC classes. Whole cell recordings were done using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). After seal formation (>10 GΩ) onto the basolateral membrane of HCs and membrane disruption, we estimated membrane capacitance (Cm) and series resistance (Rs) from the decay of capacitive transients induced by a ±10-mV pulse from a holding potential of −80 mV. After cancellation of capacitive transients, Rs was compensated up to 85%. The resting potential was measured as the zero current voltage in the current clamp mode. Data analysis used pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices) and Origin 7.5 (OriginLab). Data were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. The voltage clamp protocol started from a holding potential of −70 (for type II HCs) or −90 mV (for type I HCs), followed by a 50-ms pulse to −110 mV for type I HCs and −100 mV for type II HCs followed by test pulses of 200 ms between −110 and +40 mV for type I HC and −100 to +50 mV in type II HC in steps of 10 mV, and a constant step to −30 mV for tail currents. In statistical analysis, the number of cells is given by n, and number of animals by N. Xenopus oocytes were obtained and injected as described (15Schroeder B.C. Hechenberger M. Weinreich F. Kubisch C. Jentsch T.J. KCNQ5, a novel potassium channel broadly expressed in brain, mediates M-type currents.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24089-24095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A final amount of 20 ng of cRNA/oocyte was injected for each condition. Oocytes were incubated 3–4 days at 17 °C and then examined by two-electrode voltage clamping using a Turbo Tec03 (NPI Electronics) amplifier and pClamp 8.0 software (Molecular Devices). The protocol consisted of 5-s steps from −110 to +50 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was tested in four groups of adult mice including wild-type (WT, n = 15), Kcnq4−/− (n = 13), Kcnq5dn/dn (n = 17), and Kcnq4−/−/Kcnq5dn/dn (n = 13). In each experimental group about half of the mice were male. Mice were prepared for chronic head-restrained experiments, as described (21Wulff P. Schonewille M. Renzi M. Viltono L. Sassoè-Pognetto M. Badura A. Gao Z. Hoebeek F.E. van Dorp S. Wisden W. Farrant M. De Zeeuw C.I. Synaptic inhibition of Purkinje cells mediates consolidation of vestibulo-cerebellar motor learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee (DEC) of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (KNAW). During the experiment the mouse was placed head-fixed in a holder tube on a vestibular motion platform (R2000 Rotopod; Parallel Robotic Systems Corporation). Left eye orientation was measured using video pupil tracking with a table fixed CCD camera (Pulnix TM-6710CL, 120 frames/s) and IR illumination (850-nm LED, 6.5-cm distance from the eye). Pilocarpine (2%) eye drops were applied before the experiment to limit pupil dilatation in darkness. Online image analysis was performed to extract the location of pupil edges and corneal light reflections using custom built software for Labview (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Angular eye velocity was computed offline using custom software written for Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) using the algorithm outlined elsewhere (22Stahl J.S. van Alphen A.M. De Zeeuw C.I.

Calcium channelopathy mutants and their role in ocular motor research.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 956: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Saccadic eye movements and nystagmus fast phases were removed using a 50°/s velocity threshold and 200-ms margins at each threshold crossing. Each mouse was accustomed to the setup and experimental paradigm in a period of up to 3 training days before the experimental data were collected. The horizontal VOR was characterized in darkness and in the light using sinusoidal rotation about the yaw axis, using frequencies ranging between 1/16 and 4 Hz, presented in a sequence of increasing order. Peak velocity was held constant at 25°/s. The number of cycles ranged between 5 (at 1/16 Hz) and 60 at 4 Hz. Eye velocity amplitude and phase shift relative to head movement were calculated using multiple linear regression of eye velocity to in-phase and quadrature components of the stimulus velocity. Gain of the eye movement response was defined as the ratio between the eye velocity amplitude and the stimulus velocity amplitude. Phase shift is expressed in degrees; positive phase shifts indicate phase lead. Error bars represent the S.E. Circular statistics were used to compare phase values. Transfer function profiles were statistically compared using MANOVA for repeated measures (SPSS Statistics 17.0.).

We now used three genetic mouse models to control immunohistochemical labeling and to explore potential cross-talk between the expression of both proteins. Kcnq4−/− mice lack the KCNQ4 protein, whereas Kcnq4dn/dn mice express a dominant negative KCNQ4 variant carrying a point mutation (G286S) in the pore-forming P-loop (5Kharkovets T. Dedek K. Maier H.

Labeling vestibular end organs with our antibodies revealed a differential distribution of KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 in both the otholithic organs (Fig. 1) and cristae (supplemental Fig. S1). As displayed for utricles in Fig. 1A, KCNQ4 was most highly expressed in the central striolar and the adjacent juxtastriolar regions. It extended at weaker expression levels to the adjacent extrastriola (Fig. 1, A and J). By contrast, KCNQ5 was found mainly in the extrastriola and extended at lower expression levels into the juxtastriola (Fig. 1, B and K). As described previously (4Kharkovets T. Hardelin J.P.

Calyces were co-labeled for KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 in the juxtastriolar and extrastriolar regions (Fig. 1L). Likewise, KCNQ4 was found in central, intermediate, and peripheral zones of the cristae ampullares, whereas KCNQ5 was expressed in intermediate and peripheral zones but was almost undetectable in central zones (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C, J–L). Importantly, labeling for KCNQ4 was abolished in tissue from Kcnq4−/− mice (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S1D), validating the specificity of our staining. Surprisingly, labeling for KCNQ5 was virtually abolished in utricles from Kcnq5dn/dn mice that express a full-length KCNQ5 protein carrying a single point mutation (Fig. 1H). A similar pattern was observed in cristae ampullares (supplemental Fig. S1, H and N). Besides validating our KCNQ5 antibody staining, this finding suggested that the mutant protein was unstable or incorrectly targeted.

To study the metabolic profiles and pathways activated in osteoporosis, Eight rats were oophorectomized (OVX group) to represent postmenopausal osteoporosis and the other eight rats were sham operated (Sham group) to be the control. The biochemical changes were assessed with metabolomics using a gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Metabolomic profile using serial blood samples obtained prior to and at different time intervals after OVX were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The conventional indicators (bone mineral density, serum Bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) of osteoporosis in rats were also determined simultaneously. In OVX group, the metabolomics method could describe the endogenous changes of the disease more sensitively and systematically than the conventional criteria during the progression of osteoporosis. Significant metabolomic difference was also observed between the OVX and Sham groups. The metabolomic analyses of rat plasma showed that levels of arachidonic acid, octadecadienoic acid, branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), homocysteine, hydroxyproline and ketone bodies (3-Hydroxybutyric Acid) significantly elevated, while levels of docosahexaenoic acid, dodecanoic acid and lysine significantly decreased in OVX group compared with those in the homeochronous Sham group. Considering such metabolites are closely related to the pathology of the postmenopausal osteoporosis, the results suggest that potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis or the pathogenesis of osteoporosis might be identified via metabolomic study."

Maximal bilateral isometric strength (MVC), isometric rate of force development (RFD) and serum concentrations of testosterone (T), cortisol (C), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured during and after both loadings.Both of the present combined (ES and SE) loadings led to a greater acute decrease in MVC in men than in women, while RFD was slightly affected only in men. Recovery of MVC and RFD to baseline was complete at 24 h regardless of the order of exercises. In men, neuromuscular fatigue was accompanied by increased C concentrations observed post SE. This was followed by decreased concentrations of T at 24 h and 48 h that were significantly lower than those observed following ES. GH response in men also differed significantly post loadings. In women, only a significant difference in T between ES and SE loadings was observed at post.These observed differences in hormonal responses despite similarities in neuromuscular fatigue in men indicate the presence of an order effect as the body was not fully recovered at 48 h following SE. These findings may be applicable in training prescription in order to optimize specific training adaptations."
https://openalex.org/W2160027458,"Galactofuranose (Galf) is the five-membered ring form of galactose. Although it is absent from mammalian glycans, it occurs as a structural and antigenic component of important cell surface molecules in a variety of microbes, ranging from bacteria to parasites and fungi. One such organism is Cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogenic yeast that causes lethal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals, particularly AIDS patients. C. neoformans is unique among fungal pathogens in bearing a complex polysaccharide capsule, a critical virulence factor reported to include Galf. Notably, how Galf modification contributes to the structure and function of the cryptococcal capsule is not known. We have determined that Galf is β1,2-linked to an unusual tetrasubstituted galactopyranose of the glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal) capsule polysaccharide. This discovery fills a longstanding gap in our understanding of a major polymer of the cryptococcal capsule. We also engineered a C. neoformans strain that lacks UDP-galactopyranose mutase; this enzyme forms UDP-Galf, the nucleotide sugar donor required for Galf addition. Mutase activity was required for the incorporation of Galf into glucuronoxylomannogalactan but was dispensable for vegetative growth, cell integrity, and virulence in a mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2135532026,"Since accumulating evidence suggests the application of anesthetics may increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we investigated the cytotoxicity of inhaled general anesthesia in neurons and its underlying mechanism. Using primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons as the study model, here we show that isoflurane increases vulnerability to intracellular or extracellular amyloid β with or without serum deprivation. This isoflurane-induced effect is mediated by the downregulation of miR-214 level that lead to an elevated expression of Bax, a prominent target for miR-214. We conclude that isoflurane increases cell death in the presence of amyloid β by increasing Bax level through downregulating miR-214. Our data provide a new insight for inhaled anesthetics toxicity and indicate a possible mechanistic link between anesthetic application and neurodegenration in AD."

Additionally, the association of folate with breast cancer estrogen receptor (ER) status is not well established. Objective To determine if dietary intakes of folate, B-vitamins (B2, B6, B12) and methionine are associated with breast cancer risk and ER status in Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women in the southwestern US. Materials and Methods Primary breast cancer cases (n = 2,325) in the 4-Corners region (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah), diagnosed between October 1999 and May 2004, were identified through state cancer registries. Controls (n = 2,525) were frequency-matched by ethnicity and age (±5 years). Dietary intake, physical activity and other exposures were assessed using in-person interviews. Risk was assessed through multivariable and multinomial logistic regression with adjustment for relevant covariates. Result While there was no overall association with breast cancer, the highest quartile of folate intake was marginally inversely associated with ER− breast cancer (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.50, 95%CI 0.25–1.00, p for trend = 0.07). Vitamin B12 intake was inversely associated with breast cancer also (OR = 0.73, 95%CI 0.53–1.00, p for trend = 0.06), particularly for the highest quartile of ER+ breast cancer (OR = 0.67, 95%CI 0.46–0.99, p for trend = 0.06), among NHW women (OR = 0.49, 95%CI 0.29–0.81, p for trend = 0.01) and invasive breast cancer (OR = 0.63; 95%CI: 0.42, 0.93, Ptrend = 0.01). Methionine intake was also inversely associated with ER+ breast cancer (OR for 4th quartile = 0.83, 95%CI 0.66–1.03, p for trend = 0.04), primarily among Hispanic women (OR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.47–1.06, and P for trend = 0.02). Conclusion Higher intake of folate is marginally associated with a lower risk for ER− breast cancer, and higher intakes of vitamin B-12 and methionine are marginally associated with a lower risk of ER+ breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1984866950,"Infection of influenza A virus in mammals induces hyper lung pneumonia, which often causes lethal diseases. FasL is a specific ligand of Fas, which is a type-I transmembrane protein to induce cell death. Previously, it has been reported that the hyper induction of gene expression associated with Fas signal is observed in lethal influenza A virus infection. More importantly, it was also reported that functional mutation of the FasL gene protects the host against influenza A virus infection. These observations suggest that induction of FasL signal is functionally associated with the severity of influenza. However, regulation of the induction of FasL or Fas by influenza A virus infection is still unknown. Here, we demonstrated that FasL is induced after the viral infection, and inhibition of the Fas/FasL signal by treatment with a recombinant decoy receptor for FasL (Fas-Fc) increases the survival rate of mice after lethal infection of influenza A virus as well as functional mutation of the FasL gene in gld/gld mice. In addition, the induction level of FasL gene expression in the lung was correlated with the severity of influenza. We also showed that a variety of types of cells in the lung express FasL after the viral infection. Furthermore, type-I interferon induced by the viral infection was shown to be critical for induction of FasL protein expression in the lung. These findings suggested that expression of FasL protein induced by type-I IFN on the lung cell surface is critical to determine the severity of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W1978922034,"Alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has been studied in a variety of organisms due to the involvement of this enzyme in mammalian processes such as non-alcoholic hepatocellular damage, and in plant processes such as C4 photosynthesis, post-hypoxic stress response and nitrogen use efficiency. To date, very few studies have made direct comparisons of AlaAT enzymes and fewer still have made direct comparisons of this enzyme across a broad spectrum of organisms. In this study we present a direct kinetic comparison of glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase (GPAT) activity for seven AlaATs and two glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferases (GGAT), measuring the KM values for the enzymes analyzed. We also demonstrate that recombinant expression of AlaAT enzymes in Eschericia coli results in differences in bacterial growth inhibition, supporting previous reports of AlaAT possessing bactericidal properties, attributed to lipopolysaccharide endotoxin recognition and binding. A probable lipopolysaccharide binding region within the AlaAT enzymes, homologous to a region of a lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in humans, was also identified in this study. The AlaAT enzyme differences identified here indicate that AlaAT homologues have differentiated significantly and the roles these homologues play in vivo may also have diverged significantly. Specifically, the differing kinetics of AlaAT enzymes and how this may alter the nitrogen use efficiency in plants is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2078893554,"This study aimed to compare the anti-neoplastic effects of an Uncaria tomentosa (UT) brute hydroethanolic (BHE) extract with those of two fractions derived from it. These fractions are choroformic (CHCl3) and n-butanolic (BuOH), rich in pentacyclic oxindole alkaloids (POA) and antioxidant substances, respectively. The cancer model was the subcutaneous inoculation of Walker-256 tumour cells in the pelvic limb of male Wistar rat. Subsequently to the inoculation, gavage with BHE extract (50 mg.kg−1) or its fractions (as per the yield of the fractioning process) or vehicle (Control) was performed during 14 days. Baseline values, corresponding to individuals without tumour or treatment with UT, were also included. After treatment, tumour volume and mass, plasma biochemistry, oxidative stress in liver and tumour, TNF-α level in liver and tumour homogenates, and survival rates were analysed. Both the BHE extract and its BuOH fraction successfully reduced tumour weight and volume, and modulated anti-oxidant systems. The hepatic TNF-α level indicated a greater effect from the BHE extract as compared to its BuOH fraction. Importantly, both the BHE extract and its BuOH fraction increased the survival time of the tumour-bearing animals. Inversely, the CHCl3 fraction was ineffective. These data represent an in vivo demonstration of the importance of the modulation of oxidative stress as part of the anti-neoplastic activity of UT, as well as constitute evidence of the lack of activity of isolated POAs in the primary tumour of this tumour lineage. These effects are possibly resulting from a synergic combination of substances, most of them with antioxidant properties."
https://openalex.org/W2052079689,"The dendritic cell (DC) coordinates innate and adaptive immunity to fight infections and cancer. Our observations reveal that DCs exposed to the microbial danger signal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) acquire a continuously changing activation/maturation phenotype. The DCs' initial mode of action is pro-inflammatory via up-regulation among others of the signaling molecule interleukin (IL) 12, which polarizes IFN-γ secreting type 1 helper T-cells (Th1). Within 24 hours the same DC switches from the pro- into an anti-inflammatory phenotype. This is mediated by autocrine IL-10 release and secretion of soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2RA) molecules. T-cells, when contacted with DCs during their anti-inflammatory phase loose their proliferative capacity and develop regulatory T-cell (Treg) -like anti-inflammatory functions indicated by IL-10 secretion and elevated FoxP3 levels. Studying the kinetics of IL-12 and IL-10 expression from LPS/IFN-γ activated myeloid DCs on a single cell level confirmed these observations. When T-cells are separated from DCs within 24 hours, they are spared from the anti-inflammatory DC activity. We conclude that, in addition to differentiation of DCs into distinct subsets, the observed sequential functional phases of DC differentiation permit the fine-tuning of an immune response. A better understanding of time-kinetic DC features is required for optimally exploiting the therapeutic capacity of DCs in cancer immune therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2038751674,"Objective The endothelial protein C-receptor (EPCR) is an endothelial transmembrane protein that binds protein C and activated protein C (APC) with equal affinity, thereby facilitating APC formation. APC has anticoagulant, antiapoptotic and antiinflammatory properties. Soluble EPCR, released by the endothelium, may bind activated neutrophils, thereby modulating cell adhesion. EPCR is therefore considered as a possible link between the anticoagulant properties of protein C and the inflammatory response of neutrophils. In the present study, we aimed to provide proof of concept for a direct binding of EPCR to the β2 –integrin Mac-1 on monocytic cells under static and physiological flow conditions. Measurements and Main Results Under static conditions, human monocytes bind soluble EPCR in a concentration dependent manner, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Binding can be inhibited by specific antibodies (anti-EPCR and anti-Mac-1). Specific binding was confirmed by a static adhesion assay, where a transfected Mac-1 expressing CHO cell line (Mac-1+ cells) bound significantly more recombinant EPCR compared to Mac-1+ cells blocked by anti-Mac-1-antibody and native CHO cells. Under physiological flow conditions, monocyte binding to the endothelium could be significantly blocked by both, anti-EPCR and anti-Mac-1 antibodies in a dynamic adhesion assay at physiological flow conditions. Pre-treatment of endothelial cells with APC (drotrecogin alfa) diminished monocyte adhesion significantly in a comparable extent to anti-EPCR. Conclusions In the present study, we demonstrate a direct binding of Mac-1 on monocytes to the endothelial protein C receptor under static and flow conditions. This binding suggests a link between the protein C anticoagulant pathway and inflammation at the endothelium side, such as in acute vascular inflammation or septicaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2041126467,"Many previous studies have shown that lesions of the peripheral vestibular system result in spatial memory deficits and electrophysiological dysfunction in the hippocampus. Given the importance of glutamate as a neurotransmitter in the hippocampus, it was predicted that bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) would alter the expression of NMDA and AMPA receptors in this area of the brain. Methods The expression of the NR1, NR2A, NR2B, GluR1, GluR2, GluR3 and GluR 4 glutamate receptor subunits, as well as calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) and phosphorylated CaMKIIα (pCaMKIIα), was measured in the rat CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus (DG) subregions of the hippocampus, at 24 h, 72 h, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months following BVD, using western blotting. In the 6 month group, half of the animals underwent spatial forced alternating training in a T-maze. Results and Discussion For the 24 h, 72 h, 1 week and 1 month data, there was no significant effect of surgery for any hippocampal subregion. However, for the 6 month data set, T maze training had a significant effect independently of surgery. The results of these experiments suggest that BVD is not associated with large changes in glutamate receptor subunit or CaMKIIα expression in the rat hippocampus, at least in terms of both the intra-cytoplasmic and membrane receptor subunits together, that western blotting can measure. However, spatial training-associated increases in glutamate receptor and CaMKIIα expression can be induced in BVD rats with impaired spatial performance. Therefore, the neurophysiological changes underlying BVD-induced spatial learning and memory deficits are more likely to be due to up and down regulation or changes in affinity/efficacy of glutamate receptors at the membrane level than changes in subunit transcription and transduction at the intra-cytoplasmic level."
https://openalex.org/W2045090781,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved treatment for reperfusing ischemic strokes. But widespread use of tPA is still limited by fears of inadvertently administering tPA in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Surprisingly, however, the assumption that tPA will worsen ICH has never been biologically tested. Here, we assessed the effects of tPA in two models of ICH. In a mouse model of collagenase-induced ICH, hemorrhage volumes and neurological deficits after 24 hrs were similar in saline controls and tPA-treated mice, whereas heparin-treated mice had 3-fold larger hematomas. In a model of laser-induced vessel rupture, tPA also did not worsen hemorrhage volumes, while heparin did. tPA is known to worsen neurovascular injury by amplifying matrix metalloproteinases during cerebral ischemia. In contrast, tPA did not upregulate matrix metalloproteinases in our mouse ICH models. In summary, our experimental data do not support the assumption that intravenous tPA has a deleterious effect in acute ICH. However, due to potential species differences and the inability of models to fully capture the dynamics of human ICH, caution is warranted when considering the implications of these findings for human therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2087312327,"Background Critically ill patients frequently develop acute lung injury (ALI). Disturbed alveolar fibrin turnover, a characteristic feature of ALI, is the result of both activation of coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis. Nebulized fibrinolytic agents could exert lung–protective effects, via promotion of fibrinolysis as well as anti–inflammation. Methods Rats were challenged intratracheally with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resulting in pneumonia as a model for direct ALI, or received an intravenous bolus infusion of lipopolysaccharide, as a model for indirect ALI. Rats were randomized to nebulization of normal saline (placebo), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), or monoclonal antibodies against plasminogen activator inhibitor–type 1 (anti–PAI–1). Results Nebulized rtPA or anti–PA1–1 enhanced the bronchoalveolar fibrinolytic system, as reflected by a significant reduction of PAI–1 activity levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and a consequent increase in plasminogen activator activity (PAA) levels to supranormal values. Both treatments also significantly affected systemic fibrinolysis as reflected by a significant increase in PAA levels in plasma to supranormal levels. Neither nebulized rtPA nor anti–PA1–1 affected pulmonary inflammation. Neither treatment affected bacterial clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lungs in case of pneumonia. Conclusions Local treatment with rtPA or anti–PA1–1 affects pulmonary fibrinolysis but not inflammation in models of direct or indirect ALI in rats."
https://openalex.org/W1985897045,"Background HIV-associated tuberculosis is a common coinfection in Sub-Saharan Africa, which causes high morbidity and mortality. A sub-set of HIV-associated tuberculosis patients require prolonged hospital admission, during which antiretroviral therapy initiation may be required. The aim of this study was to document the causes of clinical deterioration of hospitalised patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis starting antiretroviral therapy in order to inform healthcare practice in low- to middle-income countries. Methods Prospective, observational cohort study of adult inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis starting antiretroviral therapy in a dedicated tuberculosis hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Causes of clinical deterioration and outcome were recorded in the first 12 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. Patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis were excluded. Results Between May 2009 and November 2010, 112 patients (60% female), with a median age of 32 years were enrolled. At baseline the median CD4 count was 55 cells/mm3 (IQR 31–106) and HIV viral load 5.6 log copies/mL. All patients had significant comorbidity: 82% were bed-bound, 65% had disseminated tuberculosis and 27% had central nervous system tuberculosis. Seventy six patients (68%) developed 144 clinical events after starting antiretroviral therapy. TB-IRIS, hospital-acquired infections and significant drug toxicities occurred in 42%, 20.5% and 15% of patients respectively. A new opportunistic disease occurred in 15% of patients and a thromboembolic event in 8%. Mortality during the 12 week period was 10.6%. Conclusions High rates of TB-IRIS, hospital-acquired infections and drug toxicities complicate the course of patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis starting antiretroviral therapy in hospital. Despite the high morbidity, mortality was relatively low. Careful clinical management and adequate resources are needed in hospitalised HIV-TB patients in the 1st three months following ART initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2012447784,"Sacbrood virus (SBV) is a picorna-like virus that affects honey bees (Apis mellifera) and results in the death of the larvae. Several procedures are available to detect Chinese SBV (CSBV) in clinical samples, but not to estimate the level of CSBV infection. The aim of this study was develop an assay for rapid detection and quantification of this virus. Primers and probes were designed that were specific for CSBV structural protein genes. A TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probe-based, fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR was established. The specificity, sensitivity and stability of the assay were assessed; specificity was high and there were no cross-reactivity with healthy larvae or other bee viruses. The assay was applied to detect CSBV in 37 clinical samples and its efficiency was compared with clinical diagnosis, electron microscopy observation, and conventional RT-PCR. The TaqMan MGB-based probe fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR for CSBV was more sensitive than other methods tested. This assay was a reliable, fast, and sensitive method that was used successfully to detect CSBV in clinical samples. The technology can provide a useful tool for rapid detection of CSBV. This study has established a useful protocol for CSBV testing, epidemiological investigation, and development of animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2020706971,"The space-time permutation scan statistic (STPSS) is designed to identify hot (and cool) spots of space-time interaction within patterns of spatio-temporal events. While the method has been adopted widely in practice, there has been little consideration of the effect inaccurate and/or incomplete input data may have on its results. Given the pervasiveness of inaccuracy, uncertainty and incompleteness within spatio-temporal datasets and the popularity of the method, this issue warrants further investigation. Here, a series of simulation experiments using both synthetic and real-world data are carried out to better understand how deficiencies in the spatial and temporal accuracy as well as the completeness of the input data may affect results of the STPSS. The findings, while specific to the parameters employed here, reveal a surprising robustness of the method's results in the face of these deficiencies. As expected, the experiments illustrate that greater degradation of input data quality leads to greater variability in the results. Additionally, they show that weaker signals of space-time interaction are those most affected by the introduced deficiencies. However, in stark contrast to previous investigations into the impact of these input data problems on global tests of space-time interaction, this local metric is revealed to be only minimally affected by the degree of inaccuracy and incompleteness introduced in these experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2056944587,"Background In a recent phase II clinical trial for HNSCC patients, IRX-2, a cell-derived biologic, promoted T-cell infiltration into the tumor and prolonged overall survival. Mechanisms responsible for these IRX-2-mediated effects are unknown. We hypothesized that IRX-2 enhanced tumor antigen-(TA)-specific immunity by up-regulating functions of dendritic cells (DC). Methodology/Principal Findings Monocyte-derived DC obtained from 18 HNSCC patients and 12 healthy donors were matured using IRX-2 or a mix of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 (“conv. mix”). Multicolor flow cytometry was used to study the DC phenotype and antigen processing machinery (APM) component expression. ELISPOT and cytotoxicity assays were used to evaluate tumor-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). IL-12p70 and IL-10 production by DC was measured by Luminex® and DC migration toward CCL21 was tested in transwell migration assays. IRX-2-matured DC functions were compared with those of conv. mix-matured DC. IRX-2-matured DC expressed higher levels (p<0.05) of CD11c, CD40, CCR7 as well as LMP2, TAP1, TAP2 and tapasin than conv. mix-matured DC. IRX-2-matured DC migrated significantly better towards CCL21, produced more IL-12p70 and had a higher IL12p70/IL-10 ratio than conv. mix-matured DC (p<0.05 for all). IRX-2-matured DC carried a higher density of tumor antigen-derived peptides, and CTL primed with these DC mediated higher cytotoxicity against tumor targets (p<0.05) compared to the conv. mix-matured DC. Conclusion Excellent ability of IRX-2 to induce ex vivo DC maturation in HNSCC patients explains, in part, its clinical benefits and emphasizes its utility in ex vivo maturation of DC generated for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1999153310,"Insulin therapy improves β-cell function in early stages of diabetes by mechanisms that may exceed alleviation of glucotoxicity. In advance type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia causes β-cell damage and ultimately β-cell loss. At such an advanced stage, therapeutic modalities are often inadequate. Growing evidence indicates that in early stages of type-2 diabetes and some types of monogenic diabetes linked with malfunctioning endoplasmic-reticulum (ER), the β-cell ER fails to process sufficient proinsulin once it becomes overloaded. These changes manifest with ER distention (ER-crowding) and deficiency of secretory granules. We hypothesize that insulin therapy may improves β-cell function by alleviating ER-crowding. To support this hypothesis, we investigated pre-diabetic β-cell changes in hProC(A7)Y-CpepGFP transgenic mice that develop prolonged pre-diabetes due to proinsulin dysmaturation and ER-crowding. We attenuated the β-cell ER proinsulin synthesis with a treat-to-target insulin therapy while avoiding hypoglycemia and weight gain. Alleviation of ER-crowding resulted in temporary improvement in proinsulin maturation, insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. Our observations suggest that alleviation of pre-diabetic ER-crowding using a treat-to-target insulin therapy may improve β-cell function and may prevent further metabolic deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W2005803735,"Background Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognising Lewisy, such as BR96, have reached the clinic but have failed to show good anti-tumour responses with an acceptable level of toxicity. No Lewisb mAbs have been trialled in patients. In this study we compare the specificity of three mAbs; BR96 (Lewisy), 2-25 LE (Lewisb) and 692/29 that recognises a unique facet of both Lewisy and Lewisb. We then assessed the in vivo therapeutic effect of 692/29 using xenograft models. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a glycan array, each mAb was shown to display a different binding pattern with only 692/29 binding to both Lewisy and Lewisb. 692/29 was able to kill tumour cells over-expressing Lewisy/b directly, as well as by antibody and complement mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC/CDC), but failed to kill cells expressing low levels of these haptens. In contrast, BR96, directly killed cells expressing either high or low levels of Lewisy perhaps explaining its toxicity in patients. 2-25 LE failed to cause any direct killing but did mediate ADCC/CDC. Both 692/29 and BR96 bound to >80% of a panel of over 400 colorectal tumours whereas 2-25 LE showed lower reactivity (52%). 692/29 demonstrated more restricted normal tissue reactivity than both BR96 and 2-25 LE. 692/29 anti-Lewisy/b mAb also showed good in vivo killing in xenograft models. Conclusions/Significance MAbs targeting both Lewisy and Lewisb may have a therapeutic advantage over mAbs targeting just one hapten. 692/29 has a more restricted normal tissue distribution and a higher antigen threshold for killing which should reduce its toxicity compared to a Lewisy specific mAb. 692/29 has an ability to directly kill tumours whereas the anti-Lewisb mAb does not. This suggests that Lewisy but not Lewisb are functional glycans. 692/29 showed good anti-tumour responses in vivo and is a strong therapeutic candidate."
https://openalex.org/W2035447577,"Predators can affect prey populations and, via trophic cascades, predators can indirectly impact resource populations (2 trophic levels below the predator) through consumption of prey (density-mediated indirect effects; DMIEs) and by inducing predator-avoidance behavior in prey (trait-mediated indirect effects; TMIEs). Prey often employ multiple predator-avoidance behaviors, such as dispersal or reduced foraging activity, but estimates of TMIEs are usually on individual behaviors. We assessed direct and indirect predator effects in a mesocosm experiment using a marine food chain consisting of a predator (toadfish – Opsanus tau), prey (mud crab - Panopeus herbstii) and resource (ribbed mussel – Geukensia demissa). We measured dispersal and foraging activity of prey separately by manipulating both the presence and absence of the predator, and whether prey could or could not disperse into a predator-free area. Consumption of prey was 9 times greater when prey could not disperse, probably because mesocosm boundaries increased predator capture success. Although predator presence did not significantly affect the number of crabs that emigrated, the presence of a predator decreased resource consumption by prey, which resulted in fewer resources consumed for each prey that emigrated in the presence of a predator, and reduced the overall TMIE. When prey were unable to disperse, TMIEs on mussel survival were 3 times higher than the DMIEs. When prey were allowed to disperse, the TMIEs on resource survival increased to 11-times the DMIEs. We found that restricting the ability of prey to disperse, or focusing on only one predator-avoidance behavior, may be underestimating TMIEs. Our results indicate that the relative contribution of behavior and consumption in food chain dynamics will depend on which predator-avoidance behaviors are allowed to occur and measured."
https://openalex.org/W2094975012,"The eco-evolutionary dynamics of dispersal are recognised as key in determining the responses of populations to environmental changes. Here, by developing a novel modelling approach, we show that predators are likely to have evolved to emigrate more often and become more selective over their destination patch when their prey species exhibit spatio-temporally complex dynamics. We additionally demonstrate that the cost of dispersal can vary substantially across space and time. Perhaps as a consequence of current environmental change, many key prey species are currently exhibiting major shifts in their spatio-temporal dynamics. By exploring similar shifts in silico, we predict that predator populations will be most vulnerable when prey dynamics shift from stable to complex. The more sophisticated dispersal rules, and greater variance therein, that evolve under complex dynamics will enable persistence across a broader range of prey dynamics than the rules which evolve under relatively stable prey conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1985539829,"As neurons develop, several immature processes (i.e., neurites) grow out of the cell body. Over time, each neuron breaks symmetry when only one of its neurites grows much longer than the rest, becoming an axon. This symmetry breaking is an important step in neurodevelopment, and aberrant symmetry breaking is associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and autism. However, the effects of neurite count in neuronal symmetry breaking have never been studied. Existing models for neuronal polarization disagree: some predict that neurons with more neurites polarize up to several days later than neurons with fewer neurites, while others predict that neurons with different neurite counts polarize synchronously. We experimentally find that neurons with different neurite counts polarize synchronously. We also show that despite the significant differences among the previously proposed models, they all agree with our experimental findings when the expression levels of the proteins responsible for symmetry breaking increase with neurite count. Consistent with these results, we observe that the expression levels of two of these proteins, HRas and shootin1, significantly correlate with neurite count. This coordinated symmetry breaking we observed among neurons with different neurite counts may be important for synchronized polarization of neurons in developing organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1990307488,"Background and Aims Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are important manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) that reduce patients' health-related quality of life. Some NMS may also be caused by age-related changes, or manifested as a psychological reaction to a chronic neurological condition. This case-control study compared the NMS burden among PD patients, healthy controls and hemifacial spasm (HFS) patients. In addition, we determined the NMS that discriminated between PD and non-PD subjects. Methods 425 subjects were recruited from a tertiary hospital in Singapore (200 PD patients, 150 healthy controls and 75 HFS patients). NMS burden in subjects was measured using the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Results NMSS total score was significantly higher in PD patients (37.9±2.6) compared to healthy controls (11.2±0.9) (p<0.0001) and HFS patients (18.0±2.1) (p<0.0001). In addition, NMSS total score was significantly higher in HFS patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.003). PD patients experienced a higher NMS burden than healthy controls in all domains, and a higher NMS burden than HFS patients in all but attention/memory and urinary domains. NMS burden for HFS and healthy controls differed only in the sleep/fatigue and urinary domains. Using stepwise logistic regression, problems of ‘constipation’, ‘restless legs’, ‘dribbling saliva’, ‘altered interest in sex’ and ‘change in taste or smell’ were found to have significant discriminative power in differentiating between PD patients and healthy controls and between PD patients and HFS patients. Conclusion PD patients experienced a greater overall NMS burden compared to both healthy controls and HFS patients. HFS patients demonstrated a higher NMS burden than controls, and some NMS may be common to chronic neurological conditions while others are more specific to PD. Differentiating patients using NMS domains may help refine the clinical management of NMS in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2032929264,"Parents are expected to evolve tactics to care for eggs or offspring when providing such care increases fitness above the costs incurred by this behavior. Costs to the parent include the energetic demands of protecting offspring, delaying future fecundity, and increased risk of predation. We used cost-benefit models to test the ecological conditions favoring the evolution of parental care, using lizard populations that differ in whether or not they express maternal care. We found that predators play an important role in the evolution of maternal care because: (1) evolving maternal care is unlikely when care increases predation pressure on the parents; (2) maternal care cannot evolve under low levels of predation pressure on both parents and offspring; and (3) maternal care evolves only when parents are able to successfully defend offspring from predators without increasing predation risk to themselves. Our studies of one of the only known vertebrate species to exhibit interpopulation differences in the expression of maternal care provide clear support for some of the hypothesized circumstances under which maternal care should evolve (e.g., when nests are in exposed locations, parents are able to defend the eggs from predators, and egg incubation periods are brief), but do not support others (e.g., when nest-sites are scarce, life history strategies are ""risky"", reproductive frequency is low, and environmental conditions are harsh). We conclude that multiple pathways can lead to the evolution of parental care from a non-caring state, even in a single population of a widespread species."
