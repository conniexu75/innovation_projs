https://openalex.org/W2003575314,"After mature rats that had been fed on a vitamin D3-deficient diet were injected with tritium-labeled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, radioactivity became concentrated in nuclei of luminal and cryptal epithelium of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon; in nuclei of the epithelium of kidney distal tubules including the macula densa, and in podocytes of glomeruli; in nuclei of the epidermis including outer hairshafts and sebaceous glands; and in nuclei of certain cells of the stomach, anterior and posterior pituitary, and parathyroid. These results reveal cell types that contain receptors for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or metabolites of this compound both in known or hypothesized target tissues and in tissues that were previously unknown to participate in vitamin D3 metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1980437255,"A model of reverse transcription has been devised by which the detailed architecture of ten molecular structures is predicted. The model includes a number of novel features for which experimental evidence is presented. First, growing minus DNA strand is copied from the viral RNA only up to a position about 150 nucleotides from the 5' end of the RNA. Second, plus-strand DNA, after being copied from approximately 600 nucleotides at the 5' end of the minus-strand DNA, then transcribes the first approximately 20 nucleotides of the tRNApro primer (which is covalently attaced to the 5' end of the minus DNA strand). The 3' ends of the minus and plus DNA probably form a hybrid through the homology conferred by the primer binding site sequences. Third, the minus and plus DNA strands are elongated in a continuous fashion resulting in a linear double-stranded DNA molecule containing a 600 nucleotide direct repeat at both ends. The most of the features of the model have experimental support, and it appears to provide a credible description of reverse transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2069445267,"DNA prepared from 60 unrelated individuals was cleaved with one of eight different restriction endonucleases and the resulting DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments containing G gamma-, A gamma-, delta- or beta-globin genes were detected by Southern blot hybridization, using as probe either a 32P-labeled cloned DNA copy of rabbit beta-globin messenger RNA or labeled human beta- and G gamma- globin cDNA plasmids. Three types of variant restriction enzyme patterns of globin DNA fragments were detected in otherwise normal individuals. One variant pattern, found in only one person, was caused by an additional restriction endonuclease Pst I cleavage site in the center of the delta- globin gene intervening sequence; the subject was heterozygous for the presence of this cleavage site and was shown to have inherited it from her mother. Another variant pattern resulted from the appearance of an endonuclease Hind III cleavage site in the intervening sequence of the A gamma-globin gene; this variant is polymorphic, with a gene frequency for the presence of the intragenic Hind III site of 0.23. This Hind III cleavage site polymorphism is also found in the G gamma-globin gene intervening sequence and thus the polymorphism itself appears to be duplicated over the pair of gamma-globin loci. These variants can be used to derive an approximate estimate of the total number of different DNA sequence variants in man."

When foveal vision was masked, reading became difficult. In another condition, a window of readable text moved in synchrony with the eye, and parafoveal vision was masked on each fixation. The results point out the importance of foveal and parafoveal vision in reading."
https://openalex.org/W2014297207,"Serum-free media containing 10–50 ng insulin, glucagon and epidermal growth factor (EGF) ml−1 stimulate adult rat hepatocyte proliferation in 10–15 day old primary liver cell cultures. The kinetics of this response simulate hepatocellular transitions that accompany liver regeneration after 67% hepatectomy. Amiloride, a Na+ influx inhibitor, reversibly blocks these transitions in vitro (ID50 ∼0.02 mM) and in vivo (ID50 ∼25 mg kg−1). Inhibition is observed with other cation flux modulators, including ouabain (ID50 ∼0.2 mM), 0.2 μM monensin and 0.2 μM nigericin, but not with 0.3 mM furosemide or tetrodotoxin. The prereplicative interval in culture (0–12 hr) is characterized by preferential cellular responsiveness to EGF (0–3 hr) followed by insulin plus glucagon (3–12 hr). Parallel culture and animal studies show that the amiloride-sensitive and prereplicative intervals coincide. In culture, a “burst” of 22Na+ influx, stimulated by peptide-supplemented media within 1 min but decreased later at 12 hr, is retarded by amiloride. This drug also blocks delayed prereplicative events involving increased amino acid “A” transport system function at 4–8 hr, and 3H-uridine and 3H-leucine incorporation into RNA and protein, respectively, at 8–12 hr. These findings suggest that at least two time-ordered processes are necessary to initiate hepatic growth fully: first, activation of Na+ flux systems by peptides similar or identical to EGF; and second, potentiation of these and subsequent cellular events by the combined action of insulin plus glucagon."

In sheep deprived of food for 2 hours, as little as 0.01 picomole per minute suppressed feeding 35 percent 1 hour after beginning injection. Pentagastrin also decreased feeding in the 2-hour group, but only at a much higher dose range. Secretin had no effect. These findings support the hypothesis that cholecystokinin octapeptide acts on central nervous system structures that are involved in control of food intake."

Urinary PEA excretion is significantly higher in paranoid chronic schizophrenics than in nonparanoid chronic schizophrenics and normal controls. Diet, hospitalization, and medication do not account for differences in PEA concentrations. These findings offer some indication that PEA may be an endogenous amphetamine."
https://openalex.org/W2012282437,"Material in a chromatographic fraction from an extract of insulin-treated muscle stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in addipocyte mitochondria. This action was similar to insulin's activation of the enzyme in a plasma membrane-mitochondria mixture. Neither the chromatographic fraction nor insulin required adenosine triphosphate or magnesium ion (Mg2+), suggesting that both agents acted through a calcium-sensitive phosphatase. This fraction may contain a chemical mediator of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W1995519823,"Three cell surface components of mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, F9 antigens and the receptors to the lectins FBP and PNA, have been isolated from radiolabeled EC cells by indirect immunoprecipitation. All three were efficiently labeled with fucose, galactose and glucosamine, but scarcely at all with mannose. The high molecular weight glycopeptides characteristic of early embryonic cells were released as the major glycopeptides upon pronase digestion of the three markers. The binding sites to the two lectins are present in the high molecular weight glycopeptides. Furthermore, a close correlation exists between the disappearance of the high molecular weight glycopeptides from differentiating EC cells and the disappearance of the three markers from the surface of these cells. The large glycopeptides from the three markers have the following properties in common. First, they are not mucin-type glycopeptides with short oligosaccharides, glycolipids and acidic mucopolysaccharides, nor are they products of incomplete pronase digestion of conventional complex-type glycopeptides. Second, they do not contain appreciable amounts of Fucα1→2Gal or Fucα1→6GlcNAc linkages. Third, a significant fraction of the glycopeptides have the GlcNAcβ→Gal sequence in their core structure. We propose that the cell surface markers of EC cells have a class of large carbohydrate chains not found in typical surface markers of adult cells such as H-2, la and LETS."
https://openalex.org/W2084260408,"Under aerobic conditions, glucose is primarily catabolized by vascular smooth muscle to lactate, in spite of an adequate oxidative capacity. Although this is often considered to be indicative of some nonspecific metabolic insufficiency, there is evidence that aerobic glycolysis is specifically coupled to sodium and potassium transport processes, whereas oxidative metabolism is couple to contracticle energy requirements."

https://openalex.org/W1974268660,"When placed in a tank of water, aged rats (24 to 27 months old) showed marked impairments in swimming. Compared with young adult rats (3 to 4 months old), the older animals moved their limbs less vigorously and were less successful in keeping their heads above water. The young, but not old, rats maintained a position nearly horizontal to the water surface and planed across it. These movement dysfunctions of aged rats resemble those seen in young adult animals that have sustained injury to brain dopamine-containing neurons. The swimming impairments of the aged rats were reversed by the dopamine receptor stimulant apomorphine and by the biosynthetic precursor of dopamine, L-dopa. Thus, age-related alterations in brain dopaminergic systems may be responsible for some of the movement disturbances associated with senescence."

https://openalex.org/W2046248125,"The synthesis of glycoproteins and inhibition of protein glycosylation by tunicamycin were examined during development of preimplantation mouse embryos and trophoblast adhesion. Tunicamycin specifically inhibits glycosylation of asparaginyl residues of glycoproteins. Tunicamycin, 0.25-5.0 microgram/ml, had no effect on early cleavage or aggregation between embryos, but the embryos remained irreversibly uncompacted when control embryos developed to the blastocyst stage. Trophoblast adhesion and giant cell outgrowth were reversibly inhibited and the binding of Con A was also reduced. Incorporation of 3H-mannose into blastocysts was inhibited by 80%, but that of 3H-glucosamine and 3H-leucine by only 28 and 18%, respectively, in the presence of 1.0 microgram/ml tunicamycin. Qualitative analysis showed that the incorporation of the sugars was markedly reduced in the majority of the fractions, but the synthesis of these carbohydrate-deficient glycopeptides was essentially normal. However, protein-polysaccharide fractions with nearly 40% of the incorporated glucosamine and only 5% mannose and 1% leucine were insensitive to inhibition by tunicamycin. Membrane-bound N-glycosidically linked glycoproteins therefore evidently play an important role during compaction and in trophoblast adhesion of mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2019405850,"Concentrations of dopamine-related tetrahydroisoquinolines (salsolinol and O-methylated salsolinol) were significantly higher in the daily urine samples of alcoholic subjects admitted for alcohol detoxification than in the daily urine samples of nonalcoholic control subjects. Salsolinol concentrations in alcoholic subjects appeared to drop to trace (control) values 2 to 3 days after admission, following the disappearance of ethanol and its reactive metabolite acetaldehyde from the blood. These results indicate that physiologically active tetrahydroisoquinolines increase in humans during long-term alcohol consumption, presumably because of acetaldehyde's direct condensation with catecholamines. The presence of these or similar condensation products in the urine could be useful as clinical indicators of prior blood acetaldehyde concentrations in chronic alcoholics."

Therefore, the bottle-nosed dolphin is not protected by lung collapse from the decompression hazards of dives to depths shallower than 70 meters."

https://openalex.org/W1999333845,A laser-induced luminescence technique is introduced for probing the structure and equilibria of lanthanide complexes and lanthanide ion binding to macromolecules. The method involves the excitation of the 7F0 leads to 5D0 transition between nondegenerate levels in the europium(III) ion by means of an intense pulsed dye laser source. Excitation profits obtained by scanning the laser through the transition region reveal distinct peaks characteristic of individual europium(III) ion environments. The technique may be used to characterize the species present in complex equilibria in solution or to study europium(III) binding to macromolecules. Distinct europium(III) binding sites in thermolysin with long and short excited state lifetimes are observed.

https://openalex.org/W2014548352,"All of the chloroplast 23S ribosomal genes of C. reinhardii are interrupted by a 0.87 kb sequence (Rochaix and Malnoë, 1978). We have sequenced the DNA across the two ends of this intervening element. In parallel, we have examined the nucleotide sequences in the corresponding part of the 23S ribosomal RNA. This allowed us to locate precisely the boundaries between the coding (that is, transcribed into mature 23S rRNA) and the noncoding DNA. The results show that the intervening sequence is flanked by two identical sets of 3 bp (5′-CGT) oriented as direct repeats. In addition, a sequence of 5 bp (5′-CGTGA) lies exactly next to one end and is found very close (16 bp) to the other end, in the coding part of the gene. These two sets are also oriented as direct repeats. Finally, sequences near one end of the intervening element are found with a few alterations near the other end, but in an inverted orientation. Possible interpretations of these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2002521414,"We studied H1 gene expression in hybrids of Xenopus laevis (female) x Xenopus borealis (male) and saw paternal H1 synthesis in mid-blastulae, which indicates that the H1 genes are active by this stage. The behavior of the maternal store of H1 histone mRNA was studied in androgenetic haploids. In which all stored mRNA is of the laevis type and all new transcripts are borealis. This showed that the initial activation of H1 synthesis occurs entirely by mobilizing maternal transcripts and that these are then unstable, disappearing in a few hours, by the early gastrula stage."

In addition, dopamine agonists administered in vivo enhance glucose utilization in the region. Thus, neuronal function in this region is directly affected by dopamine and dopaminergic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2068197770,"Rats, with their fur clipped, pressed a lever to turn on an infrared lamp while in a cold chamber. When they were exposed to continuous-wave microwaves at 2450 megahertz for 15-minute periods, the rate at which they turned on the infrared lamp decreased as a function of the microwave power density, which ranged between 5 and 20 milliwatts per square centimeter. This result indicates that behaviorally significant levels of heating may occur at an exposure duration and intensities that do not produce measurable changes in many other behavioral measures or in colonic temperature. Further study of how microwaves affect thermoregulatory behavior may help us understand such phenomena as the reported ""nonthermal"" behavioral effects of microwaves."
https://openalex.org/W2090025235,"Sea urchin and mouse sperm that are labeled on their surfaces with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TMRTC) or 125I-diiodofluorescein isothiocyanate (125IFC) remain viable and can fertilize eggs. When sea urchin eggs were fertilized with 125IFC-labeled sperm, the radioactivity from the sperm was quantitatively transferred to the egg (at a ratio of one sperm equivalent per egg) and persisted in the embryo as it developed to the pluteus larval state (5 days at 12°C). The radioactivity was acid-precipitable and was associated with the particulate fraction of embryo homogenates. In addition, FITC-labeled sea urchin sperm were used to fertilize eggs, and the labeled components were followed by fluorescence microscopy. In the embryo, labeled sperm components were present as a discrete patch that was partitioned unequally during early cleavages. In experiments using mouse sperm labeled with TMRTC, the labeled sperm components were also transferred to the embryo as a discrete patch that was again distributed unequally after cleavage. This physiological cell fusion system therefore has distinctive characteristics: there is limited lateral mobility of surface components, which have a low turnover rate unlike that seen in other systems. In this paper, we discussed the possible morphogenetic role of this unusual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1992000103,"Specific cDNA probes of Moloney and AKR murine leukemia viruses have been prepared to characterize the proviral integration sites of these viruses in the genomes of Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice. The genetically transmitted Moloney provirus of Balb/Mo mice was detected in a characteristic Eco RI DNA fragment of 16 × 106 daltons. No fragment of this size was detected in tissue DNAs from Balb/c mice infected as newborns with Moloney virus. We conclude that a viral integration site, occupied in preimplantation mouse embryos, is not necessarily occupied when virus infects cells in post-natal animals. Balb/Mo and Balb/c mice do carry the AkR structural gene in an Eco RI DNA fragment of 12 × 106 daltons. Further restriction analysis of this fragment indicated that both mouse lines carry one AKR-type provirus. Leukemogenesis in Balb/Mo and newborn infected Balb/c mice is accompanied by reintegration of Moloney viral sequences in new chromosomal sites of tumor tissues. Part of the reintegrated Moloney viral sequences are of sub-genomic size. The AKR viral sequences, however, are not found in new sites. Further restriction analysis revealed that the development of Moloney virus-induced leukemia in Balb/Mo mice does not lead to detectable structural alteration of the genetically transmitted Moloney and AKR structural genes. Possible mechanisms of the reintegration process are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996386324,"Restriction endonuclease analysis of viral DNA extracted from wild-type and temperature-sensitive mutants of vaccinia IHD-W (Dales et al., 1978) revealed sequence alterations in approximately 20% of all ts clones examined. The rearrangements were due to deletions up to 250 nucleotide pairs long. Using Eco RI, Sal I, Bam I, Hpa I and Ava I, the deletions were always observed in the same fragments, while analysis with Hind III demonstrated deletions of identical size in the two terminal fragments. Since vaccinia virus contains inverted terminal repeats of more than 10 kb, these clones possess identical deletions of opposite orientation at both ends of the genome. Analysis of several revertants of the ts mutants demonstrated that the deletions probably arise as events independent from those producing ts lesions and are generated spontaneously at high frequency. This implies that a single event during replication caused the elimination of nonessential information, and suggests that circular intermediates must exist transiently during viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2070841245,"Erythropoietin (Epo) acts on mouse bone marrow cells in vitro in plasma clot or methyl cellulose culture systems to induce the formation of single erythroid colonies, or clusters of erythroid colonies termed bursts. Our laboratory has recently reported the observation that infection of mouse bone marrow cells in vitro with the polycythemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FV) resulted in the formation of erythroid bursts after 5 days in plasma clot culture in the absence of added Epo. We have now used this system to characterize the target cells for this FV-induced erythroid transformation. The greatest number of FV bursts were observed when marrow cells were obtained from mice whose erythropoiesis had been stimulated by bleeding or phenylhydrazine treatment. Bleeding also resulted in an increase in the number of FV bursts following the infection of spleen cells in vitro. Hypertransfusion of mice, which results in decreased erythropoiesis, yielded a reduced number of FV bursts in vitro, as did prior treatment with actinomycin D. Cell separation studies using velocity sedimentation at unit gravity showed that the cells, which give rise to FV bursts, sedimented with a modal sedimentation velocity between 5.1–8.5 mm/hr. The Epo-dependent colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E), which gives rise to a single erythroid colony, also sediments with a modal velocity between 5.1–8.5 mm/hr, while the Epo-dependent day 8 burst-forming unit erythroid (day 8 BFU-E) sediments with a modal velocity between 3.0–6.0 mm/hr. A 20 min incubation of marrow cells with high specific activity 3H-thymidine, prior to virus infection, resulted in a 75–80% reduction in the number of FV bursts. Mixing cells from the upper portion of the gradient, which yielded no FV bursts, with cells from an area in which high numbers of FV bursts were observed did not result in the inhibition of burst formation. These experiments indicate that the primary target cells for FV bursts in vitro are most probably erythroid precursor cells that have matured beyond the day 8 BFU-E and are closely related to the CFU-E."

https://openalex.org/W2094639948,"Abstract This report describes the identification and partial characterization of a 100K dalton cell surface protein of human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). This protein is released into and can be recovered virtually intact from the surrounding culture medium. At the present level of analysis, the protein recovered from the culture medium (conditioned medium) is indistinguishable from the protein extracted directly from the cell surface by 1 M urea treatment. Both proteins have molecular weights of 100K daltons when analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The protein is readily labeled at the cell surface via lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, and the label can be chased into the released form of this protein in conditioned medium. Antiserum raised against the medium form of the protein reacts with the surface form of the protein but does not react with fibronectin, the major cell surface protein of HDF. Conditioned medium from SV40-transformed human fibroblasts does not contain the 100K protein, but instead contains a component that has a slightly lower molecular weight (97K daltons). The lower molecular weight band does not iodinate at the cell surface and is apparently an underglycosylated form of the 100K protein. Its molecular weight is shifted back to 100K by growing transformed cells in medium containing excess glucose. After the shift, the component becomes accessible to the radioiodine label. We suggest that the 100K protein is a glucose-regulated protein (Shiu, Pouyssegur and Pastan, 1977; Pouyssegur and Yamada, 1978) that is released into the culture medium. An underglycosylated form of the same glycoprotein is released from transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083077261,In experiments designed to measure human cell survival sith +/- 2 percent accuracy it was found that low doses (21 to 87 rad) of gamma-rays inactivated the colony-forming ability of cultured human cells with a probability of 0.00226 +/- 0.00012 per rad.

https://openalex.org/W2089950159,"Increases in plasma prolactin concentrations produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a catecholamine synthesis inhibitor, varied inversely with baseline platelet monoamine oxidase activity in 12 patients with chronic schizophrenia. In normal volunteers with low monoamine oxidase activity and in unmedicated patients with chronic schizophrenia, plasma prolactin concentrations varied directly with platelet monoamine oxidase activity. No such relationship was found in normal subjects with high platelet monoamine oxidase activity. These data suggest that platelet monoamine oxidase activity reflects monoaminergic activity in the tubero-infundibular system, which in turn affects plasma prolactin concentrations. This relationship may be important in patients with low platelet monoamine oxidase activity, such as some chronic schizophrenics."
https://openalex.org/W2023918887,"tsAF8 and ts13 cells are temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of BHK cells that specifically arrest, at nonpermissive temperature, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These two mutants can complement each other. Both cell lines can be made quiescent by serum deprivation (G0). When subsequently stimulated by serum, they can enter S phase at 34 degrees C but not at 39.5 degrees-40.6 degrees C. We have used these mutants to determine whether the nucleus is needed during the G0 leads to S transition for the expression of the G1 ts functions. For this purpose, we fused cytoplasts of G0-tsAF8 with whole ts13 cells in G0, and cytoplasts of G0-ts13 with whole tsAF8 cells in G0. Serum stimulation at the nonpermissive temperature induced DNA synthesis in both types of such fusion products. No DNA synthesis was induced by serum stimulation at the nonpermissive temperature in fusion products constructed between either G0-tsAF8 cytoplasts and whole G0-tsAF8 cells or G0-ts13 cytoplasts and whole G0-ts13 cells. These results demonstrate that the information for these two ts functions, which are required for entry of serum-stimulated cells into the S phase, are already present in the cytoplasm of G0 cells--that is, before serum stimulation commits them to the transition from the nonproliferating to the proliferating state."
