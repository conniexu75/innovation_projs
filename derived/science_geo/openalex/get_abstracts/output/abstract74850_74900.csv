https://openalex.org/W1600532461,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase has been isolated from pig liver mitochondria and purified 208-fold from the initial mitochondrial acetone powder extract in good yield (48%). The enzyme appears homogeneous in sedimentation velocity experiments and has a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 5.21 S. Its molecular weight, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, is 73,300. The ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra of the enzyme revealed no characteristic chromophores. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is reported. At 30° mitochondrial P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase catalyzes the inosine diphosphate- and Mn++-dependent carboxylation of 664 moles of phosphoenolpyruvate per min per mole of enzyme at pH 7.0 and the ITP- and Mn++-dependent decarboxylation of 4650 moles of oxalacetate per min per mole of enzyme at pH 7.5. The enzyme exhibits a relatively high degree of specificity for inosine and guanosine nucleotides in the carboxylation, decarboxylation, and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reactions. IMP, GMP, and purified ITP exhibit absolutely no activity in the carboxylation reaction; IMP and ADP are completely inactive in the decarboxylation and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reactions. While purified IDP cannot replace ITP in the oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction; IDP can replace ITP in the decarboxylation reaction. In contrast to ITP-supported decarboxylation, IDP-supported decarboxylation leads to pyruvate rather than P-enolpyruvate formation. The enzyme is inhibited by low concentrations (10-6 m) of p-chloromercuribenzoate which can be reversed by high concentrations of glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1497254911,"Abstract d-Amino acid oxidase has been shown to have a critical temperature of 12–14°. Around this temperature it has been shown that a reversible change in protein conformation occurs; the change in enthalpy of the transition has been calculated as 78,000 cal per mole. Other parameters have also been shown to change on either side of this temperature; these include sedimentation constant, ultraviolet and visible spectra, and catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations show that with very reasonable assumptions sharp breaks in Arrhenius plots are possible. It is suggested that the numerous examples in the literature of anomalous Arrhenius plots may be due to thermally induced reversible changes in protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W1490093099,"The activity of pyruvate carboxylase in rat liver mitochondria was estimated by measuring the 14CO2 incorporation in the presence of pyruvate, adenosine triphosphate, magnesium, and inorganic phosphate. Malate, fumarate, and citrate were shown to be the main radioactive products. When glutamate was added to the system, radioactive aspartate was also formed. Oxalacetate accumulated in only minute amounts; it could not be trapped by enzymatic reactions outside the mitochondria. The amount of radioactive products was decreased by addition of creatine, and nearly abolished by glucose, when these were used as phosphoryl acceptors. About 40% of the incorporated 14CO2 in malate and aspartate was found in carbon 1 of these compounds, demonstrating that a high degree of randomization of the label had occurred. Pyruvate carboxylation was inhibited by ADP. The inhibition could be overcome by addition of inorganic phosphate which removed ADP by oxidative phosphorylation. Excess ATP did not relieve the inhibition. Addition of caprylate to the system caused a strong inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation and promoted the formation of radioactive malate and fumarate, whereas the accumulation of the other radioactive compounds was decreased. The data, together with previous information, indicate that phosphoenolpyruvate is synthesized from pyruvate by a pathway involving pyruvate carboxylation and formation of aspartate and malate inside the mitochondria, diffusion of these compounds into the cytosol, and their conversion to phosphoenolpyruvate via oxalacetate. The regulation of this pathway is discussed and a hypothesis as to how fatty acids could control gluconeogenesis is outlined."

The labeled protein apparently corresponds to protocollagen. the polypeptide precursor of collagen which serves as a substrate for the enzymatic synthesis of hydroxyproline."
https://openalex.org/W2052932420,"Tetrodotoxin, at concentrations up to 5 x 10(-6) gram per milliliter, has no effect on the spontaneous discharge in the smooth muscle of taenia coli. However, the spontaneous discharge is abolished by Mn(++) at a concentration of 0.5 millimole per liter. The contraction induced by immersing the muscle in isotonic KCl solution is also suppressed in the presence of Mn(++). Because Mn(++) is a specific suppressor of the spike induced by Ca(++) and tetrodotoxin is an inhibitor of the spike induced by Na(+), we suggest that Ca(++) is a charge carrier in the production of spike potential in the smooth muscle and that the entry of intervening Ca(++) through the membrane acts as a trigger for the contraction of smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1528400386,"Abstract The nature of the energy source for a representative nonfermenting Mycoplasma, Mycoplasma hominis type II, strain 07, has been studied. The results indicate that this microorganism can obtain energy from the metabolism of arginine by the arginine dihydrolase pathway. The conversion of arginine to ornithine, with the concomitant formation of an equimolar amount of adenosine triphosphate, is quantitatively sufficient to account for the estimated energy required for synthesis of macromolecules in growing cells. Thus the results indicate that arginine may be the major source of energy, but they cannot rule out contributions to energy generation from other unknown sources. Extracts of M. hominis 07 are exceedingly rich in the three enzymes of the arginine dihydrolase pathway. Purifications and characterizations of the three enzymes have been undertaken. Arginine deiminase and ornithine transcarbamylase have been purified to an essentially homogeneous state, and have been found to constitute approximately 10 and 4% respectively, of the soluble protein of cell extracts. The physical and kinetic properties are similar to those reported for the enzymes obtained from Streptococcus."
https://openalex.org/W1678423043,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase has been isolated from germinating peanut cotyledons and purified 2700-fold. The purified enzyme is approximately 80% pure as judged from sedimentation patterns, has a sedimentation coefficient (s20,w) of 13.9 S, and catalyzes the carboxylation of 50 µmoles of phosphoenolpyruvate per min per mg of protein (refractometrically determined) at 30°. Enzymatic carboxylation occurs optimally at pH 8.0 to 8.2. The Km values determined for HCO3-, phosphoenolpyruvate, and Mg2+ are 3.1 x 10-4, 5 to 6 x 10-4, and 3 to 4 x 10-4 m, respectively, at pH 7.9. Studies on the effect of pH on the Km values for phosphoenolpyruvate and Mg2+ were conducted. Evaluation of plots of -log Km (Mg2+ and phosphoenolpyruvate) against pH indicate that a dissociable group (or groups) of the carboxylase having a pK of 7.3, presumably an imidazole group, is involved in Mg2+ and phosphoenolpyruvate binding. Other evidence supporting this view is presented. During the enzymatic carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate, 18O from substrate HC18O3- is incorporated into the orthophosphate and oxalacetate reaction products in a ratio of 1:2. This indicates that the HCO3- (or CO32-) anion rather than CO2 is the active species in the carboxylation reaction. A mechanism is proposed which is consistent with this and other observations on the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase-catalyzed reaction."
https://openalex.org/W170291133,"Abstract The degree of inhibition of rat intestinal alkaline phosphatase by l-phenylalanine was highly pH-dependent and varied from 0 to 66% within a pH range of 7.8 to 10.4, exhibiting a peak at pH 9.2 and 8.7 for phenylphosphate and β-glycerophosphate, respectively. Vmax was also a function of pH with and without the inhibitor. Rat intestinal alkaline phosphatase exhibited maximum enzyme activity at pH 9.8 and 8.8 with substrates, phenylphosphate and β-glycerophosphate, respectively, in presence of the noninhibitor, d-phenylalanine. The corresponding pH optima in the presence of l-phenylalanine inhibitor were 10.2 and 9.3, respectively. This shift in optimum pH by the inhibitor was observed in systems containing carbonate-bicarbonate or borate buffers. The Michaelis constant was pH-dependent. The Dixon plot (pKm with respect to pH) showed one discontinuity at pH 8.6 for the free enzyme and another at pH 9.6 for the enzyme-phenylphosphate complex. The values for the energy of activation for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of phenylphosphate with and without l-phenylalanine were 18,000 and 6,000 calories per mole, respectively. The inhibition was greatly dependent on substrate and inhibitor concentrations, and was of the uncompetitive type, because the double reciprocal plots of velocity and substrate concentrations in the presence of four different concentrations of l-phenylalanine were all straight lines parallel to those obtained without the inhibitor, in both the cases of phenylphosphate and β-glycerophosphate. At this time, the kinetic data are interpreted as indicating either the formation of a thermodynamically stable enzyme-inhibitor-substrate complex which, in effect, reduces the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex available to decompose into products or the production of a weakly dissociable enzyme-inhibitor-substrate complex. These interpretations are relevant to the explanation of the stereo-specific, organ-specific inhibition of rat intestinal alkaline phosphatase by l-phenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1495694553,"Abstract Norepinephrine was isolated from the flagellated protozoan, Crithidia fasciculata, and the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena pyriformis, the former having less than one-half that of the latter. Tetrahymena also synthesizes epinephrine, whereas this substance could not be detected in Crithidia. Isotopically labeled phenylalanine, tyrosine, and dihydroxyphenylalanine were significantly incorporated into the catecholamines in Tetrahymena, while only tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine were incorporated in Crithidia, owing to its lack of a phenylalanine-hydroxylating system."
https://openalex.org/W1483206164,"Abstract The construction and performance of a fluorescence polarization spectrophotometer is described, the parts of which are mostly commercially available items. The instrument uses two photomultipliers to detect separately each polarized component of the fluorescent light. The ratio of the components is plotted continuously by means of a ratio recorder while the wave length of the exciting light is changed at uniform speed. A servomechanism keeps the slits to the minimum value compatible with the sensitivity of the instrument. We obtained maximum resolution on the excitation side by allowing the broadest possible band of fluorescence, selected by broad band or low pass optical filters, to reach the photomultipliers. The use of fluorescence polarization spectrophotometry in investigation of proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1487791087,"Abstract Turnover of whole histones of brain and liver nuclei was studied after administration of 14C-lysine to adult mice. The radioactivity of histones and other nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins was determined at intervals from 2 hours to 245 days. Two fractions of cerebral histones with halflifetimes of 54 and 104 days and three fractions of hepatic histones with half-lifetimes of 18, 56, and 93 days were found. A larger number of fractions with gradually increasing turnover rates are not excluded. The histones of brain and liver turn over at a lower rate than any of the nuclear and cytoplasmic protein fractions measured in the respective organs. In order to label histones with a very low rate of turnover, 14C-lysine was administered to pregnant mice and the turnover of histones was estimated in their offspring after reaching maturity. In the brain only a slow histone fraction with a half-lifetime of 117 days and in the liver two fractions with half-lifetimes of 58 and 105 days were observed. Over a period from 2 to 8½ months in the brain and from 5 to 8½ months in the liver the decrease in the specific activity of histones was very small, corresponding to a replacement rate of about 0.6% per day. The turnover rates of histones may reflect division and replacement of various cellular species. The data suggest a metabolic stability of histones which corresponds to that of deoxyribonucleic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2089522893,"Diethylnitrosamine was continuously administered to rats at a dose rate of low toxicity. Ninety-two percent of the animals died with multicentrical hepatocellular carcinomata within a narrow and highly reproducible time interval. Discontinuing the carcinogen during the experiment resulted in a prolonged median time until death, a reduced tumor yield, and a lessened slope of the dose-response curve. Partial hepatectomy after discontinuation of the drug did not change either tumor yield or time of death. The obtained dose-response relationships support the concept that carcinogenic effects of single doses are irreversible and cumulative. Daily, low-dose, total-body x-irradiation had no significant effect on the response of rat liver to the carcinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1731391170,"Abstract Comparative kinetic studies at pH 6.8, 7.3, and 8.0 reveal that the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-catalyzed inosine triphosphate-dependent oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange is much more rapid than either the over-all decarboxylation or carboxylation reactions. At pH 6.8, the relative carboxylation, decarboxylation, and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange rates are 1.0, 8.3, and 30, respectively. While the pH optima for all three reactions are essentially the same (pH 6.6), the shapes of pH optimum curves for the carboxylation and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction differ markedly from that for the decarboxylation reaction. Under conditions which permit rapid P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase-catalyzed oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange; neither GTP-GDP-8-14C-, ITP-32 P-enolpyruvate-, nor oxalacetate-P-enolpyruvate-1-14C-exchange occurs at a significant rate. The inability of carboxykinase to catalyze these exchange reactions renders unlikely (a) the formation of phosphorylenzyme from GTP (or ITP) and enzyme as a step in the oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction or (b) the dissociation of either enzyme-P-enolpyruvate or enzyme-IDP (or GDP) as a rate-limiting step in the over-all decarboxylation reaction. The results support a two-step reaction sequence in which an ITP-dependent cleavage of the β-carboxyl carbon—carbon bond of oxalacetate yields HCO3- (or CO2) and an intermediate containing the elements of ITP and a 3 carbon moiety derived from carbon atoms 1, 2, and 3 of oxalacetate. Two mechanisms compatible with these results and other known characteristics of the reaction are proposed. Kinetic constants (Km and V values) for all substrates and cofactors of the carboxykinase-catalyzed carboxylation, decarboxylation, and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction were determined. The Km values (0.025 m and 0.027 m, respectively) for bicarbonate in the carboxylation (pH 7.5) and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange (pH 7.3) reactions were in close agreement. Bicarbonate is a competitive inhibitor (with respect to oxalacetate) of the decarboxylation reaction. Competition between oxalacetate and HCO3- is also evident in the oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction suggesting a common HCO3- and β-carboxyl site on the enzyme. The Km values (1.6 to 5.8 x 10-4 m, pH 7.3) for ITP and GTP in the decarboxylation and oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction determined under similar conditions agreed closely. The oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange reaction is strongly inhibited by P-enolpyruvate, whereas, the decarboxylation rate is unaffected at similar P-enolpyruvate concentrations. Both the oxalacetate-H14CO3- exchange and decarboxylation reactions are inhibited by GMP and GDP."

The immunologically deficient lymphocytes appear, however, to confer tolerance, and at least some enlarge and divide when stimulated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin, or xenogeneic or allogeneic cells. Small lymphocytes from thymectomized animals have defective RNA metabolism as judged by a marked impairment in their ability to incorporate uridine-5-H(3) or cytidine-H(3) in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1502576549,"Abstract The stoichiometry between horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H2O2 in the formation of Complexes I and II was spectrophotometrically studied by titrating HRP with H2O2 in the presence and absence of added reducing agents. The molar stoichiometry between H2O2 added and Complex II formed was found to be 1:1 in the presence and absence of added reducing agents. No evidence was obtained that more than 1 mole of Complex II was formed per mole of H2O2 added. The titration of Complex II with ferrocyanide confirmed George's finding that Complex II retained only 1 oxidizing equivalent per enzyme hematin unit. The oxidation of ascorbate and ferrocytochrome c upon additions of stoichiometric quantities of H2O2 in the presence of HRP exhibited two-phased kinetics: a very rapid initial oxidation followed by a slower secondary oxidation. These results were consistent with the currently accepted mechanism of the HRP reaction of Equations 2, 5, and 6. The titration of an enzyme-H2O2 complex (Complex ES) of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase with ferrocyanide indicated that Complex ES retained 2 oxidizing equivalents per enzyme hematin unit. No reducing equivalent of added donors was consumed in the process of the formation of Complex ES from cytochrome c peroxidase. The added donors were oxidized only in the process of the conversion of Complex ES to cytochrome c peroxidase. These results were consistent with the cytochrome c peroxidase mechanism of Equations 7 and 8. Complex ES of cytochrome c peroxidase was compared with Complex II of HRP."
https://openalex.org/W1516693422,"Abstract Threonyl ribonucleic acid synthetase was purified 400-fold from rat liver. During stepwise chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, two fractions with this enzymatic activity were observed. The separated fractions give distinct elution patterns on rechromatography on the same ion exchanger. Threonyladenylate-enzyme complex prepared with 14C-threonine and 3H-adenosine triphosphate shows a stoichiometry of 1:0.96 of threonine to adenosine 5'-phosphate. Threonyl transfer from the enzyme-bound complex to soluble RNA is inhibited slightly by AMP but strongly inhibited by pyrophosphate and by the combination of AMP and pyrophosphate. The transfer reaction is completely inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate but this inhibition can be overcome by addition of an excess of magnesium. The amino acid is transferred very rapidly, achieving complete transfer in less than 2 min at 37° and in 12 min at 0°. The threonyladenylate-enzyme complex can be chromatographed in active form on DEAE-cellulose ion exchanger. At pH 7.0 and 37°, the half-life of the complex is approximately of 7 min and its rate of inactivation coincides with the hydrolysis of synthetic threonyladenylate. At pH 4.5, the half-life is of approximately 4 min and is determined by the inactivation of the enzyme moiety. Threonyl-RNA synthetase can become labeled by incubation with radioactive ATP and magnesium in the absence of added threonine."
https://openalex.org/W1547548008,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion and proton-binding properties of bovine β-lactoglobulins A, B, and C have been examined as a function of pH. It was found that the b0 parameter remains constant between pH 2.5 and 10.5, while a0 undergoes large changes, from values of approximately -150 at pH 4 and below to -600 at pH 12. Two conformational changes occur in all three genetic variants, between pH 4 and 6, and pH 6.5 and 9.5, respectively. The first is accompanied by the liberation to titration of 1 cationic residue per chain in the C variant, with no similar effect in variants A and B. In the second transition an abnormal carboxyl per chain becomes ionizable in all three variants, as has been shown to occur in the A and B proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1558927284,"Abstract The binding kinetics of H2S and imidazole by sperm whale metmyoglobin has been studied in the pH range from pH 5.0 to 8.0 by the temperature jump technique. The pH dependence of the bimolecular binding rate constant has been interpreted in terms of mechanisms involving zero, one, and two heme-linked ionizing groups on the protein. Only a mechanism involving two ionizing groups on the protein with pK values of 4.7 and 5.7 can fit all the data. The rate constants obtained for the individual steps of this mechanism are consistent with an electrostatic model for the binding process. The E-7 histidine group and the carboxyl group of a propionic acid residue attached to the heme group are postulated to be the ionizing groups with pK values of 5.7 and 4.7, respectively. A systematic method for analyzing pH-dependent bimolecular rate data is outlined for those reactions which have reactants with several ionizable groups affecting the binding kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1548449468,"Abstract The order of addition of magnesium and glucose 1-phosphate to the phosphoenzyme (monophosphate phase) and of magnesium and glucose 1,6-diphosphate to the dephosphoenzyme (diphosphate phase) was investigated via substrate-velocity and equilibrium-isotope exchange experiments. All pathways ordered in both phases of the reaction were ruled out leaving only pathways random in one or both phases of the reaction; indicative evidence suggests that the pathway is actually random in both phases. The variations in maximum velocity and in the Michaelis constant for magnesium are described as a function of pH; the maximum velocity in the forward reaction is independent of pH from 6.5 to 8.3 while the Michaelis constant for magnesium depends on the basic form of two groups with pKa values in the range of 7.0 to 8.5."

https://openalex.org/W1630268927,"Abstract A cell-free system for the synthesis of a phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactor from guanosine triphosphate was obtained from extracts of Pseudomonas species (ATCC 11299a). This preparation produced formic acid from the ureido carbon of labeled GTP. The preparation also made specific pteridines from GTP. Among the products, xanthopterin, neopterin, and a cyclic phosphate derivative of neopterin were tentatively identified. These were probably present in a reduced form in the reaction mixtures. The requirements for cofactor synthesis include GTP, Mg++, and a reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide-generating system. Although the exact structure of the cofactor produced could not be determined, it was shown that a number of possible reduced pteridine products could serve as cofactors for the hydroxylase enzyme. Evidence is presented that the various reactions described are part of the over-all biosynthetic pathway for reduced pteridines which can serve as phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactors."
https://openalex.org/W1623883276,"Abstract Addition of Ca++ to rat liver mitochondria suspended in buffered 80 mm KCl or NaCl causes activation of respiration, uptake of Ca++, and ejection of H+, followed by return of the respiratory rate to a resting steady state in which there are no further net movements of Ca++ and H+. However, when the KCl concentration is only 20 mm, the Ca++-induced respiratory jump is followed by a period in which the resting respiration remains constant at a low resting rate, but in which the inverse Ca++-H+ exchange between mitochondria and medium undergoes oscillations. The oscillations are observed also after the accumulation of Sr++, but not after Mn++. They are maximal in media containing impermeant anions such as chloride, bromide, iodide, and thiocyanate. The oscillations are modified by buffer species and pH. Oscillations in the Ca++-H+ exchange do not occur in the presence of ATP, Mg++, sucrose, or permeant anions such as phosphate or acetate. The oscillations appear to depend in part on reverse electron flow from succinate to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Since the mitochondria appear to behave in a self-correcting manner, the oscillations in the inverse Ca++ and H+ movements are rationalized in terms of a feedback relationship between Ca++ influx and efflux."
https://openalex.org/W1482065253,"Abstract Hog pancreatic α-amylase interacted with macromolecular limit dextrins of glycogen to form stable complexes. These were characterized by ultracentrifugation, light scattering, and electron microscopy. The sedimentation coefficient of the complex varied in the range of 7 S to 23 S depending on the dextrin to enzyme ratio in the reaction mixture. The S values of the enzyme and the dextrin were about 4.5 and 3, respectively. Light scattering measurements showed that the complex reached a molecular weight of about 3 x 105. Since the molecular weight of the enzyme and the dextrin were 5 x 104 and 7 x 104, respectively, it could be concluded that the enzyme and the dextrin interact to form a multimolecular complex. Electron microscopy indeed indicated formation of chains consisting of several units. The existence on the enzyme of two apparently independent binding sites, required for the formation of a multimolecular complex, was also demonstrated. Measurements by equilibrium dialysis showed that 1 mole of enzyme specifically bound 2 moles of maltotriose."

Denaturation with acid indicated disorganization of the macromolecules, whereas heating at 50° with decyl sulfate induced a transition indicating the presence of the α-helical conformation in a part of the chains. The finding of Hamaguchi and Migita that the antigenic Type K (or I) proteins in 40% chloroethanol have more negative b0 values than the Type L (or II) proteins was confirmed.

https://openalex.org/W1500845578,"Abstract A previous study with substrate quantities of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and tritium-labeled ethanol had shown that the dehydrogenase protein became labeled in the methylene group of a tryptophan residue by the hydrogen atom that is transferred. The labeled protein was precipitated when the enzymatic reaction at equilibrium at pH 9 to 11 was interrupted by heat or addition of HClO4 (1). The present investigation showed a similar labeling when the enzyme was inactivated by 6 m guanidinium chloride or 0.8 m sodium hydroxide. In all four cases studied, the label appeared in tryptophan after acid hydrolysis of the protein. Inactivation of the enzyme by N-bromosuccinimide or silver nitrate did not result in labeled protein. Since classical enzymatic and alkaline hydrolytic methods gave unsatisfactory or inconclusive results, a new method of nonacidic protein hydrolysis (2.4 m sodium phosphate, pH 12, 3 to 20 hours at 111°) was developed and applied to the system. The tritium label was also found in the methylene group of tryptophan after heat precipitation and phosphate hydrolysis of the enzyme. Further study of incomplete enzymatic reactions confirmed the requirement for an equilibrium mixture of substrates and coenzymes for the labeling of tryptophan. Experiments with omission of substrates, with tritium-labeled diphosphopyridine nucleotide as a source of label, showed that perchloric acid precipitated the protein in labeled form. This labeling reaction differed from that of the complete system in that the labeled residue was not tryptophan. Similar experiments with omission of DPN, and with ethanol-1-3H and acetaldehyde, did not yield labeled protein. Tryptophan uniformly labeled with tritium was converted into N-acetyltryptophan, N-acetyl-5,7-dibromodioxindolylalanine lactone, and indole, and the radioactivity of these derivatives was determined. It was established that indole does not exchange the tritium label with solvent protons during its formation."

In lithium-Locke, ganglionic transmission and depolarization evoked by acetylcholine were blocked completely but reversibly, while the depolarization produced by potassium ions was unaltered."
https://openalex.org/W1485654755,"Abstract Individual rabbits received injections of bovine serum albumin (BSA) coupled with equivalent amounts of p-azophenylarsonate (As) and p-azophenyl-N-trimethylammonium (R4N) ions. Injection of the doubly labeled azoprotein ensured initial equal distribution of the two haptens among the cells involved in antibody formation. The immune sera of the injected animals contained hapten-specific antibodies of the types anti-As and anti-R4N, and a mixture of protein-specific antibodies directed against the various determinant groups of BSA. The hapten-specific antibodies were separated from each other and from anti-BSA by means of immunosorbents containing As or R4N residues bound to hydroxyphenylazobenzyl cellulose. Anti-As and anti-R4N were digested with trypsin and chymotrypsin. Peptide maps of the digests of the two antibodies were extremely similar. Usually, small differences in one or two peptide spots were observed. However, small differences were also found between antibodies produced by an individual rabbit at different times and between antibodies produced in various rabbits of the same injection series. Column chromatograms of the enzymatic digests of the two hapten-specific antibodies, anti-As and anti-R4N, showed only 20 to 25 peaks, most of them identical in both types of antibodies. Although differences in one or two peaks were observed, they were not the same when the two hapten-specific antibodies were prepared from an immune serum taken from the same animal at another time, or from the immune serum of another rabbit. Starch gel electrophoresis of the reduced and alkylated peptide chains of the purified hapten-specific antibodies at pH 8.2 revealed the presence of two cathodic bands produced by the A chains, and 6 to 8 narrow anodic bands of B chains. The A chains of anti-As migrated consistently faster cathodically than those of anti-R4N. The patterns of bands formed by the B chains of anti-As and anti-R4N were very similar; although differences in the intensity of some of the bands were observed, they were not found consistently, and they varied in the antibodies isolated from an individual rabbit at different times. Larger differences were produced by disk electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. Our results show that each of the two purified hapten-specific antibodies consists of a mixture of antibody molecules differing from each other by 6 to 8 types of B chains, possibly also by heterogeneity of the A chains. The absence of any consistent difference between the peptide maps or column chromatograms of the digests of anti-As and anti-R4N raises the possibility that heterogeneity involves not only the non-specific parts of the antibody molecules but also the combining sites, and that the specific combining site of a hapten-specific antibody such as anti-As may be formed by various amino acid sequences, each of these resulting in a conformation which fits closely to the homologous hapten."
https://openalex.org/W1572421549,"Abstract The unusual thermosolubility properties of Bence-Jones proteins have been investigated by the technique of ultracentrifugation at elevated temperature. Study of several purified Bence-Jones proteins has allowed description of the molecular changes that occur upon heating. Although the proteins participate in a common phenomenon, individual differences in their ultracentrifugal properties at high temperatures were observed. In certain cases an initial polymerization, followed by a depolymerization to an unfolded molecule, occurred as the temperature was raised. Sulfhydryl-binding reagents had little effect on the high temperature reactions, whereas ethanol, urea, detergents, or salts had a large effect. Therefore, the precipitation and redissolution phenomenon is attributed to alterations in the noncovalent bonding and tertiary structure of the Bence-Jones protein."
https://openalex.org/W1519040251,Abstract This paper presents a kinetic study of the transamidinase reaction. The following results have been obtained. 1. The kinetic data are in agreement with a reaction mechanism involving two half-reactions with exclusively binary complexes between substrate and enzyme. 2. The true amidine acceptor is the form of the substrate bearing the unprotonated amino group. This has been demonstrated for hydroxylamine and glycine. 3. k1 and k5 vary as a function of the pH. This variation is related to the dissociation of a group or groups of the enzyme with a pK of approximately pH 8.5.

https://openalex.org/W1497353342,"Abstract Liver, carcass (rat), and plasma (dog) glutamic and aspartic acids have been isolated from rats and dogs given lysine-2- or -6-14C. In some instances considerable non-carboxyl labeling was observed in glutamate and aspartate, presumably resulting from lysine catabolism by intestinal flora. Lysine-6-14C yielded tissue glutamate labeled predominantly in carbon 1, and lysine-2-14C yielded tissue glutamate labeled predominantly in carbon 5. These results indicate that during the mammalian catabolism of lysine, glutaryl coenzyme A, but not free glutaric acid, is a major intermediate."

This increase has been shown to result from synthesis de novo of the entire polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1572555257,"Abstract Two forms of the imidazole hemochrome of heme a have been found. One of these, referred to as the weakly interacting form, has typical hemochrome spectra and properties, but the other, the strongly interacting form, is abnormal. The latter form does not react with sodium borohydride or carbon monoxide, but these reactivities may be restored by treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate. The two forms exist as a mixture, and are interconvertible under the proper conditions. Complete conversion to the weakly interacting form can be attained, but not complete conversion to the other form. Heme-heme interaction is held to be responsible for these unusual properties. The ferrous absorption bands of the weakly interacting form are at 591, 513, and 437 mµ, while those of the strongly interacting form are at 594, 513, and 453 mµ. The strongly interacting form is proposed as a new model for cytochrome a."
