https://openalex.org/W243046624,"The Taiwan Government issued a policy to restrict antimicrobial usage since 2001. We aimed to assess the changes in the antibiotic consumption and the primary resistance of H. pylori after this policy and the impact of virulence factors on resistance.The defined daily dose (DDD) of antibiotics was analyzed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) research database. H. pylori strains isolated from treatment naïve (N=1395) and failure from prior eradication therapies (N=360) from 9 hospitals between 2000 and 2012 were used for analysis. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by agar dilution test. Genotyping for CagA and VacA was determined by PCR method.The DDD per 1000 persons per day of macrolides reduced from 1.12 in 1997 to 0.19 in 2008, whereas that of fluoroquinolones increased from 0.12 in 1997 to 0.35 in 2008. The primary resistance of amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline remained as low as 2.2%, 7.9%, 23.7%, and 1.9% respectively. However, the primary levofloxacin resistance rose from 4.9% in 2000-2007 to 8.3% in 2008-2010 and 13.4% in 2011-2012 (p=0.001). The primary resistance of metronidazole was higher in females than males (33.1% vs. 18.8%, p<0.001), which was probably attributed to the higher consumption of nitroimidazole. Neither CagA nor VacA was associated with antibiotic resistance.The low primary clarithromycin and metronidazole resistance of H. pylori in Taiwan might be attributed to the reduced consumption of macrolides and nitroimidazole after the national policy to restrict antimicrobial usage. Yet, further strategies are needed to restrict the consumption of fluoroquinolones in the face of rising levofloxacin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2158516064,"To study performance of a contact lens sensor (CLS) for 24-hour monitoring of IOP-related short-term patterns and compare with IOP obtained by pneumatonometry.Prospective clinical trial. Thirty-one healthy volunteers and 2 glaucoma patients were housed for 24 hours in a sleep laboratory. One randomly selected eye was fitted with a CLS (Triggerfish, Sensimed, Switzerland), which measures changes in ocular circumference. In the contralateral eye, IOP measurements were taken using a pneumatonometer every two hours with subjects in the habitual body positions. Heart rate (HR) was measured 3 times during the night for periods of 6 minutes separated by 2 hours. Performance of CLS was defined in two ways: 1) recording the known pattern of IOP increase going from awake (sitting position) to sleep (recumbent), defined as the wake/sleep (W/S) slope and 2) accuracy of the ocular pulse frequency (OPF) concurrent to that of the HR interval. Strength of association between overall CLS and pneumatonometer curves was assessed using coefficients of determination (R2).The W/S slope was statistically significantly positive in both eyes of each subject (CLS, 57.0 ± 40.5 mVeq/h, p<0.001 and 1.6 ± 0.9 mmHg/h, p<0.05 in the contralateral eye). In all, 87 CLS plots concurrent to the HR interval were evaluated. Graders agreed on evaluability for OPF in 83.9% of CLS plots. Accuracy of the CLS to detect the OPF was 86.5%. Coefficient of correlation between CLS and pneumatonometer for the mean 24-h curve was R2 = 0.914.CLS measurements compare well to the pneumatonometer and may be of practical use for detection of sleep-induced IOP changes. The CLS also is able to detect ocular pulsations with good accuracy in a majority of eyes.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01390779."
https://openalex.org/W336919607,"FBXO32 (MAFbx/Atrogin-1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is markedly up-regulated in muscle atrophy. Although some data indicate that FBXO32 may play an important role in tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanism of FBXO32 in tumorigenesis has been poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that FBXO32 targets the oncogenic protein c-Myc for ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome pathway. Phosphorylation of c-Myc at Thr-58 and Ser-62 is dispensable for FBXO32 to induce c-Myc degradation. Mutation of the lysine 326 in c-Myc reduces c-Myc ubiquitination and prevents the c-Myc degradation induced by FBXO32. Furthermore, overexpression of FBXO32 suppresses c-Myc activity and inhibits cell growth, but knockdown of FBXO32 enhances c-Myc activity and promotes cell growth. Finally, we show that FBXO32 is a direct downstream target of c-Myc, highlighting a negative feedback regulation loop between c-Myc and FBXO32. Thus, FBXO32 may function by targeting c-Myc. This work explains the function of FBXO32 and highlights its mechanisms in tumorigenesis. FBXO32 (MAFbx/Atrogin-1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is markedly up-regulated in muscle atrophy.

This work explains the function of FBXO32 and highlights its mechanisms in tumorigenesis. FBXO32 (also known as MAFbx or Atrogin-1) was originally identified as a muscle-specific gene required for muscle atrophy (1Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K.M. Nunez L.

FBXO32 was designated as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase because it contains the F-box domain. This is a characteristic of E3 ligases that function as one component of a SCF (Skp1, Cullin, F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex (1Bodine S.C. Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K.M. Nunez L.

FBXO32 lacks leucine-rich repeats or WD40 repeats but it does contain a class II PDZ domain (2Gomes M.D. Lecker S.H. Jagoe R.T. Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Atrogin-1, a muscle-specific F-box protein highly expressed during muscle atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), which interacts with specific sequences at the carboxyl terminus of the target proteins (3Ponting C.P. Phillips C.

Peptide-surface association: the case of PDZ and PTB domains.Cell. 1996; 86: 341-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, FBXO32 also contains two nuclear localization signals, which suggests that it may target transcription factors or other nuclear proteins for ubiquitination (5Julie L.C. Sabrina B.P. Marie-Pierre L. Leibovitch S.A. Identification of essential sequences for cellular localization in the muscle-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase MAFbx/Atrogin 1.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As an ubiquitin E3 ligase, FBXO32 has been shown to target several proteins for proteasomal degradation (6Lagirand-Cantaloube J. Offner N. Csibi A. Leibovitch M.P. Batonnet-Pichon S. Tintignac L.A. Segura C.T. Leibovitch S.A.

The two most widely known targets of FBXO32 in skeletal muscle are the initiation factor, eIF3-f, and the myogenic regulatory factor, MyoD. In addition to targeting the proteins mediating FBXO32 function in muscle atrophy, FBXO32 also targets MKPK phosphatase-1 for proteasomal degradation and is probably involved in ischemia/reperfusion-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (8Xie P. Guo S. Fan Y. Zhang H. Gu D. Li H.

The expression level of FBXO32 is closely correlated with the methylation status of the FBXO32 promoter in ovarian cancer cell lines (9Chou J.L. Su H.Y. Chen L.Y. Liao Y.P. Hartman-Frey C. Lai Y.H. Yang H.W. Deatherage D.E. Kuo C.T. Huang Y.W. Yan P.S. Hsiao S.H. Tai C.K. Lin H.J.L. Davuluri R.V. Chao T.K. Nephew K.P. Huang T.H.M. Lai H.C. Chan M.W.Y.

Invest. 2010; 90: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Restoration of FBXO32 in ovarian cancer cells inhibits colony formation in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Moreover, patients with higher FBXO32 promoter methylation tend to have shorter progression-free survival. This suggests a tumor-suppressive role of FBXO32 (9Chou J.L. Su H.Y. Chen L.Y. Liao Y.P. Hartman-Frey C. Lai Y.H. Yang H.W. Deatherage D.E. Kuo C.T. Huang Y.W. Yan P.S. Hsiao S.H. Tai C.K. Lin H.J.L. Davuluri R.V. Chao T.K. Nephew K.P. Huang T.H.M. Lai H.C. Chan M.W.Y.

Invest. 2010; 90: 414-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, the FBXO32 expression is also decreased in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (10Guo W. Zhang M. Shen S. Guo Y. Kuang G. Yang Z. Dong Z. Aberrant methylation and decreased expression of the TGF-β/Smad target gene FBXO32 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.Cancer. 2014; 120: 2412-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). EZH2 supports the survival of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma by repressing FBXO32 (11Ciarapica R. De Salvo M. Carcarino E. Bracaglia G. Adesso L. Leoncini P.P. Dall'Agnese A. Walters Z.S. Verginelli F.

Sandesara P.B. Senf S.M. Judge A.R.

Therefore, the role of FBXO32 in tumorigenesis is still unclear, and the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. c-Myc is a short-lived protein and a classic oncogene regulated at multiple steps. One of the most prominent mechanisms for c-Myc degradation in cells is through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (14Farrell A.S. Sears R.C. MYC degradation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As a component of the RING finger domain, ubiquitin ligase complex (15Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N. Okumura F. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), Fbw7 is the best studied SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase for mediating c-Myc degradation. The FBW7 recognizes phosphorylated c-Myc at Thr-58, which is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (Gsk3) (15Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N. Okumura F.

Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Another RING finger E3 ligase, Skp2, recognizes a conserved sequence element in the amino terminus of c-Myc (MBII) as well as the HLH-LZ motifs (amino acids 367–439). It promotes its polyubiquitination and degradation, resulting in the enhancement of c-Myc transcriptional activity (17Kim S.Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1189-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The third RING finger E3 ligase, β-TrCP, binds to the amino terminus of c-Myc and uses the UbcH5 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) to form heterotypic polyubiquitin chains on c-Myc. This enhances c-Myc stability (19Popov N. Schülein C. Jaenicke L.A. Eilers M. Ubiquitylation of the amino terminus of Myc by SCF(β-TrCP) antagonizes SCF(Fbw7)-mediated turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Importantly, the expression pattern of FBXO32 is inversely correlated with c-Myc expression during starvation treatment (2Gomes M.D. Lecker S.H. Jagoe R.T. Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Atrogin-1, a muscle-specific F-box protein highly expressed during muscle atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Serum stimulation induces expression of c-Myc immediately (20Persson H. Gray H.E. Godeau F. Braunhut S. Bellvé A.R.

In contrast, IGF-1 inhibits the transcription of FBXO32 through the PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway and blocks dexamethasone-induced atrophy (24Stitt T.N. Drujan D. Clarke B.A. Panaro F. Timofeyva Y.

Jagoe R.T. Navon A. Goldberg A.L. Atrogin-1, a muscle-specific F-box protein highly expressed during muscle atrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of FOXO3a leads to a considerable reduction in c-Myc (25Ferber E.C. Peck B. Delpuech O. Bell G.P. East P. Schulze A. FOXO3a regulates reactive oxygen metabolism by inhibiting mitochondrial gene expression.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 968-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Delpuech O. Griffiths B.

Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 4917-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Given that FBXO32 is a direct target of FOXO3a (27Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Foxo transcription factors induce the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligase atrogin-1 and cause skeletal muscle atrophy.Cell. 2004; 117: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2195) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether FBXO32 participates in the degradation of c-Myc. In this study, we identify c-Myc as a substrate of FBXO32 E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXO32 targets c-Myc for ubiquitination and degradation through the proteasome pathway. Mutation of the lysine 326 in c-Myc reduces c-Myc ubiquitination and prevents c-Myc degradation induced by FBXO32. Moreover, overexpression of FBXO32 suppresses c-Myc activity and inhibits cell growth. In addition, we reveal that FBXO32 is a direct downstream target of c-Myc. HEK293T, HCT116, A673, and SKOV3 cells were originally obtained from ATCC. HEK293T, HCT116, and A673 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; HyClone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, whereas SKOV3 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium. VigoFect (Vigorous Biotech, Beijing) was used for cell transfection following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The original wild-type c-Myc and its domain constructs were kindly provided by Stephen Hann. HA-tagged c-Myc(P57S) and c-Myc(T58A) were kindly provided by Scott Lowe. The original Gadd45α promoter luciferase reporter was provided by Linda Penn. The pGL3-E2F2 promoter luciferase reporter was constructed by PCR amplification (28Sears R. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Identification of positively and negatively acting elements regulating expression of the E2F2 gene in response to cell growth signals.Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 5227-5235Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). pGL3-E2F2-mut promoter luciferase reporter was constructed by mutating three E-boxes in the promoter (the sequence information will be provided upon requested). The FBXO32 coding sequence was amplified from cDNA derived from 293T cell total RNA by PCR with the primers 5′-CCCGAATTCGGATGCCATTCCTCGGGCAGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCGGTACCTCAGAACTTGAACAAGTTGATAAAG-3′ (reverse) and then subcloned into pCMV-HA vector (Clontech). Phage-CMV-MCS-IZsGreen was used as a retroviral expression vector. FBXO32-WT, FBXO32-ΔF-box, c-Myc-WT, and c-Myc-K326R were subcloned into phage-CMV-MCS-IZsGreen and confirmed by sequencing. The FBXO32 promoter (positions −452 to +24) for its luciferase reporter construct was amplified from total DNA extracted from 293T cells by PCR with the primers 5′-CCCCTCGAGGGCTGATCTGGCTGCGGAGGTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGCGTTGCAGGCTCCGGGAGTGC-3′ (reverse). The promoter was then subcloned into pGL4.10 vector (Promega). For RNA interference experiments, pSuper and lentivirus vector LentiLox3.7 were used to make short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. The target sequence for both pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-1 and pll3.7-FBXO32-shRNA-1 was 5′-GTCACATCCTTTCCTGGAA-3′. The target sequence for both pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-2 and pll3.7-FBXO32-shRNA-2 was 5′-GGAAGAAGATGTATTTCAA-3′. pSuper-c-Myc-shRNA-1 and pSuper-c-Myc-shRNA-2 were constructed using the following targeting sequences: 5′- CTATGACCTCGACTACGAC-3′ (pSuper-c-Myc-shRNA-1) and 5′-GACGAGAACAGTTGAAACA-3′ (pSuper-c-Myc-shRNA-2), respectively. The target sequence for pll3.7-c-Myc-shRNA was 5′-GCCATAATGTAAACTGCCT-3′, which targets 5′-UTR of human c-Myc. For rescue experiments, the cDNA sequence of FBXO32 corresponding to the target sequence of FBXO32-shRNA-2, 5′-GGAAGAAGATGTATTTCAA-3′ (the mutated sites are underlined), was mutated to 5′-GGAAAAAAATGTACTTTAA-3′ (the mutated sites are underlined). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-FBXO32 antibody (7721-1, Epitomics; PAB15627, Abnovo), anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; A0309, ABclonal; D84C12, Cell Signaling), anti-E2F2 antibody (6848-1, Epitomics), anti-FLAG antibody (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-HA antibody (Covance), anti-GAPDH antibody (SC-47724, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-tubulin antibody (EPR1333, Epitomics), and anti-GFP antibody (AG281-1, Beyotime). The reagents used were as follows: MG132 (Calbiochem) and cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA was extracted from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) following the manufacturer's instructions. Human FBXO32, E2F2, and Gadd45α cDNA were amplified with the following primer sequence: FBXO32, 5′-AAGTCTGTGCTGGTCGGGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGTGAAGGTGAGGCCTTTGAAG-3′ (reverse); E2F2, 5′-GGCCAAGAACAACATCCAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTCCTCAGTCAGGTGCTTG-3′ (reverse); Gadd45α, 5′-ATGACTTTGGAGGAATTCTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATTGATCCATGTAGCGACTT-3′ (reverse). 18S rRNA was used as an internal control. The primers for 18S rRNA were 5′-TCAACTTCGATGGTAGTCGCCGT-3′, and 5′-TCCTTGGATGTGGTAGCCGTTCT-3′. HEK293T or HCT116 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmids by VigoFect (Vigorous Biotech, Beijing). The pRL-SV40 luciferase reporter (Promega) was included in all transfections for normalization. Luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Data were normalized to Renilla luciferase. Data are reported as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (unpaired Student's t test) (GraphPad Software Inc.). The stable transfected SKOV3 cells via lentivirus infection were seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 103 cells/well and cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 14 days. The colonies were fixed and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 50% methanol for 30 min. Dishes were rinsed with water and left for drying at room temperature. Colonies were photographed with a stereomicroscope and counted by ImageJ software. Only the colonies containing more than 50 cells were set for counting. Data are reported as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (unpaired Student's t test) (GraphPad Software Inc.). ChIP assays were performed in HCT116 cells following the protocol described previously (29Feng X. Liu X. Zhang W. Xiao W. p53 directly suppresses BNIP3 expression to protect against hypoxia-induced cell death.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3397-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The primers for amplifying FBXO32 promoter were 5′-AGCACCGCTTCAAGTTTCCACCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCAGTAGCTGCCGCAGTATTTATCCC-3′ (reverse); the primers for amplifying β-actin promoter were 5′-CAGGGCGTGATGGTGGGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′ (reverse). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids using Vigofect. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were collected, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Novagen) and then examined by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. The ubiquitin mutants have been described previously (30Wang J. Zhang W. Ji W. Liu X. Ouyang G. Xiao W. The von Hippel-Lindau protein suppresses androgen receptor activity.Mol. Endocrinol. 2014; 28: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Lentiviruses for gene overexpression were generated by transfecting HEK293T cells with combinations of transducing vector and two packaging vectors, PSPAX2 and pMD2.G. For lentiviral shRNA production, transducing vector was co-transfected with three packaging vectors, PMDLg/pRRE, VSVG, and RSV-Rev, in HEK293T cells. After transfection for 6 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 10% FBS. 48 h later, the medium containing the lentivirus particles was harvested, filtered, and transduced into target cells or frozen at −70 °C for subsequent using. Polybrene (8 μg/ml) was added to the medium for improving infection efficiency. For Western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation, the experimental procedures have been described previously (31Chen Z. Liu X. Mei Z. Wang Z. Xiao W.

Biol. 2014; 34: 1085-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Anti-HA antibody and anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads were purchased from GE Healthcare. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Bind resin was purchased from Novogen. For endogenous immunoprecipitation, the mouse leg muscle was used for extracting protein. The Fuji Film LAS4000 miniluminescent image analyzer system was used to photograph the blots. Multi Gauge version 3.0 was used for quantifying the protein levels based on the band density obtained in Western blot analysis. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate; the statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (unpaired Student's t tests). To study the relationship between FBXO32 and c-Myc, we first transfected HEK293T cells with an equal amount of HA-c-Myc and increasing amounts of HA-FBXO32. Ectopic expression of FBXO32 degraded c-Myc in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1A). In contrast, knockdown of endogenous FBXO32 by transiently transfected pSuper-shRNA-1 or pSuper-shRNA-2 in HCT116 cells caused endogenous c-Myc to increase (first line from the top to the bottom in the left panel of Fig. 1B). Consistently, E2F2, a well defined downstream target of c-Myc, also increased (second line from the top to the bottom in the left panel of Fig. 1B). The efficiency of pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-1- or pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-2-mediated FBXO32 knockdown was confirmed (third line from the top to the bottom in the left panel of Fig. 1B). To verify the specificity of FBXO32-shRNA-2-mediated FBXO32 knockdown, we performed a rescue experiment. As shown in Fig. 1C, overexpression of FBXO32-shRNA-2-resistant FBXO32 in HCT116 cells neutralized the effect of FBXO32-shRNA-2-mediated c-Myc up-regulation. To determine whether FBXO32-mediated c-Myc reduction was due to FBXO32-induced c-Myc instability, we added the new protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) 2The abbreviations used are: CHXcycloheximideK8RK51R/K52R/K126R/K157R/K289R/K371R/K389R/K412R multiple mutant. and examined the protein levels at different time points. Without ectopically expressed FBXO32, the overexpressed c-Myc gradually degraded (left panel in Fig. 1D). However, co-expression of wild-type FBXO32 caused c-Myc to degrade more rapidly (middle panel in Fig. 1D). In contrast, co-expression of the F-box domain-deleted mutant of FBXO32 obviously prolonged the half-life of c-Myc (right panel in Fig. 1D). It appears that the mutant, FBXO32-ΔF-box, exhibits the dominant negative form activity in mediating c-Myc degradation. The protein levels of c-Myc were further quantified (Fig. 1D). To further evaluate the data, we knocked down endogenous FBXO32 by transiently transfected pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-1 and pSuper-FBXO32-shRNA-1 in HCT116 cells and examined the protein level at different time points in the presence of CHX (50 μg/ml). Versus the control, which was transiently transfected with pSuper-GFP-shRNA (left panel in Fig. 1E), knockdown of FBXO32 prolonged the half-life of endogenous c-Myc (middle and right panels in Fig. 1E). This is in contrast to what was seen in overexpression of FBXO32 (Fig. 1E). The c-Myc levels were then further quantified (Fig. 1E). cycloheximide K51R/K52R/K126R/K157R/K289R/K371R/K389R/K412R multiple mutant. It is of note that anti-c-Myc antibodies from different companies could detect different expression patterns of endogenous c-Myc. The anti-c-Myc antibody from ABclonal could only detect one obvious band of endogenous c-Myc, but the antibody from Cell Signaling could detect two bands of endogenous c-Myc. Regardless of the number of bands, the tendency of c-Myc expression to be affected by knockdown of FBXO32 remained consistent (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). Taken together, these observations suggest that FBXO32 induces c-Myc degradation and that the F-box domain is required for FBXO32 to mediate c-Myc degradation. It has been reported that FBW7, an F-box E3 ligase, destabilizes c-Myc, but the FBW7 mutant lacking the F-box domain delayed it (15Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H.

Of note, the turnover of c-Myc by FBW7 is largely dependent on the phosphorylation of Thr-58 and Ser-62 in MBI (15Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N.

To determine whether FBXO32 also has functions similar to that of FBW7 on these mutants, we examined the effect of FBXO32 on the c-Myc mutants T58A, S62A, T58A/S62A, and P57S as well as the constitutive phosphorylation mutant S62E. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, co-expression of HA-FBXO32 promotes degradation in all of these mutants. In addition"

The vaginal formulation (VF) gel was previously used in the CAPRISA 004 and VOICE vaginal microbicide Phase 2B trials and the RMP-02/MTN-006 Phase 1 rectal safety study. The reduced glycerin VF (RGVF) gel was used in the MTN-007 Phase 1 rectal microbicide trial and is currently being evaluated in the MTN-017 Phase 2 rectal microbicide trial. A third rectal specific formulation (RF) gel was also evaluated in the CHARM-01 study. Methods Participants received 4 mL of the three TFV gels in a blinded, crossover design: seven daily doses of RGVF, seven daily doses of RF, and six daily doses of placebo followed by one dose of VF, in a randomized sequence. Safety, acceptability, compartmental PK, and explant PD were monitored throughout the trial. Results All three gels were found to be safe and acceptable. RF and RGVF PK were not significantly different. Median mucosal mononuclear cell (MMC) TFV-DP trended toward higher values for RF compared to RGVF (1136 and 320 fmol/106 cells respectively). Use of each gel in vivo was associated with significant inhibition of ex vivo colorectal tissue HIV infection. There was also a significant negative correlation between the tissue levels of TFV, tissue TFV-DP, MMC TFV-DP, rectal fluid TFV, and explant HIV-1 infection. Conclusions All three formulations were found to be safe and acceptable. However, the safety profile of the VF gel was only based on exposure to one dose whereas participants received seven doses of the RGVF and RF gels. There was a trend towards higher tissue MMC levels of TFV-DP associated with use of the RF gel. Use of all gels was associated with significant inhibition of ex vivo tissue HIV infection.

https://openalex.org/W353987122,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway plays a pathogenetic role in tumors and has been associated with adverse outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), a key mediator of Wnt signaling, has been linked to leukemic transformation, and LEF1 mutations have been identified in T-ALL. Here we found LEF1 is highly expressed in 25.0% adult ALL patients and LEF1 high expression was associated with high-risk leukemia factors (high WBC, Philadelphia chromosome positive, complex karyotype), shorter event-free survival (EFS), and high relapse rates in patients with B-ALL. LEF1 high expression is also associated with high mutation rate of Notch1 and JAK1 in T-ALL. We identified 2 novel LEF1 mutations (K86E and P106L) in 4 of 131 patients with ALL, and those patients with high-risk ALL (high WBC, complex karyotype). These results suggest a role for LEF1 mutations in leukemogenesis. We further explored the effect of the mutations on cell proliferation and found both mutations significantly promoted the proliferation of ALL cells. We also observed the effect of LEF1 and its mutations on the transcription of its targets, c-MYC and Cyclin D1. We found LEF1 increased the promoter activity of its targets c-MYC and Cyclin D1, and LEF1 K86E and P106L mutants further significantly enhanced this effect. We also observed that the c-MYC and Cyclin D1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in patients with LEF1 high expression compared with those with low expression. Taken together, our findings indicate high LEF1 expression and mutation are associated with high-risk leukemia and our results also revealed that LEF1 high expression and/or gain-of-function mutations are involved in leukemogenesis of ALL."

Herein, we show that mTOR activity mediates the branch-specific expression of CaMKIIα, favoring one secondary, daughter branch over the other in a single neuron. mTOR inhibition decreased the dendritic levels of CaMKIIα protein and mRNA by shortening its poly(A) tail. Overexpression of the RNA-stabilizing protein HuD increased CaMKIIα protein levels and preserved its selective expression in one daughter branch over the other when mTOR was inhibited. Unexpectedly, deleting the third RNA recognition motif of HuD, the domain that binds the poly(A) tail, eliminated the branch-specific expression of CaMKIIα when mTOR was active. These results provide a model for one molecular mechanism that may underlie the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis where mTOR is the tag, preventing deadenylation of CaMKIIα mRNA, whereas HuD captures and promotes its expression in a branch-specific manner.

In this study we analyzed whether NGT and both splice variants of UGT (UGT1 and UGT2) are able to interact with four different mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferases (Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4B, and Mgat5). Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we found that all examined glycosyltransferases are in the vicinity of these UDP-sugar transporters both at the endogenous level and upon overexpression. This observation was confirmed via the FLIM-FRET approach for both NGT and UGT1 complexes with Mgats. This study reports for the first time close proximity between endogenous nucleotide sugar transporters and glycosyltransferases. We also observed that among all analyzed Mgats, only Mgat4B occurs in close proximity to UGT2, whereas the other three Mgats are more distant from UGT2, and it was only possible to visualize their vicinity using proximity ligation assay.

With this technology, dozens of whole genomes or hundreds of exomes can be sequenced in rather short time, producing huge amounts of data. Complex bioinformatics analyses are required to turn these data into scientific findings. In order to run these analyses fast, automated workflows implemented on high performance computers are state of the art. While providing sufficient compute power and storage to meet the NGS data challenge, high performance computing (HPC) systems require special care when utilized for high throughput processing. This is especially true if the HPC system is shared by different users. Here, stability, robustness and maintainability are as important for automated workflows as speed and throughput. To achieve all of these aims, dedicated solutions have to be developed. In this paper, we present the tricks and twists that we utilized in the implementation of our exome data processing workflow. It may serve as a guideline for other high throughput data analysis projects using a similar infrastructure. The code implementing our solutions is provided in the supporting information files."

By combining genetic, pharmacological, and imaging approaches, we find that group 1 mGluRs directly bind α-actinin-4, an interaction mediated by the Calponin homology region of α-actinin-4 and the cytoplasmic tail of group 1 mGluRs. We show that α-actinin-4 is enriched at excitatory synapses, where it colocalizes with the receptors, and that its expression is necessary to support group 1 mGluR-dependent regulation of dendritic protrusion dynamics. We further demonstrate that α-actinin-4 plays a critical role in promoting protrusion motility and morphogenesis, the latter being a function dependent on the α-actinin-4 carboxyl terminus that mediates Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) binding and show that this interaction is regulated by group 1 mGluRs. Our findings provide molecular insights into effectors governing dendritic spine dynamics and identify novel mechanisms by which metabotropic signaling regulates structural plasticity. The following antibodies were used: goat polyclonal anti-GAPDH (GenScript); chicken polyclonal anti-MAP2 (EnCor Biotech); the rabbit monoclonal antibodies anti-Actn4, anti-Actn1, and anti-mGlu5 (Epitomics); the rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-pan-mGlu1, anti-pan-mGlu5 (Alomone Labs), anti-mGlu5 (GenScript), anti-PSD95 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-Actn4 (Enzo Life Sciences), anti-phospho-ERK1/2(Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-CaMKII(Thr-286/Thr-287), and anti-CaMKII (Cell Signaling Technology); and the mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-MAP2 clone AP20 (Roche Applied Science), anti-actinin clone EA-53 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Actn4 (Abnova), anti-mGlu1a (BD Biosciences), anti-PSD95 clone K28/43 (University of California Davis/National Institutes of Health NeuroMab Facility), and anti-His tag (Aviva Systems Biology).

Antibodies against different actinin isoforms were validated for specificity by Western blot analysis of lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with Actn1-GFP, Actn2-GFP, or Actn4-GFP. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Actn4 (Enzo Life Sciences) and rabbit monoclonal anti-Actn4 (Epitomics) antibodies were used for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Mouse monoclonal anti-Actn4 antibody (Abnova) was used for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation. (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), BAY36-7620 (BAY), and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) were obtained from Tocris/R&D Systems. Human α-actinin-1 fused to GFP developed by the laboratory of Carol Otey was obtained from Addgene. Human α-actinin-2 and human full-length (1–911) and mutant (1–762) α-actinin-4 were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). Wild type full-length cDNA (1–911) encoding human α-actinin-4 and deletion mutants (residues 1–762, 1–516, 1–296, and 296–911) generated by polymerase chain reaction were subcloned in-frame to GST into pGEX4T-2 (GE Healthcare). The rat mGlu1 fragment (residues 841–886) was subcloned in pPROEX HTa. Additional plasmids used were pDsRed-1 (Clontech) and pmaxGFP (Lonza). Individual siRNAs (Accell, Dharmacon) used to knock down rat Actn4 were 5′-UUAUUAACUUACGGAUUUA-3′ (siRNA#1) and 5′-GCCUGGUCGUUAAUGGGUU-3′ (siRNA#2). Both siRNAs selectively down-regulate Actn4. The knockdown efficiency is ≈80% for siRNA#1 (Fig. 4) and ≈ 50% for siRNA#2 (data not shown). SiRNA#1 was used in all experiments involving knockdown, and siRNA#2 was used in the experiments illustrated in Fig. 5G.FIGURE 5Actn4 supports dendritic protrusion dynamics and is required for protrusion remodeling by group 1 mGluRs.

Dissected cerebrum from adult wild-type mice was homogenized on ice in a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 320 mm sucrose (pH 7.4) with protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet and supernatant were equilibrated to 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. For immunoprecipitation, brain lysate was precleared by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to agarose beads (TrueBlot, eBioscience) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Precleared lysate was incubated with primary antibody for 1 h on ice, and immunocomplexes were captured by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-agarose beads for 16 h at 4 °C. Cortical neurons were rinsed with PBS and lysed in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were precleared by incubation with protein G-coupled magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) for 10 min at 4 °C under constant rotation. Precleared lysates were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with primary antibody bound onto magnetic beads according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Western blot analysis and detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was carried out according to standard protocols as described previously (31Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Proteomic analysis reveals novel binding partners of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For pulldown assays with cell lysates, preparation of GST fusion proteins and in vitro binding were carried out as described previously (31Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Proteomic analysis reveals novel binding partners of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 100 pmol of purified recombinant proteins were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads and incubated for ∼16 h at 4 °C with 2 mg of cell lysate, followed by wash with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and elution with denaturing sample buffer. His-tagged proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(D3) induced with 1 mm isopropylthio-galactoside for 1 h at 25 °C were purified by binding to nickel-NTA agarose (Thermo Scientific). For the in vitro binding assay, bound His-tagged proteins were washed extensively with a buffer of 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and equilibrated in binding buffer of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. GST-tagged fusion proteins (250 nm) were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with bound His-tagged proteins in binding buffer. After an extensive wash with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with denaturing sample buffer. HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Cortical and hippocampal neurons were prepared from newborn rat pups and plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.), culture plates. Cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 2 mm GlutaMax, 37 mm uridine and 27 mm 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine. Neurons were transfected by Nucleofection (Lonza) or calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (31Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Proteomic analysis reveals novel binding partners of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For RNAi, siRNAs (1 μm; Accell, Dharmacon) were applied to DIV 7/8 neurons in culture medium and maintained for 4 days. For drug treatment, neurons plated on coverslips or culture dishes were rinsed twice with Krebs buffer (10 mm HEPES, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 11 mm glucose (pH 7.4)), and DHPG was applied for 30 min at 37 °C. For live imaging experiments, neurons on glass bottom dishes were imaged at 37 °C in Neurobasal medium without phenol red supplemented with 2% B27 and bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Cells were selected for imaging on the basis of morphology and GFP expression. Images were acquired every 15 s or 1 min under basal conditions (baseline, 10 min), followed by bath application of drugs in Neurobasal medium. Neurons displaying photodamage at the end of imaging session were not included in the quantification. Antagonists were applied alone for 15 min after baseline and then together with DHPG. Cortical neurons (DIV 12) were incubated for 1 h in the presence of leupeptin (100 μm), and surface proteins were labeled as described previously (31Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Proteomic analysis reveals novel binding partners of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transferred onto ice, rinsed with cold phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and incubated with 10 mm Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min at 8 °C. Cells were washed twice with 50 mm glycine and once with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and lysed in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Biotin-labeled proteins were bound to NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with phosphate buffer with 1% Triton X-100, and eluted in denaturing sample buffer. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and incubated in blocking solution made of 5% normal donkey or goat serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies were applied in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS, appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, including Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 647, aminomethylcoumarin, or Cy3, were applied for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Prolong (Invitrogen). Epifluorescence was imaged with 40× (numerical aperture 1.3) or 60× (numerical aperture 1.35) oil objectives mounted on an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope equipped with a digital charge-coupled device ORCA-R2 camera (Hamamatsu). Confocal images were acquired with 40× or 60× oil objectives mounted on an Olympus Fluoview 500 confocal scanning microscope. For live imaging, images were acquired with a 60× oil objective mounted on a customized Olympus IX70 motorized inverted microscope equipped with a charge-coupled device ORCA-R2 camera. Analysis in fixed cells was performed blind with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Dendritic branches ≥25 μm away from soma were analyzed. For confocal microscopy, stacks of images were acquired with 0.15-μm Z step. Two-dimensional average intensity projection images were used for spine quantification. Morphometric analysis was performed in the DsRed channel with the assumption that the fluorescent protein filled each spine homogeneously. Spine density was calculated as the number of protrusions (<10 μm) divided by branch length. Protrusion length was determined by measuring the distance between the tip and base. Spine head width was measured by drawing a line across the widest region of spines that possessed a distinguishable narrow neck and a wider head. Analysis of Actn4 fluorescence intensity was performed on images of neurons colabeled with MAP2 to visualize somatodendritic compartments. Images were thresholded using the same settings between different conditions. Dendritic segments were drawn manually in the MAP2 channel to define regions of interest for quantification of integrated pixel intensity relative to region of interest area. For live imaging, consecutive 1/min frames were used for quantification. Change in length was determined from the average length of individual protrusions before stimulation (the last 5 min of baseline normalized to the entire baseline) and at 20–25 min post-DHPG. Motility was calculated as the sum of the absolute value of change in spine length from frame to frame divided by number of frames. Turnover was determined as the sum of lost and gained protrusions divided by twice the total number of protrusions (18Cruz-Martín A. Crespo M. Portera-Cailliau C. Glutamate induces the elongation of early dendritic protrusions via mGluRs in wild type mice, but not in fragile X mice.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e32446Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). New protrusions extending ≥0.55 μm from the dendritic shaft were considered “gained.” For display purposes, time-lapse videos were converted to 640 × 480 pixel resolution and captioned using Windows Movie Maker 6. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were carried out in DIV 11/13 hippocampal and cortical neurons voltage-clamped at −60 mV using patch-type pipette electrodes (∼3–4 MΩ) containing 131 mm Cs-gluconate, 8 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); osmolarity, 285–292 mmol/kg. mEPSCs were recorded for 10–15 min at 32 °C in extracellular artificial cerebrospinal solution containing (in mm): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, and 10 glucose. Picrotoxin (100 μm) and tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) were added to this solution to block inhibitory transmission and action potentials, respectively. mEPSCs were filtered at 2.4 kHz, acquired at 5 kHz, and analyzed using a custom-made software written in Igor Pro 4.09A (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). In all cases, the experimenter was blind to conditions during data acquisition and analysis. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test or analysis of variance, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Modifications of the actin cytoskeleton by actin-binding proteins provide the principal driving force underlying rapid morphological changes of dendritic protrusions during development and in response to activity (8Cingolani L.A. Goda Y. Actin in action: the interplay between the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic efficacy.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 344-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We investigated whether group 1 mGluRs function via the actin-binding protein α-actinin-4 (Actn4) to regulate protrusion dynamics. We have reported previously that mGlu1 is present in a complex with Actn4, an association detected in heterologous cells and preserved in the brain (31Francesconi A. Kumari R. Zukin R.S. Proteomic analysis reveals novel binding partners of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1.J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1515-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The GST-Actn4 fusion protein interacts in vitro with myc-mGlu1 expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, we employed in vitro pulldown assays to identify the domains that mediate Actn4 interaction with mGlu1. To this end, we used Actn4 deletion mutants fused to GST and examined their capacity to pull down myc-mGlu1 expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Actn4 is composed of two amino-terminal Calponin ho"

Both the structure and the function of the membrane-spanning part of this pathway are well defined. In contrast, the structure of the pathway that connects the cytoplasm to the membrane-spanning regions is unknown, and functional roles for different parts of the protein forming this pathway have not been described. We used patch clamp recording and substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis to identify positively charged amino acid side chains that attract cytoplasmic Cl− ions to the inner mouth of the pore. Our results indicate that the side chains of Lys-190, Arg-248, Arg-303, Lys-370, Lys-1041, and Arg-1048, located in different intracellular loops of the protein, play important roles in the electrostatic attraction of Cl− ions. Mutation and covalent modification of these residues have charge-dependent effects on the rate of Cl− permeation, demonstrating their functional role in maximization of Cl− flux. Other nearby positively charged side chains were not involved in electrostatic interactions with Cl−. The location of these Cl−-attractive residues suggests that cytoplasmic Cl− ions enter the pore via a lateral portal located between the cytoplasmic extensions to the fourth and sixth transmembrane helices; a secondary, functionally less relevant portal might exist between the extensions to the 10th and 12th transmembrane helices.

https://openalex.org/W1607920429,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been extensively studied due to its essential role in NAD+ biosynthesis in cancer cells and the prospect of developing novel therapeutics. To understand how NAMPT regulates cellular metabolism, we have shown that the treatment with FK866, a specific NAMPT inhibitor, leads to attenuation of glycolysis by blocking the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step (Tan, B., Young, D. A., Lu, Z. H., Wang, T., Meier, T. I., Shepard, R. L., Roth, K., Zhai, Y., Huss, K., Kuo, M. S., Gillig, J., Parthasarathy, S., Burkholder, T. P., Smith, M. C., Geeganage, S., and Zhao, G. (2013) Pharmacological inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), an enzyme essential for NAD+ biosynthesis, in human cancer cells: metabolic basis and potential clinical implications. J. Biol. Chem. 288, 3500–3511). Due to technical limitations, we failed to separate isotopomers of phosphorylated sugars. In this study, we developed an enabling LC-MS methodology. Using this, we confirmed the previous findings and also showed that NAMPT inhibition led to accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate but not glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate as previously thought. To investigate the metabolic basis of the metabolite formation, we carried out biochemical and cellular studies and established the following. First, glucose-labeling studies indicated that fructose 1-phosphate was derived from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde, and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate was derived from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and erythrose via an aldolase reaction. Second, biochemical studies showed that aldolase indeed catalyzed these reactions.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) has been extensively studied due to its essential role in NAD+ biosynthesis in cancer cells and the prospect of developing novel therapeutics. To understand how NAMPT regulates cellular metabolism, we have shown that the treatment with FK866, a specific NAMPT inhibitor, leads to attenuation of glycolysis by blocking the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step (Tan, B., Young, D. A., Lu, Z. H., Wang, T., Meier, T. I., Shepard, R. L., Roth, K., Zhai, Y., Huss, K., Kuo, M. S., Gillig, J., Parthasarathy, S., Burkholder, T. P., Smith, M. C., Geeganage, S., and Zhao, G.

J. Biol. Chem. 288, 3500–3511). Due to technical limitations, we failed to separate isotopomers of phosphorylated sugars. In this study, we developed an enabling LC-MS methodology. Using this, we confirmed the previous findings and also showed that NAMPT inhibition led to accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate but not glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate as previously thought. To investigate the metabolic basis of the metabolite formation, we carried out biochemical and cellular studies and established the following. First, glucose-labeling studies indicated that fructose 1-phosphate was derived from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde, and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate was derived from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and erythrose via an aldolase reaction. Second, biochemical studies showed that aldolase indeed catalyzed these reactions. Third, glyceraldehyde- and erythrose-labeling studies showed increased incorporation of corresponding labels into fructose 1-phosphate and sedoheptulose 1-phosphate in FK866-treated cells.

https://openalex.org/W243731514,"We previously detected and investigated nine altered microRNAs in small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor (SI-NET) tissues at different stages of disease. The aims of this study are to: 1) analyze whether SI-NET tissue microRNAs can be also detected in patient serum samples, 2) investigate a potential somatostatin analogs (SSAs) role on microRNA levels regulation in SSA-treated patient samples and 3) elucidate whether the serum microRNA levels in samples collected in different hospitals are predictable and steady. Our results show that tissue microRNAs are detectable in patient serum samples, and miR-96, -182, -183, -196a and -200a levels are lower in SI-NET untreated patients than in SSA-treated patients at all different stages. Conversely, miR-31, -129-5p, -133a and -215 levels do not show any difference in untreated SI-NET patients and SSA-treated patients at all different stages. Our findings also show that miR-200a exhibits an atypical behavior with high levels in both untreated and SSA-treated patients at liver metastasis stage, and unequivocally never at the earlier stages. Serum samples collected in two hospitals keep alike microRNA level pattern, elucidating that the results are not dependent on samples handling. In conclusion, SI-NET tissue microRNAs are always detectable in untreated and SSA-treated patient serum samples, SSAs play an unknown role in eliciting SSA-treated patients' microRNA levels higher than in untreated patients, and this study enlightens that miR-200a might be involved in the liver metastasis during SI-NET progression."

Large amount of glutamate can overstimulate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), causing neuronal injury and death. Recently, NMDAR has been reported to be found in the lungs. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of memantine, a NMDAR channel blocker, on bleomycin-induced lung injury mice.C57BL/6 mice were intratracheally injected with bleomycin (BLM) to induce lung injury. Mice were randomized to receive saline, memantine (Me), BLM, BLM plus Me. Lungs and BALF were harvested on day 3 or 7 for further evaluation.BLM caused leukocyte infiltration, pulmonary edema and increase in cytokines, and imposed significant oxidative stress (MDA as a marker) in lungs. Memantine significantly mitigated the oxidative stress, lung inflammatory response and acute lung injury caused by BLM. Moreover, activation of NMDAR enhances CD11b expression on neutrophils.Memantine mitigates oxidative stress, lung inflammatory response and acute lung injury in BLM challenged mice."

Kinesin-1 can function as a dimer of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC), which harbor the motor domain, or as a tetramer in combination with two accessory light chains (KLC). To ensure proper cargo distribution, kinesin-1 activity is precisely regulated. Both KLC and KHC subunits bind cargoes or regulatory proteins to engage the motor for movement along microtubules. We previously showed that the scaffolding protein JIP3 interacts directly with KHC in addition to its interaction with KLC and positively regulates dimeric KHC motility. Here we determined the stoichiometry of JIP3-KHC complexes and observed approximately four JIP3 molecules binding per KHC dimer. We then determined whether JIP3 activates tetrameric kinesin-1 motility. Using an in vitro motility assay, we show that JIP3 binding to KLC engages kinesin-1 with microtubules and that JIP3 binding to KHC promotes kinesin-1 motility along microtubules.

https://openalex.org/W307632218,"The potential relationship between cell cycle checkpoint control and tissue regeneration has been indicated. Despite considerable research being focused on the relationship between p21 and myogenesis, p21 function in skeletal muscle regeneration remains unclear. To clarify this, muscle injury model was recreated by intramuscular injection of bupivacaine hydrochloride in the soleus of p21 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice. The mice were sacrificed at 3, 14, and 28 days post-operation. The results of hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunofluorescence of muscle membrane indicated that muscle regeneration was delayed in p21 KO mice. Cyclin D1 mRNA expression and both Ki-67 and PCNA immunohistochemistry suggested that p21 deficiency increased cell cycle and muscle cell proliferation. F4/80 immunohistochemistry also suggested the increase of immune response in p21 KO mice. On the other hand, both the mRNA expression and western blot analysis of MyoD, myogenin, and Pax7 indicated that muscular differentiation was delayed in p21KO mice. Considering these results, we confirmed that muscle injury causes an increase in cell proliferation. However, muscle differentiation in p21 KO mice was inhibited due to the low expression of muscular synthesis genes, leading to a delay in the muscular regeneration. Thus, we conclude that p21 plays an important role in the in vivo healing process in muscular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1936805914,"Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) can exert both anabolic and catabolic effects on the skeleton, potentially through expression of the PTH type1 receptor (PTH1R), which is highly expressed in osteocytes. To determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible, we examined the effects of PTH on osteoblast to osteocyte differentiation using primary osteocytes and the IDG-SW3 murine cell line, which differentiate from osteoblast to osteocyte-like cells in vitro and express GFP under control of the dentin matrix 1 (Dmp1) promoter. PTH treatment resulted in an increase in some osteoblast and early osteocyte markers and a decrease in mature osteocyte marker expression. The gene expression profile of PTH-treated Day 28 IDG-SW3 cells was similar to PTH treated primary osteocytes. PTH treatment induced striking changes in the morphology of the Dmp1-GFP positive cells in IDG-SW3 cultures and primary cells from Dmp1-GFP transgenic mice. The cells changed from a more dendritic to an elongated morphology and showed increased cell motility. E11/gp38 has been shown to be important for cell migration, however, deletion of the E11/gp38/podoplanin gene had no effect on PTH-induced motility. The effects of PTH on motility were reproduced using cAMP, but not with protein kinase A (PKA), exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac), protein kinase C (PKC) or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase (Pi3K) agonists nor were they blocked by their antagonists. However, the effects of PTH were mediated through calcium signaling, specifically through L-type channels normally expressed in osteoblasts but decreased in osteocytes. PTH was shown to increase expression of this channel, but decrease the T-type channel that is normally more highly expressed in osteocytes. Inhibition of L-type calcium channel activity attenuated the effects of PTH on cell morphology and motility but did not prevent the downregulation of mature osteocyte marker expression. Taken together, these results show that PTH induces loss of the mature osteocyte phenotype and promotes the motility of these cells. These two effects are mediated through different mechanisms. The loss of phenotype effect is independent and the cell motility effect is dependent on calcium signaling."

https://openalex.org/W244802423,"A higher body mass index (BMI) appears to be reversely associated with mortality in dialysis patients. Moreover, although women have better survival in chronic kidney disease (CKD), this survival advantage is cancelled in dialysis. The association between BMI and mortality and the gender difference remain controversial in advanced CKD.This study enrolled 3,320 patients (1,938 men and 1,382 women) from southern Taiwan who had CKD stages 3-5 with a BMI of 15.0-35.0 kg/m2.During a median 2.9-year follow-up, there were 328 (16.9%) all-cause mortality and 319 (16.5%) cardiovascular (CV) events and death in male patients, 213 (15.4%) all-cause mortality and 224 (16.2%) CV events and death in female patients. Compared with the reference BMI of 27.6-30.0 kg/m2 in an adjusted Cox model, lower-BMI groups in men, BMI 15.0-20.0 kg/m2 and 20.1-22.5 kg/m2, were associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality: hazard ratios (HRs) 3.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97-5.18) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.29-3.14), respectively. Higher-BMI group in men, BMI 30.1-35.0 kg/m2, was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality: HR 1.72 (95% CI, 1.02-2.96). Likewise, lower- and higher-BMI groups in men were associated with a higher risk of CV events and death. In women, these associations between BMI and poor outcomes were not observed.In advanced CKD, there was a reverse J-shaped association between BMI and all-cause mortality, and a U-shaped association between BMI and CV outcomes in men. Neutral associations between BMI and poor outcomes were detected in women. Gender could modify the effect of BMI on mortality in patients with CKD."
https://openalex.org/W1873246221,"Most studies have reported barriers to guideline usage mainly from doctors' perspective; few have reported the perspective of other stakeholders. This study aimed to determine the views and barriers to adherence of a national clinical practice guideline (CPG) on management of hypertension from the perspectives of policymakers, doctors and allied healthcare professionals.This study used a qualitative approach with purposive sampling. Seven in depth interviews and six focus group discussions were conducted with 35 healthcare professionals (policy makers, doctors, pharmacists and nurses) at a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between February and June 2013. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked. Thematic approach was used to analyse the data.Two main themes and three sub-themes emerged from this study. The main themes were (1) variation in the use of CPG and (2) barriers to adherence to CPG. The three sub-themes for barriers were issues inherent to the CPG, systems and policy that is not supportive of CPG use, and attitudes and behaviour of stakeholders. The main users of the CPG were the primary care doctors. Pharmacists only partially use the guidelines, while nurses and policy makers were not using the CPG at all. Participants had suggested few strategies to improve usage and adherence to CPG. First, update the CPG regularly and keep its content simple with specific sections for allied health workers. Second, use technology to facilitate CPG accessibility and provide protected time for implementation of CPG recommendations. Third, incorporate local CPG in professional training, link CPG adherence to key performance indicators and provide incentives for its use.Barriers to the use of CPG hypertension management span across all stakeholders. The development and implementation of CPG focused mainly on doctors with lack of involvement of other healthcare stakeholders. Guidelines should be made simple, current, reliable, accessible, inclusive of all stakeholders and with good policy support."
https://openalex.org/W1481437401,"Both socioeconomic position (SEP) and type 2 diabetes have previously been found to be associated with mortality; however, little is known about the association between SEP, type 2 diabetes and long-term mortality when comorbidity is taken into account.We conducted a population-based cohort study of all Danish citizens aged 40-69 years with no history of diabetes during 2001-2006 (N=2,330,206). The cohort was identified using nationwide registers, and it was followed for up to 11 years (mean follow-up was 9.5 years (SD: 2.6)). We estimated the age-standardised mortality rate (MR) and performed Poisson regression to estimate the mortality-rate-ratio (MRR) by educational level, income and cohabiting status among people with and without type 2 diabetes.We followed 2,330,206 people for 22,971,026 person-years at risk and identified 139,681 individuals with type 2 diabetes. In total, 195,661 people died during the study period; 19,959 of these had type 2 diabetes. The age-standardised MR increased with decreasing SEP both for people with and without diabetes. Type 2 diabetes and SEP both had a strong impact on the overall mortality; the combined effect of type 2 diabetes and SEP on mortality was additive rather than multiplicative. Compared to women without diabetes and in the highest income quintile, the MRR's were 2.8 (95%CI 2.6, 3.0) higher for women with type 2 diabetes in the lowest income quintile, while diabetes alone increased the risk of mortality 2.0 (95%CI 1.9, 2.2) times and being in the lowest income quintile without diabetes 1.8 (95%CI 1.7,1.9) times after adjusting for comorbidity. For men, the MRR's were 2.7 (95%CI 2.5,2.9), 1.9 (95%CI 1.8,2.0) and 1.8 (95%CI 1.8,1.9), respectively.Both Type 2 diabetes and SEP were associated with the overall mortality. The relation between type 2 diabetes, SEP, and all-cause mortality was only partly explained by comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W209353644,"Natural grassland productivity, which is based on an individual plant's aboveground biomass (AB) and its interaction with herbivores, can obviously affect terrestrial ecosystem services and the grassland's agricultural production. As plant traits have been linked to both AB and ecosystem success, they may provide a useful approach to understand the changes in individual plants and grassland productivity in response to grazing on a generic level. Unfortunately, the current lack of studies on how plant traits affect AB affected by herbivores leaves a major gap in our understanding of the mechanism of grassland productivity decline. This study, therefore, aims to analyze the paths of overgrazing-induced decline in the individual AB of Leymus chinensis (the dominant species of meadow-steppe grassland in northern China) on a plant functional trait scale. Using a paired-sampling approach, we compared the differences in the functional traits of L. chinensis in long-term grazing-excluded and experimental grazing grassland plots over a continuous period of approximately 20 years (located in meadow steppe lands in Hailar, Inner Mongolia, China). We found a highly significant decline in the individual height and biomass (leaf, stem, and the whole plant) of L. chinensis as a result of overgrazing. Biomass allocation and leaf mass per unit area were significantly affected by the variation in individual size. Grazing clearly enhanced the sensitivity of the leaf-to-stem biomass ratio in response to variation in individual size. Moreover, using a method of standardized major axis estimation, we found that the biomass in the leaves, stems, and the plant as a whole had highly significant allometric scaling with various functional traits. Also, the slopes of the allometric equations of these relationships were significantly altered by grazing. Therefore, a clear implication of this is that grazing promotes an asymmetrical response of different plant functional traits to variation in individual plant size, which influences biomass indirectly. Furthermore, we detected paths of individual AB decline in L. chinensis induced by grazing by fitting to a structural equation model. These results indicate that grazing causes AB decline primarily through a 'bottom-up' effect on plant height and stem traits. However, leaf traits, via the process of allometric scaling, affect plant AB indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W385420327,"Rapeseed meal and waste molasses are two important agro-industrial by-products which are produced in large quantities. In this study, solid state fermentation and fungal autolysis were performed to produce rapeseed meal hydrolysate (RMH) using fungal strains of Aspergillus oryzae, Penicillium oxalicum and Neurospora crassa. The hydrolysate was used as fermentation feedstock for heterotrophic growth of microalga Crypthecodinium cohnii that produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The addition of waste molasses as a supplementary carbon source greatly increased the biomass and DHA yield. In the batch fermentations using media composed of diluted RMH (7%) and 1-9% waste molasses, the highest biomass concentration and DHA yield reached 3.43 g/L and 8.72 mg/L, respectively. The algal biomass produced from RMH and molasses medium also had a high percentage of DHA (22-34%) in total fatty acids similar to that of commercial algal biomass. RMH was shown to be rich in nitrogen supply comparable to the commercial nitrogen feedstock like yeast extract. Using RMH as sole nitrogen source, waste molasses excelled other carbon sources and produced the highest concentration of biomass. This study suggests that DHA production of the marine dinoflagellate C. cohnii could be greatly improved by concomitantly using the cheap by-products rapeseed meal hydrolysate and molasses as alternative feedstock."

This extensive set of molecular dynamics trajectories captures the active-to-inactive transition that had remained elusive for other CBDs, and it provides unprecedented insight on the role of IR dynamics in HCN autoinhibition and its release by cAMP. Specifically, the IR tetramerization domain becomes more flexible in the monomeric states, removing steric clashes that the apo-CDB structure would otherwise impose. Furthermore, the simulations reveal that the active/inactive structural transition for the apo-monomeric CBD occurs through a manifold of pathways that are more divergent than previously anticipated.

The study proposed a model of HCN4 allostery in which the apo-state CBD conformation destabilizes the tetramer through steric clashes with the TD, arising from the incompatibility of the apo-state CBD conformation with the tight packing imposed by the tetramer assembly (17Akimoto M. Zhang Z. Boulton S. Selvaratnam R. VanSchouwen B. Gloyd M. Accili E.A. Lange O.F. Melacini G.

Chem. 2014; 289: 22205-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the CBD/TD steric clashes are released through an increase in TD structural dynamics occurring upon dissociation of the tetramer (17Akimoto M. Zhang Z. Boulton S. Selvaratnam R. VanSchouwen B. Gloyd M. Accili E.A. Lange O.F. Melacini G.

Chem. 2014; 289: 22205-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This hypothetical dynamics-based model provides a simple and effective mechanism to explain how cAMP controls IR tetramerization and contributes to ion channel gating. Nevertheless, only limited information is currently available on the TD dynamics and on the inactive/active transition within the CBD, even though such attributes play a critical role in the proposed model. Monomer TD dynamics are not easily experimentally assessed in the currently available HCN IR monomer constructs, because the αA′–αB′ helices were deleted to stabilize the monomeric state, and the αC′–αD′ helices are possibly affected by the construct's N-terminal truncation as well as by line broadening in the NMR spectra (17Akimoto M. Zhang Z. Boulton S. Selvaratnam R. VanSchouwen B. Gloyd M. Accili E.A. Lange O.F. Melacini G.

Chem. 2014; 289: 22205-22220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the cAMP-bound and apo CBD structures of the HCN4 IR were experimentally determined, providing the start and end points of the active/inactive transition, the pathways and structural variations that occur between these structures have eluded experimental analysis so far. Here, we examine the structural dynamics of the HCN4 intracellular region through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent. Multiple MD trajectories were simulated for each of the four states of the thermodynamic cycle describing the coupling between cAMP binding and tetramerization of the HCN4 intracellular region (i.e. the apo-monomer or inactive state, the apo-tetramer, the holo-monomer, and the holo-tetramer or active state; Fig. 1c), resulting in a total of 1.2 μs of simulated trajectory time (Table 1). The comparative analysis of these four sets of MD simulations provides unprecedented opportunities to dissect the distinct contributions of cAMP binding and tetramerization to the structural dynamics of the HCN IR and its domains (i.e. TD and CBD). In addition, we show that our MD simulations capture the active-to-inactive CBD conformational transition, which occurs in the sub-microsecond time scale for the apo-monomeric HCN IR, but had remained elusive for other eukaryotic CBDs (27VanSchouwen B. Selvaratnam R. Fogolari F. Melacini G. Role of dynamics in the autoinhibition and activation of the exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP (EPAC).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42655-42669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results on HCN reveal that CBDs sample a manifold of active/inactive pathways that are significantly more divergent than previously anticipated. The occurrence of the active-to-inactive conversion in our MD trajectories is also critical to probe the TD dynamics in the inactive form of the auto-inhibitory apo-monomer HCN IR. The MD simulations were validated and complemented by experimental NMR and CD data and reveal that dynamics play a pivotal role in the allosteric coupling between cAMP binding to the CBD and self-association of the TD.TABLE 1Summary of the MD simulations performed for the HCN4 IRSimulated IR stateaThe initial structures for all states were obtained from the x-ray crystal structure of the cAMP-bound intracellular region of human HCN4 (PDB code 3OTF).No. of HCN4 IR protomersContains bound cAMP (yes/no)?Simulation length per replicateNo. of simulation replicates executedNo. of CPUs usednsApo-monomer1No100.0364Apo-tetramer4No100.0364Holo-monomer1Yes100.0364Holo-tetramer4Yes100.0364a The initial structures for all states were obtained from the x-ray crystal structure of the cAMP-bound intracellular region of human HCN4 (PDB code 3OTF). Open table in a new tab Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for a protein construct spanning residues 521–717 of the intracellular region of human HCN4 (referred to herein as “HCN4 IR”), which contains the full TD and CBD regions of the HCN4 intracellular region (Fig. 1b). Although the intact HCN4 IR construct also contains an additional segment C-terminal to the CBD (a segment absent from the x-ray structure), previous functional data suggest that deletion of this C-terminal segment has a negligible effect on the function of the intact HCN protein (28Wainger B.J.

Initial structures for the simulations of all four states in the thermodynamic cycle of Fig. 1c were constructed based on the x-ray crystal structure of the cAMP-bound intracellular region (PDB code 3OTF) (5Xu X.

Hence, the simulations for the apo-monomer HCN IR state were initiated from a nonequilibrium state, i.e. the active HCN IR protomer conformation. Details about the preparation of the initial structures as well as the MD simulation protocols, analyses, and validation by experimental data are described below. The HCN4 IR construct spanning residues 521–717 of the HCN4 intracellular region was used for all MD simulations.

Protein structure coordinate and parameter files with hydrogen atoms for the HCN4 IR structures were constructed using the “Psfgen” module of VMD 1.8.6 (36Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar). Parameters for cAMP were constructed from the parameters for the adenine ribonucleotide (“ADE” in the CHARMM force field) by applying the force field's intrinsic “CY35” patch function (32MacKerell Jr., A.D.

To mimic a pH of 7.0, hydrogen atoms were added such that all His side chains were in their un-ionized τ-state, and the N/C termini and all Asp, Glu, Arg and Lys side chains were in their ionized states. The structures were then immersed in a cubic box of TIP3P water molecules (with box dimensions of 90 Å for monomers or 120 Å for tetramers) using the Solvate module of VMD 1.8.6 (36Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar), such that there was a minimum distance of 12 Å between the protein and the edge of the solvent box. Salt ions (Na+ and Cl−) were added to the solvent box using the Autoionize module of VMD 1.8.6 (36Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38802) Google Scholar), such that the system was neutralized and the number of ions corresponded to a NaCl concentration of 50 mm. Initial energy minimizations were performed using the conjugate gradient algorithm of NAMD. Minimization was performed for 5000 steps with harmonic position restraints on the protein backbone (force constant of 300.0 kcal/mol·Å2), followed by an additional 2000 steps without restraints. During minimization, a cutoff of 15 Å was utilized for all nonbonded energy calculations. Electrostatic interactions beyond the cutoff distance were computed using the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm (37Darden T. York D. Pederson L. Particle mesh Ewald: an N·log(N) method for Ewald sums in large systems.J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20978) Google Scholar), with a tolerance of 10−6 and a maximum grid spacing of 1.0 Å. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed under cubic periodic boundary conditions, beginning from the energy-minimized initial structures. A time step of 1.0 fs was implemented throughout the simulations. All water molecules were constrained to their equilibrium geometries using the SETTLE algorithm (38Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. Settle: an analytical version of the SHAKE and RATTLE algorithm for rigid water models.J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (5231) Google Scholar), and all covalent bonds to hydrogen were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm (39Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J. Numerical algorithms of the Cartesian equations of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of n-alkanes.J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (16982) Google Scholar). A cutoff of 12 Å with Particle Mesh Ewald implementation was utilized for nonbonded energy calculations during the simulations. Short range nonbonded and long range electrostatic interactions were evaluated every 2.0 and 4.0 fs, respectively, using the RESPA multiple time step integrator (40Tuckerman M. Berne B.J. Martyna G.J. Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics.J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 97: 1990-2001Crossref Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). All minimizations and simulations were executed on a 2.83-GHz octuple-core Xeon cluster, using 64 CPUs per run. The structures were heated linearly from 0 to 307 K over 200 ps at a constant volume, using the velocity reassignment protocol of NAMD. The heated structures were then simulated at 307 K and constant volume (NVE ensemble) for another 1.0 ns, to allow a period of temperature equilibration prior to introducing pressure regulation. Next, the structures were simulated at a constant temperature and pressure (NPT ensemble) for 1.0 ns, to allow a period of temperature and pressure equilibration prior to the NPT production run. A constant temperature of 307 K was maintained using the Langevin dynamics algorithm (41Izaguirre J.A. Catarello D.P. Wozniak J.M. Skeel R.D. Langevin stabilization of molecular dynamics.J. Chem.

Microarray analysis revealed differential gene expression between untreated naïve UCMSC and those co-cultured with species-matched breast carcinoma cells. The analyses screened 17 differentially expressed genes that are commonly detected in both human and rat UCMSC. The comparison between the two sets of gene expression profiles identified two tumor suppressor genes, adipose-differentiation related protein (ADRP) and follistatin (FST), that were specifically up-regulated in rat UCMSC, but down-regulated in human UCMSC when they were co-cultured with the corresponding species’ breast carcinoma cells. Over-expression of FST, but not ADRP, in human UCMSC enhanced their ability to suppress the growth of MDA-231 cells. The growth of MDA-231 cells was also significantly lower when they were cultured in medium conditioned with FST, but not ADRP over-expressing human UCMSC. In the breast carcinoma lung metastasis model generated with MDA-231 cells, systemic treatment with FST-over-expressing human UCMSC significantly attenuated the tumor burden. These results suggest that FST may play an important role in exhibiting stronger tumoricidal ability in rat UCMSC than human UCMSC and also implies that human UCMSC can be transformed into stronger tumoricidal cells by enhancing tumor suppressor gene expression."

However, its expression and function in mice remain undefined due to the poor reactivity of conventional anti-sLex monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with mouse tissues. Here, we developed novel anti-sLex mAbs, termed F1 and F2, which react well with both human and mouse sLex, by immunizing fucosyltransferase (FucT)-IV and FucT-VII doubly deficient mice with 6-sulfo-sLex-expressing cells transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase. F1 and F2 specifically bound both the N-acetyl and the N-glycolyl forms of sLex as well as 6-sulfo-sLex, a major ligand for L-selectin expressed in high endothelial venules, and efficiently blocked physiological lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes in mice. Importantly, both of the mAbs inhibited contact hypersensitivity responses not only when administered in the L-selectin-dependent sensitization phase but also when administered in the elicitation phase in mice. When administered in the latter phase, F1 and F2 efficiently blocked rolling of mouse leukocytes along blood vessels expressing P- and E-selectin in the auricular skin in vivo. Consistent with these findings, the mAbs blocked P- and E-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling in a flow chamber assay. Taken together, these results indicate that novel anti-sLex mAbs reactive with both human and mouse tissues, with the blocking ability against leukocyte trafficking mediated by all three selectins, have been established. These mAbs should be useful in determining the role of sLex antigen under physiological and pathological conditions.

Here, we investigated c-Abl regulation of the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), an important regulator of p53-dependent apoptosis. c-Abl phosphorylated HIPK2 at several sites, and phosphorylation by c-Abl protected HIPK2 from degradation mediated by the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah-1. c-Abl and HIPK2 synergized in activating p53 on apoptotic promoters in a reporter assay, and c-Abl was required for endogenous HIPK2 accumulation and phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 in response to DNA damage by γ- and UV radiation. Accumulation of HIPK2 in nuclear speckles and association with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in response to DNA damage were also dependent on c-Abl activity. At high cell density, the Hippo pathway inhibits DNA damage-induced c-Abl activation. Under this condition, DNA damage-induced HIPK2 accumulation, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46, and apoptosis were attenuated.

https://openalex.org/W959929232,"Based on a two-way pseudo-testcross strategy, high density and complete coverage linkage maps were constructed for the maternal and paternal parents of an intraspecific F2 pedigree of Populus deltoides. A total of 1,107 testcross markers were obtained, and the mapping population consisted of 376 progeny. Among these markers, 597 were from the mother, and were assigned into 19 linkage groups, spanning a total genetic distance of 1,940.3 cM. The remaining 519 markers were from the father, and were also were mapped into 19 linkage groups, covering 2,496.3 cM. The genome coverage of both maps was estimated as greater than 99.9% at 20 cM per marker, and the numbers of linkage groups of both maps were in accordance with the 19 haploid chromosomes in Populus. Marker segregation distortion was observed in large contiguous blocks on some of the linkage groups. Subsequently, we mapped the segregation distortion loci in this mapping pedigree. Altogether, eight segregation distortion loci with significant logarithm of odds supports were detected. Segregation distortion indicated the uneven transmission of the alternate alleles from the mapping parents. The corresponding genome regions might contain deleterious genes or be associated with hybridization incompatibility. In addition to the detection of segregation distortion loci, the established genetic maps will serve as a basic resource for mapping genetic loci controlling traits of interest in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W256445470,"Kaposi’s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes several tumors, including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS). Cellular and viral microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression. A better knowledge of the miRNA-mediated pathways affected by KSHV infection is therefore important for understanding viral infection and tumor pathogenesis. In this study, we used deep sequencing to analyze miRNA and cellular mRNA expression in a cell line with latent KSHV infection (SLKK) as compared to the uninfected SLK line. This approach revealed 153 differentially expressed human miRNAs, eight of which were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. KSHV infection led to the dysregulation of ~15% of the human miRNA pool and most of these cellular miRNAs were down-regulated, including nearly all members of the 14q32 miRNA cluster, a genomic locus linked to cancer and that is deleted in a number of PEL cell lines. Furthermore, we identified 48 miRNAs that were associated with a total of 1,117 predicted or experimentally validated target mRNAs; of these mRNAs, a majority (73%) were inversely correlated to expression changes of their respective miRNAs, suggesting miRNA-mediated silencing mechanisms were involved in a number of these alterations. Several dysregulated miRNA-mRNA pairs may facilitate KSHV infection or tumor formation, such as up-regulated miR-708-5p, associated with a decrease in pro-apoptotic caspase-2 and leukemia inhibitory factor LIF, or down-regulated miR-409-5p, associated with an increase in the p53-inhibitor MDM2. Transfection of miRNA mimics provided further evidence that changes in miRNAs are driving some observed mRNA changes. Using filtered datasets, we also identified several canonical pathways that were significantly enriched in differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the interleukin-8 signaling pathways. Overall, our data provide a more detailed understanding of KSHV latency and guide further studies of the biological significance of these changes."
https://openalex.org/W262808358,"Serum lipoproteins (LP) are increasingly being recognized as dual purpose molecules that contribute to both cholesterol homeostasis and host innate defense. In fact, very low LP levels are associated with increased risk of bacterial infection in critically ill patients. In this respect, we reported that apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), the 4536 amino acid structural protein of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) produced by the liver, limits Staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis. S. aureus uses quorum-sensing (QS) via the accessory gene regulator (agr) operon and an autoinducing peptide (AIP) to coordinate expression of over 200 virulence genes. ApoB100 prevents agr activation by binding and sequestering secreted AIP. Importantly, human serum LP are produced not only by the liver, but are also produced by enterocytes, in the form of chylomicrons, during uptake of dietary lipids. In contrast to apoB100 in VLDL, human enterocytes use apoB48, the N-terminal 2152 amino acids (48%) of apoB100, as the structural component of chylomicrons. Interestingly, enteral feeding of critically ill patients has been associated with decreased risk of infectious complications, suggesting chylomicrons could contribute to host innate defense in critically ill patients when serum LP production by the liver is limited during the acute phase response. Therefore, we hypothesized that apoB48 would be sufficient to antagonize S. aureus QS. As expected, isolated apoB48-LP bound immobilized AIP and antagonized agr-signaling. ApoB48- and apoB100-LP inhibited agr activation with IC50s of 3.5 and 2.3 nM, respectively, demonstrating a conserved AIP binding site. Importantly, apoB48-LP antagonized QS, limited morbidity and promoted bacterial clearance in a mouse model of S. aureus infection. This work demonstrates that both naturally occurring forms of apolipoprotein B can antagonize S. aureus QS, and may suggest a previously unrecognized role for chylomicrons and enterocytes in host innate defense against S. aureus QS-mediated pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W389591499,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the moderator effects of autonomous motivation on the relationship between subjective well-being and physical health. Using a cluster sampling approach 486 students (403 female and 83 male students) were included in this study. Subjective well-being, physical health and autonomous motivation were determined by self-report measures. Data were analysed using hierarchical regression analysis and analysis of variance. The results show that high self-determination moderates the relationship between high subjective well-being and physical health. Accordingly, the best physical health was reported by participants who had high level of subjective well-being and whose behaviours were self-determined. Additional analyses have shown that the moderating effect of self-determination is based on the moderational impact of autonomous motives and not the controlling ones. Additionally, whether autonomous motivation moderates the relationship between components of subjective well-being and physical health was also tested. The findings have shown that autonomous motives moderate relationship between physical health and one component of well-being, positive affect. Consequently, a good physical health was found among participants with high positive affect and behaviours regulated by high degree of autonomous motives. Conclusion which can be drawn from these findings is that if an individual behaves autonomously then it can contribute to positive mind-body influences and support their own health."
https://openalex.org/W1832239165,"Introduction Numerous studies have reported a strong inverse association between BMI and physical activity in western populations. Recently, the association between BMI and physical activity has been considered bidirectional. This study aimed to examine the associations of body mass index (BMI) with physical activity and sedentary behavior and to explore whether those associations were modified by socio-demographic characteristics. Materials and Methods We conducted a multistage random sampling survey in three districts of Hangzhou, China, in 2012. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire long form was used to collect data regarding physical activity and sedentary behavior. A multilevel mixed-effects regression model was used to assess the associations of BMI with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Results A total of 1362 eligible people (624 men and 738 women, ages 23-59 years) completed the survey. People who are young or middle-aged and have the highest education level are the most inactive. Significant differences in the associations between physical activity and BMI across socio-demographic groups were identified (sex*BMI, P=0.018; age*BMI, P<0.001; education level*BMI, P=0.030). Women or individuals older than 50 had a higher level of physical activity with increasing BMI. There was no statistically significant association between BMI and sedentary behavior (P=0.450). Conclusions The associations between BMI and physical activity were modified by sex, age, and education level in Hangzhou, China."
https://openalex.org/W312007611,"The skeletal muscle develops various degrees of atrophy and metabolic dysfunction following nerve injury. Neurotrophic factors are essential for muscle regeneration. Human amniotic fluid derived stem cells (AFS) have the potential to secrete various neurotrophic factors necessary for nerve regeneration. In the present study, we assess the outcome of neurological function by intramuscular injection of AFS in a muscle denervation and nerve anastomosis model.Seventy two Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-250 gm were enrolled in this study. Muscle denervation model was conducted by transverse resection of a sciatic nerve with the proximal end sutured into the gluteal muscle. The nerve anastomosis model was performed by transverse resection of the sciatic nerve followed by four stitches reconnection. These animals were allocated to three groups: control, electrical muscle stimulation, and AFS groups.NT-3 (Neurotrophin 3), BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor), CNTF (Ciliary neurotrophic factor), and GDNF (Glia cell line derived neurotrophic factor) were highly expressed in AFS cells and supernatant of culture medium. Intra-muscular injection of AFS exerted significant expression of several neurotrophic factors over the distal end of nerve and denervated muscle. AFS caused high expression of Bcl-2 in denervated muscle with a reciprocal decrease of Bad and Bax. AFS preserved the muscle morphology with high expression of desmin and acetylcholine receptors. Up to two months, AFS produced significant improvement in electrophysiological study and neurological functions such as SFI (sciatic nerve function index) and Catwalk gait analysis. There was also significant preservation of the number of anterior horn cells and increased nerve myelination as well as muscle morphology.Intramuscular injection of AFS can protect muscle apoptosis and likely does so through the secretion of various neurotrophic factors. This protection furthermore improves the nerve regeneration in a long term nerve anastomosis model."

In this study, the Kv1.3 channel S1-S2 linker was reported as a novel receptor site for human β-defensin 2 (hBD2). hBD2 shifts the conductance-voltage relationship curve of the human Kv1.3 channel in a positive direction by nearly 10.5 mV and increases the activation time constant for the channel.

https://openalex.org/W1016773569,"Schistosomiasis is an important parasitic disease worldwide that affects more than 207 million people in 76 countries and causes approximately 250,000 deaths per year. The best long-term strategy to control schistosomiasis is through immunization combined with drug treatment. Due to the ability of DNA vaccines to generate humoral and cellular immune responses, such vaccines are considered a promising approach against schistosomiasis. Sm29 and tetraspanin-2 (Sm-TSP2) are two proteins that are located in the S. mansoni tegument of adult worms and schistosomula and induce high levels of protection through recombinant protein immunization. In this study, we transfected BHK-21 cells with plasmids encoding Sm29, Sm-TSP2 or a chimera containing both genes. Using RT-PCR analysis and western blot, we confirmed that the DNA vaccine constructs were transcribed and translated, respectively, in BHK-21 cells. After immunization of mice, we evaluated the reduction in worm burden. We observed worm burden reductions of 17-22%, 22%, 31-32% and 24-32% in animals immunized with the pUMVC3/Sm29, pUMVC3/SmTSP-2, pUMVC3/Chimera and pUMVC3/Sm29 + pUMVC3/SmTSP-2 plasmids, respectively. We evaluated the humoral response elicited by DNA vaccines, and animals immunized with pUMVC3/Sm29 and pUMVC3/Sm29 + pUMVC3/SmTSP-2 showed higher titers of anti-Sm29 antibodies. The cytokine profile produced by the spleen cells of immunized mice was then evaluated. We observed higher production of Th1 cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ, in vaccinated mice and no significant production of IL-4 and IL-5. The DNA vaccines tested in this study showed the ability to generate a protective immune response against schistosomiasis, probably through the production of Th1 cytokines. However, future strategies aiming to optimize the protective response induced by a chimeric DNA construct need to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W254309193,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a major cause of invasive disease in infants. Like other Gram-positive bacteria, GBS uses a sortase C-catalyzed transpeptidation mechanism to generate cell surface pili from backbone and ancillary pilin precursor substrates. The three pilus types identified in GBS contain structural subunits that are highly immunogenic and are promising candidates for the development of a broadly-protective vaccine. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the backbone protein of pilus 2b (BP-2b) at 1.06Å resolution. The structure reveals a classical IgG-like fold typical of the pilin subunits of other Gram-positive bacteria. The crystallized portion of the protein (residues 185-468) encompasses domains D2 and D3 that together confer high stability to the protein due to the presence of an internal isopeptide bond within each domain. The D2+D3 region, lacking the N-terminal D1 domain, was as potent as the entire protein in conferring protection against GBS challenge in a well-established mouse model. By site-directed mutagenesis and complementation studies in GBS knock-out strains we identified the residues and motives essential for assembly of the BP-2b monomers into high-molecular weight complexes, thus providing new insights into pilus 2b polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2243829601,"Lactococcus garvieae is a lactic acid bacterium found in raw-milk dairy products as well as a range of aquatic and terrestrial environments. The plasmids in L. garvieae have received little attention compared to those of dairy Lactococcus lactis, in which the genes carried by these extrachromosomal elements are considered of adaptive value. The present work reports the sequencing and analysis of the plasmid complement of L. garvieae IPLA 31405, a strain isolated from a traditional, Spanish, starter-free cheese made from raw-milk. It consists of pLG9 and pLG42, of 9,124 and 42,240 nucleotides, respectively. Based on sequence and structural homology in the putative origin of replication (ori) region, pLG9 and pLG42 are predicted to replicate via a theta mechanism. Real-time, quantitative PCR showed the number of copies per chromosome equivalent of pLG9 and pLG42 to be around two and five, respectively. Sequence analysis identified eight complete open reading frames (orfs) in pLG9 and 36 in pLG42; these were organized into functional modules or cassettes containing different numbers of genes. These modules were flanked by complete or interrupted insertion sequence (IS)-like elements. Among the modules of pLG42 was a gene cluster encoding specific components of a phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (PEP-PTS) system, including a phospho-β-galacosidase. The cluster showed a complete nucleotide identity respect to that in plasmids of L. lactis. Loss of pLG42 showed this to be involved in lactose assimilation. In the same plasmid, an operon encoding a type I restriction/modification (R/M) system was also identified. The specificity of this R/M system might be broadened by different R/M specificity subunits detected in pLG9 and in the bacterial chromosome. However, challenges of L. garvieae IPLA 31405 against L. lactis phages proved that the R/M system was not involved in phage resistance. Together, these results support the hypothesis that, as in L. lactis, pLG42 contribute towards the adaptation of L. garvieae to the dairy environment."

https://openalex.org/W970829409,"Mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) X region (HBx) play important roles in hepatocarcinogenesis while the results remain controversial. We sought to clarify potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-characteristic mutations in HBx from HBV genotype C-infected patients and the distribution of those mutations in different disease phases and genotypes.HBx sequences downloaded from an online global HBV database were screened and then classified into Non-HCC or HCC group by diagnosis information. Patients' data of patient age, gender, country or area, and viral genotype were also extracted. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effects of mutations on HCC risk.1) Full length HBx sequences (HCC: 161; Non-HCC: 954) originated from 1115 human sera across 29 countries/areas were extracted from the downloaded 5956 HBx sequences. Genotype C occupied 40.6% of Non-HCC (387/954) and 89.4% of HCC (144/161). 2) Sixteen nucleotide positions showed significantly different distributions between genotype C HCC and Non-HCC groups. 3) Logistic regression showed that mutations A1383C (OR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.34-4.01), R1479C/T (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.05-3.64; OR: 5.15, 95% CI: 2.53-10.48), C1485T (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.41-4.08), C1631T (OR: 4.09, 95% CI: 1.41-11.85), C1653T (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.59-4.19), G1719T (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.19-3.73), and T1800C (OR: 23.59, 95% CI: 2.25-247.65) were independent risk factors for genotype C HBV-related HCC, presenting different trends among individual disease phases. 4) Several genotype C HCC risk mutations pre-existed, even as major types, in early disease phases with other genotypes.Mutations associated with HCC risk were mainly located in HBx transactivation domain, viral promoter, protein/miRNA binding sites, and the area for immune epitopes. Furthermore, the signatures of these mutations were unique to disease phases leading to HCC, suggesting molecular counteractions between the virus and host during hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1512840673,"In adipose and muscle cells, insulin stimulates the exocytic translocation of vesicles containing GLUT4, a glucose transporter, and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), a transmembrane aminopeptidase. A substrate of IRAP is vasopressin, which controls water homeostasis. The physiological importance of IRAP translocation to inactivate vasopressin remains uncertain. We previously showed that in skeletal muscle, insulin stimulates proteolytic processing of the GLUT4 retention protein, TUG, to promote GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake. Here we show that TUG proteolysis also controls IRAP targeting and regulates vasopressin action in vivo. Transgenic mice with constitutive TUG proteolysis in muscle consumed much more water than wild-type control mice. The transgenic mice lost more body weight during water restriction, and the abundance of renal AQP2 water channels was reduced, implying that vasopressin activity is decreased. To compensate for accelerated vasopressin degradation, vasopressin secretion was increased, as assessed by the cosecreted protein copeptin. IRAP abundance was increased in T-tubule fractions of fasting transgenic mice, when compared with controls. Recombinant IRAP bound to TUG, and this interaction was mapped to a short peptide in IRAP that was previously shown to be critical for GLUT4 intracellular retention. In cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, IRAP was present in TUG-bound membranes and was released by insulin stimulation. Together with previous results, these data support a model in which TUG controls vesicle translocation by interacting with IRAP as well as GLUT4. Furthermore, the effect of IRAP to reduce vasopressin activity is a physiologically important consequence of vesicle translocation, which is coordinated with the stimulation of glucose uptake. Background: Insulin stimulates the exocytic translocation of vesicles containing GLUT4 glucose transporters and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). Results: Insulin acts through TUG proteins to control IRAP targeting, similar to GLUT4; the activity of vasopressin, an IRAP substrate, is reduced in mice with disrupted TUG action in muscle. Conclusion: TUG regulates vasopressin action. Significance: Exocytic translocation of vesicles in muscle coordinates vasopressin inactivation with glucose uptake."

Intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir are the standard treatment for CMV infection. The present study investigates the efficacy of oral valganciclovir in CMV infection as a preemptive treatment after liver transplantation.Between 2012 and 2013, 161 patients underwent liver transplantation at Samsung Medical Center. All patients received tacrolimus, steroids, and mycophenolate mofetil. Patients with CMV infection were administered oral valganciclovir (VGCV) 900mg/day daily or intravenous ganciclovir (GCV) 5mg/kg twice daily as preemptive treatment. Stable liver transplant recipients received VGCV.Eighty-three patients (51.6%) received antiviral therapy as a preemptive treatment because of CMV infection. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the proportions of Child-Pugh class C, hepatorenal syndrome, and deceased donor liver transplantation in the CMV infection group were higher than in the no CMV infection group. Sixty-one patients received GCV and 22 patients received VGCV. The MELD scores in the GCV group were higher than in the VGCV group, but there were no statistical differences in the pretransplant variables between the two groups. AST, ALT, and total bilirubin levels in the GCV group were higher than in the VGCV group when CMV infection occurred.

Through experimentation and practice, they can control the way in which fluids move and deform to create textures and images. David Alfaro Siqueiros, a recognized Mexican muralist, invented an accidental painting technique to create new and unexpected textures. By pouring layers of paint of different colors on a horizontal surface, the paints infiltrate into each other creating patterns of aesthetic value. In this investigation, we reproduce the technique in a controlled manner. We found that for the correct color combination, the dual viscous layer becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable: the density mismatch of the two color paints drives the formation of a spotted pattern. Experiments and a linear instability analysis were conducted to understand the properties of the process. We also argue that this flow configuration can be used to study the linear properties of this instability."
https://openalex.org/W1604125332,"Small molecule nonpeptidic mimics of α-helices are widely recognised as protein-protein interaction (PPIs) inhibitors. Protein-protein interactions mediate virtually all important regulatory pathways in a cell, and the ability to control and modulate PPIs is therefore of great significance to basic biology, where controlled disruption of protein networks is key to understanding network connectivity and function. We have designed and synthesised two series of 2,6,9-substituted 8-triazolylpurines as α-helix mimetics. The first series was designed based on low energy conformations but did not display any biological activity in a biochemical fluorescence polarisation assay targeting MDM2/p53. Although solution NMR conformation studies demonstrated that such molecules could mimic the topography of an α-helix, docking studies indicated that the same compounds were not optimal as inhibitors for the MDM2/p53 interaction. A new series of 8-triazolylpurines was designed based on a combination of docking studies and analysis of recently published inhibitors. The best compound displayed low micromolar inhibitory activity towards MDM2/p53 in a biochemical fluorescence polarisation assay. In order to evaluate the applicability of these compounds as biologically active and intrinsically fluorescent probes, their absorption/emission properties were measured. The compounds display fluorescent properties with quantum yields up to 50%."
https://openalex.org/W2227640066,"Background Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airways frequently associated with asthma. Bacterial infection is a feature of CRSwNP that can aggravate the disease and the response to glucocorticoid treatment. Objective We examined whether the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduces glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function in control nasal mucosa (NM) fibroblasts and in nasal polyp (NP) fibroblasts from patients with CRSwNP and asthma. Methods NP (n = 12) and NM fibroblasts (n = 10) were in vitro pre-incubated with LPS (24 hours) prior to the addition of dexamethasone. Cytokine/chemokine secretion was measured by ELISA and Cytometric Bead Array. GRα, GRβ, mitogen-activated protein-kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) expression was measured by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, GRα nuclear translocation by immunocytochemistry, and GRβ localization by immunoblotting. The role of MKP-1 and GILZ on dexamethasone-mediated cytokine inhibition was analyzed by small interfering RNA silencing. Results Pre-incubation of nasal fibroblasts with LPS enhanced the secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, RANTES, and GM-CSF induced by FBS. FBS-induced CXCL8 secretion was higher in NP than in NM fibroblasts. LPS effects on IL-6 and CXCL8 were mediated via activation of p38α/β MAPK and IKK/NF-κB pathways. Additionally, LPS pre-incubation: 1) reduced dexamethasone’s capacity to inhibit FBS-induced IL-6, CXCL8 and RANTES, 2) reduced dexamethasone-induced GRα nuclear translocation (only in NM fibroblasts), 3) did not alter GRα/GRβ expression, 4) decreased GILZ expression, and 5) did not affect dexamethasone’s capacity to induce MKP-1 and GILZ expression. MKP-1 knockdown reduced dexamethasone’s capacity to suppress FBS-induced CXCL8 release. Conclusion The bacterial product LPS negatively affects GR function in control NM and NP fibroblasts by interfering with the capacity of the activated receptor to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study contributes to the understanding of how bacterial infection of the upper airways may limit the efficacy of glucocorticoid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W791283693,"Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is caused by atherosclerosis, results in progressive narrowing and occlusion of the peripheral arteries and inhibits blood flow to the lower extremities. Therapeutic angiogenesis is a promising strategy for treating ischemia caused by PAD. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a key mediator of angiogenesis. It has been demonstrated that β-cyclodextrincan stimulate vessel growth in rabbit corneas. In this study, we assessed the mechanism of action and therapeutic potential of a new angiogenic molecule, (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (2HP-β-CD). Methods and Results 2HP-β-CD significantly increased vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) peptides in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and also increased basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) peptide in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). 2HP-β-CD stimulated both proliferation and migration of HUVECs in an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/NO-dependent manner, whereas NO was found to be involved in proliferation, but not migration, of HASMCs. In a unilateral hindlimb ischemia model in mice, 2HP-β-CD injections not only promoted blood flow recovery and increased microvessel densities in ischemic muscle, but also promoted coverage of the vessels with smooth muscle cells, thus stabilizing the vessels. Administration of 2HP-β-CD increased the expression of several angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1) in ischemic muscle. Injections of 2HP-β-CD also stimulated protein kinase B and extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), leading to an increase in phosphorylation of eNOS in ischemic muscle. Treatment with the NOS inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), showed that stimulation of blood flow induced by 2HP-β-CD was partially dependent on NO. Conclusions Therapeutic angiogenesis by 2HP-β-CD may be beneficial to patients with PAD."
https://openalex.org/W2245508903,"Neutrophil recruitment (NR) to sites of sterile inflammation plays a key role in tissue damage and healing potential of lesions characteristic to non-infectious inflammatory diseases. Previous studies suggested significant genetic control of neutrophil survival, function, and migration in inflammatory responses to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. We have mapped the murine genome for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) harbouring genetic determinants that regulate NR in SI using a murine model of chemically-induced peritonitis. NR was quantified in 16 AXB-BXA recombinant inbred strains and their progenitors, A/J (A) and C57BL/6J (B). A continuous distribution of NR was found among the strains, with parent B showing higher NR and parent A showing lower NR (3.0-fold difference, p=0.05). Within the progeny strains, a 5.5-fold difference in NR was observed between the lowest, BXA1, and the highest responders AXB19 (p<0.001). This data was analyzed using GeneNetwork, which linked NR to one significant QTL on chromosome 12 (Peritoneal Neutrophil Recruitment 1, PNR1) and two suggestive QTLs (PNR2, PNR3) on chromosomes 12 and 16 respectively. Sixty-four candidate genes within PNR1 were cross-referenced with currently published data, mRNA expression from two NR microarrays, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The present study brings new light into the genetics of NR in response to cell injury and highlights potential candidate genes Hif1α, Fntb, and Prkch and their products for further studies on neutrophil infiltration and inflammation resolution in sterile inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2263512081,"Like most, if not all, graduate students, I faced some hurdles along the way that seemed higher than the rest. In my doctoral program at Indiana University in Bloomington, a required, but to me dreaded, seminar course in genetics stood in the way. It was a small class that was directed by a professor well known for demanding painful excellence from all those who enrolled. My self-confidence was shaky, but I knew that I did not want to strike out. To clear this intimidating bar, I chose my topic carefully and overcompensated in its preparation. I began the seminar covering the high points of a provocative theory, the concept of “the nucleosome” as an organizing principle for eukaryotic genomes, a compelling synthesis put forward by Roger Kornberg in 1974 (1Kornberg R.D. Chromatin structure: a repeating unit of histones and DNA.Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). I went on to review experimental data in support of his theoretical model, which were micrococcal nuclease digestions that revealed chromatin's repeating nature, electron microscopic evidence of its “beads-on-a-string” particulate character, and the elegant determinations of the pairwise associations of specific histone dimer pairs that might explain the core particle's stoichiometry and assembly properties. The climax of my talk was a paper that had caught my attention in a reasonably new journal, Cell (true, but not wanting to date myself). In this 1975 study, Chambon and colleagues (2Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Electron microscopic and biochemical evidence that chromatin structure is a repeating unit.Cell. 1975; 4: 281-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) elegantly showed how four core histones packaged and condensed predictable lengths of adenovirus-2 DNA. I was fascinated by this “seeing-is-believing” study; my enthusiasm was hard to contain, slipping into my seminar. Even as I was giving the talk, it occurred to me that this might have been one of my better seminars in graduate school: every word seemed to come out right. I jumped over the hurdle and finished the talk by being hooked on chromatin. Despite my unbridled enthusiasm for the general topic of chromatin, many notables in gene regulation were skeptical. At that time, chromatin was viewed by most as simply a passive packaging scheme for DNA, essentially acting little more than “salt” to help DNA fold through charge effects. To be fair, chromatin studies in this era paled in comparison with the more exciting studies on transacting transcription factors that were all the rage, well deserving of their top billing. After all, these factors engaged defined DNA control elements, such as enhancers and promoters, and they played key roles in the recruitment of RNA polymerase and company. Moreover, well defined paradigms of gene regulation had been elegantly worked out in prokaryotic models that lay the groundwork for these exciting studies. Histone proteins were viewed as only being in the way of where all of this exciting action took place. My career choice to study histone biology was a steep uphill climb, especially given the popular notion that histones did not really matter in gene regulation. My passion to enter the chromatin field as a “newbie” dictated my choice of postdoc laboratory. Many of what I perceived to be the “star gene expression labs” were filled, and I was told to apply elsewhere or to wait in line for an opening in the group, which might never come. Making matters worse, I had wanted to pursue chromatin problems in a developmental biology context, likely sticking with Drosophila, the organism on which my doctoral studies had been centered. However, none of the fly labs I visited seemed interested in studying chromatin. I returned to Bloomington, disappointed and confused at my first tastes of rejection. I had no “plan B.” A plan B came from the surprising suggestion of one of my co-workers in the lab of Anthony Mahowald, Kathy Karrer. Kathy suggested to me that I consider the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena as a model organism for chromatin studies. Being from Bloomington, I had heard of another protozoan, Paramecium, from the long-standing work in the Sonnenborn-Preer labs located one floor above my Ph.D. laboratory. However, at first glance, the idea to work on such an offbeat critter seemed to be out of the question. I was not even sure how to spell Tetrahymena. More specifically, Kathy suggested the name of Martin Gorovsky at the University of Rochester in New York, whose lab had not only worked out conditions to grow large quantities of this organism, which permitted biochemical studies, but had also developed methods to isolate purified populations of macronuclei (the active somatic nucleus) from the neighboring micronuclei (the inactive germ line nucleus). With no disrespect to anyone from upstate New York, I worried about the amount of snow that I might see in Rochester, but I knew that the choice of a postdoc lab should be “deeper” than that (pun intended). Upon more reading, I became intrigued with the nuclear dimorphism and developmental relationships exhibited by this unicellular organism in both its vegetative and sexual cycles. Moreover, I greatly enjoyed meeting Marty and his lab group during a postdoc interview. I was becoming increasingly hooked on chromatin and Tetrahymena. Soon thereafter, I made my choice, bought a snow shovel, and my wife and I headed north from Bloomington with all of our belongings in our Volkswagen bug. I felt confident that we could deal with whatever the winters would bring to Rochester. I was more worried about pursuing chromatin biology in ciliates, referred to as “pond scum” by some, and that it might be a big mistake. My postdoc years in the Gorovsky lab were good ones, maybe enriched by confinement in the lab during the long and gray winter months in Rochester. Tetrahymena had been good to me, leading to the discovery of macronuclear histone hyperacetylation, histone variants, and so on. I was psyched to ride this momentum to my first faculty position at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. While in the biochemistry department there, I made the intellectual (and emotional) commitment to focus my young group on purifying what I believed would be a worthwhile goal: the histone acetyltransferase(s) (HATs) responsible for bringing about the steady-state hyperacetylation I had observed in macronuclear histone preparations during my postdoctoral stint. Moreover, I believed that purified macronuclei were going to give me an excellent “enriched” starting source of this long sought-after enzyme activity that had eluded other groups. This was my lab's single main goal; long hours lay ahead in the cold room. Meanwhile, elegant studies carried out by Michael Grunstein at UCLA, Mitch Smith at the University of Virginia, and colleagues using the “awesome power of yeast genetics” to dissect histone function had begun to take the chromatin field by storm. Searching for invisible bands tracking HAT activity on hundreds of silver-stained gels seemed much less rewarding. Moreover, cold room work was cold and uninviting, even to me. Again, but now as a group leader, I wondered to myself if we could pull this HAT purification off, even with the biological strengths of Tetrahymena. The ultimate unwelcome news came out of left field in 1988. In a high-profile paper, Grunstein and colleagues (3Kayne P.S. Kim U.J. Han M. Mullen J.R. Yoshizaki F. Grunstein M. Extremely conserved histone H4 N terminus is dispensable for growth but essential for repressing the silent mating loci in yeast.Cell. 1988; 55: 27-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) showed that the highly conserved N-terminal domain of histone H4 was dispensable in yeast. Everyone at Baylor (and elsewhere) read Cell, and many of my colleagues, including my chair, questioned what this study meant for my research program and my future. After all, if removing the H4 N-terminal tail took away all of the well known sites of acetylation (lysines at positions 5, 8, 12, and 16) and the yeast was still viable, what did this say about the importance of histone acetylation? The simplest interpretation of their findings was that histone acetylation, at least in H4, was unimportant! Was this my “strike three?” Worse yet, one of my key R01 grants from the National Institutes of Health, all centered on the enzymology and function of histone acetylation, was up for its first competing renewal. I knew that we were on borrowed time. Again, I had no plan B. Enter Jim Brownell, a talented graduate student who remarkably seemed to like working with enzymes, even in a cold room. Perhaps my enthusiasm for the importance of histone acetylation and HATs, no less using Tetrahymena, had rubbed off on Jim? In a fairly short order, Jim bravely joined my group, got hooked on this mysterious ciliate HAT activity, and made magic happen. An ingenious in-gel HAT assay, when applied to his most purified fraction (itself isolated from 200 liters of Tetrahymena macronuclei), led Jim to a few SDS gel lanes, microsequencing, and cloning of “the band.” A 55-kDa polypeptide (p55) with strong HAT activity in the in-gel HAT assay had reared its head. The gene encoding p55 was cloned and sequenced (the old-fashioned way). Jim was richly rewarded for his cold room Herculean efforts. Tetrahymena p55 matched a previously described yeast transcriptional co-activator, Gcn5p, studied by Leonard Guarente and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their work suggested that Gcn5p played an important yet unknown positive role in transcriptional activation in yeast; however, its biochemical function remained unclear. Jim's work demonstrated that both Tetrahymena p55 and yeast Gcn5p were endowed with a novel, never-before-seen catalytic function: the job of enzymatically modifying histones. Tetrahymena p55 was the first transcription-associated (nuclear) acetyltransferase to be discovered. Jim's 1996 paper (4Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Tetrahymena histone acetyltransferase A: a homolog to yeast Gcn5p linking histone acetylation to gene activation.Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) turned out to be a landmark paper in the field (selected as a Cell Classic and annotated by Jerry Workman at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in 2014) (Fig. 1). Jim's findings were all the more remarkable when viewed in the context of a paper published the following month by Stuart Schreiber and colleagues (5Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. A mammalian histone deacetylase related to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3p.Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar) at Harvard University, who independently identified the first histone deacetylase and linked a mammalian histone deacetylase to an already known transcription repressor in yeast. Taken together, these two papers registered a one-two punch in 1996 that set the stage for what has become the modern era of chromatin biology. As a footnote, the Brownell et al. paper was published on my forty-fifth birthday (March 22) that year. Post-1996, chromatin biology as a field could proudly edge its nose out of the gene regulation closet. Although not everyone was a “true believer” of chromatin's importance, many of its harshest critics at least had to pause for some reflection. The common notion that histones were just a passive structure used to wrap DNA into defined units seemed less tenable. As suggested early on by chromatin's earliest proponents, notably Vincent Allfrey, Morton Bradbury, Colyn Crane-Robinson, and Gordon Dixon, covalent post-translational modification of histones stood as a novel dedicated and reversible “on-off switch,” brought about by defined enzyme activities contained in complexes of the much better accepted transcriptional apparatus. Moreover, modification of histone proteins was not the only mechanism by which variation could be introduced into the chromatin fiber: DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, exchange of histone variants, and so on were all being advanced by many in the field as playing critical roles in the overall equation of gene regulation. Links to human biology and disease were only beginning to emerge, but we and others sensed that the implications of what was now being collectively described as “epigenetics,” something beyond the DNA itself, were far-reaching. The fields of chromatin biology and epigenetics have witnessed many more remarkable discoveries made by many groups worldwide since 1996. Although it would be a mistake for me to attempt to list them, I look back on some of my favorites with satisfying pleasure and anticipation of more to come in years ahead. I have been known to describe the complex biochemistry of chromatin regulation to lay audiences by trying to describe the collective covalent marking of chromatin as a “language.” This analogy includes “writers,” “erasers,” and “readers” of the ever-expanding list of covalent post-translational modifications that decorate histone andnon-histone proteins. Knowing now that oncology-based drugs have been developed (some of which are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration) against members of classes of histone modification targets is most gratifying. Helping people live healthier lives is a goal we all can rally behind (Fig. 2). I like to tell seminar audiences that “every amino acid in histones matters.” This is a concept that is hard to test without the awesome power of histone genetics in genetically tractable organisms such as yeast. The year 2012 produced a “game-changing” discovery by two groups working independently and lead by Nada Jabado at McGill University and Suzanne Baker at St. Jude's Children's Hospital. In rapid succession, both teams uncovered high-frequency mutations in single copies of human histone H3 genes (6Schwartzentruber J. Korshunov A. Liu X.Y. Jones D.T. Pfaff E. Jacob K. Sturm D.

Moreover, these mutations mapped exactly at, or very close to, well known sites of histone modification, such as lysine residues that are modified by acetylation or methylation (e.g. H3 Lys-27). We and others are currently seeking to identify the underlying mechanisms affected by these dominant-acting mutations with the hope that understanding how epigenetic landscapes are altered to contribute to tumorigenesis will lead to new therapies for these affected children. Many of these children die within two years following diagnosis. The stakes are high. This battle must be won (8Mukhopadhyay R. Waiting for the day to come.ASBMB Today. 2015; 14 (in press)Google Scholar). I have been fortunate to witness a remarkable twenty-year period of scientific advances since the Brownell (4Brownell J.E.

I have enjoyed a nearly forty-year career in chromatin biology since I made the decision to enter this field as a postdoc. More than once, I questioned my career path, never having a plan B to fall back on. My advice for young scientists would be to follow their hearts, knowing that they will be tested at points and even make some mistakes along the way. Do not be afraid to take risks. For me, “doing science” is both a privilege and a passion. It is the best job in the world, and I would not trade it for anything. Science is a people-driven business, and I truly enjoy all of the many people I have met and interacted with over my career, both inside and outside of my own laboratory. Even if I am not at bat anymore or taking swings in the cold room, I manage a great team. They make it all happen; I just help them swing at the first pitch."
