https://openalex.org/W2083089709,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in host defense against microbial infection. The microbial ligands recognized by TLRs are not unique to pathogens, however, and are produced by both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms. It is thought that an inflammatory response to commensal bacteria is avoided due to sequestration of microflora by surface epithelia. Here, we show that commensal bacteria are recognized by TLRs under normal steady-state conditions, and this interaction plays a crucial role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Furthermore, we find that activation of TLRs by commensal microflora is critical for the protection against gut injury and associated mortality. These findings reveal a novel function of TLRs-control of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and protection from injury-and provide a new perspective on the evolution of host-microbial interactions."

Profiles of cancer cell signaling networks might therefore identify mechanisms by which such cells interpret environmental cues for continued growth. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we monitored phospho-protein responses to environmental cues in acute myeloid leukemia at the single cell level. By exposing cancer cell signaling networks to potentiating inputs, rather than relying upon the basal levels of protein phosphorylation alone, we could discern unique cancer network profiles that correlated with genetics and disease outcome. Strikingly, individual cancers manifested multiple cell subsets with unique network profiles, reflecting cancer heterogeneity at the level of signaling response. The results revealed a dramatic remodeling of signaling networks in cancer cells. Thus, single cell measurements of phospho-protein responses reveal shifts in signaling potential of a phospho-protein network, allowing for categorizing of cell network phenotypes by multidimensional molecular profiles of signaling."

Although PDK1 has been well characterized, the identification of the S473K remains controversial. A major PKB Ser-473 kinase activity was purified from the membrane fraction of HEK293 cells and found to be DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). DNA-PK co-localized and associated with PKB at the plasma membrane. In vitro, DNA-PK phosphorylated PKB on Ser-473, resulting in a ∼10-fold enhancement of PKB activity. Knockdown of DNA-PK by small interfering RNA inhibited Ser-473 phosphorylation induced by insulin and pervanadate. DNA-PK-deficient glioblastoma cells did not respond to insulin at the level of Ser-473 phosphorylation; this effect was restored by complementation with the human PRKDC gene. We conclude that DNA-PK is a long sought after kinase responsible for the Ser-473 phosphorylation step in the activation of PKB.

Elusive Serine Kinase Found Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 39PreviewProtein kinase B (PKB) is activated by phosphorylation of two of its residues: Thr-308 and Ser-473. While it is well established that 3-phosphoinositol-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates Thr-308, the kinase that phosphorylates Ser-473 has been a little more elusive. Now, Jianhua Feng and colleagues report on the purification and identification of this kinase.

PKB is tightly controlled and the consequences of its deregulation have been implicated in the development of cancers and diabetes (1Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E.

Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The activity of PKB is markedly stimulated in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner. Upon stimulation, PKB is recruited to the plasma membrane through the binding of its N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a lipid product of PI3K. PKBα is then activated by phosphorylation on two residues: Thr-308 in the activation loop and Ser-473 in the hydrophobic motif of the C-terminal tail (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). There is convincing evidence that Thr-308 is phosphorylated by 3-phosphoinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

In embryonic stem cells in which the PDK1 gene has been genetically disrupted, PKB is resistant to growth factor stimulation as consequence of loss of Thr-308 phosphorylation (5Williams M.R.

Like PKB, PDK1 also contains a PH domain that binds to PIP3 (4Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

Phosphorylation of Thr-308 in vivo is dependent on PI3K activity, but it is unclear if this requirement is necessary for the unfolding of PKB to allow access of PDK1 to Thr-308 site or direct activation of PDK1 through its PH domain (6Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T.

Other results indicate that PI3K is important for PKB on Ser-473 because analysis of knock-in embryonic stem cells expressing PDK1 with a mutation in its PH domain revealed that PKB is not activated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), whereas ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is activated normally, indicating the importance of co-localization of PKB with PDK1 at the plasma membrane (8McManus E.J.

Identification of the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Ser-473 has been a major challenge for a number of years but remains elusive. Several kinases have been reported to possess Ser-473 phosphorylating activity, including mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated kinase-2 (MAPKAPK-2) (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B.

However, there is evidence that these kinases are not the physiological PKB Ser-473 kinase (S473K) (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Activation of MAPKAPK-2 is PI3K-independent, whereas PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation is sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). PDK1-null cells undergo Ser-473 phosphorylation, suggesting that PDK1 is not required for Ser-473 phosphorylation (5Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin-stimulated PKB Ser-473 phosphorylation does not require activation of PDK1 or PKB, as Ser-473 phosphorylation is not sensitive to staurosporine treatment, which inhibits both PDK1 and PKB (13Hill M.M.

Overexpression of certain kinase inactive mutants can mimic wild type ILK in inducing Ser-473 phosphorylation, suggested that ILK influences PKB phosphorylation indirectly (69Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A.W. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PKB/Akt was unaffected in ILK-deficient fibroblasts (16Sakai T. Li S. Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurchenco P.D. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and chondrocytes (17Grashoff C. Aszodi A. Sakai T. Hunziker E.B. Fassler R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), indicating that ILK is not required for the phosphorylation of PKB on Ser-473. Moreover, a physiological role of ILK in regulating PKB phosphorylation has been questioned, since ILK knock-out in Drosophila melangaster shows a phenotype more similar to the integrin knock-out than to the PKB knock-out (14Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, ILK knock-out in mouse macrophages resulted in substantial inhibition of Ser-473 phosphorylation (70Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St.-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol.

The recently solved crystal structure of PKBβ reveals the importance of Ser-473 phosphorylation for PKB activation and strongly argues that autophosphorylation cannot be the physiological mechanism of Ser-473 phosphorylation (20Yang J.

We have previously identified S473K activity present in lipid rafts of plasma membrane from HEK293 cells (15Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr.

In this paper we report the purification and identification of the Ser-473 kinase(s) from HEK293 cell membrane extracts. We show here that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a dominant upstream kinase of PKB that specifically targets PKB phosphorylation on Ser-473 in vitro and in vivo. Antibodies and Chemicals—Antibodies specific for PKB phosphorylated on Thr-308 (pT308) and Ser-473 (pS473) were from Cell Signaling Technologies.

Double-stranded fetal calf thymus DNA was from Sigma, and purified HeLa DNA-PK protein (23Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W. DeLeon S. Mol. Cell.

Preparation of Plasmids and Proteins—pGEX2T-PKBα419-480 was prepared by inserting a PCR product using human PKBα cDNA as template into the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 strain and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Baculovirus-expressed ΔPH-PKBβT309P was prepared as described in Ref. 20Yang J. Cron P. Thompson V. Good V.M. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Mol.

Four-hundred plates (Ø 150 cm) of HEK293 cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 nm okadiac acid, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine) using a Polytron homogenizer. The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The crude membrane pellets were suspended in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5% glycerol) for 2 h. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 × 8 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was then extensively washed with buffer C plus 0.1 m NaCl and developed with a continuous gradient of NaCl (0.1-0.6 m) in buffer C. The fractions containing S473K activity were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C for 2 h prior to loading onto a Mono S (HR10/10) column. After washing with 10 volumes of buffer C, proteins were eluted with a continuous NaCl gradient (0.1-0.6 m) in buffer C. The kinase activity eluted between 0.34 and 0.38 m NaCl. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C. The dialyzed samples were applied onto a Mono Q (HR5/5) column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer C, and the proteins were eluted in a continuous NaCl gradient (0.1-0.5 m) in buffer C. All columns were attached to an fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration was performed using a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column attached to an fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (15Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assays—S473K activity was assayed (15Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) using the peptide RRPHFPQFSYSASSTA corresponding to the C terminus of PKBα (FSY peptide). A second peptide in which Ser-473 was changed to alanine (FAY peptide) was used to measure phosphorylation on other residues as described previously (15Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In parallel, the S473K activity was also monitored by an alternative kinase assay method using GST-PKBα419-480 as substrate followed by Western blotting with a Ser-473 phospho-specific antibody. Briefly, assays were performed in 30-μl reactions containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 MgCl2, 1 μm PKI, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 150 μm ATP, 1 μg of GST-PKBα419-480, and enzyme. After incubating for 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min at 95 °C, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with phospho-specific Ser-473 antibody. The in vitro PKB kinase assay was as described previously using the specific peptide RPRAATF (R7Ftide) as substrate (26Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 99: 333-338Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 and 3T3L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. For RNA interference, HEK293 cells were transfected with the DNA-PKcs small interfering RNA (siRNA) or a 21-nucleotide irrelevant RNA duplex as a control using oligofectamine (Invitrogen). The targeted sequence of human DNA-PKcs siRNA selected was 5′-AGGGCCAAGCTGTCACTCT-3′ (sense sequence nucleotides 5065-5083, Gen-Bank™ accession number NM_006904), and the 21-nucleotide synthetic siRNA duplex was synthesized by Qiagen. M059J and M059K were from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 4 mg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. M059J/Fus1 cells were grown in the same medium containing 250 μg/ml Geneticin. For analytical experiments, cells were starved overnight prior to treatment and the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (21Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.

Immunofluoresence—For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. After blocking, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-DNA-PK antibody (G4, 2 μg/ml diluted in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h, followed by polyclonal anti-PKB (Ab10) antibody (2 μg/ml diluted in phosphate-buffered saline) for a further 2h. Cells were then extensively washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and TR-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (both 1:100 dilution). After extensive washing, the antibodies were visualized using confocal microscopy. Immunoprecipitation—Extracts (500 μg) were incubated in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) with monoclonal DNA-PK (G4, 2 μg) or monoclonal PKB (A4D6, 2 μg) antibodies and protein G beads (20 μl, Amersham Biosciences). After 6 h continuous gentle agitation at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in co-immunoprecipitation buffer, after they were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 3 min before analysis by 6% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Purification and Identification of DNA-PKcs as a Ser-473 Kinase—We previously (15Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr.

The purification procedure was monitored using a peptide derived from the hydrophobic motif of PKBα containing Ser-473 (FSY) and a mutant peptide with Ser-473 mutated to Ala (FAY) as substrates as described in Ref. 15Hill M.M.

In parallel, specific S473K activity was also monitored using GST-PKBα419-480 (GST fusion protein containing the hydrophobic motif site) as substrate, followed by Western blotting with a Ser-473 phospho-specific antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This combined assay approach allowed the identification of the enzymes specifically targeting Ser-473 of PKB. The procedures for purification of S473K, including membrane fractionation, chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Mono S, and Mono Q columns are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The elution profile from the final Mono Q step (Fig. 1) shows two distinct kinase activities. S473K1 activity in fraction 27 specifically phosphorylated recombinant GST-PKBα419-480, with only poor activity toward the peptides (inset in Fig. 1A). The second activity (S473K2) peaking at fraction 30 phosphorylated both recombinant PKBα419-480 and Ser-473 peptides (Fig. 1A). SDS-PAGE analysis of Mono Q fractions revealed one major band of apparent molecular mass ∼350-kDa whose elution profile paralleled S473K1 activity (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, the 350-kDa bands co-eluted with S473K1 activity on gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2). The band corresponding to the 350-kDa proteins was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and the sequences of 65 peptides obtained all showed a perfect match to the human DNA-PKcs (data not shown). Western blot analysis of Mono Q fractions revealed that the 350-kDa bands corresponded to DNA-PKcs, which exactly paralleled S473K1 activity (Fig. 1C). DNA-PKcs is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family that includes mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), the ataxia telangiectasia gene product (ATM), and ATM- and RAD-3-related kinase (ATR) (27Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The holoenzyme of DNA-PK consists of a 465-kDa catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the Ku antigen complex Ku70/Ku80 (27Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the peaks of two other DNA-PK components, Ku70/Ku80, were partially resolved from the DNA-PK peak (Fig. 1C). This suggests that the partially purified DNA-PKcs can significantly phosphorylate PKB in the absence of Ku70/Ku80 subunits. Gel filtration analysis of Mono Q fraction 27 showed that the S473K1 activity eluted at ∼350 kDa and closely paralleled DNA-PKcs (Fig. 2). These results suggest that DNA-PKcs is not always complexed with the Ku70/Ku80 subunit, consistent with several earlier observations (27Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell.

As reported previously DNA-PK can be activated by DNA ends (29Dvir A Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); we therefore tested the DNA dependence of S473K1 by assaying the kinase activity of Mono Q fractions in the presence of linear double-stranded fetal calf thymus DNA. As expected, the S473K1 activity toward the substrate FSY peptide was robustly stimulated by DNA and peaked at fraction 27, corresponding exactly to DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1, A-C). It is worth noting that DNA also stimulates S473K2 activity probably due to contamination of S473K2 fractions with DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1, A and B). We are currently characterizing the protein kinase activities in the S473K2 and will be reported elsewhere.Fig. 2Analysis of S473K1 by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of S473K1 (Mono Q fraction 27) were applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences, HR10/30) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). The column was eluted with the same buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. S473K1 activity was determined with FSY/FAY peptides (A) or with GST-PKBα419-480 as substrate (upper panel in B). Aliquots of each fraction were immunoblotted for DNA-PKcs (lower panel in B). The elution positions of blue dextran (2000 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether Ser-473 phosphorylation catalyzed by purified S473K1 is sufficient for activation of PKB activity, a monophosphorylated form of recombinant PKB (ΔPH-PKBβT309P prepared by in vitro phosphorylation with PDK1 (20Yang J.

Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 99: 333-338Crossref Scopus (550) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, ΔPH-PKBβT309P activity toward R7Ftide was increased 10-fold after incubation with S473K1. Phosphorylation of ΔPH-PKBβT309P on Ser-474 (identical to Ser-473 in PKBα) was also increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Significantly we carried out in vitro phosphorylation reactions of DNA-PK with ΔPH-PKBβT309P in the presence of 5 μm staurosporine; this revealed that Ser-474 phosphorylation was unaffected by the inhibitor. This rules out the possibility that DNA-PK promotes PKB autophosphorylation because under these conditions PKB is fully inhibited by the inhibitor. We further characterized the S473K1 fraction using PI3K inhibitors known to be effective inhibitors of DNA-PK activity (27Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 28Lees-Miller P. Chen Y.R. Anderson C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, S473K1 was potently inhibited by 5 μm LY294002 and 2 μm wortmannin suggesting that DNA-PKcs is a major active component of S473K1. This result is consistent with previous cell culture data that showed Ser-473 phosphorylation is sensitive to these two inhibitors (3Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P.

We examined the rates of superoxide generation (measured as hydrogen peroxide production) by rat skeletal muscle mitochondria under a variety of conditions. The rate of superoxide production by complex I during NADH-linked forward electron transport was less than 10% of that during succinate-linked reverse electron transport even when complex I was fully reduced by pyruvate plus malate in the presence of the complex III inhibitor, stigmatellin. This asymmetry was not explained by differences in protonmotive force or its components. However, when inhibitors of the quinone-binding site of complex I were added in the presence of ATP to generate a pH gradient, there was a rapid rate of superoxide production by forward electron transport that was as great as the rate seen with reverse electron transport at the same pH gradient. These observations suggest that quinone-binding site inhibitors can make complex I adopt the highly radical-producing state that occurs during reverse electron transport. Despite complete inhibition of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity in each case, different classes of quinone-binding site inhibitor (rotenone, piericidin, and high concentrations of myxothiazol) gave different rates of superoxide production during forward electron transport (the rate with myxothiazol was twice that with rotenone) suggesting that the site of rapid superoxide generation by complex I is in the region of the ubisemiquinone-binding sites and not upstream at the flavin or low potential FeS centers.

It is well established that the mitochondrial electron transport chain produces superoxide ( O2−˙), as the result of single electron leaks to oxygen during electron transport from reduced substrates to complex IV (1Turrens J.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 552: 335-344Crossref Scopus (3657) Google Scholar). Superoxide is converted into hydrogen peroxide by the action of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Q, ubiquinone; PHPA, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid; TPMP, triphenylmethylphosphonium. in the mitochondrial matrix or by the action of copper/zinc SOD in the cytosol. If superoxide is not removed from the mitochondrial matrix, as in the case of manganese SOD nullizygous mice, severe pathologies arise, and the life-span is curtailed to about 10 days (2Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). If superoxide is not removed from the cytosol, as in the case of copper/zinc SOD nullizygous mice, the effects are not lethal, although an increase in sensitivity to oxidative stress is apparent (3Ho Y.S. Gargano M. Cao J. Bronson R.T. Heimler I. Hutz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7765-7769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus there is intense interest in superoxide and the other reactive oxygen species (ROS) it gives rise to (such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical), as ROS clearly play a role in a variety of pathological disorders and perhaps aging (4Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Oxford University Press Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 5Cadenas E. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). The sites of superoxide production within the mitochondrial electron transport chain in vitro have been localized to complexes I and III (6Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Complex I produces superoxide to the matrix side of the mitochondrial membrane exclusively, whereas complex III appears to produce superoxide to both the matrix and intermembrane space in roughly equal amounts (7St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 8Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem.

The relative importance of each complex to total superoxide production is debated; during reverse electron transport from succinate to NAD, complex I produces superoxide at very high rates (10Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J.

Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), but the physiological relevance of reverse electron transport in unclear. During forward electron transport, however (which is clearly physiological), both complexes produce superoxide at relatively low rates, unless inhibitors such as rotenone (for complex I) or antimycin A (for complex III) are present. Under these inhibited conditions with forward electron transport (which are not physiological) the superoxide production rates are relatively high. Whatever the relative importance of the complexes to total superoxide production in vivo, compared with complex III, very little is known about the mechanism of complex I superoxide production. In mitochondria, superoxide is produced by the single electron reduction of oxygen by an electron carrier within the electron transport chain. In complex III the electron carriers are cytochromes bL, bH and c1, the Rieske iron-sulfur center, and the semiquinones at centers “i” and “o.” The main reductant of oxygen to produce superoxide at complex III has been identified as the semiquinone at center o, consistent with the Q cycle mechanism of the complex (16Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). In complex I, the electron carriers are the flavin, the iron-sulfur centers N1a, N1b, N2, N3, N4, N5, and an unknown number of semiquinones (17Friedrich T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The reductant of oxygen to produce superoxide in this enzyme is not known, and published reports are highly conflicting. On thermodynamic grounds, center N1a (12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and the flavin (18Kudin A.P. Bimpong-Buta N.Y. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4127-4135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) were suggested as the main superoxide producing sites. Based on inhibitor studies, the flavin (11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 19Young T.A. Cunningham C.C. Bailey S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), center N2 (20Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and the iron-sulfur proteins and semiquinones in general (21Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were suggested as sites of superoxide production. It is feasible that all these sites produce superoxide and that production rates by different sites are tissue or condition specific. We recently demonstrated that superoxide production rates by complex I during reverse electron transport are highly dependent on the pH gradient (ΔpH) across the mitochondrial inner membrane (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). All previous studies of complex I ROS production used conditions in which the pH gradient was either zero or very low, so they probably missed the site of maximal superoxide production by the complex. It has been suggested that the main site of superoxide production within complex I is a semiquinone (6Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). As stated above, superoxide production rates by complex I during reverse electron transfer are much greater than during forward electron transfer. By investigating this asymmetry, we have found conditions in which it is abolished. Our results suggest strongly that the major site of superoxide production in complex I is the quinone-binding site; it is most likely a semiquinone. Materials—Piericidin A was a kind gift from Dr. Mauro Degli Esposti (University of Manchester, UK). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Measurement of Mitochondrial Superoxide Production—Mitochondria from skeletal muscle of female Wistar rats (aged between 5 and 8 weeks) were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (23Rolfe D.F.S. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Superoxide production rate was assessed by measurement of hydrogen peroxide generation rate, determined fluorometrically by measurement of oxidation of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (PHPA) coupled to the enzymatic reduction of H2O2 by horseradish peroxidase. Mitochondria (0.35 mg of mitochondrial protein·ml–1) were incubated at 37 °C in standard buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 3 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) (pH 7.2 at 37 °C). All incubations also contained 50 μg·ml–1 PHPA, 4 units·ml–1 horseradish peroxidase, 30 units·ml–1 superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 1.875 μm triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+) bromide. The reaction was initiated by addition of respiratory substrates; after 1 min the increase in fluorescence at an excitation of 320 nm and emission of 400 nm was followed on a computer-controlled Shimadzu RF5301 spectrofluorometer for 2–3 min. Appropriate corrections for background signals were applied (7St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar), and standard curves generated using known amounts of H2O2 were used to calculate the rate of H2O2 production in nmol·min–1·mg mitochondrial protein–1. Essentially all the superoxide from complex I is generated on the matrix side of the inner membrane and then converted by endogenous processes to H2O2, which leaks out and is measured in the assay (7St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Certain compounds employed in the experiments (such as myxothiazol and ATP) caused significant quenching of the fluorescent signals; therefore careful calibration with standard curves generated for all conditions was essential to obtain the correct rates of H2O2 production. Measurement of Mitochondrial Protonmotive Force (Δp)—Mitochondrial membrane potential, Δψ, was determined using an electrode sensitive to TPMP+ as described (24Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle mitochondria were incubated under the same conditions as for superoxide production at 37 °C in standard buffer with PHPA, horseradish peroxidase, and SOD. The electrode was calibrated by sequential 0.375 μm additions of TPMP+ up to 1.875 μm. The reaction was initiated by addition of respiratory substrate, and Δψ was measured upon reaching the steady state (∼1 min). The chemical component of protonmotive force, ΔpH, was then measured as the change in ΔΨ after ΔpH was converted to Δψ following addition of 100 nm nigericin. After each run, the uncoupler carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added to 2 μm to release the TPMP+ and allow correction for any small drift in the TPMP+ electrode. Potentials were calculated as described (24Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995: 39-62Google Scholar), on the basis that Δp = Δψ + ΔpH (all in mV, giving positive signs to electrical potentials that were positive outside and pH gradients that were acid outside). Determination of NADH:Q2 Oxidoreductase Activity—Complex I activity was assessed by monitoring the disappearance of 25 μm NADH with 125 μm coenzyme Q2 as an electron acceptor. NADH was monitored fluorometrically at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 450 nm, respectively, under identical incubation and buffer conditions to those used for measurement of H2O2 and Δp. To allow NADH to react with complex I, the mitochondria were broken open by three freeze-thaw cycles prior to assay. The concentrations of rotenone, piericidin, and myxothiazol required to achieve maximal inhibition of complex I were determined by titration. Statistics—Values are given as means ± S.E. with n being the number of separate mitochondrial preparations. The significance of differences between means was assessed by unpaired Student's t test; p values < 0.05 were taken to be significant. Comparison of Superoxide Production by Complex I during Forward and Reverse Electron Transport—A series of experiments (Fig. 1) was conducted to examine production of superoxide during forward and reverse electron transport by complex I. As shown in Fig. 1a, with pyruvate + malate as substrates, the rate of H2O2 production from the entire electron transport chain was low, only 0.03 nmol·min–1·mg protein–1. A similar rate was found for another combination of forward electron transport linked substrates: glutamate + malate (not shown). With succinate as substrate the rate of superoxide production was some 100-fold greater (Fig. 1a) and was localized almost entirely at complex I during reverse electron transport (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The high rate of superoxide production during reverse electron transport into complex I is very sensitive to the pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), since conversion of ΔpH to Δψ by the addition of nigericin strongly inhibited superoxide production (Fig. 1a). There was no significant difference in ΔpH between mitochondria oxidising succinate and pyruvate + malate (Table I), so the differences in superoxide production between forward and reverse electron transport are not simply due to differences in ΔpH. Nigericin did not significantly alter superoxide production rate with pyruvate + malate (Fig. 1a), showing that with forward electron transport, ΔpH has no detectable effect on superoxide production rate under these conditions.Table IValues of ΔpH, Δψ, and Δp under various conditionsΔψΔpHΔpmVmVmVSuccinate141 ± 440 ± 5181 ± 5Pyruvate + malate143 ± 534 ± 4177 ± 5Pyruvate + malate + nigericin177 ± 5aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0177 ± 5Pyruvate + malate + rotenone0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + rotenone + ATP127 ± 622 ± 5149 ± 2Pyruvate + malate + piericidin0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + piericidin + ATP131 ± 413 ± 4aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.144 ± 2aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + myxothiazol0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + myxothiazol + ATP130 ± 1aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.11 ± 1aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.141 ± 5aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + stigmatellin0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + stigmatellin + ATP126 ± 5aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.25 ± 8151 ± 4aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + KCN0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + KCN + ATP137 ± 429 ± 1166 ± 3Pyruvate + malate + antimycin A0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.0 ± 0aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.Pyruvate + malate + antimycin A + ATP118 ± 5aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.25 ± 1144 ± 5aSignificant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate.a Significant (p < 0.05) difference from pyruvate + malate. Open table in a new tab It might be that the complex I superoxide-producing site is more reduced during reverse electron transport, when electrons are forced into the complex using the high Δp (and perhaps the high ubiquinone reduction state) generated by succinate oxidation, than it is during forward electron transport, when Δp may be a little lower (Table I) and when the ubiquinone pool may be more oxidized. To test this possibility, we added the complex I inhibitors rotenone, piericidin, or myxothiazol, to allow the complex to become fully reduced by electrons from pyruvate + malate. Myxothiazol is a center o inhibitor of complex III, but at high concentrations it is also an effective inhibitor of complex I (20Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 25Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Addition of any one of these inhibitors did increase H2O2 production from pyruvate + malate, with myxothiazol having the largest effect, followed by piericidin then rotenone (Fig. 1b). The differences between inhibitors were not due to different levels of inhibition of complex I; Fig. 2 shows that superoxide production was near maximal for each inhibitor, and Fig. 3 shows that each caused maximal inhibition of NADH:Q2 oxidoreductase activity at the concentration used. However, even with myxothiazol, H2O2 production rates were still only one-third of those seen with reverse electron transport, so the reduction state of superoxide-generating sites upstream of the sites where these inhibitors work in complex I may contribute to the difference in superoxide production between reverse and forward electron transport but cannot fully explain it.Fig. 3Inhibition of complex I NADH:Q2 oxidoreductase activity by rotenone, piericidin, and myxothiazol. Incubation conditions are the same as those described for Fig. 1. Points represent means ± S.E. of measurements on three separate mitochondrial preparations.

If so, then blocking this site with Q-type inhibitors (rotenone, piericidin, or high concentrations of myxothiazol) may inhibit superoxide production during forward electron transport, and the high rates seen with succinate cannot be achieved. To test this possibility, a condition is required in which the Q-binding site within complex I is fully reduced with forward electron transport but open (i.e. uninhibited). One way to achieve this condition would be to use a low concentration of myxothiazol, so that only center o of complex III is inhibited. The concentration of myxothiazol required to fully inhibit complex III in our system was 0.625 μm (not shown), but this concentration also inhibited complex I activity by about 40% (Fig. 3). Hence the Q-binding sites were not fully open at this relatively low myxothiazol concentration under the conditions employed. Another center o inhibitor of complex III is stigmatellin (26Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A. Crimi M. Estornell E. Fato R. Lenaz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which at 80 nm did not inhibit complex I activity at all (not shown) but did inhibit complex III, as Δp was zero (Table I). We tested the effects of stigmatellin and two other different combinations of substrates and inhibitors that produce an open Q-binding site but reduced complex I during forward electron transport; the results are shown in Fig. 1c. The first other condition was pyruvate + malate plus potassium cyanide, which will cause maximal reduction of all complexes upstream of complex IV. The second other condition employed pyruvate + malate plus antimycin A (which gives complex I superoxide plus maximal superoxide production from complex III) minus the rate with succinate plus rotenone plus antimycin A (which gives maximal superoxide from complex III only). None of the three conditions tested caused the rate of superoxide production by complex I with forward electron transport to approach the rates seen with succinate alone. In the presence of stigmatellin, the rate of superoxide production was less than 10% of the rate during reverse electron transport with succinate seen in Fig. 1a. Therefore a fully reduced and open Q-binding site with forward electron transport is not sufficient to give high rates of superoxide production by complex I. The Effect of ΔpH on Superoxide Production during Forward Electron Transport—Under the conditions of pyruvate + malate + inhibitor shown in Fig. 1, ΔpH and Δψ are zero (Table I) because there is no proton pumping by the electron transport chain. As shown previously, H2O2 production by complex I is particularly sensitive to ΔpH during reverse electron transport (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), so could the remaining difference in superoxide production rate between forward and reverse electron flow be caused by the lack of ΔpH during inhibited forward electron transport? The effects of ΔpH were tested using hydrolysis of added ATP to produce ΔpH and Δψ (Table I). As shown in Fig. 4a, ATP addition did elevate rates of H2O2 production with all three complex I inhibitors, and these increases were abolished by addition of nigericin, which brings ΔpH to zero while raising Δψ. In the presence of pyruvate + malate plus myxothiazol and ATP, ΔpH was about 10 mV (Table I), and the rate of H2O2 production was about 1.6 nmol·min–1·mg protein–1 (Fig. 4a), which is the same as the rate achieved by reverse electron transport from succinate at the same ΔpH (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The increases in H2O2 production seen upon addition of ATP were prevented when oligomycin was present in the medium (not shown), indicating that the effects of ATP were mediated by the ATPase. In support of these conclusions, we found that ATP hydrolysis could be replaced by succinate oxidation; the rate of H2O2 production was high when succinate was added in the presence of pyruvate + malate and either rotenone or piericidin (not shown). Experiments with pyruvate + malate plus either stigmatellin, KCN, or antimycin A with ATP are shown in Fig. 4b. It can be seen that imposition of a pH gradient did not permit generation of superoxide at high rates in the absence of Q site inhibitors. Therefore, a reduced, open Q-binding site in the presence of ΔpH during forward electron transport is not sufficient to generate the large amounts of superoxide seen during reverse electron transport. However, complex I with its Q-binding site inhibited by myxothiazol (or, to a lesser extent, by piericidin or rotenone) in the presence of ΔpH during forward electron transport is able to generate superoxide at the same rate as it does during reverse electron transport from succinate in the absence of any Q site inhibitor. The Effect of Matrix pH on Superoxide Production during Forward Electron Transport—Using the protocol previously described (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), we checked that the strong inhibitory effect of nigericin on H2O2 production in the presence of pyruvate + malate, myxothiazol, and ATP (Fig. 4a) was not simply due to changes in internal pH (Fig. 5). At any internal pH, the rate of H2O2 production was greater in the absence of nigericin than in its presence. Thus, like superoxide generation during reverse electron transport, superoxide generation during forward electron transport under these conditions is dependent on ΔpH. In agreement with previous studies (10Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J.

Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we show that superoxide production by complex I during reverse electron transport is huge compared with forward electron transport under similar conditions. This asymmetry of superoxide production by complex I has not previously been investigated in detail, and no mechanistic explanation of it has been offered in the literature. We characterized superoxide production by complex I and addressed two questions: under what conditions can complex I produce superoxide during forward electron transport at the high rates seen during reverse electron transport in intact mitochondria (in other words, can the asymmetry be explained), and which site in complex I generates the majority of the superoxide? Conditions of High Rates of Superoxide Production by Compex I—In terms of conditions, first, we demonstrate that a pH gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane during forward (Figs. 4a and 5) or reverse (Fig. 1a and Ref. 22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) electron transfer is required for high rates of superoxide production. The pH gradient can be generated by proton pumping by substrate oxidation (in the case of succinate) or by ATP hydrolysis via the ATPase (when the electron transport chain is inhibited). Second, we show that a relatively reduced complex I (as a whole) may be required but is not sufficient for high superoxide generation rates. During reverse electron transport an overall high reduction state is achieved by the high Δp forcing electrons from succinate into complex I. However, with forward electron transport, if a reduced complex I was sufficient for high superoxide production, then large rates would have been observed with pyruvate + malate plus stigmatellin, KCN, or ((antimycin A) minus (succinate + rotenone + antimycin A)). This was not the case; even when ATP was added to generate ΔpH, the superoxide production rates remained low under these conditions compared with the rates seen with succinate. Third, we have found that direct Q site inhibition is required for high rates of superoxide production by complex I during forward electron transport. Only in the presence of either rotenone, piericidin, or myxothiazol (and ΔpH) was the superoxide production rate high with forward electron transport (Fig. 4a). All three Q site inhibitors fully inhibited NADH:Q oxidoreductase activity, but myxothiazol was more effective at inducing superoxide production than piericidin, which in turn was more effective than rotenone. This situation appears analogous to the case with complex III. In its native (uninhibited) state, complex III produces superoxide at low rates, but in the presence of antimycin A the rate increases dramatically (7St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 13Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 15Han D. Canali R. Rettori D. Kaplowitz N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). During forward electron transport, complex I produces superoxide at very low rates in its native state, but the rate can increase 10–30-fold in the presence of Q site inhibitors. Our findings are in good agreement with a previous report on superoxide production in heart submitochondrial particles (20Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Using NADH to generate forward electron transport, a very low superoxide production rate was observed. This rate increased by about 3-fold when mucidin was used to block center o of complex III. However 10-fold increases in rate were seen in the presence of various complex I Q site inhibitors, and from our results it is likely these rates would have been even higher in the presence of ΔpH. Therefore, the conditions that explain the asymmetry of superoxide production between forward and reverse electron transport are very specific. The asymmetry is not simply due to differences in the overall redox state of complex I or differences in protonmotive force or its components. High rates of superoxide production, in the presence of ΔpH, were only achieved with the native enzyme during reverse electron transport (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) or in the presence of Q site inhibitors during forward electron transport. The simplest explanation of these observations is that there is a particular state of complex I that leads to high superoxide production, and this state can be accessed either during reverse electron transport, or during forward electron transport when an inhibitor occupies the Q-binding site. The fact that different rates of superoxide production were obtained with the three different Q site inhibitors is consistent with the concept of two or three classes of complex I inhibitor with different degrees of overlap in a large Q-binding pocket (25Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 27Okun J.G. Lummen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Occupation of one of these binding sites by an inhibitor would trigger superoxide production by promoting the reaction with oxygen of some reductant either within the Q site (such as a semiquinone) or elsewhere within complex I. Sites of Superoxide Production by Complex I—Which sites in complex I generate superoxide at high rates? If the main or only site of the high superoxide production we observe in the presence of ATP is upstream of the Q-binding site (i.e. from iron sulfur centers N1a, N1b, N3, N4, N5, or flavin), then, for a simple linear chain of electron carriers, addition of any Q site inhibitor should result in the same rate of superoxide production. This was not the case; we observed different increases (myxothiazol > piericidin > rotenone) in the rate of superoxide production from pyruvate + malate in both the absence (Fig. 1) and presence (Fig. 4a) of ATP. In addition, if sites upstream of Q generate superoxide, then the production rates from complex I should be similar with the Q site inhibitors and with stigmatellin, KCN, or antimycin A. This was clearly not the case (Fig. 4b). We conclude, therefore, that the sites upstream of Q must produce superoxide at low rates compared with the Q site itself, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Some reports (11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) suggest that these upstream sites are mainly responsible for complex I superoxide production. It is difficult to compare the results from different laboratories, as the tissues used, methods of mitochondrial and submitochondrial particle isolation, ROS detection systems, buffer components, and correction for background signals all vary. However, one consistent factor appears to be that all of these previous studies used conditions in which ΔpH was either zero (the mitochondria or submitochondrial particles were deenergized) or low (e.g. due to the presence of phosphate in the medium (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar)). Therefore, superoxide production was probably not maximal in these studies, and they missed the site of high superoxide production discussed here. Their conclusions may be valid for the minor sites of superoxide production but would not be relevant to the major site of complex I superoxide production analyzed here. As discussed above, complex III only generates superoxide at high rates when antimycin A is present. This behavior is consistent with the Q cycle and is explained by the formation of a semiquinone at center o of the complex that reduces oxygen to superoxide (28Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). By analogy, perhaps the requirement for Q site inhibitors for maximum superoxide production by complex I reflects Q cycle-type behavior in this complex too and suggests that the reductant of oxygen to produce superoxide is a semiquinone. The coupling mechanism of complex I remains unknown, but analogies to the Q cycle in complex III have been proposed (29Dutton P.L. Moser C.C. Sled V.D. Daldal F. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Other models have been suggested that are consistent with Q cycle-type behavior in the enzyme (30Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Where within the Q site could superoxide be produced? EPR studies have detected at least three ubisemiquinone species within complex I, termed SQNf, SQNs, and SQNx for fast relaxing, slow relaxing, and very slow relaxing semiquinone (31Yano T. Magnitsky S. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D. Burbaev D.S. Grivennikova V.G. Moroz I.A. Ohnishi T.

Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If there is a Q cycle mechanism in complex I, then as well as the canonical quinone reducing site there must be at least one additional quinone reduction and one quinol oxidation site. Recent models of complex I propose three different semiquinone sites: two quinone reduction sites and one quinol oxidation site (6Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 30Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Three classes of inhibitor have been described, possibly corresponding to three semiquinone species in a large Q-binding pocket (25Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 27Okun J.G. Lummen P. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2625-2630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Of these species, only SQNf exhibits sensitivity to Δp. Since superoxide production is very sensitive to Δp, then SQNf might be the reductant of oxygen in complex I. If so, SQNf should exhibit high sensitivity to ΔpH. In addition, both rotenone and piericidin quench the SQNf radical, which would explain why they quench superoxide production from succinate. Fig. 7 displays a tentative model of superoxide production at the semiquinone in one of the Q reducing sites of complex I that is consistent with the observations presented here and previously (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Superoxide Production as a Tool to Investigate the Coupling Mechanism of Complex I—As discussed previously (22Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), one of the reasons why the coupling mechanism of complex I has remained elusive is the lack of easily studied intermediates. Superoxide production by complex I is an indirect measure of the redox status of a free radical intermediate in complex I and is fairly straightforward to measure. It is likely that this intermediate is a semiquinone and closely involved in the coupling reaction, as it is ΔpH-sensitive. We suggest, therefore, that superoxide production by complex I may be a useful tool to gain mechanistic insights into complex I. We thank Steven Roebuck, Helen Boysen, and Julie Buckingham for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2170996392,"An important signaling pathway to the actin cytoskeleton links the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 to the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex through N-WASP. Nevertheless, these previously identified components are not sufficient to mediate Cdc42-induced actin polymerization in a physiological context. In this paper, we describe the biochemical purification of Toca-1 (transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly) as an essential component of the Cdc42 pathway. Toca-1 binds both N-WASP and Cdc42 and is a member of the evolutionarily conserved PCH protein family. Toca-1 promotes actin nucleation by activating the N-WASP-WIP/CR16 complex, the predominant form of N-WASP in cells. Thus, the cooperative actions of two distinct Cdc42 effectors, the N-WASP-WIP complex and Toca-1, are required for Cdc42-induced actin assembly. These findings represent a significantly revised view of Cdc42-signaling and shed light on the pathogenesis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2114918924,"In cells lacking centrosomes, such as those found in female meiosis, chromosomes must nucleate and stabilize microtubules in order to form a bipolar spindle. Here we report the identification of Dasra A and Dasra B, two new components of the vertebrate chromosomal passenger complex containing Incenp, Survivin, and the kinase Aurora B, and demonstrate that this complex is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle formation. The failure of microtubule stabilization caused by depletion of the chromosomal passenger complex was rescued by codepletion of the microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin MCAK, whose activity is negatively regulated by Aurora B. By contrast, we present evidence that the Ran-GTP pathway of chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation does not require the chromosomal passenger complex, indicating that the mechanisms of microtubule assembly by these two pathways are distinct. We propose that the chromosomal passenger complex regulates local MCAK activity to permit spindle formation via stabilization of chromatin-associated microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2118660831,"A fundamental question in developmental biology is how a limited number of growth factors and their cognate receptors coordinate the formation of tissues and organs endowed with enormous morphological complexity. We report that the related neurotrophins NGF and NT-3, acting through a common receptor, TrkA, are required for sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth and, thus, innervation of target fields. Yet, while NGF supports TrkA internalization and retrograde signaling from distal axons to cell bodies to promote neuronal survival, NT-3 cannot. Interestingly, final target-derived NGF promotes expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor, in turn causing a reduction in the sensitivity of axons to intermediate target-derived NT-3. We propose that a hierarchical neurotrophin signaling cascade coordinates sequential stages of sympathetic axon growth, innervation of targets, and survival in a manner dependent on the differential control of TrkA internalization, trafficking, and retrograde axonal signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2024254525,"cAMP can be either mitogenic or anti-mitogenic, depending on the cell type. We demonstrated previously that cAMP inhibited the proliferation of normal renal epithelial cells and stimulated the proliferation of cells derived from the cysts of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients. The protein products of the genes causing PKD, polycystin-1 and polycystin-2, are thought to regulate intracellular calcium levels, suggesting that abnormal polycystin function may affect calcium signaling and thus cause a switch to the cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted intracellular calcium mobilization by treating immortalized mouse M-1 collecting duct cells and primary cultures of human kidney epithelial cells with calcium channel blockers and by lowering extracellular calcium with EGTA. Calcium restriction for 3–5 h converted both cell types from a normal cAMP growth-inhibited phenotype to an abnormal cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype, characteristic of PKD. In M-1 cells, we showed that calcium restriction was associated with an elevation in B-Raf protein levels and cAMP-stimulated, Ras-dependent activation of B-Raf and ERK. Moreover, the activity of Akt, a negative regulator of B-Raf, was decreased by calcium restriction. Inhibition of Akt or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase also allowed cAMP-dependent activation of B-Raf and ERK in normal calcium. These results suggest that calcium restriction causes an inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which relieves the inhibition of B-Raf to allow the cAMP growth-stimulated phenotypic switch. Finally, M-1 cells stably overexpressing an inducible polycystin-1 C-terminal cytosolic tail construct were shown to exhibit a cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype involving B-Raf and ERK activation, which was reversed by the calcium ionophore A23187.

PKD is caused by loss of function mutations in either of two genes, PKD1 or PKD2, thus resulting in insufficient levels of their protein products, polycystin-1 or polycystin-2. It is thought that each cyst is the result of the abnormal growth of a single cell, which proliferates out of control, expanding the tubule wall until the cyst pinches off and continues to grow to a large size by continued cell proliferation and by the secretion of fluid into the cyst lumen. The progressive enlargement of numerous cysts in affected kidneys leads to renal failure in about half of PKD patients. cAMP may have a central role in cyst growth by stimulating both fluid secretion and cell proliferation (24Calvet J.P.

It has been demonstrated that normal renal epithelial cells are growth-inhibited by cAMP, whereas cyst epithelial cells are growth-stimulated. These studies have shown that cultured normal renal tubular epithelial cells have decreased rates of cell proliferation in response to treatment with cAMP, which inhibits the Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway at the level of Raf-1 (30Yamaguchi T.

In contrast, cultured cyst epithelial cells from PKD kidneys show increased rates of cell proliferation in response to cAMP, which activates B-Raf instead of inhibiting Raf-1. B-Raf then activates the MEK/ERK pathway and cell proliferation. This so-called “PKD phenotype” can be mimicked in mouse M-1 cortical collecting duct cells by stable transfection and inducible overexpression of a short, polycystin-1 cytosolic C-terminal tail construct (31Sutters M.

Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 are thought to be components of a multiprotein signaling complex that is involved in regulating intracellular calcium levels in response to yet-to-be-determined extracellular signals (32Delmas P.

We considered the possibility that disruption of polycystin function, either by loss of a functional PKD gene or by overexpression of a polycystin-1 C-tail construct, might affect calcium mobilization and thus induce the cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype characteristic of PKD cells. To test this idea, we disrupted intracellular calcium mobilization by treating immortalized mouse M-1 cells and primary cultures of normal human kidney epithelial cells with calcium channel blockers or EGTA to lower intracellular calcium. These conditions were found to convert the cells from a normal cAMP growth-inhibited phenotype to a cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype. Cells treated with calcium-lowering reagents showed cAMP-dependent activation of B-Raf and ERK, suggesting that the cAMP growth stimulation is dependent on B-Raf activation. Because B-Raf can be inhibited by Akt in a PI3K- and calcium-dependent manner, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of PI3K and Akt had an effect on the cAMP-dependent cell-growth phenotype. We found that these inhibitors allowed cAMP-dependent activation of B-Raf and ERK in the presence of normal levels of calcium, thus supporting a role for PI3K and Akt in suppressing cAMP-dependent B-Raf signaling and preventing the phenotypic switch. Finally, M-1 cells stably expressing the polycystin-1 C-tail fragment were shown to exhibit cAMP-dependent activation of B-Raf and ERK and a cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype that was reversed by tonic calcium repletion. We conclude from these experiments that disruption of calcium mobilization in cells that are normally growth-inhibited by cAMP can derepress the B-Raf/ERK pathway, thus converting these cells to a phenotype that is growth-stimulated by cAMP. Cell Culture—M-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (50:50) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin as described previously (31Sutters M.

The kidney retrieval protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Kansas Medical Center. Cell Proliferation Assays—2 × 103 M-1 cells or 4 × 103 HKC cells were seeded onto individual chambers of a 96-well culture plate. The cells were incubated in DMEM/F-12 with 1% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. After 24 h, the FBS was reduced to 0.002%. 24 h later, cells were treated with dexamethasone (DEX), 8-Br-cAMP, calcium channel blockers, EGTA, or the calcium ionophore A23187 (see figure legends) for another 48 (M-1 cells) or 72 h (HKC cells). Cell proliferation was determined by counting cell numbers in a hemocytometer or by the Promega Cell Titer 96 MTT assay method, which measures the optical density of a proliferation-dependent reaction product (29Yamaguchi T.

Western Blot Assays—Cells were seeded onto 100-mm diameter plastic dishes containing DMEM/F-12 with 1% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. At 75–80% confluence, FBS was reduced to 0.002%, and the cells were grown for 24 h. The cells were then treated with various combinations of DEX, calcium channel blockers, EGTA, A23187, Akt inhibitor, Bay-K8644, H89, LY294002, PD98059, and/or PP1. 8-Br-cAMP was added for the final 15 min. Cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Insoluble cell lysate was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of soluble cellular protein were measured by the BCA protein assay kit. Cell lysate (20 μg of protein) was then heated (95–100 °C) in SDS sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk in TBS-T, pH 8.0 (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (see figure legends) in 5% powdered milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies with 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T, and proteins were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Intensity was detected and quantitatively analyzed by the Fluor-S MAX multi-imager system (Bio-Rad). Transient Transfection Assays—M-1 cells were plated in DMEM/F-12 plus 5% FBS at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in serum-free DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5 μg per well HA-p44ERK-1 DNA (from J. Kyriakis) plus 0.5 μg per well of one of the following DNAs: Rap1A G12V (constitutively active) 2xMYC; Rap1B G12V 2xMYC; H-Ras G12V 2xMYC; Rap1A S17N (dominant negative) 2xMYC; Rap1B S17N 2xMYC; H-Ras S17N 2xMYC, all from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center (Sayre, PA). After 5 h, the transfection solution was replaced with DMEM/F-12 plus 0.002% FBS, and the cells were cultured overnight and were either left untreated or were treated with verapamil for an additional 5 h. 8-Br-cAMP was added for the final 15 min as indicated. Cells were lysed as described above, and the lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibody conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The beads were boiled in loading buffer (without dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol); the supernatants were collected and re-boiled in loading buffer with dithiothreitol and mercaptoethanol, and the samples were electrophoresed and blotted as described above. Blocked membranes were incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, washed, and visualized as described above. B-Raf and Raf-1 Kinase Assays—M-1 cells (wild-type or clone 20) were cultured as described above with or without DEX, inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, EGTA, and/or 8-Br-cAMP (see figure legends). The in vitro B-Raf kinase assay was modified from that of Erhardt et al. (43Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 500 μg of clarified cellular extract was immunoprecipitated for 2 h with gentle rotation at 4 °C with anti-B-Raf antibody covalently coupled to protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed and resuspended in 20 μl of 0.5 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% Brij 35. For the radioactive assay, reaction mixtures containing 20 μl of 16 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 1 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.5 μg of human full-length MEK-1 fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were mixed with 20 μl of the resuspended beads, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and stopped with SDS sample buffer. Samples were heated (95–100 °C); beads were sedimented; supernatants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and placed under x-ray film. For the nonradioactive assay, reaction mixtures containing 20 μl of 16 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 1 mm ATP, and 2 μg of human MEK-1 fusion protein were mixed with 20 μl of the resuspended beads, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and stopped with SDS sample buffer. After electrophoresis and transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% powdered milk in TBS-T, pH 8.0, for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were incubated with phospho-MEK antibody in 5% powdered milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with secondary antibody with 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times with TBS-T, and proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence. Phospho-MEK was detected and quantitated with the Fluor-S MAX multi-imager system. Raf-1 kinase activity was determined using the nonradioactive assay and anti-Raf-1 antibody covalently coupled to protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Changes of intracellular calcium and the magnitude of calcium release from thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores were determined using Fura-2. M-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips (25 mm diameter) as subconfluent monolayers in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% FBS. Monolayers receiving the same growth conditions were incubated in either control medium or medium containing 1 μm verapamil for 24 h prior to the experiment. Cells were loaded with 10 μm Fura-2/AM for 60 min at room temperature, and then rinsed in control medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were mounted in a thermal-controlled chamber on the stage of a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a monochromator for selecting excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. The chamber was continuously perfused with DMEM/F-12 equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Emitted light was measured at 510 nm with a photomultiplier detection system (Photo Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). Felix 32 analysis software (Photo Technology International) controlled the monochromator and data acquisition to generate the 340:380 excitation ratio. For each monolayer, a steady-state level of intracellular calcium was established, and 1 μm thapsigargin was then added to deplete calcium stores. Antibodies—Anti-ERK1 (C-16), -ERK2 (C-14), -phospho-ERK (E-4), -B-Raf (C-19), -Raf-1 (C-12), and -Akt (C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-MEK-1 and -2 (Ser-222) and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) were from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Anti-rabbit, -mouse, -rat, or -goat IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Statistics—Mean and S.E. were calculated, and levels of significant difference were determined by unpaired t test. We demonstrated previously that HKC cells are growth-inhibited by cAMP agonists, whereas cyst wall epithelial cells from PKD kidneys are growth-stimulated by cAMP (29Yamaguchi T. Pelling J.C.

This cAMP-proliferative phenotype can also be demonstrated in mouse M-1 cortical collecting duct cells by stable transfection and overexpression of a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible polycystin-1 C-tail construct, which appears to act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit endogenous polycystin function (31Sutters M.

Because the polycystins are thought to regulate calcium mobilization, we reasoned that this phenotypic switch may be caused by a disruption of calcium signaling in these stably transfected cells. If so, the PKD-like cAMP growth-stimulated phenotype may be mimicked in parental (wild-type) M-1 cells by treatment with calcium channel blockers. As seen in Fig. 1A, the rate of cell proliferation of control parental M-1 cells was decreased following treatment with cAMP. In contrast, the rate of proliferation of these cells was increased with cAMP in the presence of the nonspecific calcium channel blocker gadolinium and the L-type calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil, and the effect of the calcium channel blockers was diminished by the calcium ionophore A23187. Normal HKC cells were also growth-stimulated by cAMP in the presence of the calcium channel blockers (Fig. 1B). This effect was also seen in M-1 cells following incubation in media containing calculated free calcium concentrations ranging from 0.46 to 0.26 mm with the addition of EGTA (Fig. 1C). To show that this effect was because of the decreased free calcium rather than the EGTA per se, the EGTA concentration was increased to >1 mm (Fig. 1C, rightmost bar) in the presence of an excess of calcium. As shown, a high level of extracellular calcium, even in the presence of EGTA, was sufficient to confer a normal, growth-inhibited response to cAMP. To demonstrate that calcium channel blockers are able to decrease intracellular calcium levels, M-1 cells were incubated for 24 h in 1 μm verapamil. The cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM, and steady-state levels of intracellular calcium were measured. As shown in Fig. 1D, steady-state intracellular calcium levels and the capacity of thapsigargin-sensitive calcium stores were decreased by calcium restriction. Thus, it appears that a normal, cAMP growth-inhibited phenotype requires normal levels of calcium and that a cAMP growth-stimulated PKD phenotype can be caused by decreased intracellular calcium. In normal renal epithelial cells, as in many cell types, cAMP treatment decreases ERK activation (47Stork P.J. Schmi"
https://openalex.org/W2129656837,"Target-derived cues promote local differentiation of axons into nerve terminals at sites of synaptic contact. Using clustering of synaptic vesicles in cultured neurons as an assay, we purified putative target-derived presynaptic organizing molecules from mouse brain and identified FGF22 as a major active species. FGF7 and FGF10, the closest relatives of FGF22, share this activity; other FGFs have distinct effects. FGF22 is expressed by cerebellar granule cells during the period when they receive synapses. Its receptor, FGFR2, is expressed by pontine and vestibular neurons when their axons (mossy fibers) are making synapses on granule cells. Neutralization of FGF7, -10, and -22 inhibits presynaptic differentiation of mossy fibers at sites of contact with granule cells in vivo. Inactivation of FGFR2 has similar effects. These results indicate that FGF22 and its relatives are presynaptic organizing molecules in the mammalian brain and suggest new functions for this family of signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2159861974,"The Sox2 transcription factor is expressed early in the stem cells of the blastocyst inner cell mass and, later, in neural stem cells. We previously identified a Sox2 5'-regulatory region directing transgene expression to the inner cell mass and, later, to neural stem cells and precursors of the forebrain. Here, we identify a core enhancer element able to specify transgene expression in forebrain neural precursors of mouse embryos, and we show that the same core element efficiently activates transcription in inner cell mass-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. Mutation of POU factor binding sites, able to recognize the neural factors Brn1 and Brn2, shows that these sites contribute to transgene activity in neural cells. The same sites are also essential for activity in ES cells, where they bind different members of the POU family, including Oct4, as shown by gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation with anti-Oct4 antibodies. Our findings indicate a role for the same POU binding motifs in Sox2 transgene regulation in both ES and neural precursor cells. Oct4 might play a role in the regulation of Sox2 in ES (inner cell mass) cells and, possibly, at the transition between inner cell mass and neural cells, before recruitment of neural POU factors such as Brn1 and Brn2."
https://openalex.org/W2171103867,"In smokers' lungs, excessive mucus clogs small airways, impairing respiration and promoting recurrent infection. A breakthrough in understanding this pathology was the realization that smoke could directly stimulate mucin synthesis in lung epithelial cells and that this phenomenon was dependent on the cell surface receptor for epidermal growth factor, EGFR. Distal steps in the smoke-triggered pathway have not yet been determined. We report here that the predominant airway mucin (MUC5AC) undergoes transcriptional up-regulation in response to tobacco smoke; this is mediated by an AP-1-containing response element, which binds JunD and Fra-2. These transcription factors require phosphorylation by upstream kinases JNK and ERK, respectively. Whereas ERK activation results from the upstream activation of EGFR, JNK activation is chiefly EGFR-independent. Our experiments demonstrated that smoke activates JNK via a Src-dependent, EGFR-independent signaling cascade initiated by smoke-induced reactive oxygen species. Taken together with our earlier results, these data indicate that the induction of mucin by smoke is the combined effect of mutually independent, reactive oxygen species activation of both EGFR and JNK. In smokers' lungs, excessive mucus clogs small airways, impairing respiration and promoting recurrent infection. A breakthrough in understanding this pathology was the realization that smoke could directly stimulate mucin synthesis in lung epithelial cells and that this phenomenon was dependent on the cell surface receptor for epidermal growth factor, EGFR. Distal steps in the smoke-triggered pathway have not yet been determined. We report here that the predominant airway mucin (MUC5AC) undergoes transcriptional up-regulation in response to tobacco smoke; this is mediated by an AP-1-containing response element, which binds JunD and Fra-2. These transcription factors require phosphorylation by upstream kinases JNK and ERK, respectively. Whereas ERK activation results from the upstream activation of EGFR, JNK activation is chiefly EGFR-independent.

Taken together with our earlier results, these data indicate that the induction of mucin by smoke is the combined effect of mutually independent, reactive oxygen species activation of both EGFR and JNK. The primary cause of morbidity in chronic bronchitis is mucin overproduction, a phenomenon for which the molecular pathogenesis is unknown. Inflammatory cells are abundant in smokers' airways (1Elliot J.G. Jensen C.M. Mutavdzic S. Lamb J.P. Carroll N.G. James A.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

In addition, however, smoke itself can induce mucin synthesis in lung cells (8Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. Mc-Namara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

The question of how this occurs is complex in that smoke, a composite of irritant molecules including acetaldehyde, hydroquinone, formaldehyde, benzo-[a]pyrene, cresol, nicotine, catechol, acrolein, coumarin, anthracene, nitrogen oxides, and heavy metals (10Smith C.J.

Toxicol. 2000; 38: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) may act on lung epithelial cells in diverse ways. For example, the induction of cytochrome P450 by tobacco smoke (12Gebremichael A. Tullis K. Denison M. Cheek J. Pinkerton K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 76-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is mediated by binding of the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor to a dioxin response element in the 5′-flank of the gene, but the induction of the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit (γ-GCSHS) gene is mediated by the binding of a c-Jun/c-Jun homodimer to an AP-1-like response element (13Rahman I. Smith C.A. Lawson M.F. Harrison D.J. MacNee W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Previous reports have implicated the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SFM, serum-free medium; ROS, reactive oxygen species; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RXR, retinoid X receptor; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase.1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SFM, serum-free medium; ROS, reactive oxygen species; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RXR, retinoid X receptor; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase. in the induction of mucin gene MUC5AC by smoke (9Takeyama K. Jung B. Shim J.J. Burgel P.R. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Protin U. Kroschel P. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L165-L172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for EGFR in mucin induction, an EGF response element has been identified 200 bp upstream of the MUC5AC gene (14Perrais M. Pigny P. Copin M.C. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The response of this element to EGFR ligands EGF and transforming growth factor-α is mediated by Sp1. One might predict from these data that the induction of MUC5AC by smoke would depend on interaction between the EGF response element at -200 bp and Sp1. In contrast, in the present study we show that MUC5AC is controlled principally by a smoke response element ∼3 kb upstream of the EGF response element. This element is AP-1-dependent and is bound by JunD/Fra-2 heterodimers. Such heterodimers typically require both JNK and ERK kinases for transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that the ability of smoke to stimulate MUC5AC through AP-1 strongly depends on both JNK and ERK. Although ERK activation was a consequence of EGFR activation, JNK activation was not. Instead, JNK activation by smoke was mediated by Src in an EGFR-independent manner triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). The results indicate that both EGFR-dependent and independent mechanisms cooperate to stimulate mucin production in response to tobacco smoke. Reagents—The chemical inhibitors AG1478 and PP2 were obtained from Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, Inc. La Jolla, CA). SP600125 was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Recombinant human EGF was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Antibodies specific to JunD, Fra-2, and Src were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The antibody specific to phospho-Src was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The JNK1 dominant negative mutant was a gift from Dr. Roger Davis (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Worcester, MA). In Situ Hybridization—Human smoker or non-smoker bronchial tissue was obtained at autopsy from pathologist Dr. Walt Finkbeiner (University of California San Francisco). The tissues were rinsed in sterile PBS to remove secretions and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and placed on prepared slides. Labeled RNA probes were prepared by incorporating [35S]UTP into MUC5AC-specific sense and antisense transcripts using T3 and T7 polymerases. Hybridizations were performed as described previously (15Dohrman A. Tsuda T. Escudier E. Cardone M. Jany B. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Exp. Lung Res. 1994; 20: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and rinsed in PBS for 5 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After being rinsed twice in PBS, they were treated with 20 μg/ml Pronase in TE (1 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 7.5 min. The fixation step was repeated for 5 min, and the slides were rinsed twice in PBS. The sections were acetylated in acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5), rinsed, and dehydrated through ethanol. Sections were hybridized in 50% deionized formamide, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and a final probe concentration of 1 × 104 cpm/μl overnight at 50 °C. After hybridization, sections were rinsed in 50% deionized formamide, 2× SSC (NaCl, Na citrate), 0.1 m dithiothreitol for 30 min at 65 °C and then three times for 10 min each in 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C. After treatment with RNase A (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, the sections were rinsed in 2× SSC, 15 min at 37 °C, and 0.1× SSC, 15 min at 37 °C, and dehydrated. Autoradiography was performed using Ilford K.5 nuclear research emulsion (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Cell Culture—NCI-H292 cells (lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma) and BEAS-2B cells (normal bronchial epithelial cells, virus transformed) were maintained in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum with 100 units/liter penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. HM3 cells (colon carcinoma) were maintained in DME-H21 with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics as above. Most experiments were done in NCI-H292 cells. The exceptions are indicated in the figure legends. Preparation of Smoke-containing Medium—Smoke particulates were generated in specially designed animal exposure chambers operated by Dr. Kent Pinkerton at the University of California, Davis (16Teague S. Pinkerton K.E. Goldsmith M. Gebremichael A. Chang S. Inhal. Toxicol. 1994; 6: 79-93Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Pallflex® borosilicate filters (Pall Gelman, East Hills, NY) were inserted in line during the operation of the chambers. Total suspended smoke particles deposited on each filter were calculated by weighing filters before and after smoke exposure. Filters were mailed to our laboratory where they were stored at 4 °C until use. Prior to each experiment, we incubated filters for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a volume of serum-free medium (SFM) to provide a final concentration of 1.0 mg of smoke particulate per ml of SFM, diluted as needed. Luciferase Assay—Epithelial cells were seeded at 35,000 cells/cm2 in 48-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. Transfections were performed using 0.2 μg of DNA/well and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 1:6 for 18 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum without antibiotics. Cells were recovered in low serum medium RPMI 1640 containing 1% fetal calf serum and antibiotics for 6 h. For smoke exposure, cells were incubated in smoke-containing medium at the indicated concentrations for 1 h and then chased in low serum medium for 18 h. The plates were rinsed once in PBS, lysed in 100-150 μl of luciferase lysis buffer, and frozen at -80 °C until read in a Monolight 2010 luminometer. Cloning and Generation of Deletion/Mutation Constructs—The 5′-flanking region of the human MUC5AC gene was cloned as described previously (17Li D. Gallup M. Fan N. Szymkowski D.E. Basbaum C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6812-6820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′ sequence of the human gastric mucin cDNA HGM-1 (18Klomp L. van Rens L. Strous G. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to obtain the transcription start site of the hMUC5AC gene using repetitive rounds of RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends)-PCR. Using primers from the 5′-untranslated region, genomic DNA was amplified from DNA provided in the human PromoterFinder™ DNA walking kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Approximately 3.7 kb of the 5′-flanking region of the human MUC5AC gene was obtained, sequenced, and cloned into pGL3-Basic luciferase vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The nucleotide sequence of the MUC5AC flanking region is available in the GenBank™ data base under accession number AF016834. Deletion constructs were obtained by combining restriction digestion with PCR using gene-specific primers. Internal mutations were made by PCR amplification using primers containing the mutant sequence. The resulting fragments were cloned into pGL3-Basic vector. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Gel (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift) Assay—Nuclear extracts from NCI-H292 cells were prepared using the NE-PER® nuclear extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prior to extraction, serum-deprived cells were exposed to smoke-containing or control medium. The protein concentration of the cell extract was determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Various double-stranded oligonucleotide probes as indicated in each experiment were synthesized on the basis of the results of luciferase assay experiments described under “Results.” Oligonucleotides were labeled by [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on a MicroSpin™ Sephadex G-25 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min with nuclear extract (5-10 μg of protein) in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 4% (v/v) glycerol. For cold competition assays, a 25-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction and incubated for 30 min on ice before adding radiolabeled probe. For supershift analysis, 1 μl of the antibody of interest (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture preincubated as described above. Samples were applied to polyacrylamide gels under native conditions in high ionic strength buffer. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C for 2-12 h with double intensifying screens. Phospho-JNK Translocation by Immunofluorescence—Human immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were grown on glass coverslips and synchronized in low (1%) serum. The cells were incubated for 20 min in the presence or absence of smoke-containing medium. The cells were then washed with cold PBS, fixed in methanol: acetone (50:50), permeabilized, and immunoreacted with antibody specific to phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185). The phospho-JNK was visualized with Cy3 conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) prior to viewing with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope using an NCF Fluor 40 objective lens. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR in Cultured Cells—The expression of MUC5AC by human lung epithelial cells was assessed after stimulation with serum-free medium or smoke-containing medium for 1 h followed by low serum medium for 18 h. QuantumRNA™ 18 S Classic II Internal Standards (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) were used as the endogenous standards and were amplified in the same linear range, at the same level, and under the same conditions as the MUC5AC mRNA with forward primer (5′-CACTTCTCAACGTTTGACGGGAAG-3′) (+1350) and reverse primer (5′-GTGCTGAGCATACTTCTCATTCTC-3′) (+1893). Starting with 2.0 μg of total RNA for each sample, RT-PCR was carried out using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer, with random hexamer primers. A total of 100 ng of RNA served as a template for PCR with 400 nm forward and reverse MUC5AC primers added to pre-mixed Ready-To-Go™ PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) on ice for a final volume of 25 μl. QuantumRNA 18S Classic II Internal Standards were used as controls. The endogenous standards were amplified in the same linear range, at the same level, and under the same conditions as the MUC5AC mRNA. After reaching a denaturing temperature of 94 °C, tubes were added and cycled 39 times using 94 °C for 30 s to denature, 59 °C for 30 s to anneal, and 72 °C for 30 s to extend. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Animal Exposures to Tobacco Smoke and PCR Analysis—All procedures involving animals were consistent with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were reviewed and approved by the animal welfare committee of the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Albuquerque, NM. Male F344/Crl rats were obtained at 8-9 weeks of age (CDF (F344)/CrlBR rats, Charles River Laboratories, Raleigh, NC). Animals were placed one per cage into whole-body inhalation chambers (H2000, Laboratory Products, Maywood, NJ) and supplied with filtered air for quarantine and conditioning. The chambers were maintained at 12 air changes/hour at a temperature of 24 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 40-70%. Rats were randomly assigned by weight to experimental groups. Exposure to cigarette smoke for 10 days was begun when the animals were 11-13 weeks old. Diluted mainstream cigarette smoke was generated from 1R3 research cigarettes (Tobacco and Health Research Institute, Lexington, KY) by modified AMESA Type 1300 automated smoking machines (AMESA, Geneva, Switzerland) as described previously (19Chen B. Bechtold W. Mauderly J. J. Aerosol. Med. 1992; 5: 19-30Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cigarettes were held at 24 °C and 50-70% relative humidity before use and then puffed twice per minute at a 70-ml puff volume taken over 2 s. Each cigarette was puffed 6-7 times; the fresh smoke was diluted with filtered air and delivered to the exposure chambers. The mass concentration of cigarette smoke total particulate matter (TPM) was determined gravimetrically, CO concentrations were measured periodically using an infrared analyzer (Beckman Industries), and smoke particulate size was measured by cascade impaction. Exposures were conducted daily for 6 h/day for 10 days to a target cigarette smoke concentration of 250 mg TPM/m3. Filtered air controls were held in a separate chamber in the same room. At the end of the exposure the right lung (fifth generation bronchi) was dissected, and total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol method (20Chomczynski P. Sachi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed as described previously (21Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the following primers: 5′-GGTACCCAGGTCTACACCTACTC-3′, rat MUC5AC forward primer; 5′-CATCATTCCTGTAGCAGTAGTGAGG-3′, rat MUC5AC reverse primer; 5′-CTGGAGAAACCTGCCAAGTATGAT-3′, rat GAPDH forward primer; 5′-TTCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTA-3′, rat GAPDH reverse primer. Western Blot—Cell lysates were prepared by adding 500 μl of lysis buffer directly to cells plated in a 6-well plate. Equal amounts of lysate were sonicated for 30 s on ice, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. For immunoblot analysis, 10 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 V for 1 h. Immuno-staining was done by routine methods as instructed by the manufacturer using specific antibodies as indicated. JNK Assay—JNK activity was assayed using the SAPK/JNK assay system (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions. NCI-H292 cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were treated as indicated. The cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, scraped, and sonicated four times for 5 s. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation. Lysates (250 μl) were incubated with a c-Jun fusion protein linked to agarose beads to pull down SAPK enzyme. The beads were washed and then incubated with kinase buffer and 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C to allow SAPK phosphorylation of the c-Jun substrate. Phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) antibody was used to measure SAPK/JNK activity by immunoblotting. MUC5AC Mucin Is Up-regulated by Smoke in Vivo and in Vitro—The effects of smoke on lung mucus production are evident from clinical findings showing that mucus volume increases from several milliliters/day in the airways of healthy individuals to several hundred milliliters/day in smokers with chronic bronchitis (22Coles S.J. Levine L.R. Reid L. Am. J. Pathol. 1979; 94: 459-471PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bhaskar K.R. O'Sullivan D.D. Seltzer J. Rossing T.H. Drazen J.M. Reid L.M. Exp. Lung Res. 1985; 9: 289-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Jeffery P.K. Reid L.M. J. Pathol. 1981; 133: 341-3591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Thurlbeck W.M. Thorax. 1994; 49: 1276-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Mucin, the principal macromolecular component of mucus, is encoded by a family of genes of which MUC5AC appears to be the most highly expressed in the human lung (26Hovenberg H.W. Davies J.R. Carlstedt I. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We found MUC5AC mRNA levels to be greatly elevated in the lungs of human smokers, as measured by in situ hybridization (Fig. 1A). The direct application of smoke to human lung cells essentially reproduced this phenomenon in culture (Fig 1B). Moreover, we could mimic this phenomenon in rats by exposing them to smoke for 10 days in specially designed chambers (19Chen B. Bechtold W. Mauderly J. J. Aerosol. Med. 1992; 5: 19-30Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 1C show that whereas MUC5AC mRNA was undetectable in lung homogenates from 5 individual rats exposed to filtered air, it was clearly visible in 4 of 5 rats exposed to tobacco smoke. These increases in steady state MUC5AC mRNA (Fig. 1, A-C) could have resulted from increased transcription or increased stability of the mRNA or both. To examine the possibility of transcriptional control, we transfected into human lung cells a luciferase reporter gene driven by 3700 nucleotides of the human MUC5AC 5′-flanking sequence. Upon exposure of the transfected cells to smoke extract, we observed an ∼7-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1D), indicating that smoke induces MUC5AC at the level of transcription. Despite the involvement of EGFR in the induction of MUC5AC by smoke (8Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. Mc-Namara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Takeyama K. Jung B. Shim J.J. Burgel P.R. Dao-Pick T. Ueki I.F. Protin U. Kroschel P. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L165-L172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), saturating concentrations of EGF (25-500 ng/ml) evoked a relatively small (2.5-fold) response (Fig. 1D) in agreement with Perrais et al. (14Perrais M. Pigny P. Copin M.C. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The EGFR ligands transforming growth factor-α and amphiregulin elicited responses of similarly small magnitude (not shown). The Induction of MUC5AC by Smoke Is Mediated by AP-1 Sites—To better understand the smoke induction mechanism, we used deletion mutagenesis to map smoke response elements upstream of MUC5AC. Although preliminary studies revealed weak responsiveness within 941 nucleotides of the transcription start site (containing the EGF response element at -202 (14Perrais M. Pigny P. Copin M.C. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32258-32267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)), the major response element was at -3700/-3337 (Fig. 2A). The DNA fragment containing this element was critical for the MUC5AC response to smoke but not for its response to EGF (Fig. 2B). Reference to standard data bases revealed four major transcription factor binding sites in this region: two AP-1 sites (TGACTCA), one RXR site (TGTTCAGAGGTCA), and one NFκB site (GGGGCACTCCCC) (Fig. 2C). Mutations targeting each of these sites decreased responsiveness of MUC5AC (-3752/+1)-luciferase to smoke, with the greatest effects resulting from mutation of the AP-1 sites (Fig. 2C). Smoke Stimulates JunD and Fra-2 Binding to AP-1 Sites—Pursuing the role of each of these sites, we performed electro-mobility gel shift assays using probes corresponding to each site in the presence and absence of smoke. Specificity was confirmed by the use of cold (unlabeled) probe inhibitors. Clearly, smoke induced protein binding to the proximal AP-1 site (Fig. 3A, left panel). Because of the close proximity of the RXR and distal AP-1 sites (nucleotides -3577/-3571 and -3565/-3553 respectively), it was difficult to construct individual probes. Instead, we constructed a probe containing both sites. This probe underwent smoke-induced protein binding (Fig. 3A, right panel). Appropriate mutagenesis of cold probe competitors showed that mutation of the AP-1 site interfered with competitive binding much more than mutagenesis of the RXR site (Fig. 3B). This was consistent with the functional data shown in Fig. 2C. Together, these gel shifts supported the idea that both AP-1 sites play a critical role in the response to smoke. AP-1 motifs (also known as TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) response elements) commonly bind either Jun homodimers or Jun/Fos heterodimers. Although the varying quality and affinity of antibodies for Jun and Fos family members (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, Fra-1, and Fra-2) make it difficult to quantitatively assess the importance of each specific protein, our supershift assays indicated that smoke stimulated both JunD and Fra-2 to bind to the distal AP-1 site (Fig 3B). Smoke not only activated existing pools of JunD and Fra-2 but also stimulated synthesis of these early response genes, as shown by increased levels of each protein in cultured lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3C). Smoke also seemed to alter protein binding to the NFκB site. Although the site is occupied by proteins under control conditions, smoke seems to increase the relative abundance of certain of these proteins, as reflected by increased intensity of the lower band in Fig 3D. Role of JNK and ERK—The information regarding JunD and Fra-2 suggested potential upstream signaling mechanisms. In particular, Jun family members are stimulated in a JNK-dependent manner via phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues in their N-terminal regions (27Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar, 28Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M. Nature. 1991; 354: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), whereas Fos family members are activated by ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Ser or Thr in their C-terminal region (29Murakami M. Ui M. Iba H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our supershift data implicating JunD and Fra-2 in the smoke response, it seemed likely that both JNK and ERK would be stimulated by smoke and required for MUC5AC responsiveness. Indeed, Western blots measuring ERK and JNK phosphorylation (activation) showed activation of both kinases; this peaked at 5-15 min after the onset of smoke exposure (Fig. 4, A and B). Immunofluorescence imaging extended these results by showing that smoke not only induced the phosphorylation of JNK but also its migration into the nucleus (Fig. 4C), a prerequisite for transcriptional activation through AP-1. Smoke-induced phosphorylation of JNK and ERK suggested that these two kinases might participate in the induction of MUC5AC in lung cells. To investigate this possibility, we manipulated JNK and ERK activity and assessed the effects of these treatments on the responsiveness of MUC5AC to smoke. Using a dominant negative JNK mutant, we observed a major reduction in both the MUC5AC-luciferase response to smoke (Fig. 5A) and the response of the endogenous mucin gene (Fig. 5B). The JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125 caused a similar effect (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, this inhibitor had no effect on the modest induction of MUC5AC by EGF (Fig. 5C), supporting the idea that the smoke and EGF induction mechanisms differ. Based on the role of ERK in both activating (30Gruda M.C. Kovary K. Metz R. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2537-2547PubMed Google Scholar) and inducing (31Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

A decrease in the amount of subunit e induces a decrease in the amount of subunit g, but a decrease in the amount of subunit g does not affect subunit e. The loss of subunit e or g leads to the loss of supramolecular structures of ATP synthase, which is fully reversible upon removal of doxycycline.

F0F1-ATP synthase is a molecular rotary motor that is responsible for aerobic synthesis of ATP. It exhibits a head piece (catalytic sector), a base piece (membrane sector), and two connecting stalks. The sector F1 containing the head piece is a water-soluble unit that retains the ability to hydrolyze ATP when in soluble form. F0 is embedded in the membrane and is mainly composed of hydrophobic subunits forming a specific proton-conducting pathway. When the F1 and F0 sectors are coupled, the enzyme functions as a reversible H+-transporting ATPase or ATP synthase (1Fillingame R.H.

Among these additional subunits not present in bacterial and chloroplast ATP synthases, subunits e and g are not involved in ATP synthesis function but are involved in the dimerization/oligomerization of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (13Arnold I.

Subunits e and g are small hydrophobic proteins with an Nin-Cout orientation in the inner mitochondrial membrane (12Arnold I. Bauer M.F. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

Subunit e can form homodimers upon oxidation via its unique cysteine residue (17Brunner S. Everard-Gigot V. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48484-48489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that the transmembrane span contains a conserved GXXXG membranous dimerization motif that is essential for the stability of supramolecular structures of the yeast ATP synthase (18Arselin G.

Biochem. 2003; 270: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, mutant mitochondria devoid of either subunit e or g were found to have numerous digitations and onion-like structures, thus suggesting a link between dimerization/oligomerization of the ATP synthase and cristae morphology (15Paumard P.

Because these alterations in the inner structure of mitochondria were observed on mutant cells grown for at least 30 generations after inactivation of the genes, it was important to check mitochondrial morphology during modulation of the expression of the genes encoding subunits e and g. In the present work the expression of the TIM11 (ATP21) and ATP20 genes encoding subunits e and g, respectively, was modulated by using a tetracycline-regulatable promoter system (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The addition of the tetracycline derivative, doxycycline, in the growth medium decreased the amount of subunits e and g efficiently and led to the loss of supramolecular structures of ATP synthase and an alteration of the cristae morphology, two features that were reversible upon removal of doxycycline.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Doxycycline was purchased from ICN Biochemicals Inc. All other reagents were of reagent grade quality.Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The S. cerevisiae strain D273–10B/A/H/U (MATα, met6, ura3, his3) (22Paul M.F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guérin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was the wild type strain. The null mutants ΔTIM11 and ΔATP20 were constructed by a PCR-based mutagenesis, and the kanr gene was removed (23Güldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar).The TIM11 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned in BamHI and PstI sites of the pCM189 vector (21Gari E.

The PvuII fragments containing TIM11 and ATP20 genes of the resulting vectors were purified and ligated in the integrative vector pRS303 cleaved by EcoRV. The integrative vectors were cleaved by NheI and inserted in the his 3 locus of the respective null mutants ΔTIM11 and ΔATP20, thus resulting in tetO 1The abbreviations used are: tetO, tetracycline operator; BN-PAGE, blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. -TIM11 and tetO-ATP20 strains, respectively.Biochemical Procedures—Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a complete liquid medium containing 2% lactate as the carbon source (24Arselin de Chateaubodeau G.

The rho– cell production in cultures was measured on glycerol plates supplemented with 0.1% glucose. Mitochondria were isolated from cells, grown with or without doxycycline, and harvested at an A550nm of 2–3 corresponding to the logarithmic growth phase. They were prepared from protoplasts as described previously (25Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Protein amounts were determined according to Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

The ATPase activity with and without oligomycin was measured at pH 8.4 in the presence of 0.375% Triton X-100 to remove the endogenous inhibitor of F1 (27Velours J. Vaillier J. Paumard P.

Nitrocellulose membranes (membrane protean BA83, 0.2 μm from Schleicher & Schuell) were used. Polyclonal antibodies against subunits e and g were raised against amino acid residues 69–82 and 31–45, respectively. Antibodies against subunits e, g, and i were used with dilutions of 1:10,000. Membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies and visualized with the ECL reagent of Amersham Biosciences. Molecular mass markers (BenchMark Prestained Protein Ladder) were from Invitrogen. BN-PAGE experiments were conducted as described previously (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.1 ml of digitonin solution with the indicated digitonin to protein ratios. The extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 40,000 × g and aliquots (40 μl) were loaded on the top of a 3–13% polyacrylamide slab gel. After electrophoresis the gel was incubated in a solution of 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% lead acetate, 50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.4, to reveal the ATPase activity (33Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H.

Preparation of mitochondria for electron microscopy was as follows. The mitochondrial pellets were suspended at 4 °C in the isolation buffer containing 1% glutaraldehyde for 1 h and then 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h. Mitochondria were washed at 4 °C with the isolation buffer and then with 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in 0.6 m mannitol. The samples were incubated overnight at 0 °C with 1% osmic tetroxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The samples were washed with cold water, stained for 1 h in 2% uranyl acetate at 4 °C, embedded in 1% agarose, dehydrated progressively with acetone, and infiltrated with Araldite. Grids were examined at 120 kV using a Philips Tecnai 12 Biotwin microscope.RESULTSThe Decrease in the Amount of Subunits e and g Destabilizes the Supramolecular Structures of the Yeast ATP Synthase—To modulate the expression of the TIM11 and ATP20 genes that encode subunits e and g, respectively, we used an expression system in which transcription was driven by a hybrid tetO-CYC11 promoter through the action of a tetR-VP16 activator (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). With this system, expression from the promoter is regulated by tetracycline or derivatives such as doxycycline that are added to the medium currently used to grow yeast cells.The growth of the wild type and respective mutant cells was followed during a 10-h period after doxycycline addition. The doubling time was not affected by the presence of doxycycline in the growth medium, which contained lactate as a non-fermentable carbon source (Table I). We have previously reported that null mutants in either TIM11 or ATP20 genes converted into rho– cells with high frequency (15Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Indeed, the rho– conversion occurred only after a long incubation period (20 h) with doxycycline (Table I).Table IPhenotypic analyses of the yeast strains usedDoubling timerho- cells in culturesStrains-Doxycycline+Doxycycline-Doxycycline+Doxycycline10 h20 hminmin%%%Wild type160 ± 6150 ± 52.72.22.8tetO-TIM11190 ± 8206 ± 60.30.78tetO-ATP20203 ± 17216 ± 20.70.716 Open table in a new tab The repression of the TIM11 gene was followed as a function of time in the presence of doxycycline in the growth medium. tetO-TIM11 cells were harvested, the cell pellets were treated as described in Egner et al.

Subunit i, a membranous component of the yeast ATP synthase, was used as control. A fast decrease in the amount of subunit e was observed in the presence of doxycycline, whereas the subunit i amount was not modified (Fig. 1A). Although the ATP20 gene encoding subunit g was not dependent on doxycycline, the amount of subunit g also decreased in the same way as subunit e (Fig. 1B), which is in agreement with previous observations showing the loss of subunit g in mutants either devoid of subunit e (13Arnold I. Pfieffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or altered in the putative membranous dimerization domain of subunit e (18Arselin G. Giraud M.F. Dautant A. Vaillier J. Brèthes D. Coulary-Salin B. Schaeffer J. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Mitochondria were prepared from tetO-TIM11 cells grown with or without doxycycline. Western blot analyses showed also a simultaneous decrease in the amounts of subunits e and g at the mitochondrial level and no decrease in the amount of the control protein, subunit i (data not shown). In a control experiment, mitochondria were isolated from the wild type cells grown for 20 h in the presence or in the absence of doxycycline. From Western blot analyses no decrease in the amount of nuclear encoded subunits e, i, and g and mitochondrially encoded protein subunit 6 (another component of F0) was observed upon incubation with the antibiotic (Fig. 2, A–C), indicating that doxycycline at the concentration used in the culture medium did not alter the mitochondrial protein synthesis in a wild type context. Consequently, the decrease in the amounts of subunits e and g reported in Fig. 1 was the result of the decrease in the expression of the TIM11 gene.Fig. 2Western blot analyses of mitochondrial proteins prepared from wild type and tetO-ATP20 cells grown in the presence of doxycycline. Mitochondria were prepared from wild type cells grown with (+) or without (–) doxycycline (dox.) for 20 h (A–C) and from tetO-ATP20 cells grown with (+) or in the absence (–) of doxycycline for the indicated times (D and E). 25 μg of mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by Western blot. The blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against subunits e and i (A and E), against subunit g (B), against subunit 6 (C) and against subunits g and i (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The ATP20 gene that encodes subunit g was also made dependent on doxycycline. Mitochondria were prepared from tetO-ATP20 cells grown for 4, 10, and 20 h in the presence of the antibiotic. By Western blot analyses (Fig. 2, D and E) only a faint band corresponding to subunit g was still present in mitochondria after 10 and 20 h of growth with doxycycline. In contrast to the observed decrease in the amounts of subunits e and g induced by the attenuated expression of subunit e, the progressive decrease in the subunit g amount had no effect on the presence of subunit e. This result was expected because as reported previously, the loss of subunit g in ΔATP20 cells did not alter the presence of subunit e (13Arnold I. Pfieffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). A 21.4-kDa band was present in Fig 2E. This band corresponds to a homodimer of subunit e resulting from the formation of a disulfide bond between two subunits e and involving the Cys-28, which is located in the intermembrane space (17Brunner S. Everard-Gigot V. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48484-48489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that such a band pre-exists in the absence of oxidizing agent in mitochondrial membranes of mutants devoid of subunit g, thus showing an alteration of the environment of subunit e by the loss of subunit g (18Arselin G. Giraud M.F. Dautant A. Vaillier J. Brèthes D. Coulary-Salin B. Schaeffer J. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The involvement of subunits e and g in the formation of supramolecular structures of ATP synthase has been reported previously (13Arnold I. Pfieffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE analyses of mitochondrial digitonin extracts prepared from tetO-TIM11 cells grown for 2, 6, and 12 h in the presence of doxycycline are shown in Fig. 3. The positions of F1 and ATP synthase in the gel are indicated by the white bands resulting from the precipitation of lead phosphate upon incubation of the slab gel with ATP and lead acetate. In this experiment, digitonin to protein ratios of 0.75 and 1.5 g/g were chosen to extract the membranous proteins. With such ratios, F1F0 oligomer, F1F0 dimers, F1F0 monomer, and F1 are clearly observed. The two bands migrating at an acrylamide concentration of 6% correspond to the dimeric form of the enzyme. Why the dimeric form is a doublet is not clear. It could correspond to different associations of ATP synthases or different compositions in subunits and associated lipids. The rationale in the experiment of Fig. 3 was to detect the presence of oligomeric forms of the ATP synthase by using a digitonin to protein ratio of 0.75 g/g and the presence of the dimeric and the monomeric forms of the enzyme by using a digitonin to protein ratio of 1.5 g/g. As shown previously, the high detergent to protein ratio removes subunits e and g, leading to the dissociation of the supramolecular structures of the wild type ATP synthase, which converts to the monomeric form (13Arnold I. Pfieffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Thus, with a digitonin to protein ratio of 1.5 g/g to extract the ATP synthase, the densitometric analyses of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel indicated that 16% of the ATP synthase was in the monomeric form in the control experiment (without doxycycline). After 2 h of growth in the presence of doxycycline, oligomeric forms of ATP synthase were still present at a digitonin/protein ratio of 0.75 g/g, and 70% of the ATP synthases were in the dimeric forms at a digitonin/protein ratio of 1.5 g/g. 30–35% and only 5% of ATP synthases were in the dimeric forms after 6 and 12 h of growth with doxycycline, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes showing the digitonin/protein ratio of 1.5 g/g) and no oligomeric form was present (Fig. 3. lanes showing the digitonin/protein ratio of 0.75 g/g).Fig. 3The decrease in the expression level of subunit e leads to the loss of supramolecular structures of the ATP synthase. Mitochondria were prepared from tetO-TIM11 cells grown with (+) or in the absence (–) of doxycycline (dox.) for 2, 6, and 12 h. Mitochondria (500 μg of protein) were incubated with 50 μl of a digitonin solution at the indicated digitonin to protein ratio. After centrifugation, 40 μlofthe supernatant was loaded on the top of a 3–13% polyacrylamide slab gel.

The densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel revealed that with a digitonin to protein ratio of 1.5 g/g, 40% of ATP synthases were in the dimeric forms in the mitochondrial digitonin extract obtained from tetO-ATP20 cells grown for 4 h with doxycycline. With the same digitonin to protein ratio the dimeric forms represented 10 and 6% of the sum of monomeric and dimeric forms present in the mitochondrial digitonin extracts of tetO-ATP20 cells grown for 10 and 20 h with doxycycline, respectively. In addition a high ATPase activity corresponding to free F1 was detected after 20 h of growth with doxycycline, which is in agreement with the spontaneous rho– cell conversion shown in Table I.Fig. 4The decrease in the expression level of subunit g leads to the loss of supramolecular structures of the ATP synthase.

The cells were harvested and grown in the same medium but without doxycycline for 6, 12, and 20 h. Mitochondria were prepared for each incubation time and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 5) and by BN-PAGE (Fig. 6). Clearly, the increase in the amount of subunit e correlates with an increase in the amount of subunit g and in the amount of dimeric and oligomeric forms of ATP synthase, whereas a concomitant decrease in the monomeric form is observed.Fig. 5The removal of doxycycline from the culture medium of tetO-TIM11 cells induces the synthesis of subunit e and allows the presence of subunit g in mitochondrial membranes. Cells were grown with (+) or without (–) doxycycline (dox.) for 12 h and then harvested and incubated in the culture medium without the antibiotic for 6, 12, and 20 h. Mitochondria were prepared, and aliquots (25 μg of protein) were submitted to Western blot analysis. The blots were probed with antibodies against subunits e and i (A) and against subunits g and i (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6The removal of doxycycline from the culture medium of tetO-TIM11 cells allows the presence of supramolecular structures of ATP synthase in mitochondrial digitonin extracts.

The ATPase activity was measured with mitochondria prepared from cells grown in the presence of doxycycline for 6, 12, and 20 h (Fig. 7A). In another experiment, cells grown for 12 h in the presence of doxycycline were harvested and grown again for 6, 12, and 20 h without doxycycline (Fig. 7B). Mitochondria were prepared for each incubation time, and the ATPase activity was measured. A 50% decrease in the total specific activity was found with mitochondria isolated from tetO-TIM11 cells grown with doxycycline for either 12 or 20 h. A decrease in the sensitivity of the ATPase activity toward the F0 inhibitor oligomycin occurred after long incubation periods (20 h) with antibiotic (Fig. 7A). On the other hand, the removal of doxycycline allowed a full recovery of the ATPase activity,"
https://openalex.org/W2013925438,"The nucleosome remodeling factor NURF is a four-subunit, ISWI-containing chromatin remodeling complex that catalyzes nucleosome sliding in an ATP-dependent fashion, thereby modulating the accessibility of the DNA. To elucidate the mechanism of nucleosome sliding, we have investigated by hydroxyl radical footprinting how NURF makes initial contact with a nucleosome positioned at one end of a DNA fragment. NURF binds to two separate locations on the nucleosome: a continuous stretch of linker DNA up to the nucleosome entry site and a region asymmetrically surrounding the nucleosome dyad within the minor grooves, close to residues of the histone H4 tail that have been implicated in the activation of ISWI activity. Kinetic analysis reveals that nucleosome sliding occurs in apparent increments or steps of 10 bp. Furthermore, single nucleoside gaps as well as nicks about two helical turns before the dyad interfere with sliding, indicating that structural stress at this region assists the relative movement of DNA. These findings support a sliding model in which the position-specific tethering of NURF forces a translocating ISWI ATPase to pump a DNA distortion over the histone octamer, thereby changing the translational position of the nucleosome.

The condensation of eukaryotic DNA in chromatin has a significant influence on gene function and metabolism. In the nucleosome core particle, the fundamental unit of chromatin compaction, the wrapping of 146 or 147 bp of DNA in ∼1.7 superhelical turns over a histone octamer, occludes about half of the DNA surface (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar, 2Richmond T.J. Davey C.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), rendering it poorly accessible to macromolecules such as DNA binding regulatory proteins and the transcriptional machinery. To counteract the constraints imposed by chromatin architecture at the nucleosome and higher levels of organization, cells employ two major classes of multiprotein enzymes, which post-translationally modify the nucleosome core histones or catalyze the mobilization of nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent fashion. These enzyme complexes, when targeted onto chromatin, catalyze the reorganization of chromatin structure, thereby affecting major DNA-dependent processes including transcription, DNA repair, and recombination (3Narlikar G.J.

The ATP-dependent class of chromatin remodeling complexes (referred to hereafter as the SWI/SNF family) is highly conserved from fungi to mammals and can be divided phylogenetically into four subgroups on the basis of the catalytic SWI2/SNF2-like subunit, the SWI2/SNF2, ISWI, CHD1 (Mi-2), and INO80 ATPases (3Narlikar G.J.

Bioessays. 2003; 25: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Intensive genetic and biochemical studies of these complexes in a variety of eukaryotic systems have established their widespread functions as important elements of the transcription regulatory apparatus. All complexes of the SWI/SNF family use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to catalyze the mobilization of nucleosomes, in which nucleosomal DNA or the core histones are dislocated in relation to their canonical organization. Despite this general similarity, marked differences exist between family subgroups in the nature and extent of the catalyzed movements of nucleosomal DNA and histones (3Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y.

Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Recently, components of NURF have also been found in the TATA box binding protein-related factor 2 (TRF2) complex that controls promoter-selective expression (17Hochheimer A. Zhou S. Zheng S. Holmes M.C. Tjian R. Nature. 2002; 420: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

NURF, CHRAC, and ACF are ATP-dependent enzymes in vitro, mediating the relative mobilization of nucleosomal DNA without disruption or irretrievable displacement of the histone octamer; this type of nucleosome mobilization is referred to as “nucleosome sliding” (21Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 22Längst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B.

Moreover, the ATPase and nucleosome sliding activities of ISWI complexes are strikingly dependent on specific residues of the N-terminal histone H4 tail, indicating that interaction with histone H4 is a key regulatory step (27Hamiche A.

However, despite substantial knowledge of physiological functions and biochemical activities, important questions regarding structure and mechanism of action of the ISWI complexes remain outstanding. NURF is a four-subunit complex that contains, in addition to the ISWI ATPase, NURF301, a large multifunctional polypeptide (24Xiao H. Sandaltzopoulos R. Wang H.M. Hamiche A. Ranallo R. Lee K.M. Fu D. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), NURF55, a WD-repeat protein also found in other chromatin-associated factors (31Martínez-Balbás M.A. Tsukiyama T. Gdula D. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and NURF38, an inorganic pyrophosphatase (32Gdula D.A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Tsukiyama T. Ossipow V. Wu C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3206-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We have previously reconstituted NURF by co-expression of individual subunits in a baculovirus expression system and shown that ISWI and NURF301 are minimally required for reconstitution of high level nucleosome sliding activity (24Xiao H. Sandaltzopoulos R. Wang H.M. Hamiche A. Ranallo R. Lee K.M. Fu D. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here, we report how NURF assembled with the natural complement of four subunits makes close contact with specific sites of a positioned nucleosome prior to ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding and show that nucleosome mobilization occurs in discrete increments or steps of 10 bp. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of NURF-induced nucleosome sliding. End-labeled DNA—For reconstitution of nucleosomes a 194-bp fragment comprising bp 34-227 of the 601 clone (282 bp) from Lowary and Widom (33Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) was used as a strong nucleosome positioning sequence. The 194-bp fragment was generated by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-TCACACCGAGTTCATCCCTTATGT-3′ (top strand) and 5′-ACAGGATGTATATATCTGACACGT-3′ (bottom strand). All oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG-Biotech (Munich, Germany). For double end labeling of the DNA fragment the same primer modified at the 5′ end with Bodipy 530/550 (top strand) and Bodipy 493/503 (bottom strand) were used. The PCR contained 2 ng of 194-bp fragments as a template, 0.6 mm dNTPs (BD Bioscience), a 5 μm concentration of both primers, and 2 μl of Titanium TaqDNA Polymerase (BD Bioscience) in 1× Titanium TaqPCR buffer (BD Bioscience) in a 100-μl reaction volume. After an initial 2-min denaturation at 95 °C, 25 thermal cycles were performed (30s 95 °C, 30 s 58 °C, 1 min 68 °C) with an additional 5-min extension step at 68 °C. For large scale preparation 20 PCRs were run in parallel, and products were concentrated in Microcon YM-30 concentrators (Millipore) and gel-purified on a native 6% PAGE in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) using the Mini-Prep Cell (Bio-Rad). Elution was tracked by a flow-through UV monitor (UV-1, Amersham Biosciences) using an HR-10 flow cell. Recombinant Histones, Octamer Assembly, and Nucleosome Reconstitution—Recombinant core histones from Drosophila melanogaster were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (27Hamiche A. Kang J.G. Dennis C. Xiao H. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14316-14321Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Histone octamers were assembled and purified as described (34Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Briefly, 90 μmol of each histone in SAU-1000 buffer (7 m urea, 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) were mixed at room temperature for 30 min, and buffer was slowly dialyzed against refolding buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) as decribed (34Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). 500-1000 μg of octamer were purified on a Superdex 200 PC3.2/30 gel filtration column at 4 °C at a flow rate of 40 μl refolding buffer using the SMART System (Amersham Biosciences). Octamer concentration was determined photometrically using 1 A280 = 2.80 mg/ml. In a typical nucleosome reconstitution reaction 80 μg of the doubly end-labeled 194-bp DNA were incubated in a 1:1 ratio (w/w) with the octamer in 100 μl of 2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 ng/μl BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was diluted stepwise to 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 m NaCl using dilution buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 ng/μl BSA) and incubating each step for 10 min at 37 °C. The reconstitution reaction was dialyzed against TE (10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at room temperature, concentrated with Microcon YM-30 concentrators, and the main N1 position gel-purified on a native 6% PAGE using the Mini-Prep Cell as described for the DNA purification. NURF—The four subunits of NURF (NURF301, ISWI, p55, and p38) were co-expressed in Sf9 cell and purified by pull-down of the FLAG-tagged 301 subunit by anti-FLAG antibody beads (Sigma, M2) as described (24Xiao H. Sandaltzopoulos R. Wang H.M. Hamiche A. Ranallo R. Lee K.M. Fu D. Wu C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For the footprint experiments the complex was left on the beads, whereas the complex was eluted by 1 mm 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) for all other experiments. Protein concentration was determined on a SYPRO ruby-stained SDS-PAGE using BSA (Pierce, catalog number 23209) as a reference. Gels were scanned (Typhoon 9410, Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Nucleosome Remodeling Assays—Remodeling assays were essentially performed as described (21Hamiche A. Sandaltzopoulos R. Gdula D.A. Wu C. Cell. 1999; 97: 833-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). For the time course experiment 300 fmol of end-labeled nucleosome were incubated in 10 μl of sliding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with 825 fmol of NURF, and the reaction was started by addition of ATP to a concentration of 1 mm. At the indicated time points 1 μl of the reaction was removed and put into 5 μl of stop solution (12% sucrose, 8 mm γ-S-ATP, 80 ng/μl poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT)). The different reactions were resolved on a native 6% PAGE in 0.5× TBE and fluorescence-scanned using the Typhoon 9410 (488 nm excitation and 526 short path wavelength). Remodeling activity of the anti-FLAG beads bound NURF was tested by incubating 2 μl of beads containing ∼5 pmol of NURF with 0.3, 0.9, or 3 pmol of nucleosomes in presence (+) or absence (-) of 1 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of sliding buffer. The concentrations of nucleosomes and remodeling enzyme used in other experiments are indicated in the respective method or figure legend. Mapping of Nucleosome Positions by Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting—To generate the different nucleosome positions, 8.7 pmol of the purified nucleosome (N1 position) were remodeled by 2.6 pmol of NURF for 1 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of sliding buffer containing 1 mm ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and buffer exchanged to MoMK-50 buffer (10 mm MOPS, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 100 ng/μl BSA (New England Biolabs, pH 7.2)) by adding 500 μl of the buffer, concentrating with a Microcon YM-30, and repeating the procedure an additional time. The volume was adjusted to 50 μl, and the remodeled nucleosomes were digested with hydroxyl radicals (35Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) by placing 0.5 μl of the following solutions to the inner wall of the reaction tube: (i) 20 mm (NH4)2Fe(II)SO4)2 and 40 mm EDTA, (ii) 100 mm sodium ascorbate, and (iii) 0.3% (v/v) H2O2. The reaction was initiated by spinning down the solutions, incubated 1 min at room temperature, and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 100 mm thiourea, 0.5 μl of 500 mm EDTA, and 7 μl of 60% sucrose. The reaction products were resolved on a native 6% PAGE in 0.5× TBE, the region containing the nucleosomes was blotted onto a DEAE membrane (NA45, Schleicher and Schuell), and bands N1-N3 were cut, eluted by 2 m ammonium acetate, and ethanol-precipitated. The DNA was dissolved in sequencing loading buffer (80% deionized formamide, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 2% 5× ClearBand loading buffer (MTR Scientific, LLC) as a loading dye). By scanning the fluorescence of a portion of each reaction approximately the same amounts were loaded onto an 8% sequencing gel containing 7 m urea using a buffer electrolyte-gradient system (36Sheen J.Y. Seed B. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 942-944PubMed Google Scholar) on an S2 sequencing system (Invitrogen). Gels were scanned within the glass plates (non-fluorescent, The Gel Co., model number GGO20L) with a Typhoon 9410 (Amersham Biosciences) using the following settings for excitation and emission wavelength: 488/526 nm short path for detection of the bottom strand and 532/555 ± 15 nm for the top strand. Standards were either generated using the Thermo Sequenase Dye Primer Manual Cycle Sequencing Kit (United States Biochemical Corp.) or with the ABI Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems). In the latter case the bands appearing in the 532/555 nm channel represent a G+A marker. NURF Footprint on Nucleosomal DNA—To capture the ternary complexes of NURF-octamer/DNA, the nucleosomes were pulled down as outlined in Fig. 2. Three μl of anti-FLAG beads containing ∼7.5 pmol of NURF were incubated with 2 μg/μl BSA (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 4 °C in MoMK-80 buffer (same as MoMK-50, but with 80 mm KCl) on a rotator and washed three times with 100 μl of MoMK-80. Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of MoMK-80, and 5.4 pmol of fluorescently end-labeled purified N1 nucleosome was added and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Under the described conditions ∼50% of the nucleosomes are bound by NURF. Both the bound and unbound fractions were digested with hydroxyl radicals within one reaction tube as described under “Mapping of the Nucleosomes by Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting.” The reactions were stopped by addition of 5 μl of thiourea and 0.5 μl of ETDA, and bound and free fractions were separated using the beads. The bound fraction was eluted from the beads by incubation with 2 m ammonium acetate for 1 h on a rotator at room temperature, and all fractions were ethanol-precipitated using 15 μg of linear acrylamide per sample as a carrier. Samples were applied to a sequencing gel and scanned as described above. The quantitative analysis of the footprints was essentially carried out as described previously (37Schwanbeck R. Manfioletti G. Wisniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1793-1801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Borrmann L. Schwanbeck R. Heyduk T. Seebeck B. Rogalla P. Bullerdiek J. Wisniewski J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6841-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor changes using ImageQuant 5.2 (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, fluorescence intensities along the lanes were scanned (lines, 21-pixel width) and imported into the ALIGN software (gift from Dr. T. Heyduk, St. Louis, MO; available on request) to correct distortions of the gel. Aligned intensity plots were imported to EXCEL (Microsoft), the background was subtracted using intensity scans of the inter-lanes, and gel-loading efficiencies and extent of cleavage were normalized. Using the standards the relative mobilities of the bands were transformed into base pair positions. For the difference plots areas under the peaks representing one base pair were integrated and positions bound by NURF and free were compared using the relative cutting frequency, which is defined by (Ibound - Ifree)/Ifree, where Ibound is the integrated intensity at one base pair of the NURF-bound fraction and Ifree is the intensity at that base in the free fraction. The relative cutting frequencies at every single position of seven independent experiments were averaged, and regions of significant protection were calculated according to a Student's t test with a significance level of p = 0.05. Missing Nucleoside and DNA Nick Interference on Sliding—For the missing nucleoside sliding interference assay 16.6 pmol of fluorescently end-labeled purified nucleosomes (N1) were digested with hydroxyl radicals in 100 μl of MoMK-50 buffer as described above but with 1 μl of each hydroxyl radical generating solution. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 μl of glycerol and the buffer exchanged to sliding buffer in two rounds of dilution/concentration using the Microcon YM-30 concentrators (Millipore). Three-fourths of the reaction was subjected to a remodeling reaction with 2.6 pmol of NURF for 30 min at 37 °C in a 30-μl reaction volume containing 1 mm ATP. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and loaded along with sucrose loading buffer onto a native 6% PAGE in 0.5× TBE. One-fourth of the digestion was applied to the gel as “unremodeled” fraction. The DNA of the N1-N3 positions was isolated by electroblotting as described under “Mapping of the Nucleosomes by Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting,” and equal amounts of DNA analyzed were applied on a sequencing gel. For the DNA nick sliding interference assay, 40 μg of 194-bp DNA was partially digested in 1.5 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.6) with 2.3 units of DNase I (Worthington) at room temperature for 80 s. Nucleosomes were assembled and purified as described above. 14.4 pmol of nucleosomes were remodeled by 2.6 pmol of NURF in sliding buffer, and interference was analyzed as described for the missing nucleoside experiment. Projection of Results onto Nucleosome Structure—Regions of the DNA that were shown to be significantly protected in the footprint or interfered in the missing nucleoside interference assay were projected onto the 147-bp 1.9-Å nucleosome (PDB code: 1kx5) (39Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1097-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). To visualize the entry site of the DNA a linker of 18 bp was manually fused to the nucleosome core structure. Therefore, a second PDB file for the 18-bp DNA was generated by the web-based program “model.it” (hydra.icgeb.trieste.it/~kristian/dna/) (40Munteanu M.G. Vlahovicek K. Parthasarathy S. Simon I.

Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar) (us.expasy.org/spdbv/) and bases renumbered according to our 194-bp DNA fragment.

A movie is available in the supplementary data. The fused PDB file and a script to load the structure as shown is available for Protein Explorer and RasMol on request. NURF Moves a Positioned Nucleosome within Seconds—To define the kinetics of nucleosome mobilization catalyzed by NURF in vitro, we analyzed the first detectable movement of a mononucleosome positioned at one end of a 194-bp DNA fragment. A fluorescently end-labeled 194-bp DNA that contains a strong nucleosome positioning sequence (33Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) abutting the right end of the fragment was reconstituted into mononucleosomes with purified histone octamers and incubated with NURF and ATP. Analysis of the repositioned nucleosome by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in which migration of an end-positioned nucleosome is fast relative to centrally positioned nucleosomes (43Duband-Goulet I.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2951-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), shows that the action of NURF moves the terminally positioned nucleosome (N1) to two major locations toward the center of the fragment (N2 and N3) (Fig. 1A). The time course indicates that the N2 position is detectable as early as 3 s after addition of ATP. The amount of the N2 species increases with time, peaking at 200 s of incubation and decreasing thereafter. Hence, the movement from the N1 to N2 position represents the first, apparent translational step taken by the mobilized nucleosome. The N3 nucleosome reaches a maximum level at a later time (500 s) concomitant with depletion of the N2 nucleosome, indicating that the first step to the N2 position is followed by a second step from the N2 to the N3 position (Fig. 1, A and B). Nucleosome Mobilization in 10-bp Steps—To measure the length of the first and second steps of nucleosome movement, we mapped the positions of the N1, N2, and N3 nucleosomes by hydro"
https://openalex.org/W2103911973,"Recently, caspase-2 was shown to act upstream of mitochondria in stress-induced apoptosis. Activation of caspase-8, a key event in death receptor-mediated apoptosis, also has been demonstrated in death receptor-independent apoptosis. The regulation of these initiator caspases, which trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, is unclear. Here we report a potential regulatory role of caspase-2 on caspase-8 during ceramide-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the sequential events of initiator caspase-2 and caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and translocation, and mitochondrial damage followed by downstream caspase-9 and -3 activation and cell apoptosis after ceramide induction in T cell lines. The expression of truncated Bid (tBid) and the reduction in mitochondrial transmembrane potential were blocked by caspase-2 or caspase-8, but not caspase-3, knockdown using an RNA interference technique. Ceramide-induced caspase-8 activation, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis were blocked in caspase-2 short interfering RNA-expressing cells. Therefore, caspase-2 acts upstream of caspase-8 during ceramide-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Similarly, sequential caspase-2 and caspase-8 activation upstream of mitochondria was also observed in etoposide-induced apoptosis. These data suggest sequential initiator caspase-2 and caspase-8 activation in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway induced by ceramide or etoposide.

A mitochondrial apoptotic pathway is required for various death stimuli (1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat.

The regulation of these initiator caspases leading to the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway remains unresolved.Ceramide, a product of sphingolipid metabolism, regulates diverse cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although the role of ceramide as a signaling molecule remains debatable (15Hofmann K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Polverino A.J. Patterson S.D. Gu M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), some early work suggested that various extracellular agents and stress stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), Fas, chemotherapeutic agents, irradiation, and heat, might cause accumulation of ceramide. Ceramide modulates the biochemical and cellular processes that lead to apoptosis (17Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Bourget L. Denis-Larose C. Massie B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5317-5327Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 18Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 19Kolesnick R.

The mechanisms by which ceramide regulates apoptotic events have not been fully defined. Ceramide activates a number of enzymes involved in stress-signaling pathways, including both protein kinases and protein phosphatases. A recent study indicates that ceramide-induced neuronal apoptosis is associated with dephosphorylation of Akt, Bcl2-associated death promoter (BAD), forkhead transcriptional factor (FKHR), and GSK-3β and with induction of the mitochondria-dependent pathway (22Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A. Lea IV, P.M. Faden A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ceramide may induce the activation of caspase-8 and the cleavage of Bid that lead to cytochrome c release and neuronal cell death (23Darios F. Lambeng N. Troadec J.D. Michel P.P. Ruberg M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In our present investigation of the regulation of initiator caspase activation, we used ceramide to induce apoptosis in mouse and human T cell lines because ceramide and its metabolites contribute to the regulation of T cell survival and death (24Adam D. Heinrich M. Kabelitz D. Schutze S. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our study showed that the induction of apoptosis was via caspase-dependent and mitochondria-mediated pathways in T cells. Furthermore, sequential caspase-2 and -8 activation, which occurred upstream of mitochondria, was demonstrated by using caspase inhibitors or via RNA interference. Previous studies have shown that etoposide induces apoptosis via caspase-2 (13Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

In this study, we found that similar to the effect of ceramide, etoposide-induced apoptosis is mediated by sequential caspase-2 and -8 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Reagents—The mouse T hybridoma cell line 10I was kindly provided by Dr. M. Z. Lai, Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan (27Lai M.Z. Ross D.T. Guillet J.G. Briner T.J. Gefter M.L. Smith J.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3973-3980PubMed Google Scholar). The human lymphoid T cell line Jurkat was obtained from Dr. B. C. Yang, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan. These two cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin and were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 and resuspended in hybridoma serum-free medium (Invitrogen) (for 10I cells) or serum-free RPMI (for Jurkat cells) before experiments. Ceramide analogue C2-ceramide (BioMol) and etoposide (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). 1The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; -OMe, methoxy; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; z-LEHD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu(-OMe)-His-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; z-IETD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(-OMe)-Thr-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; z-DEVD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(-OMe)-Glu(-OMe)-Val-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; z-VDVAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp(-OMe)-Val-Ala-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; BA, bongkrekic acid; PI, propidium iodide; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; tBid, truncated Bid; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DiOC6(3Thornberry N.A.

The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk) and caspase-9, -8, -3, and -2 inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu(-OMe)-His-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-LEHD-fmk), benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(-OMe)-Thr-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-IETD-fmk), benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(-OMe)-Glu(-OMe)-Val-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-DEVD-fmk), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp(-OMe)-Val-Ala-Asp(-OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VDVAD-fmk), respectively, were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in Me2SO. Bongkrekic acid (BA) was purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in Me2SO.Analysis of Cell Apoptosis—For apoptosis detection characterized by DNA fragmentation, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline for propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) staining or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction using the ApoAlert DNA fragmentation assay kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). Apoptotic cell membrane disruption characterized by the presence of phosphatidylserine was performed using the annexin V-phycoerythrin detection kit (BioVision).Detection of Caspase Activation—Cellular caspase activation was determined using the ApoAlert caspase colorimetric assay kit (Clontech) for caspase-3 and -8 and an ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit for caspase-9 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Caspase-2 activity was detected using a caspase-2 assay kit (Calbiochem). Optical density (OD) measurements were performed using a microplate reader, and the substrate activities shown as p-nitroanilide (nmol) were calculated for caspase-3, -8, and -9. For caspase-2, the relative substrate activity was shown by the OD values. Caspase-3 activation monitored in cells was performed using PhiPhiLux-G2D2 staining (OncoImmunol) and analyzed by flow cytometry in an FL-2 channel or detected by fluorescent microscopy. The activation of caspases was also detected by Western blot analysis as described below.Western Blot Analysis—To detect cytochrome c release, cytosolic extract without the mitochondrial fraction was separated using an ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect other proteins, total cell lysate was used. Western blotting was then performed (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cell extract was separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking, blots were developed with a series of antibodies as indicated. Rabbit antibodies specific for mouse caspase-2, -3, -8, and -9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and tBid (Oncogene) were used. Monoclonal antibodies against human caspase-2 and -8 (R&D) and β-actin (Sigma) and rabbit antibodies against human caspase-3 and -9 (Cell Signaling Technology) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Finally, blots were hybridized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem) and developed using an AEC substrate kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.).Mitochondrial Functional Assay—The mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) value was determined using rhodamine 123 (Sigma) and 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanide iodide (DiOC6(3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar); Molecular Probes). The activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase was determined by a WST-8 assay kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). For staining on the conformational change of mitochondria, Mito Tracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunostaining—For intracellular immunostaining, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. A series of antibodies was used as indicated, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) staining. Rabbit anti-tBid was used for flow cytometric analysis. For confocal microscopy, rabbit anti-tBid and anti-cytochrome c (Calbiochem) antibodies were used. Mito Tracker Red CMXRos and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole were used for mitochondrial and nuclear staining, respectively.Caspase-2, -3, and -8 Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation— Plasmids expressing short hairpin RNA were constructed using standard techniques. The pSUPER/enhanced GFP (EGFP) contained the GFP gene from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) inserted into the pSUPER vector (28Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Agami, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). To generate pSUPER-Casp2/EGFP, the pSUPER/EGFP was digested with BglII and HindIII, and the annealed targeting oligonucleotides ACAGCTGTTGTTGAGCGAA (14Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) were ligated into the vector. To generate pSUPER-Casp3/EGFP and pSUPER-Casp8/EGFP, the pSUPER/EGFP was digested with BglII and HindIII, and the annealed targeting oligonucleotides TGACATCTCGGTCTGGTAC (29Wurzer W.J. Planz O. Ehrhardt C. Giner M. Silberzahn T. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2717-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and GTTCCTGAGCCTGGACTAC (30Tomar R.S. Matta H. Chaudhary P.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5712-5715Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were ligated into the vector, respectively. The pSUPER-Casp2 (-3 or -8)/EGFP/Neo was generated by inserting the Neor gene from the pIRESneo2 (Clontech) into the pSUPER-Casp2 (-3 or -8)/EGFP vector.Jurkat cells were cultured in 6-well plastic plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Before short hairpin RNA-expression vector transfection, 106 cells were washed with serumfree RPMI and cultured with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of DNA. After 24 h of incubation, cells were then maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 24 h before the experiments. The FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to sort EGFP-positive cells with purity ranging between 86.8 and 92.8% for vector control cells and between 82.3 and 93.9% for caspase-2 siRNA-expressing cells in different experiments and with a purity of 86.8% for caspase-3 siRNA-expressing cells and of 89.7% for caspase-8 siRNA-expressing cells.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCeramide Induces Caspase-dependent and Mitochondria-mediated Apoptosis—We used ceramide to induce apoptosis in 10I T hybridoma cells. The time kinetics of ceramide-induced cell apoptosis were shown by PI staining and TUNEL reaction followed by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1A). Using a caspase activity assay and Western blot analysis, the activity of caspase-9 and -3 (Fig. 1A) and the presence of active forms of caspase-9 (33 kDa) and -3 (17 kDa) and caspase substrate PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B) were observed after exposure to ceramide. Cell death, caspase activation, and PARP cleavage were blocked by z-VAD-fmk pretreatment. In addition, the irreversible caspase-9 and -3 inhibitors z-LEHD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk, respectively, blocked cell apoptosis as compared with Me2SO controls (Fig. 1C). Caspase-9 activity was inhibited by z-VAD-fmk and z-LEHD-fmk but not by z-DEVD-fmk.Using lipophilic cationic fluorochrome (rhodamine 123 and DiOC6(3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar)) staining and WST-8 assay, we found that ceramide induced mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) reduction and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity down-regulation in a time-dependent manner (data not shown). To study whether mitochondrial damage is the essential event involved in the ceramide-mediated apoptotic feature, a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor, bongkrekic acid, was used (22Stoica B.A. Movsesyan V.A. Lea IV, P.M. Faden A.I. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 22: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Petit P.X. Gendron M.C. Schrantz N. Metivier D. Kroemer G. Maciorowska Z. Sureau F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Using rhodamine 123 and PI staining followed by flow cytometric analysis, we found that pretreatment with BA blocked ceramide-induced ΔΨm reduction and cell apoptosis (Fig. 1D). Consistently, both ceramide-induced caspase-9 and -3 activation (Fig. 1D) and cytosolic cytochrome c expression (Fig. 1E) were inhibited by pretreatment with BA. Bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control.

To investigate the mechanisms that regulate initial caspase activation during apoptosis, we first detected the activity of caspase-2 and -8 in ceramide-treated 10I cells. Expression of active caspase-2 and -8 could be observed as early as 1–2 h after ceramide stimulation by caspase activity assay and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). The onset of caspase-2 activity occurred earlier than that of caspase-8 (Fig. 2A, left). However, the caspase-2 cleavage form exhibited a higher level at a later time (Fig. 2A, right). It recently was reported that caspase-2 activation might occur by oligomerization without any significant processing of procaspase-2 (33Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Our data may implicate the activation of caspase-2 at an early stage without marked processing of the precursor, and its cleavage at the late stage may be a result of the activity of caspase-3 as suggested previously (34Swanton E. Savory P. Cosulich S. Clarke P. Woodman P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This hypothesis remains to be tested.Fig. 2Activation of caspase-8 and -2 is required for the ceramideand etoposide-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.A, 10I cells were treated with 40 μm C2-ceramide for various time periods followed by caspase-2 and -8 activity assay and tBid detection. Time kinetics of caspase-2 and -8 activities as quantified by caspase activity assay kits are shown (left). Data presented are the averages of two experimental results. Also, ceramide-induced procaspase-2 and -8 cleavage and tBid expression at different time points were determined by Western blot (right). Protein expression of β-actin was used as an internal control. pNA, p-nitroanilide. B, ceramide and etoposide induce initiator caspase activation-mediated mitochondrial disruption. With or without caspase inhibitors, including z-VAD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk, z-VDVAD-fmk, or z-LEHD-fmk, ΔΨm (MTP) reduction and cell apoptosis were determined by rhodamine 123 and PI staining, respectively. The activities of caspase-9 and -3 were also determined by using caspase activity assay kits. DMSO, Me2SO. C, 10I cells were treated with C2-ceramide for 6 h with or without 10 μm caspase inhibitors z-IETD-fmk or z-VDVAD-fmk. For confocal microscopy analysis, ceramide-treated cells were first stained with Mito Tracker dye as mitochondrial staining. After fixation, cells were incubated with tBid-specific antibody following FITC-labeled secondary antibody and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain. The tBid (green) that translocated to mitochondria (red) is shown in yellow (Merge). D, with or without caspase inhibitors as indicated, 10I cells treated with C2-ceramide for 6 h were detected for tBid expression by flow cytometric analysis. The histogram and the percentages of tBid-positive cells (M1) are shown as marked. E, ceramide-mediated cytosolic cytochrome c expression with or without caspase inhibitors as indicated was determined by Western blot. Protein expression of β-actin was used as an internal control.

The irreversible caspase-2 and -8 inhibitors z-VDVAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk, respectively, were used. Using rhodamine 123 and PI staining followed by flow cytometric analysis, we found that pretreatment with 10 μm z-VDVAD-fmk or z-IETD-fmk for 1 h blocked ceramide-induced ΔΨm reduction and cell apoptosis (Fig. 2B, top). Further results showed that ceramide-induced ΔΨm reduction was blocked by broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk, and caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk but not by caspase-9 inhibitor z-LEHD-fmk, whereas cell apoptosis and caspase-9 and -3 activation were blocked by pretreatment with these caspase inhibitors. These results suggest that ceramide induces mitochondrial apoptosis via a caspase-2and caspase-8-dependent pathway. When cells were treated with etoposide, results were similar to those obtained with cells treated with ceramide (Fig. 2B, bottom), indicating the requirement of caspase-2 and -8 upstream of mitochondria during etoposide-induced apoptosis.Ceramide-induced cell apoptosis via caspase-8 activation recently has been demonstrated (23Darios F. Lambeng N. Troadec J.D. Michel P.P. Ruberg M. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tBid-mediated mitochondrial damage is regulated by caspase-8 activation (5Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

In this study, ceramide-induced tBid expression was shown by Western blot analysis using a tBid-specific antibody (Fig. 2A, right). Further approaches using the tBid-specific antibody in combination with Mito Tracker dye showed the translocation of tBid to mitochondria in ceramide-treated apoptotic cells (Fig. 2C). Also, by flow cytometric analysis, ceramide-enhanced tBid expression was shown (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, Bid cleavage and cytochrome c release after ceramide stimulation were blocked by z-VDVAD-fmk or z-IETD-fmk pretreatment (Fig. 2, C–E). Therefore, activation of initiator caspases, including caspase-2 and -8, is necessary for tBid expression and translocation.Sequential Activation of Caspase-2 and -8 in Ceramideand Etoposide-induced Mitochondrial Apoptosis—To examine the regulatory relationship between initiator caspases, we verified the association of caspase-2 deficiency with defective caspase-8 activation by caspase inhibitors or an RNA interference approach. We first inactivated caspase-2 and -8 in 10I cells by pretreatment with z-VDVAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk, respectively. Results showed that pretreatment with z-VDVAD-fmk, but not with z-IETD-fmk, suppressed caspase-2 activity in response to ceramide stimulation. By contrast, caspase-8 activation was blocked by both z-IETD-fmk and z-VDVAD-fmk (Fig. 3A). Therefore, caspase-2 is required for ceramide-induced caspase-8 activation. When 10I cells were treated with etoposide, the results obtained were similar; pretreatment with z-VDVAD-fmk blocked both caspase-2 activity and caspase-8 activity, whereas pretreatment with z-IETD-fmk blocked only caspase-8 activity (Fig. 3A). To further confirm these results, we introduced the short hairpin RNA specific for caspase-2 (Fig. 3B) into human Jurkat T cells for interference with caspase-2 expression. Inhibition of caspase-2 expression but not of caspase-3, -8, or -9 expression was observed in the caspase-2 siRNA-expressing cells, which were collected by sorting of EGFP-positive cells (Fig. 3C).

However, the precise mechanisms underlying MDA-induced cell death are largely unknown. Here, we report that both p53 and Bax are central participants in the MDA-mediated cell death machinery in HCT116 human colon cancer cells. MDA, including epothilone B analogue (BMS-247550) and vinblastine, induced apoptosis of Bax-positive HCT116 cells in a p53-dependent manner; p53 was required for MDA-induced Bax conformational change. In response to MDA treatment, the BH3-only proapoptotic protein PUMA was up-regulated in p53-positive but not in p53 knockout HCT116 cells. Moreover, PUMA knockout HCT116 cells were resistant to MDA-induced Bax conformational change and apoptosis. In addition, introducing p53 plasmid DNA into p53-deficient HCT116 cells restored PUMA expression and apoptotic response to MDA treatment. However, ectopic expression of the p53 point mutation L22Q/W23S, but not the proline-rich domain deletion mutants 83-393 and ΔProAE, could also sensitize p53 knockout HCT116 cells to MDA-induced Bax activation and apoptosis, although all mutants failed to restore PUMA expression. Together, these findings suggest that p53 acts upstream of Bax to promote MDA-mediated cell death in a proline-rich domain-dependent manner through both transcription-dependent (by up-regulating PUMA expression) and -independent mechanisms in human colon cancer HCT116 cells.

These drugs prevent cell cycle progression beyond the G2/M phase and subsequently kill cancer cells by activating apoptotic signaling pathway (4Jordan M.A. Wendell K. Gardiner S. Derry W.B. Copp H. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 816-825PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.-G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ngan V.K. Bellman K. Panda D. Hill B.T. Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5045-5051PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise biochemical mechanisms by which MDA induce apoptosis are not well understood. Mitochondria play an essential role in apoptosis induction (7Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Once death signals are transduced to mitochondria, the outer membrane of mitochondria becomes permeabilized, resulting in the release of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, AIF, Omi/HtrA2, and Endo G into the cytosol or nucleus where they are actively involved in the process of caspase activation and protein/DNA degradation (8Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family of proteins, which consists of both anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules, controls the mitochondrial function in apoptosis (9Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL possess four conserved BH domains (BH1–4) and prevent the release of apoptogenic molecules from mitochondria. In contrast, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which can be further divided into the Bax subfamily (includes Bax, Bak, and Bok multidomain proteins) or the BH3-only subfamily (such as Bid, Bim, and PUMA), induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. It is believed that the BH1–3 proteins Bax and Bak are death effectors that are absolutely required for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (10Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 11Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, Bax exists in an inactive form, mainly in the cytosol, but can be induced to undergo a conformational change and migrate to the mitochondria by apoptotic signals (12Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 13Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The conformationally changed Bax protein oligomerizes on the mitochondrial outer membrane and induces cytochrome c release (14Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins prevent Bax conformational change, whereas various BH3-only proteins induce it in response to apoptotic stimuli (15Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor protein, which is stabilized and activated by a variety of genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress, plays a central role in the chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (16Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5850) Google Scholar, 17Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W.

It has been shown that p53 triggers apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization through transcription-dependent and -independent mechanisms (19Schuler M. Green D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 684-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax, PUMA, Noxa, and Bid have been reported to be transcriptional targets of p53 (20Miyashita T. Reed J.C.

In contrast, it has been demonstrated recently that upon DNA damage p53 translocates to mitochondria where it directly binds to Bcl-XL or Bak and induces Bax/Bak activation and cytochrome c release (25Mihara M.

Since the role of p53 in apoptosis induction varies between cell types and death signals, the functional importance of p53 in MDA-induced apoptosis of human cancer cells remains controversial (30Wahl A.F.

To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying MDA-induced apoptosis, we used HCT116 cells in which the p53 or bax gene is disrupted by homologous recombination (36Bunz F.

Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). We found that p53 regulates the death effector Bax activation by inducing the BH3-only protein PUMA in response to MDA. In addition, MDA treatment results in p53 translocation to the mitochondrion, which correlates with induction of Bax activation through a transcription-independent mechanism.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of p53 and Bax in MDA-mediated cytotoxicity, we treated p53 or Bax knockout HCT116 cells (37Zhang L. Yu J. Park B.H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 2000; 290: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 43Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) versus their parental control cells with EpoB, which induces tubulin polymerization and stabilizes microtubules, or VBL, which destabilizes microtubules for different periods or various concentrations. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, both EpoB and VBL could induce cell death of parental HCT116 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, knockout of either p53 or Bax significantly reduced the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to death induced by these microtubule-damaging drugs. To confirm whether MDA cause cell death by induction of apoptosis, DNA ladder formation and caspase-3 activity were examined. After 12 h of treatment with 100 nm EpoB or 20 nm VBL, most of the cells stopped cell cycle at the G2/M phase (data not shown) followed by caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1D) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C). However, the onset of caspase-3 activation and DNA ladder formation was obviously delayed in p53 or Bax-deficient cells (Fig. 1, C and D), although they behaved in the G2/M arrest similar to their parental cells in response to MDA (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the loss of p53 or Bax confers resistance of HCT116 cells to apoptosis induced by both microtubule-stabilizing and -destabilizing agents. To further confirm the role of p53 in MDA-induced apoptosis, we restored p53 expression in p53-deficient HCT116 cells with a p53 expression plasmid (Fig. 2). Several independent clones with various p53 protein levels were obtained and used to determine the functional importance of the p53 protein expression in MDA-mediated cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig. 2A, EpoB treatment resulted in stabilization and accumulation of both endogenous and exogenous p53 protein. In correlation with p53 accumulation, the p21 protein was up-regulated by EpoB, whereas the Bax protein level did not change (Fig. 2A). Moreover, restoration of p53 sensitized the p53 knockout HCT116 cells to apoptosis induced by EpoB or VBL (Fig. 2, B and C). These data clearly indicate that p53 contributes to MDA-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells. In addition, it should be noted that clone 11, which lacks both p53 and Bax, displayed reduced apoptotic cell death comparable to that in the p53 or Bax knockout cells (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that p53 functions upstream of Bax in controlling MDA-mediated apoptosis. It is well accepted that p53 induces Bax expression in response to a wide variety of stress, but the protein level of Bax was not significantly altered in MDA-treated HCT116 cells (Figs. 2, 3, 4). We have previously reported that EpoB induces Bax conformational change in human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 cells (5Yamaguchi H. Paranawithana S.R. Lee M.W. Huang Z. Bhalla K.N. Wang H.-G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 is required for MDA to induce Bax activation, p53 knockout or parental HCT116 cells were treated with EpoB or VBL and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-Bax 6A7 antibody, which specifically recognizes the conformationally changed Bax protein (13Yamaguchi H. Wang H.-G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7779-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 44Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). As expected, MDA induced Bax conformational change in p53-positive but not p53-deficient cells (Fig. 2D). However, ectopic expression of p53 restored the sensitivity of p53 knockout HCT116 cells to MDA-induced Bax conformational change (Fig. 2E). These results strongly suggest that p53 is critical for Bax activation and apoptosis induced by MDA.Fig. 4PUMA is important for MDA-induced apoptosis. PUMA–/– and +/+ HCT116 cells were treated with 100 nm EpoB or 20 nm VBL for the indicated times and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot (A), caspase-3 activity (B), trypan blue dye exclusion (C), and anti-Bax 6A7 immunoprecipitation (D) analyses. DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been reported that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins prevent Bax conformational change, whereas proapoptotic BH3-only proteins promote it (9Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bax, Bak, PUMA, Bid, Bad, and Bim, in HCT116 or cells defective in p53 or Bax after EpoB or VBL treatment for various periods of time by immunoblot analysis. We observed that the BH3-only protein PUMA was up-regulated by MDA in parental and Bax knockout cells but not in p53-deficient HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A), whereas the expression of Bim, Bid, Bad, Bax, Bak, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL did not change (not shown). Moreover, the p53-dependent PUMA expression in response to MDA was confirmed in p53-restored HCT116 clones (Fig. 3B). Mitochondrial translocation of BH3-only proteins has been suggested as a critical step in Bax activation during apoptosis (14Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 45Bouillet P. Purton J.F. Godfrey D.I. Zhang L.C. Coultas L. Puthalakath H. Pellegrini M. Cory S. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 415: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 has been reported to translocate to mitochondria after DNA damage and associate with Bcl-XL, resulting in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed subcellular fractionation experiments to determine the mitochondrial translocation of several proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins as well as p53 in HCT116 cells after EpoB or VBL treatment (Fig. 3C). Along with the induction of PUMA expression by MDA, the portion of mitochondria-associated PUMA and Bax increased, whereas the mitochondrial localization of Bim and Bid was not altered during MDA treatment (Fig 3C). These results suggested that PUMA is a potential initiator of MDA-induced Bax activation and apoptosis. In addition, a detectable portion of p53 also translocated to mitochondria after MDA treatment (Fig. 3C), suggesting that p53 may directly impact on mitochondria during MDA-induced apoptosis. To explore the role of PUMA in MDA-induced apoptosis and Bax conformational change, we next utilized HCT116 cells lacking the PUMA gene (39Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PUMA–/– and PUMA+/+ HCT116 cells were treated with EpoB or VBL for the indicated times and subjected to analyses of cell viability (Fig. 4C), caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4B), and Bax conformational change (Fig. 4D). The deficiency of MDA-induced PUMA expression in PUMA knockout HCT116 cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4A). As expected, PUMA-deficient cells exhibited resistance to cell death and caspase-3 activation induced by EpoB or VBL (Fig. 4, B and C). Concomitantly, MDA-induced Bax conformational change was inhibited in PUMA-deficient cells compared with parental control HCT116 cells (Fig. 4D). These results clearly indicated that PUMA is important for p53-mediated Bax activation and apoptosis in response to MDA. Finally, we examined the role of p53 in MDA-induced apoptosis by transfection of p53-deficient HCT116 cells with p53 mutants lacking transcriptional activity. We utilized two kinds of p53 mutant: L22Q/W23S, which contains two point mutations in the transactivation domain, and the 83-393 deletion mutant, which lacks both the transactivation and proline-rich domains but contains the DNA binding domain required for p53 association with Bcl-XL (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 46Kokontis J.M. Wagner A.J. O'Leary M. Liao S. Hay N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The stable transfectants were exposed to either EpoB or VBL and subjected to caspase-3 assay (Fig. 5A) and DNA fragmentation analysis (Fig. 5B). Ectopic expression of the L22Q/W23S mutant sensitized p53-deficient cells to MDA-induced caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation, whereas the deletion mutant 83-393 did not (Fig. 5, A and B). In agreement with these results, Bax activation (6A7 positive) occurred in cells expressing p53 mutant L22Q/W23S but not 83-393 after EpoB or VBL treatment (Fig. 5C). However, neither L22Q/W23S nor 83-393 induced PUMA expression in response to EpoB or VBL (Fig. 5D), and both mutants could be detected in the mitochondrial fraction (not shown). In addition, we examined another p53 mutant, ΔProAE, which lacks the entire proline-rich domain (amino acids 62–91) but retains the transactivation domain (41Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), to further separate transcription dependent from independent effects of p53 on MDA-induced apoptosis. The p53–/– HCT116 cells were transfected with ΔProAE-producing plasmid DNA, and several independent clones were obtained and subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot (Fig. 6A) and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 6B) analyses after EpoB or VBL treatment. Surprisingly, the ΔProAE mutant failed to induce PUMA expression (Fig. 6A) and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6B) in p53–/– HCT116 cells in response to MDA. However, ΔProAE activated the p53 target gene, p21, in response to DNA damage (Fig. 6C), consistent with the previous report (41Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Similar to MDA, VP-16 could induce PUMA in HCT116 cells with wild type (+/+) but not proline-rich domain deletion p53 (Fig. 6C), indicating that the proline-rich domain of p53 is required for activation of the PUMA gene. Since p53 has recently been shown to interact directly with Bcl-XL (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 27Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar), we examined the interaction between Bcl-XL and p53 by co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether p53 binding to Bcl-XL is associated with its death-inducing activity. Unexpectedly, not only the wild type p53 but also the mutants L22Q/W23S, 83-393, and ΔProAE were co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged Bcl-XL (Fig. 6D) regardless of their ability to induce apoptosis. It should be noted, however, that all of these p53 mutants retain the potential Bcl-XL-binding sites (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that mutant p53 contributes to MDA-induced Bax activation and apoptosis as well, which probably requires both the proline-rich and Bcl-XL-binding domains.

The results described in the present study show that p53 is important for MDA-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT116 cells. p53 induces PUMA expression, which triggers Bax activation and apoptosis, in response to MDA. Although the majority of tumor cells have p53 mutations, MDA is widely effective against a variety of cancers. Therefore, it is possible that as tumors progress, the functional p53 gene is mutated and the loss of p53 function leads to the activation of alternative cell death pathways independent of p53 transactivity in response to MDA. Indeed, we demonstrated that p53 could contribute to MDA-mediated cytotoxicity in a transcription-independent manner as well. The death effector Bax is a transcriptional target of p53 and plays an essential role in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. In the absence of death signals, the Bax protein exists in an inactive form, but it becomes activated by a conformational change during apoptosis. Although Bax expression was not up-regulated by EpoB or VBL in HCT116 cells, our results clearly demonstrate that MDA-induced Bax conformational change depends on the presence of p53. The mechanism of how the Bax conformation is controlled in cells remains unclear, but the involvement of the BH3-only proteins has been proposed (9Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The BH3-only protein Bim, especially the BimEL and BimL isoforms, has been reported to be sequestered on microtubules in healthy cells and to translocate to mitochondria by apoptotic stimulation (47Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Bim can induce Bax conformational change (38Yamaguchi H. Wang H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41604-41612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is important for microtubule damage-induced apoptosis (48Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). In human breast cancer cells, paclitaxel treatment up-regulates Bim expression through activation of the transcription factor FoxO, which contributes to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (49Sunters A. Fernandez de Mattos S. Stahl M. Brosens J.J. Zoumpoulidou G. Saunders C.A. Coffer P.J. Medema R.H. Coombes R.C. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49795-49805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, our studies indicated that neither Bim localization nor expression was altered by EpoB or VBL in HCT116 cells, suggesting that Bim may not be the primary initiator of MDA-mediated apoptosis in this colon cancer cell line. Bid is another BH3-only protein reported to be up-regulated by p53 (24Sax J.K. Fei P. Murphy M.E. Bernhard E. Korsmeyer S.J. El-Deiry W.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 842-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Bid is activated by caspase-8 or granzyme B cleavage and the truncated tBid can activate Bax on mitochondria (50Barry M. Heibein J.A. Pinkoski M.J. Lee S.F. Moyer R.W. Green D.R. Bleackley R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3781-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 51Chen M. He H. Zhan S. Krajewski S.

J. 2002; 368: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our results showing that damaging the microtubule with EpoB or VBL induces neither Bid expression nor Bid cleavage, however, suggest that Bid is also not the primary target of MDA in HCT116 cells. PUMA is originally identified as a p53 target gene encoding a BH3 domain-containing polypeptide (21Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol.

Recent studies with knockout mice or human cancer cells demonstrated that PUMA is essential for p53-dependent apoptosis induced by DNA damage (39Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L.

Furthermore, PUMA is also involved in p53-independent cell death (53Villunger A. Michalak E.M. Coultas L. Mullauer F. Bock G. Ausserlechner M.J. Adams J.M. Strasser A.

In the present study, we have further demonstrated that PUMA plays an important role in MDA-induced apoptosis of p53-positive HCT116 cells. However, the extent of Bax conformational change and caspase activation induced by EpoB or VBL in PUMA-deficient HCT116 cells seems to be less than those in p53 knockout HCT116 cells. In addition, MDA could induce caspase-3 activation in HCT116 cells treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (data not shown). Therefore, p53 may also contribute to Bax-dependent caspase activation through a transcription-independent pathway as reported previously (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 55Caelles C. Heimberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In fact, the levels of mitochondria-associated p53 increased in MDA-treated cells (Fig. 3C), as previously observed in the cells treated by DNA damage (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar, 26Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra III, A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). However, how p53 exerts its transcription-independent proapoptotic activity is still controversial. Mihara et al. (25Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) have shown that the p53 DNA-binding domain is essential for its association with Bcl-XL and death-inducing activity, whereas other reports (27Chipuk J.E.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) have indicated that the proline-rich domain is critical for p53 to induce transcription-independent apoptosis. Our results obtained from three distinct p53 mutants, the L22Q/W23S point mutation and the proline-rich domain deletion mutants 83-393 and ΔProAE (which contain the Bcl-XL-binding sites), strongly suggested that the proline-rich region of p53 may be involved in p53-mediated transactivation-independent Bax conformational change, caspase activation, and apoptosis of HCT116 cells in response to MDA. In summary, p53 plays a pivotal role in MDA-induced apoptosis of HCT116 cells by activating the death effector Bax through induction of the BH3-only protein PUMA expression (Fig. 7). In addition, a transcription-independent pathway may also participate in p53-mediated Bax activation in response to MDA (Fig. 7). Clearly, further studies are required to determine the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of p53 transactivation and transcription-independent pro-apoptotic activity by MDA.

Their cytotoxic activities require the synergistic association of a class S component and a class F component, produced as water-soluble monomers that form hetero-oligomeric membrane-associated complexes. Strains that produce the Panton-Valentine leucocidin are clinically associated with cutaneous lesions and community-acquired pneumonia. In a previous study, we determined the crystal structure of the F monomer from the Panton-Valentine leucocidin. To derive information on the second component of the leucotoxins, the x-ray structure of the S protein from the Panton-Valentine leucocidin was solved to 2.0 Å resolution using a tetragonal crystal form that contains eight molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure demonstrates the different conformation of the domain involved in membrane contacts and illustrates sequence and tertiary structure variabilities of the pore-forming leucotoxins. Mutagenesis studies at a key surface residue (Thr-28) further support the important role played by these microheterogeneities for the assembly of the bipartite leucotoxins.

Among the bacterial β-barrel pore-forming toxins, the subfamily of staphylococcal bicomponent leucotoxins (leucocidins, Luk, and γ-hemolysins, Hlg) include seven class S proteins (LukS-PV, LukS-R, LukE, LukM, HlgA, HlgC, and LukS-I: ≈32 kDa) and six class F proteins (LukF-PV, LukF-R, LukD, LukF'-PV, HlgB, and LukF-I: ≈34 kDa) that are able to synergistically permeabilize human polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, and macrophages (1Prévost G.

To achieve pore formation, the secreted class S proteins primarily bind to specific membrane receptors whose abundance varies according to the protein kinase C pathway (2Colin D.A. Mazurier I.

Genes encoding γ-hemolysins are present in almost all clinical strains, whereas the Panton-Valentine leucocidin, composed of LukS-PV and LukF-PV, is secreted by strains isolated from humans with abscesses, furuncles, and community-acquired pneumonia. Other members, such as LukE-LukD, have been found associated with staphylococcal bullous impetigo of young infants and post-antibiotic diarrhea (1Prévost G. Menestrina G. Colin D.A. Werner S. Bronner S. Serra M.D. Baba Moussa L. Coraiola M. Gravet A. Monteil H. Menestrina G. Serra M.D. Lazarovici P. Pore-Forming Peptides And Protein Toxins. Taylor and Francis Publishers, London2003: 3-26Google Scholar). Bicomponent leucotoxins are related in sequence, structure, and function to staphylococcal α-hemolysin (33 kDa), the β-barrel pore-former prototype, and similar proteins have also been found in Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus (10Gouaux E. Hobaugh M. Song L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2631-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Menestrina G. Serra M.D. Prévost G. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the detergent-solubilized α-hemolysin homo-heptamer has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution and revealed details of the assembled toxin (12Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). The α-hemolysin mushroom-shaped complex is divided in three domains: the cap, the rim, and the stem. The cap consists of the β-sandwich and amino latch from each protomer. It is extended underneath by the rim domains, each consisting of an open face sandwich, that form the base for a direct interaction with lipid bilayers. Each protomer also participates in the stem, the transmembrane β-barrel pore, by a central sequence folded as a β-hairpin. The x-ray structures of the secreted water-soluble monomeric form of two class F proteins, HlgB from γ-hemolysin (13Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and LukF-PV from the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (14Pédelacq J.D. Maveyraud L. Prévost G. Baba-Moussa L. Gonzalez A. Courcelle E. Shepard W. Monteil H. Samama J.P. Mourey L. Structure. 1999; 7: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), were also determined. They revealed a similar overall fold as the α-hemolysin protomer, except that the stem region adopts a more compact conformation, forming three antiparallel β-strands stacked against the β-sandwich domain. Other structural deviations are confined to some connecting loops, to the N and C termini and to the respective orientation of the rim and β-sandwich domains. No high resolution structural information is available for an assembled leucotoxin oligomer whose molecular architecture remains to be precisely elucidated because it was shown that F and S components of γ-hemolysin may form a heterohexamer (15Sugawara N. Tomita T. Kamio Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Ferreras M. Hoper F. Dalla Serra M. Colin D.A. Prévost G. Menestrina G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 108-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4968-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a heteroheptamer (18Sugawara-Tomita N. Tomita T. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4747-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or a heterooctamer (17Nguyen V.T. Kamio Y. Higuchi H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4968-4979Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Miles G. Movileanu L. Bayley H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that sequence identity between leucotoxins F and S components or between F (or S) components and α-hemolysin does not exceed 30%, the available structural data strongly suggest that all these pore-forming proteins, which share the transition from a hydrosoluble state to a membrane-stabilized structure, have evolved from a common ancestor. Based on such evolutionary considerations the different subunit-subunit interfaces found in leucotoxins may be related to the single interface of α-hemolysin (19Miles G. Movileanu L. Bayley H. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 894-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and could involve similar geometrical and structural features. Then complementary mutations must have occurred to explain that (i) class S proteins bear specific structural features compatible with membrane ligand binding, (ii) class F proteins combine to previously bound class S proteins to form a functional pore, and (iii) leucotoxin hetero-oligomers may display a wide variety of combinations and permutations (20Gravet A. Colin D.A. Keller D. Girardot R. Monteil H. Prévost G. Giradot R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Prévost G. Bouakham T. Piémont Y. Monteil H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The basis of microevolution was also demonstrated by the reversion of the cationic selectivity of γ-hemolysin to an anionic one comparable with that of α-hemolysin (22Comai M. Dalla Serra M. Coraiola M. Werner S. Colin D.A. Monteil H. Prévost G. Menestrina G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1251-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we report the three-dimensional structure determination and analysis of the S component of the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (LukS-PV, 284 residues, 32.3 kDa) from a tetragonal crystal form that diffracts x-rays to 2.0 Å (23Guillet V. Keller D. Prévost G. Mourey L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The determination of this first three-dimensional structure of a S protein confirms that it resembles that of the F proteins and brings further important details about the subtle variability that can be accommodated within the fold of the pore-forming leucotoxins superfamily. The rim domain, which has been previously suggested to play an important role in membrane binding, constitutes the most structurally heterogeneous part of the F and S structures. In addition, mutagenesis studies performed at Thr-28, a key interface residue, illustrate the impact of microheterogeneity on the structure-function relationships of the β-barrel pore-forming toxins. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Phasing—A detailed description of the protocols used for purification and crystallization of wild type and recombinant LukS-PV proteins has been published elsewhere (23Guillet V. Keller D. Prévost G. Mourey L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, crystallization was achieved by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 285 K with Jeffamine M-600 as the precipitant. Tetragonal crystals of wild type protein were obtained by cross-seeding monoclinic microcrystals of the recombinant protein in a drop prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein at a concentration of 20-25 mg/ml in 50 mm MES-NaOH, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PMN, polymorphonuclear cell; ATR, attenuated total reflectance; FTIR, Fourier-transformed infrared; rmsd, root mean square deviation. 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, and of the reservoir containing 30% (v/v) Jeffamine M-600, 0.1 m Tris-HCl at pH 8.0-8.9. These crystals belong to space group P43 with cell parameters a = b = 94.8 Å, c = 306.1 Å and previous calculations based on Matthews coefficient indicated that the asymmetric unit may contain up to 10 molecules. A 2.0-Å resolution native data set was collected from a single crystal at beamline ID14 -1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Molecular replacement was performed in all possible primitive tetragonal space groups using the program MOLREP (24Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4153) Google Scholar) as implemented in the CCP4 suite of programs (25Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The search model was truncated as a polyalanine, except for strictly conserved residues among S and F proteins and loops of the rim domain that obviously differ were removed. One solution corresponding to eight molecules in the asymmetric unit was apparent with correlation coefficient (C) and crystallographic R factor of 0.387 and 0.591, respectively, in the 35.5-3.0 Å resolution range. The final C and R factor with other space groups than P43 were not better than 0.253 and 0.617, respectively. The eight molecules in the asymmetric unit can be grouped by pairs (Table I). Within a pair, the two molecules are in the same orientation and related by the translation vector (0, 0, and 0.5). These results were in agreement with the Patterson map computed from the native data set, which displayed the second strongest peak (8% of the origin peak) at (0.0, 0.0365, and 0.5). Crystal packing showed no bad contact between symmetry-related molecules.Table IMolecular replacement resultsSolutionαβγTxTyTzR factorC19.39166.16−30.110.2020.0490.0000.6530.15129.39166.16−30.110.2020.0480.5070.6220.28730.00180.00−1.370.8020.4800.3450.6000.32340.00180.00−1.370.8020.4810.8380.6040.355580.6513.78149.950.5450.7030.3970.5980.359680.6513.78149.950.5470.7040.9030.5990.37270.000.0088.680.0210.6990.0580.5990.38280.000.0088.680.0190.6990.5650.5910.387 Open table in a new tab Model Building and Crystallographic Refinement—Manual model building and corrections were carried out using TURBO-FRODO (26Roussel A.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). The Rfree value was calculated from a random set of reflections (10%) that were omitted from structure refinement. Strict noncrystallographic symmetry was included during the first steps of the refinement. These constraints were finally released when 90% of the residues, corresponding to 89% of all atoms, were built. Solvent molecules were added as neutral oxygen atoms in the last stages of refinement when they appeared as positive peaks above 3.0-4.0 σ and displayed acceptable hydrogen bonding geometry. The final R and Rfree values were 0.209 and 0.247, respectively (Table II), and the average temperature factor for all protein atoms was 36.3 Å2. The mean coordinate error was estimated to be less than 0.28 Å (29Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Construction of Modified Proteins—Mutations of LukS-PV at position Thr-28 (Cys, Asp, Phe, His, Leu, Asn, and Ser) were achieved using dedicated oligonucleotides and a mutagenesis procedure similar to that of QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene), except that Pfu Turbo™ DNA polymerase was replaced by Arrow Taq™ DNA polymerase and T4 gp32 protein (Q-Biogene). DNA sequences corresponding to secreted proteins were previously cloned to express a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein into the expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) (31Baba Moussa L.

Escherichia coli XL1 Blue cells (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacIq ZΔM15 Tn10 (tetr)) (Stratagene) were used as recipients of recombinant plasmids containing mutated proteins. E. coli BL21 [F-, ompT, hsdS (rB-, mB-), gal] was used for overexpression of the pGEX-6P-1 glutathione S-transferasezfused leucotoxins as previously published (31Baba Moussa L. Werner S. Colin D.A.

Fluo-3 fluorescence (Molecular Probes) for Ca2+ entry and ethidium fluorescence were acquired with Lysis II™ software (Becton Dickinson) as previously described (22Comai M. Dalla Serra M. Coraiola M.

The results from at least four different donors were averaged and expressed as percentages of a control of human PMNs treated with wild type Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Base level values were obtained for each series of data from a control without toxin and were systematically subtracted from the other assays. It has been shown that LukS-PV has a high affinity for its membrane target with a dissociation constant of 0.07 nm (4Gauduchon V. Werner S. Prévost G. Monteil H. Colin D.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2390-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and wild type and mutated LukS-PV proteins were added at 1 nm. LukF-PV, whose dissociation constant for the PMN membrane-bound LukS-PV is 2.5 nm (2Colin D.A. Mazurier I. Sire S. Finck-Barbançon V. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3184-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was applied at 40 nm. Competition experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ on PMNs previously incubated at room temperature for 10 min with 1 nm of LukS-PV. Fluorescein-labeled LukS-PV G10C or LukF-PV S27C, both at a concentration of 20 nm, and increasing concentrations of mutated LukS-PV proteins or LukF-PV (from 1 to 1000 nm), respectively, were added 15 min before reading the fluorescence. IC50, the concentration of nonfluorescent competitor needed for 50% fluorescence inhibition, was determined from the best fit of independent triplicates of the residual cell fluorescence. kI app, the apparent inhibition constant, was calculated as earlier reported (4Gauduchon V. Werner S. Prévost G. Monteil H. Colin D.A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2390-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Baba Moussa L. Werner S. Colin D.A. Mourey L. Pédelacq J.D. Samama J.P.

Attenuated Total Reflectance ATR Fourier-transformed Infrared FTIR Spectroscopy—ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded as described before (34Menestrina G. Cabiaux V. Tejuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on a Bio-Rad FTS 185 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-tellurium detector, a KBr beamsplitter, and an attenuated total reflection attachment. Before analysis, leucotoxin samples at 0.6 mg/ml were desalted on G50 medium with 10 mm HEPESNaOH, pH 7.0. For each experiment, 50 μg of the given desalted leucotoxin were deposited and dried in a thin layer on one side of a 10-reflection germanium crystal. The crystal was housed in a liquid cell, and spectra were collected after flushing with N2 saturated with D2O for ∼30 min. They were analyzed with the Bio-Rad WIN-IR software package to obtain secondary structure content (34Menestrina G. Cabiaux V. Tejuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 35Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). Differential spectra were obtained by subtracting the averaged spectrum of wild type LukS-PV (four samples) from the average spectrum of each LukS-PV mutant (two to four samples). To compensate for small differences in protein concentration, before subtraction, each spectrum was normalized by dividing by a scalar corresponding to the area of its amide I′ band. To express the structural changes introduced by the mutations in the polypeptide backbone, we used the COBSI (change of backbone structure and interaction) index (36Barth A. von Germar F. Kreutz W. Mantele W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30637-30646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This index relates the absorbance change to the total protein absorbance integrated over the amide I′ region between 1700 and 1610 cm-1. For example, a COBSI index of 1% implies that in a protein having 300 amino acid residues, like the leucotoxins components, three of these residues have changed their conformation.

Unlike β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, this is a non- or uncompetitive inhibition with respect to ATP. We have examined whether we can utilize this enzymatic property to regulate the effects of β-adrenergic receptor stimulation differentially. After screening multiple new and classic compounds, we found that some compounds, including 1R,4R-3-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid hydroxyamide, potently inhibited type 5 adenylyl cyclase, the major cardiac isoform, but not other isoforms. In normal mouse cardiac myocytes, contraction induced by low β-adrenergic receptor stimulation was poorly inhibited with this compound, but the induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis by high β-adrenergic receptor stimulation was effectively prevented by type 5 adenylyl cyclase inhibitors. In contrast, when cardiac myocytes from type 5 adenylyl cyclase knock-out mice were examined, β-adrenergic stimulation poorly induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that the inhibition of β-adrenergic signaling at the level of the type 5 adenylyl cyclase isoform by P-site inhibitors may serve as an effective method to prevent cardiac myocyte apoptosis induced by excessive β-adrenergic stimulation without deleterious effect on cardiac myocyte contraction.

Adrenergic stimulation via the sympathetic nervous system is a major mechanism to regulate cardiac function (1Opie L.H. Braunwald E. Zipes D.P. Libby P. Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia2001: 443-478Google Scholar).

The immediate outcome of this stimulation is increased cardiac contractility and output. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway, by the use of β-AR antagonists, has been widely utilized to attenuate cardiac function in the clinical setting of treating high blood pressure for several decades. Recently, β-AR antagonists have been used in the treatment of heart failure, i.e. in hearts with deteriorated cardiac function. This paradoxical usage of β-AR antagonists in heart failure has been rationalized by the protection of the heart from excessive sympathetic stimulation. Under this pathological condition, it is well known that the sympathetic activity is increased markedly (2Vantrimpont P. Rouleau J.L. Ciampi A. Harel F. de Champlain J. Bichet D. Moye L.A. Pfeffer M.

Cardiol. 2000; 35: 569-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar) and, more importantly, the induction of cardiac myocyte apoptosis, as demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro studies (6Communal C.

Cruickshank J.M. Graham B.R. Blood Press. 2001; 10: 366-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is believed that regulating β-adrenergic signaling at the level of AC, instead of the receptor, may serve as an alternative to the common β-AR regulating therapy, which is most exemplified by direct activation of AC in the treatment of acute heart failure (9Hosono M.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AC is made of multiple isoforms that differ in tissue distribution and biochemical properties (13Hanoune J. Defer N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), with each tissue containing a distinct set of AC isoforms. Although the importance of biochemical regulations, e.g. regulation by Gβγ or kinases, has been investigated extensively, the importance of the difference in maximal catalytic activity among the AC isoforms has been less studied. Nevertheless the unique composition of AC isoforms likely confers distinct β-AR signaling attributes to each tissue, with the dominant AC isoform playing the largest role. Type 5 AC is a dominant isoform in the heart which possesses the highest enzyme catalytic activity among the AC isoforms, and it is either poorly expressed or absent in the other peripheral tissues including lungs (14Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These AC isoforms share multiple common properties, with a feature being the inhibition of catalytic activity by P-site inhibitors. This class of inhibitors comprises adenosine analogs (15Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) that inhibit AC activity by binding to the ATP substrate site (16Tesmer J.J. Dessauer C.W. Sunahara R.K. Murray L.D. Johnson R.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14464-14471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mode of inhibition of AC by P-site inhibitors, unlike that of β-AR by its antagonists, is either non- or uncompetitive with respect to the substrate ATP as shown by kinetic analysis (17Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, P-site inhibition is potent when the catalytic activity of AC is high (e.g. during stimulation by the α subunit of stimulatory G protein (Gαs)), but much less when AC is unstimulated or only mildly stimulated (10Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M. Kuramochi H. Saito S. Yamazaki H. Toya Y. Sakai I. Homcy C.J. Nishikawa K. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol.

In the current study, we have examined the AC isoform selectivity, in particular, type 5 AC selectivity, among P-site inhibitors (P-site inhibitors with metal chelating property and ribose-substituted P-site inhibitors), which have been described recently (10Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M. Kuramochi H. Saito S. Yamazaki H. Toya Y. Sakai I. Homcy C.J. Nishikawa K. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol.

We have also examined the effect of such inhibitors in regulating cardiac myocyte contractility and apoptosis induced by β-AR stimulation. Finally, using myocytes from mice with targeted disruption of type 5 AC (AC5KO) (19Okumura S. Takagi G. Kawabe J. Yang G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Vatner D.E. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y.

Reagents—All chemicals, including conventional P-site inhibitors, were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. A series of P-site inhibitors with metal chelating property (PMC) were synthesized as described (18Levy D.E. Bao M. Cherbavaz D.B. Tomlinson J.E. Sedlock D.M. Homcy C.J. Scarborough R.M. J. Med.

Ribose-substituted (RS) P-site ligands were purchased from Chem Ster Ltd. (Moscow, Russia). RS-1 is 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-7-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5(6H)-quinazolinone. RS-2 or NKY80 is 2-amino-7-(2-furanyl)-7,8-dihydro-5(6H)-quinazolinone. RS-3 is 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-7-phenyl-5(6H)-quinazolinone. RS-4 is 2-amino-7(4-chlorophenyl)-7,8-dihydro-5(6H)-quinazolinone. Overexpression of the AC Isoforms and Gαs in Insect Cells—Overexpression of each AC isoform or the Gαs in insect cells was performed as described previously (12Toya Y. Schwencke C. Ishikawa Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). High Five cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 20 μg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml egg white trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer A). Cells were disrupted with a sonicator and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellets were resuspended in the same buffer without EGTA (buffer B). For Gαs preparation, we used the supernatant fraction after ultracentrifugation. The crude membranes and the Gαs-rich supernatant were stored at -80 °C until use. Protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay system. We overexpressed the type 2, type 3, and type 5 AC isoforms because they represent each distinct subgroup within the AC family and can exhibit high catalytic activity when overexpressed in insect cells (12Toya Y.

The overexpression of recombinant AC isoform in insect cells increased the maximal catalytic activity by ∼58-fold for type 2 AC, 46-fold for type 3 AC, and 330-fold for type 5 AC over that of control cell membranes as determined in the presence of 50 μm Gαs·GTPγS·forskolin. Thus, under these conditions, each isoform was examined as the overwhelming AC activity in these cells. Tissue Preparation—Development of AC5KO was described previously (20Okumura S. Kawabe J. Yatani A. Takagi G. Lee M.C. Hong C. Liu J. Takagi I. Sadoshima J. Vatner D.E. Vatner S.F. Ishikawa Y. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). AC5KO mice used in this study have been backcrossed to C57BL/6 for five generations. Mouse tissues were minced and homogenized with a Polytron for 3 × 10 s in buffer A followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged further at 100,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellets were resuspended in buffer B, and stored at -80 °C until use. Animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the animal experiment committee of the Yokohama City University School of Medicine and New Jersey Medical School. AC Assay—AC catalytic activity was measured as described previously (12Toya Y. Schwencke C. Ishikawa Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixtures contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP containing 1 × 106 cpm [α-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 4 μg (for insect cells) or 5–10 μg (for tissues) of membrane protein in a final volume of 100 μl. Gαs-enriched supernatant obtained from insect cells overexpressing Gαs was used in an amount that stimulated AC maximally in the presence of 1 μm GTPγS. Assays were performed at 30 °C for 15 min and terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 2% SDS. To monitor the recovery from the columns, 3H-labeled cAMP was used. cAMP was separated from ATP by passing through Dowex and alumina columns, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. cAMP-dependent Kinase Activity Assay—cAMP-dependent kinase activity was determined as described previously with some modifications (23Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J.

Briefly, H9C2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and grown to 90% confluence in 10-mm dishes. Cells were washed with PBS twice and harvested gently. The cell suspensions were centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min and resuspended in extraction buffer (25Sambrano G.R. Fraser I. Han H. Ni Y. O'Connell T. Yan Z. Stull J.T.

Cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was subjected to a cAMP-dependent kinase assay kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega, WI). cAMP-dependent kinase activity was determined by the addition of various cAMP concentrations in the presence or absence of 10 μm PMC-6. Myocyte Preparation—Primary cultures of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were prepared from the heart of a 1-day-old mouse, as described previously with some modifications (24Nyui N. Tamura K. Mizuno K. Ishigami T. Hibi K. Yabana M. Kihara M. Fukamizu A. Ochiai H. Umemura S. Murakami K. Ohno S. Ishii M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinization and collagenization were performed, and cardiomyocytes were maintained at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. To reduce the number of contaminating non-muscle cells, dissociated cells were preplated on 100-mm culture dishes in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 3 h. The non-attached cardiomyocyte-rich fraction was plated on plastic dishes. The culture medium was changed 48 h after seeding to minimum essential medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum with 1% penicillin-streptomycin. At this point, >95% of the adherent cells displayed spontaneous contractile activity, indicative of a predominant population of cardiomyocytes. Neonatal Wister rat cardiomyocytes were prepared in a similar manner except for the use of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were prepared as described previously with some modifications (25Sambrano G.R. Fraser I. Han H. Ni Y. O'Connell T. Yan Z. Stull J.T.

Briefly, the heart of a C57BL mouse at 10 weeks of age was excised, and the aorta was cannulated and mounted onto a Langendorff perfusion apparatus. The heart was perfused for 4 min in modified Joklik's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) consisting of 113 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 0.6 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 30 mm taurine, 2 mm creatine, and 2 mm carnitine, pH 7.4. Perfusion was then switched to a modified Joklik's minimal essential medium plus 0.1% (w/v) collagenase type II (Worthington). After 10 min of enzymatic digestion, the atria and right ventricle were removed, the left ventricle was cut into several pieces, and the cells were dispersed by gentle agitation. Enzyme digestion was stopped by adding Joklik's minimal essential medium containing bovine calf serum, and 1.2 mm calcium was reintroduced gradually to the cells. Myocytes were centrifuged for 1 min at 180 × g and resuspended in minimum essential medium containing 5% bovine calf serum, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Myocytes were counted, plated in a 10 μg/ml laminin-precoated glass cover, and incubated at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. After 1 h, medium was changed into minimum essential medium containing 0.1 mg bovine serum albumin, 10 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime, 1 mg/liter insulin, 0.55 mg/liter transferrin, 0.67 μg/liter selenium, 2 mm l-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. After 6 h, myocytes were exposed to isoproterenol (ISO) or ISO plus PMC-6 for 12 h and subjected to apoptosis assays. [3H]Adenine Labeling and cAMP Accumulation Assay—cAMP accumulation assays in neonatal myocytes were performed with [3H]adenine as described previously with some modifications (12Toya Y. Schwencke C. Ishikawa Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were incubated with [3H]adenine (3 μCi/well) for 24 h. Cells were washed four times with 20 mm HEPES-balanced serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and pretreated with 20 mm HEPES-balanced serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 mm IBMX. Some experiments were performed without IBMX. Reactions were started by the addition of ISO and terminated by the addition of 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 0.25 mm ATP, and 0.25 mm cAMP. The [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP were separated with single acidic alumina columns as described previously (10Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M. Kuramochi H. Saito S. Yamazaki H. Toya Y. Sakai I. Homcy C.J. Nishikawa K. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47785-47793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cAMP production was calculated as [3H]cAMP/([3H]cAMP + [3H]ATP) × 104. Myocyte Shortening Measurement by Edge Detection—Myocyte shortening was examined as described previously (26Minamisawa S. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10066-10070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Adult mouse ventricular myocytes were prepared as described above. After digestion and agitation of ventricles, myocytes were filtered and washed, and 0.5 mm calcium was reintroduced. Isolated cardiomyocytes were transferred to a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber located on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Diaphot-TMD, Tokyo, Japan). Cell shortening was measured using a video edge motion detector (IonOptix Inc., Boston) interfaced to a standard CCD camera (Myocam, IonOptix Inc., Boston), which was attached to the microscope. A 403 Nikon phase II objective was used. Cells were stimulated at 0.5 Hz with a 5-ms pulse duration by a electrostimulator (SEN-3301, Nihon Koden Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Edge detection measurements were performed on cardiomyocytes at 22 °C in continuously circulating Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 11.6 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose) on cells. The concentration of calcium in Tyrode's solution was fixed at 2 mm. Western Blot Analysis of Phospholamban—Western blot analysis of phospholamban was performed as described previously with some modifications (27Calaghan S. White E. Colyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were incubated with an increasing concentration of ISO in the presence or absence of 10 μm PMC-6. Incubation was terminated by washing three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in a homogenate buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Cellular suspension was sonicated and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in a homogenization buffer. After determination of protein concentration, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed, followed by densitometric analysis. Anti-phosphorylated phospholamban (16-serine) and anti-phospholamban antibody were purchased from Badrilla (West Yorkville, UK). Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—In situ labeling of fragmented DNA in cardiomyocytes was performed with the TACS 2-TdT Blue Apoptosis Detection Kit (Trevigen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (28Long X.

Briefly, cardiomyocytes on laminin-coated cover glass were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then incubated in 5 μg/ml proteinase K at room temperature for 20 min. The cells were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and washed with labeling buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CoCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 60 μm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, followed by a 60-min incubation at 37 °C in labeling buffer containing 150 μm dATP, 150 μm dGTP, 150 μm dTTP, 5 μm biotinylated dCTP, and 40 units/ml terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. Nuclear blue staining was viewed under a light microscope. The percentage of TUNEL-positive myocytes (relative to total myocytes) was determined in a blinded manner by counting about 3,000–5,000 cells in randomly chosen fields/glass cover. Analysis of DNA Fragmentation by ELISA—Histone-associated DNA fragments were quantified by the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications in lysis buffer (29Yamamoto S. Seta K. Morisco C. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1829-1848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In brief, myocytes were collected by gentle scraping in warm PBS and pelleted by centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min). The supernatant, which may contain necrotic DNA that had leaked through the membrane, was discarded. The pelleted cells were dissociated and incubated with a cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The resultant supernatant, which contained cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments, was applied onto a streptavidin-coated microtiter plate. Subsequently, a mixture of biotin-labeled anti-histone antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was added and incubated for 2 h. After removal of unbound antibodies by washing, the amount of nucleosomes was quantified by the peroxidase retained in the immune complex. The activity of peroxidase was determined photometrically with 2,2-azinodi-(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonate) as substrate. The values from triplicate absorbance (at 405 nm) measurements were averaged and corrected by protein amount. Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 enzymatic activity was determined with the cysteine protease protein 32 assay kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), which detects the production of the chromophore p-nitroanilide after its cleavage from the peptide substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide as described previously (30Casciola-Rosen L.

In brief, myocytes were solubilized, and aliquots of lysates containing equal amounts of protein were reacted with 200 mm DEVD-p-nitroanilide at 37 °C for 2 h. The activity was measured in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. AC Isoform Selectivity among P-site Inhibitors—We examined the AC isoform selectivity among 10 new P-site inhibitors (6 PMC inhibitors and 4 RS inhibitors) (10Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M.

PMC inhibitors contain an adenine ring joined by a linker to a metal chelating hydroxamic acid (18Levy D.E. Bao M. Cherbavaz D.B. Tomlinson J.E. Sedlock D.M. Homcy C.J. Scarborough R.M. J. Med.

RS inhibitors possess a pharmacophore (=C2H-N1 = C6(NH2)-) in their structure, which is known to play an important role in inhibiting AC catalytic activity (10Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M.

https://openalex.org/W2081282343,"Yan, an ETS family transcriptional repressor, is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase signaling via the Ras/MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation and downregulation of Yan is facilitated by a protein called Mae. Yan and Mae interact through their SAM domains. We find that repression by Yan requires the formation of a higher order structure mediated by Yan-SAM polymerization. Moreover, a crystal structure of the Yan-SAM/Mae-SAM complex shows that Mae-SAM specifically recognizes a surface on Yan-SAM that is also required for Yan-SAM polymerization. Mae-SAM binds to Yan-SAM with ∼1000-fold higher affinity than Yan-SAM binds to itself and can effectively depolymerize Yan-SAM. Mutations on Mae that specifically disrupt its SAM domain-dependent interactions with Yan disable the derepression function of Mae in vivo. Depolymerization of Yan by Mae represents a novel mechanism of transcriptional control that sensitizes Yan for regulation by receptor tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2042663951,"The interaction of calmodulin with its target proteins is known to affect the kinetics and affinity of Ca2+ binding to calmodulin. Based on thermodynamic principles, proteins that bind to Ca2+-calmodulin should increase the affinity of calmodulin for Ca2+, while proteins that bind to apo-calmodulin should decrease its affinity for Ca2+. We quantified the effects on Ca2+-calmodulin interaction of two neuronal calmodulin targets: RC3, which binds both Ca2+- and apo-calmodulin, and αCaM kinase II, which binds selectively to Ca2+-calmodulin. RC3 was found to decrease the affinity of calmodulin for Ca2+, whereas CaM kinase II increases the calmodulin affinity for Ca2+. Specifically, RC3 increases the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the C-terminal sites of calmodulin up to 60-fold while having little effect on the rate of Ca2+ association. Conversely, CaM kinase II decreases the rates of dissociation of Ca2+ from both lobes of calmodulin and autophosphorylation of CaM kinase II at Thr286 induces a further decrease in the rates of Ca2+ dissociation. RC3 dampens the effects of CaM kinase II on Ca2+ dissociation by increasing the rate of dissociation from the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin when in the presence of CaM kinase II. This effect is not seen with phosphorylated CaM kinase II. The results are interpreted according to a kinetic scheme in which there are competing pathways for dissociation of the Ca2+-calmodulin target complex. This work indicates that the Ca2+ binding properties of calmodulin are highly regulated and reveals a role for RC3 in accelerating the dissociation of Ca2+-calmodulin target complexes at the end of a Ca2+ signal."
https://openalex.org/W2034067409,"The GTPase dynamin is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Unlike most GTPases, dynamin has a low affinity for nucleotide, a high rate of GTP hydrolysis, and can self-assemble, forming higher order structures such as rings and spirals that exhibit up to 100-fold stimulated GTPase activity. The role(s) of GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in endocytosis remain unclear because mutations in the GTPase domain so far studied impair both. We generated a new series of GTPase domain mutants to probe the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis and to further test the role of GTP binding and/or hydrolysis in endocytosis. Each of the mutations had parallel effects on assembly-stimulated and basal GTPase activities. In contrast to previous reports, we find that mutation of Thr-65 to Ala (or Asp or His) dramatically lowered both the rate of assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis and the affinity for GTP. The assemblystimulated rate of hydrolysis was lowered by the mutation of Ser-61 to Asp and increased by the mutation of Thr-141 to Ala without significantly altering the Km for GTP. For some mutants and to a lesser extent for WT dynamin, self-assembly dramatically altered the Km for GTP, suggesting that conformational changes in the active site accompany self-assembly. Analysis of transferrin endocytosis rates in cells overexpressing mutant dynamins revealed a stronger correlation with both the basal and assembly-stimulated rates of GTP hydrolysis than with the calculated ratio of dynamin-GTP/free dynamin, suggesting that GTP binding is not sufficient, and GTP hydrolysis is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in vivo.

Dynamin is a large GTPase that is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). Dynamin has biochemical properties that distinguish it from typical GTPases (2Song B.D. Schmid S.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1369-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Specifically, it has a significantly lower affinity for nucleotide and a higher basal rate of GTP hydrolysis. Most notably, the rate of GTP dissociation from dynamin is 104 times faster than that from, for example, Ras (3Binns D.D. Helms M.K. Barylko B. Davis C.T. Jameson D.M. Albanesi J.P. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Hall A. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19718-19722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another distinguishing feature of dynamin is its ability to selfassemble to form higher order structures such as rings and spirals (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Self-assembly can stimulate dynamin GTPase activity as much as 100-fold (6Stowell M.H.B. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Dynamin spirals similar in dimensions to those formed in vitro can be detected as electron dense collars around the elongated necks of endocytic intermediates that accumulate in mammalian cells when clathrin-mediated endocytosis is inhibited by perturbing dynamin (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) or clathrin (8Iversen T.-G. Skretting G. Sandvig K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5175-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) function. Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of an assembly-defective dynamin mutant blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis (9Song B.D. Yarar D. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), confirming that dynamin self-assembly is required. However, dynamin collars have not been detected in unperturbed cells, suggesting that this intermediate is very short-lived. Despite the biochemical differences, the three-dimensional structure of the GTPase domain of dynamin A, which is highly conserved among dynamin family members, reveals that the core GTPase domain adopts the common globular fold of Ras and other GTPases, consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (10Niemann H.H. Knetsch M.L. Scherer A. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, the dynamin GTPase domain contains four consensus motifs that are shared among all GTPases (11Wittinghofer A. Hall A. GTPases. 24. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 244-310Google Scholar) and are involved in binding either to phosphate/Mg2+ ions or to the guanine base. As illustrated in Fig. 1, these include: G1, also called the P-loop, which in dynamin interacts with the α- and β-phosphates of the bound nucleotide (10Niemann H.H. Knetsch M.L. Scherer A. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); G2, comprising an invariant Thr residue (Thr-65 in dynamin) that coordinates Mg2+; G3, which encodes conserved residues that bind Mg2+ and the γ-phosphate; G4, which interacts through hydrogen-bonding with the guanine base. Residues around G2 and G3 that interact with and recognize the γ-phosphate of bound GTP constitute the switch 1 and 2 regions of GTPases, so-called because they are often disordered in the absence of bound GTP and switch to an ordered conformation upon GTP binding. As expected, these residues are not resolved in the structure of dynA GTPase domain in its unoccupied or GDP-bound states; however, given their positioning near the γ-phosphate, some are likely to play roles in nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis. The larger size of the dynamin GTPase domain compared with Ras (∼30 versus ∼20 kDa) is due to two internal insertions of, as yet, undefined function and to smaller C- and N-terminal extensions (10Niemann H.H. Knetsch M.L. Scherer A. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also unique for dynamin is the existence of a hydrophobic groove, formed by interactions between the N- and C-terminal α-helical extensions, that has been proposed to be the binding site for GED, 1The abbreviations used are: GED, GTPase effector domain; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; WT, wild type; sw, switch. the GTPase effector domain of dynamin (10Niemann H.H. Knetsch M.L. Scherer A. Manstein D.J. Kull F.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5813-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GED is required for self-assembly and for assembly-stimulated GTPase activity (12Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that GED can also influence GTP binding and hydrolysis in the unassembled state (9Song B.D. Yarar D. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), consistent with cross-linking and limited proteolysis studies that reveal stable GED-GTPase/middle domain interactions in unassembled dynamin (13Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Endocytosis is blocked in cells overexpressing dominant negative GTPase domain mutants of dynamin, suggesting that dynamin GTPase activity is required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). However, most of the mutants so far studied (K44A, S45N, T65F) are also defective in GTP binding (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 15Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). One mutation, T65A, was suggested to significantly inhibit GTP hydrolysis without impairing GTP binding (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, this assertion is inconsistent with the effects of this highly conserved, switch 1, Thr on GTP binding affinities in other GTPase family members (11Wittinghofer A. Hall A. GTPases. 24. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 244-310Google Scholar) and its role in coordinating Mg2+ for direct interaction with the γ-phosphate of bound GTP. Therefore, it remains uncertain as to whether endocytosis in vivo requires GTP binding and hydrolysis or only GTP binding. To probe the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by dynamin and to identify the residues that are critical for nucleotide binding and GTP hydrolysis, we have made a series of new mutations in the switch 1 and 2 regions of the dynamin GTPase domain. Analysis of the kinetic constants for the steady-state GTPase cycle revealed new mutants that differentially affect GTP binding and hydrolysis. The effects of overexpression of these mutants on endocytosis were examined so as to determine whether the rate of endocytosis correlated more closely with the ratio of dynamin-GTP/unoccupied dynamin or with the rate of GTP hydrolysis or both. Recombinant Baculoviruses and Adenoviruses—Point mutations were generated in human dynamin 1 in a pBluescript vector by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using the oligonucleotides (Operon) listed in Table I. The BamHI-KpnI fragment containing the entire gene was transferred to pVL1393 vector. The resulting plasmid together with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) was used to generate recombinant baculoviruses by following the manufacturer's instructions. To generate recombinant adenoviruses, the NdeI-NheI fragment from pBluescript was subcloned into pADTetT3T7 containing the gene for human dynamin 1 wild type, and the resulting plasmid together with ψ5 adenovirus DNA was then transfected into HEK293-cre4 cells as described (17Hardy S.

Two different dynamin concentrations were used, 1.0 μm for basal and 0.1 μm for lipid tubule stimulated GTPase activity. Initial velocities for GTP hydrolysis were measured at varying GTP concentrations and plotted as a function of GTP concentration to obtain the values for kcat and Km based on the Michaelis-Menten equation.

Using a multichannel pipette, samples were applied to nitrocellulose (0.45 μm, BA85, Schleicher and Schuell) in a filter dot-bolt apparatus (Schleicher and Schuell, minifold I) under vacuum. The filter was rapidly washed once with 250 μl of cold buffer. The procedure was repeated, six samples at a time. Each sample was assayed five times. Rapid filtration and washing was necessary for reproducible results given the very high rate of dissociation of GTP from dynamin (3Binns D.D. Helms M.K. Barylko B. Davis C.T. Jameson D.M. Albanesi J.P. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The dried filter was imaged using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant Software. Values for individual mutant dynamins were normalized to wild type dynamin. Transferrin Internalization and Its Correlation with Dynamin GTPase Activity—The kinetics of internalization of biotinylated transferrin into an avidin-inaccessible compartment was determined in tTA-HeLa cells expressing dynamin mutants (n = 6, Fig. 2), exactly as described (18van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). To determine correlation coefficients, the extent of transferrin internalization at 10 min was plotted as a function of the ratio of dynamin-GTP/dynamin or the relative rate of GTP hydrolysis by dynamin, calculated as indicated below from Michaelis-Menten steady-state kinetics (Equation 1) using 100 μm as the intracellular concentration of GTP (19Otero A.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 1399-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

Rate of GTP hydrolysis=kcatKm[Dyn][GTP](Eq. 5) We sought to identify critical residues in the dynamin GTPase domain that would exhibit differential effects on GTP binding and/or hydrolysis so as to test for differential requirements for these activities in endocytosis. For other GTPases, the switch (sw) 1 and 2 regions of the GTPase domain undergo major conformational changes upon GTP binding and are proposed to function in sensing the γ-phosphate of bound GTP (Fig. 1). Thus, we chose to mutate three amino acid residues in sw1 and 2 (Ser-61, Thr-65, Thr-141) to amino acids with different biochemical properties that could distinguish their roles in GTP binding and/or catalysis. Ser-61 is postulated to be located near the β-phosphate of bound GDP. To test whether its hydroxyl group might facilitate catalysis, Ser-61 was mutated to Ala, which would disrupt GTP hydrolysis, and to Asp, which might enhance GTP hydrolysis. The G2 motif (Thr-65) in sw1 is believed to coordinate the Mg2+ ion essential for nucleotide binding (11Wittinghofer A. Hall A. GTPases. 24. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 244-310Google Scholar); thus, it was surprising that its mutation to a hydrophobic residue (Ala) was reported to lower the rate of GTP hydrolysis without affecting GTP binding (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To determine whether the G2 motif of dynamin, in fact, plays a role distinct from the G2 motifs of other GTPases, Thr-65 was mutated to either Ala, Asp, or His. The T65A mutation was hypothesized to prevent nucleotide binding, since Ala, a hydrophobic residue, is unable to coordinate the Mg2+ ion required for nucleotide binding. On the other hand, mutation to Asp or His might increase nucleotide affinity if their greater ability to pull protons would correlate with their ability to coordinate Mg2+ ion. Finally, GTP hydrolysis requires the positioning and/or activation of a nucleophilic water molecule at the backside of the γ-phosphate of the bound GTP. In Ras-like GTPases, this is accomplished by a highly conserved glutamine residue within G3. This glutamine residue is not conserved in dynamin family members and corresponds to Met-140 in dynamin-1. Thus, to test the hypothesis that the neighboring Thr-141 in sw2 could instead play a role in positioning and/or activating the water molecule, it was mutated to Ala and Asp with the expectation that these mutations might reduce or increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, respectively. Each of these mutations was generated in human dynamin-1, and the proteins were expressed and purified from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. To assess the role of each residue in GTP binding and hydrolysis, kinetic analyses were performed to measure both basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activity of the individual mutant dynamins. Basal GTPase activity was measured at low concentrations of dynamin and at physiological salt concentrations to prevent dynamin self-assembly into higher order structures. Assembly-stimulated GTPase activity was determined using phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate-containing lipid nanotubules as a template for dynamin self-assembly. Under these conditions, the basal GTPase activity of wild type dynamin was stimulated 40–50-fold when measured in the presence of lipid nanotubules, consistent with previous reports (6Stowell M.H.B. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 9Song B.D. Yarar D. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutations in Switch 1 Exhibit Differential Effects on GTP Binding and Hydrolysis—Using these assays, we next determined the Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants (kcat and Km) for basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activities for WT dynamin and the individual mutants (Table II). We first examined the sw1 mutations and confirmed a role for sw1 residues in both GTP binding and hydrolysis. Although the S61A mutation did not significantly affect either GTP binding or hydrolysis, the S61D mutation significantly reduced the kcat for both basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activity without affecting the Km (Table II). Importantly, in the presence of the lipid tubule assembly templates, the GTPase activity of dyn1-S61D was stimulated to the same extent (∼50-fold) as dyn1-WT, suggesting that this mutation does not affect dynamin self-assembly (see below). From these data we conclude that the Ser-61 hydroxyl residue is not directly involved in the catalysis. However, the fact that substitution of a carboxylate residue (Asp) at this position lowers the rate of GTP hydrolysis suggests that a negative charge may develop near Ser-61 in the transition state. As previously reported (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 16Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we found that Thr-65 mutations (T65A, T65D, T65H) greatly reduced both basal and assembly-stimulated GTPase activity (36–100-fold), demonstrating that Thr-65 has an important role in catalysis (Table II). However, these mutations exhibited differential effects on the Km for GTP. Contrary to previous observations (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), but as predicted for other GTPases (11Wittinghofer A. Hall A. GTPases. 24. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 244-310Google Scholar), the T65A mutation lowered the apparent affinity for GTP by 8-fold for basal and by ∼50-fold for assembly-stimulated GTPase activity (Table II). Mutation of Thr-65 to a carboxylate residue, Asp, slightly increased the apparent GTP affinity of unassembled dynamin (2-fold) but significantly lowered that of assembled dynamin (14-fold). Similarly, although the T65H mutation showed a minimal effect on the Km for GTP of unassembled dynamin (less than 2-fold), the Km for assembled dynamin increased by 27-fold. The dramatic changes in the Km for GTP observed in the presence of lipid tubules suggest that the GTP binding pocket can undergo significant conformational changes upon dynamin self-assembly. Consistent with this, the Km of wild type dynamin-1 for GTP decreases >2-fold upon self-assembly. Together, these data suggest that residues in switch 1 are involved in both GTP binding and hydrolysis and that they undergo assembly-dependent conformational changes. Interestingly, Ser-61 and Thr-65 are both located within the sequence 57LPRGSGIVTR66, which is highly conserved across the entire dynamin family and corresponds to a region previously identified in Mx1 as a self-assembly motif (20Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect of self-assembly on GTP binding may in part be mediated through conformational changes in sw1, these sw1 mutations appear not to be defective in self-assembly or in assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis per se. Indeed, the degree of lipid tubule-dependent GTPase stimulation for most of these mutants, including S61A, S61D, T65D, T65H, was similar to or better than that observed for wild type dynamin (44∼61-fold compared with 40-fold). Moreover, velocity sedimentation demonstrated that these mutations are competent to self-assemble on lipid nanotubules (Fig. 2). The T65A mutation also showed significant (∼16-fold) assembly-dependent stimulation of GTPase activity and was unimpaired in its ability to self-assemble (Fig. 2) as reported by others (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A Mutation in Switch 2 Increases Dynamin Basal GTPase Activity—We next examined the effects of mutation of the switch 2 residue, Thr-141. Contrary to our hypothesis that Thr-141 could be involved in positioning and/or activating the nucleophilic water molecule, its change to a small hydrophobic residue (Ala) increased the kcat by 2-fold for both basal and assembled GTPase activity with only small affects on Km. Also unexpectedly, mutation to Asp, a potentially stronger activator of water, inhibited GTP binding and hydrolysis. Together, these results suggest that a hydrophobic environment is preferred in this region of the nucleotide binding pocket at the transition state and indicate that Thr-141 has roles in both GTP binding and hydrolysis, although the exact mechanism remains to be established. Although velocity sedimentation analysis established the ability of these mutants to self-assemble (Fig. 2), the degree of assembly-stimulated GTPase activity was reduced by mutations in this sw2 residue (10- and 27-fold stimulation for T141D and T141A, respectively). These data suggest that sw2 interactions also play a role in assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis. Mutations in the GTPase Domain of Dynamin Differentially Affect GTP Binding—The Michaelis-Menten constant, Km, reflects the rate constants for association and dissociation of the substrate as well as for catalysis (Km = (k–1 + kcat)/k1); thus, it is an indirect measure of GTP binding affinity. Therefore, we sought to test our predictions regarding the relative GTP binding affinity of these mutations based on Km data by directly measuring binding of the nonhydrolyzable analogue, GTPγ35S. Given the low affinity of dynamin for GTP and the rapid rate of dissociation (2 s–1) for bound GTP (3Binns D.D. Helms M.K. Barylko B. Davis C.T. Jameson D.M. Albanesi J.P. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7188-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), it has been difficult to accurately measure GTP binding using conventional filter binding or UV cross-linking protocols (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a rapid filtration protocol to measure binding of GTPγ35S directly (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results shown in Fig. 3 confirm most of our predictions regarding the relative GTP binding affinities of these mutants based on Km measurements. Thus, we find that GTPγ35S binding is unaffected by mutation of Ser-61 to either Ala or Asp and only slightly reduced by mutation of Thr-141 to Ala. Moreover, as predicted for other GTPases and consistent with our Km data, mutation of the sw1 Thr-65 to Ala potently inhibited GTPγ35S binding. Surprisingly, GTPγ35S binding to the T65D mutant was also potently inhibited, in sharp contrast to the Km measurements made under basal GTPase conditions. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, thio-substitution affects nucleotide binding. In fact, inhibition studies indicate that GTPγS binds more weakly to dynamin than GTP (Ki for GTPγS = 340 μm), 2M. Leonard, unpublished data. and it is possible that the T65D mutation is even more sensitive to structural differences in the bound nucleotide. Second, because the results obtained in the filter binding assay correspond more closely to Km values obtained for assembly-stimulated GTPase activity, they may be influenced by dynamin-dynamin interactions that occur during filtration. Temperature-dependent Effects on GTP Binding and Hydrolysis—Contrary to previous reports (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), our data establish that in addition to its reported effects on hydrolysis, mutation of Thr-65 to Ala substantially decreases GTP binding based on both Km values and direct measurements. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that we measure GTPase activity at the physiologic temperature of 37 °C, whereas the previous findings were based on measurements performed at room temperature (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indeed, we find that both kinetic parameters for dynamin GTPase activity, Km and kcat, are significantly affected by incubation at lower temperatures (Table III). Thus, both the basal and assembly-stimulated rates of GTP hydrolysis for wild type dynamin are ∼10-fold lower when assayed at 22 °C as compared with 37 °C, which is significantly greater than observed for many enzymes (22Wolfenden R. Snider M. Ridgway C. Miller B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7419-7420Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Similarly, when measured at 22 °C, the Km for GTP is ∼30-fold reduced for wild type dynamin measured under basal GTPase assay conditions and ∼6-fold reduced when measured in the presence of lipid tubules. The T65A mutant shows a pronounced defect in GTP hydrolysis at both temperatures. Strikingly, there is an ∼9-fold differential in Km for GTP measured under basal conditions at the two temperatures and an ∼50-fold differential when measured in the presence of lipid tubules (Table III). Indeed, when measured at 22 °C, our findings correspond to those reported by Marks et al. (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The relatively strong temperature dependence of these parameters of dynamin GTPase activity suggests that upon GTP binding and hydrolysis significant conformational changes may occur in the non-reacting parts of dynamin (23Chen Y.J. Zhang P. Egelman E.H. Hinshaw J.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 574-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) in addition to the active site and explains previous discrepancies in reported kcat and Km values for both wild type and T65A mutant dynamins (6Stowell M.H.B.

Open table in a new tab A Search for Catalytic Residues in the GTPase Domain— Dynamin has a relatively high intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis, at least when measured at physiologically relevant temperatures, suggesting that residues essential for catalysis are intrinsic to the GTPase domain in the unassembled state. Thus, we propose that dynamin assembly-stimulated GTPase activity, mediated by the GTPase activating protein activity of GED, functions to better position intrinsic catalytic residues for more efficient hydrolysis of GTP. This situation is more akin to that of Gα subunits, whose intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis (1–2 min–1) is stimulated ∼50–100-fold by RGS-type GTPase activating proteins, which alter the conformation of active site residues in the switch regions of the Gα GTPase domain for more effective catalysis (11Wittinghofer A. Hall A. GTPases. 24. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 244-310Google Scholar, 24Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Among these is a highly conserved arginine residue in Gα subunits that is located in sw1, near the invariant G2 Thr, which functions to neutralize negative charges that develop in the transition state during catalysis (24Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Although we have established that mutation of the sw1 and sw2 residues, Ser-61 and Thr-141 alter catalysis, neither is essential for GTP hydrolysis. Similarly, although mutation of Thr-65 severely impairs GTP hydrolysis, it also severely compromises GTP binding, and thus, a direct role in catalysis cannot be determined. In an attempt to identify essential catalytic residues within the dynamin GTPase domain that are specifically required for GTP hydrolysis, we mutated three conserved Arg residues within the sw1 region, Arg-54, Arg-59, and Arg-67; however, neither of these mutations significantly perturbed basal GTPase activity. 3S. P. Sholly, M. Leonard, and S. Schmid, unpublished data. Others have established that the R66A mutation equally impairs both GTP binding and hydrolysis (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic Arg within the dynamin GTPase domain, if it exists, remains elusive. The Dependence of Endocytosis on GTP Binding or Hydrolysis—We have generated a new series of mutant dynamins that exhibit differential and graded effects on Km and kcat for GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 4A). With these mutants in hand we sought to determine whether endocytosis rates would correlate more directly with the ratio of GTP bound:unoccupied dynamin, the rate of GTP hydrolysis, or both. To this end, recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild type and mutant dynamins under control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter were generated. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis was followed by measuring transferrin internalization in adenovirally infected tTA-HeLa cells overexpressing mutant dynamins (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistent with previous results (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 16Damke H.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), overexpression of either dyn1-T65A (open squares) or dyn1-T65D (black inverted triangles), which were severely defective in both GTP binding and hydrolysis, potently inhibited transferrin internalization. Also as expected, dyn1-S61A (black circles), which exhibited near wild type GTP binding and hydrolysis activities, had no effect on endocytosis as compared with dyn1-WT (open circles). In contrast, endocytosis was significantly inhibited by overexpression of dyn1-S61D (diamonds), which was defective in GTP hydrolysis, but exhibited normal GTP binding. Finally, endocytosis was, if anything, slightly stimulated by overexpression of dyn1-T141A (black triangles). For quantitative analysis, the extent of endocytosis in vivo at 10 min was plotted as a function of either the calculated ratio of dynamin-GTP/dynamin (Fig. 5, A and C) or as a function of their relative rates of GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 5, B and D), as determined in vitro based on Michaelis-Menten steady-state kinetics (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed no apparent correlation between the rates of endocytosis and the degree of dynamin-GTP loading, calculated based on the basal GTPase properties of dynamin (Fig. 5A) and only a weak correlation when calculated based on assembly-stimulated GTPase activity (Fig. 5C). In particular, dyn1-S61D (Fig. 5, black diamonds), which exhibited near wild type GTP binding as determined either by Km measurements or direct filter binding assays, was a significant dominant-negative inhibitor of endocytosis. The dyn1-T65D mutant is also a significant outlier in this analysis, at least when based on basal GTPase properties (Fig. 5A); however, the disparity in apparent affinity for GTP as assessed by Km values compared with direct GTP binding assays renders results from this mutant difficult to interpret. Nonetheless, data represented in Fig. 5, A and C, argue that GTP binding is not sufficient for dynamin function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis but suggest that conformational changes induced by both GTP binding and self-assembly may be important for dynamin function in vivo. In contrast, we observed a strong correlation between the rate of endocytosis and the calculated rates for both basal and assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 5, B and D). Transferrin internalization was reduced in cells overexpressing mutant dynamins with lower rates of GTP hydrolysis. We (16Damke H. Binns D.D. Ueda H. Schmid S.L. Baba T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and others (7Marks B. Stowell M.H. Vallis Y. Mills I.G. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2001; 410: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Hill E. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) report that GTPase-defective T65F and T65A mutants strongly inhibited transferrin internalization; however, because these mutations also severely impair GTP binding, the reasons for their inhibitory effects on endocytosis are difficult to interpret. Our observation that overexpression of dyn1-S61D (black diamonds), which has a 4–5-fold lower rate of GTP hydrolysis with little change in affinity for GTP, reduces the rate of transferrin internalization by ∼60% and is, by contrast, more informative. We have previously shown that overexpression of dynamin mutants specifically defective in self-assembly and thereby assembly-stimulated GTPase activity can accelerate a rate-limiting step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 26Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These mutations, located in GED, did not significantly affect the basal rate of GTP hydrolysis (12Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In contrast, each of the mutations studied here have equal effects on both basal and assembly-stimulated rates of GTPase activity. Thus, the tight correlation we see here between basal GTPase activity and endocytosis rates may reflect a specific role for dynamin basal rate of GTP hydrolysis in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recent studies at the synapse (27Evergren E. Tomilin N. Vasylieva E. Sergeeva V. Bloom O. Gad H. Capani F. Shupliakov O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2004; 135: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) confirm our earlier observations in nonneuronal cells (14Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) that unassembled dynamin is present on coated pits from their earliest stages of assembly and maturation. Dynamin interacts with multiple SH3 domain-containing effector molecules, and these interactions are likely to occur from the outset of dynamin association with the emerging coated pit. Thus, basal GTPase activity may play a role in regulating dynamin interactions with itself and with partner proteins during earlier stages of coated pit formation and maturation. Further studies will be needed to assess whether these effector interactions are regulated by and/or regulate the dynamin cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis. There are also several not mutually exclusive possibilities for the role of dynamin assembly-stimulated GTPase activity in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis may be directly involved in driving conformational changes in assembled dynamin that mediate membrane fission (5Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 6Stowell M.H.B. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GTP hydrolysis by assembled dynamin may function to dismantle the fission machinery for recycling in vivo. Indeed, GTP hydrolysis in vitro has been shown to trigger the rapid disassembly of dynamin (21Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and this interpretation would be consistent with recent observations that GTP hydrolysis by dynamin may not be required for a single round of vesicle formation in vitro (29Miwako I. Schroter T. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 376-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). There is precedence for this model in that GTP hydrolysis is required for the in vivo function and recycling of other GTPases such as Sar, Arf, SRP54, and SRP receptor, although GTPase defective mutants of each of these proteins are able to support single rounds of activity in vitro (30Matsuoka K.

Analysis of the effects of acute inhibition of dynamin GTPase activity in vivo, as opposed to long term overexpression experiments, will be needed to resolve these issues. In addition, the generation and analysis of new classes of mutants that selectively impair either assembly-stimulated or basal GTPase activities would be informative.

This work addresses the interaction between ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin in these cells. Ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin are colocalized in an intracellular striated compartment overlying the M-line and distinct from T-tubules, sarcoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and endosomes. β2-Spectrin is absent in ankyrin-B-null cardiomyocytes and is restored to a normal striated pattern by rescue with green fluorescent protein-220-kDa ankyrin-B. We identified two mutants (A1000P and DAR976AAA) located in the ZU5 domain which eliminate spectrin binding activity of ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B mutants lacking spectrin binding activity are normally targeted but do not reestablish β2-spectrin in ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes. However, both mutant forms of ankyrin-B are still capable of restoring inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor localization and normal contraction frequency of cardiomyocytes. Therefore, direct binding of β2-spectrin to ankyrin-B is required for the normal targeting of β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In contrast, ankyrin-B localization and function are independent of β2-spectrin. In summary, this work demonstrates that interaction between members of the ankyrin and β-spectrin families previously established in erythrocytes and axon initial segments also occurs in neonatal cardiomyocytes with ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin.

Ankyrin was in fact discovered based on its role as the membrane attachment site for spectrin in erythrocyte membranes (8Yu J. Goodman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2340-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Luna E.J. Kidd G.H. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2526-2532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bennett V. J.

Mutations of erythrocyte ankyrin result in deficiency of spectrin and cause hereditary spherocytosis in humans and mice (12Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J.

Members of the spectrin family also collaborate with ankyrins in cells other than erythrocytes. βIV-Spectrin colocalizes with ankyrin-G at axon initial segments and is lost in ankyrin-G knock-out mice (4Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Conversely, ankyrin-G exhibits reduced levels at axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier of βIV-spectrin mutant mice (15Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This work addresses the interaction between ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Ankyrin-B is required for localization of InsP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of these cells based on studies with primary cultures from ankyrin-B mutant mice (6Mohler P.J.

Ankyrin-B contains a 62-kDa spectrin binding domain that associates with high affinity (KD ∼ 25 nm) with β2-spectrin (19Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13550-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β2-Spectrin spliceoforms are expressed in adult heart (20Hayes N.V. Scott C. Heerkens E. Ohanian V. Maggs A.M. Pinder J.C. Kordeli E. Baines A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2023-2034PubMed Google Scholar), although their localization with respect to ankyrin-B has not been evaluated. Here we report that β2-spectrin is a physiological binding partner for ankyrin-B in neonatal cardiomyocytes. We also provide evidence for a functional hierarchy in which ankyrin-B determines the localization of β2-spectrin and operates independently of β2-spectrin in its role in organizing membrane-spanning proteins. Immunoblot Analysis—Quantitative Western blot analysis was performed using affinity-purified antibodies, 125I-labeled protein A, and phosphorimaging (17Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12980-12987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The yeast two-hybrid system was used to assay the interaction between ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin. Full-length and truncated fragments of the 220-kDa ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain were PCR amplified and inserted into pAS2-1 (Clontech). The known ankyrin binding domain of β2-spectrin was PCR amplified and inserted into pACT2. All constructs were completely sequenced and were free of mutations. Fusion protein expression in yeast was confirmed by Western blot analyses using commercially available binding domain and activation domain antibodies (Clontech). Plasmids were cotransformed into yeast (AH109) and assayed using ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ selection (Clontech). Transformants that exhibited growth on -Ade/His/Leu/Trp media were considered positive for interaction. Ankyrin-B Mutagenesis—Deletion constructs of human ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain were generated by PCR. Spectrin binding domain constructs correspond to residues 862-953 (D1), 862-1070 (D2), 862-1125 (D3), 862-1319 (D4), 966-1443 (D5), 1071-1443 (D6), 1158-1443 (D7), 966-1070 (D8), and 966-1125 (D9) of human 220-kDa ankyrin-B. These constructs were ligated into pAS2-1 and sequenced to verify that there were no mutations introduced by PCR. Alanine mutations were introduced into the D9 deletion construct (residues 966-1125) of 220-kDa ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain using the QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). A total of 13 alanine mutants including DAR976AAA, 2Ankyrin-B mutation nomenclature represent the original residue, the position number, and the new residue. For multiple amino acid substitutions (e.g. DAR976AAA) the number of the first residue is noted (976) followed by the residue changes. For example, DAR976AAA represents DAR (residues 976-978) changed to AAA. RH986AA, RK998AA, KRHR1012AAAA, EGE1024AGA, RGK1057AAA, ERE1060AAA, ENGD-1070AAGA, KE1074AA, 1082EDEAAA, ED1100AA, EKKR1104AAAA, and RD1112AA were generated and tested for spectrin binding in the yeast two-hybrid system. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and no other mutations were introduced by PCR. Random Mutagenesis—A mutant ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain library was created using GeneMorph PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene). The PCR protocol was optimized to obtain mutation frequency of 1 nucleotide mutation/ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain (∼1.75 kb). Mutagenized products were cloned into pAS2-1 vector, and clones were amplified to create a mutant library for yeast two-hybrid screening (∼4,000 clones). Yeast were cotransformed with mutant library and pACT2 β2-spectrin ankyrin binding domain (residues 1563-2093) and plated on -LT media. Single colonies were replicated on -ALT and -AHLT plates to identify cotransformants that did not interact with β2-spectrin. Noninteracting ankyrin-B clones were analyzed by immunoblot to confirm absence of stop codons, and positive clones were then analyzed by PCR and sequencing. Clones with only one mutation were subcloned back into the bait plasmid, and loss-of-interaction was confirmed. Antibodies—Antibodies include affinity-purified antibodies to β2-spectrin (21Hu R.J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), GFP (17Mohler P.J. Davis J.Q. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Michaely P. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescence—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and fixed in warm 4% paraformaldehyde (37 °C). Cells were blocked/permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.075% Triton X-100 and 3% fish oil gelatin (Sigma) and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washes (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100), cells were incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa 488, 568, 633; Molecular Probes) for 8 h at 4 °C and mounted using Vectashield (Vector) and no. 1 coverslips. Images were collected on Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope (100 power oil 1.45 NA (Zeiss), pinhole equals 1.0 Airy Disc) using Carl Zeiss Imaging software. All channels were collected on PMT3. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop for cropping and linear contrast adjustment. Three-dimensional images were created using 0.18-μm-thick Z-scans and assembled using Volocity Software (Improvision). Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from P1-P2 mice (22Tuvia S. Buhusi M. Davis L. Reedy M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and transfected as described previously (18Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After transfection, isolated cardiomyocyte spontaneous contraction rates and/or Ca2+ dynamics (Fluo-3 AM) were monitored as described previously (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Statistics—When appropriate, data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test, and values less than p < 0.05 were considered significant. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Identification of Mutations Eliminating Spectrin Binding Activity of Ankyrin-B—We needed ankyrin-B mutants lacking spectrin binding activity to evaluate the potential role of β2-spectrin in cellular localization and function of ankyrin-B (see below). Two strategies were employed to accomplish this goal: first, identify the minimal spectrin binding domain and then evaluate alanine-scanning mutations of surface residues within this domain; second, use random mutagenesis to create loss-of-binding mutations. Both approaches utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay. We constructed full-length and truncated polypeptides of the ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain (residues 862-1443) fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (see Fig. 1B). We also fused the minimal ankyrin binding domain of β2-spectrin (repeats 13-17, residues 1563-2093 (23Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)) with the GAL4 activation domain. As expected, the 62-kDa ankyrin-B domain interacts with β2-spectrin residues 1563-2093 in yeast (Fig. 1B). Truncated ankyrin-B constructs were designed based on the previous finding that limited proteolysis of the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin-R yields a subdomain corresponding to the ZU5 domain plus an additional C-terminal sequence (24Davis L.H. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ZU5 domains are a feature shared with the proteins ZO-1 and Unc5 (smart.embl-heidelberg.de). The predicted ZU5 domain did not have β2-spectrin binding activity. However, the 55 residues C-terminal to the predicted ZU5 domain have homology with a stretch of Unc5 but are missing in ZO-1 (not shown). The predicted ZU5 domain plus 55 C-terminal residues had β2-spectrin binding activity equivalent to full-length constructs, whereas constructs N-terminal and C-terminal to this stretch were inactive (Fig. 1B). These results define a 160-amino acid β2-spectrin binding sequence in the 62-kDa ankyrin-B domain. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of predicted surface residues on the minimal spectrin binding domain (Fig. 1C, construct D9, amino acids 966-1125) was performed to identify mutants lacking spectrin binding activity. A total of 13 sets of residues selected for high probability of location on the surface of the folded domain (i.e. 2 or more consecutive charged amino acids) were changed to alanines (two to four alanine substitutions/site; Fig. 1C). These mutants were cotransformed with β2-spectrin in yeast. 11 of the 13 mutants did not affect the ankyrin-B/β2-spectrin interaction (Fig. 1C). However, two alanine mutants affected ankyrin-B interaction with β2-spectrin. One mutant, DAR976AAA, completely abolished interaction with β2-spectrin, whereas the second mutant, ENGD1070AAGA, reduced but did not eliminate the ankyrin-B/β2-spectrin interaction (we observed minimal growth on AHLT medium; Fig. 1C). We also used random mutagenesis with yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify additional loss-of-binding mutations and to confirm independently the minimal spectrin binding domain. A mutant ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain library was created using PCR mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Yeast cells were cotransformed with the mutagenized library and β2-spectrin ankyrin binding domain (residues 1563-2093). Ankyrin-B mutants that did not interact with β2-spectrin and produced full-length ankyrin-B spectrin binding domain by immunoblot analysis were sequenced completely. Clones with only one mutation were subcloned back into the bait plasmid, and loss-of-interaction was confirmed. A screen of ∼4,000 clones identified one that did not interact with β2-spectrin. This mutant contained a single base mutation (G2998C) resulting in an alanine-to-proline substitution at amino acid 1000 (A1000P; Fig. 1B). A1000P is located within the minimal spectrin binding construct identified by truncation analysis (Fig. 1B) and is very close to the DAR976AAA loss-of-binding mutant. These experiments identified two mutations that eliminate spectrin binding activity of ankyrin-B and established a domain encompassing the predicted ZU5 domain as the minimal spectrin binding site of ankyrin-B. The 160-amino acid region, particularly residues surrounding DAR976, are highly conserved among the three human ankyrin gene products (R, B, G) and evolutionarily conserved in ankyrins from mouse to Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1D), all of which associate with β-spectrin polypeptides. Therefore, the minimal β2-spectrin binding domain of ankyrin-B likely is responsible for spectrin binding activity of other ankyrins. The ZU5 domains of Unc5 (Fig. 1D) and ZO-1 are highly divergent in this region, and these do not bind β2-spectrin (not shown). Reduction in Ankyrin-B Expression in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes Results in Abnormal Targeting and Expression of β2-Spectrin—We determined the predominant β2-spectrin isoform(s) present in mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes using an affinity-purified β2-spectrin antibody raised against spectrin repeats 4-9 (21Hu R.J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This β2-spectrin antibody does not cross-react with β1-spectrin from red blood cell ghosts but does recognize a 274-kDa β2-spectrin isoform in whole brain lysates (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis of wild-type neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes lysates revealed that 274-kDa β2-spectrin is the major isoform in developing ventricular cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2B). We did not observe lower molecular mass β2-spectrin isoforms in neonatal cardiomyocytes, including 240- or 180-kDa β2-spectrin isoforms observed in adult heart (data not shown). The potential requirement of ankyrin-B for β2-spectrin expression in heart was determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis of ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin in wild-type and ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes. Consistent with results from adult ankyrin-B+/- heart and isolated cardiomyocytes (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes display nearly a 50% reduction in expression of 220-kDa ankyrin-B (Fig. 2, B and C, n = 4, p < 0.05 (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V. Nature. 2003; 421: 634-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar)). Expression levels of the predominant β2-spectrin isoform (274-kDa β2-spectrin) were also decreased > 35% in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2, B and C, n = 4, p < 0.05). There was no difference in expression levels of other cardiomyocyte structural components including α-actinin (Fig. 2C; n = 4, p < 0.05). Ankyrin-B-null neonatal cardiomyocytes were not examined by immunoblot because of the scarcity of null animals, which die soon after birth. β2-Spectrin staining by immunofluorescence is nearly eliminated in ankyrin-B-null cardiomyocytes (the cell in this example is a cardiomyocyte as evidenced by α-actinin staining; Fig. 2E). Ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes is localized in a chimeric pattern where distinct regions of the cell display nearly normal ankyrin-B localization, and other regions of the cell are nearly completely lacking ankyrin-B staining (Fig. 1F). β2-Spectrin expression in ankyrin-B+/- precisely mimics the subcellular chimeric distribution of ankyrin-B and is missing from the same areas of these cells lacking ankyrin-B (Fig. 1F). Loss of ankyrin-B in either ankyrin-B+/- or ankyrin-B-/- cardiomyocytes does not affect the localization of other cardiomyocyte proteins marking the contractile apparatus (α-actinin), endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2)), or nascent T-tubules (dihydropyridine receptor) (18Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We next tested whether abnormal localization of β2-spectrin in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes could be restored to normal by expression of exogenous GFP-ankyrin-B. Reduction of ankyrin-B in ankyrin-B+/- and ankyrin-B-/- neonatal cardiomyocytes leads to abnormal cardiomyocyte spontaneous contraction rates and abnormal localization and expression of ankyrin-B-associated proteins including InsP3 receptor, ryanodine receptor, Na, K-ATPase, and Na/Ca exchanger (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V.

These abnormal phenotypes can be rescued by transfection of the cardiomyocytes with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S.

We expressed GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B in 3-day-old ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes and 36 h later determined the localization of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B using an affinity-purified GFP antibody. GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B was localized in a striated pattern similar to that of endogenous ankyrin-B (Fig. 3B). Transfection of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B rescues the expression and localization of β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that ankyrin-B is required for β2-spectrin targeting and expression in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Direct Interaction with Ankyrin-B Is Required for β2-Spectrin Targeting in Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—We used the ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocyte rescue assay and ankyrin-B mutants lacking β2-spectrin binding to determine whether direct interaction between ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin is required for β2-spectrin targeting in neonatal cardiomyocytes. GFP-ankyrin-B EDE1082AAA, an ankyrin-B mutant in the spectrin binding region which does not affect binding to β2-spectrin (Fig. 1C), is localized as wild-type GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B and also rescues β2-spectrin localization in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4B). In contrast, GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants that lack β2-spectrin binding (DAR976AAA and A1000P) did not rescue the localization of β2-spectrin, even though they were normally expressed and correctly targeted in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, direct binding of β2-spectrin to ankyrin-B is required for the normal targeting of β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Moreover, localization of ankyrin-B in cardiomyocytes occurs independently of β2-spectrin. Ankyrin-B-dependent Targeting of the InsP3 Receptor Is Independent of β2-Spectrin Activity—The role of β2-spectrin in ankyrin-B-dependent targeting of the InsP3 receptor was determined by rescue experiments using GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B mutants lacking β2-spectrin binding activity. Abnormal localization and expression of InsP3 receptor in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes are rescued by expression of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B (Fig. 5, A-C) (6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V.

GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B DAR976AAA or A1000P mutants that do not bind β2-spectrin do restore normal InsP3 receptor expression and localization (Fig. 5, D and E). In contrast, GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B EDE1082AAA is ineffective in restoring the localization of InsP3 receptor in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (InsP3 receptors are localized in small puncta throughout the cell), even though this mutant has full β2-spectrin binding activity (Fig. 1C) and rescues localization of β2-spectrin in ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that ankyrin-B-dependent activity in targeting InsP3 receptors in neonatal cardiomyocytes is independent of β2-spectrin. These results also demonstrate that neither the A1000P nor DAR976AAA mutations affect the folding of full-length ankyrin-B because these mutants are normally targeted and have full activity in rescuing InsP3 receptor localization. β2-Spectrin Is Not Required for Ankyrin-B-dependent Regulation of Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Contraction Rate—The role of β2-spectrin activity in ankyrin-B-dependent regulation of neonatal cardiomyocyte contraction rates (18Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was assessed using ankyrin-B DAR976AAA and A1000P mutants. Compared with wild-type neonatal cardiomyocytes, ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes display reduced spontaneous contraction rates and abnormal Ca2+ dynamics ((6Mohler P.J. Schott J.J. Gramolini A.O. Dilly K.W. Guatimosim S. duBell W.H. Song L.S. Haurogne K. Kyndt F. Ali M.E. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Escande D. Le Marec H. Bennett V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); Fig. 6). Abnormal contraction rates and abnormalities in Ca2+ dynamics (not shown) are restored by transfection of GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B but not GFP alone (Fig. 6). Ankyrin-B+/- neonatal cardiomyocytes transfected with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B A1000P or DAR976AAA restored ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocyte spontaneous contraction rates to normal levels (Fig. 6). In contrast, GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B EDE1082AAA was unable to rescue ankyrin-B+/- neonatal contraction rates (Fig. 6), even though this mutant maintained normal β2-spectrin binding activity (Fig. 1C). Together, our results demonstrate that interaction of ankyrin-B with β2-spectrin is not required for ankyrin-B-dependent targeting of InsP3 receptor or ankyrin-B-dependent regulation of cardiomyocyte Ca2+ dynamics and cellular contractility. Ankyrin-B and β2-Spectrin are Colocalized in an Intracellular Striated Compartment Distinct from Known Membrane Structures—We compared the localization of ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes using confocal microscopy. β2-Spectrin and ankyrin-B are colocalized in a transverse striated network in wild-type neonatal cardiomyocytes immunolabeled with affinity-purified antibodies (Fig. 7A). The localization of β2-spectrin and ankyrin-B was intracellular as assessed by three-dimensional reconstructions of a Z-stack of consecutive confocal scans obtained at intervals of 0.18 μm (see “Experimental Procedures”). β2-Spectrin overlaps with ankyrin-B over the M-line near the sarcolemma but also intracellularly throughout the cell (see Fig. 7, B and C; in C the image is rotated to observe intracellular colocalization). Additionally, we identified longitudinal ankyrin-B staining connecting M-line staining that was not coincident with β2-spectrin labeling (see red channel in Fig. 7C). Evidence that the striated network is intracellular is that a marker for the sarcolemma (Na/Ca exchanger) exhibits minimal overlap with β2-spectrin or ankyrin-B (Supplemental Fig. 1). Moreover, β2-spectrin and ankyrin-B exhibit precise juxtaposition in three-dimensional images with intracellular organelles (see below). Interestingly, intracellular striated ankyrin-B/β2-spectrin staining was distinct in three-dimensions from other striated markers including Z-lines (α-actinin, Fig. 8A), longitudinal and transverse sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2, not shown); also InsP3 receptors, ryanodine receptors (Fig. 8, C and D), calreticulin, not shown), and nascent T-tubules (dihydropyridine receptors, Fig. 8B). Ankyrin-B/β2-spectrin staining also is distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum (assessed by BiP/GRP78 staining, Fig. 9B), Golgi, (Golgin 97, Fig. 9A; also β-COP, not shown), endosomes (EEA1, Fig. 9, C and D), and lysosomes (LAMP1, not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin are colocalized in a distinct intracellular compartment of neonatal cardiomyocytes.Fig. 9Ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin staining is distinct from endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and early endosome markers in three dimensions. Seven-day cardiomyocytes cultures immunostained with antibodies to β2-spectrin and Golgin 97 (left), ankyrin-B and GRP78/BiP (center), and ankyrin-B and EEA1 (right) are shown. The scale bar equals 5 μm. The bottom panel shows images of localization of early endosome marker EEA1 with ankyrin-B immunostaining. Images are three-dimensional reconstructions of 10-20 Z-scans through the cardiomyocyte at 0.18-μm intervals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This work demonstrates that ankyrin-B is required for localization of β2-spectrin to an intracellular compartment in neonatal cardiomyocytes. β2-Spectrin is colocalized with ankyrin-B in a striated pattern overlaying the M-line. β2-Spectrin is absent in ankyrin-B-null cardiomyocytes and is restored to a normal striated pattern by rescue with GFP-220-kDa ankyrin-B. Ankyrin-B mutants lacking spectrin binding activity do not re-establish β2-spectrin but still are capable of restoring InsP3 receptor localization and normal contraction frequency of ankyrin-B+/- cardiomyocytes. Therefore, direct binding of β2-spectrin to ankyrin-B is required for the normal targeting of β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes. In contrast, ankyrin-B localization and function are independent of β2-spectrin. The finding that β2-spectrin requires ankyrin-B for cellular targeting in cardiomyocytes was not anticipated. Studies of assembly of the erythrocyte skeleton have concluded that ankyrin associates with a preassembled spectrin skeleton (25Woods C.M. Lazarides E. Annu. Rev. Med. 1988; 39: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, β-spectrins associate with phosphatidylinositol lipids through their pleckstrin homology domains (26Wang D.S. Shaw G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover β2-spectrin has ankyrin-independent membrane binding sites (19Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13550-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lombardo C.R. Weed S.A. Kennedy S.P. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4175-4181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The current findings do not exclude the possibility that ankyrin-independent interactions of β2-spectrin with proteins and phospholipids also contribute to its localization and function. It will be of interest to evaluate localization of mutant forms of β2-spectrin lacking these activities. A second surprising conclusion of this work is that β2-spectrin and ankyrin-B are in an intracellular compartment completely distinct from Golgi. Polypeptides immunoreactive with ankyrin and spectrin have been observed associated with Golgi at the level of immunofluorescence (31Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2331-2343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the source of the spectrin-related Golgi staining recently has been identified as nesprin-1β/syne-1B (34Gough L.L. Fan J. Chu S. Winnick S. Beck K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2410-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a large protein with spectrin repeats but not a member of the β-spectrin family (35Apel E.D. Lewis R.M. Grady R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31986-31995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). β3-Spectrin has been associated with markers for the Golgi (36Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14158-14163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, 119-kDa ankyrin-G is localized in a subcellular pattern that overlaps with Golgi markers in subconfluent Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (37Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to evaluate localization of β3-spectrin and 119-kDa ankyrin-G using the three-dimensional rendering and high resolution confocal microscopy methods employed in this work. A third unexpected finding was that β2-spectrin is not required for ankyrin-B-dependent activity in targeting InsP3 receptors in cardiomyocytes. Spectrin and ankyrin function collaboratively in stabilizing the plasma membrane of erythrocytes (12Eber S.W. Gonzalez J.M. Lux M.L. Scarpa A.L. Tse W.T. Dornwell M. Herbers J. Kugler W. Ozcan R. Pekrun A. Gallagher P.G. Schroter W. Forget B.G. Lux S.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 13Hanspal M. Yoon S.H. Yu H. Hanspal J.S. Lambert S. Palek J. Prchal J.T. Blood. 1991; 77: 165-173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bodine 4th, D.M. Birkenmeier C.S. Barker J.E. Cell. 1984; 37: 721-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, the phenotype of βIV spectrin-deficient mice is similar although less severe than ankyrin-G mutant mice (3Zhou D. Lambert S. Malen P.L. Carpenter S. Boland L.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 4Jenkins S.M. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 15Komada M. Soriano P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that our results were obtained using cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes and may not necessarily extend to neonatal heart tissue or to adult cardiomyocytes. It is of interest in this regard that loss of the sole β2-spectrin ortholog in C. elegans is compatible with normal embryonic morphogenesis but not with survival after hatching (38Moorthy S. Chen L. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 915-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Hammarlund M. Davis W.S. Jorgensen E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice homozygous for a null mutation in β2-spectrin display cardiac abnormalities as well as other defects and die in midgestation, consistent with a critical role for β2-spectrin in the heart (40Tang Y. Katuri V. Dillner A. Mishra B. Deng C.X. Mishra L. Science. 2003; 299: 574-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). One possible role for β2-spectrin in cardiomyocytes would be to provide a mechanical protection for the ankyrin-B compartment during cardiac contractions. Such a stabilizing function would not necessarily be important under conditions of tissue culture but could be critical in the context of an actively beating heart. This work defines the minimal spectrin binding domain as a sequence highly conserved in ankyrin polypeptides and encompassing a predicted ZU5 domain (smart.embl-heidelberg.de). This domain is also present in the tight junction protein ZO-1 and Unc5 netrin receptor (41Ackerman S.L. Kozak L.P. Przyborski S.A. Rund L.A. Boyer B.B. Knowles B.B. Nature. 1997; 386: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 42Leonardo E.D. Hinck L. Masu M. Keino-Masu K. Ackerman S.L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Nature. 1997; 386: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), although the level of homology is low, and these proteins do not have spectrin binding activity (data not shown). Interestingly, the computer-predicted ZU5 domain in ankyrin-B (residues 966-1070) did not interact with β2-spectrin. However, full-spectrin binding occurred when we extended the boundaries of the ZU5 domain to 966-1125 based on a similar sequence flanking the ZU5 domain of Unc5. Ankyrins associate with β1- and β2-spectrins with 2-3-fold different affinities (19Davis J.Q. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13550-13559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bennett V. Davis J. Fowler W.E. Nature. 1982; 299: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), which raises the question of whether the minimal spectrin binding domain retains the ability to distinguish between spectrin isoforms. It is of interest in this regard that deletion of the N-terminal residues of the ankyrin-R spectrin binding domain results in a 20-fold loss of affinity from 10 to 200 nm (24Davis L.H. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would still register as a positive in yeast two-hybrid assays. It will be important to compare binding affinities of the minimal and full-length spectrin binding domains in biochemical assays. In summary, this work demonstrates that interaction between members of the ankyrin and β-spectrin families previously established in erythrocytes and axon initial segments also occurs in neonatal cardiomyocytes with ankyrin-B and β2-spectrin. This work also establishes a functional hierarchy in which ankyrin-B determines the localization of β2-spectrin and operates independently of β2-spectrin in its role in organizing membrane-spanning proteins. The supportive downstream role for β2-spectrin in neonatal cardiomyocytes is consistent with results in C. elegans, where loss of β-spectrin is compatible with normal embryonic development. Such a “division of labor” between ankyrin and spectrin makes teleological sense considering the high level of diversity in protein interactions of ankyrin caused by ANK repeats and the properties of spectrin that allow formation of two-dimensional networks with actin. In contrast to erythrocytes and neurons, where ankyrins and spectrins are attached to the plasma membrane, the ankyrin-B-β2-spectrin complex of cardiomyocytes is associated with intracellular membranes. The ankyrin-B-β2-spectrin compartment is distinct from known organelles or striated membrane compartments at the level of light microscopy. Elucidation of the composition and functions of the ankyrin-B-β2-spectrin compartment as well as its evolutionary connection with the plasma membrane will be important goals for future research.

We show that a cell line derived from murine renal IM cells responds to moderate hyperosmotic stress (540 mosmol/kg) by activation of G2/M arrest without significant apoptosis. If the severity of hyperosmotic stress exceeds the tolerance limit of this cell line (620 mosmol/kg) apoptosis is strongly induced. Using transient overexpression of ectopic Gadd45 proteins and simultaneous analysis of transfected versus non-transfected cells by laser-scanning cytometry, we were able to measure the effects of Gadd45 super-induction during hyperosmolality on G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that induction of all three Gadd45 isoforms inhibits mitosis and promotes G2/M arrest during moderate hyperosmotic stress but not in isosmotic controls. Furthermore, all three Gadd45 proteins are also involved in control of apoptosis during severe hyperosmotic stress. Under these conditions Gadd45γ induction strongly potentiates apoptosis. In contrast, Gadd45α/β induction transiently increases caspase 3/7 and annexin V binding before 12 h but inhibits later stages of apoptosis during severe hyperosmolality. These results show that Gadd45 isoforms function in common but also in distinct pathways during hyperosmolality and that their increased abundance contributes to the low mitotic index and protection of genomic integrity in cells of the mammalian renal inner medulla.

We have shown that these cells induce all three Gadd45 isoforms during hyperosmotic stress via posttranscriptional mechanisms (1Kültz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol.

Gadd45α was initially discovered based on its induction in hamster cells exposed to ionizing radiation stress (3Fornace Jr., A.J. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Gadd45β was cloned a few years later and initially described as myeloid differentiation immediate early gene MyD118 (4Abdollahi A. Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 165-167PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, GADD45γ was described under different names, including GADD45γ (5Takekawa M. Saito H.

Despite their hyperosmotic induction, functional consequences of Gadd45 up-regulation in cells exposed to osmotic stress are unknown. Potential Gadd45 functions during environmental stress include promotion of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair (10Sheikh M.S. Hollander M.C. Fornance Jr., A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). All of these cell functions are altered during hyperosmolality (1Kültz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol.

To assess the mechanistic relevance of hyperosmotic Gadd45 induction, it is necessary to determine which of these cell functions are altered as a result of increased levels of each of the three mammalian Gadd45 isoforms. The present study addresses the question of how super-induction of Gadd45α, Gadd45β, and Gadd45γ during hyperosmotic stress affects cell proliferation and apoptosis. Renal IM cells exposed to hyperosmolality undergo growth arrest in G2 phase of the cell cycle (1Kültz D. Madhany S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13645-13651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Dmitrieva N.I. Bulavin D.V. Fornace Jr., A.J. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This hyperosmotic cell cycle delay is likely a consequence of activation of DNA damage checkpoints because hyperosmolality causes multiple forms of DNA damage (13Kültz D. Chakravarty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Dmitrieva N.I. Cai Q. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2004; 101: 9491-9496Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, whether any of the three Gadd45 isoforms plays a role in mediating hyperosmotic G2/M arrest remains unclear. A direct role of Gadd45 in cell cycle checkpoint pathways responsible for G2/M arrest has been demonstrated in human keratinocytes exposed to UV radiation and alkylating agents, where it inhibits the activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex (18Zhan Q.M. Antinore M.J. Wang X.W. Carrier F. Smith M.L. Harris C.C. Forance A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2892-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 19Maeda T. Hanna A.N. Sim A.B. Chua P.P. Chong M.T. Tron V.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 22-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gadd45β and Gadd45γ are also Cdc2/cyclin B1 inhibitors that are involved in controlling the G2/M checkpoint (20Vairapandi M. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, one goal of the present study was to investigate whether increases of any Gadd45 isoform during hyperosmotic stress inhibit mitosis and promote G2 arrest. The role of Gadd45 proteins for the regulation of apoptosis is controversial and may depend on cell type and the nature of the environmental stimulus that triggers apoptosis. For instance, in medulloblastoma cells Gadd45α induces apoptosis in response to nerve growth factor stimulation independent of the p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathways (21Chou T.T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41120-41127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas in UV-irradiated skin tumors its stimulation of apoptosis depends on p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity (22Hildesheim J. Bulavin D.V. Anver M.R. Alvord W.G. Hollander M.C. Vardanian L. Fornace A.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7305-7315PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Gadd45α in human fibroblasts does not induce apoptosis nor does it alter p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activity (10Sheikh M.S. Hollander M.C. Fornance Jr., A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, radiation-induced apoptosis or activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathways is not inhibited in Gadd45α-deficient mice (10Sheikh M.S. Hollander M.C. Fornance Jr., A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 43-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Gadd45β has similarly wide-ranging effects on apoptosis as Gaddd45α. For instance, Gadd45β inhibits apoptosis caused by tumor necrosis factor-α by mediating inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway via the NF-κB pathway (23De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 24Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Bubici C. Jayawardena S. Alvarez K. Matsuda S.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), but it promotes apoptosis caused by TGFβ via activation of the p38 pathway (25Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Gadd45γ also activates the p38 pathway in some cell types, indicating that this third Gadd45 isoform plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis during cellular stress (26Chi H.B. Lu B.F. Takekawa M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, a second goal of the present study was to determine how increased levels of each of the three Gadd45 proteins modulate apoptosis during exposure of renal IM cells to hyperosmolality. Cell Culture, Cell Proliferation, and Cell Integrity Assays—Murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD3) cells of passage 18 were used for all experiments (27Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture medium consisted of 45% Ham's F-12, 45% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 milliunits/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all reagents were from Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Final medium osmolality of isosmotic medium was 300 ± 5 mosmol/kg of H2O. Hyperosmotic media were prepared by the addition of an appropriate amount of NaCl to isosmotic medium to yield medium osmolalities of 540, 600, 620, and 625 mosmol/kg of H2O. Final osmolality of all media was verified with a microosmometer (Model 3300, Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). Cells were synchronized by serum deprivation for 24 h before hyperosmotic treatment. Cell proliferation was assayed using WST-1 reagent according to manufacturer instructions (Roche Applied Science). Absorbance was measured using a Spectrafluor Plus microplate reader (Tecan, Durham, NC). Cell integrity was assayed by lactate dehydrogenase leakage quantification using Cytotox-ONE™ reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Fluorescence was measured at 560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths using the Spectrafluor Plus microplate reader. For cell proliferation and cell integrity assays cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nalge-Nunc, Rochester, NY). For fluorescence-based Cytotox-ONE assay black-walled microtiter plates were used to avoid interference of fluorescence signal between wells. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle stages were analyzed by laser-scanning cytometry (LSC, CompuCyte, Cambridge, MA) after fixing cells grown on 8-chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc) and staining with propidium iodide (PI) as previously described (28Dmitrieva N. Kültz D. Michea L. Ferraris J. Burg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18243-18247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, mitotic cells were identified and quantified by bivariate LSC analysis after immunohistochemical processing of slides using phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) primary antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA; catalog #06-570, 1:100 in PBS) and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; catalog #A11034, 1:100 in PBS) as previously described (16Dmitrieva N.I. Bulavin D.V. Fornace Jr., A.J. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Analysis of Apoptosis—Early apoptosis was quantified using caspase 3/7 activity and annexin V binding assays. Caspase 3/7 activity of mixed cell populations was measured with an Apo-ONE™ assay (Promega) after culturing cells in black-walled 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates. The assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured at 485-nm excitation and 535-nm emission wavelengths using a Tecan Spectrafluor Plus microplate reader. Cell-specific caspase 3/7 activity was determined by LSC analysis after growing cells in 8-chamber slides. After exposure to different osmolalities, cells were treated with 10 μm carboxyfluorescein-labeled caspase 3/7-specific inhibitor (FAM-DEVD-FMK) obtained from Immunohistochemistry Technologies (Bloomington, IN). Cells were rinsed briefly with PBS, fixed for 2 h with 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and rinsed again briefly with PBS. After counterstaining slides with PI, caspase 3/7 activity in each cell was quantified by scanning slides with the LSC using an argon laser (488 nm excitation) and standard settings of the green and orange/red LSC channel emission filter. Cell-specific annexin V binding to the outer cell membrane was also determined by LSC analysis after growing cells in 8-chamber slides. After exposure to different osmolalities, cells were washed twice in PBS and stained with annexin V conjugated to either fluorescein or Alexa 647 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) as previously described (29Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P. Kuijten G.A. Keehnen R.M. Pals S.T. van Oers M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed for 15 min in 1% methanol-free formaldehyde, and annexin V binding to the outer cell membrane was quantified by scanning slides with the LSC using an argon laser (488-nm excitation) and green LSC emission channel or a helium-neon laser (633-nm excitation) and far-red LSC emission channel. When using Alexa 488, conjugate cells were counterstained with PI. For Alexa 647 conjugate, Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for nuclear counterstaining. This approach was validated by co-localization of annexin V fluorescence and PI fluorescence in unfixed cells that are only penetrated by PI when they are dead (apoptotic). Late apoptosis was quantified by DNA strand break labeling (TUNEL) assay as previously described (30Li X. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cell Prolif. 1995; 28: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 1% methanol-free formaldehyde for 15 min, incubated in 70% ethanol at -20 °C for at least 1 h, and rinsed twice for 5 min with PBS. DNA strand breaks were then labeled with APO-Direct reagents, including fluorescein-dUTP with the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, as instructed by the manufacturer (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Green fluorescence per cell was measured by LSC using an argon laser (488-nm excitation) and green LSC emission channel. Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Cloning and Expression of Epitope-tagged Gadd45 Genes in Renal Cells—Total RNA from mIMCD3 cells was extracted as previously described (2Chakravarty D. Cai Q. Ferraris J.D. Michea L. Burg M.B. Kültz D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283: 1020-1029Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript III first strand synthesis reagents (Invitrogen). PCR primer pairs for full-length cloning of Gadd45 were designed using Vector NTI 9 software (Informax, Frederick, MD) and GenBank™ numbers NM_ 007836, NM_008655, and NM_011817 as templates: Gadd45α, 1-GAG-GGACTCGCACTTGCAATA, 2-TCCGGGAGATTAATCACGGGC; Gadd45β, 1-CTGTGGAGTGTGACTGCATCAT, 2-GCGTTCCTCTAGAGA-GATATAG; Gadd45γ, 1-CTTGCTGTTCGTGGATCGCAC, 2-CTCGGG-AAGGGTGATGCTG. PCR products were directly cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) and propagated in Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen). Endotoxin-free plasmid Mega-preps were performed using a kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Transient transfections were carried out by mixing 2 μg of plasmid DNA with 4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 8-chamber slides, and cells were allowed to express recombinant protein during a 24-h incubation period before dosing at different osmolalities. Transfection efficiency was similar in all samples (∼5%) as determined by LSC analysis of V5-positive cells versus total the number of cells (see “Discussion”). Compartmentation of Epitope-tagged Gadd45 in Transfected Cells—Recombinant Gadd45 proteins were detected using an antibody against the V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen; catalog #R960-25, 1:250 in PBS) and Alexa 488 conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibody (Molecular Probes; catalog #A11029, 1:100 in PBS). After immunocytochemistry, nuclei were counterstained with PI. Bivariate LSC analysis was carried out using excitation with argon ion laser at 400 nm in combination with green and orange emission filter photomultiplier tubes. For some experiments Hoechst 33342 DNA stain was used for nuclear counterstaining instead of PI. In these cases, bivariate LSC analysis was performed using argon ion laser excitation at 488 nm and violet diode laser excitation at 400 nm in combination with green and violet emission filter photomultiplier tubes. Differential Laser-scanning Cytometry of Transfected Cells—LSC technology is ideal for analyzing mixed populations of cells. We applied this feature of LSC for differential analysis of transfected and nontransfected cells in the same sample. Trivariate LSC analysis was performed as follows. First, cells were probed with FAM-SEVD-FMK (caspase 3/7 activity), annexin V, or fluorescein-dUTP. All three probes contained a green fluorescent label, either fluorescein or Alexa 488 as described above. Then slides were kept in 70% ethanol at -20 °C for at least 1 h, washed briefly with PBS, and processed for immunocytochemistry with anti-V5 epitope-tag antibody (Invitrogen, catalog #R960-25, 1:250 in PBS) and Alexa 647 conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, catalog #A21236, 1:100 in PBS). Finally, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 DNA stain. The three fluorophores (fluorescein/Alexa 488, Alexa 647, and Hoechst 33342) were chosen to yield minimally overlapping emission spectra. Trivariate LSC analysis was performed using an argon ion laser (488 nm) for exciting fluorescein/Alexa 488, helium neon laser (633 nm) for exciting Alexa 647, and violet diode laser (400 nm) for exciting Hoechst 33342 during slide scanning. Fluorescence was recorded using violet, green, and far-red emission filter photomultiplier tubes of the LSC. Statistics—Data analysis was carried out with SPSS software. Differences between pairs of data were analyzed by the F-test followed by a paired t test. The significance threshold was set at p < 0.05, and values shown represent the means of at least three independent replicates. At least 5000 cells were analyzed for each sample for LSC-based approaches. Hyperosmolality Inhibits Cell Proliferation by Growth Arrest and Apoptosis—Exposure of mIMCD3 cells to hyperosmotic medium causes growth arrest that lasts for about 1 day. After a day cell number increase resumes (Fig. 1A). The rate of cell number increase depends on the severity of hyperosmolality, fast at 540 mosmol/kg and slow at 620 mosmol/kg (Fig. 1A). The slow rate of cell doubling in 620 mosmol/kg of medium can at least in part be attributed to accelerated cell death (Fig. 1B). To assess whether cell proliferation rates are also affected by hyperosmolality, we analyzed individual cell cycle stages. Moderate hyperosmolality (540 mosmol/kg) causes an increase of cells in G2 and a decrease in S-phase cells relative to isosmotic controls (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, severe hyperosmolality induces G1 arrest and apoptotic DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2C). The induction of G2 arrest by moderate hyperosmolality is significant at 6 and 24 h, but the decrease in S phase cells becomes significant only at 24 h (Fig. 2, D and E). During severe hyperosmolality, apoptotic cell numbers increase, and S phase cell numbers decrease significantly at 6 and 24 h, but significant G1 arrest is only apparent at 24 h. These results demonstrate that moderate hyperosmolality (540 mosmol/kg) only causes G2 arrest but no apoptosis, whereas severe hyperosmolality approaching the osmotic tolerance limit of mIMCD3 cells causes some G1 arrest but mostly apoptosis.Fig. 2Hyperosmolality delays the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in mIMCD3 cells. Representative LSC cytograms based on propidium iodide integral nuclear fluorescence are shown for cells grown for 24 h in medium of 300 mosmol/kg of H2O (A), 540 mosmol/kg of H2O (B), and 620 mosmol/kg of H2O (C). D, comparison of mean portions of cells in each major phase of the cell cycle after 6 h of exposure to 300, 540, and 620 mosmol/kg of H2O. E, comparison of mean portions of cells in each major phase of the cell cycle after 24 h of exposure to 300, 540, and 620 mosmol/kg of H2O. An asterisk illustrates a significant effect of hyperosmolality on the portion of cells in a particular phase of the cell cycle.

Expressed Gadd45 proteins were detected by immunocytochemistry and LSC. All three isoforms of Gadd45 proteins are distributed evenly in the cytosol, but their concentration is highest in the nucleus (Fig. 3). This compartmentation profile resembles wild-type Gadd45 and confirms that the level of recombinant Gadd45 expression is consistent with normal processing of the protein. Nuclear co-localization of Gadd45 proteins and PI or Hoechst 33342 DNA stain enabled us to quantify the percentage of transfected cells using the LSC (Fig. 4). Transfection efficiency was ∼5% in all experiments and not influenced by subsequent treatment of cells in hyperosmotic media (data not shown). Triple staining of mIMCD3 cells with nuclear DNA counterstain, Gadd45-V5 antibody, and fluorophores that are markers for mitosis and apoptosis made it possible to quantify hyperosmotic effects on mitosis and apoptosis in transfected cells that overexpress Gadd45 (Fig. 4). In addition, we were able to compare these data directly with hyperosmotic effects on mitosis and apoptosis in non-transfected cells in the same sample treated under identical conditions (Fig. 4). This method represents a powerful new way of analyzing properties of transiently transfected cells.Fig. 4Differential laser-scanning cytometry enables direct comparison of transfected versus non-transfected cells in the same sample. Cells grown in eight-chamber slides were evaluated by trivariate LSC analysis of Hoechst 33342 (violet), FAM-DEVD-FMK (green), and Gadd45-V5 (far-red) fluorescence. A, each chamber on the slide contained cells grown in either iso- or hyperosmotic medium and was analyzed separately. B, scattergram displaying the area and Hoechst 33342 content of cells. C, histogram displaying numbers of cells in different cell cycle stages. D, scattergram displaying Gadd45-V5-positive (transfected) cells defined as cells exceeding maximum pixel fluorescence of 4000 units. These cells representing ∼5% of the total cell population are labeled blue in all panels. Untransfected cells in the same sample are labeled orange in all panels E, scattergram showing FAM-DEVD-FMK fluorescence in non-transfected cells. FLICA-positive cells were defined as cells exceeding maximum pixel fluorescence of 4000 units. F, scattergram showing FAM-DEVD-FMK fluorescence in transfected cells. In this example 8.9% of transfected cells are apoptotic (compared with 4.9% of non-transfected cells (E)) based on positive FAM-DEVD-FMK staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Gadd45 Inhibits Mitosis during Hyperosmolality—Cells in prophase, metaphase, and telophase of mitosis can be identified with an antibody against phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) (Fig. 5A). To investigate how Gadd45 overexpression affects mitosis during hyperosmolality, we stained transfected cells with antibodies against the V5 epitope of Gadd45 and against phospho-histone H3 (Ser-10) and counterstained with propidium iodide. Mitotic cells in transfected and non-transfected cells were analyzed by LSC. Hyperosmolality consistently decreases the number of mitotic cells by 5-10% after 6 h and 10-30% after 24 h in all experiments (Fig. 5, B-E). Overexpression of different Gadd45 isoforms has similar effects on mitosis during hyperosmolality. All three Gadd45 isoforms significantly potentiate the inhibitory effect of hyperosmolality on mitosis (Fig. 5, B-D). Gadd45-induced inhibition of mitosis was observed at moderate (540 mosmol/kg) and severe (620 mosmol/kg) hyperosmolality but not in isosmotic medium. In contrast, overexpression of a control (LacZ) from the same plasmid has no significant effect on the number of mitotic cells (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that Gadd45 induction contributes to growth arrest during hyperosmotic stress. Gadd45 Promotes Early Apoptotic Events during Hyperosmolality—Because severe hyperosmolality also causes apoptosis, we investigated whether Gadd45 induction at 620 mosmol/kg modulates apoptosis. Early apoptosis was monitored by measuring caspase 3/7 activity. The time course of caspase 3/7 activity measured with a fluorescence-based microplate assay shows that significant hyperosmotic caspase activation takes place within 6 h (Fig. 6A). In addition, caspase 3/7 activity was also measured by LSC (Fig. 6B). The time course of hyperosmotic caspase 3/7 activation as measured by LSC confirms that a significant activity increase takes place within 6 h (Fig. 6C). Of interest, despite the low number of apoptotic cells after 24 h at 540 mosmol/kg (Figs. 1, 2, and 6), we observed a significant increase in caspase 3/7 activity for up to 12 h at this osmolality. Effects of Gadd45 overexpression on caspase 3/7 activation were evaluated by trivariate LSC analysis. The results show a slight but insignificant increase of caspase 3/7 activity in response to overexpression of each Gadd45 isoform in isosmotic medium (Fig. 6D). However, when cells are exposed to hyperosmotic medium (620 mosmol/kg) for 4 h, Gadd45 overexpressi"

Adenoviral-mediated expression of constitutively active forms of either pathway induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α, a transcriptional coactivator involved in the control of multiple cellular energy metabolic pathways in cardiac myocytes. Transcriptional profiling studies demonstrated that Cn and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activate distinct but overlapping metabolic gene regulatory programs. Expression of the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, was markedly increased by Cn, but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, providing one mechanism whereby cellular fatty acid utilization genes are selectively activated by Cn. Transfection experiments demonstrated that Cn directly activates the mouse peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α gene promoter. Co-transfection “add-back” experiments demonstrated that the transcription factors, myocyte enhancer factors 2C or 2D, were sufficient to confer Cn-mediated activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α gene. Cn was also shown to directly activate a known peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α target, muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, providing a second mechanism by which Cn activates genes of cellular fatty acid utilization. Lastly, the gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α was reduced in the hearts of mice with cardiac-specific ablation of the Cn regulatory subunit. These data support a role for calcium-triggered signaling pathways in the regulation of cardiac energetics and identify pathway-specific control of metabolic targets.

Skeletal muscle fiber types are defined by contractile protein isoform composition and energy metabolic properties. Slow-twitch muscle fibers possess greater mitochondrial volume supporting higher oxidative metabolic capacity compared with fast-twitch fibers. Muscle metabolic phenotype is plastic, responding to numerous external stimuli. Calcium signaling serves an important role in the adaptive response of skeletal muscle to external stimuli, including fiber type determination. Evidence has emerged that calcium-triggered regulatory pathways acting through Cn (Cn), 1The abbreviations used are: Cn, Cn; FA, fatty acid; CaMK, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV; CsA, cyclosporine; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NRF-1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; SRF, serum response factor; M-CPT I, muscle-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase I; MCAD, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; α-MHC, α myosin heavy chain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RLU, relative light unit(s); RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK), serve a major role in determining the functional and metabolic phenotype of skeletal muscle by transducing alterations in cytosolic calcium concentration. In support of this, Chin et al. (1Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a constitutively active form of Cn (Cn*) is capable of activating transcription of slow fiber-specific gene promoters. Similarly, overexpression of Cn* in skeletal muscle results in an increase in slow muscle fiber types (2Naya F.J. Mercer B. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Williams R.S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4545-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and in CnAα and Aβ null mice there is a reduction in slow muscle fiber type composition (3Parsons S.A.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), although controversy remains because other groups have found no effect of Cn inhibition on fiber type differentiation (6Schiaffino S. Serrano A.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 569-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A constitutively active form of CaMK IV (CaMK*) was shown to activate transcription of slow fiber-specific gene promoters and overexpression in skeletal muscle activated the slow-twitch fiber program and mitochondrial biogenesis in transgenic mice (7Wu H. Kanatous S.B. Thurmond F.A. Gallardo T. Isotani E. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Science. 2002; 296: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These data support a role for Cn and CaMK in the transduction of increased muscle activity to adaptive structural and metabolic gene regulatory responses. Recent studies have identified the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) as a mediator of Cn/CaMK signaling in the regulation of skeletal muscle fiber type switches and mitochondrial energy metabolism. PGC-1α is an inducible coactivator of numerous nuclear receptor and non-nuclear receptor transcription factors known to control distinct components of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Through its activation of specific transcription factors, PGC-1α has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial capacity in oxidative tissues such as brown adipose, skeletal muscle, and heart (8Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 78-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). PGC-1α has been shown to coactivate nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), a critical regulator of nuclear and mitochondrial genes involved in respiratory function and mitochondrial DNA replication (9Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3229) Google Scholar). PGC-1α has also been shown to coactivate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in cellular fatty acid utilization (10Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The expression of PGC-1α is in turn regulated by upstream signaling events, including Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways (11Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). Specifically, Cn and CaMK have been shown to activate PGC-1α gene transcription through myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and cAMP response element-binding protein (12Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tam P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in transgenic mice skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of Cn* or CaMK* results in increased expression of PGC-1α (7Wu H. Kanatous S.B. Thurmond F.A. Gallardo T. Isotani E. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Science. 2002; 296: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 13Ryder J.W. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Zierath J.R. J. Biol.

In contrast to skeletal muscle, the downstream metabolic effects of Cn and CaMK in cardiac muscle has not been characterized. It is not known if PGC-1α is downstream of Cn or CaMK in cardiac myocytes. Unlike skeletal muscle, forced expression of constitutively active forms of Cn or CaMK in cardiac muscle results in profound hypertrophy, heart failure, and death (14Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L.

Isolated mitochondria from Cn*-expressing hearts demonstrated impaired oxidative function (16Sayen M.R. Gustafsson Å. B. Sussman M.A. Molkentin J.D. Gottlieb R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C562-C570Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These latter observations are inconsistent with the known metabolic responses in skeletal muscle given that, during pathological hypertrophic growth, the heart undergoes a reversion to a fetal energy metabolic program characterized by reduction of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and fatty acid utilization (17Sack M.N.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In contrast, with physiological forms of hypertrophy such as following exercise training, Cn and CaMK are activated yet both contractile and metabolic function is preserved (20Eto Y. Yonekura K. Sonoda M. Arai N. Sata M. Sugiura S. Takenaka K. Gualberto A. Hixon M.L. Wagner M.W. Aoyagi T. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2134-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results raise an enigma as to the true role of Cn and CaMK in the regulation of cardiac metabolism. We sought to address several questions with this study: (i) Do Cn and/or CaMK activate PGC-1α expression in cardiac myocytes? (ii) What are the downstream targets of Cn and CaMK in cardiac muscle? and (iii) Do Cn and CaMK control distinct or redundant cellular responses? We found that Cn and CaMK activate PGC-1α and distinct but overlapping downstream metabolic programs known to increase cardiac energy producing capacity. We also show that Cn, but not CaMK, directly activates expression of the PPARα gene, a key transcriptional regulator of cellular fatty acid utilization, providing at least one mechanism for differential regulation of downstream metabolic genes by these signaling pathways.

Reporter Constructs—PGC.Luc.2112 was generated by PCR amplification followed by cloning into pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison WI). PCR was performed using a BAC clone (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) as template. Primers were engineered to include Mlu1 (5′) and BglII (3′) sites. The primers used to amplify the construct were: 1) 5′ primer: 5′-ATAAACATCGACGCGTTATAGCTAAGTG-3′ and 3′ primer: 5′-AATGACGCCAGTAGATCTTTTTCAACT-3′. The human PPARα promoter construct (Pα(H-H)-pGL3), a gift from Bart Staels (Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille, France), has been described elsewhere (21Pineda Torra I. Jamshidi Y. Flavell D.M.

Adenoviral Expression Vectors—Adenovirus expressing both green fluorescent protein and constitutively active human CaMK IV was created by subcloning from the RSV-CaMKIV* into pAdTrackCMV as described previously (23He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). The adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein and constitutively active murine Cn was a gift from R. Sanders Williams and Rick Vega (University of Texas Southwestern). C2C12 myoblasts were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were harvested and maintained as previously described (19Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were maintained as previously described (24Leone T.C. Cresci S. Carter M.E. Zhang Z. Lala D.S. Strauss A.W. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16308-16314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For all cell types, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described (25Disch D.L. Rader T.A. Cresci S. Leone T.C. Barger P.M. Vega R. Wood P.A. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, reporter plasmids (4 μg/ml) were co-transfected with SV-40 β-galactosidase (500 ng/ml) to control for transfection efficiency and the appropriate mammalian expression vector (500 ng/ml) or its corresponding empty vector. After transfection, for C2C12 cells, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 10% horse serum to promote differentiation. Cells were harvested 72 h later in cell lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured as previously described (22Brandt J. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). All transfection data are presented as means (±S.E.) of at least three separate transfection experiments done in triplicate. Virus production was carried out in the packaging 293HEK cell line. Adenoviral expression constructs were transiently transfected into the cells by use of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Virus produced from this transient transfection was used to infect 293GPG cells to produce a population of virus-producing cells. Virus produced from these cells was concentrated by centrifugation of cells in a minimal volume of Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by lysis of the cells with repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Primary cardiac myocytes were infected with adenovirus 24 h after initial plating at a multiplicity of infection sufficient to infect >95% of the cells based on green fluorescent protein fluorescence with minimal cell drop out. After infection, cells were maintained for 72 h in differentiation media as described (19Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from either adenovirus-infected cells or whole hearts using the RNAzol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) method. Northern blot analysis was performed with QuikHyb (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using random-primed 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The probes were derived from cDNAs encoding mouse PGC-1α, mouse PPARα, rat M-CPT I, mouse MCAD, and human β-actin. Band intensities were quantified by phosphorimaging using a GS 525 Molecular Imager System (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the expression of β-actin. For Western blotting studies to detect CnB, protein extracts were prepared from both ventricles as described (26Cresci S. Wright L.D. Spratt J.A. Briggs F.N. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1413-C1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blotting was performed using an antibody directed against the CnB subunit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or actin (Sigma). Band intensities were quantified by densitometric analysis, and CnB signal was normalized to actin levels. First-strand cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using 500 ng of total RNA. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system and the TaqMan kit following the manufacturer's protocols (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). FAM-labeled probes with corresponding upstream and downstream primer sets (shown below) were designed using the Primer Express software package and tailored to span exon splice borders. Arbitrary units of target mRNA were corrected by measuring the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA in the same PCR reaction with a VIC-labeled probe. The following mouse specific primer/probe set was used to detect specific gene expression: PGC-1α forward, 5′-CGGAAATCATATCCAACCAG-3′; PGC-1α reverse, 5′-TGAGGACCGCTAGCAAGTTTG-3′; PGC-1α probe, 5′-TCATTCTCTTCATCTACTTTCTCAAATATGTTCGCAGG-3′. Rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (VIC) probe set was included in all reactions as internal correction control (Applied Biosystems). RNA isolated from cardiocytes after adenoviral infection was cleaned with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 12 μg of total RNA that was first reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen), using a T7 promoter poly(A) primer (T7T24), followed by second strand synthesis according to the manufacturer's protocol. Biotin labeled cRNA was synthesized using a T7-coupled Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were hybridized to the RatU34A microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) by the Alvin Siteman Cancer Center's Multiplexed Gene Analysis Core at the Washington University School of Medicine. Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software was used for the initial data analysis and background normalization. Sample intensity was standardized to the average intensity for all probe sets across different microarrays before comparisons. Probe sets that were considered “absent” in all conditions were removed from the data set. Genes from the experimental conditions were then normalized to expression in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-infected controls to determine relative induction. Three independent trials were performed. Signal intensity ratios of >2-fold (induced) or <50% (repressed) in at least two trials were considered regulated by Cn or CaMK as were those genes that were induced from being absent in GFP to present in Cn/CaMK treatment (“P”) or repressed from being present in GFP to absent in Cn/CaMK (“A”). Heart-specific ablation of Cnb1 was achieved by crossing mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter (a gift from Michael Schneider, Baylor University, Houston, TX) (27Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) with mice carrying a floxed Cnb1 allele (a gift from Gerald R. Crabtree, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) (28Neilson J.R. Winslow M.M. Hur E.M. Crabtree G.R. Immunity. 2004; 20: 255-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exons 3–5 of Cnb1 are flanked by loxP sites in this allele, leading to the deletion of these exons and the inactivation of Cnb1 in Cre-expressing cells. Because Cnb1 encodes the only non-testis isoform of the indispensable regulatory subunit of Cn, deletion of Cnb1 results in the absence of Cn function in the affected cells. All animal experiments and euthanasia protocols were conducted in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane treatment of laboratory animals. All animal experiment protocols were reviewed and approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University. The data are presented as means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effect of infection or transfection on mRNA or luciferase levels in cell culture studies. Individual mean differences were assessed using the Student-Newman-Keuls method. Unpaired t-tests were used for evaluating the effect of Cre-recombinase on gene expression in the animal studies. An α level of 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. Cn and CaM Kinase Induce PGC-1α Gene Expression in Cardiac Myocytes—To investigate the effects of Cn and CaM kinase on PGC-1α expression in cardiac myocytes, primary neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing adenoviral vectors expressing a constitutively active form of either Cn A (Ad.Cn*) or CaMK IV (Ad.CaMK*). PGC-1α transcript levels in Ad.Cn*-and Ad.CaMK*-infected cells were compared with that in control cells expressing GFP alone (Ad.GFP). PGC-1α mRNA levels were significantly increased by Ad.Cn* (3-fold) or Ad.CaMK* (7-fold) (Fig. 1A). Additive effects were not observed by simultaneous infection with both constructs (data not shown). To determine whether this regulatory effect occurred at the transcriptional level, transient co-transfection assays were performed in ventricular myocytes with a luciferase reporter vector driven by 2112 bp of the mouse PGC-1α gene promoter (PGC.Luc.2112) and expression plasmids for Cn* and/or CaMK*. Cn* induced a significant (3-fold) increase in reporter activity (Fig. 1B), which was reversed upon treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA), a specific inhibitor of Cn. CsA also reduced activity of the PGC-1α promoter by more than 50%, suggesting that its basal activity was influenced by Cn*. Surprisingly, overexpression of CaMK* did not increase reporter activity. This latter observation contrasts with C2C12 myotubes in which we found that addition of CaMK* activates the PGC-1α promoter similar to published reports (data not shown and Refs. 7Wu H. Kanatous S.B. Thurmond F.A. Gallardo T. Isotani E. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Science. 2002; 296: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar and 12Handschin C. Rhee J. Lin J. Tam P.T. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7111-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). These latter results suggest that for activation of PGC-1α gene expression by CaMK* in cardiac myocytes, crucial factors are lacking in neonatal cells, elements are lacking in the reporter construct, or post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved. Co-transfection of CaMK* with Cn* did not activate PGC.Luc.2112 more than Cn* alone, indicating a lack of cooperativity (Fig. 1B). Cn* and CaMK* Activate Distinct but Overlapping Gene Regulatory Programs in Cardiac Myocytes—To delineate the gene regulatory programs driven by Cn and CaMK in cardiac myocytes, transcriptional profiling experiments were performed using RNA isolated from neonatal cardiac myocytes infected with either Ad.Cn*, Ad.CaMK*, or Ad.GFP (control) in three independent trials. Given that both Cn* and CaMK* activate expression of PGC-1α, we were particularly interested in the response of known PGC-1α target genes. Genes considered to be regulated exhibited either a ≥2-fold increase or ≥50% decrease in expression relative to GFP-infected controls. In addition, genes that were increased from being undetectable (absent) to detectable (present or “P”) or decreased from being present to absent (“A”) were considered to be regulated. Among the 8800 genes on the array, Cn* activated 213 (2.4%) genes and repressed 56 (0.6%) genes. CaMK* activated 290 (3.3%) genes and repressed 88 (1.0%) genes. A significant number of the regulated genes were involved in energy metabolic or regulatory pathways downstream of PGC-1α (Table I). Regulated genes sorted into several clusters, including transcriptional regulation and signaling, cellular fatty acid utilization, mitochondrial metabolism, and glucose metabolism (Table I). Notably, genes involved in nearly every stage of mitochondrial energy transduction were induced by both Cn* and CaMK*, many of which are known targets of PGC-1α. Strikingly, very few genes from this broad cellular energy metabolic program were down-regulated (Table I).Table IResults of transcriptional profiling using DNA microarrays of cardiac myocyte genes following overexpression of Ca* or CaMK* Open table in a new tab Important differences in the effects of Cn* and CaMK* overexpression in cardiac myocytes were noted. In particular, expression of the gene encoding the nuclear receptor PPARα, a known partner of PGC-1α in the activation of genes involved in cellular fatty acid (FA) uptake and oxidation, was strongly induced by Cn*, but not CaMK* (Table IA). In addition to PPARα, several other transcriptional regulators and signaling molecules were activated by Cn* and CaMK* in a nearly mutually exclusive pattern (Table IA). Consistent with the observed induction of PPARα gene expression by Cn*, we found that a significant number of PPARα targets were induced by this signaling pathway. Specifically, Cn* activated the expression of known PPARα target genes involved in fatty acid uptake (e.g. CD36), mitochondrial β-oxidation (e.g. M-CPT I and II, VLCAD, LCAD, and MCAD), and peroxisomal β-oxidation (acyl-CoA oxidase) (Table IB). Similarly, Cn* increased expression of genes encoding lipoprotein lipase, mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase 1, and several other genes involved in cellular fatty acid metabolism (Table IB). In contrast, CaMK* activated only a small subset of PPARα targets involved in fatty acid uptake (e.g. CD36) and oxidation (e.g. M-CPT I and MCAD). These results suggested that the activation of the PPARα gene by Cn* but not CaMK* mediates the selective regulation of genes involved in cellular FA uptake and oxidation. The profile of metabolic genes activated by CaMK* exhibited an overlapping but distinct pattern compared with that of Cn*. CaMK* activated two major categories of metabolic genes. First, CaMK* activated a broad range of genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes, including enzymes involved in the trichloroacetic acid cycle (e.g. isocitrate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase), electron transport (e.g. cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase subunits), and oxidative phosphorylation (ATP synthase subunits), many of which are known PGC-1α targets. In addition, CaMK* activated expression of the genes encoding muscle and brain isoforms of creatine kinase. Cn* activated only a subset of these mitochondrial energy metabolic genes (Table IC). Second, CaMK* activated genes involved in cellular glucose uptake and utilization, including glucose transport (GLUT4), glycolysis (phosphofructokinase, PFK), and glucose oxidation (pyruvate dehydrogenase). In contrast, only pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) was activated by Cn* (Table ID). To validate the results of the microarray experiments, realtime PCR was used to determine mRNA expression levels of PPARα and one of its known targets, M-CPT I, following infection with Ad.Cn* or Ad.CaMK* in cardiac myocytes and C2C12 myotubes. Consistent with the transcriptional profiling results, Cn* activated endogenous PPARα expression in both cell types, whereas CaMK* infection had no effect (Fig. 2). Expression of M-CPT I was significantly induced by both Cn* and CaMK* in cardiac myocytes similar to the results of the gene expression array experiments. Interestingly, in contrast to"

In mimicking host ligands, Hwp1 adds an example from the fungal kingdom to known microbial adhesins that imitate mammalian proteins (3Knodler L.A. Celli J. Finlay B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). With a half-mammalian-like, half-fungal hybrid primary structure, Hwp1 interacts with the cornified epithelium through the N-terminal domain, while being expressed on germ tube surfaces attached through the C-terminal domain. HWP1 is highly induced during germ tube formation and absent during yeast growth (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6298-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). HWP1 expression appears to be coordinately controlled by transcriptional activators and repressors that control morphology (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2496-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). High HWP1 mRNA levels are reflected in high protein levels on germ tube surfaces. Recent experiments employing recombinant Hwp1 (rHwp1) have documented that the mature N-terminal third of Hwp1 serves as a substrate for mammalian TGases (10Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TGase activity on surfaces of buccal epithelial cells, attributed to TGase 1 by others (11Lee C.H. Marekov L.N. Kim S. Brahim J.S. Park M.H. Steinert P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), utilizes rHwp1 as a substrate, confirming that the similarity in primary structure of rHwp1 to mammalian small proline-rich proteins extends to function. Furthermore, the requirement for Hwp1 in stabilized attachment of germ tubes to buccal epithelial cells (BECs) illustrates that Hwp1 participates in important interactions between C. albicans and the oral mucosa (10Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insights into the structure-function relationships of the C-terminal region of Hwp1 are inferred by analogy to the primary amino acid sequences of known or putative cell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans. The last 50 amino acids have features consistent with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor modification and anchorage to cell wall glucan. Elegant work on the α-agglutinin of S. cerevisiae (12Lu C.F. Kurjan J. Lipke P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a prototypical adhesin, has demonstrated that multiple processing events occur at the C terminus that result in transient positioning of the adhesin in the cytoplasmic membrane and in the periplasm before becoming covalently attached to cell wall β-glucan. However, very little information is available on how the structure of Hwp1 relates to its function. Here we delineate the similiarities of Hwp1 to small proline-rich (SPR) proteins that are likely to be responsible for the TGase substrate properties of Hwp1. SPR proteins are the major components of a specialized structure termed the cornified cell envelope of normal human buccal and gingival tissues that is essential for barrier function (11Lee C.H. Marekov L.N. Kim S. Brahim J.S. Park M.H. Steinert P.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Candi E. Tarcsa E. Idler W.W. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7226-7237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The SPRs become cross-linked to themselves and other cornified envelope proteins by both disulfide bonds and isopeptide bonds formed by transglutaminase to form an insoluble macromolecular protein complex ideal for barrier function. Although both SPR proteins and Hwp1 are TGase substrates, Hwp1 lacks the tripartite domain structure that serves to cross-link the head and tail domains of SPR proteins to themselves or to other proteins. In addition, Hwp1 also lacks Lys residues that are usually found adjacent to reactive Gln residues in TGase substrates. Very little information exists on the relatedness of C-terminal processing motifs in C. albicans and those studied in S. cerevisiae. To understand the role of Hwp1 in the pathogenesis of candidiasis in the cornified layers of the oroesophageal epithelium, information on the structure of the TGase substrate domain that permits interaction with mammalian TGase is needed. The primary amino acid sequence is predictive of glycosylation and anchorage to the β-glucan; however, the extent of glycosylation, the size of N-linked glycans, and the C-terminal attributes that lead to cell wall incorporation are unknown. Determining the distribution of TGase-modifiable Hwp1 among the membrane, wall, and cell-free fractions is essential for delineating the mechanism of adherence of C. albicans to mammalian cells. Few individual fungal cell wall proteins have been characterized at the molecular level. Here we have taken advantage of the TGase substrate property of the N-terminal domain of Hwp1 to selectively tag the molecule on germ tube surfaces using guinea pig liver TGase 2. Examination of subcellular germ tube fractions reveal that Hwp1 is a member of the GPI anchor-dependent family of cell wall proteins with the majority of the molecules being linked to the β-glucan as predicted. However, we also show that native Hwp1 is a complex mixture of forms that are cell-free, membrane-bound, as well as cell wall-linked and that the C terminus is required for retention of Hwp1 at the cell surface. The TGase substrate domain itself is a tight, disulfide-linked coil without discernible secondary structure. These structural attributes provide a molecular explanation for a fungal adhesin that mediates a unique microbial-host parasite interaction mechanism.

Organisms were stored at –80 °C and cultured on yeast peptone dextrose agar at room temperature according to standard methods (17Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Recombinant Hwp1—rHwp1N13 consisting of amino acids 40–187 was produced in Pichia pastoris (Invitrogen) transformed with a recombinant expression plasmid (pPICN13). The DNA region encoding rHwp1N13 amino acids was amplified by the PCR with oligonucleotides 5′-AACCCGGGGAAGCTCTTATTCAAAAGAGA and 5′-CCCGGGTTAATCTGGGATCCAATCAGTTGGAATATTTGG, engineered with SmaI sites (underlined nucleotides) and genomic DNA from the wild type strain SC5314 as template. The 3′ oligonucleotide introduced a stop codon (bold nucleotides) after the last HWP1 codon to avoid fusion of vector-encoded amino acids at the C terminus of the recombinant protein. The PCR product was digested with SmaI (Invitrogen) and ligated into the SnaBI site of the expression vector pPIC9 (Invitrogen) to generate pPICN13. rHwp1N13 was secreted by P. pastoris and purified from culture medium by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q; Bio-Rad) using a salt gradient (0–1 m NaCl) in column buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 2 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) followed by gel filtration chromatography over a 1.5 × 100-cm column packed with BioGel A fine gel (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 170 mm NaCl). Protein purity was determined by isoelectric focusing, and authenticity was verified by N-terminal sequencing (Louisiana State University Core Laboratories, New Orleans, LA). Circular Dichroic Spectra—CD spectra of rHwp1N13 were recorded using an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter and quartz cuvettes with 0.2-cm path lengths. The temperature of the cell compartment was maintained constant at 25 °C with a RC-6 Lauda circulating water bath. All of the far-UV spectra were scanned from 250 to 200 nm with a rHwp1N13 concentration of 100 μg/ml at intervals of 1 nm with a 1.5-nm slit width and a 3-s dwell time. The buffer used for far-UV spectra was 20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7. Each spectrum reflects an average of three scans. The sample spectra were corrected for the appropriate buffer blanks. The digital data for the corrected far-UV spectra were converted to mean residue ellipticity according to Equation 1, [θ]=[θ]obs/10{MRC}l(Eq. 1) where [θ] is the mean residue ellipticity in deg cm2/dmol, [θ]obs is the ellipticity recorded by the instrument in millidegrees, MRC is the mean residue concentration of the enzyme estimated as the product of the number of amino acid residues and the protein concentration in dmol/ml, and l is the path length in cm. Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence spectra were recorded on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer equipped with a water-jacketed sample compartment to maintain the temperature in the cuvette at 25 °C. The excitation and emission slit widths were 4 nm. Spectra of blanks, i.e. of samples containing all components except rHwp1N13, were taken immediately prior to measurements of samples containing protein. The blank spectra were then substracted from spectra of samples containing protein. Fluorescence spectra of rHwp1N13 (40 μg/ml) using the following buffers at 100 mm concentration for the pH ranges indicated: homopiperazine-N,N′-bis-2-(ethanesulfonic acid), 5; Mes, 6; Hepes, 7–8; Ches, 9–10; CAPS, 10.5–11; and K2HPO4, 11.5–12. All of the buffers (Sigma-Aldrich) were titrated with KOH, and the fluorescence data were acquired at room temperature (25 °C). Emission spectra from 300–500 nm were taken with the excitation monochromator fixed at 280, 260, and 298 nm. Excitation spectra from 250–310 nm were taken with the emission monochromator fixed at 330, 350, and 390 nm. Free Thiols—The presence of free thiols was investigated by measuring the absorbance at 324 nm in the presence of rHwp1N13 (11.3 μm) and 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (Aldrich) (0.4 mm) in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7. The 4,4′-dithiodipyridine solution was prepared in ethanol. All of the UV-visible spectra were collected at 25 °C in quartz cuvettes with 1-cm path lengths in a volume of 1 ml. The absorbance spectra were measured at the times indicated in Fig. 2B using a Hewlett Packard 8453A diode array spectrophotometer. The protein concentration was determined as previously published (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6298-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Modification of Hwp1 on Germ Tube Surfaces Using the TGase Reaction—Exposed Hwp1 available for acting as a substrate for exogenous TGases was modified by cross-linking the biotinylated lysine analog 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine (Pierce) to the surface of germ tubes catalyzed by guinea pig TGase 2 as described (10Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that germ tubes were induced in Lee's pH 6.8 medium at 37 °C from yeast cells grown in Lee's pH 4.5 medium at 27 °C to log phase (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6298-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The TGase reaction was terminated by adding EDTA to 10 mm and washing the germ tubes twice with sterile distilled H2O before suspending in 1.5 ml of breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) (12Lu C.F. Kurjan J. Lipke P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science)) for cell fractionation and immunoprecipitations. A portion of the germ tubes were spotted onto slides, dried, and reacted with Z-avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as before (10Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess the TGase reaction prior to disrupting the cells. Metabolic Radiolabeling of Germ Tube Proteins—The germ tubes were induced from log phase yeasts for 3 h at 37 °C in Lee's pH 6.8 medium with a low concentration of Met. The concentration of Met was reduced to 1 μg/ml to promote the uptake of Trans-35S-label metabolic labeling reagent ([35S]l-Met and [35S]l-Cys; >1000 Ci/mmol; ICN Biomedical Research Products, Cosa Mesa, CA) added at 5 μCi/ml. The average uptake of Trans-35S-label by germ tubes was between 50 and 60%. Radiolabeled germ tubes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1.5 ml of breakage buffer with protease inhibitors (see section above) for cell fractionation experiments detailed below. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Cell Walls—Germ tubes in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer were broken with 1.2 gm of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 microns; Sigma-Aldrich) in a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products) by ten 30-s bursts. The broken cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The glass beads were washed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and the wash was combined with the original supernatant. The crude cell extracts were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The supernatants (cell extracts/soluble fractions) were centrifuged a second time at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C before use in immunoprecipitations. The pelleted cell walls from the initial 15,000 × g spin were washed in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors as above. The washed walls were boiled twice for 5 min in 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors at 40 μg/ml, and 0.1 mm Pefabloc) to remove the noncovalently bound wall proteins. Quantazyme Treatment of Cell Walls—The SDS-boiled cell walls from 3–4 × 108 organisms were washed twice in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors, and suspended in 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors, and 75 units of Quantazyme ylg (Quantum Biotechnologies, InterSpex Products, Inc., Foster City, CA). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with rocking. The residual undigested cell walls were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants containing the cell wall material were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C before being transferred to new tubes for immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitations, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—The cell extract and Quantazyme-released wall proteins received 20 μl of polyclonal rabbit serum raised to recombinant Hwp1 (rHwp1, coded by the partial cDNA (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6298-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) or to rHwp1N13 (rabbit serum was generated as described for rHwp1 (4Staab J.F. Ferrer C.A. Sundstrom P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6298-6305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) adsorbed to SC5314 whole yeast cells and to SC5314 yeast acetone powder (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 663Google Scholar). After the samples were incubated on ice overnight, 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline was added, and incubation on ice continued for another 0.5–1 h. The Sepharose beads were washed as before (19Sundstrom P.M. Kenny G.E. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 609-614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in 25 μl of sample buffer (Invitrogen/Novex Tris-Acetate PAGE system), heated to 70 °C for 10 min, spun, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The samples (5–10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) using 3–8% Tris acetate gels as per the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). MultiMark protein standards (Invitrogen) served as molecular size markers. Following SDS-PAGE, the TGase 2-modified proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membranes, and Hwp1–5-(biotinamido)pentylamine was detected by incubating the membranes with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) followed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates from radiolabeled germ tubes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as above followed by fluorography (21Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The dried gels were exposed to x-ray film for several days at –80 °C. Endoglycosidase H Treatment of Hwp1 Species—Immunoprecipitated 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine-cross-linked Hwp1 proteins were treated with Endo H (Roche Applied Science) as follows: after the last wash of the Protein A-Sepharose, the Sepharose beads were boiled in 30 μl of Endo H buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% SDS) for 3 min to denature and release the immunoprecipitated Hwp1 from the protein A-Sepharose followed by centrifugation for 30 s at 15,000 × g. The supernatants were split into two 15-μl portions. One sample received 5 milliunits (5 μl) of Endo H, and the other received additional Endo H buffer. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight (18 h) and terminated by addition of sample buffer to 1× and heating for 10 min at 70 °C. Portions of the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting as above. Aqueous HF Treatment of Hwp1—Quantazyme-released 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine-cross-linked Hwp1 was treated with ice-cold aqueous HF (48%; Aldrich) for 18 h as described (22Kapteyn J.C. Montijn R.C. Vink E. de la Cruz J. Llobell A. Douwes J.E. Shimoi H. Lipke P.N. Klis F.M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After the HF was evaporated, the proteins were washed three times with 90% cold methanol and dried. The samples were suspended in 30 μl of Endo H buffer, heated, and split into two portions. Following overnight (18 h) incubation at 37 °C with or without 5 milliunits of Endo H, the samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. Hwp1–5-(biotinamido)pentylamine species were detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence. In some experiments, isolated cell walls (boiled in SDS lysis buffer) from SC5314 were treated with aqueous HF for 18 h as above. The methanol-washed dried walls were taken up in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 663Google Scholar) and heated to 70 °C for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged (15,000 × g) for 5 min, and Hwp1was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with anti-rHwp1 antiserum as above. The HF-released Hwp1 was also examined directly by adding 1× sample buffer to the methanol-washed, dried cell walls, heating to 70 °C for 10 min and analyzing samples of the supernatants by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Expression of a Truncated Form of Hwp1 in C. albicans—The C-terminal 26 amino acids of Hwp1 were removed by the introduction of a stop codon one amino acid upstream from the predicted GPI anchor addition site (Gly613 (23Staab J.F. Sundstrom P. Yeast. 1998; 14: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (GeneEditor; Promega) was used to insert a single bp (T/A) after bp 1825 (from the ATG) in HWP1 to shift the reading frame 1+ to a stop codon three amino acids post-bp insertion. This created a truncated Hwp1 missing the predicted GPI anchor addition amino acid motifs and having three non-Hwp1 residues at its C terminus (underlined): Ile608-Phe-Tyr-Ile. The mutagenized and a wild type HWP1 ORF were amplified by PCR and cloned downstream of the HWP1 promoter in pHWP1GFP3 (24Staab J.F. Bahn Y.S. Sundstrom P. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a reporter plasmid constructed to analyze HWP1 promoter activity. The plasmid constructs containing wild type (pHwp1WT) and truncated (pHwp1T) HWP1 ORFs were linearized at the unique ClaI site and used to transform the Ura–hwp1 null strain CAH7–1A1 (25Sundstrom P. Cutler J.E. Staab J.F. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3281-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proper integrations of the plasmids at the chromosomal ENO1 locus were verified by Southern blot analysis. Stationary phase yeasts grown in yeast nitrogen base of two independent transformants from each construct were induced to form germ tubes in M199 at 37 °C for 3 h as described previously (26Sundstrom P. Aliaga G.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The germ tubes were tested for surface Hwp1 by immunofluorescence assays (23Staab J.F. Sundstrom P. Yeast. 1998; 14: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Sundstrom P. Aliaga G.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 452-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with rHwp1N13 antiserum used in immunoprecipitations described above. The germ tube culture media were filtered to remove any remaining cells, and the total protein in a portion of the culture media precipitated in cold 50% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h. The protein pellets were washed with acetone, dried, suspended in 1× sample buffer, heated to 70 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Hwp1 was detected by anti-rHwp1N13 antiserum followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Hwp1 was visualized with chemiluminescence as above. Phosphatidylinositol-dependent Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Digestion of Cell Walls—Unboiled cell walls from 1.5–2 × 108 organisms were washed once in 25 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and once with 10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA (PI-PLC buffer) with protease inhibitors, and suspended 200 μl of PI-PLC buffer. One-half of the cell wall suspension was treated with 0.1 U of PI-PLC (Sigma) and the other half was mock-treated. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove the cell walls. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes. The pelleted cell walls were boiled twice in SDS lysis buffer as above, and the supernatants moved to new tubes. The PI-PLC and SDS lysis buffer-released proteins from the cell walls were diluted 1:3 and 1:4, respectively, in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 663Google Scholar) before adding 20 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-rHwp1N13 serum. The samples were processed as for immunoprecipitations, analyzed for Hwp1–5-(biotinamido)pentylamine species by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Adhesion Assays—The ability of rHwp1N13 to compete or inhibit stabilized adhesion of germ tubes to BECs was determined by preincubating rHwp1N13 at a concentration of 2 μm or salivary amylase at 4 μm (negative control, a gift from Dr. Frank Oppenheim at Boston University) with 1 × 105 BECs for 15 min at 37 °C in adhesion reaction buffer prior to the addition of 1 × 107 metabolically radiolabeled ([35S]l-Met) germ tubes for 1 h at 37 °C as described for stabilized adhesion assays (10Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P. Science. 1999; 283: 1535-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesion of germ tubes to BECs in the presence of rHwp1N13 or salivary amylase was set relative to assays in the absence of added proteins. The assays were performed at least twice in"

They have been described to play a role in multiple prototypical cascades, among them the lipopolysaccharide pathway, and to host multiple signaling proteins, including kinases and low molecular weight G-proteins. Here we report lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, and we show its activation in the human neutrophil to be mediated by a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism. Subcellular fractionation reveals that lipopolysaccharide induces translocation of Cdc42 to lipid rafts, where it and p38 are both found to be activated. By contrast, lipopolysaccharide causes translocation of Rac from the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) rafts and does not induce its activation. With the use of methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-depleting agent that reversibly disrupts rafts, we confirm an important regulatory role for rafts in the activation state of p38 and Cdc42 and in the Rho GTPase-dependent functions superoxide anion production and actin polymerization. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin induces activation of p38 and Cdc42, but not Rac, in the nonstimulated PMN, yet inhibits subsequent lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of p38 and Cdc42. In parallel, methyl-β-cyclodextrin primes the human PMN for subsequent superoxide release triggered by the formylated bacterial tripeptide formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, and induces actin polymerization in a subcellular distribution distinct from that induced by lipopolysaccharide. In sum, these findings provide evidence for an important regulatory role of cholesterol in both transmission of the lipopolysaccharide signal and the inflammatory phenotype of the human neutrophil.

In sum, these findings provide evidence for an important regulatory role of cholesterol in both transmission of the lipopolysaccharide signal and the inflammatory phenotype of the human neutrophil. Lipid rafts are cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains that are thought to function as coordinated signaling platforms in cells through their regulation of dynamic, agonist-induced translocation of specific signaling proteins (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). A variety of signaling components, including receptors (e.g. epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and endothelin receptors), kinases (e.g. Lyn, Syk, and protein kinase C), phosphatases (e.g. Syp), and both heterotrimeric and low molecular weight G-proteins (e.g. Rac, Cdc42, and Rho) have been localized to rafts (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Raft compartmentalization is thought to play an important role in regulating the activation state of, and dynamic interactions among, proteins. A centrally important implication of localization of signaling events to lipid rafts is that such molecular interactions, like the physicochemical organization of rafts themselves, are sensitive to alteration of cellular cholesterol content. By exploiting this property of rafts, multiple investigators (3Chen X. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34617-34623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Furuchi T.

The mechanism of cyclodextrin-induced effects upon the cell can be confirmed as cholesterol depletion either by co-incubating cells with cyclodextrin and cholesterol (thereby preventing depletion) or by using the cyclodextrin-cholesterol complex as a vehicle to sequentially cholesterol-replete cells that have been depleted by cyclodextrin. Repletion is thought to restore raft structure and function (5Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Although the best established role for rafts as signaling platforms may have been demonstrated in T and B cell receptor activation (6Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin.

This discovery (made possible by the ability to isolate lipid rafts by exploiting their properties of Triton insolubility and relative buoyant density) has ignited interest in using rafts as a window to discover novel signaling interactions in LPS signaling (8Triantafilou M.

In this light, Rho family GTPases (i.e. Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) have recently been independently reported to be localized to rafts in ECV304 cells (11Gingras D. Gauthier F. Lamy S. Desrosiers R.R.

To our knowledge there have been no reports describing LPS-induced activation of Rho GTPases in a human primary immune cell nor in confirming a clear role for lipid rafts in the regulation of these proteins. The Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 have been shown in the neutrophil (PMN) to regulate innate immune response functions, including superoxide anion ( O2−˙) generation, actin polymerization, and chemotaxis (16Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Yang C. Brown K. Huang M. Pring M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Dinauer M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought in the present study to investigate whether LPS activates Rac and/or Cdc42 in the human PMN and, in parallel, to discern whether rafts exert any regulatory influence upon their activation or upon Rho GTPase-dependent functions. Here we report that LPS activates Cdc42 via a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent mechanism and induces recruitment of Cdc42 into rafts, where it and p38 are both found to be activated. Furthermore, we demonstrate a clear role for lipid rafts in regulation of the activation state of p38 and Cdc42 and in regulation of Rho GTPase-dependent functions, specifically O2−˙ generation and actin polymerization. These findings shed new light upon the basic mechanisms underlying the innate immune response, and raise new and interesting questions about the role of cholesterol in regulating the inflammatory phenotype of the human PMN. Reagents—Endotoxin-free reagents and plastics were used in all experiments. PMNs were isolated from whole blood by discontinuous plasma Percoll centrifugation (18Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K.

Mouse anti-flotillin-1 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Neutrophil Treatment—Human PMNs were resuspended at a concentration of 20 × 106/ml, preincubated with 10 μm SB203580 or 0.1% Me2SO carrier (60 min, 37 °C), and then treated with 100 ng/ml E. coli 0111:B4 LPS (List Biological Laboratories, Inc.) under continuous rotation at 37 °C for varying durations ranging from 2 to 40 min. Cdc42 and Rac Activation Assays—Cdc42 and Rac activation levels in LPS-treated PMNs were assayed as described (19Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Briefly, stimulated cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold 1× MLB buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4 and clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). 5 μg of PBD-GST-agarose was then added to the supernatants, and they were incubated with continuous rotation (60 min, 4 °C). Prior to incubation with PBD-GST, non-LPS-exposed negative and positive control supernatants were incubated with 1 mm GDP and 100 μm GTPγS, respectively (15 min, 30 °C), in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, after which they were immediately placed on ice and treated with 60 mm MgCl2. PBD-GST-agarose affinity precipitates were washed three times with 1× MLB buffer, eluted in 2× Laemmli reducing buffer (5 min, 100 °C), electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with anti-Rac and anti-Cdc42 antibodies. In some experiments, sucrose density gradient fractions of PMN lysates (described further below) were similarly assayed for active Cdc42. Lipid Raft Isolation—PMNs (400 × 106) were resuspended at a concentration of 20 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6) and 1% human heat-inactivated platelet-poor plasma, and either left untreated or stimulated as described. Following stimulation, rafts were isolated by using a modification of the method of Cheng et al. (20Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged (15,000 rpm, 20 s) and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm AEBSF, 1 mm NaF; 1 mm Na3VO4;5 μg/ml leupeptin; 5 μg/ml aprotinin). PMNs were then sonicated for 60 s on ice. High density insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (950 μl) was added to 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl), gently mixed by vortexing, and then centrifuged through a 10-40% continuous sucrose gradient using an SW41 rotor (20 h, 37,000 rpm, 4 °C). Following centrifugation, 10 1-ml fractions were harvested from the bottom by puncturing the tube with an 18-gauge needle. Protein concentrations in each fraction were determined by the Bradford Protein Assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of protein from each fraction was electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies for proteins of interest. Raft-containing fractions were identified by measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity (see below), as well as by immunoblotting for the raft-specific protein flotillin-1 (22Bickel P.E.

Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—Sucrose density gradient fractions were measured for enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase (a raft-specific, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein (24Brown D.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar)) to identify rafts (26Cottin V. Doan J.E. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of each fraction was added to separate wells of a 96-well flat-bottom plate and then mixed with 200 μl of reaction buffer (5 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate in 100 mm 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, pH 10.0). Reaction mixtures were incubated (15 min, 37 °C), and the absorbance was then read in a microplate reader at 405 nm. Cellular Cholesterol Depletion and Repletion—PMNs were cholesterol-depleted with mβCD using a modification of Ilangumaran and Hoessli (27Ilangumaran S. Hoessli D.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended at 5 × 106/ml in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer supplemented with 0.2% dextrose and 0.25% delipidated bovine serum albumin, incubated with 5 mm mβCD (15 min, 37 °C), washed, and then resuspended. In order to demonstrate the raft specificity of mβCD, cholesterol repletion of depleted cells (hereafter, “sequential repletion”) was performed by incubation with mβCD-100 μm cholesterol complex (see below) (15 min, 37 °C), followed by washing and resuspension. As a control for cholesterol repletion, depleted cells were incubated with mβCD-100 μm pregnenolone, a complex ineffective in cholesterol delivery. As an alternative control to sequential cholesterol depletion and repletion, untreated cells were treated with a concentration of cholesterol (10 μm) complexed to mβCD that was confirmed to maintain cellular cholesterol levels constant (hereafter, “iso-repletion,” see under “Results”). 10 mm stock solutions of mβCD-cholesterol and mβCD-pregnenolone complexes were formed by dissolving 30 mg of cholesterol or 24.7 mg of pregnenolone, respectively, in 400 μl of 2:1 methanol/chloroform, and then dissolving these dropwise in 11 ml of 69.4 mm mβCD in PBS preheated to 80 °C. This solution was freeze-dried overnight, and working stock solutions were made in water. Cellular Cholesterol and Phospholipid Quantitation—A mass spectroscopic method was developed for cellular cholesterol quantitation. To determine cholesterol content, 2 parts of MeOH was added to samples (1 ml). An aliquot of this sample (10%) was taken for analysis, and stable isotope-labeled d6-cholesterol (50 ng, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) was then added to this aliquot. After mixing, samples were extracted with 1 ml of iso-octane. A portion of the extract was dried under a stream of N2, and trimethylsilyl derivatives were prepared by adding 50 μl each of bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and acetonitrile. The vials were then capped and heated at 60 °C for 15 min. Analysis of the samples was performed by a Finnigan Trace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry system (Thermo Finnigan, Thousand Oaks, CA), using a 15-m ZB-l column from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA), by injecting 1% of the extract. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode. Data were acquired by selected ion monitoring, where m/z 368 was monitored for cholesterol and m/z 374 was monitored for the trimethylsilyl ether derivative of d6-cholesterol. Peak areas of each analyte were measured, and the ratio of the area of the cholesterol-derived ion to that from the internal standard was calculated. In separate experiments, 50 ng of the same internal standard solution of d6-cholesterol was added to known amounts of cholesterol in solution (reference standards) ranging from 640 pg to 2 μg. The cholesterol was then extracted, derivatized, and analyzed as described above. When the 640-pg reference standard was analyzed (corresponding to 6.4 pg injected on-column) a signal-to-noise for m/z 368 was found to be 38. After the ratio of m/z 368 to m/z 374 was plotted against the amount of the reference standard divided by the amount of internal standard (50 ng), the resulting curve was found to be linear (y = 0.9114 + 0.0654) with a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.999. This curve was used to calculate the amount of cholesterol in each sample which ranged between 500 and 1400 ng/sample, all within the range of this standard curve. To quantitate total phospholipid content, lipids were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The concentration of total phosphate within the extracted fractions was then determined as a surrogate measure of phospholipid concentration (29Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Biochem. Z. 1963; 337: 477-479PubMed Google Scholar). Assay of Superoxide Anion Release—Release of superoxide anion was determined in triplicate experiments using methods described previously (30Guthrie L.A. McPhail L.C. Henson P.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1656-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Assay of Actin Polymerization by Flow Cytometry—Actin assembly was determined in triplicate by NBD-phallacidin staining, as described previously (31Erzurum S.C. Downey G.P. Doherty D.E. Schwab III, B. Elson E.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 154-162PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—PMNs were stimulated and then stained as described previously (32Maddox P.H. Jenkins D. J. Clin. Pathol. 1987; 40: 1256-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose/PBS (30 min, 37 °C), settled on coverslips, permeabilized with 0.02% Tween 20/PBS (5 min, room temperature), washed once with 1× PBS, and then stained with 5 units of rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Photographs were taken using an Olympus Vanox Microscope with 60× oil objective using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging, Denver, CO). LPS Activates Cdc42 by a p38-dependent Mechanism— Whereas an important role for Rho GTPases in such prototypical inflammatory responses of the PMN as O2−˙ generation and actin polymerization has been demonstrated previously (16Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Yang C. Brown K. Huang M. Pring M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1001-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Dinauer M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, there have been no reports of activation of Rho GTPases by LPS in the human PMN. Given that LPS activates only the p38 MAPK arm of the MAPK superfamily in the human PMN in suspension (33Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Lehman L.A. McDonald P.P. Frasch S.C. Billstrom M.A. Henson P.M. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and that p38 plays an important role in O2−˙ generation (18Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Young S.K. Knall C. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), we further queried whether p38 may lie upstream of Cdc42. In order to test these hypotheses, affinity precipitation was performed upon lysates of LPS-exposed PMNs using a recombinant PBD-GST fusion protein (19Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), which recognizes only the active, GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and Rac. Immunoblotting of the affinity precipitates indicates that LPS induces a time-dependent increase in the abundance of GTP-bound Cdc42 first detected after 5 min (Fig. 1A) and observed for 40 min (data not shown). LPS-induced activation of Cdc42 is inhibited by preincubation with the p38 inhibitor SB203580. No consistent effect upon LPS-induced Cdc42 activation was noted with piceatannol, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nor wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (data not shown). Because Cdc42 activation by TLR2 agonists such as S. aureus has been reported previously in THP-1 cells (15Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and concern has been expressed over the possibility of TLR2 agonists contaminating commercial LPS preparations (34Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), we tested whether peptidoglycan, a TLR2 agonist, would activate Cdc42 in the human PMN. Similar to S. aureus in THP-1 cells (15Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref Scopus (555) Google Scholar), peptidoglycan induced a rapid and transient activation of Cdc42 in the human PMN, with activation noted at 1-2 min and a return to base line before 5 min (data not shown). The much more delayed and prolonged time course of Cdc42 activation noted with LPS (Fig. 1) indicates that TLR2 agonist contaminants (e.g. bacterial lipoproteins) are very unlikely to explain the phenomena noted with LPS in this study. LPS does not induce activation of Rac in the human PMN (Fig. 1A). Whereas no Rac activation was noted with LPS exposures ranging between 1 and 30 min (data not shown), rapid and transient Rac activation was observed after fMLP treatment (Fig. 1B). Of note, Rac activation in the human PMN has been reported previously not only with fMLP but also with platelet-activating factor, phorbol myristate acetate, and leukotriene B4 (35Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Geijsen N. van Delft S. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Collard J.G. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS Induces Recruitment of Active Cdc42 to, and Exclusion of Rac from, Lipid Rafts—To test the possibility that LPS activates Cdc42 in human PMN rafts, PMNs were left untreated or exposed to LPS for 15 min. Following this, the cells were lysed, and 10 contiguous sucrose density gradient fractions were collected. Equal protein loads from all fractions were assayed for GTP-Cdc42 by incubation with PBD-GST-agarose, followed by elution, SDS-PAGE, transfer to nitrocellulose, and probing with anti-Cdc42. All fractions were also probed for total Cdc42 and were assayed for the presence of rafts by measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity and by immunoblotting with anti-flotillin-1 antibody. Of interest, despite the fact that the vast majority of cellular Cdc42 is localized to non-raft fractions in both nonstimulated and LPS-treated PMNs, Cdc42 is selectively activated in raft fractions, as identified by flotillin-1 (Fig. 2A). This suggests that LPS activates a very minor, raft-localized, subfraction of total cellular Cdc42 to high specific activity. The small degree of Cdc42 activation in nonstimulated cells is also localized to rafts (Fig. 2A). LPS alters neither the profile of alkaline phosphatase activity nor flotillin-1 abundance among sucrose density fractions (Fig. 2A). To confirm that LPS induces dynamic recruitment of total Cdc42 to lipid rafts, as has been demonstrated previously (37Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 556-563Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar) for other signaling proteins, the lipid raft microdomain (collected from fractions 8 and 9, corresponding to Fig. 2A) was isolated from human PMNs exposed to LPS for varying durations ranging from 2 to 20 min. A 10-fold higher protein load (10 μg) than that immunoblotted from each fraction in Fig. 2A was immunoblotted for Cdc42 and for other selected signaling proteins (Fig. 2B). As shown, LPS induces recruitment of Cdc42 to rafts, with a modest increase first detectable at 5 min. By contrast, Rac clearly diminishes in abundance in rafts after 10 min of LPS exposure. The cytoskeletal linker protein, moesin, reported previously to activate Cdc42 and other Rho GTPases by promoting their release from the Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (38Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), is located within nonstimulated PMN lipid rafts and appears modestly to increase in rafts after L"

Here, we investigated the role of electroneutral KCl cotransport (KCC), in IGF-1-dependent invasiveness and proliferation of cervical and ovarian cancer cells. IGF-1 increased KCC activity and mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in parallel with the enhancement of regulatory volume decrease.

Lancet. 2004; 363: 1346-1353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which growth factor regulates plasmalemmal ion transport promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness are little understood. This study tests the hypothesis that IGF-1 may promote cancer development and progression in part through its action on KCl cotransporter. The findings demonstrate that IGF-1 increases KCC expression and activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. KCC activity is necessary for tumor invasiveness and proliferation in vitro, and both KCC and IGF-1 expression levels correlate with tumor size in human clinical specimens. Cell Cultures and Creation of KCC Mutant Cell Lines—The human cervical cancer cell line SiHa and the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The removal of 117 amino acids from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of mouse KCC1 (KCC1 ΔN117) confers a dominant-negative phenotype when co-expressed with wild-type KCC1, KCC3, or KCC4 polypeptides (9Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Hsu Y.M. Chiu W.T. Tang M.J. Alper S.L. Ellory J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39941-39950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Casula S.

The dominant-negative mouse KCC1 ΔN117 cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), transfected into SiHa and OVCAR-3 cell lines by lipofection, and stable lines were selected as described previously (9Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Hsu Y.M. Chiu W.T. Tang M.J. Alper S.L. Ellory J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39941-39950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Functional K+(86Rb+) Efflux Assays—Unidirectional K+ efflux was carried out at 37 °C as described in detail elsewhere (7Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Liu H.S. Dunham P.B. Holtzman E.J. Ellory J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 14714-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were preincubated with isotonic culture medium loaded with 2 μCi/ml 86Rb+ for 2 h at 37 °C. After preincubation and washing, appropriate efflux medium (containing 0.1 mm ouabain and 0.01 mm bumetanide to inhibit the Na+-K+ pump and the Na+K+2Cl- cotransporter, respectively) was added to the cells. The isotonic efflux medium contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 80 mm mannitol, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH (300 ± 3 mosm). The components of the hypotonic medium are the same as those of the isotonic medium except mannitol was omitted, resulting in an osmolarity of 220 ± 3 mosm. Release of 86Rb+ from preloaded cells was measured in the efflux medium every 3 min within a 15-min duration. Cells were finally lysed with 0.5 m NaOH to release remaining intracellular 86Rb+. 86Rb+ efflux rate constants were estimated from the negative slope of the graph of ln[Xi(t)/Xi(t = 0)] versus time (t), where Xi(t = 0) denotes the total amount of 86Rb+ inside the cells at the beginning of the efflux time course and Xi(t) denotes the amount of 86Rb+ inside the cells at the time point t. To study the KCC activity, the Cl- dependence of K+ (86Rb+) efflux was examined by substituting NO3- for Cl- in the efflux medium. The Cl--dependent K+ (86Rb+) flux was defined as the efflux difference between Cl- and NO3- media. Measurements of Cell Volume—Cell volume was measured at 37 °C as described previously (9Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Hsu Y.M. Chiu W.T. Tang M.J. Alper S.L. Ellory J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39941-39950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Shen M.R. Chou C.Y.

To monitor the change of cell size, the microscope was coupled to a video camera system, and the images were recorded in real time and stored on a video cassette recorder. Images were then analyzed by Image-Pro Express (version 4.0; Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The majority of cells observed were spheroid, and the relative volume change (V/Vo) was calculated from the cross-sectional surface area at the beginning (So) of experiment and during (S) the experiments from the relation: V/Vo = (S/So)3/2 (13Shen M.R.

Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNAs were isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After annealing 5 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT), cDNA was prepared with Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotide primers regions specific for KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 cDNAs (8Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were synthesized as follows. For KCC1, forward (5′-TGGGACCATTTTCCTGACC-3′) and reverse (5′-CATGCTTCTCCACGATG TCAC-3′) primers were used to amplify a 421-bp fragment from KCC1 (hKCC1: nt 762-1182). For KCC3, forward (5′-GGAAGTAACATGGCACTTTTCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CAGGGCCATGAGCACGAGCGTG-3′) primers were used to amplify a 597-bp fragment from KCC3 (hKCC3: nt 200-796). For KCC4, forward (5′-GACTCGTTTCCGCAAAACC-3′) and reverse (5′-AGAGTGCCGTGATGCTGTTGG-3′) primers were used to amplify a 783-bp fragment from KCC4 (hKCC4: nt 2498-3280). PCR was carried out as described in detail elsewhere (8Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In brief, after heating the reaction contents for 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of PCR were performed (each consisting of incubation of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). To assess the relative changes in KCC mRNA content by IGF-1 treatment, we used semiquantitative RT-PCR with GAPDH as the internal standard. Invasion and Proliferation Assays—Cell migration was assayed in the Boyden chamber as an index of invasive activity of tumor cells (16Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml IGF-1 for 24 h before the performance of the invasion assay. Invasion assays were conducted for 12 h in serum-free culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted immediately after staining. To assess proliferation, cells were plated on 60-mm dishes, and the medium was changed every 2 days. Cell counts were performed with the aid of a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion (0.08%) to monitor viability. Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence Analysis of Cultured Cells—After serum starvation for 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with medium containing 50 ng/ml IGF-1; then, after incubation for the indicated time periods, cells were harvested with ice-cold lysis solution. Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined with the use of a Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal protein loads were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Extracts were tested for the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-related proteins and for Akt with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). All immunoblots were first probed with phosphospecific antibodies, then stripped and reprobed with antibodies against the corresponding proteins. Phosphorylated levels were analyzed by scanning densitometry and normalized to the total protein bands. The results were expressed as arbitrary units. Immunofluorescence analyses used affinity-purified antibodies against phosphorylated MAPK or against phosphorylated Akt, Alexa 488-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were viewed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Fluo-View 300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). siRNA—For siRNA knockdown of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), SiHa cells were transfected with 50 nm concentrations of either validated MAPK1 siRNA or a scrambled siRNA negative control (both from Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's instructions. The validated siRNA targets exon 4 of MAPK1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_002745), which shares 99% identity with MAPK2. Protein was extracted from the cells at 36 h, and the knockdown activity was measured by immunoblot using antibodies against Erk1/2 or β-actin. The knockdown is the relative amount of protein remaining compared with the mock-transfected group. Immunofluorescent Staining of Surgical Specimens—Tissue sections with 5 μm thickness were cut from surgical specimens of cervical cancer (n = 28) and ovarian cancer (n = 35) tissues. Sections were immunostained with monoclonal antibody against IGF-1 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and with polyclonal antibody against KCC1 C-terminal amino acids (17Roussa E. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Casula S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Thevenod F. Alper S.L. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 117: 335-344Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), followed by exposure to Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) and/or by Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich). At least five sections from each patient's specimen were analyzed for histology, IGF-1 expression, and KCC expression. Two investigators trained in gynecological pathology blindly examined each section. IGF-1 and KCC staining was evaluated manually or by image analysis with the use of a CoolSnap-Pro color digital camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) and Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics) over 15 to 20 high-power fields. The intensity and distribution of immunofluorescent stains were graded as 1, 2, 3, or 4 for each field. Statistics—All values in the present study were reported as mean ± S.E. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used for statistical analyses. Differences between values were considered significant when p < 0.05. IGF-1 Stimulated KCC Activity and Enhanced KCC-dependent Cell Volume Regulation—Because cell swelling is one of the major activating stimuli for KCC activity (1Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Ellory J.C. Gibson J.S. Stewart G.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1998; 123: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we investigated IGF-1 stimulation of swelling-activated KCC activity in 24-h serum-deprived cervical cancer SiHa cells. Fig. 1A shows that 50 ng/ml IGF-1 increased swelling-activated K+ (86Rb+) efflux in a time-dependent manner, when measured in Cl--containing medium. In contrast, swelling-activated K+ (86Rb+) was independent of IGF-1 stimulation when NO3- was substituted for Cl- in the efflux medium. KCC activity is taken as the Cl--dependent K+ (86Rb+) flux, defined as the difference between efflux into Cl- and NO3- media. However, in the presence of the KCC inhibitor DIOA (50 μm), the swelling-activated K+ (86Rb+) efflux was insensitive to IGF-1 stimulation whether efflux was measured in Cl-- or NO3--containing medium (Fig. 1B). Moreover, functional-blocking monoclonal antibody against the IGF-1 receptor α-subunit, but not IgG or monoclonal antibody to insulin receptor, completely inhibited the swelling-activated KCC activity enhanced by IGF-1 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that IGF-1 stimulates the swelling-activated KCC mediated K+ efflux via IGF-1 receptor signaling. Our previous studies suggested that the swelling-activated KCC works in concert with ion channels to mediate regulatory volume decrease of cervical cancer cells (8Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Hsu Y.M. Chiu W.T. Tang M.J. Alper S.L. Ellory J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39941-39950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Prompted by the observation of substantially increased swelling-activated KCC by IGF-1, we tested the hypothesis that IGF-1 might similarly enhance cell volume regulation. As depicted in Fig. 1D, the typical volume changes induced by hypotonic stress in serum-deprived SiHa cells (Control) exhibited three phases: 1) a rapid, initial osmotic swelling, reaching a peak cell volume (1.35 ± 0.08 of original cell size) at 3 min after exposure to hypotonic shock; 2) a rapid shrinkage in the 5 min thereafter; and 3) a more gradual cell volume decrease that within 10 min reached a value 18% above the original cell size. The rate and extent of regulatory volume decrease was significantly enhanced by IGF-1 treatment as a function of time (Fig. 1D), consistent with the time course of IGF-1 stimulation of KCC activity. IGF-1 Increased KCC mRNA Levels in a Concentration- and Time-dependent Manner—IGF-1 might increase KCC activity either by direct stimulation of signaling pathways underlying activation of KCC activity, or by regulation of KCC gene expression or RNA stability. The relatively slow time course of KCC activation by IGF-1 (Fig. 1A) suggests regulation of gene expression or RNA stability as more likely mechanisms. Fig. 2 shows by semiquantitative RT-PCR that IGF-1 stimulated mRNA levels of KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. After 6-h treatment exposure to 10 ng/ml IGF-1, KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 mRNA levels increased 20, 35, and 10%, respectively, above control levels (Fig. 2, A and B). These values increased to 45, 130, and 35% after 6-h exposure to 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (Fig. 2). Thus, increased KCC mRNA levels accompanied IGF-1-stimulated KCC activity. Molecular Mechanisms by Which IGF-1 Regulated KCC Expression—IGF-1 elicits its actions on cells by binding to the IGF-1 receptor and activating its intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase activity (18Clemmons D.R. Maile L.A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The activated IGF-1 receptor phosphorylates docking proteins, which in turn activate downstream signaling proteins leading to diverse biological responses. PI3K and MAPK are two key enzymes that are activated by IGF-1; each represents a distinct signaling pathway that mediates the biological functions of IGF-1 (19Kim B. van Golen C.M. Feldman E.L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the roles of PI3K and MAPK pathways in KCC production in response to IGF-1 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, IGF-1 treatment resulted in the strong activation of Erk1/2 and increased the nuclear localization of phosphorylated Erk1/2. PD98059 (50 μm) abolished Erk1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by IGF-1 stimulation. In contrast, the phosphorylation status of other MAPKs, such as p38 and JNK, was insensitive to IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 3C). IGF-1 treatment also resulted in Akt phosphorylation and increased the nuclear localization of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 4). Two structurally distinct inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 and wortmannin) significantly decreased IGF-1 stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.Fig. 4A, IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) stimulates Akt phosphorylation, which is abolished by LY294002 (20 μm) or wortmannin (50 nm). The immunoblot is a representative of three similar experiments. B, immunofluorescent stainings show that IGF-1 treatment results in the strong activation of Akt and increases the nuclear localization of phosphorylated Akt, which is abolished by 20 μm LY294002. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further experiments addressed the possible contribution of the Erk1/2 and PI3K pathways to IGF-1 stimulation of KCC levels. Treatment with either PD98059 or LY294002 differentially decreased KCC mRNA levels in response to stimulation by 50 ng/ml IGF-1 (Fig. 5). For example, abolition of IGF-1-induced Akt phosphorylation by 20 μm LY294002 was accompanied by 15, 10, and 50% inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated mRNA levels of KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 (Fig. 5A). Abolition of IGF-1-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation by 50 μm PD98059 was also inhibited IGF-1-stimulated KCC1 and KCC4 levels by 85 and 50%, respectively. PD98059 further inhibited the basal level of KCC3 mRNA production (Fig. 5A). Immunoblots confirmed that IGF-1 increased KCC polypeptide levels and that PD98059 and LY294002 decreased IGF-1 stimulation of KCC polypeptide level to different extents (Fig. 5B). To test more definitively the crucial importance of Erk1/2 signaling pathways for IGF-1 stimulation of KCC levels, we used siRNA to knock down Erk1/2 protein levels in SiHa cervical cancer cells. Endogenous Erk1/2 protein levels were specifically reduced in the presence of a MAPK1-specific double-stranded RNA oligomer (Fig. 6A). As a control, we used an siRNA containing a two-nucleotide mutation in the MAPK1 sequence. This control siRNA did not alter Erk1/2 protein levels (Fig. 6A). In addition, reduction of Erk1/2 protein levels with siRNA modestly reduced basal swelling-activated KCC activity and almost abolished IGF-1 stimulation of swelling-activated KCC activity (Fig. 6B). KCC Is Necessary for IGF-1-stimulated Cellular Invasion and Proliferation—The invasion assays were performed in cervical cancer SiHa cells pretreated for 24 h with 50 ng/ml IGF-1 or with serum starvation. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, IGF-1 increased the invasive migration of SiHa cells (1.8 ± 0.3-fold increase compared with absence of IGF-1), with fibronectin as chemoattractor in the lower Boyden chamber. Endogenous invasiveness was much attenuated in the KCC dominant-negative mutant cervical cancer cells (ΔN117), and their residual migration was insensitive to IGF-1 stimulation. Furthermore, whereas SiHa cervical cancer cell growth was stimulated by IGF-1 in a concentration-dependent manner, the growth of KCC dominant-negative mutant cervical cancer cells (ΔN117) was IGF-1 insensitive. The KCC inhibitor DIOA (50 μm) inhibits basal invasive and proliferative ability (Fig. 7, B and C). Moreover, DIOA (50 μm) abolished IGF-1 stimulated cellular invasion and proliferation (Fig. 7, B and C). Expression Patterns of IGF-1 and KCC in Surgical Specimens of Cervical Carcinoma—Studies in cell culture systems have revealed that IGF-1 and KCC are important modulators of cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion. To evaluate the in vivo condition, IGF-1, KCC, and nuclear DNA were simultaneously immunostained in surgical specimens (n = 28) of cervical cancer. As shown in Fig. 8, A-C, IGF-1 and KCC colocalize in the cervical cancer tissues, suggesting likely autocrine or paracrine IGF-1 stimulation of KCC production. Moreover, importantly, expression of IGF-1 and KCC in the same surgical specimens shows linear correlation (r = 0.98) (Fig. 8D). This correlation in turn corresponds well to tumor size (Fig. 8E); i.e. tumors of larger size exhibit higher intensity IGF-1 staining and higher intensity KCC staining. It is interesting that IGF-1 and KCC proteins were nearly undetectable in normal or noncancerous cervical tissues of all surgical specimens examined (n = 28). KCC Is Stimulated by IGF-1 and Is Required for Invasiveness and Proliferation of Ovarian Cancer Cells—We also studied the effect of IGF-1 on KCC activity in ovarian cancer OVCAR-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 9A, IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) enhances swelling-activated KCC activity via IGF-1 receptor signaling. IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) increases KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 mRNA levels to plateau values over a period of 3-6 h (Fig. 9B). Pharmacologic inhibition of Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways differentially inhibit IGF-1-stimulated increase in mRNA levels of KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 (Fig. 9C). IGF-1-stimulated cellular invasiveness and proliferation are abolished by the KCC inhibitor DIOA (50 μm; Fig. 9, D and E). KCC dominant-negative mutant ovarian cancer cells (ΔN117) exhibit severely attenuated IGF-1-insensitive invasiveness and proliferation (Fig. 9, D and E). In addition, IGF-1 and KCC colocalize in ovarian cancer tissues (Fig. 9F, n = 35). The present study shows that KCC activity is necessary for IGF-1-dependent proliferation and for IGF-1-stimulated chemotaxis through Matrigel, which may reflect in situ invasion. This conclusion is supported by the following findings: 1) IGF-1 stimulated KCC-mediated K+ efflux via IGF-1 receptor signaling. 2) IGF-1 stimulated KCC activity enhances the cellular capability for volume regulation, a fundamental mechanism for maintaining structural integrity and constancy of the intracellular milieu. 3) IGF-1 stimulated cellular invasion and proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Both of these activities were almost completely blocked by the KCC inhibitor, DIOA. 4) In addition, both invasiveness and proliferation of KCC dominant-negative mutant cells were insensitive to IGF-1 stimulation. 5) Immunofluorescent staining of sections from surgical specimens revealed colocalization of IGF-1 and KCC in cervical cancer and ovarian cancer tissues, suggesting possible autocrine or paracrine IGF-1 stimulation of KCC production in vivo. A main physiological function of KCC is to regulate cell volume (1Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Ellory J.C. Gibson J.S. Stewart G.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1998; 123: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that swelling-activated regulatory volume decrease was significantly enhanced by IGF-1 treatment as a function of time, consistent with the time-dependence of KCC activity stimulated by IGF-1. Cancer cells usually have higher rates of metabolism, mitosis, and migration than those of normal cells. Growth, mitosis, and migration each can perturb cell volume homeostasis significantly (20Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). The maintenance of cell volume homeostasis is a fundamental property of mammalian cells, and most cells possess mechanisms to regulate their volume during osmotic challenge. This close linkage of cell volume regulation and cell proliferation suggests the possibility that overexpression of KCC activity may serve as a selective advantage for cancer cells. The 3-6-h time course of KCC stimulation by IGF-1 makes unlikely the possibility that IGF-1 receptor signals directly to the short-term regulatory mechanisms of KCC activation. Furthermore, IGF-1 increases KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4 mRNA levels in a similar time- and concentration-dependent manner. Thus, it is very likely that IGF-1 stimulates KCC activity via regulation of gene transcription or of mRNA stability. Immunoblot analysis revealed activation of Erk1/2 and Akt by IGF-1 stimulation. Immunofluorescent staining further demonstrated translocation of activated Erk1/2 and Akt into the cancer cell nucleus. This implies that the activated Erk1/2 and Akt pathways are probably involved in gene regulation by IGF-1. Specific inhibition of MEK suppressed Erk1/2 activation and markedly reduced stimulation of KCC by IGF-1. In contrast, blockade of Akt activation by a PI3K inhibitor modestly inhibited the stimulatory effect of IGF-1 on KCC level and activity. Therefore, Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are differentially required for IGF-1 stimulation of KCC activity and polypeptide levels. Most importantly, specific reduction of Erk1/2 protein levels with siRNA abolished IGF-1-stimulated KCC activity, indicating a crucial role for the Erk1/2 signal pathway in the IGF-1 stimulation of KCC activity and protein level. It has been reported that increased KCC activity and expression is associated with the stimulation of growth factors and cytokines. For example, platelet-derived growth factor increased KCC1 and decreased KCC3 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner in vascular smooth muscle cells (21Zhang J. Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C674-C680Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). IGF-1 also up-regulated KCC3 expression and stimulated proliferation of NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with human KCC3, whereas tumor necrosis factor-α down-regulated KCC3 expression and caused growth arrest in the same cell lines (7Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Liu H.S. Dunham P.B. Holtzman E.J. Ellory J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 14714-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The KCC3 mRNA level in endothelial cells increased after treatment with vascular endothelial cell growth factor and decreased with tumor necrosis factor-α, whereas KCC1 mRNA levels remained unchanged (4Hiki K. D'Andrea R.J. Furze J. Crawford J. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Vadas M.A. Gamble J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10661-10667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor could raise the expression of KCC2, which is responsible for the maturational conversion of neuronal GABA responses from depolarizing to inhibitory, through the control of the equilibrium Cl- potential in the central nerve system (22Aguado F. Carmona M.A. Pozas E. Aguilo A. Martinez-Guijarro F.J. Alcantara S. Borrell V. Yuste R. Ibanez C.F. Soriano E.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4683-4691Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). This study has identified an unexpected role for KCC in IGF-1-dependent cellular proliferation and invasiveness. The KCC inhibitor DIOA inhibits basal invasive and proliferative ability of cervical cancer SiHa cells. This suggests that KCC activity plays a role in the regulation of cellular invasiveness and proliferation. Moreover, cervical cancer cells expressing the KCC ΔN117 mutant exhibit a lower capacity for invasiveness and proliferation than do wild-type cervical cancer cells treated with DIOA. This indicates that KCC ΔN117 mutation may produce additional effects on cellular function. For example, we demonstrated in previous works that cervical cancer cells expressing the KCC ΔN117 mutant exhibit a lower capacity for swelling-induced volume regulation than do wild-type cervical cancer cells treated with the KCC inhibitor DIOA (9Shen M.R.

The reduced ability of volume regulation in ΔN117 mutant cells results from both the near abolition of hypotonicity-activated KCl cotransport and the associated down-regulation of volume-regulated chloride channel activity (9Shen M.R.

Further work will be required to determine whether these changes reflect KCC-associated changes in [Cl-]i, [K+]i, or other yet-to-be determined functions of KCC that are perhaps not directly related to ion transport. Such transport-independent cytoskeleton and signaling functions have been described for the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 in cultured fibroblasts (24Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Taken together, IGF-1 elicits its actions on KCC by binding to IGF-1 receptor and activating PI3K and Erk1/2 MAPK. The Erk1/2 MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways are differentially required for IGF-1 stimulation of activity and expression level of distinct KCC gene products (summarized in Fig. 10). Blockade of KCC activity or expression may provide novel strategies for the treatment of IGF-1 dependent cellular invasion and proliferation of gynecological malignancy."

Based upon the homology between human and Xenopus laevis FANCF, we carried out an extensive mutagenesis study to examine which domains are functionally important and to gain more insight into the function of FANCF. In contrast to previous suggestions, we show that FANCF does not have a ROM-like function. We found that the C terminus of FANCF interacts directly with FANCG and allows the assembly of other FA proteins into a stable complex. The N terminus appears to stabilize the interaction with FANCA and FANCG and is essential for the binding of the FANCC/FANCE subcomplex. We identified several important amino acids in this N-terminal region but, surprisingly, many amino acid changes failed to affect the function of the FANCF protein. Our data demonstrate that FANCF acts as a flexible adaptor protein that plays a key role in the proper assembly of the FA core complex.

Nevertheless, it is still unknown how monoubiquitinated FANCD2 is involved in DNA repair and MMC resistance. Recently, biallelic mutations in BRCA2 have been found in cell lines derived from FA-D1 patients, adding BRCA2 to the list of FA proteins (8Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. de Die-Smulders C. Persky N. Grompe M. Joenje H. Pals G Ikada H Fox E.A. D'Andrea A.D. Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The BRCA proteins are known to be involved in a multitude of biological functions including DNA repair, recombination, cell cycle control, and transcription (21Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). BRCA2 appears to be directly linked to the repair of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (22Yang H. Jeffrey P.D. Miller J. Kinnucan E. Sun Y. Thoma N.H. Zheng N. Chen P.L.

FANCD2 has also been identified as a target of the ataxia telangiectasia (AT) signaling pathway (23Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Andreassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Kim S.T. Lane W.S. Kastan M.B.

Taken together, these data suggest that the FA proteins serve to maintain genomic stability and integrity, in concert with other protein complexes. FANCF plays an important role in the FA pathway and its functional disruption seems to be involved in specific types of cancer, as suggested from the hypermethylation of the FANCF promoter in a subset of ovarian, oral, lung, and cervical cancers (27Taniguchi T.

Genet. 2002; 11: 3125-3134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but for FANCF this information is lacking, since none of the FA-F patients have missense mutations that could provide insight into its function (5de Winter J.P. Rooimans M.A. van der Weel L. van Berkel C.G. Alon N. Bosnoyan-Collins L. de Groot J. Zhi Y. Waisfisz Q. Pronk J.C. Arwert F. Mathew C.G. Scheper R.K. Hoatlin M.E. Buchwald M. Joenje H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For this reason, we started a site-directed mutagenesis study to obtain more information about functional domains in the FANCF protein. Because such domains are expected to be relatively conserved during evolution, we searched for FANCF homologs in lower vertebrates that might highlight important residues in FANCF. We found a X. laevis homolog of FANCF (xFANCF), which has a relatively low overall homology with human FANCF. However, two relatively conserved regions were located at the N and C terminus. Based upon this conservation we generated a large panel of FANCF mutants and identified several functionally important amino acids and domains in FANCF. This study reveals that FANCF is an adaptor protein that plays a key role in the proper assembly of the FA core complex. To be able to perform this function the N terminus of FANCF interacts with the FANCC/FANCE subcomplex, whereas the C terminus binds to the FANCA/FANCG subcomplex. Cell Culture and Transfection—Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Selection medium to obtain stable cell lines also contained hygromycin B (100 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science). For stable expression lymphoblastoid cell lines were transfected by electroporation using an ECM830 electrosquareporator (BTX, San Diego, CA). The MMC-induced growth inhibition assays were performed as previously described (35Ishida R. Buchwald M. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 4000-4006PubMed Google Scholar, 36Joenje H. Lo Ten Foe J.R. Oostra A.B. van Berkel C.G. Rooimans M.A. Schroeder-Kurth T. Wegner R-D. Gille J.J. Buchwald M. Arwert F. Blood. 1995; 86: 2156-2160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of FANCF Mutant Constructs—The FANCF mutant constructs were generated by PCR with oligonucleotides encoding the amino acid substitutions or deleted regions of the FANCF sequence. We used as a template the FANCF cDNA clone 10 obtained by expression cloning (5de Winter J.P. Rooimans M.A. van der Weel L. van Berkel C.G. Alon N. Bosnoyan-Collins L. de Groot J. Zhi Y. Waisfisz Q.

The FANCF mutant R47A+F48A was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All FANCF mutants have been analyzed by sequencing to confirm that the desired changes had occurred and to exclude the presence of other PCR derived alterations. The mutants were subcloned into the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) and transfected in FA-F lymphoblasts, EUFA698. FANCF mutants 1–15del, and delC31, and wild-type FANCF-FLAG were also subcloned into the expression vector pIRESneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to generate stable cell lines. Expression of the mutant proteins in the stable cell lines was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with FANCF-specific antibodies. Sequence Analysis—FANCF mutants and the X. laevis FANCF IMAGE clone 3200942 (obtained from HGMP Resource Centre, Cambridge, UK), were subcloned in pBluescript SK- and were sequenced with CY5.5-labeled T7 and T3 primers using a Thermo Sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Products were analyzed on a Visible Genetics automatic DNA sequencer (Visible Genetics Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clontech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously described (15Medhurst A.L. Huber P.A. Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In brief, bait and prey constructs were sequentially transformed into AH109 yeast cells and selected on -Trp-Leu-His-Ade medium. The resulting colonies were tested for β-galactosidase expression with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal). To confirm interactions a yeast-mating assay was used where constructs were transformed separately into two different yeast strains and mating cultures plated onto selection medium as above. All constructs were tested for self-activation against a series of control plasmids and expression of the mutant proteins was verified by immunoblotting. Mammalian Two- and Three-hybrid Analysis—Human embryonic kidney cells 293, either untransfected or stably transfected with wild type or mutant (L554P) FANCC were plated onto 6-well plates. After 48 h, the cells were transiently transfected with FANCE cDNA fused to the GAL-4 activation domain (pVP16; Clontech) and the indicated FANCF constructs fused in-frame to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (pm; Clontech) (1 μg of each), together with a GAL4-driven reporter plasmid (G5E1bLUC, 0.2 μg). The luciferase activity was monitored after 24 h using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a single tube luminometer (DLReady, Berthold Detection Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All GAL4 constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame and each experimental data set was performed in triplicate to overcome the variability inherent to transfections. Transient expression of the FANCF constructs and stable expression of FANCC were confirmed by immunoblotting with FANCF and FANCC-specific antisera. Subcellular Fractionation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the lymphoblastoid cell lines were obtained as described previously (17Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Kruyt F.A. de Groot J. van der Weel L. Dijkmans L.M. Zhi Y. Arwert F. Scheper R.J. Youssoufian H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cell extracts (∼107 cells) were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors) and subjected to immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies, as previously described (14de Winter J.P. van der Weel L. de Groot J. Stone S. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. Scheper R.J. Kruyt F.A. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 18: 2665-2674Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged proteins. Immunoprecipitates or lysates were then separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and specific proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Homology between the Human and Xenopus FANCF Proteins—Since functionally important amino acids are well conserved between species, we searched several databases for FANCF homologs to obtain clues about functional domains. In the NCBI data base an IMAGE clone (3200942) was found, which represented the full-length Xenopus laevis homolog of FANCF (xFANCF). The cDNA was sequenced, and the predicted protein was aligned with the human FANCF sequence (Fig. 1). The overall homology between both sequences appeared to be limited (27% identity, 49% similarity) and dispersed over the whole molecule. However, relatively high sequence conservation was found in both the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. To test if this limited homology was sufficient to function in a human background, FLAG-tagged xFANCF was transfected into a cell line from an FA-F patient (EUFA698). Unlike the human protein, xFANCF was unable to complement the MMC hypersensitivity of the cells, despite of its proper expression (Fig. 2). The untagged xFANCF protein was also unable to complement the MMC defect in FA-F cells (data not shown), indicating that xFANCF is not able to restore the human FA pathway.Fig. 2Xenopus FANCF protein is not functional in human cells.A, MMC hypersensitive phenotype of the FA-F lymphoblastoid cell line EUFA698 is corrected by stable transfection with cDNA encoding human FANCF, but not with cDNA encoding Xenopus FANCF.

Cell lysates of the indicated cell lines were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with rabbit FANCA antiserum 89 and anti-FLAG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The FANCF Region Homologous to ROM Is Not Conserved and Not Essential for Function—FANCF was first described as a novel protein with homology to the prokaryotic RNA-binding protein ROM (5de Winter J.P. Rooimans M.A. van der Weel L. van Berkel C.G. Alon N. Bosnoyan-Collins L. de Groot J. Zhi Y. Waisfisz Q. Pronk J.C. Arwert F. Mathew C.G. Scheper R.K. Hoatlin M.E. Buchwald M. Joenje H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment shows that the FANCF region homologous to ROM (amino acids 145–209) is not well conserved between human and Xenopus FANCF. Furthermore, the amino acids essential for RNA binding (Gln-166 and Arg-173) are not identical in xFANCF. To further study this region, Arg-173 was changed into alanine and the mutant protein was tested for its ability to complement the MMC hypersensitivity of FA-F cells. Although this amino acid change abolished RNA binding in ROM (37Predki P.F. Nayak L.M. Gottlieb M.B. Regan L. Cell. 1995; 80: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it did not have an effect on the activity of FANCF (Fig. 3). Similarly, FANCF mutants of the glutamic acid that is identical between hFANCF and ROM (E172A and E172P) were still functional. These data suggest that the FANCF region homologous to ROM is unlikely to have an essential ROM-like function. The C Terminus of FANCF Binds Directly to FANCG—Relatively high sequence conservation was found in the C terminus of FANCF (Fig. 1). To study the function of this conserved region, several deletion constructs were generated and tested for their ability to complement the MMC hypersensitive phenotype of FA-F cells. Surprisingly, FANCF mutants with C-terminal deletions of 23, 31, or 40 amino acids all complemented the MMC hypersensitivity of FA-F cells (Fig. 4A), although the survival curves were slightly shifted toward a higher sensitivity when more amino acids were deleted. Consistent with the notion that FANCD2 monoubiquitination is required for MMC resistance, FA-F cells transfected with the delC31 mutant expressed monoubiquitinated FANCD2 under normal conditions and after MMC treatment (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the FANCF deletion mutants had a reduced interaction with FANCA and FANCG when compared with wild-type FANCF (Fig. 4B). Deletion of 31 or 40 amino acids completely abolished the interaction in this assay. Since FANCF has been shown to interact directly with FANCG (15Medhurst A.L. Huber P.A. Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Gordon S.M. Buchwald M. Blood. 2003; 102: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we tested the interaction between FANCG and the deletion mutants in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In both co-transformation and mating experiments the mutants with a deletion of 31 or 40 amino acids had a strongly reduced FANCG binding (Table I). These results demonstrate that the last 31–40 amino acids in the C terminus of FANCF are important for the direct interaction with FANCG. By interfering with the binding to FANCG, the interaction with FANCA is also disturbed, indicating that the C terminus of FANCF is binding the FANCA/FANCG subcomplex through FANCG.Table IYeast two-hybrid data of FANCG and the C-terminal deletion mutants of FANCFDNA-BDaBD, GAL4 binding-domain.: pGBK-FANCG DNA-ADbAD, GAL4 activation-domain.: pGAD-FANCF-delCReporter gene activationFANCF-delC23+++Co-transformations 1 and 2FANCF-delC31+FANCF-delC40+FANCF-delC23+++Mating assays 1 and 2FANCF-delC31+FANCF-delC40-a BD, GAL4 binding-domain.b AD, GAL4 activation-domain. Open table in a new tab The N Terminus of FANCF Is Involved in Binding of the FANCC/FANCE Subcomplex—We next evaluated the function of a deletion mutant that lacked the highly conserved first 15 amino acids of FANCF. The mutant FANCF protein was not able to complement the MMC hypersensitivity of FA-F cells, despite its proper expression and nuclear localization (Fig. 5). Although this mutant protein interacted with FANCA and FANCG, the interaction was weak compared with that of wild-type FANCF (Figs. 4B and 8B).Fig. 8The negatively charged amino acids in the first N-terminal α-helix of FANCF have an important function.A, MMC hypersensitive phenotype of the FA-F cell line EUFA698 is corrected after stable transfection of cDNAs encoding FANCF mutants in which the negatively charged amino acids Glu-2, Asp-9, and Glu-13 were mutated. Lymphoblastoid cell line HSC93 is shown as a wild-type control. B, cell lysates from FA-F lymphoblasts (EUFA698) and FA-F lymphoblasts stably transfected with the indicated FANCF mutants were immunoprecipitated with guinea pig anti-FANCF1–245 and immunoblotted with rabbit FANCA antiserum 89 and rabbit anti-FANCF1–374 to show the interaction between the different FANCF mutants and FANCA. C, deletion of 23 amino acids from the FANCF mutants in which the negatively charged amino acids were mutated does only affect the ability of the E2K+D9K+E13K mutant to complement the MMC hypersensitive phenotype of the FA-F cell line EUFA698. D, FANCF mutants in which the negatively charged amino acids were mutated are unable to complement the MMC hypersensitive phenotype of the FA-F cell line EUFA698 upon removal of the C-terminal 31 amino acids.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Unlike wild-type FANCF, which can be immunoprecipitated in a complex with FANCE, we did not detect any FANCE in a complex with the N-terminal deletion mutant of FANCF using antisera against FANCE (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the mutant protein did not restore the interaction among FANCE, FANCA, and FANCG that is observed in wild-type cells. Similarly, the C-terminal deletion mutant lacking the last 31 amino acids was unable to bind FANCE and could not form a stable FA complex (Fig. 6A). In a reciprocal experiment, FANCC and FANCE did not co-immunoprecipitate with the N-terminal deletion mutant (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results indicate that the N terminus of FANCF is essential for its function and is involved in the binding of FANCC and FANCE. An important question for functional studies is how these proteins associate in the core complex. Previously, no direct interaction between FANCF and FANCC or FANCE has been found in yeast two-hybrid assays (15Medhurst A.L. Huber P.A. Waisfisz Q. de Winter J.P. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 38Gordon S.M. Buchwald M. Blood. 2003; 102: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggesting that the association with FANCC and FANCE is indirect. We investigated these interactions in a mammalian two-hybrid assay and also in this assay FANCF did not interact with FANCC or FANCE (Fig. 6C), whereas an interaction between FANCC and FANCE was observed. We then sought to determine if the N terminus of FANCF might be involved in the binding of this FANCC/FANCE subcomplex, using a mammalian three-hybrid (M3H) system, with 293 cells stably overexpressing FANCC. In this assay, we observed a strong induction of the reporter gene when FANCF was cotransfected with FANCE (Fig. 6D), indicating that FANCC acts as a molecular bridge between FANCF and FANCE. As a control experiment, we used a 293 cell line stably overexpressing FANCC mutant L554P, which is defective in binding FANCE (16Pace P. Johnson M. Tan W.M. Mosedale G. Sng C.

Blood. 2003; 102: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and found no interaction between FANCF and FANCE (data not shown). To further extend these observations, we tested the FANCF N- and C-terminal deletion mutants in the M3H assay. In agreement with our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the FANCF mutant 1–15del completely failed to interact with FANCE, whereas the FANCF mutant delC31 had a reduced interaction (Fig. 6D). Collectively, these observations indicate that"

Cathepsin B, one of the best characterized mammalian cysteine peptidases, is classically regarded as a typical lysosomal enzyme. Within lysosomes, it exerts beneficial physiological functions but it can be detrimental or even life-threatening when it reaches the extracellular space, as documented in pathological situations such as cancer (1Yan S.Q.

Chan S.J. Bajkowski A.S. Steiner D.F. Frankfater A. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). While screening articular cartilage specimens, we ascertained the presence of CB(-2,3) in both healthy and osteoarthritic tissue and demonstrated the production of this message in cultures of normal chondrocytes and in chondrocytes modulated toward an osteoarthritic phenotype. Osteoarthritic cartilage from joints with active disease showed a preferential expression of the CB(-2,3) splice variant (7Berardi S. Lang A. Kostoulas G. Hörler D. Vilei E.M. Baici A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The CB(-2,3) message encodes a protein lacking the 17 amino acids of the signal peptide and the first 34 amino acids of the propeptide. In a study with four mammalian cell lines we demonstrated that the resulting truncated cathepsin B (tCB) is not processed as a regular preproenzyme via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus and cannot be targeted to its final location, the lysosome (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Moreover, cells expressing tCB died by nuclear fragmentation suggesting apoptosis (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem.

In COS cells transfected with constructs encoding tCB, the CB(-2,3) splice variant was found to be a functional message (10Mehtani S. Gong Q.M. Panella J. Subbiah S. Peffley D.M. Frankfater A. J.

The authors suggested an association of tCB with nuclei and not yet identified intracellular membranes, possibly the ER (10Mehtani S. Gong Q.M. Panella J. Subbiah S. Peffley D.M. Frankfater A. J.

Here we follow the fate of human tCB in HeLa cells transfected with constructs containing segments of variable length of the N-terminal region of tCB fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). We demonstrate that the truncated form of the enzyme contains a new N-terminal leader sequence that delivers it to the mitochondria instead of the lysosomes. In addition, the short leader sequence, present within the first 20 amino acids, is able to target GFP, a reporter protein not related to cathepsin B, to the mitochondrion. Cell Culture—HeLa cells, derived from a human cervix epithelioid carcinoma, were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units of penicillin, and 50 ng of streptomycin/ml. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Maintenance of the cell lines was achieved by weekly passaging. A stable cell line, H2-HeLa, expressing an ER-localized monomeric red fluorescent protein was derived from HeLa cells transfected with the vector ProlacRFPKDEL using Polyfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). The resident ER protein consisted of a preprolactin leader sequence at the N terminus, the monomeric red fluorescent protein, and finally the KDEL sequence. Selection was carried out in 40 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Plasmids—The human cathepsin B mRNA code, to which all sequences in this study refer, is the sequence of 1996 nucleotides under accession number L16510 at EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ. Plasmids were constructed by PCR using the primers listed in Table I (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) and vector 5′-(-2,3)CBL16GFP (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) containing the tCB-GFP fusion sequence as a template. The PCR products were ligated into the vector 5′-(-2)CBL16GFP, which was first digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Cloning procedures were performed as described (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared using Plasmid Midi kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection experiments, plasmids were purified using the EndoFree plasmid maxi kit of Qiagen. In all experiments, the start codon of GFP was omitted by PCR as described previously (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to guarantee the use of the start codons of cathepsin B rather than that of GFP in the fusion protein.Table IPrimers used for plasmid constructionPrimerSequence 5′-3′SignaltCB10rGTTGGATCCGGTACCACATAGCCTCTTCSignaltCB15rGTTGGATCCGGGCCCACCCAGGAAGSignaltCB20rGTTGGATCCTCTCTGGGGTGGCTTGGSignaltCB38rGTTGGATCCTTGTTCCCGTGCATCGAAGSignaltCB65rGTTGGATCCGGCTTCCACAGCCCCGAAGCBcd4forXholCGATCTCGAGATGAGCTACTTGAAGAGGCCBcdrevBamHICGATGGATCCGATCTTTTCCCAGTACGFPKDELNotrevGTTGCGGCCGCTTAAAGTTCATCCTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATGmRFPKDELNotrevGTTGCGGCCGCTTAAAGTTCATCCTTGATCTCGGCGCCGGTGGTGProLactGFPXhoforCAACTCGAGATGGACAGCAAAGTTCGTCGCAG Open table in a new tab The sequence for vector tCB-GFP was obtained by PCR with primers CBcd4forXhoI and CBcdrevBamHI using 5′-(-2,3)CBL16GFP as a template, followed by digestion with XhoI and BamHI.

Rohrer, unpublished data. All products were digested with XhoI and NotI and ligated into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) previously digested with XhoI and NotI. The sequences of all vectors were confirmed by sequencing. Differential Centrifugation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells in a 75-cm2 culture flask. After 24 h of incubation, cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine (molecular mass 25 kDa). A 1 mg/ml polyethyleneimine stock solution (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany) was prepared. Plasmids (17 μg/25-cm2 flask) were diluted in normal medium up to a total volume of 527 μl. 70 μl of polyethyleneimine were mixed with medium up to the same volume. Finally, the DNA- and polyethyleneimine-containing media were merged and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then the media were diluted with 9.2 ml of medium and slowly added to the cells after having removed the entire medium from the cells. 15 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by passing 10 times through a 25-gauge needle. The lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated from the pellets containing unbroken cells and nuclei. A protease inhibitor mixture containing benzamidine, pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin was added to the supernatants, and the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were concentrated by precipitating proteins with trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 100 °C. SDS gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The same volume of each sample was loaded to be able to directly compare the intensity of the bands. Western blotting was carried out using the monoclonal mouse antibody G1/139 against the lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1) (11Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and the mouse anti-GFP IgG (Roche Applied Science). Chemiluminescence detection was performed with anti-mouse antibodies using a light-emitting non-radioactive method (BM chemiluminescence POD, Roche Applied Science) and image capturing on Agfa Curix Ortho HTA films. MitoTracker Staining—HeLa cells were seeded on round coverslips (15-mm diameter, Assistant, Germany) in a medium lacking phenol red and left for 48 h to adhere. Transfection was carried out as described above by proportional scaling reagents to the area of a 12-well plate using a phenol red-deprived medium. 15 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 50 μl of fresh medium containing 100 nm MitoTracker Red (CM-H2XRos) solution (Molecular Probes, Leiden, the Netherlands). After washing with phenol red-deprived medium, incubating with fresh medium for another 45 min at 37 °C, washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixing for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline/glycine and mounted in ProLong® Antifade (Molecular Probes). Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy of the GFP-transfected and red-labeled cells was performed using a 100×/1.4 NA Plan Apochromat objective mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope and using the Zeiss LSM510 confocal scanning module (excitation at 488 and 543 nm). The cathepsin B sequence with the signal peptide, the propeptide, and the mature enzyme, is shown in Fig. 1A to illustrate the components of the structure of the enzyme relevant to this study. The constructs containing the segments of variable length of the N-terminal region of tCB-fused GFP used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1B together with their acronyms. tCB Constructs Are Not Targeted to the ER—We attributed the final cellular destination of the fusion proteins in HeLa cells by co-localization with specific markers of the ER and mitochondria using confocal fluorescence laser microscopy. We first investigated any possible association of tCB with the ER for tracking the classical pathway of lysosomal enzyme biosynthesis and processing. Depending on the length of the GFP constructs, a transfection of HeLa cells revealed two different locations of the fusion protein (Fig. 2, green, GFP). When only 10 or 15 amino acids of the tCB N terminus were present, the fluorescence product showed a typical cytosolic distribution. Fusion proteins containing 20, 38, or 65 amino acids of tCB, as well as the entire tCB, manifested a clear distribution as prolate and fibrous intracellular structures besides the cytosolic distribution. The percentage of cells showing these structures increased from ∼20% with the 20 aa construct to 50% with the 38 aa and to 60% with the 65 aa-tCB-GFP construct. Approximately 50% of the cells expressing the whole tCB protein contained a clear patch distribution of GFP-fluorescence. Compared with the 38aa-tCB-GFP and 65aa-tCB-GFP constructs, the fluorescence intensity of the product of the tCB-GFP construct was weaker, suggesting either a lower rate of expression or a shorter lifetime for this species. The red channel in Fig. 2 (ER) indicates the distribution of the ER monitored by stably transfecting HeLa cells with monomeric red fluorescent protein (12Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar) made resident in the ER by attaching the ER recycling motif KDEL. No co-localization of the green GFP signal and the red ER signal, which should produce yellow staining in the merge panels in Fig. 2, right column, could be detected. Cells showing only red color in the merge channel are those that do not express the cathepsin B-GFP proteins. Three-dimensional imaging clearly revealed that the green and red staining was not coincident. Mitochondrial Targeting of tCB Constructs—The red channel (MitoTracker) in Fig. 3 shows fluorescence staining of mitochondria in HeLa cells. The MitoTracker dye is a specific marker that becomes fluorescent after oxidation in active mitochondria. The GFP channel illustrates the same staining pattern as seen in Fig. 2, i.e. cytoplasmic fluorescence with the constructs coding the first 10 or 15 amino acids of the tCB sequence, with an increasing number of fluorescent patches when the number of those amino acids is 20 or more. Comparison of the GFP, MitoTracker, and merge channels of the constructs containing 10 and 15 aa reveals that the cytoplasmic GFP-fluorescence and MitoTracker-stained mitochondria do not co-localize. However, with 20 or more amino acids of the tCB sequence, the number of yellow intracellular structures in cells successfully transfected with the cathepsin B-GFP constructs increases and becomes predominant, indicating a co-localization of the chimerical cathepsin B products with mitochondria (Fig. 3, merge). This property is not only demonstrated by the yellow color in the merge channel but also by direct comparison of the GFP and MitoTracker channels. Mitochondrial staining with MitoTracker is only possible with living cells. Because transfection with the tCB-GFP construct resulted in cell death of the cells expressing the chimerical protein after a given period, staining as shown in Fig. 3 was performed at a time point preceding the onset of cell death symptoms. tCB Constructs Are Targeted to the Membrane Fraction of the Cell—A further proof for the presence of tCB in the membrane fraction is provided in Fig. 4 where Western blots of the cytosolic and the membrane fractions, separated by differential centrifugation, are shown. The membrane fraction contained proteins associated with intracellular organelles such as mitochondria and lysosomes. The cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4, 1) contained mainly the expression product of the 15aa-tCB-GFP construct and traces of the 65aa-tCB-GFP construct, whereas the product of the tCB-GFP construct could not be determined because of either low expression or rapid degradation. The membrane fraction (Fig. 4, 2) also contained the products of the 15aa-tCB-GFP and 65aa-tCB-GFP constructs but in this case with a much stronger signal for the latter. The band around 58 kDa revealed the presence of the tCB-GFP protein product in the membrane fraction, whose faint signal confirmed its low rate of expression (or rapid degradation) as commented in the experiments discussed above (Figs. 2 and 3). The blots shown in Fig. 4, 3 were stained for the LAMP-1 to compare the relative concentrations of the membrane fraction in samples A-D. Staining for LAMP-1 in Fig. 4, 1 was negative for all samples. The main band in Fig. 4, 2 corresponds to the protein encoded by the 65aa-tCB-GFP construct, and the two bands at lower molecular mass represent fragments of this protein generated by limited proteolysis. We submitted the bands shown in Fig. 4, 2 to N-terminal sequencing after immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and transfer to a sequencing membrane. However, even using a 30-fold higher protein load as that shown in Fig. 4, 2, we were unable to determine the sequence because, the proteins turned up to be N terminally protected. This experiment aimed at exploring any processing of the N-terminal leader sequence for mitochondrial import, which is usually cleaved off during transport of proteins into mitochondria (13Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Structural Evidence for Mitochondrial Import of tCB—Besides obtaining direct experimental evidence for a localization of tCB within mitochondria and not within lysosomes, we verified the theoretical potential of constructs containing 10, 15, 20, 38, and 65 amino acids of tCB fused to GFP to be targeted to mitochondria using the program Target P (14Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3597) Google Scholar). This procedure considers the presence of mitochondrial targeting peptides, which are thought to form an amphipathic α-helix of hydrophobic and basic amino acids positioned in a particular sequence within the first 65 residues of human tCB, and calculates the import scores of the constructs, i.e. their ability to code polypeptides targetable to mitochondria. The score for mitochondrial import of cathepsin B chimeras increased with the length of the N-terminal amino acid sequence derived from cathepsin B up to 38aa-tCB-GFP, and tCB was determined to be a mitochondrial protein in contrast to regular cathepsin B. Thus, after deleting the first 34 amino acids of the cathepsin B propeptide, the resulting truncated enzyme acquires an N-terminal sequence containing the characteristic signal of proteins predestined for mitochondrial import. This signal motif is typified by folding of part of the N-terminal segment into an amphipathic α-helix, with the hydrophobic surface on one side and the positively charged surface on the opposite side (13Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The published three-dimensional structure of human procathepsin B (15Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) clearly shows an α-helical segment beginning at Met-52, i.e. the starting sequence of tCB (Fig. 5). This helix is amphipathic with three residues (Met-52, Leu-55, and Leu-58) forming a hydrophobic surface on one side of the helix and two residues (Lys-56 and Arg-57) forming a positively charged surface at the opposite side. Using a computational approach with the program PSIPRED (16McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar) we tested the ability of the N-terminal segment of tCB to form this type of helix even in the absence of residues 18-51, i.e. in tCB. This calculation afforded the highest probability score for Leu-55 and Leu-58 to be present in an α-helical secondary structure in constructs bearing 20 or more amino acids of the N-terminal tCB sequence. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and are transported into mitochondria with the help of characteristic leader sequences. Precursor proteins possessing amphipathic helices in their N-terminal presequence are recognized by the Tom20 receptor of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex) and are then transported into the mitochondrial matrix through the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23). Only three hydrophobic residues of the leader sequence are necessary for binding in a hydrophobic groove of the Tom20 domain to promote transport (reviewed in Ref. 13Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GFP expressed in human cells is not targeted to organelles and remains in the cytosol. However, adding a leader sequence composed of at least 20 amino acids of the N terminus of the truncated human cathepsin B to GFP conveys GFP to the mitochondria. Thus, human tCB generated by the cathepsin B mRNA splice variant missing exons 2 and 3 possesses all prerequisites for being targeted to mitochondria, a property that is not shared with regular preprocathepsin B. This property is because of the presence of a latent mitochondrial import leader sequence, which is hidden in regular procathepsin B but becomes available when the new N terminus of tCB is created. Besides direct evidence from co-localization measurements, our claim is supported by the three-dimensional structural data of the cathepsin B molecule (15Turk D. Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and from theoretical prediction using the most reliable software available to date (14Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3597) Google Scholar, 16McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). The structural motif highlighted in Fig. 5, in particular the three hydrophobic residues defining a hydrophobic surface on one side of the amphipathic α-helix starting at residue 52, strongly suggests the role of this segment of the tCB sequence as a mitochondrial leader peptide. We illustrated in two previous contributions that the majority of cells transfected with the tCB construct died by nuclear fragmentation indicating an apoptotic cell death (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Zwicky R. Müntener K. Csucs G. Goldring M.B. Baici A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We confirm that this phenomenon always occurred after cell transfection with the construct containing the entire tCB sequence but was not observed when cells were transfected with constructs coding for 10-65 amino acids starting from the N terminus of tCB. Thus, twenty amino acids of the tCB sequence were necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting but the entire tCB molecule was required for promoting cell death. Lysosomal cathepsin B has been recognized as the dominant executioner peptidase in tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis of fibrosarcoma cells (17Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (18Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The last study (18Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) highlighted a beneficial role of cathepsin B, as opposed to its well known function in malignancy by facilitating invasion (1Yan S.Q. Sameni M. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). The participation of cathepsin B in the mechanism of apoptosis was identified in the upstream death signals as a link between the death receptor and the mitochondrial loop of caspase activation (19Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Although cathepsin B has been suggested to mediate apoptosis through the proteolytic processing of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid in vitro (20Stoka V. Turk B. Schendel S.L. Kim T.H. Cirman T. Snipas S.J. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Freeze H. Abrahamson M. Brömme D. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Yin X.M. Turk V. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3149-3157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), this view was challenged in a subsequent paper based on studies in vivo (21Houseweart M.K. Vilaythong A. Yin X.M. Turk B. Noebels J.L. Myers R.M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1329-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The key for understanding the mechanisms of lysosomal peptidase-dependent apoptosis relies thus far in the assumption of enzyme translocation from lysosomes to cytosol and nucleus, as seen for example in liver cell apoptosis (19Guicciardi M.E. Deussing J. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Svingen P.A. Peters C. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 22Roberts L.R. Adjei P.N. Gores G.J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results discussed in our present contribution represent a new concept and a possible alternative mechanism of cell death. In essence, an abnormal form of a cysteine peptidase designed for lysosomes can reach the mitochondria through modification of its biosynthetic route, which imitates the regular processing pathway of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. This situation is different from enzyme leakage or translocation from lysosomes, which can potentially reach the external surface of mitochondria and elicit undesired effects but does not possess the structural characteristics to be imported inside these organelles (17Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jaattela M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 18Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2045-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Alternative trafficking of another cysteine peptidase, cathepsin L, was recently shown to be responsible for enzyme targeting to the nucleus (23Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). This was accomplished through initiation of translation at a downstream AUG site leading to a cathepsin L form devoid of the signal peptide. Taken together, the newly discovered unusual properties of cathepsin B (this work) and of cathepsin L (23Goulet B. Baruch A. Moon N.S. Poirier M. Sansregret L.L. Erickson A. Bogyo M. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) point to a much wider role of “lysosomal” cysteine peptidases than previously expected and suggests new pathophysiological functions at extralysosomal sites. Establishing a link between tCB biosynthesis triggered by the cathepsin B mRNA splice variant missing exons 2 and 3 and cell death in vivo or in cell cultures is still elusive. We were not yet able to set up clear-cut experiments aimed at distinguishing morphologically and biochemically the mechanisms of cell death induced by known means or by the new one described in the present work. However, the regular occurrence of cell death following transfection with tCB-encoding constructs (8Müntener K. Zwicky R. Csucs G. Baici A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Zwicky R. Müntener K. Csucs G. Goldring M.B. Baici A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the preferred occurrence of the CB(-2,3) message in pathological tissues undergoing degeneration accompanied by cell death (4Baici A. Lang A. Hörler D. Kissling R. Merlin C. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1995; 54: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Berardi S. Lang A. Kostoulas G. Hörler D. Vilei E.M. Baici A. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggests a pathophysiological function for tCB at least in osteoarthritis. This notion well deserves further attention in other pathologies. We thank H.-P. Hauri for kindly providing the monoclonal antibody G1/139 against LAMP-1, R. Y.

Chem. 276, 47542–47549), binds MCL1, a protein of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. The fortilin-MCL1 interaction stabilizes and increases the half-life of fortilin but not necessarily of MCL1 (Zhang, D., Li, F., Weidner, D., Mnjoyan, Z. H., and Fujise, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 37430–37438). It is not known to what extent each protein depends on the other for its apoptotic activity. Here, we present evidence that fortilin and MCL1 are capable of functioning as antiapoptotic proteins independently of each other. Using a robust small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing system developed in our laboratory, we analyzed the cytoprotective effects of fortilin and MCL1 together and apart in U2OS cell lines exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in both monoclonal and polyclonal cell populations. When MCL1 was silenced by MCL1-targeted siRNA, fortilin was still able to protect cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, when fortilin was silenced by fortilin-targeted siRNA, MCL1 was also able to protect cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these data clearly suggest that fortilin and MCL1 can exert their cytoprotective activities independently of each other. The silencing of fortilin and MCL1 did not qualitatively change the subcellular localization of MCL1 and fortilin, respectively. The biological significance of fortilin-MCL1 interaction may be that it increases cellular resistance to apoptosis by allowing MCL1, an independently antiapoptotic protein, to stabilize another independently antiapoptotic protein, fortilin.

The biological significance of fortilin-MCL1 interaction may be that it increases cellular resistance to apoptosis by allowing MCL1, an independently antiapoptotic protein, to stabilize another independently antiapoptotic protein, fortilin. Fortilin is a 172-amino acid polypeptide that was originally identified by yeast two-hybrid library screening as a molecule that specifically interacted with MCL1, a protein of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Fortilin is also known as translationally controlled tumor protein (2Gross B. Gaestel M. Bohm H. Bielka H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Chitpatima S.T. Makrides S. Bandyopadhyay R. Brawerman G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Early analyses of fortilin in our laboratory revealed that its amino acid sequence is highly evolutionarily conserved; that fortilin is ubiquitous in normal tissues, especially in liver and kidney; and that it localizes in both the nucleus and cytosol. In addition, we found that its overexpression prevents HeLa and U2OS cells from undergoing etoposide-induced apoptosis and that antisense depletion of fortilin can induce MCF-7 cells to die spontaneously. Taken together, these findings have established fortilin as a unique antiapoptotic protein. Because the amino acid sequence of fortilin does not resemble that of either Bcl-2 family proteins or IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) and because fortilin specifically interacts with MCL1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, we first hypothesized that the antiapoptotic function of fortilin is mediated through MCL1. Intriguingly, we found that fortilin interacted only with MCL1, not with other Bcl-2 family proteins, suggesting that fortilin might be an MCL1-specific cofactor in the regulation of apoptosis (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). At that time, we devised our first-generation small interfering RNA (siRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 1The abbreviations used are: siRNA, small interfering RNA; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; ANOVA, analysis of variance. system, in which we could specifically and effectively knock down MCL1 or fortilin expression in vivo. Using this system, we unexpectedly found that MCL1 depletion by siRNA targeting MCL1 (siRNAMCL1) drastically reduced the intracellular concentration of fortilin, whereas the siRNA targeting fortilin (siRNAFortilin)-mediated depletion of fortilin did not affect the intracellular concentration of MCL1 (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Further investigation revealed that siRNAMCL1 did not affect the amount of fortilin transcripts in the cell in a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay and that siRNAMCL1-induced MCL1 silencing drastically shortened the half-life of fortilin protein in a pulse-chase assay. Finally, a fortilin point mutant that failed to interact with MCL1 (fortilinR21A) was degraded far more quickly than was wild-type fortilin in vivo. These data suggested that MCL1, through its binding to fortilin, stabilizes fortilin and that the turnover of MCL1 is not affected by fortilin (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We then asked whether these protein partners, fortilin and MCL1, could function as antiapoptotic proteins in the absence of each other. We first attempted to address the question by generating cell lines that could stably express fortilin and fortilinR21A. Unfortunately, it was not possible to generate cells that would stably and robustly express fortilinR21A, most likely because of the rapid degradation of fortilinR21A. We then modified the siRNA system further, which eventually allowed us to knock down MCL1 and fortilin expression for extended periods of time (up to 120 h). This second-generation siRNA system, which we used in the current work, is unique in that the MCL1-targeting siRNA represented a mixture of four different siRNAs, directed against four different regions of MCL1 mRNA. The same was true for siRNA targeted against fortilin. This system, together with cells stably overexpressing wild-type fortilin or MCL1, finally provided us with a tool to evaluate whether MCL1 and fortilin could function antiapoptotically in the absence of each other. The data presented here suggest that they can. Cells, Cell Lines, and Culture Conditions—U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Small Interfering RNA System—Small interfering RNAs (5Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar, 6Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The siRNAFortilin actually consisted of a mixture of four siRNA duplexes targeting four different regions of fortilin mRNA, namely, AGATGTTCTCCGACATCTA, CGAAGGTACCGAAAGCACA, GGGAGATCGCGGACGGGTT, and GGTACCGAAAGCACAGTAA. Similarly, the siRNA against MCL1 (siRNAMCL1) actually consisted of a mixture of four siRNA duplexes targeting four different regions of MCL1 mRNA, namely, AAACGGGACTGGCTAGTTA, TCACAGACGTTCTCGTAAG, CGAGTGATGATCCATGTTT, and GGGACTGGCTAGTTAAACA. The siRNA against luciferase, a nonmammalian protein from Photinus pyralis (American firefly), was used as a control. All procedures were performed in an RNase-free environment as previously described in detail by us (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfection of cells with siRNA duplexes was performed using TransIT-TKO transfection kits (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI), at a final concentration of 1.1%. To minimize the cytotoxicity of the reagent itself, cells were washed once with PBS, and media were changed 6 h after transfection. Western Blot Analysis of Cell Lysates—Cells were harvested by the direct addition of SDS gel loading buffer (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Lysate samples were collected and incubated at 45 °C for 1 h. The genomic DNA in the lysate was sheared by passing the lysate through 27-gauge needles five times. When appropriate, cells were harvested into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets; Roche Applied Science)), followed by the determination of protein concentrations using BCA methods (Bio-Rad). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, using anti-fortilin, anti-MCL1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (Roche Applied Science) antibodies, as described previously (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Fujise K. Zhang D. Liu J. Yeh E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Trypan Blue Assay—Trypan blue assays of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-challenged cells were performed as described previously (8Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F. Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in the absence of Zeocin (Invitrogen). In brief, cells were harvested by brief trypsinization 24 h (and 48 h in the absence of siRNA treatments) after the addition of 5-FU (Sigma). Both floating and attached cells were assayed. At least 150 cells per treatment were counted after being stained with trypan blue at a final concentration of 0.2%. Assays were performed in duplicate. Generation of Cells Stably Overexpressing Fortilin or MCL1—To generate U2OS cells stably overexpressing either fortilin or MCL1, U2OS cells were transfected, using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), with pcDNA4-His-Max (pcDNA4), a mammalian expression vector containing a Zeocin selection marker (Invitrogen), containing the cDNA encoding either wild-type fortilin (pcDNA4Fortilin-HA) or MCL1 (pcDNA4MCL1-HA). For control, U2OS cells were transfected with empty pcDNA4. Both the fortilin and MCL1 cDNAs were fused with the nucleotide sequence encoding for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) at their 3′ termini. For the generation of monoclonal populations of cells, transfected cells were clonally selected for at least 3 weeks by using 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and characterized by Western blot analyses using commercial anti-MCL1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-fortilin antibodies raised in our laboratory (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The resulting lines were named U2OSempty, U2OSfortilin, and U2OSMCL1, respectively. To generate polyclonal cell populations, cells transfected with pcDNA4Fortilin-HA and pcDNA4MCL1-HA were selected collectively in a large tissue culture dish for 4 weeks with 1500 and 800 μg/ml Zeocin, respectively, and characterized by Western blot analyses using commercial anti-MCL1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-fortilin antibodies raised in our laboratory (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The resulting lines were named U2OSFortilin-poly and U2OSMCL1-poly, respectively. Ten and four clones were pooled for U2OSMCL1-poly and U2OSFortilin-poly, respectively. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—For the intracellular localization of fortilin and MCL1 in the presence or absence of each other, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA4Fortilin-HA or pcDNA4MCL1-HA and then treated with siRNAFortilin, siRNAMCL1, or siRNALuciferase and finally subjected to immunocytochemical staining 48 h later, using mouse anti-HA antibody (Covance) and rabbit anti-fortilin or anti-MCL1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected by goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then subjected to nuclear staining by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Stained cells were analyzed on a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope, using a ×40 objective and appropriate filter sets (Carl Zeiss Ltd.) as described previously (1Li F. Zhang D. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47542-47549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Spot RT SE6 Slider Camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) and the Image Pro Plus software system (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Subcellular Fractionation Procedure—U2OS cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded onto three 10-cm dishes. The next day, cells were transfected with siRNALuciferase, siRNAFortilin, or siRNAMCL1 as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and cytosolic and nuclear fractions were separated using the N-PER kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (10Thompson D.L. Gerlach-Bank L.M. Barald K.F. Koenig R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA methods (Bio-Rad). Exactly 10 μg of total proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analyses. The successful purification of nuclear and cytosolic fractions was confirmed by Western blot analyses using anti-histone H1 (clone AE-4; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies. A Robust siRNA System for Knockdown of MCL1 and Fortilin Has Been Developed—To determine the feasibility of creating a microenvironment in which MCL1, fortilin, or both can be selectively depleted, we generated siRNAs against MCL1 (siRNAMCL1) and fortilin (siRNAFortilin). We then tested these siRNAs for their ability to knock down expression of the target proteins. When U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAMCL1, MCL1 expression was knocked down to an undetectable level within 12 h (Fig. 1A,top panel). Similarly, siRNAFortilin was able to knock down fortilin expression, although it took up to 48 h to do so (Fig. 1A,bottom panel). Higher siRNAFortilin concentrations did not shorten the time required for complete silencing (data not shown). Treatment of cells with TransIT (Mirus Corp.) alone did not affect the intracellular levels of MCL1 and fortilin (Fig. 1B,N versus T). Surprisingly, once knocked down, MCL1 and fortilin expression remained undetectable for as long as 120 h. In addition, in dose-response experiments, we found that 25 nm siRNAMCL1 and 25 nm siRNAFortilin were sufficient to completely knock down MCL1 and fortilin, respectively (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we found that it was possible to silence both MCL1 and fortilin at the same time by introducing both siRNAMCL1 and siRNAFortilin into the cells simultaneously (Fig. 1C). With 25 nm each of siRNAMCL1 and siRNAFortilin, both MCL1 and fortilin were silenced within 24 h (Fig. 1C). These data suggested that it is possible to quickly and persistently silence MCL1 and/or fortilin expression in U2OS cells by a single transfection with siRNAMCL1 and/or siRNAFortilin. The concentrations of siRNA needed to achieve silencing in our system were substantially lower than those described previously by us (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and by others (6Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar). Depletion of Fortilin or MCL1 Increases the Susceptibility of Cells to 5-FU-induced Cell Death, Whereas Overexpression of Fortilin or MCL1 Protects Cells from 5-FU-induced Cell Death—We also developed a system in which we could evaluate the viability of cells treated with siRNAs. First, U2OS cells were treated with 25 nm siRNA, incubated for 48 h, and then incubated with 1 mm 5-FU for another 24 h. Then, cells were subjected to trypan blue assay for the assessment of cell viability. As shown in Fig. 2A, silencing of fortilin and MCL1 was associated with a significantly greater rate of 5-FU-induced cell death than was treatment with irrelevant siRNALuciferase (siRNALuciferaseversus siRNAFortilin, 49.0 ± 3.6% versus 63.3 ± 2.65%, p < 0.005; siRNALuciferaseversus siRNAMCL1, 49.0 ± 3.6% versus 63.3 ± 5.2%, p < 0.005, by two-sample t tests). Next, we established a U2OS cell line overexpressing MCL1 or fortilin, characterized these cells, and tested them for their susceptibility to 5-FU (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results of the siRNA experiments described above, overexpression of either MCL1 or fortilin made the cells more resistant to 5-FU treatment (U2OSEmptyversus U2OSFortilin, 55.8 ± 4.0% versus 31.3 ± 4.3%, p < 0.001; U2OSEmptyversus U2OSMCL1, 55.8 ± 4.0% versus 31.3 ± 5.6%, p < 0.001). These data confirmed that fortilin and MCL1 are prosurvival molecules whose overexpression and silencing make cells more and less resistant to cytotoxic stimuli, respectively. Depletion of Fortilin and MCL1 Does Not Change the Intracellular Localization of Each One's Protein Partner (MCL1 and Fortilin, Respectively)—Considering that fortilin and MCL1 specifically interact with each other (4Zhang D. Li F. Weidner D. Mnjoyan Z.H. Fujise K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether the depletion of intracellular fortilin and MCL1 would change the intracellular localization of MCL1 and fortilin, respectively. First, we transfected U2OS cells with pcDNA4Fortilin-HA or pcDNA4MCL1-HA and then with siRNAFortilin, siRNAMCL1, or siRNALuciferase. Cells were stained with anti-HA, anti-fortilin (in cases of fortilin silencing) or anti-MCL1 (in cases of MCL1 silencing), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The introduction of siRNAMCL1 and siRNAFortilin into cells was associated with significant reduction of MCL1 and fortilin signals, respectively (Fig. 3A,c versus f and i versus l). In this system, the intracellular localization of fortilin and MCL1, as assessed by signals from anti-HA staining, was identical regardless of the silencing of MCL1 and fortilin, respectively (Fig. 3A,b versus e and h versus k). As shown by immunocytochemistry, fortilin localized predominantly in the nucleus and somewhat in cytosol, whereas MCL1 localized predominantly in the cytosol and somewhat in the nucleus. Next, we fractionated the lysate from cells that had been treated with either siRNAMCL1, siRNAFortilin, or siRNALuciferase into cytosolic and nuclear fractions. As shown in Fig. 3B, Western blot analyses revealed that α-tubulin was detectable only in the cytosolic fraction, and histone H1 was detectable only in the nuclear fraction, suggesting that the cytosolic and nuclear fractions did not cross-contaminate each other. In addition, the treatment with siRNAMCL1 depleted MCL1 in both the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 3B,lanes 3 and 6). Similarly, treatment with siRNAFortilin depleted fortilin in both the nucleus and cytosol (Fig. 3B,lanes 2 and 5). In this system, we asked whether the depletion of fortilin and MCL1 changed the predominant intracellular localization of MCL1 and fortilin, respectively. Before fortilin silencing, MCL1 localized predominantly in the cytosol and somewhat in the nucleus (Fig. 3B,lanes 1 and 4, MCL1), consistent with the immunostaining data reported above. Upon fortilin silencing, this pattern of cytosolic predominance persisted (Fig. 3B,lanes 3 and 6, MCL1). Before its silencing, fortilin localized somewhat more in the cytosol than in the nucleus in this system (Fig. 3B,lanes 1 and 4, Fortilin). Upon MCL1 silencing, this pattern again persisted (Fig. 3B,lanes 2 and 5, MCL1). Together, these data suggested that the depletion of MCL1 and fortilin by siRNA does not change the intracellular localization of their protein partners, namely, fortilin and MCL1, respectively. Fortilin Prevents Cells from Undergoing Cell Death in the Absence of Its Protein Partner, MCL1—Next, we further characterized U2OSFortilin-8, one of the clones of U2OS cells overexpressing fortilin, using U2OSEmpty-1 as control. Trypan blue assay showed that U2OSFortilin-8 cells were significantly more resistant to 5-FU-induced cell death than were U2OSEmpty-1 cells (Fig. 4A,p < 0.005 by ANOVA). We then evaluated our first principal hypothesis, namely, that fortilin was capable of blocking cell death even in the absence of MCL1. Specifically, we transfected U2OSEmpty-1 and U2OSFortilin-8 cells with siRNAFortilin, siRNAMCL1, or siRNALuciferase; challenged the cells with 1 mm 5-FU for 24 h; and finally determined their viability using the trypan blue assay. Consistent with data reported above (Figs. 2B and 4A), fortilin-overexpressing cells (U2OSFortilin-8) were more resistant to 5-FU-induced cell death than were control cells (U2OSEmpty-1) (Fig. 4B, U2OSFortilin-8 (lane 6) versus U2OSEmpty-1 (lane 5): 33.4 ± 0.6% versus 54.5 ± 0.4%, p < 0.005 by two-sample t test). When native fortilin expression was knocked down by siRNAFortilin in U2OSEmpty-1 cells (Fig. 4B, Western blot, lane 4 versus lane 5, Fortilin), the loss of native fortilin was associated with an increase in cell susceptibility to 5-FU treatment (no fortilin (lane 4) versus native fortilin (lane 5) in U2OSEmpty-1 cells: 61.3 ± 1.1% versus 54.5 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05 by two-sample t test). Thus, intracellular fortilin levels consistently and significantly correlated with the degree of cell survival (Fig. 4B, no fortilin (lane 4) versus native fortilin (lane 5) versus native plus overexpressed fortilin (lane 6), p < 0.001 by ANOVA). In other words, in the presence of native MCL1, the higher the intracellular levels of fortilin were, the lower the susceptibility of cells to 5-FU-induced cell death was (Fig. 4B,lanes 4–6). In still other words, fortilin had a dose-dependent anticytotoxic effect on 5-FU-challenged U2OS cells. We then asked whether the same dose dependence would be present in the essential absence of MCL1. We treated U2OSFortilin-8 and U2OSEmpty-1 cells with siRNAMCL1 to silence MCL1. In some cases, both MCL1 and fortilin were knocked down simultaneously by cotransfection of siRNAFortilin and siRNAMCL1 as optimized above (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the total amount of siRNA introduced into these cells was kept constant by the addition of siRNALuciferase, an irrelevant control siRNA. As shown in Fig. 4B, the introduction of siRNAMCL1 into the cells caused the intracellular level of native MCL1 to decrease to levels undetectable by Western blot analyses (Fig. 4B, Western blot, MCL1, lanes 1–3). In cases of double knockdown, Western blot analysis showed no significant signals of MCL1 or fortilin proteins (Fig. 4B,Western blot, MCL1 and Fortilin, lane 1). Strikingly, as assessed by trypan blue assay, the increasing intracellular concentration of fortilin was associated with increasing resistance to 5-FU-induced cell death even in the absence of MCL1 (Fig. 4B, no fortilin (lane 1) versus native fortilin (lane 2) versus native plus overexpressed fortilin (lane 3): 76.8 ± 0.7% versus 64.7 ± 0.5% versus 47.4 ± 0.1%, p < 0.001 by ANOVA). In other words, fortilin was equally capable of protecting cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in both the presence and absence of MCL1 and did so in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 4B,lanes 4–6 versus lanes 1–3). Together, these data suggested that fortilin does not require the presence of MCL1 to exert its antiapoptotic activity. MCL1 Prevents Cells from Undergoing Cell Death in the Absence of Its Protein Partner, Fortilin—Having established that fortilin does not require MCL1 in order to be antiapoptotic, we then asked whether the reverse was true. We first characterized U2OSMCL1–6, one of the clones of U2OS cells overexpressing MCL1, using U2OSEmpty-1 as a control. Trypan blue assay showed that U2OSMCL1–6 cells were significantly more resistant to 5-FU-induced cell death than were U2OSEmpty-1 cells (Fig. 5A,p < 0.01 by ANOVA, when comparing U2OSEmpty-1 and U2OSMCL1–6 cells). We then evaluated our second principal hypothesis, namely, that MCL1 is capable of blocking cell death even in the absence of fortilin, using the reagents and systems we had already characterized (Figs. 1, 2, and 5A). Specifically, we transfected U2OSEmpty-1 and U2OSMCL1–6 cells with siRNAFortilin, siRNAMCL1, or siRNALuciferase; challenged the cells with 1 mm 5-FU for 24 h; and then determined their viability using the trypan blue assay. In the presence of native fortilin, the higher the intracellular levels of MCL1 were, the lower the susceptibility of cells to 5-FU-induced cell death was (Fig. 5B, no MCL1 (lane 4) versus native MCL1 (lane 5) versus native plus overexpressed MCL1 (lane 6), 60.1 ± 2.1% versus 40.5 ± 1.7% versus 29.0 ± 0.4%, p < 0.01 by ANOVA). In other words, MCL1 protected U2OS cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion in the presence of native fortilin. We then set out to determine whether this dose dependence would hold in the absence of fortilin in the cells by treating U2OSMCL1–6 and U2OSEmpty-1 cells with siRNAFortilin to silence fortilin. In some cases, both MCL1 and fortilin were knocked down simultaneously by cotransfection of siRNAFortilin and siRNAMCL1 as optimized above (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 5B, the introduction of siRNAFortilin into the cells caused the intracellular level of fortilin to fall to undetectable levels (Fig. 5B,Western blot, Fortilin, lanes 1–3). In cases of double knockdown, Western blot analysis showed no significant signals for either MCL1 or fortilin protein (Fig. 5B, Western blot, MCL1 and Fortilin, lane 1). Strikingly, the increasing intracellular concentration of MCL1 in these cells was associated with increasing resistance to 5-FU-induced cell death in the absence of fortilin (Fig. 4B, no MCL1 (lane 1) versus native MCL1 (lane 2) versus native plus overexpressed MCL1 (lane 3), 74.6 ± 3.3% versus 60.2 ± 7.4% versus 32.9 ± 0.9%, p < 0.01 by ANOVA). In other words, MCL1 was equally capable of protecting cells from 5-FU-induced cytotoxicity in both the presence and absence of fortilin and did so in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5B,lanes 4–6 versus lanes 1–3). Together, these data suggested that MCL1 does not require the presence of fortilin to protect U2OS cells from 5-FU-induced cell death. In Polyclonal Cell Populations, Fortilin Prevents Cells from Undergoing Cell Death in the Absence of Its Protein Partner, MCL1, and Vice Versa—To make certain that the independent cytoprotective effects of protein partners fortilin and MCL1 represented in Figs. 4 and 5 did not originate from the selection process associated with the establishment of monoclonal cell populations, we generated polyclonal populations of U2OS cells that stably expressed fortilin (U2OSFortilin-poly) or MCL1 (U2OSMCL1-poly). Western blot analyses showed that U2OSFortilin-poly and U2OSMCL1-poly cells robustly overexpressed fortilin and MCL1, respectively (Figs. 6A and 7A).Fig. 7MCL1 protects cells from undergoing cell death in the absence of its protein partner, fortilin, as shown in studies using polyclonal cell populations.A, characterization of a polyclonal population of U2OS cells stably expressing MCL1 (U2OSMCL1-poly). Western blot analyses using anti-MCL1, anti-fortilin, and anti-actin antibodies showed that U2OSMCL1-poly cells contained a significan"
https://openalex.org/W2080981484,"We describe the isolation and characterization of a new apaf-1-interacting protein (APIP) as a negative regulator of ischemic injury. APIP is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and heart and binds to the CARD of Apaf-1 in competition with caspase-9. Exogenous APIP inhibits cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, and suppresses cell death triggered by mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli through inhibiting the downstream activity of cytochrome c released from mitochondria. Conversely, reduction of APIP expression potentiates mitochondrial apoptosis. APIP expression is highly induced in mouse muscle affected by ischemia produced by interruption of the artery in the hindlimb and in C2C12 myotubes created by hypoxia in vitro, and the blockade of APIP up-regulation results in TUNEL-positive ischemic damage. Furthermore, forced expression of APIP suppresses ischemia/hypoxia-induced death of skeletal muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest that APIP functions to inhibit muscle ischemic damage by binding to Apaf-1 in the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosis pathway.

Apaf-1 has been identified as the mammalian homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans ced-4, which is a core component of the cell death machine (together with ced-3 and ced-4) and plays a crucial role in the general apoptotic program of normal development and pathogenesis (1Yuan J.

Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 and, when dATP is added to the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1, the oligomeric complex of Apaf-1 forms and leads to the recruitment of caspase-9 to form apoptosome and activates caspase-9 (15Hu Y.

Apaf-1-deficient mice exhibit reduced apoptosis in the brain and striking craniofacial abnormalities with hyperproliferation of neuronal cells. The thymocytes from Apaf-1 knockout mice fail to undergo apoptosis after treatment with various apoptotic stimuli.

Therefore, identification of such molecules as Boo and Hsp70 as regulators of Apaf-1-mediated cell death will be important (24Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C.

However, the control circuit to regulate ischemic damage to skeletal muscle is largely unknown.In this study, we isolated and characterized the Apaf-1-interacting protein, APIP. 1The abbreviations used are: APIP, Apaf-1-interacting protein; AS, anti-sense; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; CHX, cycloheximide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; FADD, fas-associated protein with death domain. 1The abbreviations used are: APIP, Apaf-1-interacting protein; AS, anti-sense; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; CHX, cycloheximide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; FADD, fas-associated protein with death domain. APIP is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and its expression regulates Apaf-1-mediated cell death. In particular, APIP expression is induced during ischemia as a necessary step leading to the suppression of hypoxia-induced muscle cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Assay—The CARD region (amino acids 1-89) of Apaf-1 was used as bait in conventional yeast two-hybrid screening using pLexA vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and Jurkat cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Plasmid Construction—The CARD of Apaf-1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamH′ site of pLexA (pLexA-CARD). The mouse CARD of Apaf-1 was subcloned into BamH′ and Xho′ site of pcDNA-FLAG (pmCARD-FLAG). cDNAs encoding the full open reading frames of APIP and APIP2 were subcloned into the Xho′ site of pcDNA3-HA (pHA-APIP) and pEGFP (pGFP-APIP). Antisense cDNAs of APIP and FADD were subcloned into pcDNA3-HA (pAS-APIP) and pEGFP (pAS-FADD), respectively. Deletion mutants of APIP were generated by PCR and subcloned into the Xho′ site of pcDNA3-HA. To generate GST-APIP protein, the CARD of Apaf-1 and ΔA (amino acids 16-204) of APIP were subcloned into the BamH′ site of pGEX5X-1 (pGEX-CARD and pGEX-APIP).Antibody Generation—BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pGEXAPIP and incubated with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-α-d-galactopyranoside. GST-APIP protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and injected four times into rabbit and mouse. Rabbit anti-APIP antibody was purified by antigen-affinity chromatography using SulfoLink kit (Pierce).Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blotting was performed using multiple tissues. The Northern blot membrane was from Clontech, and a 32P-labeled APIP probe was generated by the random prime kit (Amersham Biosciences).Reagents—Apaf-1 (-/-) and caspase-9 (-/-) MEFs were previously described (19Kuida K.

Etoposide, cis-PLATINUM(II)-Diammine dichloride, and staurosporin were purchased from Sigma. Soluble Fas ligands were obtained from the cultured supernatant of CHO-K1-Fas cells grown in serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFM II; Invitrogen). Active specific anti-caspase-9, anti-α-tubulin, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), anti-mouse IgG-HRP, anti-rat IgG-HRP, and anti-goat IgG-HRP antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz; anti-Apaf-1 monoclonal antibody (2E12) was from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland) (39Hausmann G.

After the GST pull-down assay, the precipitated proteins were washed with the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% (v/v) glycerol), separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiogram.Immunoprecipitation—HeLa and HEK293 cells were lysed in radio-immune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF]. APIP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates after incubation with anti-APIP antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C.

After single cell cloning, the clones were screened by Western blot analysis.Cell-free System—Preparation of HeLa S-100 fraction was previously described (4Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 3-μl aliquot of the in vitro translated caspase-3 was incubated with 80 μg of S-100 fraction in the presence or absence of 1 mm dATP, 2 μg/ml cytochrome c, and 2 μg or 10 μg of purified GST or GST-APIP proteins for 1 h at 30 °C.

Intact cells and nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min; the supernatants were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to fractionate membrane pellet and cytoplasm.Ischemia Induction in the Muscle of Mouse Hindlimb and TUNEL Assay—Ischemia was induced in 20-25-g male C57BL/6 mice by ligation of the femoral artery of the hindlimb. The operative procedures to generate ischemic muscle were previously described (40Couffinhal T. Silver M. Zheng L.P. Kearney M. Witzenbichler B. Isner J.M. Am. J.

The middle portion of the left hindlimb of the mouse was incised and ligated at both the proximal end of the femoral artery and the distal portion of the saphenous artery. All side and attached side branches were dissected free and then excised. The right hindlimbs of the mice were used as non-ischemic controls (n > 3, the number of mice). Mouse muscle tissues were injected with 25 μg of pAS-APIP using a glass capillary. After 2 days, unilateral hindlimb ischemia was induced for an additional day, and the affected muscles were examined for apoptosis by TUNEL analysis with ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kits (Intergen Company, Purchase, NY).Hypoxia and Differentiation Induction of C2C12 Skeletal Muscle Cells—C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (EQUITE-Bio, Kerrville, TX) in the presence of 5% CO2. Cell differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes were induced by incubating 80% confluent C2C12 cells with 2% horse serum for 4 days. Hypoxia was achieved by culturing the cells in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) in an air-tight Plexiglas chamber with GasPak Plus™ (BD Biosciences) as previously described (41Malhotra R.

From 10 million yeast transformants, we have isolated 12 putative positive clones including Hsp70. Among them, we designated an Apaf-1-interacting protein as APIP that is also described as CGI29 and MMRP19. APIP is predicted to encode a 204 amino acid protein containing the aldolase II domain and localizes on chromosome 11p13.11-11p13.12. In GenBank™ expressed-sequenced tag data base for human, we also found an isoform of APIP, APIP2 encoding a 242 amino acid protein, which is an alternative splicing variant from a single gene and different in its N terminus from APIP (Fig. 1A). Sequence alignment shows that the amino acid sequence of APIP is highly conserved among different species. Analysis with the BLAST data base revealed that there is a single APIP gene in mice (mAPIP) that is more similar to APIP2. When examined with Northern blotting, the tissue distribution of APIP revealed a transcript of APIP with an approximate size of 1.2 kb that was ubiquitously expressed in most adult tissues with high expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and kidney (Fig. 1B).In a yeast two-hybrid assay, APIP interacted with the CARD of Apaf-1, but not with the death domain of FADD (data not shown). In vitro GST pull-down assays showed that APIP and APIP2 interacted with the GST-CARD fusion protein as efficiently as the caspase-9 short form did, but they did not interact with GST (Fig. 2A). APIP did not bind to other CARD-containing proteins such as pro-caspase-9 (data not shown). The radiolabeled APIP pulled down by GST-CARD represented about 10% of input. The endogenous interaction of APIP and Apaf-1 was examined in HeLa cells. An immunoprecipitation assay using anti-APIP antibody showed that Apaf-1 and APIP were detected in the immunoprecipitates, indicating that endogenous APIP interacts with Apaf-1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, upper panel). We also were able to demonstrate an interaction of exogenous Apaf-1 with APIP by an immunoprecipitation assay of HEK293F cells transfected with HA-tagged APIP and Apaf-1 (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Intracellular interaction of APIP with the CARD of Apaf-1 was further examined after transfection with pmCARD-FLAG and pHA-APIP (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody following immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody showed that APIP interacted with Apaf-1 via CARD in the cells. Sub-cellular fractionation analysis showed that APIP was found in the cytosol as Apaf-1 (data not shown).Fig. 2Interaction of APIP with the CARD region of Apaf-1.A, in vitro binding assay. GST and GST-CARD proteins were expressed and purified. Proteins bound to their affinity resins (each equivalent to 20 μg of proteins) were incubated with in vitro translated APIP protein in the presence of [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Caspase-9S protein was used as a positive control. After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE, the bound proteins were detected by autoradiography (upper panel), and resin-coupled proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (lower panel). Right panel represents 10% of input, radiolabeled APIP. B, intracellular interaction. Endogenous APIP protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) from HeLa cell extracts with preimmune serum (Pre) or anti-APIP antibody (APIP) (upper panel). HEK293F cells were overexpressed with Apaf-1 and HA-tagged APIP, and immunoprecipitated with anti-APIP antibody (APIP) (middle panel). Cell extracts prepared from HEK293 cells co-transfected with pmCARD-FLAG and pHA-APIP were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (HA) (lower panel). The immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates (Lysate) were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with the indicated antibodies.

To examine the role of APIP in cell death, we generated a C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line that stably expressed APIP (C2C12/APIP) (Fig. 3A). C2C12 or C2C12/APIP cells were exposed to various cell death stimuli. Determination of cell viability showed that overexpression of APIP suppressed apoptosis induced by etoposide, cisplatin, or staurosporin, stimuli that are known to activate the mitochondrial pathway, but APIP failed to suppress apoptosis triggered by soluble Fas ligand or TNF-α (Fig. 3A). Such inhibitory activity of APIP was also observed over 3 days in C2C12 cells and in other cells such as HeLa and HEK293 cells treated with the mitochondrial stress signals (data not shown).Fig. 3Suppression of etoposide- and tBid-triggered cell death by APIP without affecting cytochrome c release from mitochondria. C2C12 or C2C12 cells stably expressing APIP (C2C12/APIP) were left untreated (CTRL) or exposed to etoposide (Etop., 25 μg/ml), cisplatin (Cisp., 100 ng/ml), staurosporin (Stau., 50 nm), TNF-α (TNF/CHX, 30 ng/ml), or soluble Fas ligand (s-Fas, 0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h. A, cell viability (% of cell death) was determined by trypan blue and TUNEL assays. B, cells exposed to etoposide (25 μg/ml) were stained with anti-cytochrome c antibody and Hoechst 33258. The arrows indicate the typical diffused and cytosolic pattern of cytochrome c and morphology of nuclei in the same cells. C, C2C12 and C2C12/APIP cells were treated with etoposide (Etop., 50 μg/ml) for 12 h. Cell extracts were separated into membrane and cytosolic fractions, and the fractionated extracts were subsequently immunoblotted with anti-cytochrome c, anti-COX4, or anti-tubulin antibody (left panel). The cell extracts were also probed with anti-active caspase-9, anti-active caspase-3, or anti-tubulin antibody (right panel). Asterisk (*) indicates nonspecific signal. D, HeLa cells were transfected with ptBid alone or together with pGFP-APIP or pGFP-APIP2 for 24 h. Cell viability was then determined based on the morphology of GFP-positive cells.

E, wild type, Apaf-1 (-/-), or caspase-9 (-/-) MEFs were transfected with pGFP or pGFP-APIP for 24 h and then exposed to etoposide (Etop., 25 μg/ml) or TNF-α (TNF/CHX, 10 ng/ml) for 12 h. Cell viability (% of cell death) was determined by trypan blue assays of GFP-positive cells. Bars depict means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further assessed the function of APIP in Apaf-1-mediated cell death. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that cytochrome c in the mitochondria was released into the cytosol of C2C12 cells exposed to etoposide and undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3B). However, expression of APIP-protected C2C12 cells from etoposide-induced apoptosis despite cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Fractionation analysis followed by Western blotting also showed that cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria in both C2C12/APIP and C2C12 cells exposed to etoposide (Fig. 3C, left panel). In contrast to C2C12 cells, however, activation of caspase-9 or caspase-3, the downstream caspases of cytochrome c, was suppressed in the etoposide-treated C2C12/APIP cells (Fig. 3C, right panel). These results indicate that APIP protects cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the downstream activity of cytochrome c released from mitochondria. To explore the role of APIP as an apoptosis suppressor, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with tBid, the cleavage product of Bid by caspase-8. The tBid-triggered apoptosis was efficiently suppressed by co-expression of APIP (death rates from 62 to 35%) (Fig. 3D), indicating that APIP functions as an anti-apoptotic molecule in the mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway.Anti-apoptotic activity of APIP was examined in Apaf-1 (-/-) or caspase-9 (-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). As reported earlier, Apaf-1 (-/-) or caspase-9 (-/-) MEFs were resistant to cell death triggered by etoposide but not by TNF/CHX (Fig. 3E). Overexpression of APIP in the wild-type MEFs suppressed etoposide-induced cell death to the level of Apaf-1 (-/-) or caspase-9 (-/-) MEFs. The anti-apoptotic function of APIP was further examined by using antisense approaches. Direct targeting of APIP expression with antisense cDNA potently increased apoptosis induced by cisplatin but not by soluble Fas ligand, while antisense cDNA of FADD inhibited apoptosis in the opposite manner in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). Expression of antisense cDNAs of APIP in HEK293 and HeLa cells apparently diminished the expression level of APIP as determined by Western blot (Fig. 4B) and immunocytochemical analysis (data not shown), respectively. Similarly, antisense cDNA of FADD reduced expression level of FADD and was used as a control for the non-mitochondrial apoptotic signal. These results are more illustrative of the role of APIP as an anti-apoptotic molecule.Fig. 4Potentiation of cell death by antisense (AS) cDNA of APIP.A, HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP and either pcDNA (CTRL), pAS-APIP, or pAS-FADD were exposed to cisplatin or soluble Fas ligand for 48 h.

B, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP and either pcDNA (CTRL), pAS-APIP, or pAS-FADD for 48 h, and the expression levels of endogenous APIP and FADD were examined by Western blotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Suppression of Cytochrome c-mediated Activation of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9—The CARD of caspase-9 binds to the CARD of Apaf-1 for its activation. As molecules interacting with the CARD of Apaf-1, competitive binding between caspase-9 and APIP to Apaf-1 was examined in vitro (Fig. 5A). In vitro GST pull-down assays showed that increasing the amounts of caspase-9 in the reaction mixtures proportionally reduced the amounts of APIP interacting with the CARD of Apaf-1, while binding of caspase-9 to the CARD of Apaf-1 gradually increased. These results indicate that APIP and caspase-9 may compete with each other for binding to Apaf-1. To examine the anti-apoptotic activity of APIP in Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase, a cell-free system containing S-100 fraction was employed. Incubation of S-100 fraction with dATP and cytochrome c induced proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 5B). However, activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were suppressed by incubating the S-100 fraction with purified GST-APIP, but not with GST, suggesting that APIP inhibited the cytochrome c-mediated activation of caspase and further supporting the intracellular anti-apoptotic activity of APIP functioning downstream of the cytochrome c released from mitochondria, as shown in Fig. 3, B and C.Fig. 5Suppression of cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3 by APIP in vitro: competitive interaction of APIP and caspase-9 with the CARD of Apaf-1.A, purified GST-CARD was incubated with 35S-labeled, in vitro translated APIP in the presence of increasing amounts of 35S-labeled, in vitro translated caspase-9. The reaction volumes and the amounts of total protein were adjusted same by adding reticulocyte lysate containing in vitro translated luciferase to the reaction mixture. After GST pull-down assay, the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to x-ray film. Lower graph indicates densitometric analysis of APIP protein remaining on GST-CARD.

https://openalex.org/W1983508553,"The Lin12-Notch repeat (LNR) module of about 35 residues is a hallmark of the Notch receptor family. Three copies, arranged in tandem, are invariably present in the extracellular portion of the Notch receptors. Although their function is unknown, genetic and biochemical data indicate that the LNR modules participate in the regulation of ligand-induced proteolytic cleavage of the Notch receptor, a prerequisite to intramembrane cleavage and Notch signaling. Outside the Notch receptor family, the LNR module is present only in the metalloproteinase pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and its homologue PAPP-A2, which also contain three copies. Curiously, LNR modules 1 and 2 are present within the proteolytic domain of PAPP-A/A2, but LNR3 is separated from LNR2 by more than 1000 amino acids. The growth factor antagonists insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-4 and -5 are both substrates of PAPP-A. We provide here evidence that the PAPP-A LNR modules function together to determine the proteolytic specificity of PAPP-A. Analysis of C-terminally truncated PAPP-A mutants followed by the analysis of LNR deletion mutants demonstrated that each of the three PAPP-A LNR modules is strictly required for proteolytic activity against IGFBP-4 but not for proteolytic activity against IGFBP-5.

The activity of the latter mutants against IGFBP-4 could be partially rescued by calcium, and the addition of the calcium-binding protein calbindin D9k to wild-type PAPP-A eliminated activity against IGFBP-4 but not against IGFBP-5, demonstrating that the PAPP-A LNR modules bind calcium ions.

The EC subunit has a large but variable number of EGF-like repeats and always three uninterrupted LNR modules. The intracellular portion of the TM-IC subunit contains sequence elements, including adjacent ankyrin repeats, which interact directly with transcription factors (21Kimble J. Henderson S.

The ligands of Notch receptors are extracellular domains of specific surface molecules expressed on adjacent cells. Upon ligand binding, the Notch receptor becomes susceptible to proteolytic cleavage at S2 (Fig. 1D).

Curiously, although the number of modules is conserved between Notch and PAPP-A, the en bloc occurrence in the Notch receptors is not. We have studied the function of the LNR modules of PAPP-A, and we present here data demonstrating that they bind calcium and determine the proteolytic specificity of PAPP-A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Mutants of the 1547-residue human PAPP-A polypeptide were obtained using three pBluescript II SK+ vectors, each containing PAPP-A cDNA corresponding to residues 1–407 (pB1–407), 2The numbering of the mature PAPP-A polypeptide (18Kristensen T.

Outer primers, derived from pBluescript II SK+, were 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ and 5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. At least two independent clones of each construct were used for further analysis. Plasmid pB1–407 was used for the construction of mutants d[Cys334–Cys360], d[Ala367–Cys393], d[Cys334–Cys393], D341A, D356A, D359A, N374A, D389A, and E392A.

The blots were blocked with 2% Tween 20, equilibrated in TST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 9.0), and then incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibody, polyclonal antidenatured PAPP-A/proMBP (36Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), diluted in TST containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Blots were washed in TST, further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (P217, DAKO) diluted in TST, and then washed again with TST. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and images were captured with a Kodak Image Station 1000 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Molecular weights were estimated using a prestained marker, Precision Plus protein standard (Bio-Rad).Measurement of Proteolytic Activity—The proteolytic activity of wild-type PAPP-A and PAPP-A mutants was assessed by incubating appropriately diluted culture medium with purified, 125I-labeled natural substrates IGFBP-4 and -5. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were separated by nonreducing 10–20% SDS-PAGE, and cleavage was visualized by autoradiography. Briefly, reactions (total volume of 20 μl) were carried out in STC (100 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) at an enzyme:substrate molar ratio of 1:200 (0.03 nm enzyme, 6 nm substrate). The reaction mixtures contained 0.2 ng of PAPP-A (1 μl of PAPP-A or PAPP-A mutant containing supernatant diluted about 50× in STC according to the level of expression measured by ELISA) and 40.000 cpm of the binding proteins (∼4 ng contained in 2 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). Reactions were carried out in the presence (IGFBP-4) or absence (IGFBP-5) of 20 nm IGF-II (Bachem) diluted in STC from a stock solution of 20 μm in 1 mm HCl, and the reverse experiments were carried out as controls. Following incubation at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and mixed with denaturing sample buffer for gel electrophoresis. For the comparison of wild-type PAPP-A with PAPP-A mutants, conditions were chosen that resulted in ∼50% cleavage of the IGFBP substrate (2 h of incubation). For quantitative measurements (14Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the degree of cleavage in each reaction was determined by measuring band intensities with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The activities of mutants were expressed as the amount of product generated relative to product generated by wild-type PAPP-A at <50% cleavage. Assays in which the effect of Ca2+ was investigated were carried out in distilled (3×) water. Some assays were carried out in the presence of EDTA, EGTA, or calcium-free bovine calbindin D9k (38Johansson C. Brodin P. Grundstrom T. Thulin E. Forsen S. Drakenberg T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As judged by SDS-PAGE and compositional amino acid analysis, the preparation of calbindin was >95% pure.RESULTSThe C-terminal Domain of PAPP-A Is Required for Proteolysis of IGFBP-4 but Not for Proteolysis of IGFBP-5—To investigate the role of PAPP-A domains outside the proteolytic domain, PAPP-A truncation mutants (Fig. 1C) were expressed in 293T cells. The sites of truncation were chosen in accordance with the known pattern of disulfide bonds (19Overgaard M.T. Sorensen E.S. Stachowiak D. Boldt H.B. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2106-2117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) to avoid disulfide-based polymerization. Mutants truncated immediately after the proteolytic domain (PA1–585) or immediately after M1 (PA1–852) did not express at measurable levels, but mutants truncated at or after residue 950 expressed at the level of wild-type PAPP-A (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2The C-terminal region of PAPP-A is required for proteolysis of IGFBP-4 but not for proteolysis of IGFBP-5. A, Western blot of wild-type and truncated PAPP-A mutants. Culture media from transfected 293T cells were separated by nonreducing 10–20% SDS-PAGE and analyzed using antibodies against PAPP-A. Cells were transfected with empty vector (control), cDNA encoding wild-type PAPP-A (PAPP-A wt), and cDNA encoding PAPP-A mutants PA1–585 (W586stop), PA1–852 (E853stop), PA1–950 (H951stop), PA1–1129 (C1130stop), and PA1–1477 (C1478stop) as indicated. Mutants PA1–585 and PA1–852 were undetectable in ELISA. B, cleavage analysis of IGFBP-4 (upper gel) and IGFBP-5 (lower gel), both natural substrates of PAPP-A. Wild-type PAPP-A or PAPP-A mutants were incubated (2 h at 37 °C) with 125I-labeled substrate (1:200). Intact substrate (approximately 30 and 35 kDa, respectively) and co-migrating cleavage products (approximately 15 and 20 kDa, respectively) were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of intact and cleaved IGFBP-4 and -5 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)None of the expressed mutants were capable of cleaving IGFBP-4 under conditions where wild-type PAPP-A cleaved >50% of the substrate (Fig. 2B). However, the truncated proteins all showed wild type-like activity against IGFBP-5, indicating that the core of the proteolytic domain in the truncated proteins is intact and not compromised by incomplete folding.Each of the Three LNR Modules of PAPP-A Is Critical for Proteolysis of IGFBP-4 —Our findings suggest that residues of the 70-residue C-terminal domain, including LNR3, participate in the regulation of PAPP-A proteolytic activity, although these residues are separated from the proteolytic domain by ∼900 residues in the primary structure. We then expressed a series of LNR deletion mutants and a mutant truncated immediately after LNR3 (PA1–1503). As the disulfide connectivity within the C-terminal domain is not completely resolved (19Overgaard M.T. Sorensen E.S. Stachowiak D. Boldt H.B. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2106-2117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the existence of a disulfide bond between LNR3 and the remaining C-terminal 44 residues. However, all mutants of this series expressed at the level of wild-type PAPP-A and migrated in SDS-PAGE as dimers, close to the wild-type protein at 400 kDa (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3IGFBP-4 proteolytic activity of PAPP-A depends on each of LNR modules 1, 2, and 3. A, PAPP-A Western blot of culture medium from 293T cells transfected with empty vector (control), cDNA encoding wild-type PAPP-A (PAPP-A wt), and cDNA encoding PAPP-A mutants dLNR1 (d[Cys334–Cys360]), dLNR2 (d[Ala367–Cys393]), dLNR1–2 (d[Cys334–Cys393]), dLNR3 (d[Cys1478–Cys1503]), and PA1–1503 (Cys1504stop) as indicated. B, proteolytic activity against IGFBP-4 (upper gel) and IGFBP-5 (lower gel) assessed using 125I-labeled substrates followed by autoradiography (see Fig. 2 for further details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All of the mutants lacked detectable activity against IGFBP-4 but were active against IGFBP-5 (Fig. 3B). This immediately suggests that LNR1 and LNR2 are also critical for the regulation of proteolytic activity against IGFBP-4. Compared with wild-type PAPP-A, the IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity of some mutants, in particular dLNR1, was partially impaired. This may be because of a general conformational effect of deleting only one of the two modules inserted between putative β-strands 2 and 3 of the proteolytic domain (14Boldt H.B. Overgaard M.T. Laursen L.S. Weyer K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Oxvig C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In accordance with this interpretation, dLNR1–2, in which the entire inserted sequence is removed, shows less reduction in activity against IGFBP-5 than both dLNR1 and dLNR2.Mutants dLNR3 and PA1–1503 both lacked activity against IGFBP-4 and thus did not allow a functional discrimination between LNR3 and the remaining C-terminal 44 residues; both sequence elements may be important for the proteolysis of IGFBP-4. Alternatively, the folding and/or correct disulfide bond formation of LNR3 may depend on the remaining residues, as indicated above.Mutation of LNR Residues Predicted to Bind Calcium—The above results prompted us to hypothesize that PAPP-A LNR1, -2, and -3 function in a manner similar to one another, possibly forming a single functional unit, although the three modules are not located next to each other in the sequence.An alignment of the PAPP-A LNR modules with LNR modules from a representative member of the Notch receptor family, human Notch1, revealed that in addition to cysteines, some residues with acidic or amide side chains appeared to be highly conserved between the two groups of LNRs (Fig. 4A). Within the entire Notch family, three positions in particular are conserved (marked with bullets in Fig. 4A) (29Aster J.C. Simms W.B. Zavala-Ruiz Z. Patriub V. North C.L. Blacklow S.C.

While the mechanisms of substrate selection have been studied in single-subunit DNA and RNA polymerases (DNAPs and RNAPs, respectively), the determinants of substrate binding in the multisubunit RNAPs are not yet known. Molecular modeling of Thermus thermophilus RNAP-substrate NTP complex identified a conserved β′ subunit Asn737 residue in the active site that could play an essential role in selection of the substrate ribose. We utilized the Escherichia coli RNAP model system to assess this prediction. Functional in vitro analysis demonstrates that the substitutions of the corresponding β′ Asn458 residue lead to the loss of discrimination between ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide substrates as well as to defects in RNA chain extension. Thus, in contrast to the mechanism utilized by the single-subunit T7 RNAP where substrate selection commences in the inactive pre-insertion site prior to its delivery to the catalytic center, the bacterial RNAPs likely recognize the sugar moiety in the active (insertion) site.

Copying (replication) and read-out (transcription) of genetic information contained within cellular genomes are carried out by an array of DNAPs 1The abbreviations used are: DNAP, DNA polymerase; RNAP, RNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide; TEC, transcription elongation complex; WT, wild-type; NAIM, nucleotide analogs interference mapping.1The abbreviations used are: DNAP, DNA polymerase; RNAP, RNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide; TEC, transcription elongation complex; WT, wild-type; NAIM, nucleotide analogs interference mapping. and RNAPs, respectively. These enzymes operate within the same compartment, accessed by both types of substrates, r- and dNTPs, and control their fidelity at both co- and post-synthetic steps to avoid the so-called “error catastrophe,” when the amount of mistakes exceeds redundancy of the system. The first mechanism relies on the discrimination against the “wrong” nucleotide, whereas the second mechanism is invoked after the incorporation of a mismatched nucleotide. The initial selection of the cognate substrate is comprised of two parts: the selection of the nucleotide complementary to the template DNA base and the selection of the correct sugar. The mechanism for sugar selection has been extensively studied in several DNAPs and in the single-subunit T7 RNAP. DNAPs actively discriminate against the rNTP via a “steric gate” formed by the Glu and Phe side chains (1Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In single-subunit T7 RNAP, Tyr639 hydroxyl has been implicated in the positive selection of the ribose via formation of a hydrogen with the 2′-OH group (6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast to DNAPs, T7 RNAP commences the substrate selection in the inactive “open” conformation, while the substrate and the Tyr639 side chain are located in the so called preinsertion site far away from the catalytic center (9Yin Y.W.

This conclusion is consistent with the mutational analysis of T7 RNAP where amino acid changes that affect transcription fidelity cluster around the pre-insertion site (6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Brieba L.G. Sousa R.

By contrast, no mutations affecting the fidelity or sugar discrimination by multisubunit RNAPs have been characterized. Single- and multisubunit RNAPs possess no sequence or apparent structural similarity yet carry out the transcription cycle in a nearly identical manner and could utilize analogous structural elements during catalysis (12Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

These similarities suggest that the basic substrate selection mechanism might also be conserved and that a residue analogous to the Tyr639 would play a critical role in maintaining the ribose specificity in multisubunit RNAPs. However, modeling of the substrate NTP bound to the Thermus thermophilus RNAP active site (15Artsimovitch I. Patlan V. Sekine S. Vassylyeva M.N. Hosaka T. Ochi K. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G.

Thus, Asn458 is likely not a structural analog of Tyr639, as the latter initially recognizes the ribose in the pre-insertion site. To evaluate the role of β′ Asn458 in substrate selection by a bacterial RNAP, we prepared and tested the conservative substitutions of this residue for their effects on utilization of the non-cognate substrates by the E. coli RNAP. Here we demonstrate that, in accordance with the structural predictions, these substitutions lead to a loss of discrimination of sugar moiety. In Vitro Transcription Reactions—The wild-type and altered RNAPs were expressed in pIA299 background and purified as described previously. All templates for transcription reactions were generated by PCR amplification. To form halted transcription elongation complexes (TECs), linear DNA template (40 nm), RNAP (50 nm), ApU (100 μm), and starting NTPs (2.5 μm ATP and GTP, 1 μm CTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol)) were mixed on ice in 50 μl of TGA buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 20 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5% glycerol, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and purified from nucleotides by gel filtration through G50 spin columns (GE Health) equilibrated in TGA buffer. Transcription was restarted by addition of substrates indicated in figure legends, and samples were removed at selected times and quenched by the addition of an equal volume of STOP buffer (10 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3). Experimental Set-up—To determine whether β′ Asn458 residue is critical for the interaction with the 2′-OH, we changed Asn458 to Asp and Ser; these are the conservative changes that would not be expected to substantially alter the structure of the protein but would change either the chemical properties (Asp) or the size (Ser) of the discriminating Asn side chain. The altered enzymes were overexpressed from a polycistronic vector that allows assembly of the core α2ββ′ RNAP in vivo (19Artsimovitch I. Svetlov V. Murakami K.S. Landick R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12344-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), purified, and tested for the ability to discriminate between the cognate and non-cognate substrates. Similarly purified wild-type (WT) RNAP was used as a control. We assembled TECs on pIA349 template that encodes a T7A1 promoter (21Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Cell. 2002; 109: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On this template, TECs can be initially halted at position 37 by withholding UTP from the reaction mix (Fig. 2A), purified by gel filtration to remove the unincorporated substrates and then “walked” to the next template position during addition of a subset of NTPs. We used a similar approach to measure rC/dC selectivity using pIA171 template (20Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) instead. Substitution of Asn458 Leads to Increased dNTP Utilization—We formed a halted TEC on an appropriate template and tested extension of 32P-labeled RNA upon addition of different unlabeled substrates. For each r/dNTP pair assayed, selected substrate was added to a concentration ranging between 0.1–62.5 μm for NTPs and 2–1250 μm for dNTPs, reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C and quenched with STOP buffer (Fig. 2B). The WT RNAP exhibits strong preference toward rNTP substrates, while in the N458D variant these preferences are relaxed. For example, a 2-min incubation with 0.1 μm rGTP led to efficient extension of the nascent RNA by the WT RNAP, whereas an ∼100-fold higher concentration of dGTP was required to achieve the same degree of extension. For the purpose of quantitative comparison we selected the ratio between concentrations of dNTP and rNTP, when half of the transcripts are extended by one nucleotide, as the discrimination quotient. The selectivity of incorporation of different r/dNTP pairs by WT RNAP ranges from 120- to 1200-fold (Fig. 2C) suggesting that the substrate selection depends not only on the identity of the sugar moiety but also on the base structure, even when the Watson-Crick base pairing is maintained. Similar variations have been reported for T7 RNAP (6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and DNAP I (2Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). As expected, substitution of Asn458 for Asp led to substantially relaxed sugar discrimination ranging from 4.8-fold loss of discrimination for rG/dG pair to 26-fold loss in the case of the rU/dT pair. Substitution of Asn458 for Ser led to a smaller loss of preference for the ribose, whereas substitution of an adjacent Tyr457 residue did not alter sugar selection (Fig. 2C). The maximal observed effect for N458D RNAP was somewhat less than that reported for the T7 Y639F RNAP (6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); the base-specific order of r/dNTP selectivity was also different between the bacterial and T7 enzymes (Fig. 2C and Ref. 6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The direct comparison of these data is not straightforward, however, as we have used pre-steady state assays of substrate incorporation by the TEC, whereas Sousa and co-workers (6Huang Y. Eckstein F. Padilla R. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8231-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Sousa R. Padilla R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4609-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) used multiround assays that include both the initiation and elongation steps, which resulted in different discrimination efficiencies for the same RNAP depending on the assay design. In T7 RNAP Tyr to Phe substitution likely completely disrupts polar discriminative interactions with the substrate ribose, whereas Asn for Asp and Ser substitutions in the bacterial enzyme might still maintain specific hydrogen bonding with rNTP sugar moiety. In addition, Asn458 might be not the only residue participating in the ribose recognition in the active site. Indeed, according to the modeling guanidinium group of a highly conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes β′ Arg425 appears proximal to the substrate sugar (Fig. 1B). The experiments are now under way to test the role of β′ Arg425 in substrate selection. Molecular modeling of the multisubunit enzyme pre-insertion site (10Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) suggested that E. coli β′ Thr790 residue could play a role in ribose selection analogous to that of the T7 Tyr639 residue. However, the T790V RNAP not only did not loose preference for rNTP substrates, it actually exhibited more stringency in substrate selection relative to the WT, ranging from 1.1-fold effect in case of rC/dC to 4.8-fold effect for rU/dT (Fig. 2C). These data underscore the importance of the Thr790 residue in substrate selection but argue against involvement of its hydroxyl group in positive selection of the substrate ribose; less conservative substitutions of Thr to Ala and Leu led to gross defects in catalysis (data not shown). A greater loss of discrimination upon the Asn to Asp substitution suggests that charge distribution on the discriminating protein group is more important than the side chain size. In the absence of the experimental crystallographic data on the RNAP-substrate complex structure, we propose a model that is certainly too tentative to predict the exact scheme of the hydrogen-bonding with the substrate but nonetheless allows to zero in on the three protein groups that likely interact with the substrate ribose: Asn458 side chain, Asn458 main chain carbonyl oxygen, and Arg425 guanidinium group. In the high resolution crystal structure of the T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme (17Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) these three groups form an internal hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the main chain conformation of Asn458 does not fall in the most favorable region on the Ramachandran plot (ϕ = –68°; ψ = 77°). The stabilization of this unfavorable conformation likely comes from the hydrogen-bonding of the Asn458 main chain carbonyl with Arg425 and with its own side chain (Fig. 1B). The latter interaction would prevent flipping of the Asn458 side chain amido group that might be crucial for the proper sensing of the substrate ribose. This network of interaction would be enhanced upon binding of the rNTP substrate. In the model, Arg425 as well as the main chain carbonyl oxygen and the side chain amide of Asn458 make contacts with the 3′-OH group, whereas the Asn458 side chain oxygen likely recognizes 2′-OH group of the substrate ribose. The modeling of N458S substitution showed that although the interactions with the sugar would be weakened due to the smaller size of the Ser side chain, its hydroxyl group may preserve the framework of protein-protein and protein-substrate contacts similar to that of Asn (data not shown). In contrast, the negatively charged Asp side chain would lack the interactions with the main chain carbonyl potentially affecting both the main chain and side chain conformations and thus distorting the optimal orientation of the discriminating residue. In addition, the acidic Asp458 side chain might also form a salt bridge with the adjacent Arg425 that would further perturb the Asp interactions with the substrate ribose. Substitution of Asn458 Leads to Profound Defects in Transcript Elongation—RNAP variants with altered substrate selection properties could be used to determine the contribution of individual transcript bases to recognition of regulatory signals. This approach is particularly important for the functional analysis of transient kinetic intermediates, such as those occurring during transcription termination and relies on the ability of nucleotide analogs to affect RNAP response to a particular signal (nucleotide analogs interference mapping (NAIM)). This analysis requires that RNAP is able to incorporate substrate analogs bearing modifications at various positions (22Schwartz A. Rahmouni A.R. Boudvillain M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) but does not have defects in recognition of the transcription signals intended for study. We studied the elongation properties of the N458D RNAP on pIA349 template that encodes several well characterized pause sites (Fig. 3). We found that N458D substitution confers a strong elongation defect; the rate of transcription elongation was dramatically reduced (more than 20-fold), and the enzyme paused strongly early in the transcribed sequence. We conclude that N458D RNAP, albeit able to efficiently incorporate dNTPs into the nascent RNA, is not suitable for NAIM due to its profound elongation defects. N458S RNAP also displayed a reduced elongation rate, but the defect was less pronounced (5-fold; Fig. 3 and data not shown). These results are also in a good agreement with our modeling. In the RNAP holoenzyme structure β′ Arg425 makes strong hydrogen bonds with β′ Asp464 from the catalytic triad. We presume that these interactions are crucial for the proper positioning of the Asp464 side chain that is likely required to optimize the coordination of the major catalytic Mg2+ ion (cMg1, Fig. 1B). In N458D enzyme side chains of Arg425 and Asp458 may form a salt bridge (see above), thereby disrupting functionally important Arg425/Asp464 contacts and subsequently violating proper Mg2+ coordination and compromising catalysis. Consistently, the smaller polar Ser residue would not affect strongly the orientation of the Arg425 side chain and would not exhibit dramatic effect on catalysis. Asn458 is located on the catalytic loop next to the active site. Thus the alternative possible explanation of the observed alterations in the substrate selection and catalysis exhibited by the mutant enzymes would be allosteric effects on the active site configuration. However, substitutions of an adjacent Tyr457 residue for His or Val did not confer either altered substrate selection or defects in transcription elongation (Fig. 2C and data not shown). The major conclusion of this work is that the β′ Asn458 residue in the E. coli RNAP provides the recognition of sugar moiety on the incoming NTP substrate. No significant changes in misincorporation of non-templated NTP substrates arose from Asn458 substitutions (see supplemental data), indicating that the determinants for the sugar and base selection are non-overlapping, as was observed for the single-subunit T7 RNAP (11Huang J. Brieba L.G. Sousa R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11571-11580Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The proposed ribose selection mechanism would also be likely valid for eukaryotic RNAPs that contain a highly conserved counterpart of β′ Asn458; indeed this role for the corresponding Asn479 residue in Rpb1 had been proposed earlier (14Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). For both T7 and E. coli RNAPs the selectivity is far below the values reported for the DNAPs that exclude the rNTP substrates with several thousand- to a million-fold efficiency (1Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1619-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These differences could be explained by the fact that the levels of rNTPs are at least 10-fold higher in the cell than the levels of the corresponding dNTPs (25Uptain S. Kane C. Chamberlin M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, to prevent incorporation of rNTPs DNAPs must impose the strict discrimination mechanism, which is achieved by the steric exclusion of the ribose 2′-hydroxyl. On the other hand, RNAPs might face the opposite problem: the relatively inefficient (e.g. via a single H bond) discrimination between r- and dNTPs could result not only in the synthesis of compromised messages but also in “draining” of the dNTPs pool. Cellular RNAPs would be expected to evolve tighter control mechanisms as compared with the phage ones, since at the time phage RNAP becomes engaged in transcription the host cell is usually moribund. In DNAPs, the substrate recognition is thought to occur exclusively in the insertion site (23Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the T7 TECs substrate can be bound in either the pre-insertion or in the insertion sites located 10 Å apart, suggesting that RNAPs may select substrates in two rather than in a single site (9Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2004; 116: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 10Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The presence of a pre-insertion site in which the substrate can be “sampled” prior to catalysis was also proposed recently for multisubunit RNAPs (10Temiakov D. Patlan V. Anikin M. McAllister W.T. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35597-35608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our present data on Asn458, which is adjacent to the active site, suggest that in bacterial RNAPs substrate selection, at least in part the rNTP/dNTP selection, occurs in the insertion site. Thus the sugar selection may principally occur in the pre-insertion site in T7 but in the insertion site in bacterial RNAPs. If discrimination in favor of rNTP binding were to occur predominantly in the insertion site, persistence of these interactions after catalysis might hinder the movement of the incorporated nucleotide from the n to the n–1 site, thereby slowing translocation and the rate of polymerization. In T7 RNAP, where the pre-insertion site binding seems to be preferable, the Tyr639-2′-OH contact might be compromised during the transition to the closed form. This might explain a faster rate of T7 RNAP transcription as compared with the multisubunit cellular enzymes (25Uptain S. Kane C. Chamberlin M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 117-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). One cannot, however, rule out the possibility that rNTP/dNTP discrimination occurs both in pre-insertion and insertion sites by the different sets of residues. Indeed, substitution of the E. coli β′ Thr790 that is located in the bridge helix and likely belongs to the putative pre-insertion site for Val not only did not decrease the enzyme preference for the ribose but instead increased discrimination up to ∼5-fold (Fig. 2C), implying the direct interactions of β′ Thr790 (or an adjacent) residue with the substrate. Since β′ Thr790 is located 18 Å away from the active (insertion) site and ∼8 Å from the modeled substrate ribose, this result provides strong support to the hypothesis of existence of the substrate pre-insertion site in multisubunit RNAPs. It is therefore possible that some other residue from the pre-insertion site may play a ribose discriminating role similar to that of Asn458 in the insertion site. Alternatively, upon the substrate binding to the insertion site the structural elements that we are now assigning to the pre-insertion site might move toward the RNAP active center to constitute a single closed insertion site. We are currently dissecting the roles of residues in the pre-insertion site of the bacterial RNAP in selection of sugar and the base moieties of the incoming substrate.

We have shown that the kinetics of Thr196 phosphorylation of CaM-KIV by CaM-KK is well correlated with the generation of its autonomous activity, although Thr177 phosphorylation of CaM-KI does not induce its autonomous activity. The activities of CaM-KI chimera mutants fused with C-terminal regions (residues 296–469 and 296–350) of CaM-KIV are completely dependent on Ca2+/CaM, which is also the case for CaM-KI. Unlike wild-type CaM-KI, however, phosphorylation of Thr177 in the chimera mutants by CaM-KK resulted in generation of significant autonomous activities, indicating that the phosphorylation of Thr in the activation loop is sufficient to partially release the autoinhibitory region of CaM-KIV from the catalytic core. Indeed, the CaM-KIV peptide (residues 304–325) containing minimum autoinhibitory sequences (residues 314–321) suppressed the activity of non-phosphorylated CaM-KIV with an IC50 of ∼50 μm, and this suppression was competitive with respect to the peptide substrate; however, the CaM-KIV peptide was not capable of inhibiting Thr196-phosphorylated CaM-KIV. Taken together, these results indicated that the Thr196 phosphorylation of CaM-KIV by CaM-KK reduced the interaction of the catalytic core with the autoinhibitory region, resulting in generation of the autonomous activity.

Phosphorylation of Thr196 in CaM-KIV results in the induction of a large amount of Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity. In addition to the induction of total activity, Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (autonomous activity) is generated by activation with CaM-KK. This important regulatory mechanism would allow a transient elevation in intracellular Ca2+ levels to produce a prolonged CaM-KIV activation to regulate gene transcription via the phosphorylation of transcription factor(s). Autonomous activity of CaM-KIV has been observed with purified enzyme from rat brain (20Frangakis M.V. Ohmstede C.A. Sahyoun N. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15813-15818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that the autonomous activity appears to be required for CaM-KIV to regulate CREB-mediated transcription, indicating that it might be physiologically relevant (25Anderson K.A. Noeldner P.K. Reece K. Wadzinski B.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31708-31716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have shown that the induction of the total activity of CaM-KIV by CaM-KK phosphorylation was because of mainly decreasing Km for its substrate (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not account for generation of the autonomous activity. At a minimum, Thr196 phosphorylation by CaM-KK is required for generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of CaM-KIV, because a mutation of Thr196 by Ala has been shown to abolish the generation of autonomous activity (19Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A.

Therefore, it has not been resolved whether the Ca2+-independent activity is a direct consequence of Thr196 phosphorylation or whether it is the result of subsequent autophosphorylation. In contrast, it has been well characterized that CaM-KII, another member of multifunctional CaM-Ks, is converted to the Ca2+/CaM-independent form by autophosphorylation at Thr286 in its autoinhibitory region, which suppresses the autoinhibitory function of the enzyme (26Lou L.L.

Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Although there is an equivalent Thr (Thr308) in the putative autoinhibitory region of CaM-KIV, mutation of Thr308 to Ala did not impair the generation of autonomous activity, indicating that the Thr308 is not involved in the generation of autonomous activity (23Tokumitsu H.

In addition, multiple autophosphorylation sites have been identified in either the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain or the C-terminal region of CaM-KIV (36McDonald O.B. Merrill B.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus the precise mechanism of the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV generated by CaM-KK phosphorylation remains uncertain. In this report, we have examined the mechanism of generation of the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV by CaM-KK phosphorylation using Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant enzymes, including CaM-KI/CaM-KIV chimera mutants and the autoinhibitory peptide of CaM-KIV, and demonstrated that Thr196 phosphorylation reduced the affinity of its autoinhibitory region to the catalytic core and is likely sufficient to generate the autonomous activity of the enzyme. Materials—CaM-KKα cDNA (GenBank™ accession number L42810) was obtained from a rat brain cDNA library (18Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Recombinant CaM-KKα was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (39Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat CaM was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) using pET-CaM (kindly provided by Dr. Nobuhiro Hayashi, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, Japan) and purified by phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography (40Hayashi N. Matsubara M. Takasaki A. Titani K. Taniguchi H. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Anti-CaM-KIV antibody and anti-CaM-KI antibody were obtained from Signal Transduction Laboratories and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Anti-phospho-CaM-KIV at Thr196 and anti-phospho-CaM-KI at Thr177 monoclonal antibodies were generated against the synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to residues 189–203 of rat CaM-KIV (CEHQVLMKT(p)VCGTPGY) and corresponding to residues 169–184 of rat CaM-KI (CEDPGSVLST-(p)ACGTPGY), respectively. Peptides were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the N terminus cysteine and were injected into BALB/c mice as described previously (41Kimura K. Nozaki N. Saijo M. Kikuchi A. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24523-24526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated CaM was purchased from Biomedical Technologies Inc. (Stoughton, MA). A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 304–325 of mouse CaM-KIV (VHMDTAQKKLQEFNARRKLKAA) was obtained from Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX) with >95% purity. All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources. Construction and Expression of CaM-KI and CaM-KIV—GST-fused CaM-KI was constructed by amplification of cDNA fragments using rat CaM-KI cDNA as a template, and a sense primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGATGCCAGGGGCAGTGGAAGGC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTCCATGGCCCTAGAGC-3′). GST-fused CaM-KIVs were constructed by amplification of cDNA fragments using mouse CaM-KIV cDNA (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template, and a sense primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGATGCTCAAAGTCACGGTGCCC-3′) and the following antisense primers: wild-type, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGTACTCTGGCTGAATCGC-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–350), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTGTGGTTCTCTTGGAT-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–336), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATCCCAGCCGAGAAGAGGC-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–331), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGGCCACCACAGCCTTCAC-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–327), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTCACCGCTGCCTTAAG-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–321), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACTTGCGCCGAGCATTG-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–313), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAAGTTTCTTCTGAGCAG-3′; CaM-KIV-(1–309), 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAAGCAGTGTCCATGTGAAC-3′. The PCR products were then ligated into the XbaI/XhoI site of the pGEX-PreS vector (39Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GST-fused CaM-KI/IV469 and CaM-KI/IV350 were constructed by replacement of the StuI/XhoI-digested fragment of the wild-type pGEX-PreS-CaM-KI by a PCR fragment amplified using mouse CaM-KIV cDNA as a template, and sense (5′-CCTTGCAGCACCCATGGGTCACAGGTAAAG-3′) and antisense primers (wild-type and CaM-KIV-(1–350), respectively) as described above. The nucleotide sequences of CaM-KIV mutants and CaMKI/KIV chimera mutants, including the wild-type enzymes, were confirmed by an ABI377 automated sequencer. cDNAs carrying GST-fused enzymes were introduced into E. coli JM-109, and the expression of recombinant enzyme was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Purification of Recombinant Enzymes—An E. coli pellet containing recombinant enzyme was lysed with PBS followed by purification using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Then further purification was carried out by using CaM-Sepharose column chromatography as described in the manufacturer's protocol for the enzymes that are capable of binding Ca2+/CaM (wild-type CaM-KI, CaM-KIV, CaM-KI/IV469, CaM-KI/IV350, CaM-KIV-(1–350), and CaM-KIV-(1–336)). These enzymes were eluted from the column with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA (Buffer A). Recombinant enzymes which do not bind Ca2+/CaM (CaM-KIV-(1–331), -(1–327), -(1–321), -(1–313), and -(1–309)) were dialyzed against Buffer A. Then purified enzymes were digested with PreScission protease (10 unit, Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h at 5 °C to cleave GST followed by purification using glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Pass-through fractions from the column were collected and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). After addition of equal volumes of 80% glycerol and 20% ethylene glycol solution, purified enzymes were stored at –30 °C. In Vitro Activation of CaM-KI and CaM-KIV by CaM-KK—Purified recombinant CaM-Ks (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with CaM-KKα (3 μg/ml) at 30 °C for the indicated periods in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 μm CaM, and 200 μm ATP. The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP and terminated by 10–20-fold dilution with ice-cold 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% ethylene glycol, and 2 mm EDTA. Five μl of the diluted sample was then subjected to the protein kinase assay or Western blot analysis. In Vitro Assay for CaM-KI and CaM-KIV Activity—CaM-KI and CaM-KIV were assayed at 30 °C for 5–10 min in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 40 μm syntide-2, 1 mm DTT, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA (autonomous activity) or 1 mm CaCl2, 4 μm CaM. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and terminated by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81) followed by several washes with 75 mm phosphoric acid (42Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Phosphate incorporation into syntide-2 was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. Others—Western blotting was performed as described previously using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-goat IgG antibody as a secondary antibody and chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection. CaM overlay was carried out using biotinylated CaM (0.5 μg/ml) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 as described previously (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection. Protein concentration was estimated by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217315) Google Scholar). Activation and Phosphorylation of CaM-KIV and CaM-KI by CaM-KK—It has been shown that CaM-KIV is phosphorylated at Thr196 by CaM-KK, resulting in induction of a high level of Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity as well as generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (17Tokumitsu H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Because CaM-KIV undergoes autophosphorylation of multiple residues subsequent to activation (36McDonald O.B. Merrill B.M. Bland M.M. Taylor L.C. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10054-10059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1995; 117: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the relationship between activation of the kinase activity and Thr196 phosphorylation has not been precisely determined in vitro. Therefore, we have attempted to perform time course experiments on CaM-KIV activation and phosphorylation of Thr196 using anti-phospho-Thr196 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). We have expressed GST-fused enzymes and then GST was cleaved by PreScission protease treatment followed by removing GST and GST-fused protease to avoid the effect of GST on the enzyme activities and regulation. Thus the recombinant enzymes used in this study contain five residues (Gly-Pro-Ile-Leu-Glu) fused with the first Met. As shown in Fig. 1A, both Ca2+/CaM-dependent and -independent activities (∼30% of total activity) of CaM-KIV were induced by CaM-KK treatment in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and Mg-ATP and were saturated for 20 min. This activation kinetics was well correlated with Thr196 phosphorylation under this condition (t½ = ∼5 min, Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that we did not observe a significant time lag between generation of the autonomous activity and phosphorylation of Thr196. These characteristic features of the recombinant CaM-KIV used in this study, including generation of autonomous activity by activation and kinetic parameters of the enzyme (Km for ATP = 27 μm and Km for syntide-2 = 264 μm, Fig. 5C), were similar to the previous results obtained using enzymes expressed in Sf9 cells (16Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17616-17621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We also performed similar experiments using CaM-KI and the same concentration (3 μg/ml) of CaM-KK as used for CaM-KIV activation (Fig. 1C). Protein kinase activity assay and Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Thr177 monoclonal antibody revealed that, in comparison to CaM-KIV, CaM-KI was more rapidly activated and phosphorylated at Thr177 by CaM-KK (t½ = <1 min) than CaM-KIV. However, significant autonomous activity of CaM-KI was not observed during the activation. These results indicated that the autoinhibitory mechanisms might differ between CaM-KIV and CaM-KI, at least for the phosphorylated form of enzymes, which in turn might affect the generation of the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV.Fig. 5Inhibition of CaM-KIV activity by CaM-KIV autoinhibitory peptide (residues 304–325).A, wild-type CaM-KIV was either treated with CaM-KK at 30 °C for 30 min as described in Fig. 1A (+) or left untreated (–), and then the enzymes (40 ng) were subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-CaM-KIV antibody (upper panel), anti-phospho-Thr196 antibody (middle panel), or CaM overlay analysis in the presence of Ca2+ (lower panel). B, protein kinase activities of either the CaM-KK-treated (closed circle, 2 μg/ml) or untreated CaM-KIV wild-type (open circle, 2 μg/ml) were measured with various concentrations of the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 304–325 of CaM-KIV (0–250 μm) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl, 4 μm CaM at 30 °C for 5 min (closed circle) or 10 min (open circle). 2Activities are expressed as a percentage of the value in the absence of the peptide. Results represent the duplicate experiments. C, kinetic analysis of CaM-KIV inhibition. CaM-KIV was assayed in either the presence (closed circle) or absence (open circle) of 100 μm CaM-KIV peptide (residues 304–325) as described in panel B except for concentrations of substrates. For titration of syntide-2 (left panel), 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 50–400 μm syntide-2 were used. For titration of ATP (right panel), 400 μm syntide-2 and 25–200 μm [γ-32P]ATP were used. The results were performed in duplicate for each point and are presented as double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Characterization of CaM-KI/CaM-KIV Chimera Mutants— To examine the role of the autoinhibitory mechanism of CaM-KIV in the generation of autonomous activity, we have constructed, expressed, and purified chimera mutants in which the CaM-KI catalytic domain was fused with various C-terminal portions of CaM-KIV (residues 296–469 and residues 296–350; Fig. 2, A and B, upper panel), because it has been shown that CaM-KI does not undergo autophosphorylation in the catalytic domain subsequent to the activation (44Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and also does not generate autonomous activity in association with Thr177 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). CaM-overlay analysis revealed that the chimera mutants possess the same degree of functional Ca2+/CaM binding ability as the wild-type CaM-KI (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Without activation by CaM-KK, CaM-KI/CaM-KIV469 and CaM-KI/CaM-KIV350 were inactive in the absence of Ca2+/CaM and exhibited kinase activity only in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, which results are indistinguishable from those for the wild-type CaM-KI (Fig. 2C). This indicates that the autoinhibitory region in the C-terminal of CaM-KIV (within residues 296–350) functionally suppresses the catalytic activity of CaM-KI, which is conformationally neutralized by Ca2+/CaM binding. When we treated these CaM-KI chimera mutants with CaM-KK in the presence of Ca2+/CaM and Mg-ATP for 5 min as described in Fig. 1C, both mutants including wild-type CaM-KI were phosphorylated at Thr177 (Fig. 2D, inset). However, unlike wild-type CaM-KI, which does not generate significant autonomous activity (Figs. 1C and 2D), CaM-KI/CaM-KIV469 and CaM-KI/CaM-KIV350 showed a high level of autonomous activity after their activation. This result strongly supports the idea that the autoinhibitory mechanism of CaM-KIV was partially disrupted by phosphorylation of the activation loop Thr residue, thereby resulting in generation of autonomous activity, because it has been shown that CaM-KI is phosphorylated at Thr177 by CaM-KK, but no other autophosphorylation in the catalytic domain has been observed (44Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mapping of the Autoinhibitory Sequence in CaM-KIV—To clarify the involvement of the autoinhibitory function in generation of the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV, we attempted to precisely map the autoinhibitory sequence in CaM-KIV. Previous studies have demonstrated that the truncation at Leu313 (16Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a block mutation (Phe316–Asn317 to Asp–Asp) are converted to the Ca2+/CaM-independent form of CaM-KIV (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal region after Leu313 contains the autoinhibitory sequence of CaM-KIV. Because the precise location of the autoinhibitory sequence has not been determined, we expressed and purified a series of C-terminal truncation mutants to map a minimum autoinhibitory sequence (Fig. 3, A and B, insert upper panel). As shown in Fig. 3B, measurement of the protein kinase activities of these mutants in either the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM revealed that truncation after Gly336 did not alter either the Ca2+/CaM dependence of the activity or the activity itself. The truncation mutants at Ala331, Lys327, and Lys321 are completely inactive in either the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM, indicating that these mutants contain a functional autoinhibitory sequence. Semiquantitative analysis of the Ca2+/CaM binding of these mutants using the CaM overlay method in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3B, insert lower panel) showed that the truncation mutant at Ala331 fails to bind Ca2+/CaM as well as other truncation mutants (1–327, 1–321, 1–313, and 1–309), suggesting that the residues between Ser332 and Gly336 are the C-terminal end of the Ca2+/CaM binding sequence. Thus the 1–331, 1–327, and 1–321 mutants were not activated by Ca2+/CaM. Further truncation at Leu313 generated the constitutively active enzyme to the same degree as did truncation at Ala309, consistent with a previous report (16Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and which suggested that a minimum autoinhibitory sequence is located between Gln314 and Lys321. This is also consistent with our previous observation that double Asp mutations at Phe316 and Asn317 impair the autoinhibitory function of CaM-KIV, resulting in generation of Ca2+/CaM-independent activity (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined whether CaM-KIV-(1–336) generates its autonomous activity by activation, because the mutant lacks the C-terminal portion of CaM-KIV (residues 337–469) but contains the functional regulatory domain, including the autoinhibitory and Ca2+/CaM binding sequences that completely suppress the catalytic activity of CaM-KIV in the absence of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3). During incubation with CaM-KK in the presence of Mg-ATP and Ca2+/CaM, Ca2+/CaM-independent activity was significantly increased in association with the Thr196 phosphorylation (Fig. 4), which was similar to the results for the wild-type CaM-KIV (Fig. 1, A and B). This result indicated that the C-terminal portion of CaM-KIV after Gly336 is unlikely to be involved in the generation of its autonomous activity. Inhibition of CaM-KIV Activity by CaM-KIV Autoinhibitory Peptide—Based on the mapping of the regulatory domain in CaM-KIV (Fig. 3), we were able to synthesize the CaM-KIV peptide (residues 304–325) containing the minimum autoinhibitory sequence (residues 314–321) to examine its inhibition of unphosphorylated and Thr196-phosphorylated CaM-KIV (Fig. 5A, upper and middle panels). We also confirmed by CaM overlay analysis that the Ca2+/CaM bindings of two enzymes were indistinguishable (Fig. 5A, lower panel). In the presence of Ca2+/CaM, the CaM-KIV peptide inhibited the total activity of unphosphorylated CaM-KIV with an IC50 value of ∼50 μm (Fig. 5B), which is ∼3-fold less potent than the inhibition by the CaM-KII autoinhibitory peptide (residues 281–302, T286A) (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of CaM-KIV by the CaM-KIV peptide (residues 304–325) was not competitive with ATP but was competitive with the peptide substrate syntide-2 (Fig. 5C). This kinetic profile of enzyme inhibition was similar to that observed for the inhibition of CaM-KIV by the CaM-KII autoinhibitory peptide (residues 281–302, T286A) (17Tokumitsu H. Brickey D.A. Gold J. Hidaka H. Sikela J. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28640-28647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we assayed the same concentration (2 μg/ml) of phosphorylated CaM-KIV by CaM-KK for 30 min (Fig. 1A), the CaM-KIV peptide at a concentration of up to 250 μm was unable to suppress the activity of activated CaM-KIV (Fig. 5B). We performed the same kinase assay as shown in Fig. 5B in the absence of the peptide substrate (syntide-2), but significant phosphate incorporation into the CaM-KIV peptide was not detected (data not shown). We also confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis that the autoinhibitory peptide was not phosphorylated at Thr308 by activated CaM-KIV (data not shown). This result indicated that the interaction between the catalytic core of CaM-KIV and the autoinhibitory peptide was abolished by Thr196 phosphorylation, resulting in a loss of the inhibitory potency of the peptide. The enzymatic activities of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases are thought to be strictly autoinhibited by intrasteric interaction between their own autoinhibitory segment and the catalytic core when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is low enough to dissociate from CaM. Once the concentration rises upon stimulation of the cells, the Ca2+-CaM complex binds to the Ca2+/CaM binding segment of the kinases, which either overlaps or is adjacent to the autoinhibitory segment. Then Ca2+/CaM binding conformationally neutralize the autoinhibitory function, resulting in the generation of protein kinase activity. Two members of the CaM-K family, CaM-KII and CaM-KIV, generate Ca2+/CaM-independent activity in association with autophosphorylation at Thr286 and trans-phosphorylation at Thr196 by an upstream kinase (CaM-KK), respectively. Here we have shown that the phosphorylation of Thr196 in the activation loop by CaM-KK was likely sufficient to generate the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV because of: 1) the in vitro kinetics of the activation and Thr196 phosphorylation of CaM-KIV were well correlated; 2) CaM-KI chimera mutants containing the regulatory domain of CaM-KIV generated autonomous activities that were associated with Thr177 phosphorylation by CaM-KK, whereas the CaM-KI wild-type did not exhibit Ca2+/CaM-independent activity by Thr177 phosphorylation and also did not undergo autophosphorylation in the catalytic domain subsequent to the activation (44Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); 3) as shown in the experiment with a truncation mutant (CaM-KIV-(1–336)), the C-terminal of CaM-KIV (residues 337–469) is not directly involved in generation of autonomous activity; and 4) CaM-KIV autoinhibitory peptide (residues 304–325) failed to inhibit activated CaM-KIV without phosphorylation by CaM-KIV. Although multiple autophosphorylation sites in the N-terminal region of the catalytic domain of CaM-KIV have been identified (36McDonald O.B. Merrill B.M. Bland M.M. Taylor L.C. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10054-10059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Watanabe S. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1995; 117: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a previous study has shown that the deletion of six N-terminal Ser residues (Ser8, Ser10, Ser12, Ser13, Ser15, and Ser16 in the human enzyme) did not impair the generation of autonomous activity subsequent to the activation by CaM-KK (35Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that the Thr196 phosphorylation is most likely sufficient to generate the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV. However, although it is unlikely, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the autophosphorylation at unidentified residue(s) subsequent to phosphorylation at Thr196 by CaM-KK may be involved in the generation of autonomous activity. Interestingly, CaM-KI is also phosphorylated on Thr177 in the activation loop by CaM-KK, resulting in a large increase in Ca2+/CaM-dependent activity without generation of autonomous activity (45Haribabu B. Hook S.S. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Tomhave E.D. Edelman A.M. Synderman R. Means A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3679-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 46Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This result, together with our present data, suggests that the autoinhibitory mechanisms of CaM-KI and CaM-KIV are distinct, which is supported by the fact that the CaM-KI chimera mutants fused with the regulatory domain of CaM-KIV, generating Ca2+/CaM-independent activity by Thr177 phosphorylation, whereas the CaM-KIV autoinhibitory domain completely suppressed the catalytic activity of unphosphorylated chimera mutants in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. Therefore, the autoinhibitory segment of CaM-KIV no longer tightly binds to the Thr177-phosphorylated CaM-KI catalytic core in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, but that of CaM-KI does. Consistent with these findings, we directly demonstrated that the inhibitory function of the autoinhibitory peptide of CaM-KIV (residues 304–325), by preventing the substrate binding, was completely lost toward phosphorylated CaM-KIV on Thr196. This observation clearly indicates that the autonomous activity of CaM-KIV is generated by a reduction of the interaction between the catalytic core and the autoinhibitory region. Notably, the Ca2+/CaM-independent activity of activated CaM-KIV accounts for ∼30% of the total activity suggesting that the autoinhibitory region is partially but not fully released from the catalytic core. This may indicate that the intramolecular interaction of the catalytic core with the autoinhibitory region is not completely destroyed by Thr196 phosphorylation, as distinct from our results with the intermolecular inhibition by the autoinhibitory peptide. The crystal structure of the autoinhibited form of CaM-KI revealed that the regulatory segment of CaM-KI (residues 286–316) interacted with the catalytic core at some distance from Thr177 (47Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This may account for the finding that the autoinhibitory mechanism of CaM-KI appeared not to be affected by Thr177 phosphorylation. We could therefore speculate that the autoinhibitory domain of CaM-KIV might be located closer to the activation loop in its autoinhibited form of unphosphorylated kinase to prevent the substrate binding. Subsequent to phosphorylation by CaM-KK, the interaction of the autoinhibitory segment with the catalytic core of CaM-KIV could be reduced by either Thr196 phosphorylation directly or by conformational changes of the catalytic domain mediated by Thr196 phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, resulting in the partial release of the autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic core. In contrast to the findings for CaM-KIV, it has been extensively characterized that direct autophosphorylation of the autoinhibitory region at Thr286 in CaM-KII suppresses the autoinhibitory function that is necessary to generate CaM-KII autonomous activity (26Lou L.L.

Therefore, closely related multifunctional CaM-Ks appear to show different modes of regulating the autoinhibitory mechanism in association with the activation. Because the three-dimensional structure of CaM-KIV has not been determined, future structural studies will be needed to clarify the mechanism of the enzymatic regulation of CaM-KIV in greater detail, and to reveal the diverse range of autoinhibitory mechanisms among the CaM-K family.

https://openalex.org/W2100760715,"The essential component of infectious prions is a misfolded protein termed PrPSc, which is produced by conformational change of a normal host protein, PrPC. It is currently unknown whether PrPSc molecules exist in a unique conformation or whether they are able to undergo additional conformational changes. Under commonly used experimental conditions, PrPSc molecules are characteristically protease-resistant and capable of inducing the conversion of PrPC molecules into new PrPSc molecules. We describe the effects of ionic strength, copper, and zinc on the conformation-dependent protease resistance and conversion-inducing activity of PrPSc molecules in scrapie-infected hamster brains. In the absence of divalent cations, PrPSc molecules were >20-fold more sensitive to proteinase K digestion in low ionic strength buffers than in high ionic strength buffers. Addition of micromolar concentrations of copper or zinc ions restored the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules under conditions of low ionic strength. These transition metals also controlled the conformation of purified truncated PrP-(27–30) molecules at low ionic strength, confirming that the N-terminal octapeptide repeat region of PrPSc is not required for binding to copper or zinc ions. The protease-sensitive and protease-resistant conformations of PrPSc were reversibly interchangeable, and only the protease-resistant conformation of PrPSc induced by high ionic strength was able to induce the formation of new protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) molecules in vitro. These findings show that PrPSc molecules are structurally interconvertible and that only a subset of PrPSc conformations are able to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease, and scrapie belong to an unusual group of central nervous system infections called the prion diseases (1Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). Much experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the infectious agents of these diseases contain no informational nucleic acids (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Instead, biochemical studies indicate that prions are composed primarily of a misfolded protein designated PrPSc, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, scrapie prion protein; PrPC, cellular prion protein; PrP, prion protein; PrPres, protease-resistant PrPSc; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. which is able to induce the conformational change of a normal host glycoprotein termed PrPC into new PrPSc molecules through a self-propagating mechanism (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar, 4Caughey B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The conformational state(s) of PrPSc molecules that are able to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules is currently unknown (5Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Nature. 1997; 389: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Purification of infectious prions from scrapie-infected Syrian hamsters revealed that fractions enriched for scrapie infectivity primarily contain PrP molecules relatively resistant to protease digestion (PrPres) (6Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 218: 1309-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). PrPres molecules have been found only in prion-infected cells, so it is possible that PrPres is equivalent to PrPSc. In support of this hypothesis, denaturation of PrPres molecules by various biochemical procedures causes parallel decreases in prion infectivity (7McKinley M.P. Bolton D.C. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 57-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). However, the ratio of PrPres molecules to prion LD50 infectivity units in purified prion preparations has been estimated to be 1:100,000 or less (5Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. Nature. 1997; 389: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that infectious PrPSc molecules compose only a minor fraction of the PrP molecules contained in such preparations. Several studies indirectly support this alternative view. 1) It is possible to denature and refold PrP molecules into protease-resistant forms that are not infectious (8Wille H. Zhang G.F. Baldwin M.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); 2) prion infectivity can be propagated in vivo by inocula lacking detectable PrPres (9Lasmezas C.I. Deslys J.P. Robain O. Jaegly A. Beringue V. Peyrin J.M. Fournier J.G. Hauw J.J. Rossier J. Dormont D. Science. 1997; 275: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar); and 3) conformation-dependent immunoassay experiments show that prion-infected brains contain both protease-sensitive and protease-resistant forms of PrPSc-like molecules (10Safar J. Wille H. Itri V. Groth D. Serban H. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify the conformational state(s) of PrPSc molecules that induce the formation of PrPres molecules in vitro and propagate infectivity in vivo. Another important question is whether PrPSc molecules exist in a unique and static conformation or whether they are capable of undergoing additional conformational changes that would allow them to exist in different states at equilibrium. Three independent observations support the view that PrPSc molecules might have interconvertible structures and that these structures might be controlled by copper or zinc ions. 1) Copper and zinc ions control the strain-dependent electrophoretic mobility of PrPres in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brain homogenates (11Wadsworth J.D. Hill A.F. Joiner S. Jackson G.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar); 2) copper increases the level of PrPres detected in scrapie-infected mouse brain homogenates (12Sigurdsson E.M. Brown D.R. Alim M.A. Scholtzova H. Carp R. Meeker H.C. Prelli F. Frangione B. Wisniewski T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46199-46202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); and 3) copper enhances the reversal of scrapie inactivation by guanidine hydrochloride (13McKenzie D. Bartz J. Mirwald J. Olander D. Marsh R. Aiken J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25545-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the effects of several chemical factors on PrPSc conformation in vitro. Specifically, we tested the influence of monovalent salts and transition metals on the protease resistance and conversion-inducing activity of PrPSc. Our results reveal that ionic strength, copper, and zinc influence the conformation of PrPSc interdependently. In addition, our results indicate that the conversions between different PrPSc conformations are reversible and that the protease-resistant conformation of PrPSc induced by high ionic strength can induce the conversion of other PrP molecules. Preparations of Crude Scrapie-infected Brain Homogenates—Frozen RML-infected Tg(MH2M) mouse brains (kindly provided by Dr. Stanley Prusiner, University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Sc237-infected hamster brains were homogenized separately. Each brain was homogenized in 10 volumes of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in H2O using a disposable tissue grinder. The crude homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s at 200 × g, and aliquots of the supernatant were frozen at -70 °C for subsequent experiments. Membrane Fractionation—P2 membranes were obtained using a modification of a previously described protocol (14Nishina K. Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Six frozen Syrian hamster brains (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) were homogenized in 40 ml of buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose and 5 mm Tris (pH 7.5) plus EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) with 10 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon/glass homogenizer. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was divided evenly into two separate tubes and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellets (P2) were resuspended as follows: one pellet with 15 ml of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) plus EDTA-free Complete® tablets and the other pellet with 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium plus EDTA-free Complete® tablets. The resuspended pellets were then homogenized with a Potter homogenizer using 10 strokes each for both loose and tight pestles. This identical procedure was used to obtain corresponding P2 fractions from 12 Prnp0/0 mouse brains. Aliquots of all fractions were frozen at -70 °C for subsequent experiments. Preparation of PrP-(27–30)—A sample containing 200 μl of 1% (w/v) Sc237 scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate in Buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 1% Triton X-100) was treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 25 °C. Proteolytic digestion was terminated by addition of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science). Following proteinase K digestion, the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with Buffer A and resuspended in 500 μl of the specified test buffers using a Bandolin Sonoplus ultrasonicator (Amtrex Technologies, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) set for 10 1-s pulses. PrPSc Protease Resistance Assay—The protease resistance of PrPSc was assayed using 0.2% (w/v) scrapie-infected brain homogenate in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 0.5% Triton X-100 plus other components as specified in each experiment. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with continuous shaking. Following incubation, samples were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C unless specified otherwise. The samples were then boiled in SDS sample loading buffer for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. In Vitro PrPres Amplification Assay—In vitro PrPres amplification was performed using hamster P2 subfractions as described previously (14Nishina K. Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Samples containing 50 μl of P2 membranes were incubated with 50 μl of 0.1% (w/v) Sc237 scrapie-infected brain homogenate and diluted into the specified test buffers plus 0.5% Triton X-100. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with continuous shaking. Following incubation but prior to proteinase K digestion, 150 mm NaCl was added to samples incubated without salt. All samples were treated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The digested samples were then boiled in SDS sample loading buffer for 10 min prior to electrophoresis. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (14Nishina K. Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE was performed on 1.5-mm 12% acrylamide gels with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 29:1. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to an ethanol-charged, buffer-equilibrated polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Hoeffer TE 50X transfer unit (Amersham Biosciences) set at 1.5 A for 2 h. Transferred membranes were treated with 0.2 n NaOH for 10 min, rinsed 3 × 5 min with TBST (10 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and blocked with 5% Carnation nonfat milk powder in TBST for 1 h. Blocked membranes were incubated with 200 ng/ml monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Signet Laboratories, Inc., Dedham, MA) in TBST overnight at 4 °C, washed 4 × 10 min with TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in TBST for 30 min at 4 °C, and washed again 4 × 10 min with TBST. The blots were developed with ECL reagent (Pierce), sealed in plastic covers, and exposed to Super RX film (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Exposed films were developed automatically in a Kodak M35A X-Omat film processor. Relative molecular masses in kilodaltons, based on the migration of prestained protein standards (Bio-Rad), are indicated to the right of each figure. Chromogenic Protease Assay—Proteinase K activity was measured as described previously for elastase (15Bieth J. Spiess B. Wermuth C.G. Biochem. Med. 1974; 11: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Proteinase K was resuspended in various test buffers at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. The chromogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-AlaAla-p-nitroanilide (Peptides International Inc., Louisville, KY) was added (from a 125 mm stock solution in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (Acros Organics, Somerville, NJ)) to obtain a final concentration of 1 mm succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide. The samples were mixed and incubated at 25 °C. Absorbance measurements of triplicate samples at 410 nm were made at 10-min intervals, and the means ± S.E. were calculated using Microsoft Excel. Ionic Strength and Copper Control the Protease Resistance of PrPSc Molecules—In our first series of experiments, we examined the effects of ionic strength and copper concentration on the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules in crude scrapie-infected brain homogenates. Unexpectedly, we discovered that PrPSc molecules were protease-sensitive when incubated at low ionic strength in the absence of transition metals (Fig. 1, second panel, first lane). The protease resistance of PrPSc molecules was restored by addition of NaCl at concentrations >50 mm (Fig. 1, second panel, second and eleventh through fourteenth lanes). A variety of other salts, including LiCl, NaCl, KCl, NaF, NaBr, and NaI, also restored the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules in scrapie-infected brain homogenates at concentrations >50 mm (data not shown), indicating that the induction of protease resistance requires a minimum level of ionic strength rather than the presence of a particular monovalent salt. Next, we tested the ability of copper ions to restore the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules under conditions of low ionic strength. Fig. 1 (second panel, eighth lane) shows that PrPSc molecules were protease-resistant in the presence of 100 μm CuCl2 under conditions of low ionic strength. In contrast, addition of copper did not increase the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules in the presence of 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, fourth panel). In fact, addition of 100 μm copper decreased the recovery of PrPres under conditions of high ionic strength. Thus, our results indicate that copper ions increase the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules only under conditions of low ionic strength. PrPSc molecules derived from different strain isolates and animal species possess distinct biochemical characteristics. For instance, PrPSc molecules derived from different strains of prions display differential susceptibilities to proteinase K digestion (16Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride denaturation (17Peretz D. Scott M.R. Groth D. Williamson R.A. Burton D.R. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 854-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and polyamidoamine dendrimers (18Supattapone S. Wille H. Uyechi L. Safar J. Tremblay P. Szoka F.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3453-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the effects of ionic strength and copper on the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules are restricted to a particular prion strain or animal species. We found that the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules derived from both RML-infected mouse and Sc237-infected hamster brains was affected by salt and copper in a similar manner (Fig. 1, compare second and third panels). These results indicate that the effects of ionic strength and copper are not limited to PrPSc molecules derived from a particular prion strain or animal species. To quantitate the differences in PrPSc protease resistance observed under various conditions, we performed protease digestion assays using varying amounts of proteinase K. Our results show that PrPSc molecules were >20-fold more sensitive to proteinase K digestion when incubated at low ionic strength and in the absence of copper compared with PrPSc molecules incubated either at high ionic strength or in the presence of copper (Fig. 2A). For comparison, PrPC molecules in normal brain homogenates were ∼100-fold more sensitive to proteinase K digestion than PrPSc molecules incubated at low ionic strength and ∼2000-fold more protease-sensitive than PrPSc molecules incubated at high ionic strength (data not shown). Ionic strength and copper could conceivably control the protease resistance of PrPSc either by changing the conformation of PrPSc molecules or by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of proteinase K in our assays. To test the possibility that proteinase K might be inhibited by salt or copper, we measured proteinase K activity under different buffer conditions using succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide, a non-conformational chromogenic substrate (15Bieth J. Spiess B. Wermuth C.G. Biochem. Med. 1974; 11: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The results show that proteinase K activity was not affected by addition of 150 mm NaCl and was only mildly reduced by addition of 100 μm CuCl2 (Fig. 2B). In addition, we tested whether ionic strength or copper influences the general pattern of protein degradation in brain homogenates digested with varying concentrations of proteinase K and found no significant change (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these control experiments indicate that the effects of ionic strength and copper on the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules cannot be attributed to nonspecific inhibition of proteinase K activity. Therefore, these chemical factors must influence either the tertiary or quaternary conformation of PrPSc molecules directly. Copper and Zinc Ions Specifically Control PrPSc Conformation—Copper is one of several transition metals normally found in physiological fluids. Previous studies showed that recombinant PrP molecules have >1000-fold greater affinity for binding to copper ions than to other metal ions (19Kramer M.L. Kratzin H.D. Schmidt B. Romer A. Windl O.

Waltho J.P. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8531-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and that PrPC molecules bind copper ions in vivo (21Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of the effect of copper on PrPSc conformation, we tested the abilities of various metal salts to induce PrPSc protease resistance at low ionic strength. When tested at a concentration of 100 μm, copper and zinc ions were most effective at inducing PrPSc protease resistance, whereas cobalt and nickel ions were less effective, and magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, silver, and aluminum ions were ineffective (Fig. 3). Additional dose-response experiments showed that the metal concentration at which PrPSc achieved 50% maximum protease resistance was 40 μm for copper and 30 μm for zinc (data not shown). These results suggest that PrPSc conformation is preferentially controlled by transition metals with either a 3d104s1 or 3d104s2 electron orbital arrangement. Ionic Strength and Copper Control the Conformation of PrP-(27–30)—Several studies have shown that the N-terminal octapeptide repeat domain of recombinant PrP binds copper ions cooperatively (22Viles J.H.

Baldwin M.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Additional studies indicate that PrP also contains a second high affinity copper-binding site outside of the octapeptide repeat domain (20Jackson G.S. Murray I. Hosszu L.L. Gibbs N. Waltho J.P.

J. 2001; 81: 516-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the octapeptide repeat domain is required for the effects of ionic strength and copper on PrPSc conformation by studying purified truncated PrP-(27–30) molecules. PrP-(27–30) molecules lacking the N-terminal octapeptide repeat domain were generated and partially purified by limited proteolysis and ultracentrifugation (28Bolton D.C. McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5898-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ionic strength and copper altered the protease sensitivity of purified PrP-(27–30) molecules in a manner similar to crude full-length PrPSc molecules (Fig. 4), indicating that the octapeptide repeat domain is not required for the conformational transition of PrPSc molecules. PrPSc Conformational Changes Are Reversible—We next investigated whether the changes in PrPSc conformation induced by ionic strength or transition metals are reversible. To investigate the reversibility of PrPSc conformational changes induced by ionic strength, we used ultracentrifugation to concentrate PrPSc molecules and facilitate buffer changes. The results of these buffer exchange experiments show that increasing the ionic strength increased the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules, whereas decreasing the ionic strength reduced the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules (Fig. 5A). To investigate the reversibility of PrPSc conformational changes induced by transition metals, we used EDTA to chelate copper molecules in a stoichiometric manner. The results of these chelator experiments show that increasing the concentration of free copper increased the protease resistance of PrPSc molecules and decreasing the free copper concentration had the opposite effect (Fig. 5B). Thus, our findings indicate that the PrPSc conformational changes induced by either ionic strength or copper are reversible. In Vitro PrPres Amplification Requires High Ionic Strength—As described above, the conformational state(s) of PrPSc molecules able to convert other PrP molecules is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether any of the PrPSc conformers that we identified could induce the conversion of PrPC substrates into PrPres molecules. We used a previously described in vitro PrPres amplification technique (14Nishina K. Deleault N.R. Lucassen R.W. Supattapone S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2613-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and enriched membrane preparations to study this question. Fig. 6 shows that efficient in vitro PrPres amplification required high ionic strength. Furthermore, this requirement for salt could not be circumvented by addition of either copper or zinc ions (Fig. 6). These experiments indicate that either 1) the protease-resistant PrPSc conformation induced by high ionic strength is the only conformation able to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules in our experiments, or 2) salt is required for a different role in the mechanism of PrPres formation. In this study, we have shown that PrPSc molecules can adopt several conformational states. Under conditions of high ionic strength, PrPSc molecules were relatively protease-resistant and able to induce the formation of PrPres in vitro, and under conditions of low ionic strength, PrPSc molecules were significantly more sensitive to protease digestion and appeared to be unable to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules. At low ionic strength, binding to copper and zinc ions could also cause PrPSc molecules to become protease-resistant, but under these conditions, PrPSc molecules remained unable to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules. Interestingly, PrPSc molecules could switch reversibly between these various conformations. These findings lead to the conclusion that PrPSc molecules have interconvertible structures and allow us to consider mechanistic models of PrPSc-induced conversion of PrPC molecules in which the PrPSc molecules themselves can undergo conformational changes. Ionic Strength Influences PrPSc Conformation—Our results show that ionic strength influences the conformation of PrPSc molecules in vitro. In the presence of membrane-solubilizing detergents, moderate concentrations of monovalent salts induced PrPSc molecules to become protease-resistant and able to induce the conversion of other PrP molecules. The minimum concentration of salt required for PrPSc protease resistance was ∼50 mm, and it is likely that, above this concentration, salts can shield electrostatic repulsions between like charged domains of PrPSc molecules. Interestingly, Surewicz and co-workers (29Maiti N.R. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2427-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Morillas M. Vanik D.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have shown that salt is required for the structural transition of truncated recombinant PrP molecules into β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils. Thus, electrostatic interactions may be important in two distinct aspects of PrP folding: 1) conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and 2) maintenance of a protease-resistant PrPSc conformation. How might the influence of salt on PrPSc conformation be relevant in living cells, which maintain constant levels of ionic strength? We propose two possible scenarios. 1) Normally, PrP molecules covalently attach to lipid raft membranes through a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol anchor (32Stahl N. Baldwin M.A. Burlingame A.L. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8879-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 33Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B.

https://openalex.org/W1978191478,"We recently have identified a new cytoplasmic linker protein (CLIP), CLIPR-59, which is involved in the regulation of early endosome/trans-Golgi network dynamics. In contrast with CLIP-170, CLIPR-59 is not localized to microtubules at steady state but is associated with the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane. Here we show that the last 30 amino acids (C30) are sufficient for membrane targeting and that two cysteines in the C30 domain are palmitoylated. We demonstrate that CLIPR-59 is associated with lipid rafts via its C-terminal palmitoylated domain. In vitro experiments suggest that CLIPR-59 and its microtubule-binding domain alone have a better affinity for unpolymerized tubulin or small oligomers than for microtubules. In contrast with the CLIP-170 microtubule-binding domain, the CLIPR-59 microtubule-binding domain diminishes microtubule regrowth after nocodazole washout in vivo, showing that this domain can prevent microtubule polymerization. In contrast with the role of linker between membranes and microtubules that was proposed for CLIP function, CLIPR-59 thus may have an “anti-CLIP” function by preventing microtubule-raft interactions.

The microtubule network is required for intracellular organization and movement. The dynamic instability of microtubules allows a rapid exploration of the cytoplasmic space, and the intrinsic asymmetry of the tubulin polymer is used by molecular motors to establish intracellular polarity. Cytoplasmic linker proteins (CLIPs), 1The abbreviations used are: CLIP, cytoplasmic linker protein; CLIPR-59, CLIP-170-related protein of 59 kDa; CAP-Gly, cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich domain; MTB, microtubule-binding domain; C59MTB, the MTB of CLIPR-59; TGN, trans-Golgi network; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GFP-C59, GFP-labeled CLIPR-59; GFP-ΔC60, GFP-labeled CLIPR-59 with the last 60 amino acids deleted; GFP-C30, enhanced GFP cDNA fused with the sequence encoding the last 30 amino acids of CLIPR-59; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; TfR, transferrin receptor; MβCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinedi-ethanesulfonic acid; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; NZ, nocodazole; DRM, detergent-resistant membrane(s); GPI, glycosylphosphatidyl inositol; PIC, protease inhibitor mixture. which are non-molecular motor microtubule-binding proteins, were also proposed to be involved in intracellular organization and organelle movement. Rickard and Kreis (1Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) proposed that CLIPs would transiently link membranes to microtubules, regulating molecular motor function and organelle movement. This model was proposed following the identification of CLIP-170, which was shown to be necessary for the interaction of endosomes with the microtubules (2Pierre P. Scheel J. Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 70: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). This model was further strengthened by the characterization of the Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein GMAP-210 (3Infante C. Ramos-Morales F. Fedriani C. Bornens M. Rios R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein CLIMP-63 (4Klopfenstein D.R. Klumperman J. Lustig A. Kammerer R.A. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1287-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The microtubule-binding domain of CLIP-170 contains a repetition of a microtubule binding motif, the CAP-Gly motif, found in other tubulin-interacting proteins. Interestingly, most of CLIP-170-related proteins are active at the organelle-microtubule interface as proposed for p150Glued (5Swaroop A. Swaroop M. Garen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 905-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), or a yet unidentified peroxisomal CLIP (9Thiemann M. Schrader M. Volkl A. Baumgart E. Fahimi H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6264-6275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another key aspect of CAP-Gly-containing proteins is that they usually interact with tubulin in a tightly regulated way. Certain proteins containing CAP-Gly are tubulin-folding cofactors that interact with α-tubulin in a preactivated stage (10Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas others, like CLIP-170, CLIP-115, or p150Glued, interact more strongly with polymerizing microtubule plus ends than with the rest of the polymer (11Diamantopoulos G.D. Perez F. Goodson H.V. Batelier G. Melki R. Kreis T.E. Rickard J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Hoogenraad C.C. Akhmanova A. Grosveld F. De Zeeuw C.I.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This interaction of CLIP-170 with microtubule plus ends may be because of an interaction of CLIP-170 with soluble, non-polymerized tubulin and subsequent co-polymerization during tubulin assembly (11Diamantopoulos G.D. Perez F. Goodson H.V. Batelier G. Melki R. Kreis T.E. Rickard J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and this may be important to promote microtubule rescue (14Komarova Y.A. Akhmanova A.S. Kojima S.-I. Galjart N. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We recently identified a new CLIP-170-related protein of 59 kDa (CLIPR-59) (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Like CLIP-170, the CLIPR-59 MTB (C59MTB) consists of two CAP-Gly motifs separated by a serine-rich region. Unlike CLIP-170, which is essentially partitioned between the microtubules and the cytosol, the full-length protein does not label microtubules quantitatively in vivo. Indeed, C59MTB was found to bind microtubules in vivo; however, no restricted plus end binding was observed, and only a subset of microtubules is labeled along their entire span. At steady state, CLIPR-59 is targeted to the plasma membrane and to trans-Golgi network (TGN) membranes by its 60-amino acid-long C-terminal membrane-targeting sequence (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We proposed that CLIPR-59 was a TGN-associated CLIP that, according to the CLIP model, would establish a static interaction between TGN membranes and microtubules, hence regulating membrane dynamics. CLIPR-59 is indeed involved in intracellular trafficking as its overexpression induces endosome relocalization and perturbs transferrin recycling as well as Shiga toxin B-fragment retrograde transport to the Golgi apparatus (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CLIPR-59 is targeted to the TGN is still unknown. In integral membrane proteins, the length of the transmembrane domain is thought to be involved in this process, and CLIPR-59 could bind to such an integral membrane receptor on Golgi membranes. Alternatively, CLIPR-59 may recognize the TGN directly through its membrane-targeting domain. Cellular membranes contain lateral heterogeneities, thus defining membrane subdomains, and CLIPR-59 could be targeted to specific membrane subdomains. Rafts are 10-300-nm microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that exist in liquid-ordered phase (lipid rafts) within more fluid membranes (16Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Depending on the cholesterol concentration, rafts are thought to exist from the TGN to the plasma membrane (17Ikonen E. Simons K. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). The recruitment of proteins to the ordered membrane seems to play a role in diverse functions such as signal transduction or intracellular trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that CLIPR-59 is associated with lipid rafts. We found that the last 30 amino acids of CLIPR-59 are necessary and sufficient to target it to the TGN and to the plasma membrane and that a double palmitoylation on tandem cysteines within this domain is responsible for the raft targeting. In addition, to test whether CLIPR-59 could function as a CLIP, we studied the activity of C59MTB. We show that in contrast with the CLIP-170 MTB, the CLIPR-59 MTB reduces microtubule elongation and displays a specific behavior in a microtubule cosedimentation assay. This first raft-associated CLIP could play an atypical role at the raft-microtubule junction. Cell Culture and Transfection—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stably transfected with a pCDNA6/TR plasmid from Invitrogen were given by H. de Thé (St. Louis Hospital, Paris, France) and cultured as described previously (19Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. Puvion F. Koken M. Honore N. Doubeikovsky A. Duprez E. Pandolfi P.P. Puvion E. Freemont P. de The H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transient and stable transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate precipitate method. Stable GFP-CLIPR-59-(GFP-C59-) and GFP-ΔC60-overexpressing MEFs were obtained by transfecting the GFP-C59 or -ΔC60 pCDNA4/TO constructs (Invitrogen) into MEF-TR cells and were selected for 3 weeks with 50 μg/ml Zeocin. Dilutions were performed, and different clones were selected for CLIPR-59 expression after induction with 2 mg/ml doxycycline (Clontech Laboratories) for 24-48 h. Plasmid Constructions—GFP- and HA-C59, -ΔC60, and -C59MTB cDNAs cloned into the pCB6 plasmid were described previously (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HA- or GFP-C59 F533A, AA, C534A, C535A, and W536A point mutants were generated by replacing the wild type sequence with adaptors containing a mutated sequence (MWG, Biotech France SA). pCDNA4/TO vector from Invitrogen was used to clone GFP-C59 and -ΔC60 cDNA for stable cell lines. The MBP-C59MTB fusion was obtained by cloning the C59MTB sequence in the pMalC3 plasmid, and the fusion His-C170H1 was described previously (20Scheel J. Pierre P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S.

Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody against GFP was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and antibodies against p150Glued, golgin-84, flotillin-2, and GM-130 were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Purified polyclonal anti-Rab6 antibody was obtained as described previously (21Goud B. Zahraoui A. Tavitian A. Saraste J. Nature. 1990; 345: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-HA and polyclonal antitubulin (T13) antibodies were described previously (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J.

Monoclonal H68.4 was used for mouse TfR detection in Western blotting on MEF extracts; horseradish peroxidase-tagged cholera toxin (Sigma) was used for detection of GM1 lipids on dot blot. Cy3-aerolysin was kindly provided by G. van der Goot (Centre Medico-Universitaire, Geneva, Switzerland). Alexa488-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, and Cy3-labeled ones were from Jackson Laboratory. Cell Treatments, Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa or MEF cells were cultured on glass coverslips. 24 h after transfection or doxycycline induction, cells were fixed for 20 min in 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min (in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin) or fixed for 4 min in methanol at -20 °C. For pre-extractions, coverslips were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100, PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) for a few seconds five times and then fixed in methanol. To deplete cholesterol from membranes, transfected HeLa cells grown on coverslips were treated with 5 mg/ml methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) for 10 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 3% PFA. 200 μm bromopalmitate was used to inhibit palmitoylation on doxycycline-induced MEF cells grown on coverslips prior to fixation in PFA. Wide field images were acquired on a Leica microscope DMRA controlled by the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) running on a Dell personal computer. Confocal images were acquired on a Leica SP2 microscope. Figures were then assembled using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 running on a Macintosh G4. [3H]Palmitate Labeling—106 HeLa cells transfected with GFP-C59 or mutant constructs were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) without serum containing 125 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-GFP antibody and protein G-Sepharose in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) containing PIC (protease inhibitor mixture) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by anti-GFP immunoblot or were fixed and treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 3H fluorography (2-week exposition). Protein Purification, Western Blots, and Dot Blots—BL21 bacteria transformed with pMalC3-C59MTB were cultured in 200 ml of LB broth, induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h, and lysed in 5 ml of PEM buffer with PIC by snap-freezing or Bio-101 Fastprep (pulse, 20 s; amplitude, 6). Bacterial extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, and proteins were purified from the 4 ml of supernatant on 2 ml of amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Elution was performed in 12 ml of 10 mm PEM/PIC/maltose and collected in 1-ml fractions. His-C170H1 was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) as described previously (20Scheel J. Pierre P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M.

For Western blot analysis, cell extracts, membranes, or microtubule pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred or spotted (for dot blot) onto a 0.2-μm reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) that was blocked with Western blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science), were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and with secondary antibodies for 1 h, were washed, and were revealed by a Pico or Femto SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Membrane Extraction and Raft Purification—106 GFP-C59- or GFP-ΔC60-overexpressing MEF cells were resuspended in 3 mm imidazole, 0.25 m sucrose buffer with PIC on ice for 15 min, then broken with a 22-gauge needle or with a ball-bearing cell cracker, and centrifuged to remove nuclei and large cell debris. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was incubated with ice-cold 1% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TL100 centrifuge. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Western blot. To purify lipid rafts, 3 × 107 MEF cells were resuspended in 300 ml of TE buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA) with PIC and lysed with a cell cracker. An equal volume of 2% Triton X-100 or Lubrol-WX in TE, 300 mm NaCl was then added. PNS was obtained by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min) and kept on ice for 30 min. Optiprep gradient was performed as follows. Optiprep (800 μl) was added to the PNS (400 μl) to obtain a 40% final concentration and loaded at the bottom of the centrifugation tube. 2.3 ml of 30% Optiprep, 150 mm NaCl, TE and 0.8 ml of 5% Optiprep, 150 mm NaCl, and TE were carefully added without perturbing the interfaces. The gradient was centrifuged for 4 h at 4 °C at 28,000 rpm (rotor SW41). Fractions were collected from the top to the bottom, and fraction 2, corresponding to the 0.5:30% interface, contained lipid rafts. In Vitro/In Vivo Microtubule Polymerization and Co-sedimentation Assay—For co-sedimentation assays, pig brain purified tubulin was precentrifuged for 10 min at 60,000 × g and 4 °C to remove oligomers prior to assay. 107 GFP-C59- or -ΔC60-overexpressing MEF cells were lysed by cell cracker in PEM buffer, and PNS in 1% Triton X-100 was obtained as described above. PNS was diluted 3-5× in PEM on ice, separated into five fractions, and subjected to different treatments: PEMG (PEM + 10% glycerol), PEMG + 1 m NaCl, and PEMG + 1 mm GTP + purified tubulin (0 or 0.3 or 0.6 mg/ml). Microtubule polymerization was induced in the last three fractions by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min and addition of 20 μm Taxol for 15 min at 37 °C; the first two fractions were kept on ice. All fractions were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. To depolymerize the microtubule network the same centrifugation was performed with 10 μm nocodazole (NZ)-treated cells lysed and incubated at 4 °C. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Western blot. Microtubule polymerization was performed as above with or without purified MBP-C59MTB or His-C170MTB (40 μg/ml) in the presence of an increased concentration of purified tubulin (0.5-2.5 mg/ml) instead of cell extract. This compares well with the concentration of tubulin in the cytosol (20 μm; Ref. 22Hiller G. Weber K. Cell. 1978; 14: 795-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For the microtubule regrowth assay, the microtubules of GFP C59MTB- or GFP-C170H1-overexpressing HeLa cells growing on coverslips were depolymerized by incubating the cells at 4 °C for 20 min before adding 10 μm NZ at 37 °C for 2 h. Microtubule regrowth was allowed by washing out NZ and incubating at 20 °C; the coverslips were prepermeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, PEM buffer to eliminate soluble tubulin and GFP-C59MTB proteins and then were fixed in methanol (4 min at -20 °C) at different periods of time. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence to stain microtubules and imaged as described above, using the same exposure time for each condition. Quantification of microtubule regrowth was done using the Metamorph software to quantify the mean fluorescence (in the tubulin channel) of control cells or cells overexpressing GFP-C59MTB or GFP-C170H1. The Last 30 Amino Acids of CLIPR-59 Are a Membrane-targeting Domain—We have shown previously that CLIPR-59 is targeted to the TGN and the plasma membrane via the C-terminal part of the protein; the deletion of the last 60 amino acids (GFP-ΔC60) prevents CLIPR-59 from membrane targeting, inducing a cytosolic distribution (Figs. 1A and 2) (15Perez F. Pernet-Gallay K. Nizak C. Goodson H.V. Kreis T.E. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Within this region, colored in gray in Fig. 1B, only a short C-terminal sequence of 10 amino acids is hydrophobic. Although its size would not be enough to cross membranes, we wanted to determine whether this hydrophobic sequence is enough to target CLIPR-59 to membranes. We fused the enhanced GFP cDNA to the sequence coding for the last 30 amino acids of CLIPR-59 (GFP-C30). Immunofluorescence experiments performed on GFP-C30 transiently transfected HeLa cells showed that the GFP-C30 protein was addressed to membranes and co-localized with the cis-Golgi marker GM-130 (Fig. 1A). This distribution is similar to the TGN localization of the GFP-CLIPR-59 full-length protein (GFP-C59; Fig. 1A, arrows). In cells expressing a higher amount of GFP-C30 or GFP-C59 proteins, the plasma membrane was also labeled indicating that CLIPR-59 distribution was not restricted to but concentrated on Golgi membranes (Fig. 1A, arrowhead). The C30 domain of CLIPR-59 is thus sufficient for membrane targeting.Fig. 2Subcellular localization of CLIPR-59 point mutants expressed in HeLa cells. Cells overexpressing HA-CLIPR-59 (HA-C59) or HA-C59ΔC60, HA-C59-CC/AA, HA-C59-F533A, HA-C59-C534A, HA-C59-C535A, or HA-C59-W536A mutants were stained with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (top panels), counterstained with an antibody against the trans-Golgi TGN marker GalT (middle panels), and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

To investigate whether such posttranslational modifications are involved in the membrane targeting of CLIPR-59, we generated point mutants by replacing both of these cysteines or each of them separately with alanines. We also replaced with alanines the amino acids preceding and following the tandem cysteines, a phenylalanine and a tryptophan, respectively, to control the selective effect of the mutations. This was particularly interesting because a phenylalanine preceding tandem cysteines was found in other proteins like SCG10 (23Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which localized like CLIPR-59 from the TGN to the plasma membrane (see “Discussion”). Each mutant was HA-tagged and transfected in HeLa cells, and its subcellular localization was analyzed by double immunofluorescence with anti-HA and anti-GM-130 antibodies. Like the mutant deleted from the C60 domain, the HA-C59-CC/AA double mutant and HA-C59-F533A phenylalanine mutant were completely cytosolic (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the HA-C59-W536A mutant co-localized with GM-130 and localized to the plasma membrane. The HA-C59-C534A and the HA-C59-C535A single mutants were partly cytosolic and partly associated with membranes, but HA-C59-C535A was more widely distributed in the cytosol than HA-C59-C534A (Fig. 2). The same subcellular localizations were observed with GFP-tagged mutants (not shown). This indicates that both cysteines, as well as the upstream phenylalanine, are necessary for membrane targeting of CLIPR-59. We then tested whether these cysteines were palmitoylated. HeLa cells overexpressing the GFP-C59 protein or the GFP-ΔC60 cytosolic mutant were labeled with [3H]palmitate, and palmitoylation of the recombinant proteins was analyzed after immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3A, CLIPR-59 incorporated 3H, whereas the ΔC60 deletion mutant did not, indicating that the C-terminal part of the protein was modified by palmitate or a palmitate derivative. We repeated [3H]palmitate labeling and immunoprecipitation with GFP-tagged point mutants (n = 2). The C59-CC/AA mutant was not palmitoylated (Fig. 3A). The C534A, the C535A, and the F533A single mutations reduced but did not completely prevent CLIPR-59 palmitoylation. In addition, a higher amount of radioactivity seems to be incorporated in the C59-C534A mutant than in the C59-C535A mutant, suggesting that the Cys535 is the major site for palmitoylation. The downstream tryptophan is not involved in CLIPR-59 palmitoylation because the C59-W536A mutant was normally modified. Thus, both cysteines are palmitoylated, and this modification requires the conservation of the adjacent phenylalanine. The membrane localization of CLIPR-59 wild type and mutants is thus the exact reflection of their respective palmitate modification, further indicating that tandem palmitoylation is required for correct CLIPR-59 localization. We then used bromopalmitate to decrease CLIPR-59 palmitoylation (24Webb Y. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 261-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). GFP-C59 labeling was restricted to TGN membranes in treated cells showing that efficient CLIPR-59 palmitoylation is necessary for its localization (Fig. 3B). Note that by Western blot, wild type and mutant CLIPR-59 migrate as a double band (Figs. 3A, 4A, and 5). Why these doublets were observed is unclear; they are not due to palmitoylation because they were still observed with the mutants.Fig. 4Interaction of CLIPR-59 with detergent-resistant membranes.A, MEF cells stably overexpressing GFPCLIPR-59 (GFP-C59) or GFP-CLIPR-59ΔC60 (GFP-ΔC60) were treated or not with 1% Triton X-100 (TX-100), 1 m NaCl, or 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and fractionated to separate high speed pellet (P) and supernatant (S). The analysis of protein partition was done by Western blotting using anti-GFP and anti-TfR antibodies. A representative experiment of eight independent experiments is shown here.

The tetracycline-inducible system was used in the MEF cell line to overcome the toxicity of stable CLIPR-59 overexpression. Clones with a low expression level were selected to conserve the TGN and plasma membrane localization of CLIPR-59 and to prevent side effects observed upon overexpression (Figs. 3B and 4B). PNSs of these overexpressing cells were treated or not with ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 buffer, and membranes were subsequently purified with high speed centrifugation.

https://openalex.org/W1985274797,"Many of the completely sequenced cyanobacterial genomes contain a gene family that encodes for putative Rieske iron-sulfur proteins. The Rieske protein is one of the large subunits of the cytochrome bc-type complexes involved in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transfer. In contrast to all other subunits of this complex that are encoded by single genes, the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 contains three petC genes, all encoding potential Rieske subunits. Most interestingly, any of the petC genes can be deleted individually without altering the Synechocystis phenotype dramatically. In contrast, double deletion experiments revealed that petC1 and petC2 cannot be deleted in combination, whereas petC3 can be deleted together with any of the other two petC genes. Further results suggest a different physiological function for each of the Rieske proteins. Whereas PetC2 can partly replace the dominating Rieske isoform PetC1, PetC3 is unable to functionally replace either PetC1 or PetC2 and may have a special function involving a special donor with a lower redox potential than plastoquinone. A predominant role of PetC1, which is (partly) different from PetC2, is suggested by the mutational analysis and a detailed characterization of the electron transfer reactions in the mutant strains.

A predominant role of PetC1, which is (partly) different from PetC2, is suggested by the mutational analysis and a detailed characterization of the electron transfer reactions in the mutant strains. In 1997 the complete DNA sequence of the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 was published (1Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). About 3200 open reading frames were identified within the genome, and for about 55% of them a function was inferred by similarity and homology searches, whereas the function of the remaining open reading frames remained unclear (2Kaneko T. Tabata S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although computational analysis indicated the occurrence of many gene families, the function of these is elusive so far. The best investigated example at present is the D1 protein of photosystem II, which is encoded by three different psbA genes (3Mohamed A. Eriksson J. Osiewacz H.D. Jansson C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 4Salih G.F. Jansson C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was shown that all three genes encode functional D1 proteins, although only psbD1 and psbD2 are expressed at a significant level. Similarly, three potential petC genes are present encoding for the Rieske subunit of the cytochrome b6f complex (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Rieske protein is an essential subunit of all cytochrome bc complexes, where it is involved in quinol binding and electron transfer within the complex. In addition to the Rieske protein, cytochrome bc1 complexes contain the cytochrome b subunit carrying two b-type hemes and a c-type cytochrome with one covalently bound heme. Although in the cytochrome b6f complex the b-type cytochrome is split into the two subunits cytochrome b6 and subunit IV (6Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the overall structure is conserved, and both complexes can transfer electrons from a quinol to the c-type cytochrome (7Hauska G. Büttner M. Gräber P. Milazzo G. Bioenergetics. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1997: 389-417Crossref Google Scholar). The structures of the cytochrome bc1 complexes as well as of the cytochrome b6f complex have been determined by x-ray crystallography recently (8Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D. Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 9Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z.

Although the sequence similarities between the Rieske proteins from both complexes are quite low (11Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), structural analysis of the water-soluble parts of these proteins revealed a highly conserved three-dimensional structure (11Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Murzin A.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the genomic sequence of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803, no genes encoding subunits of a cytochrome bc1 complex were found, i.e. the cytochrome b6f complex is an essential component of both the respiratory and the photosynthetic electron transfer chain. In general, the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria harbors a mixed photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chain (13Schmetterer G. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 409-435Crossref Google Scholar) with the plastoquinone pool receiving electrons from both photosystem II and from respiratory dehydrogenases; these are then transferred via the cytochrome b6f complex and soluble carriers (plastocyanin or cytochrome c6) to photosystem I and the terminal respiratory oxidase. Due to this central function of the cytochrome b6f complex, it is impossible to delete crucial subunits of this complex (14Osiewacz H.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Within the cyanobacterial cytochrome b6f complex only for the Rieske subunit a gene family has been found. Besides Synechocystis, which contains three potentials Rieske genes, multiple Rieske genes have also been shown to exist in other cyanobacteria like Synechococcus PCC 7002 and Anabaena PCC 7120. However, in contrast to the psbA gene family, up to now no specific physiological function is known for the petC gene family encoding for the Rieske subunit. In this study the function of the three petC genes in Synechocystis PCC 6803 was investigated by deletional mutagenesis of petC genes and by characterization of the generated mutants. The presented results show that all petC genes can be deleted individually without altering the Synechocystis phenotype dramatically. Although petC1 and petC2 can be deleted individually, it was not possible to delete the genes in combination in Synechocystis wild type (wt). 1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild type; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; E, einstein; DBMIB, 2,5-dibromomethylisopropyl-p-benzoquinone. This indicates that petC2 and petC1 have at least partly overlapping functions and that petC2 can complement for the petC1 deletion. Further detailed characterization of the ΔpetC1 strain suggested that the function of petC1 can only to some degree be substituted by petC2, and the deletion of petC1 leads to a partial loss of the cytochrome b6f complex function. Growth Conditions—Synechocystis PCC 6803 wt and mutant strains were grown at 30 °C in BG11 media (15Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) under cool-white fluorescent illumination at a light intensity of 40 μE m–2 s–1. Transformation of Synechocystis with plasmids was carried out as described previously (16Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Because Synechocystis contains several identical genome copies, numerous rounds of selection on BG11 plates with increasing amounts of spectinomycin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol (5–100 μg/ml) were necessary to obtain fully segregated mutants. For completeness of the segregation, individual clones were tested by PCR. Growth of the wt and mutant strains was monitored at 730 nm (OD730) under photoautotrophic, photomixothrophic (+10 mm glucose), or photoheterotrophic conditions (+10 mm glucose, +10 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU)). Escherichia coli strain DH5α, which was used for plasmid propagation, was grown in LB broth or agar supplemented as needed with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, or 30 μg/ml spectinomycin, respectively. DNA Techniques—Molecular cloning was carried out by using standard techniques according to Ref. 17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Enzymes used for PCR and cloning were obtained from MBI Fermentas. PCR was carried out using a Bio-Rad Thermocycler. DNA sequencing was performed by MWG Biotec (Ebersberg, Germany). For PCR, genomic DNA of Synechocystis PCC 6803 was prepared as described recently (18Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and inactivation of the various petC genes in Synechocystis PCC 6803 was done following the protocol in Ref. 16Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar. Oxygen Evolution—Oxygen evolution rates were measured at 30 °C using a Clark-type oxygen electrode under actinic light (600 μE m–2 s–1). Synechocystis cells were harvested in the mid-log phase and diluted to a chlorophyll concentration of 20 μg/ml in BG11 medium. Oxygen evolution was measured after addition of 0.5 mm 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone or of 10 mm NaHCO3. Spectroscopic Methods—77 K fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in an Aminco fluorimeter with a chlorophyll concentration of 5 μg/ml (19Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. Rögner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were diluted by BG11 medium and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Monochromators were set to a slit width of 4 nm. The yield of the variable chlorophyll fluorescence (FV) from photosystem II depends on the redox state of QA, the primary quinone acceptor, and, indirectly, also on the state of the plastoquinone pool, which thus can be monitored by using chlorophyll fluorescence measurements (20Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. Rogner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Light-induced changes of chlorophyll fluorescence were measured at 686 nm in a laboratory-built set up at room temperature (23 °C), using a 1 × 1-cm cuvette with a 2-ml sample volume. Cells were incubated for 2 min in the dark at a chlorophyll concentration of 2.5 μm in BG-11 medium, with or without further additions, as indicated in the figure legends. After the dark incubation, the cells were illuminated with blue light (center wavelength of 445 nm, intensity of 205 μE m–2 s–1). Illumination was controlled by an electronic photoshutter; the duration of the light pulse was 250 ms or 1 s, respectively, as indicated. The level of minimum fluorescence, Fo, which corresponds to the oxidized state of QA, was determined from the initial fast phase of fluorescence rise, which was concomitant with shutter opening. After addition of 10 μm of the photosystem II inhibitor DCMU and another 2 min of dark incubation, each sample was illuminated again to determine the maximum fluorescence Fmax, which corresponds to the reduced state of QA. The variable fluorescence was calculated as FV = Fmax – Fo. Insertional Deletion of the Three Putative petC Genes—The three open reading frames of Synechocystis PCC 6803 encoding putative Rieske proteins were assigned petC1 (sll1316), petC2 (slr1185), and petC3 (sll1182) (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Schneider D. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 228: 37-48PubMed Google Scholar) with the numbers given in parentheses showing the deposited name in the Cyano data base (22Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The gene encoding the PetC1 protein was amplified with flanking regions by PCR and cloned into the plasmid pUC18 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after restriction of the PCR product using restriction sites that had been introduced by the primers. A 260-bp fragment from the petC1 encoding and upstream region was replaced by a chloramphenicol resistance cassette, which was amplified by PCR without a transcription termination signal (Fig. 1). By this method the promoter of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) cassette can be used for the transcription of petA encoding for the cytochrome f subunit in Synechocystis. A wild type Synechocystis PCC 6803 strain was used for transformation of the deletion construct, and transformants were grown on plates containing increasing amounts of chloramphenicol to select for complete segregation and to obtain a homozygous genotype. For the inactivation of petC2, the gene was amplified by PCR with flanking regions, and after ligation of the PCR product to the plasmid pBluescript II SK (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), a 640-bp fragment was replaced by a spectinomycin resistance cassette from pHP45Ω (23Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Wild type, ΔpetC1, and ΔpetC3 strains of Synechocystis PCC 6803 were transformed with this construct to yield the appropriate single or double deletion strains. For deletion of petC3, the gene was amplified by PCR with flanking regions and cloned into the plasmid pASK-IBA4 (IBA GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). To inactivate the petC3 gene, a 215-bp DNA fragment was replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette obtained from the plasmid pBSL14 (24Alexeyev M.F. BioTechniques. 1995; 18 (54, 56): 52PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting construct was transformed into the wt, the ΔpetC1, and the ΔpetC2 strain to obtain the single and double deletion strain. For complete segregation of the ΔpetC3 cells, mutants were selected on BG11 plates containing increasing amounts of kanamycin. PCR was used to test whether the various strains were homozygous for the deletion of the different petC genes (Fig. 1). Although the PCR fragments of the DNA regions containing the wt gene were less than 1000 bp in size, the introduction of the respective resistant cassettes increased the size of these PCR fragments by more than 500 bp (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 also shows that the individual deletion of all three petC genes is possible. In neither case was a fragment corresponding to the size of the wt DNA fragment amplified. The simultaneous deletion of petC2 with petC3 was possible as well as the deletion of petC1 in combination with petC3. All attempts to delete petC2 completely in the ΔpetC1 strain failed (Fig. 1) as well as attempts to delete petC1 in the ΔpetC2 strain. These results indicate an overlapping function of these two genes, whereas the function of petC3 does not seem to overlap directly with the possible roles of the other two petC genes. Effect of the petC Deletions on Cell Growth—To test whether the deletions have any effect on cell viability under different growth conditions, growth rates of the completely segregated mutant strains relative to the wt were measured under photoautotrophic, mixotrophic, and photoheterotrophic growth conditions, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 2, strains carrying the single deletions ΔpetC2 or ΔpetC3, as well as the ΔpetC2/3 double deletion do not alter significantly in their growth properties under any of the tested growth conditions when compared with wt cells; this suggests a nonessential function of PetC2 and PetC3 under the chosen growth conditions. Although the ΔpetC1 strain shows similar growth rates as the wt strain under photomixotrophic, and photoheterotrophic conditions (Fig. 2) the growth rate is slowed down under photoautotrophic conditions. It should be noted that growth of this mutant in the presence of chloramphenicol, i.e. the antibiotic used for obtaining a completely segregated deletion strain, resulted in highly impaired growth under photoheterotrophic conditions (data not shown); this indicates a considerable stress of the ΔpetC1 strain caused by the gene deletion. Most interestingly, although the single deletion of petC3 did not cause any observable growth defect and the single deletion of petC1 had a somewhat stronger impact on the growth properties, the combination of both in the double deletion strain ΔpetC1/3 resulted in a distinctly increased doubling time under all tested growth conditions when compared with the wt strain. Chlorophyll Fluorescence as a Probe for the Reduction and Reoxidation of the PQ Pool—To examine the effect of the petC1 deletion on the redox activity of the cytochrome b6f complex, the photooxidation of the PQ pool by photosystem I was monitored by measuring the chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II, which is dependent on the redox state of QA and thus indirectly reflects the redox state of the PQ pool. In order to obtain a reduced PQ pool in darkness (due to PQ reduction by respiratory dehydrogenases), wt and ΔpetC1 cells were incubated with 1 mm KCN, which blocks the reoxidation by the terminal oxidases. During a subsequent illumination of wt cells, the yield of variable fluorescence (FV) increases quickly at the onset of illumination but returns to a low level after a short lag phase due to the fast photooxidation of PQH2 by photosystem I (Fig. 3). In contrast, the reoxidation of PQH2 is drastically slowed down in the ΔpetC1 cells, and the transient increase of FV is much stronger with about 60% of the maximum yield of FV. This is about three times higher than in wt and indicates a decreased rate of electron transport between the photosystems, indicating a severely impaired activity of the cytochrome b6f complex in ΔpetC1 cells. In addition to the cytochrome b6f complex, plastoquinol can also be oxidized by a cytochrome bd-type oxidase in Synechocystis PCC 6803 (20Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. Rogner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Pils D. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Pils D. Gregor W. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 83-88Crossref Google Scholar, 27Howitt C.A. Vermaas W.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17944-17951Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). If PQH2 oxidation could only occur via the cytochrome b6f complex, illumination of the cyanobacterial cells in the presence of DBMIB, a cytochrome b6f complex inhibitor, should result in a completely reduced PQ pool. For this reason, the partial quenching of FV in the presence of saturating concentrations of DBMIB, as shown in Fig. 4A, is evidence for such an alternative route of PQH2 oxidation (20Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. Rogner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On average, photoheterotrophically grown wt cells (Fig. 4A) show a quenching of 28 ± 10% (n = 10) of the total yield of FV. ΔpetC1 cells show a similar effect (Fig. 4B), but here a significantly higher amount of FV quenching (52 ± 3%, n = 4) is observed, indicating a distinctly higher oxidation rate of the PQ pool via the cytochrome bd-type complex in this mutant. As a control, the cells were illuminated in the presence of both DBMIB and KCN. In this case, a rapid reduction of the PQ pool during illumination is expected, as neither respiratory nor light-dependent oxidation of plastoquinol is possible. Indeed, this effect could be observed for both wt (Fig. 4C) and mutant cells (Fig. 4D). Identical measurements have also been performed with the ΔpetC2 and ΔpetC3 strains; however, there are no significant differences in comparison to wt. FV quenching in the presence of DBMIB (conditions as in Fig. 4, A and B) was 18 ± 1% (n = 4) in ΔpetC2 and 19 ± 7% (n = 4) in ΔpetC3 (not shown). Photosynthetic Activity—In order to test the photosynthetic activities of the generated deletion strains, the rate of oxygen evolution was determined for all ΔpetC strains using phenyl-p-benzoquinone as electron acceptor at photosystem II. These measurements, which were normalized to the total chlorophyll concentration, indicate an ∼60% reduced amount of active photosystem II in the ΔpetC1 and ΔpetC1/3 strains in comparison with wt (Fig. 5). Photosystem II activity in the other mutant strains was also impaired, although to a lesser extent as in the case of the ΔpetC1 strain. Using HCO–3 as electron acceptor allows the determination of the activity of the whole electron transport chain. With this acceptor the ΔpetC1 mutant cells showed only 40% of the activity of wt cells (175 ± 5 versus 57 ± 9% μmol O2/(mg of chlorophyll·h)). The strain carrying the double deletion ΔpetC1/3 showed similar photosystem II activity as the ΔpetC1 strain as can be seen in Fig. 5. In contrast, all other mutant strains, i.e. ΔpetC2, ΔpetC3, and ΔpetC2/3, were similar active as the wt. To study further the reason for the decreased oxygen evolution rate in the ΔpetC1 strain, wt and ΔpetC1 cells were analyzed by 77 K fluorescence spectroscopy. The relative content of photosystem I and II in the thylakoid membrane of cyanobacteria can be determined from their fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K. Upon chlorophyll excitation at 435 nm, photosystem II shows a characteristic emission spectrum with maxima at 695 and 685 nm, and photosystem I shows a characteristic emission maxima at 725 nm. The emission spectra shown in Fig. 6 indicate an increased photosystem I content relative to photosystem II in the ΔpetC1 mutants, whereas the photosystem I to photosystem II ration in the ΔpetC2 and ΔpetC3 mutants was identical to wt (data not shown). A decreased photosystem II content rather than an increased photosystem I content in the ΔpetC1 strain is supported by the observation that the concentration of chlorophyll per cell (cell density measured as OD730) is decreased by more than 7% in the ΔpetC1 mutant strain. In summary, the oxygen evolution measurements as well as the 77 K fluorescence measurements indicate a reduced photosystem II content in the ΔpetC1 strain. Presence of Multiple Genes for Rieske Proteins—To investigate the specific role of three potential Rieske proteins in Synechocystis PCC 6803, their genes have been deleted individually and in combination. In general, the deletion of subunits of the cyanobacterial cytochrome b6f complex is difficult because this complex has a central role for both the photosynthetic and the respiratory electron transport chain of cyanobacteria (14Osiewacz H.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Up to now, only the successful deletion of the gene encoding the small subunit PetM was reported (19Schneider D. Berry S. Rich P. Seidler A. Rögner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16780-16785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which, however, does not seem to have an essential function. Here we show that the complete deletion of each of the three petC genes alone is possible. These results are in contrast to a recent report (28Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) on deletion of the petC1 gene in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7002. In this study, deletion of petC1 did not lead to a viable ΔpetC1 segregant, and the authors concluded that petC2 and petC3 are silent with respect to a possible function in the cytochrome b6f complex. However, the authors did not perform deletions of the two additional petC genes, and potentially overlapping function of any of the petC genes was not studied. In addition, it is possible that the function of the two additional petC genes is less important in Synechococcus than in Synechocystis making a deletion of petC1 impossible in Synechococcus. Our attempts to delete petC1 in Synechocystis completely, using a resistance cassette with a transcription termination signal, also failed, most likely because of an interruption of the petA transcription. Only the use of a resistant cassette without a transcription termination signal resulted in a successful deletion of petC1. Most likely in this case the cat promoter is also used for the transcription of the petA gene. The deletion experiments also indicate that petC2 does not have any special function in the Synechocystis cytochrome b6f complex. Although the single deletion of petC2 did not result in a significantly altered phenotype, the ΔpetC2/3 double deletion strain was also unaffected in the stoichiometry or the activity of the photosynthetic protein complexes and in the growth rate (doubling time) of the strain. Although the single deletion of petC3 did not result in significantly altered growth properties of the mutant strain, the results obtained with the ΔpetC1/3 double deletion strain indicate that petC3 shares some function with petC1. Because the double deletion was possible, the functions of these two genes seem to be different and not replaceable as in the case of petC1 and petC2. Whereas the phenotype of the ΔpetC1/3 mutant was basically identical to the ΔpetC1 strain, the combined deletion of petC1 and petC2 turned out to be impossible. From these data we conclude that the Rieske protein PetC2 can indeed replace the Rieske protein PetC1 in the cytochrome b6f complex to some extent. This is consistent with the relative high sequence similarity and especially with the similar midpoint potential of these two proteins (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also the fact that the petC2 gene is functionally expressed in Synechocystis supports the view of various co-existing Rieske proteins in the cytochrome b6f complex of this organism (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because it was already shown that petC3 is also functionally expressed in Synechocystis and that the encoded protein is associated with the cytochrome b6f complex, although to rather low extent (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the results presented in this study indicate a function of PetC3 that is different from the function of PetC1. We showed recently (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that the petC3 gene encodes for a truncated Rieske protein with a highly lowered midpoint potential. The observation of this study that PetC3 seems to have some function in vivo together with the observed highly lowered midpoint potential argue for the existence of different cytochrome b6f complexes in Synechocystis as has been suggested. PetC1 Is the Main Rieske Protein in Synechocystis PCC 6803—As the cytochrome b6f complex is a central component of the energy-transducing system of Synechocystis PCC 6803, it seemed unlikely that the deletion of an essential subunit such as the Rieske protein would be possible. However, our results show that the petC1 gene can be deleted and that its function can at least partly be replaced by another petC gene. Nevertheless, in contrast to the ΔpetC2 and ΔpetC3 strains, the ΔpetC1 mutant strain showed some new characteristics when compared with the wt, indicating an important and specific role of the petC1 gene. The electron transfer through the cytochrome b6f complex was still possible in this mutant, although the activity of the complex seemed to be impaired, and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed a significant reduction of the PQ reoxidation rate by the cytochrome b6f complex (Fig. 3). In addition, an increased activity of the cytochrome bd-type complex was indicated in the ΔpetC1 mutant strain (Fig. 4) by fluorescence measurements. Synechocystis PCC 6803 contains three different respiratory terminal oxidases (25Pils D. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 217-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Howitt C.A. Vermaas W.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17944-17951Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two of them are homologous to the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, and the third one, the cytochrome bd-type complex, is a quinol oxidase that can function in parallel to the cytochrome b6f complex. Its function in thylakoid membranes of Synechocystis PCC 6803 has been elucidated recently (20Berry S. Schneider D. Vermaas W.F. Rogner M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3422-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was shown that the activity of the cytochrome bd-type complex increases in particular when the rate of plastoquinol oxidation via the cytochrome b6f complex appears to be insufficient. The changes in the electron transport system as well as the decreased photosystem II content of the ΔpetC1 mutant strain can be interpreted as adjustments in response to the partially defective cytochrome b6f complex and more reduced PQ pool. On the other hand, the fact that photosystem I seems to be assembled at wild-type levels (as judged from the 77 K fluorescent spectra) and that photosynthetic electron transfer through the whole electron transport chain is still operative indicates rather strongly that the cytochrome b6f complex is still active. Finally, the diminished growth of the ΔpetC1 strains under photoautotrophic conditions is in agreement with the observation that the photosystem II content is lowered in this mutant resulting in less provided energy by the photosynthetic light reaction. But why does the ΔpetC1 strain show characteristics indicating a less active cytochrome b6f complex? The presented mutational data indicate that petC2 can partly compensate for the petC1 deletion, although the activity of the complex is lowered to some degree. In two recent studies the electron transfer activity of the cytochrome b6f complex Rieske protein with mutations in the flexible hinge region was analyzed. This glycine-rich region connects the transmembrane domain with the soluble domain, and it was shown in the cytochrome bc1 complex that the activity of the complex is very sensitive to perturbations of the sequence and structure of that hinge region (29Nett J.H. Hunte C. Trumpower B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Darrouzet E. Valkova-Valchanova M. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, changes in the flexible regions of the cytochrome b6f complex Rieske proteins did not alter the complex function as dramatically as observed with the cytochrome bc1 complex (28Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35de Vitry C. Finazzi G. Baymann F. Kallas T. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2031-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, even in these studies changes were observed indicating an important role of this region for proper function of the Rieske protein. In contrast to PetC1 and other Rieske proteins, PetC2 contains one glutamine and one lysine residue in the hinge region that can highly diminish the flexibility of that region, and electrostatic interactions to other subunits are possibly favored. Because the electron transfer within the cytochrome bc complex Rieske proteins is accomplished by a movement of the soluble Rieske domain (10Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 36Breyton C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13195-13201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the observed differences in the amino acid sequence in the hinge region could cause less flexibility resulting in impaired electron transfer by domain movement. petC Gene Families in Cyanobacteria—A recent genome-wide expression analysis in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 showed the functional expression of multiple petC genes (37Ehira S. Ohmori M. Sato N. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The aim of that study was to investigate the up-regulation of genes after nitrogen deprivation, and the authors could show that the two putative Rieske genes all0606 and all1512, which encode for proteins with a high degree of homology to Synechocystis PetC3 and PetC2 proteins, respectively, were up-regulated more that 5.0-fold under the chosen growth conditions. Because petC1, which is cotranscribed with petA in cyanobacteria (38Kallas T. Spiller S. Malkin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5794-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), is the mainly transcribed petC gene, these results indicate the functional expression of three Rieske proteins both in Anabaena and in Synechocystis. Although in many of the cyanobacterial genomes, such as in Synechococcus PCC 7002 and Anabaena PCC 7120, a petC gene family can be found, only the main petC gene, which is cotranscribed with petA, is present in the genomes of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (39Schneider D. Altenfeld U. Thomas H. Schrader S. Muhlenhoff U. Rögner M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1491: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 40Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Ikeuchi M. Katoh H.

DNA Res. 2002; 9: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and of the mesophilic cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 (41Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Sato S. Mimuro M. Miyashita H. Tsuchiya T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Kawashima K. Kishida Y. Kiyokawa C. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Yamada M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2003; 10: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Therefore, the occurrence of a petC gene family seems to be common but not obligatory in cyanobacteria. This is in good agreement with our observation that the additional petC copies petC2 and petC3 can be deleted without any significant effect. In higher plants, the functional expression of two almost identical chloroplast Rieske proteins is also reported (14Osiewacz H.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the similar expression pattern of the two genes and their high degree of sequence identity argue rather for the simultaneous expression of two petC genes encoded by both parental chromosomes. In this case no special function of the different Rieske proteins is expected. As outlined in the Introduction, petC is not the only gene for which a gene multiplication has been found in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Best characterized is psbA encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II with three gene copies. In principle, the expression of all three genes leads to a functional D1 protein (4Salih G.F. Jansson C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although under standard growth conditions more than 90% of the total psbA transcripts originate from the psbA2 gene and the remaining part from the psbA3 gene. In contrast to the petC genes, the psbA2/3 genes share 99% nucleotide identity and encode identical proteins. The function of these various D1 proteins is not yet completely clear although increased synthesis of psbA3 has been observed under stress conditions (42Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Perewoska I. Mate Z. Nagy F. Etienne A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2640-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 43Cooley J.W. Howitt C.A. Vermaas W.F. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As all three Rieske proteins in Synechocystis are sufficiently different (5Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Rogner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), various properties of the resulting proteins can also be expected in their physiological context, although the physiological functions of the petC gene family are elusive so far. In conclusion, our results show that PetC1 has a predominant function in the cytochrome b6f complex of Synechocystis PCC 6803, which can partly be taken over by PetC2. Although PetC3 also seems to have a specific function, the protein cannot replace PetC1 or PetC2 and may only operate in parallel to one of the two other Rieske proteins. Based on the presented data, it can be speculated that under normal physiological conditions PetC1 is the dominant Rieske isoform that can, under certain conditions, be replaced by PetC2, although at the expense of activity loss or decreasing cytochrome b6f complex activity. Independent of PetC1 and PetC2, PetC3 may have a specific physiological function within a small community of cytochrome b6f complexes, which is especially indicated by its much more negative redox potential. Although difficult due to its small amount in the membrane, this special role of PetC3 is still to be elucidated. We thank Sven Skrzypczak for help and advice and Ursula Altenfeld for excellent technical assistance."

Microbial Rhodopsins: Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity, Handbook of Photosensory Receptors. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2004Google Scholar). The SRI and SRII proteins transmit signals to their cognate transducer proteins, HtrI and HtrII, respectively, and like their eubacterial counterparts in chemotaxis, the Htr transducers control a histidine kinase and phosphoregulator protein that modulates motor function. Biochemical and spectroscopic studies have shown that there is close interaction between the SR and Htr components of the signaling complex both in the light and in the dark (1Hoff W.D. Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 223-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); i.e. they are subunits of a molecular complex. Furthermore, chimera experiments demonstrated that the interaction specificities of SRI with HtrI and SRII with HtrII are determined by the transmembrane helices of the Htr subunits (4Zhang X.N. Zhu J. Spudich J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cubic lipid phase crystal x-ray structures of SRII have defined the membrane-embedded and membrane-external portions of the transmembrane helices and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops of the protein (5Luecke H.

Moreover, co-crystallization of SRII with an N-terminal fragment of HtrII containing its two transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2) and a cytoplasmic extension of TM2 provided an atomic resolution structure by x-ray diffraction (7Gordeliy V.I.

The structure resolved extensive van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding contacts between HtrII TM2 (and to a lesser extent TM1) and SRII helices F and G within the membrane domain. The presence of the cytoplasmic membrane-proximal domain, comprised of 32 residues beyond Leu-82 at the membrane-cytoplasm interface, was necessary for high affinity binding of the HtrII fragment to SRII in detergent micelles used in the crystallization (7Gordeliy V.I.

Site-specific mutagenesis suggests that the HtrII membrane-proximal domain is critical for signaling. Cysteine-scanning through the length of TM2 from Ala-60 to Ala-88 showed that no single residue in the membrane-embedded portion is critical for phototaxis function (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also, as reported here, mutation of SRII Tyr-199 to Phe or to Ala, which eliminates a known hydrogen bond between the Tyr residue and an Asn residue on TM2 in the membrane domain, does not significantly impair signaling. In contrast, cysteine substitution of the first cytoplasmic residue (mutants HtrII-G83C and HtrII-G83F) completely eliminated phototaxis (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Functional importance of the transducer membrane-proximal domain has been more definitively demonstrated in the SRI transducer HtrI, which has been studied in greater detail with respect to physiological function by mutagenesis and biochemical analysis. A suppressor mutation analysis of randomly mutagenized SRI-HtrI complex revealed a cluster of functionally important residues ranging from positions 53 to 96 in HtrI (Asn-53 corresponds in HtrII to Leu-82 at the membrane/cytoplasm interface), and also 3 residues in the cytoplasmic regions of helices F and G of SRI (10Jung K.H. Spudich J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also a decreased phototaxis response occurs in HtrI-I64C (11Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19722-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, cytoplasmic extension of HtrI TM2 by 13 residues is necessary and sufficient for HtrI-dependent properties of SRI in the SRI-HtrI molecular complex, including the HtrI inhibition of opening of its proton-conducting cytoplasmic channel during the photocycle (12Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16095-16097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chen X. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42964-42969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Light-induced tilting of helix F (and to a lesser extent helix G) opens a cytoplasmic channel in BR (14Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and this tilting has been shown to occur in SRII both when free and bound to HtrII (15Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), with HtrII inhibiting the proton uptake through the channel as in the SRI-HtrI complex. This conformational change, which involves structural alterations mainly in the cytoplasmic end of helix F and in the E-F loop (14Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), has been proposed based on several lines of evidence to be responsible for activating the Htr transducers (17Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our goal in this work was to use fluorescent probe accessibility, FRET, and cysteine cross-linking to test (i) whether physical interaction in the cytoplasmic regions of SRII-HtrII occurs, (ii) whether there are conformational changes in the cytoplasmic E-F loop of SRII influenced by HtrII during photoactivation, and (iii) to investigate the importance of the HtrII cytoplasmic region for phototaxis signal transduction. Reagents—All buffers were purchased from either Fisher (Fairlawn, NJ) or Sigma. Lucifer yellow (LY) vinyl sulfone, l-cysteine, and N-ethylmaleimide were from Sigmal, and IAEDANS and Lucifer yellow iodoamine was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DDM was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH) and the Pfu DNA polymerase used in PCR reactions was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—HtrII was expressed using the pCY8 plasmid, whereas SRII was expressed using the pCY9 plasmid, constructed by PCR (18Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar). pCY8 was constructed by using pCY4 (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as template DNA and two primers: a forward primer Nco-004-F, which encodes a NcoI site in the beginning of the HtrII gene and a reverse primer CY8-his6-R contained the first 159 residues of HtrII and added six histidines in the C terminus followed by a HindIII site. The resulting NcoI-HindIII fragment was ligated with the large fragment of NcoI-HindIII-treated pET21d vector (Novagen) to produce pCY8. The pCY9 was constructed by PCR using a pJS005 (19Kunji E.R. Spudich E.N. Grisshammer R. Henderson R. Spudich J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as template DNA and a forward primer encoded the beginning of the sopII gene, which encodes the SRII apoprotein, and a reverse primer encoded the last five SRII residues followed by six histidines and a HindIII site. The resulting NcoI-HindIII fragment was ligated with a large fragment of the NcoI-HindIII-treated pET21d to produce pCY9. Single cysteine substitutions or single tryptophan substitutions in SRII and HtrII were constructed from the pCY8 or pCY9 plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis and each mutant was confirmed by sequencing. Protein Expression and Sample Preparation—BL21(DE3) cells containing SRII and HtrII were grown to an A600 = 0.4–0.5 at 37 °C before addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (plus 10 μm of all-trans-retinal for SRII expression). After 3 h the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,084 × g, 20 min) and suspended in buffer M (300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm MES, pH 6.8). After two freeze-thaw cycles and sonication (Sonifier 250, Branson, on power 5, duty cycle 40%, for 10 min), the unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation (7,093 × g, 30 min) and the crude membrane was collected by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C). The membrane fraction was solubilized in buffer M with 1% DDM (4 ml/liter culture) overnight at 4 °C on a mutator before ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C) to pellet insoluble membranes. The supernatant was then incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (1 ml/liter culture, from Qiagen) overnight, applied to a column, which washed extensively with 20 volumes of buffer (buffer M with 40 mm imidazole, 0.1% DDM, with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol added when purifying single cysteine mutant proteins), and the protein was eluted with 8 ml of this buffer with 100 and 200 mm imidazole. Reactivity of SRII Cysteine Mutants to LY—Wild type and mutant SRII and HtrII preparations were adjusted to a final concentration of 50 μm (1.2 mg/ml for SRII (“Free SRII”) and 0.9 mg/ml for HtrII) and 50 μl of SRII was taken and added to 50 μl of buffer M or 50 μl of buffer M with HtrII (“SRII-HtrII”). The 100-μl samples were then treated with 10 × 1-min bath sonication with 1-min intervals followed by 30 min incubation at room temperature for 30 min followed by reaction with 50-fold excess of LY (iodoamine form) for 300 min or the same volume of buffer M (control) in the dark or with 500 nm light illumination. Reactions were then quenched by the addition of l-cysteine to a final concentration of 2 mm and samples were injected into Slide-A-Lyzers (0.5 ml, Pierce) for dialysis against 2.5 liters of buffer M with 0.1% DDM overnight. Samples were removed and assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and absorption spectroscopy (CARY 4000 UV-visible Spectrophotometer, VARIAN). The absorption spectra of unlabeled samples were subtracted from the spectra of corresponding labeled sample. The absorbance corresponding to 100% labeling was calculated from the SRII concentration (ϵ498 = 40,000 cm-1m-1) and ϵ430 = 12,400 cm-1m-1 for LY. Fluorescent Probe Labeling for FRET Measurements—Labeling of SRII-S154C with IAEDANS was carried out by treating SRII-S154C protein (in buffer M) at room temperature for 16 h at a molar ratio of protein:IAEDANS = 1:30. Excess IAEDANS was removed by overnight dialysis against 250 volumes of buffer M with 0.1% DDM. For each single tryptophan mutant FRET measurement, three cuvettes were used: cuvette 1 contained IAEDANS-SRII-HtrII with a molecular ratio of 1:1, and cuvettes 2 and 3 contained the same concentration of IAE-DANS-SRII and HtrII, respectively, as in cuvette 1. Emission spectra from 300 to 520 nm with excitation at 280 nm were then measured. The emission change at 336 and 472 nm were calculated by subtracting the sum of emission spectra from cuvettes 2 and 3 from that of cuvette 1. The final values of emission changes for each mutant were determined by subtracting that observed at position 121 as background. Photocycle Measurements—Nd-YAG laser flash absorbance changes were acquired on a laboratory constructed flash spectrometer as described in the accompanying article (13Chen X. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42964-42969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Probe Labeling at Ser-154 SRII for SRII-HtrII Interaction Measurements—Labeling of SRII-S154C with vinyl sulfone was carried out by incubating SRII-S154C protein (in buffer M) at room temperature overnight at a molar ratio of protein:LY = 1:50. After excess LY was removed by overnight dialysis against 250 volumes of buffer M with 0.1% DDM, the concentration of labeled sample was determined. For fluorescence measurements (Hitachi F2000), all of the cuvettes were prepared to contain a final concentration of 4 μm LY-labeled SRII and different concentrations (0, 0.6, 1.1, 5.6 and 11.3 μm) of wild type or G83F-HtrII. After a 1-min on and off, for a total of 10 min, ultrasonic bath (with ice), all samples were allowed to sit in room temperature for 30 min before fluorescence emission readings at 520 nm (430 nm as excitation wavelength) were taken for each sample. Disulfide Bond Formation Assay—Cross-linking reactions were carried out as previously described (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All SRII and HtrII samples were adjusted to 10 μm with buffer M containing 0.1% DDM and cross-linking reactions were initialized with 3 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (in ethanol) and 1.5 mm CuSO4 for 3 min before being terminated by stop solution (2% SDS, 50 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 5 mm EDTA). The photoactivation group was subject to continuous illumination with 500 nm of light for 3 min before and during the reaction. All samples were then analyzed with 15% SDS-PAGE. Solvent-accessible Surface Area Calculations—Solvent-accessible surface areas (Å2) were calculated using MolMol 2K.2 for Linux (20Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) in SRII (Protein Data Bank codes 1JGJ and 1H2S). The probing size (solvent radius) was set to be 1.4 Å. Software—Curve fitting was performed with Prism 4.0 (Graphpad) and Origin Pro 7.0 (OriginLab). Protein sequence analysis used DNA Star V5.05 (Lasergen). Light Decreases the Accessibility of E-F Loop Position 154 in the SRII-HtrII Complex, but Not in Free SRII—As a first method to examine the effect of association with HtrII and of photoactivation on the SRII cytoplasmic loop structure, we measured fluorescent probe accessibilities of Cys residues introduced at 8 cytoplasmic surface residues (1 on the A-B, 1 on the C-D, and 6 on the E-F loop) of SRII. Reactivities of the single cysteine SRII mutants were measured in HtrII-free SRII and HtrII-complexed SRII 2The N-terminal fragment of HtrII consisting of residues 1–159 is used exclusively in the in vitro measurements. After its initial designation as HtrII-(1–159), we refer to it as HtrII for simplicity. Thus, the in vitro“SRII-HtrII” complex in this article designates the “NpSRII-NpHtrII-(1–159)” complex in more complete notation. The entire HtrII protein for clarity is designated as “full-length HtrII.” in the dark and light. The accessibilities in the dark of the residues on the A-B and C-D loops were unaffected by the presence of HtrII, whereas HtrII reduced the accessibility at 3 positions on the E-F loop (151, 154, and 158), position 154 most strongly (Fig. 1). Surface area calculations from the crystal structures of HtrII-free SRII (5Luecke H. Schobert B. Lanyi J.K. Spudich E.N. Spudich J.L. Science. 2001; 293: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and SRII bound to a 114-residue HtrII N-terminal fragment (7Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) predict nearly equal or greater accessibility in the HtrII-bound SRII at these 3 positions (134, 96, and 47 Å2 for free SRII at positions 151, 154, and 158, respectively, and 155, 92, and 49 Å2 for the same positions in HtrII-complexed SRII). Therefore, the reduced accessibilities suggest an effect of the unseen presence of HtrII residues in this region (i.e. residues present but unresolved in the crystal structure of the complex), which inhibit access to the probe. Probe accessibilities of the single cysteine SRII mutants were then measured under 500 nm illumination in free SRII and HtrII-complexed SRII. In free SRII, none of the positions exhibit significant changes in accessibility upon photoactivation (Fig. 2), confirming the logic of this approach because the residues were selected for the property of protruding outward into the cytoplasm in the crystal structure and therefore should be relatively insensitive to structural perturbations. However, in the presence of HtrII, photoactivation caused a decrease of 40% labeling efficiency in residue S154C in SRII and smaller but significant changes in S158C and L159C (Fig. 2). We conclude that there is an influence of HtrII on the light-induced structural change of SRII or on its consequence in the E-F loop at position 154, and to a lesser extent positions 158 and 159. S154C shows the largest decrease of labeling efficiency in the dark as well as the largest HtrII-dependent effect of light activation. These results strongly suggest that HtrII residues are physically near Ser-154 in the dark and the residues interact with Ser-154 upon light activation of the receptor, further hindering probe access. To test this possibility further and to localize the region of interaction in HtrII, we examined whether Trp residues introduced into the membrane-proximal domain would be within energy-transferring distances from a fluorescent probe attached to SRII-S154C. Tryptophans Placed within a Short Region in the HtrII Membrane-proximal Domain Exhibit Förster Resonance Energy Transfer to a Fluorescent Probe at Position 154 in SRII—We constructed a series of single Trp substitutions at HtrII residue positions 87–95, and at 121. HtrII-(1–159) does not contain native Trp residue, hence the substitutions result in single Trp HtrII mutants. The 87–95 region was chosen based on its projected location at a similar distance from the membrane as Ser-154 in SRII (assuming an α-helical extension of TM2 roughly perpendicular to the membrane), and position 121 was selected as a negative control because it is expected to be well beyond interaction distances from the SRII cytoplasmic domain. In complex with SRII-S154C labeled with IAEDANS (Fig. 3), the single Trp mutants exhibited energy transfer from HtrII positions 91–95 with a peak at position 93. No energy transfer was observed from positions 87–89 nor from the Trp at 121. Our interpretation is that the region near Ser-154 of SRII interacts with the 91–95 region of HtrII. FRET Is Eliminated by the Signaling-deficient HtrII Mutant G83F without Loss of Affinity for SRII—To test for a relationship of the FRET-detected proximity of SRII and HtrII to function, we repeated the FRET measurements with the function-deficient mutant HtrII-G83F. FRET is eliminated in this mutant (Fig. 3), and therefore it became critical to determine whether the binding affinity, presumably determined by the extensive interactions between the SRII and HtrII transmembrane domains, was altered by the mutation. To evaluate the SRII-HtrII binding constant in 0.1% DDM as used in the FRET assays, we applied two different methods. The first was based on an assay developed by Kamo and co-workers (21Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2002; 67: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that the photocycle of SRII-D75N was affected by the binding of HtrII and thus, flash photolysis of SRII-D75N can be used to determine its affinity for HtrII. The kinetics of the flash-induced absorption change at 570 nm in free SRII-D75N and that of SRII-D75N complexed with HtrII (Fig. 4A) shows that association with transducer resulted in changes in both the relative amplitudes and the rates of kinetic components in the photocycle of the SRII. We used the full amplitude of the differential signal (Fig. 4A, inset) to assess the extent of binding. Based on the concentration dependence effect of HtrII on the photocycle of SRII-D75N (Fig. 4B), the Kd was determined to be 0.35 μm under our conditions. Similar measurement with HtrII-G83F produced a Kd of 0.22 μm. These values are close to the affinities measured in previous reports (8Hippler-Mreyen S. Klare J.P. Wegener A.A. Seidel R. Herrmann C. Schmies G. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Engelhard M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1203-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Sudo Y. Iwamoto M. Shimono K. Kamo N. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2002; 67: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and show that the G83F mutation does not significantly inhibit HtrII binding to SRII-D75N. Because the above measurement used SRII-D75N, whereas the FRET measurements used SRII-S154C, we applied a second method using the fluorescent probe LY vinyl sulfone attached to SRII-S154C as a fluorescent reporter group for the binding of HtrII. LY has been used successfully in several studies to report protein conformational changes (22Yang C.S. Skiba N.P. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or protein association (23Skiba N.P. Yang C.S. Huang T. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8770-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). LY-labeled SRII-S154C was divided into several different aliquots with equal volumes and different concentrations of HtrII (Fig. 4C) or HtrII-G83F (Fig. 4D) were added. Both wild type HtrII and HtrII-G83F cause an increase in the LY fluorescence signal and the saturation curves are identical, confirming that the mutation does not inhibit binding. Therefore the loss of FRET between SRII-S154C-IAE-DANS and Trp residues in HtrII-G83F is not because of loss of association and results instead from a change in HtrII structure evidently distancing the protein in the cytoplasmic region from SRII. SRII and HtrII Reciprocally Inhibit Disulfide Cross-linking Reactions in Their Membrane-proximal Domains—Two additional experiments were designed to test for physical interaction in the membrane-proximal domains of SRII-HtrII. First, disulfide cross-linking reactions of SRII-S150C and SRII-S154C were carried out with or without HtrII (Fig. 5A). The cross-linking efficiency at S150C was not affected by the presence of HtrII, whereas the cross-linking in S154C was abolished by association with HtrII. This result supports the fluorescent probe labeling data at Ser-150 and Ser-154, only the latter of which showed a significant decrease in labeling when complexed with HtrII, and provide further evidence for proximity of SRII and HtrII in the membrane-proximal region. The converse experiment was performed to test whether SRII would inhibit disulfide cross-linking of the mono-Cys mutant HtrII-L90C. The presence of SRII reduced the cross-linking efficiency of L90C and was further decreased when SRII was photoactivated (Fig. 5B). These results further indicate the existence of close proximity between SRII-HtrII in the membrane-proximal domain, and in addition, suggest that the contact is enhanced when the receptor is photoactivated, in agreement with the accessibility data. The results above (i) provide compelling evidence for close proximity of E-F cytoplasmic loop residue Ser-154 in SRII to residues 91–95 in the HtrII membrane-proximal domain, (ii) show that SRII photoactivation alters the interaction in this region, and (iii) correlate the loss of interaction with the loss of function in HtrII mutant G83F. The results suggest a model in which the crystallographically demonstrated (7Gordeliy V.I. Labahn J. Moukhametzianov R. Efremov R. Granzin J. Schlesinger R. Buldt G. Savopol T. Scheidig A.J. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Nature. 2002; 419: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) tight interactions between SRII and HtrII membrane-embedded domains hold the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor and transducer in close juxtaposition, and SRII photoactivation, which is believed to cause an outward displacement of helix F (15Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that would in turn be expected to alter the structure of the E-F loop, alters the interaction in the membrane-proximal region during the signal relay process (Fig. 6). Site-directed spin labeling measurements revealed a light-induced transient decrease of nitroxide mobility in SRII S158C-R1 which faces HtrII TM2 (where R1 indicates the spin label attached to the Cys residue) and an increase in mobility of the probe attached at L159C, which faces away from TM2 on helix F. These results were interpreted as a movement of the helix toward TM2 of HtrII during activation (15Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This movement fits well with the model suggested here. Ser-154 is 2 helical turns below Ser-158 facing in the same direction and the HtrII-(91–95) region is on the cytoplasmic extension of TM2. Assuming a similar structural change in SRII as in light-activated BR, the proposed motion of Ser-154 toward HtrII-(91–95) residues would entail tilting of helix F from Pro-175 in the membrane-embedded portion of SRII, and would require the Ser-158/Leu-159 motion. Cysteine scanning through the length of TM2 from Ala-60 to Ala-88 showed that no single residue in the membrane-embedded SRI-HtrI interface is critical for phototaxis function (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of SRII Tyr-199 to Phe or Ala, which eliminates a known hydrogen bond between the Tyr residue and an Asn residue on TM2 in the membrane domain, does not significantly impair phototaxis signaling assessed by computerized cell tracking (data not shown). In contrast to this permissive property of the SRI-HtrI interface within the bilayer, mutation of HtrII Gly-83 to Cys or Phe causes a total loss of phototaxis responses in H. salinarum (9Yang C.S. Spudich J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14207-14214Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Gly-83 is the first residue beyond the membrane-cytoplasm interface in HtrII and begins the sequence Gly-Gly-Asp-Thr, which protein structure analysis (Fig. 6) predicts to be a turn and a flexible region. Also, a second turn and flexible region is predicted at positions 101–104, which would serve to bring the two post-turn helices of the HtrII monomers together in the coiled coil dimer motif expected from sequence algorithms for HtrII (11Zhang X.N. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19722-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and observed in the homologous Tsr transducer (24Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In the model (Fig. 7), elimination of the turn at the membrane-cytoplasm interface by mutation of Gly-83 would result in loss of the proper interaction in the cytoplasmic 90–95 position stretch and hence account for loss of phototaxis signaling. Several lines of evidence (15Wegener A.A. Chizhov I. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 881-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Wegener A.A. Klare J.P. Engelhard M. Steinhoff H.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5312-5319Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Spudich J.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) indicate that SRII undergoes a light-induced conformational change similar to that of BR, which undergoes a rotation and outward tilting of helix F and associated movement of the E-F loop (25Rink T. Pfeiffer M. Oesterhelt D. Gerwert K. Steinhoff H.J. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1519-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Xiao W. Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The results from Ser-154 labeling reported here confirm the movement of the E-F loop upon SRII photoactivation. For BR the conformational change has been resolved by cryoelectron crystallography (14Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and most of the movement occurs in the cytoplasmic region when comparing the “closed” and “open” states (Fig. 7). Because SRII has a very similar structure to that of BR, in Fig. 7 SRII in the SRII-HtrII complex structure was replaced with the structure of the BR open state to visualize possible interaction with HtrII during the SRII conformational change. The conformational changes in helix F and G and the E-F loop are substantial in the cytoplasmic region, and are therefore likely to induce movement of the 91–95 region of HtrII shown here to be in close proximity to the E-F loop. A stretch of 5 residues on the HtrI membrane-proximal domain (positions 62–66) blocks or prevents opening of the cytoplasmic proton-conducting channel during the photocycle of transducer-free SRI (13Chen X.

It is very likely that SRI undergoes a similar conformational movement of helix F and the E-F loop as do BR and SRII. Aligning HtrI and HtrII shows that positions 62–66 in HtrI correspond to positions 91–95 in HtrII, the interacting 5-residue region revealed in our FRET analysis of the SRII-HtrII complex. The evidence for receptor interaction in the corresponding 5-residue stretch in HtrI obtained by a completely different method in the accompanying article (13Chen X. Spudich J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42964-42969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) further strengthens the conclusions here, and argues for a similar coupling between SRI and HtrI as we observe for SRII and HtrII. Conformational change in the cytoplasmic E-F loop upon light-activation appears to be a common feature among seven transmembrane photoreceptors. In BR, the conformational change in helix F and the E-F loop occur in the proton pumping cycle (27Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. J. Mol.

L6/Shcas myoblasts showed marked reduction of the p66Shc protein isoform and no change in p52Shc or p46Shc proteins compared with control myoblasts transfected with the empty vector (L6/Neo). When compared with control, L6/Shcas myoblasts demonstrated 3-fold increase in Erk-1/2 phosphorylation under basal conditions and blunted Erk-1/2 stimulation by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), in the absence of changes in total Erk-1/2 protein levels. Increased basal Erk-1/2 activation was paralleled by a greater proportion of phosphorylated Erk-1/2 in the nucleus of L6/Shcas myoblasts in the absence of IGF-I stimulation. The reduction of p66Shc in L6/Shcas myoblasts resulted in marked phenotypic abnormalities, such as rounded cell shape and clustering in islets or finger-like structures, and was associated with impaired DNA synthesis in response to IGF-I and lack of terminal differentiation into myotubes. In addition, L6/Shcas myoblasts were characterized by complete disruption of actin filaments and cell cytoskeleton. Treatment of L6/Shcas myoblasts with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduced the abnormal increase in Erk-1/2 activation to control levels and restored the actin cytoskeleton, re-establishing the normal cell morphology. Thus, the p66Shc isoform exerts an inhibitory effect on the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in rodent myoblasts, which is necessary for maintenance of IGF responsiveness of the MEK/Erk pathway and normal cell phenotype.

Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle cells also synthesize and secrete IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-binding proteins, providing a cell model for integrated autocrine and paracrine control of mitogenic and metabolic actions by the IGFs. IGF signaling in skeletal muscle involves activation of specific cell surface receptors, containing a tyrosine kinase domain within their cytoplasmic portion and undergoing autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues upon ligand binding. Receptor autophosphorylation triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular substrate proteins, including IRS-1, IRS-2, Crk-II, and the Shc proteins (4LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 5LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1287-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Shc proteins are widely expressed signaling mediators that are tyrosine-phosphorylated by multiple receptor or receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and are capable of stimulating the Ras/MAP kinase pathway after binding to the Grb2 adaptor (6Egan S.E.

Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Shc proteins originate by alternative use of three distinct translation starting points on a longer transcript (p42Shc, p52Shc, and p66Shc) and of two translation starting points on a shorter transcript (p46Shc and p52Shc); the two mRNA transcripts are generated by alternative splicing from a single gene and are regulated by distinct promoters (8Pelicci G.

As a consequence, p66Shc contains the entire sequence of p46Shc and p52Shc, with one phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, one src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and one collagen homology (CH1) region. In addition, p66Shc has a second CH2 domain of 110 amino acids, located at the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule, that is not present in p46Shc or p52Shc. Recent reports have established a specific role for the p66Shc isoform. p46Shc and p52Shc are found in every cell type with similar reciprocal relationship, whereas p66Shc expression varies from cell type to cell type and is also lacking in some cell types (8Pelicci G.

Evidence for divergent regulation of p66Shcversus p46/p52Shc has emerged from studies that demonstrated specific serine phosphorylation of p66Shc through an MEK-mediated pathway in response to insulin (11Kao A.W. Waters S.B. Okada S. Pessin J.E. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2474-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Knock-out experiments, in which the p66Shc gene has been selectively inactivated in mice, suggest an important role of this protein in the regulation of cellular responses to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and life span (12Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 13Napoli C. Martin-Padura I. de Nigris F.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways mediating the unique actions of p66Shc remain to be established. The mitogenic and survival signals evoked by the IGFs have been extensively studied in multiple cell types, including skeletal muscle cells. Activation of the MEK/Erk pathway in response to the IGFs appears to mediate myoblast growth and differentiation (14Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 15Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). IGF-I stimulation of DNA synthesis is blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (16Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and myotubes do not survive or differentiate when the MEK/Erk pathway is similarly blocked by PD98059 (17Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, augmentation of IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation in dexamethasone-treated L6 myoblasts is associated with increased Shc and decreased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation (18Giorgino F. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Giorgino F. Pedrini M.T. Matera L. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7455-7463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), suggesting that under conditions of glucocorticoid excess the mitogenic response of muscle cells to the IGFs can be modulated by altering the activity of the Shc/Erk pathway. The specific contribution of the p66Shc isoform to IGF-I action on skeletal muscle cells has not been investigated. In this study, we show that selective reduction of p66Shc in L6 skeletal muscle cells results in up-regulation of the MEK/Erk pathway, leading to increased Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear localization in the absence of IGF-I stimulation. This is associated with a dramatic perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to abnormal cell shape, growth, and differentiation of the L6 myoblasts. The abnormalities in both signaling reactions and organization of the actin cytoskeleton are corrected by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that in skeletal muscle cells the p66Shc isoform may physiologically exert an inhibitory role on MEK/Erk, which is necessary for full responsiveness of this signaling pathway to the IGFs and maintenance of normal cell morphology. Cell Culture—L6 rat skeletal muscle myoblasts were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% donor calf bovine serum (BCS) (both from Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes with 2% horse serum (Invitrogen), 2 nm triiodothyronine (Sigma), and 20 nm insulin. For IGF-I studies, cells were incubated in complete medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) without calf bovine serum for 16 h, and then stimulated with 100 nm IGF-I (GRO PEP, Adelaide, Australia) for the indicated times or left untreated. To block the MEK/Erk signaling pathway, cells were incubated with 20 μm PD98059 (Calbiochem, Merck KGaA) for the indicated times. Antibodies—A monoclonal phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) and polyclonal IGF-I R β-subunit (C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal MEK-1/2, phospho-MEK-1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and phospho-p42/44 MAP kinase (Erk-1/2) (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal and monoclonal Shc antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A monoclonal MAP kinase (Erk-1/2) antibody was from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). A monoclonal vinculin antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich. Transfection Studies—To generate L6 myoblasts stably expressing reduced levels of the p66Shc isoform, a 287-bp fragment of the cDNA encoding the p52/p46Shc proteins (from nucleotide 55 to nucleotide 342), indicated as as1, was generated by amplification using the pMJ/Shc plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger, New York, NY) as a template. A 326-nucleotide cDNA fragment corresponding to the NH2-terminal 109 amino acids unique to p66Shc, indicated as as2, was generated by PCR amplification using the rat p66Shc cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. J. E. Pessin, New York, NY). To generate stable transfectants, the cDNAs of interest were cloned in antisense orientation into the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), containing a G418 resistance gene, under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The as1- and as2-containing plasmids were transfected into L6 myoblasts by liposome-mediated gene transfer using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants, indicated as L6/Shcas1 and L6/Shcas2, were selected by their ability to grow in neomycin-containing medium. Multiple stable clones of L6 cells hypoexpressing Shc were obtained within 4 weeks. Plasmid integration into the cell genome was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic DNA with forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the pCR3.1 (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′) and Shc (5′-CTG GCA CAG TGG CCC TGT CCA TCC-3′) sequences, respectively. The amount of Shc protein expressed in transfected L6 myoblasts was determined by immunoblotting total cell lysates with Shc antibodies, as previously described (18Giorgino F. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For immunoprecipitation studies, L6 skeletal muscle cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS and then scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was collected and assayed for protein concentration using the Bradford dye binding assay kit with BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of cellular proteins (500 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were adsorbed onto 70 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then eluted with Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. For immunoblotting studies, equal amounts of cellular proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as appropriate, directly or following immunoprecipitation with the specific antibodies, as indicated. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences) using a transfer buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, and 0.02% SDS. To reduce nonspecific binding, the membranes were incubated in TNA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.9% NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide) supplemented with 5% BSA and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 2 h at 37 °C, or in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 3% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature, as appropriate, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometric analysis using Optilab® image analysis software (Graftek SA, Mirmande, France). Immunofluorescence Analyses—To visualize the actin cytoskeleton, L6 cells were grown on coverslips in complete medium for the indicated times, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized at -20 °C with 100% methanol. Fixed cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC) phalloidin (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min and subsequently washed three times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Gel mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Fluorescence signals were detected by conventional epifluorescence microscopy (Leica DMLB microscope with a Sensicam 12 Bitled charge-coupled device camera, Bansheim, Germany), and all images were captured at the same magnification. To examine vinculin-containing focal adhesions, L6 cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Incubation with primary antibody against vinculin (1:400) was conducted at room temperature for 16 h, followed by incubation with secondary Alexa488 Fluor anti-mouse goat antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h and washing three times with PBS. Cells were finally stained with TO-PRO-3 (1:10,000, Molecular Probes) to visualize nuclei, and coverslips were mounted using Gel Mount (Biomeda). Images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland), and all images were taken at the same magnification. To study the intracellular localization of Erk-1/2, L6 cells were grown on glass slides, arrested at 50% confluence in serum-free medium for 24 h, and then incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm IGF-I for 30 min. To assess total Erk-1/2, control and IGF-I-treated cells were fixed with methanol/acetone (70:30, v/v) for 10 min at -20 °C. After a 10-min rehydration with multiple PBS washes at 25 °C, the cells were blocked with PBS/10% BCS for 45 min and then incubated with the monoclonal MAP kinase antibody in PBS/10% BCS (1:100) for 60 min at 25 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies in PBS/10% BCS (1:100) for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark. To evaluate the localization of phospho-Erk-1/2, control and IGF-I-treated cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 100% methanol for 5 min at -20 °C. After a 10-min rehydration with multiple PBS washes at 25 °C, cells were blocked with blocking buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Tris-buffered saline 1×, TBST) supplemented with 5.5% BCS for 45 min, and then incubated with the polyclonal phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody in Tris-buffered saline 1× (TBS) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl/3% BSA (1:100) for 60 min at 25 °C. Cells were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies in TBST/3% BSA (1:100) for 60 min at 25 °C in the dark. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS, mounted under glass coverslips with CITIFLUOR medium, examined under epifluorescent illumination with excitation-emission filters for FITC by epifluorescence microscopy (Leica DMRXA microscope), and photographed with an Olympus inverted microscope equipped with phase-contrast and UV illumination through an FITC filter. Thymidine Incorporation—Thymidine incorporation was carried out as previously described (18Giorgino F. Smith R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, L6 cells were grown in 35-mm multiwell plates to ∼50% confluence in MEM with 10% BCS. Following incubation in serum-free MEM for 16 h, L6 myoblasts were incubated with or without 100 nm IGF-I for 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in fresh MEM containing 0.2% BSA, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), and 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, left in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice, and washed twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were then solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of 3H was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. For each condition, experiments were carried out in triplicate. Statistical Analyses—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data are expressed as percentage of control or basal control values, as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed by unpaired Student's t tests. Generation of L6 Skeletal Muscle Myoblasts with Reduced p66Shc Protein Levels—To determine the specific contribution of the p66Shc isoform to IGF-I action and signaling in skeletal muscle cells, the cellular levels of this IGF-I receptor substrate were selectively reduced by expressing specific Shc antisense RNA sequences. For this purpose, undifferentiated L6 skeletal muscle cells were stably transfected with two independent Shc antisense sequences, designated as1 and as2. as1 represents a 287-nucleotide cDNA fragment corresponding to both the p46/p52Shc and p66Shc mRNA transcripts, whereas as2 represents a 326-nucleotide cDNA fragment specific to the NH2-terminal 109 amino acids unique to the p66Shc mRNA transcript (Fig. 1A). Independent clones of L6 cells showing decreased expression of p66Shc were identified by immunoblotting with anti-Shc antibodies and selected for further analyses. Both as1 and as2 induced a marked and selective reduction in p66Shc protein levels in multiple clones of L6 myoblasts (Fig. 1, B and C). as1 decreased the p66Shc protein ∼90% compared with untransfected wild-type L6 myoblasts (p < 0.05) or L6/Neo myoblasts transfected with the empty pCR3.1 vector. By contrast, the protein levels of the other Shc isoforms, i.e. p52Shc and p46Shc, were not significantly different in L6/Shcas1, L6/Neo, and untransfected L6 myoblasts (Fig. 1B). A 65% reduction in p66Shc was obtained following overexpression of the as2 cDNA construct (p < 0.05), which also did not affect p52Shc or p46Shc protein levels (Fig. 1C). Therefore, L6 skeletal muscle cell lines with marked reduction of p66Shc were established by stable transfection of as1 or as2. The selective inhibition of p66Shc expression in the absence of changes in expression levels of the other Shc isoforms may be potentially explained by different sensitivity to antisense-mediated inhibition of protein translation of the two mRNA transcripts encoding the Shc proteins (8Pelicci G.

Therefore, both as1 and as2 interfere with the mRNA transcript encoding p66Shc, whereas the mRNA transcript encoding p46/52Shc may be resistant to interference by as1 (Fig. 1A). Erk-1/2 Signaling in L6/Shcas Myoblasts—The Shc proteins regulate cellular responses through activation of the Grb2/Sos/Ras signaling cascade, leading to phosphorylation and activation of the MAP kinase family members Erk-1 and Erk-2. To verify whether selective reduction of the p66Shc protein levels could modify this signaling pathway, we analyzed basal and IGF-I-induced Erk-1/2 phosphorylation in L6/Shcas1 and L6/Shcas2 myoblasts with decreased p66Shc protein levels. Activation of Erk-1 and Erk-2 was evaluated by immunoblotting with phospho-Erk-1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies in two independent clones of L6/Shcas1 myoblasts (C6 and D28) and two independent clones of L6/Shcas2 myoblasts (E15 and E21). In the L6/Shcas1 clones, basal Erk-1 and Erk-2 phosphorylation was increased 411 and 360% of control, respectively (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A). By contrast, basal phosphorylation of Erk-1 and Erk-2 was similar in L6 myoblasts transfected with the empty vector (L6/Neo, clones N1 and N5) and in untransfected wild-type L6 myoblasts (respectively, p = 0.32 and p = 0.97), indicating that plasmid transfection and clonal selection in neomycin-containing medium did not affect the level of Erk phosphorylation. No change in total Erk-1 or Erk-2 protein content was evident in wild-type L6, L6/Neo, and L6/Shcas1 myoblasts (Fig. 2A). Increased phosphorylation of Erk isoforms in the basal state was also evident in two independent clones of L6/Shcas2 myoblasts compared with control (Fig. 2B; p < 0.05), although this change was of lower magnitude (i.e. 280 and 200% increases of Erk-1 and Erk-2 phosphorylation, respectively, in clones E15 and E21 versus control) as compared with that seen in L6/Shcas1 myoblasts. Total protein content of Erk-1 and Erk-2 was slightly and not significantly increased in L6/Shcas2 compared with control myoblasts (Fig. 2B). Therefore, stable overexpression of either as1 or as2 in L6 myoblasts results in decreased p66Shc content and increased phosphorylation of Erk-1 and Erk-2 not due to changes in total Erk protein content. L6/Shcas1 myoblasts were used in subsequent studies, because they showed greater decrease in p66Shc protein levels and more prominent increase in Erk-1/2 phosphorylation as compared with L6/Shcas2 myoblasts. To assess the responsiveness of Erk-1/2 phosphorylation to IGF-I stimulation, control and L6/Shcas myoblasts were treated with 100 nm IGF-I for various times and subjected to immunoblotting with phospho-Erk-1/2 antibodies. In control L6/Neo cells, IGF-I markedly increased phosphorylation of both Erk isoforms, which was evident after 3 min of stimulation, peaked at 5 min, and remained sustained up to 30 min (Fig. 2C). By contrast, Erk-1/2 phosphorylation was elevated in the basal state in L6/Shcas myoblasts and showed no further increase during IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 2C). Activation of Erk-1/2 following phosphorylation on Thr-202/Tyr-204 results in translocation of the phosphorylated kinases from the cytoplasm, where they are normally retained presumably via a cytoplasmic anchoring complex, to the nucleus (20Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To investigate the intracellular localization of activated Erk-1/2 in myoblasts with reduced p66Shc levels, L6/Shcas cells were studied by immunofluorescence using antibodies to total or phosphorylated Erk-1/2 and compared with control. In control L6 myoblasts, Erk-1/2 appeared uniformly distributed in the cell cytoplasm under basal conditions. IGF-I stimulation induced an increase in the Erk-1/2 signal in the cell nucleus and perinuclear region (Fig. 3A). Increased nuclear fluorescence in IGF-I-treated cells was also observed using antibodies to phosphorylated Erk-1/2 (Fig. 3B), indicating IGF-I-dependent nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form of Erk-1/2. As compared with control cells, L6/Shcas myoblasts showed a greater amount of Erk-1/2 in their nucleus already in the basal state, which did not augment upon IGF-I stimulation (Fig. 3A). The nuclear Erk-1/2 in the unstimulated L6/Shcas myoblasts was constitutively phosphorylated, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence with phospho-Erk-1/2 antibodies (Fig. 3B). Thus, L6/Shcas myoblasts show constitutive activation and nuclear translocation of Erk-1/2 proteins in the absence of IGF-I stimulation. IGF-I exerts a dual effect on proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells, which relies upon an intact Erk-1/2 responsiveness to this growth factor (16Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R.

Because Erk activation was altered in L6/Shcas compared with control L6 myoblasts, IGF-I effects on DNA synthesis and cell differentiation were next determined. In untransfected L6 and L6/Neo myoblasts IGF-I stimulation resulted in a 3-fold increase in DNA synthesis, measured by determining the rates of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA (p < 0.05 versus basal) (Fig. 4A). By contrast, in L6/Shcas myoblasts the IGF-I effect on DNA synthesis was modest and statistically not significant (Fig. 4A). Differentiation into myotubes, which is largely mediated by IGFs secreted in an autocrine manner (3Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar), was also impaired in the L6/Shcas myoblasts. Both wild-type L6 and L6/Neo myoblasts became elongated and fused to form the characteristic multinucleated myotubes when grown in the differentiation medium (Fig. 4B). By contrast, L6/Shcas myoblasts showed elongation and some degree of alignment, but did not develop into myotubes (Fig. 4B). IGF-I Receptor Signaling in L6/Shcas Myoblasts—The constitutive activation of Erk in the absence of IGF-I stimulation in myoblasts with reduced p66Shc levels could potentially result from increased activity of steps in the IGF-I signaling cascade upstream of Erk.

In addition, Dvl and Axin can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK via distinct mechanisms, through interaction with MEKK1/4 and Rac GTPase, respectively. Axin utilizes two distinct domains for interaction with MEKK1 and MEKK4. JNK activation by Axin is regulated by several factors in the Wnt pathway, whereas little is known about cross-regulation of Dvl-mediated JNK activation. In the present study, we have investigated whether Ccd1 could play a regulatory role in Axin- and Dvl-mediated JNK activation. Here we show that Ccd1 drastically inhibited JNK activation both by Axin and by Dvl. Although DIX domains are sufficient for dimer formation between Dvl and Ccd1, Ccd1 also required its coiled-coil domain for inhibition of JNK activation by Dvl. Interestingly, Rac remained associated with Dvl heterodimerized with Ccd1. How Ccd1 blocks Rac/Dvl signaling to JNK is unclear. In contrast, Axin, when complexed with Ccd1, did not bind to MEKK1. Furthermore, Ccd1 physically interacted with MEKK4 in their physiological concentrations and prevented MEKK4 from binding to Axin. Reduction of Ccd1 protein by small interfering RNA could elevate JNK signaling as assayed with an AP1-dependent transcriptional reporter. We have therefore demonstrated that Ccd1 inhibits Axin-mediated JNK activation by simultaneously adopting two distinct mechanisms, one through conformational changes that disallow MEKK1 binding and the other via direct sequestration of MEKK4.

The Wnt signaling pathway is one of the major developmental signaling pathways regulating important processes such as cell proliferation, polarity, and specification of cell fate (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar, 2Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In this pathway, Dvl is an intracellular protein and transduces signals from the Wnt receptor frizzled to Axin through heterodimer formation via the DIX domain (6Li L. Yuan H. Weaver C.D. Mao J. Farr G.H. Sussman D.J. Jonkers J. Kimelman D. Wu D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Axin forms a multimeric protein complex with, in addition to Dvl, adenomatous polyposis coli, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and β-catenin (7Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I.

This complex enhances phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3β and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin (10Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Ccd1, a recently identified protein with a DIX domain, is a positive regulator in the Wnt signaling pathway during zebrafish neural patterning (5Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It functions downstream of the Wnt receptor and upstream of Axin. Ccd1 can activate T-cell factors-dependent transcription in a transient transfection reporter assay. Cotransfection of the full-length Ccd1 resulted in TOPtkLuciferase reporter transcriptional activation comparable with the activation by Dvl expression. Overexpression of Ccd1 in zebrafish embryos caused a reduction in the size of the eyes and forebrain, which is similar to the phenotype of excessive activation of Wnt signaling by overexpression of Wnt8 or its receptor in zebrafish. Ccd1 also possesses a coiled-coil domain, deletion of which enables Ccd1 to function as a dominant-negative suppressor downstream of Wnt receptor activation. The molecular mechanism underlying how Ccd1 exerts its positive role in Wnt signaling is not clear. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Ccd1 forms homodimers via its DIX domain and coiled-coil domain and heterodimeric complexes with Dvl via their DIX domains. It is likely that Ccd1 regulates the Wnt signaling through its association with Axin and Dvl or by modulating the interaction between Axin and Dvl. It is interesting that Axin and Dvl both activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SPAK) when overexpressed in a variety of cells even though they utilize different mechanisms for JNK activation (12Zhang Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2610-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In particular, Axin requires several structural aspects to activate JNK (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Rui H.L. Fan E. Zhou H.M. Xu Z. Zhang Y. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

The MEKK1 or MEKK4 binding domain combines with a domain of unknown nature (domain X), DIX homodimerization domain, and the extreme C-terminal sumoylation motifs to activate JNK. In addition to its well established role in Wnt signaling, Dvl also exerts a critical role in the generation of epithelial planar polarity in Drosophila, which depends on its ability to activate JNK (13Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Although MEKK1/4 play essential roles in Axin-mediated JNK activation (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.-H. Ye Z.Y. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Dvl instead seems to form a complex with the small GTPase Rac via its C-terminal DEP domain upon Wnt/Fz signaling (18Habas R. Dawid I.B. He X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and activates MKK7 in the Dvl/JNK pathway (19Moriguchi T. Kawachi K. Kamakura S. Masuyama N. Yamanaka H. Matsumoto K. Kikuchi A. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30957-30962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An intriguing property of Axin in JNK activation is that its conformation for MEKK1 binding is highly regulated. Upon binding to Axin, the Wnt signaling components glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinase Iα/ϵ inhibit Axin-mediated JNK activation by preventing MEKK1 binding to Axin (14Zhang Y. Qiu W.-J. Liu D.-X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Chan S.C. Han J. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It should be noted here that glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinase Iα/ϵ both bind to domains outside the MEKK1 binding site, underscoring involvement of conformational changes in differential Axin complex formations. We found previously that Axin-mediated JNK activation is antagonized by Dvl heterodimer formation through its DIX domains (21Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dvl-DIX and Dvl-ΔDEP proteins, both of which contain the DIX domain and are deficient for JNK activation, can attenuate Axin-induced JNK activation by abolishing Axin homodimerization. In the present study, we asked whether Ccd1, the novel DIX protein that plays a positive role in Wnt signaling, could also modulate JNK activation by Axin as well as Dvl. We have generated a full-length human Ccd1 protein expression construct using the KIAA1735 clone and a series of deletion mutants. It was revealed here that Ccd1 inhibited JNK activation by Axin and Dvl. Although DIX domains are sufficient for Dvl and Ccd1 to form a dimer, the coiled-coil domain of Ccd1 is also required for its inhibition of JNK activation by Dvl. Interestingly, Ccd1, Dvl, and Rac form a ternary complex when coexpressed in the cell, suggesting that Ccd1·Dvl in the complex prevented Rac from being activated or activating downstream effectors. We unexpectedly found that Axin utilizes a novel domain rather than its DIX domain to interact with Ccd1, pointing to diverse interaction patterns among DIX proteins. Moreover, we found that Ccd1 binding to Axin prevented MEKK1 binding to the Axin complex and that Ccd1 itself formed a complex with MEKK4 and rendered it unable to contact Axin directly. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Ccd1 inhibits Axin-mediated JNK activation by simultaneously competing against MEKK1 binding and sequestration of MEKK4. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium as described previously (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

Karin (University of California San Diego), which were generated as described previously (22Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Construction of Plasmids—The human full-length Ccd1 cDNA was released from a KIAA1735 cDNA clone generously provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. It was Myc-, HA-, or FLAG-tagged at its N terminus, which was made possible by introducing an NdeI restriction site into the start codon by PCR amplification of the 5′-fragment. The tagged Ccd1 cDNA was then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. Different deletion mutants of Ccd1 were constructed using either PCR or convenient restriction enzyme sites. For Ccd1ΔN, the N terminus of wild-type Ccd1 was deleted at the EcoRV site and fused in-frame to the HA or Myc tag. Ccd1ΔDIX was constructed by PCR using primers 5′-catatgggagggacgcaagtcaaatgc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ttagtgagccaagaggacatctttg-3′ (reverse). To construct Ccd1ΔCC, the 5′-terminal fragment was obtained by BamHI digestion followed by blunt end reaction with Klenow; and the 3′-terminal fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5′-catatgcgccttcttcagcagcaccag-3′ and 5′-ttaattctctccatggtcttcttc-3′. Axin deletion mutant D1 was generated as described previously (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). D2 was created from a fragment by PCR using primers 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-gggctatgtgggatcttggatgaaaag-3′. D3 was constructed by replacing the SpeI/BamHI C-terminal portion of wild-type Axin with a PCR-generated fragment. The oligonucleotides for PCR were 5′-tattcaccgtctagaggctgtcc-3′ and 5′-actagttttaccaccaaaggg-3′.

MEKK4-specific siRNA expression plasmid pSUPER-MEKK4 was constructed following the instructions of the manufacturer. Transient Transfection, Coimmunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Transfection was performed in 60-mm dishes using Dosper Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted with the respective empty where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h post-transfection and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated 10 times for 1 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. HA- or Myc-tagged proteins or MEKK proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MEKK4 (Abgent) antibodies and protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels cells were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics), and immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (12Zhang Y.

Immunokinase Assays—FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma). JNK activity was determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (Stratagene) as substrate, followed by Western blotting using phospho-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling, Inc.) to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun as described previously (12Zhang Y.

RNA Interference—The human Ccd1-specific 19-mer nucleotide 5′-GGATGCCTTGCAGCAGAG-3′ was inserted into the pSUPER vector according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To test for the efficiency of pSUPER-Ccd1, cells were cotransfected with 1, 2, or 5 μg of pSUPER-Ccd1 and 0.5 μg of HA-Ccd1 plus pEGFP-C2 (0.3 μg) as a control for transfection efficiency. After 40 h of additional culture, cells were lysed, and the expression of Ccd1 was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA. The plasmid pSUPER-MEKK4 was described previously (17Luo W. Ng W.W.

AP1-Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293T cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of p36-AP1-Luc together with 2 μg of pSUPER vector or pSUPER-Ccd1 using DOSPER (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The p36-AP1-Luc reporter and luciferase activity assays were as previously described (23Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.-C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

Generation of Anti-Ccd1 and Anti-Axin Polyclonal Antibodies—Female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized separately with 1 mg of GST-fused Axin fragment (amino acids 348–500) and Ccd1 fragment (amino acids 22–152) in phosphate-buffered saline with complete Freund's adjuvant. Three weeks later, the rabbits were boosted with the same proteins with incomplete Freund's adjuvant every 2 weeks for a total of three times. The polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified and characterized as described previously (24Lin S.-C. Morrison-Bogorad M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23347-23353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ccd1 Inhibits JNK Activation by Axin and Dvl—We showed previously that DvlΔDEP inhibits JNK activation by Axin via dimerization through their DIX domains and that binding of glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinases causes conformational changes in Axin to disallow MEKK interaction (14Zhang Y. Qiu W.-J. Liu D.-X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The highly regulatory nature of Axin activation of JNK prompted us to test whether the newly identified DIX domain protein Ccd1 could also modulate the ability of Axin as well as Dvl to activate JNK. We first tested whether Ccd1 alone could activate JNK activity when expressed in HEK293T cells. Myc-tagged Ccd1 was cotransfected with FLAG-JNK1 into HEK293T cells, and immunokinase assays were carried out. Ccd1 alone had virtually no effect on JNK activity, whereas, as shown previously Axin and Dvl each robustly activated JNK (∼10-fold). When cotransfected, Ccd1 drastically inhibited JNK activation by Axin. Unexpectedly, Ccd1 also virtually abolished JNK activation by Dvl (Fig. 1A). We therefore asked whether knock-down of the endogenous Ccd1 protein could enhance JNK signaling. The siRNA expressed by pSUPER-Ccd1 could effectively reduce Ccd1 expression from the pCMV-Ccd1 plasmid (Fig. 1B, lower panels). When the pSUPER-Ccd1 was cotransfected with an AP1-luciferase reporter, the activity of the AP1-luciferase reporter was 2.2 times its basal level (Fig. 1B, graph). We then examined whether Ccd1-Axin complex formation could also disturb Axin homodimerization as does Dvl to inhibit Axin-mediated JNK activation. To address this, increasing amounts of Myc-Ccd1 were cotranfected with HA- and Myc-tagged Axin, and coimmunoprecipitation with anti-HA was performed. Results showed that increasing amounts of Ccd1 did not diminish the association of Myc-Axin in the HA-Axin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C), indicating that Ccd1 does not interfere with Axin homodimerization. Ccd1 Inhibits JNK Activation by Dvl through Interaction between DIX Domains—To examine the mechanism by which Ccd1 attenuated Dvl activation of JNK, we first determined the structural requirements in both Dvl and Ccd1 for Ccd1 to exert its inhibitory effect on Dvl. Cells were cotransfected with FLAG-JNK1 and HA-Dvl, HA-DvlΔDIX, or HA-DvlΔPDZ in the presence or absence of Myc-Ccd1. Although Ccd1 completely inhibited JNK activation by Dvl or DvlΔPDZ, it did not attenuate JNK activation by DvlΔDIX (Fig. 2A), indicating that complex formation between Ccd1 and Dvl is a prerequisite for Ccd1 inhibition. In parallel, we cotransfected different Ccd1 deletion mutants with HA-Dvl and FLAG-JNK1 and performed the immunokinase assay. Results showed that although deletion of the N-terminal region containing the leucine zipper region (Ccd1ΔN) did not affect Ccd1 inhibition of JNK activation by Dvl, Ccd1ΔCC, which removed the coiled-coil domain, and Ccd1ΔDIX lacking the DIX domain lost their abilities to inhibit JNK activation by Dvl (Fig. 2B). Because Dvl-mediated JNK activation requires Rac, we addressed the possibility that Ccd1 could prevent the complex formation between Dvl and Rac. However, we failed to see any change in the amount of Dvl coprecipitated with Rac by increasing levels of coexpressed Ccd1 (Fig. 2C). In addition, These results also showed that although Ccd1 could not interact directly with Rac, Ccd1, Dvl, and Rac could coexist in the same complex, indicating that Ccd1 inhibited Dvl-mediated JNK activation by forming a ternary complex of Ccd1·Dvl·Rac, in which Dvl·Rac is somehow blocked from further activating JNK. Ccd1 Utilizes Both Its DIX Domain and Coiled-coil Domain to Inhibit JNK Activation by Axin—Ccd1 is known to possess three very noticeable structural domains: a leucine zipper motif at the N terminus, a DIX domain at the C terminus which binds Dvl, and a coiled-coil domain in the middle. These three domains were deleted individually in mutants Ccd1ΔN, ΔDIX, and ΔCC. We first tested for any effect of these Ccd1 mutants on JNK activation by Axin in HEK293T cells. HA-Axin and FLAG-JNK1 were cotransfected with the Ccd1 deletion mutants, and an immunokinase assay was carried out. Results showed that Ccd1ΔN is as effective as the wild-type Ccd1 in JNK inhibition, indicating that the leucine zipper motif is not required for Ccd1 to inhibit JNK activation by Axin. In contrast, Ccd1ΔDIX and Ccd1ΔCC each only partially inhibited JNK activation by Axin (Fig. 3A). These observations indicate that both the DIX and coiled-coil domains are important and that they alone are insufficient for inhibiting JNK activation by Axin. Because Axin could activate JNK through either MEKK1 or MEKK4 in normal HEK293T cells, it is possible that the DIX or coiled-coil domain alone could only disrupt one of the two means by which Axin activates JNK. To clarify this, we carried out kinase assays using MEKK1–/– MEF cells and pSUPER-MEKK4-treated HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, Axin activated JNK well in MEKK1–/– MEF cells as we demonstrated previously (17Luo W. Ng W.W. Jin L.-H. Ye Z.Y. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and wild-type Ccd1 effectively attenuated JNK activation by Axin. However, the Ccd1ΔDIX mutant that partially inhibited Axin-induced JNK activity in HEK293T cells totally abolished JNK activation by Axin to an extent comparable with that by wild-type Ccd1. In MEKK1–/– cells, Ccd1ΔCC could not diminish JNK activation by Axin, which is solely dependent on MEKK4 (Fig. 3B). We then tested whether the same Ccd1 mutants would affect Axin-mediated JNK activation in HEK293T cells expressing MEKK4 siRNA. In these cells, Axin-mediated JNK activation was abolished by wild-type Ccd1 or Ccd1ΔCC but not ΔDIX (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the coiled-coil domain of Ccd1 is responsible for the inhibition of MEKK4-mediated JNK activation by Axin, whereas the Ccd1 DIX domain prevents JNK activation by Axin through MEKK1. A Distinct Domain but Not the DIX Domain of Axin Participates in Complex Formation with Ccd1—We showed previously that the DIX domain of Dvl could entirely abolish JNK activation by Axin. The observation that Ccd1 DIX domain could only partially inhibit JNK activation by Axin was somewhat peculiar but suggested that Ccd1 might not interact with the DIX domain of Axin. To test this, different deletion mutants of Ccd1 were cotransfected with Axin, and coimmunoprecipitation was carried out. Ccd1ΔN and Ccd1ΔCC, but not Ccd1ΔDIX, formed a complex with Axin (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, Axin mutant D-2 lacking its DIX domain still could readily coimmunoprecipitate with Ccd1; and mutant D-3, that lacked amino acids 600–700 but had an intact DIX domain, failed to bind Ccd1 (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the Ccd1 DIX domain interacts with a novel domain of Axin but not its DIX domain. Ccd1-Axin Complex Formation Competes against MEKK1 Binding to Axin—Axin must bind to one of the two mitogen-activated protein kinase 3, MEKK1, or MEKK4, to activate JNK. Furthermore, our above results showed that DIX domain and coiled-coil domain of Ccd1 each partially attenuate MEKK1- and MEKK4-mediated JNK activation by Axin. Together with our previous observations that MEKK1 binding to Axin has been shown to be highly regulated (14Zhang Y. Qiu W.-J. Liu D.-X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we tested whether coexpressed Ccd1 had any effect on Axin-MEKK1 complex formation in the cell. As shown in Fig. 5A, Ccd1 indeed competed against MEKK1 binding to Axin in a dose-dependent manner, although MEKK1 and Ccd1 bind to separate regions far apart in Axin. Similarly, in the presence of increasing amounts of Ccd1ΔCC, MEKK1 binding to Axin was gradually diminished (Fig. 5C). However, Ccd1ΔDIX that could not form a complex with Axin had no effect on MEKK1 binding to Axin (Fig. 5B), confirming that the Ccd1 DIX domain is required to abolish MEKK1-mediated JNK activation by Axin. Ccd1 Depletes MEKK4 from Axin by Physical Interaction with MEKK4—We then investigated how Ccd1 attenuates MEKK4 activation by Axin. We first wondered whether Ccd1 could also compete against MEKK4 binding to Axin. When Myc-Axin and HA-MEKK4C were cotransfected with increasing amounts of Myc-Ccd1, no decrease in Axin association with MEKK4 was observed. The first approximation was that Ccd1 did not disrupt the Axin-MEKK4 complex. However, we most unexpectedly found that Ccd1 itself formed strong complex with MEKK4 (Fig. 6A). To determine whether the complex formation of MEKK4, Ccd1, and Axin occurs in vivo at their physiologic levels, we carried out immunoprecipitation with untransfected HEK293T cells separately using anti-MEKK4, anti-Axin, anti-Ccd1, and rabbit control IgG, followed by immunoblotting to examine their copresence in the immunoprecipitates. The results showed that Axin, Ccd1, and MEKK4 were detected reciprocally in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6B, upper panels). In cells cotransfected with pSUPER-Ccd1 and MEKK4, MEKK4 coimmunoprecipitated by the Ccd1 antibody is drastically less than that from cells transfected with the empty pSUPER (Fig. 6B, second lane of the lower panels), indicating that the antibody raised against Ccd1 is specific. To test whether Ccd1 interaction with MEKK4 is direct, we transfected Ccd1ΔDIX defective in Axin binding into HEK293T cells and used anti-MEKK4 antibody to immunoprecipitate endogenous MEKK4; Ccd1ΔDIX was coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 6C). We then determined the Ccd1 amino acid sequence required for MEKK4 binding. Several deletion mutants of Ccd1 were cotransfected separately with HA-MEKK4C. Coimmunoprecipitation with anti-HA was performed, showing that removal of the coiled-coil domain rendered Ccd1 incapable of forming a complex with MEKK4 (Fig. 6D). These data indicate that Ccd1 uses its coiled-coil domain to interact with MEKK4 and the DIX domain to interact with Axin, forming a ternary complex. This explains why we did not see any apparent competition of wild-type Ccd1 against MEKK4 binding to Axin. To verify that further, we used Myc-Ccd1ΔDIX instead of wild-type Ccd1 to re-perform the competition assay. Indeed, Ccd1ΔDIX depleted Axin from MEKK4 immunoprecipitate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6E). The DIX domain is a signaling module that is conserved in Axin/conductin, Dvl, and Ccd1. In addition to its well documented function in mediating protein-protein interactions (25Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Hino S.-I. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4414-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the DIX domain has been shown to target Dvl to actin stress fibers and vesicular membranes (27Capelluto D.G.S. Kutateladze T.G. Habas R. Finklestein C.V. He X. Overduin M. Nature. 2002; 419: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and it is indispensable for JNK activation by Axin (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). By virtue of interaction via DIX domains, Dvl interferes with Axin-mediated JNK activation (14Zhang Y. Qiu W.-J. Liu D.-X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we tested whether Ccd1 could exert an effect on JNK activation by Axin and Dvl. We found that although Ccd1 itself could not activate JNK, it drastically inhibited JNK activation both by Axin and by Dvl. In addition, we found that although Ccd1 interacts with Dvl between their DIX domains, Axin utilizes a novel domain but not its DIX domain to interact with Ccd1. Although Ccd1 inhibits Dvl-mediated JNK activation by forming a ternary complex consisting of Ccd1 and Rac-bound Dvl, Ccd1 attenuates Axin-mediated JNK activation by adopting a dual mechanism to prevent MEKK1 binding and sequester MEKK4 through physical interaction (Fig. 7). Dvl proteins are key multimodular factors that read signals coming from the plasma membrane and route them into the correct intracellular pathways through interaction with diverse proteins using different domains (28Gao Z.H. Seeling J.M. Hill V. Yochum A. Virshup D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Wharton Jr., K.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 253: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 30Ciani L. Krylova O. Smalley M.J. Dale T.C. Salinas P.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As with Axin, Dvl robustly activates the JNK cascade when overexpressed, which depends on the DEP domain (13Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Genetic assays have shown that Dvl-mediated JNK cascades are critical for establishment of planar cell polarity in flies (13Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). A Dvl allele containing a single amino acid mutation in the DEP domain leads to defects in cell polarity, which can be rescued by the C-terminal DEP domain. In vertebrates, Dvl was shown recently to activate JNK by forming a complex with the small GTPase Rac in a Wnt-dependent manner (18Habas R. Dawid I.B. He X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Depletion or inhibition of Rac function perturbs convergent extension movement and gastrulation. Apart from a requirement for Rac, little is known about the regulation of Dvl activation of the JNK pathway. Our present study shows that Ccd1 forms a dimer with Dvl through its DIX domains and that Ccd1 must utilize its DIX domain to form a complex with Dvl to inhibit Dvl-mediated JNK activation. Because dimerization is not required for Dvl to activate JNK (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that Ccd1 abolishes Dvl activation of JNK by affecting its homodimer formation, but rather that Ccd1 utilizes its DIX domain for physical association and depends on another domain to exert its inhibitory effect. Supporting this notion is the finding that Ccd1 also requires its coiled-coil domain to inhibit JNK activation by Dvl. However, it remains unclear as to how the coiled-coil domain exerts its inhibitory effect. When we tried to see whether Ccd1 association with Dvl would affect Rac binding to Dvl, we instead observed a co-complex formation among Ccd1, Dvl, and Rac, although Ccd1 does not bind directly to Rac. This raises the possibility that Ccd1 binding prevents Rac from being activated or that Ccd1 offers a physical barrier to prevent Rac from interacting with normal substrates. The exact mechanism of how Ccd1 inhibits Dvl-mediated JNK activation needs to be investigated further. Meanwhile, given that Dvl also depends on Rac for JNK activation and that MEKK4 interacts with Rac, we tested whether MEKK4 acts downstream of Dvl. However, we did not observe any inhibitory effect by overexpressing kinase-dead MEKK4 (MEKK4-KM) on Dvl-activated JNK activity (data not shown). Interestingly, Ccd1 adopts a different approach to inhibit Axin-mediated JNK activation, in line with the different mechanisms in Axin activation of JNK. We have shown that Axin requires many elements/factors to activate JNK (12Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Rui H.L. Fan E. Zhou H.M. Xu Z. Zhang Y. Lin S.-C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37451-37458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Axin requires not only MEKK1 or MEKK4 binding to its distinct domains, it also requires homodimer/oligomer formation through the C-terminal dimerization domain, association with small ubiquitin-related modifier-E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT via the extreme C-terminal six amino acids, and a novel X domain inside the protein phosphatase 2A binding region. Moreover, the Axin-based complex engaged in JNK activation is highly modulated by conformational changes elicited by glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinase Iα/ϵ, which prevent MEKK1 and MEKK4 binding to Axin (14Zhang Y. Qiu W.-J. Liu D.-X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2Y. Deng, H. Zou, Z. Ye, and S.-C. Lin, unpublished data. In the present study, we found that like glycogen synthase kinase-3β and casein kinase Iα/ϵ, Ccd1 binding competes against MEKK1 binding to Axin. Unexpectedly, Ccd1 does not compete against MEKK4 binding to Axin, but rather interacts directly with MEKK4 to sequester it from association with Axin. When Ccd1ΔDIX, Axin, and MEKK4 are coexpressed, MEKK4 is found to be exclusively associated with Ccd1, indicating that Ccd1 can deplete MEKK4 and render it inaccessible to Axin. Thus, Ccd1 utilizes two strategies to abolish Axin activation of JNK, one to compete against MEKK1 binding, the other by physical interaction to block MEKK4 activation. It was demonstrated previously that a Ccd1 mutant designated as Ccd1ΔN lacking the N-terminal half containing the coiled-coil domain, functioned as a dominant-negative suppressor of Wnt signaling (5Shiomi K. Uchida H. Keino-masu K. Masu M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether this dominant-negative effect is a result of its failure to inhibit the JNK cascades mediated by the two Wnt regulators Axin and Dvl. In sum, our current study has revealed that the DIX domain protein Ccd1 inhibits JNK activation by the two critical Wnt regulators Axin and Dvl. Most remarkable is that Ccd1 adopts different means to inhibit the two JNK cascades activated by distinct mechanisms. Although the biological function of Ccd1-mediated inhibition of JNK cascades is not immediately clear, our data have revealed a perplexing regulatory network where Axin, Dvl, and Ccd1 all play a role in the JNK cascades.

Ca2+ controls a huge variety of biological processes, including the cell cycle, gene expression, and cell death (1Berridge M. Bootman M. Roderick L. Nat. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4186) Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, depolarization induces Ca2+ release and muscle contraction, in a process known as excitation-contraction coupling, which is mediated by dihydropyridine receptors in the T-tubule membrane and ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (2Melzer W. Hermann-Frank A. Lüttgau H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Depolarization of muscle cells in culture also results in a slow nuclear Ca2+ transient, unrelated to contraction (3Jaimovich E. Rojas E.

Slow Ca2+ transients in and around the nucleus have been proposed to link membrane depolarization to the regulation of gene transcription. On the one hand, myotube depolarization induces an increase in phosphorylation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), as well as mRNA levels of early genes like c-fos, c-jun, and egr-1. All of these responses are significantly blocked by reducing or eliminating the slow, IP3-mediated, Ca2+ transients (8Powell J. Carrasco M.A. Adams D. Drouet B. Ríos J. Müller M. Estrada M.

Consistent with this notion, a MAPK kinase inhibitor (UO126) blocked ERK activation and CREB phosphorylation in depolarized muscle cells far more efficiently than SB-203580, a specific inhibitor for the p38 MAPK (9Carrasco M.A. Riveros N. Ríos J. Müller M. Torres F. Pineda J. Lantadilla S. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1438-C1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERKs appear to be important constituents of at least one of the pathways involved in CREB phosphorylation induced by depolarization in skeletal muscle cells. In the present study, we have extended our analysis of upstream signaling pathways that lead to CREB phosphorylation, by focusing on protein kinase C (PKC). PKCs are a family of at least 11 serine/threonine kinases that are divided into three main subgroups based on their amino acid sequence and lipid-dependent activation requirements. Conventional (c) PKC isoforms (PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ) require Ca2+ and DAG for activation, the novel PKC isoforms (-δ, -ϵ, -η, and -θ) are Ca2+-independent but DAG-dependent, and atypical PKC isoforms (-ζ, -ι/λ, and -μ) are unresponsive to DAG and/or Ca2+ (15Quest A.F.G. Recent Res. Dev. Biochem. 2000; 2: 171-190Google Scholar). CREB is phosphorylated in vitro by kinases from this family (16Shaywitz A. Greenberg M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), but most of the results in the literature suggest that CREB phosphorylation downstream of PKCs is indirect and occurs through the activation of the ERK pathway (16Shaywitz A. Greenberg M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 17Roberson E. English J. Adams J. Selcher J. Kondratick C. Sweatt J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experimental model, depolarization induces a transient increase in IP3 mass with kinetics comparable with those of the slow Ca2+ transient (4Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278Crossref Google Scholar). PLC hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generates IP3 responsible for calcium release via IP3R and DAG. Together these two messenger molecules activate cPKC isoforms (15Quest A.F.G. Recent Res. Dev. Biochem. 2000; 2: 171-190Google Scholar). Hence, we were particularly interested in investigating the role of this group of PKCs in events leading to CREB phosphorylation/activation. Here we provide evidence showing that cPKCα activation and translocation to the nucleus is essential for depolarization-induced CREB phosphorylation, both in primary skeletal muscle cells and in the C2C12 muscle cell line. Depolarization-induced CREB phosphorylation was blocked by PKC inhibitors but not by others specific for CaMKs or PKA. Alternatively, conditions that lead to selective down-regulation with phorbol ester of most sensitive isoforms except PKCα did not affect CREB phosphorylation. Depolarization resulted in selective PKCα translocation to the nucleus in a PLC/IP3R-dependent manner that was required for CREB phosphorylation. Finally, cPKCα-dependent CREB phosphorylation did not appear to require an intermediate of the ERK pathway. Materials—Antibodies directed against PKCα, -βI, -ϵ, and -ζ and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against PKCβII, -δ, and -θ; total CREB; and total ERK2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against dually phosphorylated forms of ERK1 and ERK2 and phosphorylated CREB were from Cell Signaling Technology. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was from Pierce. ECL reagents were from Pierce or Amersham Biosciences. PKC inhibitor Gö6976 and PLC inhibitor U73122 were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories. Bisindoleylmaleimide I was from Calbiochem. All tissue culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Rat skeletal muscle cells in primary culture were prepared essentially as previously described (3Jaimovich E. Rojas E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, hindlimb muscle from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were mechanically dispersed and treated with 0.2% (w/v) collagenase. The suspension was filtered through lens tissue paper, spun down at low speed, and preplated to remove contaminating fibroblasts. The cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes or on coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes for immunostaining procedures. The plating medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and antimycotic. To eliminate remaining fibroblasts, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added at the beginning of myoblats alignment. To induce differentiation, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium. The experiments were performed in 6-7-day-old cultures. Myoblasts of the C2C12 cell line (ATCC) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with 10% bovine serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. For differentiation, the serum was replaced by 5% horse serum. The cells were studied 5-7 days after differentiation was initiated. Depolarization Experiments—The cells were incubated with Krebs-Ringer under resting conditions for 30 min. This medium contains 4.7 mm KCl. Depolarization was induced by changing to a medium containing 84 mm KCl, whereas the osmolarity was maintained by decreasing the NaCl concentration. The times of incubation with the inhibitors or other conditions are specified under “Results. ” The experiments were matched with vehicle-treated controls. Down-regulation Assays—The myotubes were treated with 100 nm 4-αTPA or 100 nm 4-βTPA for 24 h. Phorbol ester was removed, and the cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution for 1 h before depolarizing muscle cells as described above. Western Blot Analysis—Stimulated cells were lysed in 60 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The cell lysates were sonicated for 1 min, incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged to remove debris. Protein concentration of the supernatants was determined with bovine serum albumin as standard. The lysate proteins were suspended in Laemmli buffer, separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% fat-free milk, with or without 0.5% Tween 20, and then incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibody. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1.5 h. The immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The films were scanned, and the Scion Image program (National Institutes of Health) was employed for densitometric analysis of the bands. To correct for loading, the membranes were stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with the corresponding control antibodies. Immunostaining and Confocal Imaging—Myotubes grown on coverslips were processed essentially as previously reported (18Powell J. Petherbridge L. Flucher B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, the myotubes were fixed in ice-cold methanol, blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin and incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 90 min. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) to retard photobleaching. The samples were evaluated in a scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert 135 m-LSM Microsystem) and documented through computerized images. Immunoprecipitation—The myotubes were solubilized in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, EGTA, pH 7.8, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol, 140 mm NaCl, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). A 15,000 × g supernatant fraction was incubated with 10 μl of A/G-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology) for 30 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol). After the pre-cleaning procedure, the whole cell extract was incubated with 1 μl of anti-phosphorylated CREB for 1 h and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and blotted with the corresponding antibody. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—cDNA was amplified using c-fos primers, and the DNA concentration was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. PCR amplification was maintained in the exponential phase for each product. The c-fos primers used were 5′-AGGCCGACTCCTTCTCCAGCAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGATAGCTGCTCTACTTTGC-3′ (antisense), corresponding to bases 235-533 (9Carrasco M.A. Riveros N. Ríos J. Müller M. Torres F. Pineda J. Lantadilla S. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1438-C1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All of the experiments were performed a minimum of three times. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. The significance of differences among treatments was evaluated using t test for paired data or analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post-test for multiple comparisons. Depolarization-induced CREB Phosphorylation Required Calcium-dependent PKC Activity in Primary Skeletal Muscle Cells and in the Muscle Cell Line C2C12—Depolarization induces a transient increase in CREB phosphorylation in primary culture skeletal muscle cells (8Powell J. Carrasco M.A. Adams D. Drouet B. Ríos J. Müller M. Estrada M. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3673-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Carrasco M.A. Riveros N. Ríos J. Müller M. Torres F. Pineda J. Lantadilla S. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1438-C1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by an IP3-dependent slow Ca2+ transient. In skeletal muscle cells, IP3Rs are located to both the nuclei and the SR, and IP3 mass increases following depolarization (4Jaimovich E. Reyes R. Liberona J.L. Powell J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278Crossref Google Scholar, 8Powell J. Carrasco M.A. Adams D. Drouet B. Ríos J. Müller M. Estrada M. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3673-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKCs may be implicated as downstream effectors of these events required for CREB activation, pharmacological studies were performed. BIM I (2.5 μm), a specific but broad spectrum PKC inhibitor (19Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovssky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) essentially abolished CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The calcium dependence of CREB phosphorylation prompted us to investigate whether calcium-sensitive PKC isoforms were involved. To this end, myotubes were depolarized in the presence of Gö6976, a cPKC inhibitor (20Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M. Mischak H. Blubeerg P. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Scháchtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gö6976 (1 μm) essentially reduced P-CREB levels as efficiently as BIM I (Fig. 1B). Alternatively, rottlerin (10 μm), a novel PKC inhibitor (21Gschwendt M. Muller H. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), had no effect on CREB phosphorylation (data not shown; n = 3 experiments). To determine whether CaMK or PKA participate in depolarization-induced CREB phosphorylation in muscle cells, additional non-PKC inhibitors were employed. CREB phosphorylation was neither decreased by 10 μm KN-93 (Fig. 2A) or by 4 μm H-89 (Fig. 2B), inhibitors of CaMK and PKA, respectively. Taken together, the results obtained with inhibitors implicated cPKCs rather than CaMK or PKA in CREB phosphorylation and activation. To further investigate the role of PKCs, primary myotubes were exposed to the active (4β) and inactive (4α) forms of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Phorbol esters initially activate cPKCs and novel PKC but not the atypical PKCs isoforms (15Quest A.F.G. Recent Res. Dev. Biochem. 2000; 2: 171-190Google Scholar). Prolonged treatment, however, tends to trigger PKC down-regulation of responsive PKC isoforms by promoting proteolytic degradation. In myotubes incubated short term with the biologically active 4β-TPA (1 μm), CREB phosphorylation increased transiently 4-fold over basal levels, reaching a maximum between 10 and 15 min (Fig. 3). By contrast, the inactive 4α-TPA (1 μm) did not induce CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Moreover, the presence of BIM I (2.5 μm) abolished CREB phosphorylation induced by 4β-TPA (data not shown). Additional experiments were carried out using the mouse muscle C2C12 cell line. K+-induced depolarization triggers both fast and slow Ca2+ transients in this cell line, essentially by the same mechanisms as in primary myotubes (5Estrada M. Cárdenas J.C. Liberona J.L. Carrasco M.A. Mignery G. Allen P. Jaimovich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Depolarization of C2C12 cells also induced transient CREB phosphorylation similar to that observed for primary myotubes (Fig. 4A). P-CREB production in response to depolarization was completely suppressed in the presence of either BIM I (2.5 μm), or Gö6976 (1 μm) (Fig. 4B). Overall, these data implicated cPKCs in depolarization-induced CREB phosphorylation both in primary culture skeletal muscle and C2C12 cells. Characterization of PKC Isoforms in Skeletal Muscle Cells—The expression of different PKC isoforms was investigated by Western blotting using isoform-specific (α, βI, βII, ϵ, δ, θ, and ζ) anti-PKC antibodies in both primary culture skeletal muscle cells and in the C2C12 cells. All seven PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, ϵ, δ, θ, and ζ) were detected in primary cultures of rat skeletal muscle (Fig. 5, left column). In the C2C12 cell line, however, only three isoforms were detected, namely PKCα, -ϵ, and -ζ (Fig. 5, right column). Because CREB phosphorylation was suppressed in C2C12 cells by the PKC inhibitors BIM I and Gö6976, these observations suggest that PKCα was the cPKC isoform involved in CREB phosphorylation in this cell line. CREB Phosphorylation Following TPA-induced PKC Down-regulation—To identify in primary myotubes the specific isoform(s) that may be involved in depolarization-induced CREB phosphorylation, the effect of long term treatment with TPA was investigated. Myotubes were incubated with 100 nm TPA for 24 h, and down-regulation of the PKCs was assessed by Western blotting analysis. Under these conditions, the PKC isoforms βI, βII, δ, and θ were essentially eliminated. A small amount of PKCϵ was still apparent, whereas PKCζ remained unaffected. Unexpectedly, despite the complete loss of PKCβI and PKCβII protein, PKCα levels decreased only to 40% of controls. (Fig. 6A). Following chronic TPA (100 nm) treatment for 24 h, CREB phosphorylation in response to depolarization was assessed (Fig. 6B). Phosphorylation levels were similar to those attained in untreated cells. Myotubes treated in this way with either 4α- or 4β-TPA did not display significant differences in their ability to induce CREB phosphorylation in response to K+-dependent depolarization. These results corroborate findings from C2C12 cells suggesting that the calcium-dependent PKCβI and PKCβII isoforms were not involved in CREB phosphorylation. Instead, residual cPKCα appeared sufficient to stimulate the activation of this transcription factor in primary skeletal muscle cells. Depolarization-induced Nuclear Translocation of PKCα—Inactive forms of PKCs are often diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol or sometimes localized to specific regions or structures in the cell. A characteristic trait of PKCs is that activation often correlates with translocation between different intracellular compartments (22Quest A.F. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 231-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because CREB is a predominantly nuclear protein, we investigated by immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy whether the subcellular distribution of the cPKCs α, βI, and βII was altered and in particular whether translocation to the nucleus occurred upon depolarization. Interestingly, PKCα translocated from the cytosol to the nuclear region (Fig. 7A) with kinetics comparable with those observed for CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1). In the absence of stimulation PKCα was essentially absent from the nucleus. Following depolarization, PKCα was already detectable in the nucleus within 1 min (Fig. 7A, inset). PKCα levels increased until 5 min and were maintained until 15 min after stimulation. After 30 min the PKCα presence declined and then became undetectable at 60 min (Fig. 7A). PKCβI, in contrast, was only detected in the nucleus 60 min after stimulation (Fig. 7B), whereas PKCβII remained cytosolic at all times studied (Fig. 7C). In C2C12 cells PKCα translocation to the nuclear region was also observed during the first minute after depolarization but essentially disappeared by 60 min (Fig. 7D). CREB and PKCα Co-immunoprecipitation—Because the interaction between kinases and their substrates in situ often involves multiple interaction sites, we speculated that PKC may be present in a protein complex together with CREB after depolarization. To test this possibility, P-CREB was immunoprecipitated from cellular extracts of primary culture myotubes that had been previously depolarized in high potassium solution. As expected, P-CREB and PKCα co-immunoprecipitated in extracts obtained 5 min post-depolarization (Fig. 7E). Moreover, no co-immunoprecipitation of PKCβI or βII with P-CREB was detected under the same conditions. These results support the notion that CREB forms a complex with PKCα (but not other cPKCs) following depolarization. Calcium Dependence of PKCα Translocation—Because CREB activation is highly dependent on the slow calcium transient induced by depolarization, PKCα translocation was also assessed under conditions that abolish this calcium signal. In the presence of either 50 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (IP3 system inhibitor), 100 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (intracellular calcium chelator), or 10 μm U73122 (PLC inhibitor), treatments that block the slow calcium transient (5Estrada M. Cárdenas J.C. Liberona J.L. Carrasco M.A. Mignery G. Allen P. Jaimovich E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22868-22874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Powell J. Carrasco M.A. Adams D. Drouet B. Ríos J. Müller M. Estrada M. Jaimovich E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3673-3683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no PKCα translocation to the nucleus was observed in myotubes depolarized for 5 or 10 min (Fig. 8). Similar results were also obtained using C2C12 cells (data not shown). CREB Phosphorylation by PKC Did Not Involve ERK1/2 as Intermediates—Most published data suggest that PKC-dependent CREB phosphorylation is an ERK-mediated event, although ERK-independent mechanisms have also been reported (16Shaywitz A. Greenberg M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 17Roberson E. English J. Adams J. Selcher J. Kondratick C. Sweatt J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4337-4343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the ERK pathway plays a central role in CREB activation induced by depolarization in primary myotubes (9Carrasco M.A. Riveros N. Ríos J. Müller M. Torres F. Pineda J. Lantadilla S. Jaimovich E. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1438-C1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hence, we considered it important to determine whether PKC-dependent regulation of CREB phosphorylation actually involves an ERK intermediate. To this end, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assessed in primary myotubes depolarized both in the absence and presence of the PKC inhibitors bisindoleylmaleimide I (Fig. 9A) or Gö6976 (Fig. 9B). No effect of these inhibitors on ERK phosphorylation was detectable at concentrations that blocked CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Similar results were also obtained with C2C12 cells (Fig. 9C). These results and the observed co-"
https://openalex.org/W2092752023,"In salivary acinar cells, intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) signaling plays an important role in eliciting fluid secretion through the activation of Ca2+-activated ionic conductances. Ca2+ and cAMP have synergistic effects on fluid secretion such that peak secretion is elicited following activation of both parasympathetic and sympathetic pathways. We have recently demonstrated that cAMP exerts effects on Ca2+ release, through protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) in mouse parotid acinar cells. To extend these findings, in the present study cross-talk between Ca2+ signaling and cAMP pathways in human parotid acinar cells was investigated. In human parotid acinar cells, carbachol stimulation evoked increases in the [Ca2+]i and the initial peak amplitude was enhanced following PKA activation, consistent with reports from mouse parotid. Stimulation with ATP also evoked an increase in [Ca2+]i. The ATP-evoked Ca2+ elevation was largely dependent on extracellular Ca2+, suggesting the involvement of the P2X family of purinergic receptors. Pharmacological elevation of cAMP resulted in a ∼5-fold increase in the peak [Ca2+]i change evoked by ATP stimulation. This enhanced [Ca2+]i increase was not dependent on intracellular release from InsP3R or ryanodine receptors, suggesting a direct effect on P2XR. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of P2X4R and P2X7R mRNA and protein in human parotid acinar cells. ATP-activated cation currents were studied using whole cell patch clamp techniques in HEK-293 cells, a null background for P2XR. Raising cAMP resulted in a ∼4.5-fold enhancement of ATP-activated current in HEK-293 cells transfected with P2X4R DNA but had no effects on currents in cells expressing P2X7R. These data indicate that in human parotid acinar cells, in addition to modulation of Ca2+ release, Ca2+ influx through P2X4R may constitute a further locus for the synergistic effects of Ca2+ and PKA activation.

These processes are controlled in large part by the ACh-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i as a result of the Gαq-coupled, phospholipase C-catalyzed increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and subsequent Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (1Dobrosielski-Vergona K.

Initially, Ca2+-activated Cl– conductances present in the apical plasma membrane of the acinar cell are activated by the release of Ca2+. The result of net Cl– accumulation into the lumen leads to an electrical potential that allows Na+ movement via the paracellular pathway, and the subsequent osmotic movement of water creates an isotonic, NaCl-rich fluid, the primary saliva (10Baum B.J.

As a consequence of the Cl– flux through Ca2+-activated Cl– conductance, the membrane depolarizes and the driving force for secretion diminishes as the membrane potential (Vm) approaches the equilibrium potential for Cl– (ECl). To maintain the membrane potential and facilitate continued Cl– efflux, basolaterally located Ca2+-activated K+ channels open, allowing K+ efflux (7Petersen O.H. J.

Recently, cAMP has been shown to modulate the cellular Ca2+ release machinery. Specifically in mouse parotid acinar cells, stimulation with cAMP-raising agents and subsequent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) results in phosphorylation of type II InsP3 receptors (InsP3R), and increased sensitivity of the receptor to InsP3 (18Bruce J.I.

This enhanced Ca2+ release appears largely responsible for the potentiated CCh-evoked Ca2+ response that is observed following exposure to cAMP-raising agonists and is consistent with this event contributing to potentiated fluid secretion observed upon co-stimulation with cAMP and Ca2+ raising agonists. An initial goal of this study was to confirm that this mechanism is relevant in salivary gland tissue of human origin. Indeed, using two different cAMP-raising agents, the present study demonstrated that CCh-evoked Ca2+ signaling in human parotid acinar cells was potentiated with characteristics similar to that observed in mouse parotid acinar cells.In addition to ACh release following parasympathetic stimulation, extracellular ATP also functions as a regulator of salivary gland function. Indeed, various salivary gland acinar cells derived from an assortment of species express ATP-activated purinergic receptors (20Gallacher D.V.

Physiol. 1999; 277: C205-C215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purinergic receptor gene family consists of two distinct groups based on the signal transduction pathway activated by ATP binding. P2Y receptors (P2YR) act as traditional Gαq-coupled receptors, and thus activation results in an increase in [Ca2+]i (30Harden T.K. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 541-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P2X receptors (P2XR) conversely act as ligand-gated, cation-selective ion channels (31North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2438) Google Scholar). Activation of P2XR consequently results in the influx of positively charged ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ into the cell. Thus, P2XR represents an additional mechanism resulting in a increase in [Ca2+]i, which is independent of the InsP3R pathway. Salivary tissue has been reported to express P2X4 and P2X7 (P2Z) as well as P2Y1 and P2Y2 (P2U) receptors (22Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. J. Gen.

These receptors are thought to be activated by neuronally released ATP, co-packaged with various neurotransmitters. Additionally, it has been proposed that ATP released from neighboring acinar cells, possibly through exocytosis of zymogen granules or transit through gap-junction hemi-channels, acts in a paracrine manner (33Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Novak I. Nitschke R. Amstrup J. Cell Physiol.

A. 2002; 99: 9840-9845Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In terms of elevating [Ca2+]i, it has been suggested that activation of purinergic receptors by ATP is a more effective stimulus than activation of muscarinic receptors (21McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Lechleiter J.D. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this assertion ATP can effectively regulate secretory processes in salivary glands (21McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Lechleiter J.D. Cantley L.C. Talamo B.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the principal goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of ATP in human parotid acinar cells. Moreover, as synergism between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling is physiologically important in this tissue, the effects of raising cAMP on ATP-mediated Ca2+ signaling events were also evaluated. These latter experiments reveal a novel mechanism whereby raising cAMP can potentiate Ca2+-signaling events via an effect on P2X4R purinergic signaling in human parotid acinar cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Human Parotid Acinar Cells—Human parotid tissue was obtained from adult male and female subjects scheduled to have parotid surgery because their gland contained an adenoma or other type of tumor that required removal of all or a large portion of the gland. Not all of the normal tissue surrounding the tumor is typically used for diagnostic evaluation of the sample. This remaining tissue was collected immediately after surgical excision and transported in ice-cold physiological saline to the laboratory for acute functional assays, and cell preparations were begun within 1 h of surgical removal. Informed consent was obtained, and the use of human tissue was approved by the University of Rochester Institutional Review Board. Small groups of human parotid acinar cells were isolated by collagenase digestion of surgically resected human parotid glands using a protocol similar to that described previously for the isolation of rodent parotid acinar cells (36Nguyen H.V.

Briefly, parotid glands were dissected from connective tissue and minced in Earle's minimum essential medium (Biofluids, Rockville, MD) containing 2 mm glutamine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Type I-S trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Minced tissue was placed in Earle's minimum essential medium (Biofluids) containing 2 mm glutamine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Applied Science) and was dispersed by multiple triterations. Cells were resuspended in Basal Media Eagle (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 units-100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 until use.Digital Imaging of Intracellular Ca2+—Human parotid acinar cells were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2 AM (2 μm, TEFLABS, Austin, TX) by incubation for 30 min in a physiological saline solution at room temperature. Cells were removed from Fura-2-containing solution and resuspended in physiological saline solution used for imaging experiments that contained (mm): 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES, 5.5 glucose, 1.26 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Fura-2-loaded cells were allowed to adhere to a 25-mm glass coverslip for 1 min before cells were locally superfused at a rate of at least 1 ml/min using a 0.5-mm diameter fused silica tube placed within 100 μm of the cells to be recorded. Rapid solution changes were performed utilizing an electronic solenoid controlled perfusion system and gravity-fed reservoirs (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Imaging was performed using an inverted Nikon epifluorescence microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). Fura-2-loaded cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 nm using a monochromator-based illumination system, and the emission at 510 nm was captured using a high speed, digital charge-coupled device camera (TILL Photonics, Pleasanton, CA). The fluorescence ratio of 340 nm over 380 nm was calculated, and all data are presented as the change in ratio units. Images were acquired at a rate of 1 Hz with an exposure of 20 ms. All imaging experiments were performed at room temperature, essentially as previously described (8Giovannucci D.R. Bruce J.I. Straub S.V. Arreola J. Sneyd J. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J.

Traces are from a single cell, representative of multiple individual cells (>3 cells) from an imaged acinus in a particular experimental run, and n represents the number of experimental runs.PCR Analysis—Total RNA from three individual human parotid tissues was prepared using an RNeasy RNA kit (Qiagen). From these RNA preparations, cDNA preparations were made using an RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For positive controls total RNA from human brain, testis, and spleen were obtained from BD Biosciences. One-step RT-PCR was done for the positive controls using a commercially available kit (Invitrogen). Primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primers were diluted to a working solution concentration of 20 pm/μl. Each reaction contained (in μl): 2.5 10× PCR Buffer, 2.0 50 mm MgCl2, 1 4× dNTP (25 mm), 1 cDNA of interest, 0.5 forward primer, 0.5 reverse primer, and 0.1 Taq polymerase. All standard reagents were from Invitrogen. The total reaction volume was 25 μl. The PCR cycler protocol was 94 °C for 3 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, for 30 cycles, then 72 °C for 3 min, final hold 4 °C. Samples were separated on a 1–3% agarose (TAE buffered) gel for 1–2 h at 100 mV and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A 100-bp DNA ladder was used as a molecular size marker.

A. North (University of Manchester, UK) was transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided. Specifically, 5 × 104 cells were grown on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well culture plates and were co-transfected with 1 μg of the P2XR cDNA and 100 ng of pHcRed 1-N1 cDNA (red fluorescent protein for visualization of positively transfected cells) per well. Just prior to transfection cells were placed in 2 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium and incubated with the DNA mixture in 500 μl of Opti-MEM per well for 3–5hina5%CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 3–5 h the media was removed and the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then placed back into 2 ml of MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units-100 μg/ml) per well. Transfected cells were placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight, and experiments were performed the next day. All standard reagents not mentioned were from Invitrogen.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were prepared from isolated human parotid acinar cells. Briefly, cells were pelleted and resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer that contained (mm): 250 NaCl, 50 Tris, 5 EDTA, 50 NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4. Samples were sonicated and left on ice for 30 min to solubilize. Protein concentrations were measured using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Samples were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred at room temperature to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry transfer system for 1 h at 0.08 A (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal α-P2X4R and α-P2X7R primary antibodies were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and used at a 1:250 dilution. When indicated, the control antigen was preincubated in the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature prior to use (1 μg of antigen/1 μg of primary antibody). After 2 h of incubation in primary antibody at room temperature, the proteins were visualized using a 1:2000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce) exposed on XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recordings—ATP-activated cation currents were recorded at a sampling rate of 1 kHz using an Axopatch 200A patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), Axon digital interface, and pCLAMP version 9.0 software using the whole cell patch clamp technique. To measure ATP-activated currents in HEK-293 cells, cells were perfused with an extracellular solution containing (mm): 140 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES-CsOH, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.4. Internal patch solution contained (mm): 140 cesium acetate, 1.22 MgCl2, 10 HEPES-CsOH, 0.1 EGTA, 10 NaCl, 0.0365 CaCl2, pH 7.2. Intervals of 2–3 min were allowed between patch rupture and stimuli to allow for equilibration with the patch pipette solution. HEK-293 cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of –30 mV. Experiments were performed at room temperature. All currents were normalized to cell size.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using either a paired or unpaired t test. Data from several cells in a particular experimental run were averaged, and experiment averages were used to calculate the mean ± S.E. Two-tailed p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSEffects of cAMP on CCh-evoked Ca2+Signals in Human Parotid Acinar Cells—Experiments were first performed to characterize Ca2+ signaling events in human parotid acinar cells following muscarinic receptor stimulation. Low, physiologically relevant concentrations of CCh (100–300 nm) elicited oscillatory-type responses, typical of signals observed in mouse exocrine acinar cells at similar concentrations of muscarinic agonist. In contrast, higher concentrations of CCh (5 μm) resulted in a peak and plateau-type response, characteristic of maximal concentrations of agonists in a variety of exocrine cell types (Fig. 1A) (18Bruce J.I.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Recently, it has been reported that raising cAMP significantly potentiates CCh-induced Ca2+ release in mouse parotid acinar cells (18Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This effect was blocked by the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H89, and attributed to phosphoregulation of InsP3R (18Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Initially, experiments were performed to investigate if a similar phenomenon occurs in human parotid acinar cells. Prior incubation of human parotid acinar cells with forskolin (Fig. 1B) or the β-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline (Fig. 1C) to raise cAMP levels, significantly enhanced the peak amplitude of the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i signal by 146 ± 17% and 135 ± 13%, respectively, over the control response; p = 0.01. These data are consistent with studies in mouse parotid in which forskolin enhanced the CCh-evoked [Ca2+]i response by ∼150% (18Bruce J.I. Shuttleworth T.J. Giovannucci D.R. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cAMP-induced potentiation of CCh-stimulated Ca2+ signaling was blocked by prior incubation with H89 (second response reduced to 94 ± 3% of the first response) (Fig. 1D) suggesting that PKA activity was responsible for the effect. These data in human acinar cells are entirely consistent with studies from mouse and presumably reflect a similar mechanism; i.e. potentiation of Ca2+ release via phosphorylation of InsP3R.Extracellular ATP Stimulates an Increase in [Ca2+]i in Human Parotid Acinar Cells—Purinergic receptor stimulation has been reported to regulate secretory function in mouse and rat salivary glands by increasing [Ca2+]i. We therefore evaluated the effects of ATP in stimulating Ca2+-signaling events in human parotid acinar cells. A minority of cells responded following exposure to 1–50 μm ATP. 100 μm ATP however, consistently elicited an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A), although markedly smaller than Ca2+ elevations initiated by physiological muscarinic receptor stimulation. Significantly larger responses were not induced by higher concentrations of ATP (data not shown). Thus, although these observations suggest that human parotid acinar cells express at least one type of purinergic receptor, stimulation of these receptors results only in modest increases in [Ca2+]i in contrast to muscarinic stimulation.Fig. 2ATP stimulation results in an elevation of [Ca2+]i in human parotid acini.A, stimulation with 100 μm ATP results in a small reproducible Ca2+ transient. B, 100 μm UTP causes little, if any, Ca2+ response in human parotid acinar cells while stimulation with 100 μm ATP in the same cells generates a small Ca2+ transient. C, 100 μm ATP stimulation failed to increase [Ca2+]i in human parotid acinar cells in external Ca2+-free solution. However, addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium resulted in a significant increase in [Ca2+]i. This suggests that ATP is acting on P2XR. Each trace is representative of four or more experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Experiments were next performed to define the class of purinergic receptor responsible for the ATP-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i. Although ATP is an agonist at both P2YR and P2XR, UTP is considered to be a relatively selective activator of P2YR (24Turner J.T. Landon L.A. Gibbons S.J. Talamo B.R. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 210-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 41Muller C.E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 2353-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Stimulation with 100 μm-1 mm UTP did not cause a detectable [Ca2+]i response in the vast majority of human parotid acinar cells (Fig. 2B) (54 of 59 cells). In the four cells where an increase was detected, UTP stimulation resulted in a change of 0.018 ± 0.005 ratio units. In contrast, stimulation with 100 μm ATP in the same cells resulted in a significantly larger Ca2+ transient of 0.088 ± 0.021 units; p = 0.04 (Fig. 2B). These data provide an initial suggestion that P2XR are the predominant mediator of purinergic receptor Ca2+ signaling in human parotid acinar cells.Conceptually, a further paradigm to identify any contribution of P2YRs is to isolate Ca2+ release either by removing extracellular Ca2+ or alternatively by blocking Ca2+ influx through P2XR. In Ca2+-free external solution, 100 μm ATP failed to increase [Ca2+]i, indicating that Ca2+ release (presumably through P2YR) was not occurring to a signi"
https://openalex.org/W2089305895,"Ribonucleotide reductase is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides for use in DNA synthesis. Ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli consists of two subunits, R1 and R2. The R2 subunit contains an unusually stable radical at tyrosine 122 that participates in catalysis. Buried deep within a hydrophobic pocket, the radical is inaccessible to solvent although subject to inactivation by radical scavengers. One such scavenger, hydroxyurea, is a highly specific inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and therefore of DNA synthesis; thus it is an important anticancer and antiviral agent. The mechanism of radical access remains to be established; however, small molecules may be able to access Tyr-122 directly via channels from the surface of the protein. We used random oligonucleotide mutagenesis to create a library of 200,000 R2 mutants containing random substitutions at five contiguous residues (Ile-74, Ser-75, Asn-76, Leu-77, Lys-78) that partially comprise one side of a channel where Tyr-122 is visible from the protein surface. We subjected this library to increasing concentrations of hydroxyurea and identified mutants that enhance survival more than 1000-fold over wild-type R2 at high drug concentrations. Repetitive selections yielded S75T as the predominant R2 mutant in our library. Purified S75TR2 exhibits a radical half-life that is 50% greater than wild-type R2 in the presence of hydroxyurea. These data represent the first demonstration of R2 protein mutants in E. coli that are highly resistant to hydroxyurea; elucidation of their mechanism of resistance may provide valuable insight into the development of more effective inhibitors.

The large subunit (R1), encoded by nrdA, contains the substrate binding and catalytic site as well as the allosteric effector sites. The small subunit (R2), encoded by nrdB, contains a diiron site that is 5 Å distant from a stable tyrosyl radical that is essential for catalysis. Given that RNR mediates the balance of deoxynucleotide precursors for DNA synthesis, ribonucleotide reductase provides an attractive target for anticancer therapy (5Baker C.H. Banzon J. Bollinger J.M. Stubbe J. Samano V. Robins M.J. Lippert B. Jarvi E. Resvick R. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea (HU) is a highly specific inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase (6Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Utilized as an anticancer agent for decades, it has more recently been investigated for its ability to enhance anti-viral therapies (7Mayhew C.N. Phillips J.D. Greenberg R.N. Birch N.J. Elford H.L. Gallicchio V.S. Stem Cells. 1999; 17: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Lori F. Malykh A. Cara A. Sun D. Weinstein J.N. Lisziewicz J. Gallo R.C. Science. 1994; 266: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); presumably because its alteration of dNTP pools facilitates incorporation of chain terminating nucleoside analogs into DNA. In addition to its antiviral and anticancer properties, hydroxyurea alleviates crisis symptoms in sickle cell anemia patients through up-regulation of fetal hemoglobin (9Ho J.A. Pickens C.V.

Yang Y.-M. Am. J. Hematol. 2000; 65: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Hydroxyurea inhibits ribonucleotide reductase by scavenging the tyrosyl radical of the R2 subunit (11Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3485-3488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of E. coli R2 shows that the radical is buried deep within the hydrophobic core of R2 and is inaccessible to solvent (12Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how scavengers are able to access the radical. One hypothesis suggests that HU interacts with surface residues that conduct the radical to the surface of the protein through long range radical transfers. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Gerez and Fontecave (13Gerez C. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1991; 31: 780-786Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar) who demonstrate that hydroxylamine derivatives with large substituents are able to scavenge the tyrosine radical but would be unlikely to do so directly. Their results indicate that the charge of the scavenger is the most important property governing ribonucleotide reductase inhibition. The second hypothesis allows for scavengers, particularly small molecules like HU, to access the radical directly through small channels in the protein through which the Tyr-122 is visible in the crystal structure (14Larsen I.K. Sjöberg B.-M. Thelander L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Gerez C. Elleingand E. Kauppi B. Eklund H. Fontecave M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mutants with site-specific amino acid substitutions have been shown to reduce the half-life of the radical and increase the sensitivity of RNR to scavengers (15Gerez C. Elleingand E. Kauppi B. Eklund H. Fontecave M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, no mutants have been shown to enhance resistance and render the radical less accessible. Previous studies characterizing protein in cells resistant to hydroxyurea have all demonstrated that resistance was mediated by an increase in wild-type R2 protein levels (16Wright J.A. Alam T.G. McClarty G.A. Tagger A.Y. Thelander L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1987; 13: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Amara F.M. Hurta R.A. Huang A. Wright J.A.

Specific cancers and cancer cell lines have also been shown to exhibit decreased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (17Amara F.M. Hurta R.A. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4503-4506PubMed Google Scholar, 21Burton R.R. Kashour T. Wright J.A. Amara F.M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). In all cases, resistance was directly correlated with an increase in expression of the wild-type R2. In an attempt to better understand the mechanism by which hydroxyurea is able to inactivate R2, we have constructed a library of mutant R2 enzymes and selected for mutants resistant to hydroxyurea. The crystal structure shows a channel in which the phenyl ring of Tyr-122 is visible from the surface (12Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). This channel is partially lined by the contiguous amino acid residues 74–78 (Fig. 1). Previous studies have examined mutations at Ile-74 and Leu-77 with respect to radical content and stability (15Gerez C. Elleingand E. Kauppi B. Eklund H. Fontecave M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Single substitutions at these hydrophobic residues effectively both reduced the radical content and rendered the RNR more susceptible to radical scavengers. We hypothesized that amino acid substitutions at these positions might alter the channel and provide a more packed structure, blocking access of scavengers to the radical. Using the method of random mutagenesis, we have obtained mutants that enhance survival of E. coli more than 1000-fold HU over wild-type R2 and have carried out in vitro studies on the accessibility of the radical to hydroxyurea. Materials—Hydroxyurea, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, andthymidine were purchased from Sigma. E. coli thioredoxin reductase was the kind gift of H. Hernandez (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Antisera to R1 and R2 were the kind gift of C. Yee (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). R2 pET expression vector was the kind gift of B. A. Brown II (Wake Forest University). Randomized oligonucleotides were obtained from Midland. Plasmid pCDNA3 and oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Invitrogen, and the pET vector was from Novagen. E. coli thioredoxin was purchased from Promega. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Transformations—The R2 subunit of RNR is encoded by the nrdB gene. R2-deficient E. coli strain KK446 (F-, thr-1, leuB6, fhuA21, lacY1, glnV44(AS), lambda-, nrdB2(ts), thyA6, rpsL67(strR), thi-1, deoB37, deoC1) obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University) was used in all complementation experiments (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli XL-1 gold (Stratagene) was used for library construction cloning. Wild-type R2 was cloned using TOPO-cloning methods (Invitrogen) from KK446. R2 was expressed in a pBR322 vector under the lac promoter. Bacterial transformations were carried out by electroporation (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 16.54Google Scholar). All R2 constructs were sequenced in entirety after cloning procedures to ensure no mutations resulted from manipulation. Media—All cells were grown or plated in LB medium at 37 °C. KK446 is auxotrophic for thymidine; growth medium was supplemented with 20 μg/ml thymidine (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Library Construction and Cloning—A library of plasmids containing the R2 subunit with partially random nucleotides corresponding to amino acid positions 74–78 was assembled as described previously (23Sneeden J.L. Loeb L.A. Arnold F.H. Georgiou G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 231. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 65-73Google Scholar). An 86-mer oligonucleotide encompassing nucleotides 169–254 of the nrdB gene was synthesized (Midland): 5′-TCC CGG GAC CGT ATA GAT TAC CAG GCG CTG CCG GAG CAC GAA AAA CAC ATC TTT (ATC AGC AAC CTG AAA) TAT CAG ACG CTT CTA GA-3′. The nucleotides in parentheses were synthesized to contain 76% wild-type and 8% of each of the other three nucleotides at each position. This degree of randomness yields an average amino acid substitution of 2.38 per oligonucleotide (24Suzuki M. Christians F.C. Kim B. Skandalis A. Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Molecular Diversity. 1996; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The underlined nucleotides are complementary to primers for amplification; nucleotides in boldface encode SmaI and XbaI sites, respectively. The 86-mer oligo was PCR-amplified, and PCR products were digested overnight with SmaI and XbaI at 25 °C. Digests were verified by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and gel-purified using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Restriction sites were engineered into the plasmid-encoded R2 by PCR amplification with site-directed mutagenic primers, DpnI digestions, and transformation (Stratagene). To minimize wild-type contamination during the ligation processes, a stuffer vector of R2 was created by replacing the wild-type region (nucleotides 223–237) with a 1100-bp fragment of DNA from pCDNA3 plasmid DNA by digestion with SmaI and XbaI. The resulting R2 stuffer vector was then digested with SmaI and XbaI, gel-purified, and ligated overnight at 12 °C to the gel-purified oligonucleotide. The ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli. Complementation of E. coli KK446 and Selection of Active nrdB Mutants—Complementation was performed essentially as described previously (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydroxyurea hypersensitivity of strain KK446 has been mapped to the nrdB locus, which encodes the R2 protein (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type R2 on a medium-copy plasmid (pBR322) under the lac promoter was used as a positive control for complementation of KK446. Cells containing either stuffer, library, or wild-type plasmid-encoded R2 were diluted 1:100 from a fresh overnight culture, grown to 0.6 A600, and then plated onto LB agar containing 0, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mg/ml hydroxyurea and grown overnight at 37 °C. Sequence Analysis of nrdB Mutants—Plasmid from selected mutants were isolated, retransformed into fresh KK446 cells, and retested as described above to eliminate false positives. All mutants were sequenced on Applied Biosystems model 3700 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using big dye terminator chemistry. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared from E. coli after growth to mid-log phase, pelleted, and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 16.54Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with rabbit anti-R2 antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. R2 protein levels were measured by horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuant version 1.2 software (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Purification—R2 proteins were expressed under the lac promoter and purified in apo form in pET28a+ (Novagen) with an N-terminal His tag. BL21(DE3) cells containing plasmids were diluted 1:100 from fresh overnight culture into LB medium. At 0.6 A600 nm, 1,10-phenanthroline was added to the culture in a final concentration of 100 μm (25Parkin S.E. Chen S. Ley B.A. Mangravite L. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1124-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After a 15-min incubation, 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and incubation was continued for 16 h at 37 °C. The expressed His6-R2 fusion proteins were purified using a modified protocol from the supplier (Novagen). Pelleted cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 15 ml of 1× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) with protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and 50 μg/ml egg white lysozyme. Cells were lysed by freeze-thaw cycles, RNase A was added to 10 μg/ml, and the lysed cells were centrifuged twice at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was applied to 2 ml of charged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with slow turning. The resin was washed four times with 10 volumes of 1× binding buffer and batch-eluted with 10 ml of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole). Proteins were concentrated using a 10,000 Mr concentrator (Amicon), and washed three times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Purity was verified by electrophoresis through 12% SDS-PAGE. Concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (extinction coefficient = 130,050 m–1 cm–1) (26Salowe S.P. Stubbe J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 363-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of R2—Purified apoR2 was reconstituted by the addition of a 5-fold molar excess of deoxygenated Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2 to a deaerated protein solution that had previously been equilibrated with argon gas (27Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). After 15 min of incubation, R2 was exposed to air and desalted using an Amicon 10,000 Mr concentrator to remove unbound iron. Fe(II) was quantitated by the ferrozine assay (28Stookey L.L. Anal. Chem. 1970; 42: 779-780Crossref Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). Radical Half-life—Purified R2 was incubated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm HU, either in the presence or absence of 1.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CDP, and 9 μm R1 protein. The radical concentration was measured as corrected absorbance at 411 nm on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Absorbance values at 411 nm were applied to the following formula to obtain the radical concentration: A411 – [2(A406) + 3(A416)]/5 = corrected A411 (27Bollinger Jr., J.M. Edmondson D.E. Huynh B.H. Filley J. Norton J.R. Stubbe J. Science. 1991; 253: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficient of the Tyr radical is 1.784/mm × cm. Activity Assays—The activity of wild-type and mutant R2 protein was measured essentially as described previously (29Thelander L. Sjöberg B.R. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The consumption of NADPH in a thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase-coupled assay was measured by the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm at 37 °C. Reactions were typically carried out in 150-μl volumes containing 0.1 μm R2, 0.5 μm R1, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm CDP, 1.6 mm ATP, 0.5 μm thioredoxin reductase, and 20 μm thioredoxin in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and 15 mm MgSO4. One enzyme unit corresponds to the reduction of 1 nmol of CDP/min at 25 °C in excess of R1 protein. Each measurement represents the mean of six independent experiments. R2 Library Construction—To evaluate the importance of amino acid residues 74–78 of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R2) for activity and radical stability, random sequences were substituted at nucleotides encoding these residues, resulting in a library of mutants with an average of 2 amino acid substitutions per molecule (Fig. 1) (24Suzuki M. Christians F.C. Kim B. Skandalis A. Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Molecular Diversity. 1996; 2: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Library construction is described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, an 86-mer oligonucleotide library containing partially random sequences was synthesized; the 15 nucleotides encoding residues 74–78 were synthesized from a mixture that contained 8% of each of the three incorrect nucleotides and 76% of the wild-type nucleotide at each position. This insert library was substituted for the corresponding wild-type sequence of R2. The resulting plasmid-encoded R2 mutant library was transformed into E. coli KK446, a strain hypersensitive to HU (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at an efficiency of 1.67 × 105 colonies/μg DNA. Prior to selection, plasmid DNA was isolated from 66 clones and sequenced to determine library diversity. The number and type of substitutions are tabulated in Fig. 2A. The average number of amino acid substitutions per protein in the unselected library was 2.0, and the overall distribution was essentially random. Of 66 sequences, 11 contained a frameshift mutation within the randomized region and two encoded a stop codon; the library consisted of about 83% in-frame genes encoding the R2 subunit. All clones represented independent nucleotide substitutions, indicating robust library diversity (Fig 2A). Selection of Resistant R2 Mutants—To select for mutant R2 proteins resistant to HU, conditions were defined under which KK446 cells expressing inactive R2 plasmids do not survive. The E. coli strain KK446 was characterized by its hypersensitivity to hydroxyurea, a defect that has been mapped to the nrdB locus, which encodes the R2 subunit (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise mutation has not been characterized, KK446 encodes a wild-type R2 (data not shown). The phenotype can be rescued by addition of R2 in trans encoded on a medium-copy vector under the lac promoter. To select for active R2-expressing plasmids, cells containing either wild-type, random mutant library, or stuffer plasmids were plated at mid-log phase onto LB agar with concentrations of HU varying from 0 to 2.5 mg/ml. Survival was determined as the fraction of cells surviving relative to those plated without HU, as shown in Fig. 3. Complementation of the KK446 defect with plasmid-encoded wild-type R2 completely abolished HU hypersensitivity, similar to what has been described previously (3Fuchs J.A. Karlström H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas KK446 growth is completely abolished at 0.5 mg/ml HU, cells with plasmid-encoded R2 survive at ∼30% relative to cells grown in the absence of drug. Expression of plasmid-encoded stuffer vector (or pBR322 vector only, data not shown) allows minimal survival at up to 1.0 mg/ml HU. The reason for this modest survival increase relative to KK446 alone is unknown but may relate to the up-regulation of replication machinery in cells containing plasmids. The survival of cells expressing the R2 library exhibited robust complementation relative to wild-type, indicating a high proportion of active, resistant clones in the R2 library. Plasmids from the library were isolated from individual colonies grown on 0.5 mg/ml HU and sequenced (Fig 2B). Of 68 sequences obtained, none contained either stop codons or frameshift mutations, indicating that at 0.5 mg/ml, all surviving colonies expressed active R2. A number of different substitutions were tolerated at residues 74, 75, and 78, but no mutations were observed at Asn-76; all substitutions at this position were silent. Leu-77 is conserved from bacterial to mammalian proteins and, as expected, tolerates only conservative substitutions, and then only at low HU concentrations (Fig 2, B and C). S75TR2 Is Highly Resistant to HU—For identification of mutant R2 proteins highly resistant to HU, the library was selected against HU concentrations up to 2.5 mg/ml, at which concentration the wild-type plasmid-encoded R2 survives at 5.7 × 10–5 relative to that in the absence of HU (Fig. 3). Cells carrying the stuffer vector were unable to form colonies at this concentration. Plasmid DNA from the library was isolated from individual colonies and sequenced (Fig 2C). The sequence data reveal a striking enrichment of plasmids that contain substitutions at Ser-75. Of 78 sequences, 67 contained substitutions at this residue; 57 of these were single amino acid substitutions, 9 were double, and 1 contained a triple substitution. Of these single mutations, 41 encoded S75T substitutions. The overrepresentation of single S75T mutations was not due to a jackpot event, as all four threonine codons were observed among the 17 independent clones containing various silent mutations (data not shown). Multiple selections of the library in sequential selection at increasing concentrations of HU also yielded S75T as the predominant observed mutation. To eliminate false positives, plasmids were isolated from individual clones that grew in 2.5 mg/ml HU, and the plasmid DNA was retransformed into fresh cells and retested for resistance; all mutants exhibited no differences in survival rates (data not shown). When compared directly with the wild-type R2 plasmid in KK446, transfection with S75TR2 resulted in more than a 1000-fold increase in survival at 1.5 mg/ml HU (Fig. 3). At this concentration, less than 0.1% of cells expressing wild-type R2 survive, in contrast to cells expressing S75TR2, where 50% of cells form colonies. Concentrations higher than 2.5 mg/ml HU are required to abolish 99.9% of cells containing this mutant, which can form colonies at up to 5.0 mg/ml HU (data not shown). Among the mutants obtained by selection at 2.5 mg/ml HU, S75TR2 was the most resistant (data not shown). To ensure that resistance was not a function of protein overexpression, R2 levels in lysates obtained from cells grown to mid-log phase were quantified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Extracts from E. coli KK446 with plasmid only (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2) or plasmids containing wild-type R2 (lanes 3 and 4), stuffer vector (lanes 5 and 6), and S75TR2 (lanes 7 and 8) were examined. Densitometric analysis showed that expression levels between extracts of plasmid-encoded wild-type R2 or S75TR2 are indistinguishable; therefore resistance of S75TR2 to HU is not mediated by increased R2 expression. Radical Content and Activity of Purified R2 Proteins—Western analysis revealed that the survival increase of S75TR2 was not mediated by overexpression of the mutant protein. To analyze the relative radical content and activity of S75TR2, His-tagged wild-type and mutant R2 apoproteins were purified to homogeneity on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and reconstituted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To assess the effect of the mutation on radical and iron content, we measured the absorbance of each between 420 and 260 nm. The tyrosyl radical of R2 has an absorbance maximum at 411 nm. Reconstituted wild-type and S75T R2 exhibited no differences in radical content, with radical/dimer ratios averaging 1.2 (Table I). The absorbances at 325 and 370 nm of wild-type and mutant protein were indistinguishable, indicating a lack of change in iron center structure and content.Table IR2Radical contentActivitymol/mol R2Unit/mg R2Wild type1.24380 ± 628S75T1.21663 ± 351 Open table in a new tab Ribonucleotide reductase activity was measured according to Thelander et al.

The specific activity of the wild-type reconstituted RNR correlates with previous observations (29Thelander L. Sjöberg B.R. Eriksson S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6355-6361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of S75TR2 is 2.6-fold less than that of the wild type (Table I). Purified S75T R2 Demonstrates Increased HU Resistance—To assess the stability of the tyrosyl radical in vitro, purified R2 proteins were incubated with 2 mm HU in both the presence and absence of cofactors R1, CDP, and ATP. In the absence of HU or other scavengers, the R2 radical has an extremely long half-life, surviving for days at room temperature or for months stored at –80 °C. Scavengers like HU can efficiently abstract the radical, however, in a manner dependent on the regulatory state of the enzyme (31Karlsson M. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12622-12626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, wild-type R2 alone had a half-life of 12.1 min at 25 °C in the presence of 2 mm HU (Fig. 5). The radical half-life of S75T R2 (12.6 min) alone was indistinguishable from that of wild-type R2. The addition of stoichiometric amounts of R1 protein to wild-type R2 did not alter the radical half-life. In contrast, the addition of R1 to the S75T mutant protein increased the r"
https://openalex.org/W1986525711,"Aminopeptidase A (APA, EC 3.4.11.7) is a type II integral membrane glycoprotein responsible for the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin III in the brain. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies and the recent molecular modeling of the APA zinc metallopeptidase domain have shown that all the amino acids involved in catalysis are located between residues 200 and 500. The APA ectodomain is cleaved in the kidney into an N-terminal fragment corresponding to the zinc metallopeptidase domain, and a C-terminal fragment of unknown function. We investigated the function of this C-terminal domain, by expressing truncated APAs in Chinese hamster ovary and AtT-20 cells. Deletion of the C-terminal domain abolished the maturation and enzymatic activity of the N-terminal domain, which was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum as an unfolded protein bound to calnexin. Expression in trans of the C-terminal domain resulted in association of the N- and C-terminal domains soon after biosynthesis, allowing folding rescue, maturation, cell surface expression, and activity of the N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain. We also show that the C-terminal domain is not required for the catalytic activity of APA but is essential for its activation. Moreover, we show that the C-terminal domain of aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2, APN) also promotes maturation and cell surface expression of the N-terminal domain of APN, suggesting a common role of the C-terminal domain in the monozinc aminopeptidase family. Our data provide the first demonstration that the C-terminal domain of an eukaryotic exopeptidase acts as an intramolecular chaperone.

Expression in trans of the C-terminal domain resulted in association of the N- and C-terminal domains soon after biosynthesis, allowing folding rescue, maturation, cell surface expression, and activity of the N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain. We also show that the C-terminal domain is not required for the catalytic activity of APA but is essential for its activation. Moreover, we show that the C-terminal domain of aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2, APN) also promotes maturation and cell surface expression of the N-terminal domain of APN, suggesting a common role of the C-terminal domain in the monozinc aminopeptidase family. Our data provide the first demonstration that the C-terminal domain of an eukaryotic exopeptidase acts as an intramolecular chaperone. Aminopeptidase A (APA, 1The abbreviations used are: APA, aminopeptidase A; Ang II, angiotensin II; Ang III, angiotensin III; GluNA, α-l-glutamyl-β-naphthylamide; HA, hemagglutinin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase. EC 3.4.11.7) is a homodimeric membrane-bound zinc metallopeptidase that is activated by calcium and specifically cleaves the N-terminal glutamyl or aspartyl residue from peptide substrates such as angiotensin II (Ang II) and cholecystokinin-8 (1Nagatsu I.

Neuroimmunol. 1993; 3: 195-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in vitro. APA is present in many tissues, particularly in the renal and intestinal brush border epithelial cells and in the vascular endothelium (3Lodja Z. Gossrau R. Histochemistry. 1980; 67: 267-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). APA has been identified in several brain nuclei involved in the control of body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions, together with other components of the brain renin-angiotensin system (4Zini S. Masdehors P. Lenkei Z. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Studies using specific and selective APA inhibitors (5Chauvel E.N. Llorens-Cortès C. Coric P. Wilk S. Roques B. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that, in vivo, APA is responsible for the conversion of brain Ang II to angiotensin III (Ang III) (6Zini S. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortès C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the inhibition of central but not peripheral APA with specific and selective inhibitors leads to a large decrease in arterial blood pressure (7Reaux A. de Mota N. Zini S. Cadel S. Fournie-Zaluski M. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 69: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that central APA might be an interesting candidate target for the treatment of hypertension (8Reaux A.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies, based on alignment of the APA sequence with the sequences of other monozinc aminopeptidases, were initially used to probe the organization of the APA active site (14Wang J.Y.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14440-14448Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We used the functional data collected in these studies and the recently resolved x-ray crystal structure of leukotriene A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase (EC 3.3.2.6) (20Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme, to construct a three-dimensional model of the mouse APA extracellular domain from residues 79 to 559, corresponding to the zinc metallopeptidase domain (21Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29242-29252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). According to this model, the zinc metallopeptidase domain is folded into a flat triangle composed of an N-terminal subdomain consisting mostly of β-sheets, a globular catalytic subdomain, and a C-terminal helical subdomain. The active site is located at the interface of the N- and C-terminal subdomains and contains all the residues involved in zinc binding, substrate binding, and catalysis previously characterized by site-directed mutagenesis. It has been suggested that APA has two distinct extracellular domains in vivo. First, proteolytic fragmentation studies of purified pig APA (22Hesp J.R. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3000-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that this protein exists in vivo as two polypeptides of 107 and 45 kDa (22Hesp J.R. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3000-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing showed that the 107-kDa fragment was the N-terminal extracellular domain of APA from residues 43 to 602, corresponding to the active site-containing zinc metallopeptidase domain we have modeled, whereas the 45-kDa fragment corresponded to the C-terminal domain of APA, from residues 603 to 942. Second, structural studies based on electron microscopy of purified pig intestinal APN incorporated into lipid membranes also suggested the existence of a C-terminal globular domain different from the zinc metallopeptidase domain (23Hussain M.M. Tranum-Jensen J. Noren O. Sjöström H. Christianson K. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Finally, in the rat hippocampus, a short variant of APA produced by alternative splicing and lacking the C-terminal domain has been cloned. This protein displayed no APA activity when produced in COS-1 cells (24Lee H.J. Tomioka M. Takaki Y. Masumoto H. Saido T.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the absence of the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain of mouse APA, when produced alone in COS-1 cells, was an inactive enzyme, which remained blocked in the endoplasmic reticulum (25Ofner L.D. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggests that the C-terminal domain of APA may be involved in the correct folding of APA. We tested this hypothesis by constructing two truncated forms of recombinant mouse APA, one corresponding to the zinc metallopeptidase domain, from the first residue of APA to residue 598, tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG epitope (FLAG-N-APA), and the other corresponding to the C-terminal domain, from residues 595 to 945, tagged at its N terminus with the HA epitope (HA-C-APA). These proteins were expressed in CHO and AtT-20 cells, either separately or in trans, for studies of the influence of the C-terminal domain of APA on the maturation, subcellular localization, folding, and activity of the N-terminal metallopeptidase domain. To determine if there is a common role for the C-terminal domain of monozinc aminopeptidases, we have investigated the role of the C-terminal domain of APN. For this purpose, we produced the FLAG-tagged N-terminal domain of APN from residues 1 to 606 (FLAG-N-APN) and the HA-tagged C-terminal domain of APN from residues 607 to 966 (HA-C-APN) and studied if the role of the C-terminal domain of APN was similar to that of the C-terminal domain of APA.

Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and tagged at its N terminus with a polyhistidine tail (His6-WT-APA) has been described elsewhere (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). FLAG-WT-APA and FLAG-N-APA were constructed in pcDNA3 by PCR, using the mouse APA sequence as a template. A forward primer encoding the FLAG epitope and the seven first residues of APA and introducing an upstream HindIII restriction site was used for both constructs (primer A: T CAT CAA GCTT ATG AAG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GCC ATG AAC TTT GCA GAG GAA GAG). A reverse primer encoding the last six residues of APA and introducing a downstream EcoRI restriction site was used for FLAG-WT-APA (primer B: ATC TGC AGA ATT CTA CGG CAG GCT AGC GAA CCA). A reverse primer encoding residues 592-598 of APA, replacing residue 599 by a stop codon and introducing a downstream EcoRI restriction site was used for FLAG-N-APA (primer C: ATC TGC AGA ATT CTA ATT CAG AGT GAT TCC TCC TTT GTC). HA-C-APA was constructed in pSec-tag2 by PCR, using FLAG-WT-APA as a template. A forward primer encoding the HA epitope and residues 596-602 of APA and introducing an upstream HindIII restriction site was used (primer D: CGT ACG TAC GAA GCT TCA TAC CCT TAC GAC GTT CCT GAT TAC GCT ATC ACT CTG AAT GCT AAT CTT). The reverse primer used for this construct was primer B. N-APN was cloned from the mouse brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) using a forward primer encoding residues 1-7 of APN (primer E: ATG GCC AAG GGG TTC TAC ATT) and a reverse primer encoding residues 601-606 of APN, replacing residue 607 by a stop codon, and introducing a downstream EcoRI restriction site (primer F: ATC TGC AGA ATT CTA GTT TTT CTC GAC ATC CAG CCA). The resulting PCR product was used as a template to construct FLAG-N-APN in pcDNA 3 by PCR. A forward primer encoding the FLAG epitope, the first seven residues of APN and introducing an upstream HindIII restriction site was used (primer G: TC ATC AAG CTT ATG AAG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GCC ATG GCC AAG GGG TTC TAC ATT). The reverse primer was primer F. C-APN was cloned from the mouse brain Marathon-Ready™ cDNA library using a forward primer encoding the residues 607-614 of APN (primer H: CAG AGT GCA AAG TTC CAG ACA), and a reverse primer encoding the residues 961-966 of APN and introducing a downstream EcoRI restriction site (primer I: ATC TGC AGA ATT CTA ACT GCT GTT CTC TGT GAA). The resulting PCR product was used as a template to construct HA-C-APN in pSec Tag-2 by PCR. A forward primer encoding the HA epitope, residues 607-614 of APN and introducing an upstream SfiI restriction site was used (primer J: GCG GCC CAG CCG GCC TCA TAC CCT TAC GAC GTT CCT GAT TAC GCT CAG AGT GCA AAG TTC CAG ACA). The reverse primer was primer I. The absence of nonspecific mutations was confirmed by automated sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 377 DNA Sequencer with dye deoxy-terminator chemistry. Cell Culture, Transfection of CHO-K1 and AtT-20 Cells, and Purification of Recombinant His6-WT-APA and His6-N-APA—CHO-K1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Roche Applied Science). AtT-20 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% NuSerum IV (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). CHO and AtT-20 cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). For stable expression of FLAG-WT-APA, FLAG-N-APA, and FLAG-N-APA+HA-C-APA, transfected CHO cells were selected for resistance to Zeocin (10 days, 200 μg/ml) or zeocin plus hygromycin (10 days, 200 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Clones were screened by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis, to select cells with homogeneous expression. For transient expression, CHO and AtT-20 cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes and treated for biochemical or immunofluorescence studies 24-36 h later. His6-WT-APA and His6-N-APA were purified from membrane preparations by metal affinity chromatography, with a metal chelate resin column (Talon Co2+), as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of the final preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, as described by Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—300,000 stably transfected CHO cells (for FLAG-WT-APA, FLAG-N-APA, and FLAG-N-APA+HA-C-APA) or transiently transfected CHO cells (for HA-C-APA, FLAG-N-APN, HA-C-APN, and FLAGN-APN+HA-C-APN) were seeded in 6-well plates. The cells were grown for 36 h and then incubated for 30 min in methionine-, cysteine-, and serum-free medium (Ham's F-12) supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (pulse). The cells were then incubated for various periods of time in Opti-MEM medium (chase). The medium was discarded, the cells were harvested, and proteins were solubilized by incubation at 4 °C with 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (lysis buffer). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material. The supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG mAb or 1 μg of anti-HA mAb, and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (10% v/v) for 2 h at 4 °C for immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with solubilization buffer and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8. Proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and resolved by 5%, 7.5%, or 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and placed next to a K-screen (Kodak) for FX Molecular Imaging and QuantityOne software analyses (Bio-Rad). Peptide N-Glycosidase F and Endoglycosidase H Treatment—A population of 300,000 stably transfected CHO cells producing FLAG-W-TAPA and FLAG-N-APA, either alone or with HA-C-APA, or of transiently transfected CHO cells producing HA-C-APA, was subjected to 5 h of [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling. Cell extracts were produced, and FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated. The samples were washed and centrifuged as described above. The immune complexes were then eluted by boiling for 15 min in 25 μl of denaturing buffer (0.25% SDS). The samples were diluted 1:4 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, and 1 μl of Triton X-100 was added to prevent the denaturation of glycosidases by SDS. The samples were then incubated with or without peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Roche Applied Science) (5 milliunits at 37 °C for 18 h), or endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Roche Applied Science) (1 unit at 37 °C for 18 h). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 5%, 7.5%, or 10% acrylamide gels, which were then dried and analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Trypsin Treatment—The immunoprecipitates from 300,000 stably transfected [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled CHO cells were treated with 25 μg of trypsin for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 57 mm PMSF. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transiently transfected CHO or AtT-20 cells (300,000 cells) were harvested and lysed by incubation for 1 h in lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-HA Ab or anti-calnexin Ab, and 10% v/v protein A-Sepharose for 2-3 h. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, then three times with PBS and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-FLAG mAb. Immunodepletion of HA-C-APA—300,000 CHO cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-N-APA and HA-C-APA. The cells were grown for 36 h and then extracted by incubation in lysis buffer overnight. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with 1 μg of anti-HA mAb, and 10% v/v protein A-Sepharose for 4 h. Supernatants were separated from the bead complex and subjected to two more rounds of immunoprecipitation. Clearing of the samples from HA-C-APA was monitored by immunoblotting, with an anti-HA mAb, the beads and the supernatants at each round of immunoprecipitation. The FLAG-N-APA levels in each sample were compared by anti-FLAG mAb (1:1000) immunoblotting of the samples, for equivalent amounts of protein. Immunoreactive material was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-mouse antibody, using ATTOPHOS as the chemifluorescent substrate. Chemifluorescence was measured using a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad), allowing direct quantification of the bands. Immunofluorescence—Transiently or stably transfected CHO cells and AtT-20 cells were seeded (25,000 cells) on 14-mm diameter coverslips. The cells were cultured for 48 h, then fixed and permeabilized by incubation for 5 min in 100% ice-cold methanol. The cells were rinsed three times in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), then saturated by incubation with 5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. They were then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-(rat APA) serum (28Song L. Ye M. Troyanovskaya M. Wilk E. Wilk S. Healy D.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F546-F557PubMed Google Scholar), or of anti-FLAG mAb, and/or of anti-HA Ab, and/or 1:500 dilution of anti-PDI mAb in PBS, 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with cold PBS and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of cyanin 3-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody and/or of Alexa 488-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse antibody, and/or cyanin 5-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, in PBS, 2% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed four times with PBS and mounted in Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich) for confocal microscopy analysis. Cells were examined with a Leica TCS SP II (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with an argon/krypton laser and configured with a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope. All the double-labeling experiments were analyzed in sequential scanning mode. Images (1024 × 1024 pixels) were obtained with a 63× magnification oil-immersion objective. Each image corresponds to a cross-section of the cell. Enzyme Assay of Solubilized Cells—CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-WT-APA and FLAG-N-APA were solubilized in lysis buffer. The levels of each protein were compared by anti-FLAG (1:1000) immunoblotting of the samples, as described above. The APA activity of the various samples was determined by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate, GluNA, as previously described (5Chauvel E.N. Llorens-Cortès C. Coric P. Wilk S. Roques B. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2950-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of recombinant FLAG-N-APA were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5 × 10-4m GluNA, 4 mm CaCl2 in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Bestatin, a nonspecific aminopeptidase inhibitor, was used at a concentration of 1 μm, which did not inhibit APA but prevented degradation of the substrate by aminopeptidases such as B, N, and W, and cytosolic aminopeptidases (29Schalk C. d'Orchymont H. Jauch M.F. Tarnus C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Tieku S. Hooper N.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1725-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were performed in the presence or absence of the APA inhibitor glutamate phosphonate (GluPO3H2, 1 μm). Enzyme Assay of Purified APA—The enzymatic activities of His6-WT-APA and His6-N-APA were determined in a microtiter plate, by monitoring the rate of hydrolysis of GluNA, as previously described (18Iturrioz X. Vazeux G. Celerier J. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3061-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots, with a final concentration of GluNA of 0.025-2 mm. All enzymatic assays were performed under initial velocity conditions. Spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the absorbance of blank incubations without enzyme. The sensitivity of His6-WT-APA and His6-N-APA to inhibition by glutamate phosphonic acid (l-GluPO3H2 (31Lejczak B. Choszczak M.P.D. Kafarski P. J. Enzyme Inhibition. 1993; 7: 97-103Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) was determined by establishing dose-dependent inhibition curves for a final GluNA concentration of 0.5 mm and calculating Ki values with GraphPad Prism 2 software. The sensitivity of His6-WT-APA and His6-N-APA to calcium was determined by establishing dose-dependent activation curves and calculating ED50 values of CaCl2 with GraphPad Prism 2 software. Statistical comparisons were performed with Student's unpaired t test. Differences were considered significant if p was <0.05. APA is composed of a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain divided into two parts: an N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain up to residue 598, including the active site of the enzyme, and a C-terminal domain corresponding to the last 347 amino acid residues of the extracellular domain of APA. We investigated the impact of the C-terminal domain of APA on the generation of a correctly membrane-bound active APA enzyme. To this end, we generated several cDNA constructs (Fig. 1) encoding either the entire mouse APA or one of the individual domains, which we then expressed in CHO cells. We assessed the folding, trafficking, subcellular localization, and enzymatic activity of each of the corresponding recombinant proteins. One construct corresponded to the entire sequence of the mouse wild-type APA (WT-APA), tagged at its N terminus either with the FLAG epitope (FLAG-WT-APA), or with a polyhistidine (His6) tail (His6-WT-APA) to allow purification of the enzyme. A second construct (N-APA) included the mouse APA sequence from residues 1 to 598 (which corresponds to Asn-602 of pig APA) containing the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain functioning as a signal peptide, the N-terminal zinc metallopeptidase domain, tagged at its N terminus either with the FLAG epitope (FLAG-N-APA), or with the polyhistidine tail (His6-N-APA). A third construct was also generated, corresponding to the C-terminal domain of APA from residues 596 to 945 (C-APA). Because the C-terminal domain does not possess a signal sequence for translocation into the ER, the cleavable signal sequence of mouse Igκ (32Coloma M.J. Hastings A. Wims L.A. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 152: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was fused to the mouse APA C-terminal domain sequence allowing ER translocation and secretion of the fusion protein. This third construct was tagged at its N terminus with the HA epitope (HA-C-APA). The cDNA constructs encoding FLAG-WT-APA, FLAG-N-APA, and HA-C-APA were used to transfect CHO cells, and the expression of the corresponding recombinant proteins was studied. Comparison of the Expression of the N-terminal Monozinc Metallopeptidase Domain of APA with That of WT-APA—We investigated whether deletion of the C-terminal domain of APA affected the maturation of the N-terminal domain, by performing metabolic labeling and pulse-chase experiments with FLAG-WT-APA and FLAG-N-APA.

https://openalex.org/W2115487387,"We have analyzed the Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavages of Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+, with or without the ATP analog 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) or in the presence of the inhibitor thapsigargin. To identify the positions of cleavages as precisely as possible, we have used previously identified proteinase K and tryptic fragments as a standard, advanced mass spectrometry techniques, as well as specific antibodies. A number of cleavages are similar to those described for Na+,K+-ATPase or other P-type pumps and are expected on the basis of the putative Mg2+ binding residues near the phosphorylated Asp351 in E1 or E2P conformations. However, intriguing new features have also been observed. These include a Fe2+ site near M3, which cannot be due to the presence of histidine residues as it was postulated in the case of Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase. This site could represent a Ca2+ binding zone between M1 and M3, preceding Ca2+ occlusion within M4, 5, 6, and 8. In addition, we present evidence that, in the non-crystalline state, the N- and P-domain may approach each other, at least temporarily, in the presence of Ca2+ (E1Ca2 conformation), whereas the presence of Mg·ATP stabilizes the N to P interaction (E1·Mg·ATP conformation).

Ca2+-ATPase is a central member of the family of P-type cation-pumping ATPases (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 2Møller J.V.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) that actively transport cations (such as Ca2+,Na+,K+, and H+ or even heavy metals) by a mechanism involving the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate. The Ca2+-ATPase present in mature skeletal muscle, SERCA1a, contains 994 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of 110 kDa (3Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H. Cell. 1986; 44: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The protein has 10 trans-membrane spans M1-10 and a bulky cytosolic region, consisting of three major domains that are connected to the membrane-embedded part by a stalk. Two of these domains, the nucleotide binding domain (N) and the phosphorylation domain (P), are formed by the amino acid residues located between the membrane-spanning segments M4 and M5. The third domain (termed A) is formed from both the N-terminal tail and the amino acids located between segments M2 and M3. Recently, new structural and mechanistic information on this transport protein has been gained as a result of x-ray diffraction analysis of three-dimensional crystals of the protein (4Toyoshima C.

In combination with a wealth of other data obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (7Andersen J.P. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Vilsen B. Acta Physiol.

The tertiary structures of SERCA1a have been obtained by high resolution x-ray diffraction analysis of three-dimensional crystals produced from detergent-solubilized ATPase, either in the presence of Ca2+ (E1Ca2 conformation, Ref. 4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) or in the absence of Ca2+ but in the presence of the inhibitor thapsigargin (E2(Tg) conformation, Ref. 5Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The structure revealed in Ca2+ (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) is very “open” with little interaction between the cytosolic domains. By contrast, a much more compact structure was obtained in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting that cytosolic domains undergo large scale movements during the transition from one intermediate form to the other during catalysis (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). It is of interest that similar evidence of a compact E2 conformation accompanying active cation transport has emerged from detailed analysis of the degradation pattern, resulting from Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavages of Na+,K+-ATPase (Ref. 17Karlish S.J.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and references therein and Ref. 18Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48440-48450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This approach has turned out to give valuable information on the location of Mg2+ and ATP·Mg2+ binding sites and also suggestive evidence on interactions between cytoplasmic domains during the enzymatic cycle. Remarkably, the proximity of some residues, far removed from each other in the linear sequence, inferred by this approach (20Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9596-9601Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has later found striking support from the three-dimensional structures of SERCA1a (4Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 5Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (see “Discussion” in Ref. 19Shin J.M. Goldshleger R. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48440-48450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The key feature of the Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage approach is that a number of peptide bonds in the immediate vicinity of bound Fe2+ are cleaved by the very reactive OH· radicals produced by the Fenton reaction. Identification of the cleavage positions reveals their proximity in the native structure. Since Fe2+ can replace Mg2+ in its binding site, near the phosphorylation site or in the Mg·ATP complex, the identification of the various cuts is thought to reflect changes in the position of the Mg2+ site(s) in different conformations of the pumping cycle. In connection with these studies, the question arises as to the extent that information obtained with one ATPase type such as Na+,K+-ATPase, or its close relative H+,K+-ATPase, can be safely applied to other P-type ATPases, including SERCA, which is the only cation transporting ATPase for which a three-dimensional structure is available. However, extension of the Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage approach to other P-type ATPases has been limited so far. For Ca2+-ATPase, which is cleaved under these conditions (53Castilho R.F. Carvalho-Alves P.C. Vercesi A.E. Ferreira S.T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 159: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), Hua et al. (21Hua S. Inesi G. Nomura H. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11405-11410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have described Ca2+- and ATP-dependent cleavages around the phosphorylation site and at Thr441 in the N-domain, whereas Valiakhmetov and Perlin (22Valiakhmetov A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6330-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have reported ATP-dependent cleavage sites in the conserved C-terminal regions of proton ATPase. In this report, we describe in detail the Fe2+-catalyzed oxidative cleavages of SERCA1a. We find that applying this procedure to SERCA1a results in a rather large number of cleavage products with a pattern that is dependent on the conformation of the enzyme. As an alternative to N-terminal sequencing to identify the cleavage positions, which is usually not feasible after oxidative cleavage, we have estimated molecular masses of fragments as precisely as possible, by comparison with a number of well known SERCA1a proteolytic fragments, by the use of mass spectrometry techniques, and with specific antibodies. From these data, it has been possible to define, with a rather high degree of certainty, how the fragments can be accounted for by cleavage at relatively few positions, in a conformation-dependent manner. A number of cuts are similar to those described previously for the other pumps, but novel features are also emerging. Fe2+-catalyzed Oxidative Cleavage of Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase—Unless otherwise noted, all chemical products came from Sigma. SR membranes were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (23de Meis L. Hasselbach W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4759-4763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The membranes, stored at a protein concentration of 20-60 mg/ml, were resuspended at 0.4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 50 mm KCl either (i) with no Ca2+ added or (ii) with the addition of 0.1 mm Ca2+ or (iii) incubated with 50 μm thapsigargin (added to the suspension from a 1 mm thapsigargin stock solution in Me2SO). At pH 7.2, both the first and second condition stabilize the Ca2+-ATPase in an E1 conformation since the level of contaminating Ca2+ (∼10 μm) is sufficient to saturate the high affinity binding sites of Ca2+-ATPase, whereas the third condition (the addition of thapsigargin) stabilizes the Ca2+-ATPase in an E2(Tg) conformation (25Sagara Y. Fernandez-Belda F. de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12606-12613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were also performed at a lower pH, in a buffer containing 50 mm Mes, pH 5.5, 50 mm KCl, with or without the addition of 0.1 mm Ca2+ or 50 μm thapsigargin. The rationale for using pH 5.5 was, as suggested from previous findings (26Henao F. Orlowski S. Merah Z. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10302-10312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to bring the ATPase into an E2 conformation without the addition of thapsigargin or EGTA; the use of the latter in the present experiments is problematic since it chelates Fe2+ with an even higher affinity than Ca2+. Indirect evidence that, at pH 5.5 without added Ca2+, the ATPase is indeed present mainly in an E2 conformation was obtained from enzyme activity measurements. Whereas at pH 7.2, the ATPase was fully activated in the absence of added Ca2+, relative to that measured spectrophotometrically at 0.1 mm Ca2+ (27Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at pH 5.5, only 15% activation was observed. In the standard procedure for producing Fe2+-catalyzed fragments of Ca2+-ATPase by oxidative cleavage, we first incubated the membrane suspensions for 5 min at 4 °C with 10 μm FeSO4, added from a freshly prepared FeSO4 stock solution (1 mm), and then for 2 min at 20 °C before initiating the cleavage reaction by the addition of ascorbate/H2O2 at final concentrations of 5 or 10 mm ascorbate and 9 mm H2O2. The ascorbate and H2O2 were added from stock solutions of freshly prepared 200 mm ascorbic acid, 200 mm Tris (pH 7.2) or 200 mm ascorbic acid, 200 mm Mes (pH 5.5) and 90 mm hydrogen peroxide. After 5-60 min (usually 10 min), the reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA and deferoxamine (Sigma) at final concentrations of 20 and 4 mm, respectively. The membrane suspensions were chilled at 0 °C before the addition of equal volumes of a 2-fold concentrated gel sample buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, 4% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol, 8 m urea, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). After heating for 1 min at 100 °C, the samples were cooled for 5 min at room temperature before loading onto 10% 7 × 9 cm Laemmli gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper for Western blot analysis. For mass spectroscopy, samples were prepared as described above but with the following modifications. When the Fe2+-cleaved fragments were to be analyzed after extensive trypsinization, gels were first immersed for 10 min in a Coomassie Blue staining solution (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.1% Coomassie Blue R250) and destained with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1% glycerol until the bands could be seen. The bands were then excised onto a clean glass plate and stored in tubes with some acetic acid at 4 °C before trypsinization and mass spectrometry analysis (MALDI-TOF MS and nanoscale electrospray (nanoESI)-quadrupole-time of flight (Q-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)). The protein bands were in gel reduced and alkylated by dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide, respectively, before overnight enzymatic digestion with trypsin as described previously (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). When intact iron-cleaved fragments were to be analyzed, the iron cleavage incubation time was increased to 40 min to accumulate a maximum amount of the different fragments. After the cleavage reactions, the samples were centrifuged 15 min at ∼20000 × g on an MR22i JOUAN centrifuge at 4 °C. The membrane pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl or 50 mm Mes, pH 5.5, 50 mm KCl) and kept at 0 °C until the addition of equal volumes of a 2-fold concentrated gel sample buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8, 4% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1.4 m β-mercaptoethanol, 8 m urea, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). After heating for 1 min at 100 °C, the samples were left for 5 min at room temperature before loading onto 10% 16 × 16 cm Laemmli gels. Each lane contained about 80 μg/40 μl protein with 1 mm thioglycolate acid added to the cathode buffer. Depending on the type of mass spectrometry analysis, the gels were then processed differently. For analysis of the intact bands, the gel was stained over a period of 20 min in a GelCode solution (Perbio, Bezons, France) and destained in Milliporefiltrated water until the bands became visible. The bands were excised from the gel on a clean glass plate and kept at 4 °C. In another series of experiments, the intact fragments were examined by mass spectroscopy after blocking their sulfhydryl groups with iodoacetamide (see Table II, with alkylation). In that case, the samples were cleaved and centrifuged as before, but after centrifugation, the membrane pellets were suspended in 200 μl of a 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.5% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol and were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Iodoacetamide was then added at a final concentration of 250 mm, and the tubes were incubated for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Proteins were precipitated overnight at -20 °C by the addition of 4 volumes of a 2:1 methanol:ether solution.Table IIMALDI-TOF MS analysis on fragments of Ca2+ -ATPase or Na+, K+-ATPase electroeluted from SDS-gelsKnown (*) or predicted length of fragmentsCatalyst, site, domain, conformationPredicted massMALDI massDaDa ± S.E..Ca2+ ATPase(*) 1MEAAH...T181Fe2+ site I A20,38120,421 ± 32 (n = 3) (no alkylation)E2(Tg)1MEAAH...K436ATP·Fe2+ site I N47,66645,835 ± 426 (n = 6)437VEGA-C terminusE1·ATP·Fe61,88261,433 (n = 2) (with alkylation)1MEAAH...K329Fe2+ site I P36,14335,805 ± 168 (n = 6) (with alkylation)E1Ca2182GES...I622Fe2+ site I A, P48,08648,312 ± 183 (n = 4) (with alkylation)E2(Tg)1MEAAH...I622Fe2+ site I P68,44070,548 ± 90 (n = 4) (no alkylation)623MITG-C terminusE2(Tg)41,12841,528 ± 58 (n = 4) (no alkylation)41,963 ± 464 (n = 5) (with alkylation)Na+ K+ ATPase1GRDK...G213ATP·Fe2+ site I A E2P23,42123,196 ± 52 (n = 11)(*)214ESE-C terminus88,85289,814 ± 374 (n = 11) (with alkylation)1GRDK...G442ATP·Fe2+ site I N48,29648,562 (n = 2)443DASE-C terminusE1·ATP·Fe64,00364,427 (n = 2) (with alkylation)1GRDK...G711ATP·Fe2+ site I P77,74777,762 ± 102 (n = 6)(*)712VNDS-C-terminus34,55234,745 ± 109 (n = 8) (with alkylation)E1·ATP·Fe283HFIH-C terminusFe2+ site II M81,48181,999 (n = 2) (with alkylation)E2(K) or E1Na608MVTG-C terminusFe2+ site I P E2(K)45,61445,696 ± 124 (n = 5) (with alkylation) Open table in a new tab Fe2+-catalyzed Oxidative Cleavage of Renal Na+,K+-ATPase—Pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared as described (29Jørgensen P.L.

For preparation of samples to be analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, ∼3 mg of Na+,K+-ATPase was cleaved in one of the following conformational states. E2(Rb)·Fe2+ or E1Na·Fe2+ enzyme was suspended in media containing 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm RbCl (or 20 mm NaCl) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 μm FeSO4, 5 mm ascorbate, 5 mm H2O2; E1·ATP·Fe2+; the enzyme was suspended in a medium containing 50 μm AMP-PNP, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 7.4, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 5 μm FeSO4, 5 mm ascorbate, 5 mm H2O2; E2P·Fe2+ (see Table II): the enzyme was incubated with 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm ATP, and 50 μm FeSO4 for 2 min at 0 °C;1mm ouabain was then added, and after 1 min, 4 mm deferoxamine (Sigma), 20 mm ascorbate, and 20 mm H2O2 were added, and the suspension was incubated for a further 4 min. At the end of each incubation, the cleavage reactions were arrested by the addition of 10 mm deferoxamine, 10 mm EDTA, and the membranes were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a medium containing 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm RbCl. The enzyme (0.5 mg/ml) was then solubilized with an equal volume of the non-ionic detergent C12E10 (1.5 mg/ml), and undissolved protein was removed by centrifugation. Protein was further precipitated from the detergent solution by the addition of 4 volumes of methanol:ether 3:1 (v:v) overnight at -20 °C and collected by centrifugation. The precipitated protein was dissolved in 0.5% SDS, applied to a TSK-3000 size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography column, and eluted with a solution of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.1% SDS (32Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 mm dithiothreitol was added to each fraction, and after an overnight incubation at 4 °C, solid iodoacetamide was added to 250 mm and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then 50 mm dithiothreitol was added to quench the excess of iodoacetamide. The protein was precipitated again with 4 volumes of methanol:ether and collected. Protein was dissolved in 5-fold concentrated gel sample buffer with 5 mm EDTA added. Fragments were separated on long 10% Tricine-SDS gels, which were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and/or colloidal stain GelCode (Pierce). Preparation of Cleavage Fragments for Intact Mass Measurements by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry, Electroelution of Protein, and Exchange of SDS by Deoxycholate—Electroelution of protein from pieces of the SDS-gels was performed in GeBAflex-tubes (Gene Bio Application Ltd., Kfar Hanagid, Israel) at 150 V for 2 h (see Ref. 33, Mehlman, T., Benjamin, M., Merhav, D., Osman, F., Ben-Asouli, Y., Goldshleger, R., Karlish, S., and Shainskaya, A. (2002) Proceedings of the 50th Conference of American Society for Mass Spectrometry, June 2-6, 2002, Orlando, FL, American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Orlando, FLGoogle Scholar). The elution buffer contained 0.025% SDS, 25 mm Tris, and 250 mm Tricine, pH 8.5. Following electroelution, SDS was efficiently removed by precipitating the protein solution with 50% trichloracetic acid in the presence of 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in the cold acetone and centrifuged again after overnight incubation at -20 °C to remove traces of unbound NaDOC, and samples were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Acetone can also be replaced by methanol. Estimation of the protein recovery was performed by densitometric analysis. MALDI-TOF-Mass Spectrometry of Whole Fragments—Aliquots of the electroeluted proteins dissolved in 80% formic acid, followed by dilution to a final concentration of 10% formic acid and immediate sonication for 5 min at 30 °C, were used for MALDI-TOF MS by using dry droplet (34Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spect. 1996; 10: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) methods. 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic was used as matrixes for analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Bruker Reflex III™ MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a delayed extraction ion source, a reflector, and a 337-nm nitrogen laser. Analysis of Protein Digests by MALDI-TOF MS and nanoESI-Q-TOF MS and MS/MS—The tryptic digests were analyzed first in reflector mode on an Applied Biosystems STR MALDI TOF mass spectrometer (Applera, Framingham, MA) equipped with a delayed extraction ion source and a 337-nm N2 laser to generate a peptide mass fingerprint, and then they were analyzed by nanoESI MS/MS using a hybrid nanoESI quadrupoletime of flight mass spectrometer (Q-T of 2, Waters, Micromass, Manchester, UK) in direct infusion mode with metal-coated glass capillaries (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). In automatic mode, data acquisition was realized by switching between the survey acquisition in MS mode and fragmentation acquisition in MS/MS mode on the four most intense ions detected in the former survey scan and using dynamic exclusion afterward. Mass data collected during an analysis were processed and converted into a pkl file using the Masslynx™ software (Micromass) to be submitted to the search software Mascot (www.matrixscience.com). Protein identifications were obtained by comparison of experimental data with the NCBInr data base. In manual mode, bi- or tri-protonated precursors were selected for fragmentation and were manually processed using the Peptide Sequencing software (Masslynx™, Waters). Other Methods—ATPase activities were measured at 23 °C with an ATP generating system (27Møller J.V. Lind K.E. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1912-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm Mes (pH adjusted to 5.5, 6, or 7 with NaOH), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg·ATP, and 5 mm Mg2+, without or with 0.1 mm added Ca2+. For estimation of molecular masses, the electrophoretic mobility of the Fe2+-cleaved fragments was compared with that of well known proteolytic cleavage products (35Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L.

Tryptic peptides were obtained by treating Ca2+-ATPase (2 mg protein/ml) with trypsin (0.04 mg/ml) for 5-120 min at 20 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Mes-Tris, pH 6, 50 mm NaCl, and either 2 mm EGTA or 0.1 mm Ca2+. The reaction was stopped by trypsin inhibitor (0.1 mg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) as described previously (36le Maire M. Lund S. Viel A. Champeil P. Møller J.V. J. Biol.

The Na+,K+-ATPase C-terminal antibody anti-KETYY was described previously (32Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Fe2+-catalyzed Oxidative Cleavage—Fig. 1 shows the effect of a wide range of Fe2+ concentrations on the oxidative cleavage of Ca2+-ATPase in the presence of ascorbate and H2O2. As can be seen, many bands appear on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, particularly in the E2 conformation induced by the addition of thapsigargin (Tg). Extensive cleavage is observed at 10-50 μm Fe2+, but it is also possible to induce cleavage at very low Fe2+ concentrations. Thus, fragments are already visible at 0.5 μm Fe2+ provided that ascorbate and H2O2 are not below a concentration of about 10 mm. At the protein concentration used in these experiments, the Ca2+-ATPase is present at about 3 μm; thus, the Fe2+/Ca2+-ATPase molar ratio i"

The mechanisms downstream of JNK that regulate cell cycle progression and transformation are unclear. Here we show that inhibition of JNK2, but not JNK1, with either a dominant-negative mutant, a pharmacological inhibitor, or RNA interference caused an accumulation of mammalian cells with 4N DNA content. When observed by immunofluorescence, these cells progressed to metaphase without apparent defects in spindle formation or chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate, suggesting that the 4N accumulation is a result of postmetaphase defects. Consistent with this prediction, when JNK activity was suppressed, we observed defects in central spindle formation and chromosome segregation during anaphase. In contrast, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 activity, cyclin B1 protein, and Polo-like kinase 1 protein turnover remained intact when JNK was inhibited. In addition, continued inhibition of JNK activity did not block reentry into subsequent cell cycles but instead resulted in polyploidy. This evidence suggests that JNK2 functions in maintaining the genomic stability of mammalian cells by signaling that is independent of cyclin-dependent kinase 1/cyclin B1 down-regulation.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases are components of signal transduction pathways that connect extracellular stimuli to intracellular responses such as modulation of cell viability, cell cycle regulation, and gene expression (1Weston C.R. Lambright D.G. Davis R.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2345-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Potapova O. Gorospe M. Bost F. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Mercola D. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed and are generally considered to share redundant functions in apoptosis and transformation and differential functions in T cell differentiation (3Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the stress-induced proapoptotic function previously attributed to both isoforms is actually a function specific to JNK1 (7Hreniuk D. Garay M. Gaarde W. Monia B.P. McKay R.A. Cioffi C.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Hochedlinger K. Wagner E.F. Sabapathy V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The function of JNK2, therefore, has become less clear. This suggests that JNK functions in transformation may also be isoform-specific and should be addressed in a way that differentiates between the contributions of JNK1 and JNK2. Ras-activating mutations have been identified in close to 30% of human cancers (9Adjei A.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1062-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Transformation by Ras requires JNK activity, which has made JNK an attractive target for cancer therapy (10Raitano A.B. Halpern J.R. Hambuch T.M. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11746-11750Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2634-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 12Manning A.M. Davis R.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Targeting JNK for cancer therapy is also supported by studies showing that JNK activity is elevated in human tumors and that loss of JNK function inhibits tumor growth in mice (13Papachristou D.J. Batistatou A. Sykiotis G.P. Varakis I. Papavassiliou A. Bone. 2003; 32: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Antonyak M. Kenyon L.C. Godwin A.K. James D.C. Emlet D.R. Okamoto I.

The transforming mechanism downstream of JNK is not entirely clear, but it may work through the phosphorylation of c-Jun, which in turn regulates transcription of cell cycle regulators. In addition to this pathway, JNK may have a more direct function in cell cycle regulation. We have shown that JNK localizes to centrosomes and is active in this compartment from early S phase through late anaphase with peak activity at metaphase (17MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A. Goodrich D.W. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While total soluble JNK activity also increases during mitosis (18Fan M. Du L. Stone A.A. Gilbert K.M. Chambers T.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6403-6407PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), neither JNK1 nor JNK2 has been shown to function in mitosis. To address whether JNK1 or JNK2 functions in mitosis, we used three loss of function approaches: blocking JNK activation by ectopic overexpression of a JNK dominant-negative mutant, inhibiting JNK activity with the specific pharmacological inhibitor SP600125, and down-regulating JNK isoform expression with RNA interference. The mammalian cell lines used in this study include human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells, human small lung carcinoma (Calu-1), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. All three methods produced an accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content. The cells with 4N DNA content were shown to be multinucleate cells with decondensed DNA rather than cells blocked in a particular stage of mitosis. Examination of the morphology of cells progressing through mitosis in the presence of JNK inhibitor suggests that polyploidy results from defects in chromosome segregation and central spindle formation during anaphase B. RNA interference showed that the loss of the JNK2 isoform, but not the JNK1 isoform, produced an accumulation of 4N cells. At later time points, apoptotic or polyploid populations were elevated depending on cell type, suggesting that whether multinucleate cells would be eliminated or reenter subsequent cell cycles was dependent on cellular context. We also found that while inhibition of JNK delayed mitotic progression, it did not delay cyclin B1 degradation or down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity. This suggests that JNK may regulate anaphase progression through a mechanism further downstream of or independent of Cdk1/cyclin B1. Cell Culture—Derivation of Calu-1 7-5, 8-5, and 8-30 clones has been described previously (20Tchou W.W. Yie T.A. Tan T.-H. Rom W.N. Tchou-Wong K.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6974-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Additional clones were derived by limiting dilution of Calu-1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-JNK(T183A,Y185F) dominant-negative mutant, abbreviated as JNK(APF), and selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. CHO, human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human small lung carcinoma (Calu-1), and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Synchronization—For the metaphase block, CHO cells were plated at 70% confluency on acid-etched poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and allowed to attach for 4 h. Attached cells were synchronized by blocking in early S phase with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h, releasing in fresh media for 5 h, and then blocking in mitosis with 0.05 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 5 h. Synchronized cells were gently washed with fresh media, returned to 37 °C, and fixed at 15-min intervals. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) or Me2SO carrier alone was added to cultures 30 min prior to release from nocodazole treatment and to the fresh media following mitotic release as indicated. The final concentration of Me2SO in all samples was 0.1%. For the double thymidine block, HeLa cells were incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 20 h, released into fresh media for 8 h, incubated with 2 mm thymidine for 15 h, and then released into fresh media for 4.5 h before addition of 0.1% Me2SO or 0.1% Me2SO with 15 μm SP600125. Immunofluorescence—For all immunofluorescence experiments, cells were plated on acid-etched, polylysine-coated glass coverslips. Plated cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Coverslips were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 3 min followed by three 5-min washes in PEM buffer (80 mm K-PIPES (pH 7.6), 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 20 min and washed with TBST (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with primary antibodies diluted in TBST, washed in TBST, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with secondary antibodies diluted 1:400 in TBST. After washing in TBST, coverslips were counterstained with 0.4 μg/ml of 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in TBST and mounted with ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes). The antibodies used for immunofluorescence were: anti-β-tubulin (17MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A. Goodrich D.W. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), anti-pericentrin (BabCo/Covance, Denver, CO), goat anti-rabbit, and mouse IgG (heavy + light) conjugated to Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a Zeiss AxioPlan2 Microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and CoolSnap HQ CCD using MetaView software. Brightness adjustment, channel overlay, and figure arrangement was done with Adobe Photoshop software. Western Blotting—The antibodies used for Western blotting were: anti-hemagglutinin (Sigma), anti-FLAG (Roche Applied Science), anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-JNK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) and anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-aldolase (Biodesign International, Saco, ME), anti-cyclin B1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Protein concentrations of samples were quantified by Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST, incubated for 1 h in TBST containing primary antibody, washed three times (7 min each) in TBST, incubated for 1 h in TBST containing secondary antibody, and washed three times (7 min each) in TBST. Signal was developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Signal was quantified using Kodak 1D version 3.5.3 software (Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT). Flow Cytometry—Cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and incubated with 200 μg/ml RNase (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. A 4-fold volume of 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline was added, and samples were analyzed on a Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometry system equipped with Beckman System II v3 flow analysis software. For determination of percentages of polyploid cells, gates were set to exclude nonviable cells based on forward and side scatter profiles. To quantitate sub-G0 events, samples were not gated on forward or side scatter. For determination of percentages of cells in S or 4N stages, gates were set to exclude nonviable and polyploid cells so that percentages could be accurately compared between samples. A minimum of 10,000 events were counted per sample. Microtubule Nucleation Assay—CHO cells were plated on coverslips, cultured overnight, and treated with 5 × 10-6m nocodazole in 37 °C preheated media for 1.5 h. Inhibitors or carrier alone was added to the media for an additional 30 min. Coverslips were transferred to fresh preheated media containing inhibitors or carrier alone for 5-15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and then gently fixed in ice-cold methanol for 3 min. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—The 2′-ACE-stabilized, duplexed siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) and desalted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINE (transfection following plasmid transfection, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western blots showing reduction of endogenous protein, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (Sigma) was included at a concentration of 100 mm in all cultures post-transfection. Cdk1 Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 50 mm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. Lysate (100 μg) was incubated with anti-Cdk1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C, and then protein A-agarose beads were added for an additional 30 min. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer and incubated with 10 μg of histone H1 (Sigma), 15 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Sample proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. To determine whether JNK activity is important for cell cycle progression, human small lung carcinoma (Calu-1), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and CHO cells were treated with SP600125, a pharmacological inhibitor of JNK (21Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). We focused on phenotypes that were common to all three cell lines and independent of differences in cellular background. The minimal effective dose of SP600125 was first determined in CHO cells to be 15 μm, which inhibited 80% of JNK activity (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, SP600125 showed no inhibition of the related kinase p38 below 15 μm in CHO cell culture as assessed by quantifying phosphorylation of its substrate, CREB (Fig. 1C). So that it could be used as a control, the effective dose of the p38 inhibitor SB202190 in CHO cell culture was determined. The IC50 for inhibition of p38 in CHO cell culture was 8.5 μm with 25 μm providing 70% inhibition of p38 and only 2% inhibition of JNK (Fig. 1C). Treatment of Calu-1, HeLa, and CHO cells with 15 μm SP600125 for 72 h caused a 2.0-fold increase in S phase HeLa cells but not Calu-1 or CHO cells (Table I). This accumulation of S phase cells is, therefore, dependent on cellular background. More interestingly, this treatment caused an accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content in all three cell lines. Specifically treatment of Calu-1, HeLa, and CHO cells with 15 μm SP600125 for 72 h caused 1.6-fold (p = 0.004), 3.5-fold (p = 0.009), and 3.0-fold (p = 0.000) increases in tetraploid cells, respectively (Fig. 1D and Table I). To further confirm this observation, we screened Calu-1 small lung carcinoma clones expressing a dominant-negative mutant, FLAG-human JNK(APF), for changes in cell cycle distribution (20Tchou W.W. Yie T.A. Tan T.-H. Rom W.N. Tchou-Wong K.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6974-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FLAG-JNK(APF) expression was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). When plated at equal density and cultured for 18 h, JNK(APF)-expressing cultures had increased percentages of cells with 4N DNA content (Fig. 2B).Table ISP600125 effects on multiple cell linesCell line and SP600125 concentrationPercent S phaseRelative-foldPercent 4NRelative-foldPercent 4N+Relative-foldCHO38.5 ± 2.81.020.6 ± 3.11.09.95 ± 1.11.07.5 μm43.6 ± 2.01.120.8 ± 0.81.013.6 ± 1.41.415 μm32.3 ± 2.50.861.5 ± 2.83.080.8 ± 2.88.1Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa)12.9 ± 0.91.08.7 ± 0.71.01.2 ± 0.31.015 μm25.9 ± 0.52.030.3 ± 2.93.55.5 ± 0.74.6Small lung carcinoma (Calu-1)28.1 ± 2.51.020.4 ± 1.71.03.2 ± 0.71.07.5 μm30.9 ± 0.61.121.8 ± 1.11.13.8 ± 0.51.215 μm21.4 ± 0.90.831.9 ± 3.01.611.1 ± 0.93.5 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Inhibition of JNK produces tetraploid cell accumulation.A, stable Calu cell lines express FLAG-tagged JNK(T183A,Y185F) (also called FLAG-JNK(APF)) dominant-negative mutant.

B, dominant-negative cells lines have increased percentages of cells with 4N DNA content. Calu clones were plated, incubated for 18 h, and analyzed by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry for DNA content. C, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with vector (-), hemagglutinin-tagged JNK1 (HA-JNK1), or FLAG-tagged JNK2, incubated for 4 h, and then transfected with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA. After an additional 20 h, anti-actin, anti-hemagglutinin, and anti-FLAG Western blotting was performed. D, HeLa cells were transfected with fluorescently labeled control siRNA (Fluor. siRNA), JNK1 siRNA, or JNK2 siRNA. After 48 h, anti-actin, anti-JNK1, and anti-JNK2 Western blotting was performed. E and F, reduction of JNK2 expression in HeLa and Calu cells causes accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content.

The specificity of JNK1- and JNK2-targeting siRNAs was tested by transfecting HeLa cells with hemagglutinin epitope-tagged JNK1 or FLAG epitope-tagged JNK2 followed by transfection with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA. After 24 h, expression of JNK1 and JNK2 was assessed by Western blotting against the epitope tags. Treatment of HeLa cells with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNAs specifically blocked greater than 95% of JNK1 and JNK2 expression, respectively (Fig. 2C). The effects of reducing JNK expression on cell cycle progression were determined by transfecting HeLa and Calu cells with isoform-specific siRNAs and analyzing their cell cycle profiles with propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Changes in cell cycle profiles were first observed at 72 h post-transfection. Down-regulation of JNK1 expression did not produce significant changes in the percentage of viable cells with 4N DNA content (Fig. 2, D and E). However, down-regulation of JNK2 produced a 2-fold accumulation of viable cells with 4N DNA content in both HeLa and Calu cells by 96 and 120 h, respectively (Fig. 2, D and E). These data show that JNK2, but not JNK1, is critical for proper mitotic progression in human cells. The increase in the 4N cell population suggests that JNK inhibition causes a mitotic block or prolonged G2/M progression. However, the accumulation of 4N cells could also be the result of an accumulation of cells that have not undergone proper chromosome segregation during one cell cycle but have still exited mitosis and reentered G0/G1. In the latter case, subsequent rounds of the cell cycle would be expected to produce cells with greater than 4N DNA content. To test this hypothesis, polyploidy was assessed in HeLa, Calu-1, and CHO cells treated with SP600125. CHO cells were treated with increasing doses of SP600125 for 72 h. Accumulation of polyploid cells was observed with as little as 7 μm SP600125 with 90% of the cells becoming polyploid in the presence of 10 μm SP600125 (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, neither of the p38 inhibitors SB202190 and SB203580 nor the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 caused polyploidy (Fig. 3A). Treatment of Calu-1, HeLa, and CHO cells with 15 μm SP600125 for 72 h caused 3.5-fold (p = 0.000), 4.6-fold (p = 0.001), and 8.1-fold (p = 0.000) increases in polyploid cells, respectively (Table I). Similar results were seen with Calu clones expressing the dominant-negative JNK(APF) mutant. When the clones were assessed for DNA content by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, up to a 15-fold increase in polyploidy was observed in high expressing clones, and up to a 12-fold increase was observed in low expressing clones (Fig. 3, C-F). No significant increases in polyploidy were detected in JNK siRNA-treated cultures by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2F). One possible reason that we did not observe polyploidy with the JNK siRNA is that the efficiency of JNK inhibition using siRNA may be below the threshold for detecting the polyploid phenotype. Alternatively the slower nature of this inhibition method, which requires degradation of pre-existing protein, could suggest that the polyploid cells do not survive in culture long enough to detect an accumulation. In support of this, JNK2 siRNA caused a significantly increased sub-G0 population, which is indicative of DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 3G). Thus, it is possible that over longer time periods the fate of polyploid cells that result from specific JNK2 inhibition is apoptosis. This function of JNK2 in protecting cells from apoptosis contrasts with the known function of JNK1 in promoting apoptosis. The pharmacological JNK inhibitor SP600125 and the JNK(APF) dominant-negative mutant inhibit both the JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms. Thus, if the polyploid cells would have normally undergone apoptosis in a JNK1-dependent manner, SP600125 and the dominant-negative mutant would have blocked this process. This could also explain why the loss of polyploid cells and apoptosis are only detected when JNK2 function is inhibited without inhibiting JNK1. To determine which stage of mitosis was defective, cells were treated with carrier, 20 μm SP600125, 20 μm SB202190, or 20 μm SB203580 for 72 h and their mitotic morphology was assessed by DAPI DNA staining and microscopy. CHO cells treated with SP600125, did not appear to be blocked in any stage of mitosis. However, the treated cells had enlarged and multilobed nuclei, which were not seen in cells treated with carrier or the p38 inhibitors (Fig. 4A). SP600125 also produced multinuclei in HeLa and Calu-1 cells. Similar enlarged and multilobed nuclei were detected in the Calu clones expressing the JNK dominant-negative mutant (Fig. 4B). To determine whether this was a specific effect of the JNK2 isoform, HeLa and Calu cells were treated with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA and assessed for mitotic morphology by immunofluorescence. Cells were transfected with siRNA for 96 h and then stained with anti-β-tubulin and DAPI DNA stain to visualize the microtubules and DNA, respectively. As expected, JNK2, but not JNK1, siRNA caused a 4-fold accumulation of HeLa cells with enlarged and multilobed nuclei (Fig. 4, C and E). This indicates that JNK2, but not JNK1, is required for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis in HeLa cells. These RNA interference-induced multinuclei, present after one cell cycle (HeLa and Calu-1) with reduced JNK expression, were more defined and less globular than the multinuclei seen with the long term pharmacological JNK inhibition (HeLa, Calu-1, and CHO) and the chronic suppression of JNK activity in the dominant-negative JNK-expressing Calu-derived clones (Fig. 4, A and B). However, all three methods produced cells with enlarged nuclei, showing that chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during mitosis did not occur when JNK was inhibited. Interestingly neither JNK1 nor JNK2 siRNA significantly altered the overall percentage of cells morphologically progressing through mitosis as assessed by microscopy (Fig. 4D). Therefore, because these cells were not blocked in a specific stage of mitosis, the nature of the defect leading to multinucleation was not clear. Although the inhibition of JNK appears to affect S phase progression in HeLa cells, CHO and Calu-1 cells progressed normally through S phase in the presence of JNK inhibitor (Table I). This suggests that the defect leading to multinucleation, which was common to all three cell lines, was occurring after S phase. To determine whether cells were properly progressing through G2 and mitosis when JNK was inhibited, analysis of cellular morphology by immunofluorescence was performed. Several possible mechanisms may account for the multinucleation observed in cells depleted of JNK activity, including defects in chromosome condensation during G2, chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate, spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. To determine whether JNK inhibition caused defects in global microtubule nucleation and/or growth, CHO cells were treated with nocodazole to depolymerize existing cytoskeletal microtubules. Nocodazole was then washed from the cell culture, and microtubules were allowed to nucleate and regrow at 37 °C in fresh cell culture media. Microtubule nucleation and regrowth were intact in the presence of 25 μm SP600125, suggesting that JNK is not required for these processes (Fig. 5A). More importantly, morphologically normal bipolar spindles with chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate are present in HeLa, Calu-1, and CHO cells treated for 24 h with 15 μm SP600125. This indicates that in mammalian cells, chromosome condensation, chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate, and spindle formation do not require JNK activity (Fig. 5B and data not shown). To determine whether defects occurred after metaphase during chromosome segregation of anaphase A and B, CHO and HeLa cells were first synchronized in metaphase with a single thymidine block followed by a nocodazole block. Synchronized cells were then released into fresh culture media, followed through anaphase in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitor by fixation every 15 min, and visualized by immunofluorescence imaging. In the absence of SP600125, central spindle formation, midbody formation, and cytokinesis were detected at 30, 45, and 60 min, respectively (Fig. 6A and data not shown). In the presence of SP600125, sister chromatid separation was initiated during anaphase A. However, central spindle formation during anaphase B, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis were defective (Fig. 6, A and B, and data not shown). SP600125 produced chromosome segregation defects in over 90% of anaphase cells (Fig. 6C). In contrast, an inhibitor of the related mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 did not cause chromosome segregation defects (Fig. 6C). These results"

Despite a high percentage of identical amino acids in their sequences, orthologues of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) in different mammals differ in their specificity for terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc. The recombinant subunit 1 of the ASGP-R from the rat (RHL-1 or rat hepatic lectin) and the mouse (MHL-1 or mouse hepatic lectin), which differ at only 12 positions in the amino acid sequence of their carbohydrate recognition domains, binds Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man-bovine serum albumin and GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man-bovine serum albumin in ratios of 16:1.0 and 1.0:1.0, respectively. Mutagenesis was used to show that amino acids both in the immediate vicinity of the proposed binding site for terminal GalNAc and on the α2 helix that is distant from the binding site contribute to the specificity for terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc. Thus, multiple amino acid sequence alterations in two key locations contribute to the difference in specificity observed for the rat and mouse ASGP-Rs. We hypothesize that the altered specificity of ASPG-R orthologues in such evolutionarily closely related species reflects rapidly changing requirements for recognition of endogenous or exogenous oligosaccharides in vivo.

A characteristic of the receptor is its ability to rapidly remove glycoproteins from the circulation that have been treated with neuraminidase or mild acid (2Morell A.G. Gregoriadis G. Scheinberg I.H. Hickman J. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1461-1467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid clearance reflects the specificity of the ASGP-R for terminal β-linked galactose (Gal) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues that are exposed by the removal of terminal sialic acid (Sia). The ASGP-R was subsequently shown to be a hetero-oligomer consisting of two highly homologous subunits, hepatic lectin subunits 1 and 2 (HL-1 and HL-2, respectively) (3Holland E.C. Leung J.O.

Whereas both subunits are required for the endocytosis of ligands, the carbohydrate binding activity is associated predominantly with HL-1 (6Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prior structural and functional studies of the ASGP-R have included the crystallization of human HL-1 (8Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the generation of mice with genetically ablated HL-2 (9Braun J.R. Willnow T.E. Ishibashi S. Ashwell G. Herz J. J. Biol.

These studies have been informative but have not revealed the identity of endogenous ligands that may be recognized by the ASGP-R in vivo. We recently reported that, in the rat, the ASGP-R mediates the rapid clearance of bovine serum albumin bearing multiple chemically coupled tetrasaccharides with the sequence Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,2Man (Siaα2,6GGnM-bovine serum albumin (BSA)) (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because the prolactin-like hormones bearing N-linked oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc are synthesized during the last third of pregnancy in the placenta of the rat (12Manzella S.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), they may represent the first examples of endogenous ligands for the ASGP-R. Although rare, the terminal sequence Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc has been found on a number of glycoproteins in addition to the prolactin-like hormones (12Manzella S.M. Dharmesh S.M. Cohick C.B.

Easton R.L. Panico M. Patankar M. Oehniger S. Koistinen R. Koistinen H. Seppala M. Clark G.F. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 597-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The presence of these structures on multiple glycoproteins raises the possibility that the ASGP-R in other mammalian species may also recognize oligosaccharides terminating with the sequence Siaα2,6GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc. The ASGP-R is expressed by all of the mammals that have been examined (17Ashwell G. Harford J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 531-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of HL-1 and HL-2 have high percentages of identical residues across species. For example, mouse HL-1 (MHL-1) and human HL-1 (HHL-1) are 89 and 80% identical to rat HL-1 (RHL-1), respectively, whereas MHL-2 and HHL-2 are 80 and 62% identical to RHL-2, respectively. Since all of the known mammalian HLs share a specificity for terminal Gal or GalNAc (17Ashwell G. Harford J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 531-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), the conservation of amino acid sequence among mammalian HL orthologues suggested that, like RHL-1, HLs from other species may also bind terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc. The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of HL-1 is the prototypical example of a Ca2+-dependent CRD (18Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A comparison of the binding sites of HL-1 and the CRD domain of the mannose (Man)-binding protein allowed Drickamer and co-workers (19Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 20Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 21Ng K.K. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 663-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to propose a model for GalNAc binding to HL-1. Based on this model, residues that determine the specificity for GalNAc versus Man were identified and a form of the Man-binding protein that binds GalNAc was engineered. In this model, the C6 hydroxyl of the bound GalNAc projects away from the protein. This model has not yet been confirmed by the crystallization of HL-1 with a carbohydrate in the binding site; however, it suggests that the binding site of HL-1 could potentially accommodate a sialic acid linked to the C6 hydroxyl of bound Gal or GalNAc. Here we report that mammalian ASGP-Rs differ in their ability to bind terminal GalNAc and Siaα2,6GalNAc. Furthermore, multiple changes in the amino acid sequence of HL-1 both in the immediate region of the binding pocket and at more distant sites contribute to the difference in specificity. Taken together, the changes in the amino acid sequence and ligand binding properties of these orthologues raise the possibility that the specificity of the ASGP-R may have changed to accommodate a need to recognize different endogenous and/or exogenous carbohydrate structures. Materials—Bovine, chicken, mouse, porcine, rat, and rabbit livers were purchased from Pel-Freeze® Biologicals (Rogers, AK). BSA conjugated with an average of 15 trisaccharides with the sequence Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and the desialylated GGnM-BSA were prepared as previously described (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). TRIzol reagent and primers were purchased from Invitrogen. Radiolabeling of proteins with [125I], isolation of total liver membrane proteins, and receptor:ligand binding assays were performed as previously described (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the concentration of Ca2+ was increased from 2 to 10 mm in the binding assays. Preparation of Total Liver Membrane Proteins—Livers were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) in 5 volumes of buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) sucrose. Homogenates were sedimented at 1,500 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants were layered over a 65% (w/v) sucrose cushion prior to sedimentation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 75 min. The interphase fraction, which contained the total membrane proteins, was collected and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) or the Non-Interfering Protein Assay™ (Geno Technologies, St. Louis, MO). Expression of Mouse, Rat, and Human Hepatic Lectin Subunits 1 and 2—MHL-1 and MHL-2 were cloned and expressed in 293T cells as described for RHL-1 and RHL-2 (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MHL-1 and MHL-2 were amplified using the gene-specific primers MHL-1-F (5′-CGG GAT CCC ATC ATG ACA AAG GAT TAT CAA GAT TTC C-3′) and MHL-1-ΔR(5′-GCG TGC ACC CCC ATT AGC CTT ATC CAA CTT TGT CTC-3′), MHL-2-F (5′-CGG GAT CCC ATC ATG GAG AAG GAC TTT CAA GAT ATC C-3′) and MHL-2-ΔR(5′-GCG TCG ACC CTA GTG GGT GAT GTT CCG TCT CTT TTC G-3′), respectively. Amplified products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5His-TOPO and sequenced. The resulting cDNAs of subunits 1 and 2 were designated MHL-1V5His and MHL-2V5His, respectively. To express the subunits with the V5 epitope and six histidines, the stop codon was changed to encode for a Gly residue followed by a SalI restriction enzyme site. Hepatic Lectin Subunit 1 Amino Acid Changes—Standard molecular techniques were used to make HL-1 amino acid changes. The XcmI site at amino acid residues 156–157 was used to swap CRD-containing regions. Codon-specific mutageneses were performed using Inverse PCR. Changes were confirmed by sequencing. These constructs were expressed in HEK-293T cells, solubilized in Triton X-100, separated on NuPAGE® Bis-Tris gels, and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore). Quantitative Western blots were performed using mouse anti-V5 IgG and rabbit anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase to determine the expression levels by comparison to known amounts of V5-tagged proteins. Bacterial Expression of CRD Regions—Constructs for bacterial expression of the CRD region of mouse and rat HL-1 were similar to those described by Iobst and Drickamer (22Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in which the amino acid residues from 1 to 149 were deleted. In our constructs, the termination codon was replaced with a glycine-encoding triplet to fuse the CRD with V5 and six histidines. CRD region and the tags were amplified using 5′-GATGATTAACATATGGCCCGAGCCTTCGTTCGAAGGATCTCCTGCCCCATCAACTGG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGG-3′ oligonucleotides. MHL-1V5His and RHL-1V5His served as templates. Amplified product were digested with NdeI and PmeI enzymes and inserted into the NdeI and XhoI (Mung bean nuclease-treated) sites of the pET22b(+) vector. The constructs were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen) and solubilized from inclusion bodies using 7 m guanidine-HCL. Refolding by dilution and dialysis was performed as described previously (22Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The constructs were enriched by nickel chelate affinity chromatography on nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Invitrogen). The active forms of the constructs were affinity-purified on GalNAcβ-agarose (Calbiochem) as described previously (22Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Designations M1-CRDV5His and R1-CRDV5His were assigned for the mouse and rat CRDs, respectively. The binding activities of the CRDs were examined using one pmol of each purified CRD. Mammals Differ in Their Capacity to Bind Oligosaccharides Terminating with Siaα2,6GalNAc and GalNAc—We recently reported that bovine serum albumin bearing multiple chemically conjugated tetrasaccharides terminating with the sequence Siaα2,6GGnM is rapidly removed from the circulation of the rat following injection (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Subunit 1of the rat asialoglycoprotein receptor RHL-1 binds Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA as well as GGnM-BSA and can account for the rapid clearance of both glycoconjugates from the blood. We examined the livers of other mammals to determine whether this specificity is universal or confined to the livers of specific mammals such as the rat. Triton X-100-soluble membrane proteins from rabbit, rat, bovine, mouse, and porcine liver displayed activity for GGnM-BSA (Fig. 1A). A 7-fold range in binding activity per microgram of membrane protein was observed with rabbit having the highest range of activity and pig having the lowest activity. Rabbit and rat liver extracts displayed equal or better activity for Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA than for GGnM-BSA (Fig. 1B). In contrast, bovine, mouse, and pig liver extracts displayed little binding activity for Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA. Since we previously determined that the ASGP-R could account for the Siaα2,6GalNAc-specific binding activity in rat liver, the difference in the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA:GGnM-BSA binding activity seen in livers from different mammals (Fig. 1C) suggested that orthologues of the ASGP-R in these species may differ in their saccharide specificities. Recombinant subunits 1 (HL-1) and 2 (HL-2) of the ASGP-R from rat, mouse, and human were individually expressed in HEK-293T cells, and their ability to bind GGnM-BSA and Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA was compared. RHL-1, MHL-1, and HHL-1 each bound GGnM-BSA, whereas HL-2 as observed previously (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) did not show significant binding activity in all three species (data not shown). Using 125I-labeled Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and GGnM-BSA that had identical specific activities, the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA bound by the same amount of HL-1 subunit was 15.7-fold higher for RHL-1 than for MHL-1. Thus, the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA binding activity is higher for both the native and recombinant forms of the rat ASGP-R compared with the native and recombinant forms of the mouse ASGP-R (Fig. 2). Similar to MHL-1, recombinant HHL-1 did not exhibit enhanced binding of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA compared with GGnM-BSA (data not shown), indicating that the specificity of the human receptor more closely resembles that of the mouse than that of the rat. Identification of the Amino Acids Required for Recognition of Siaα2,6GalNAcβ—When aligned with MHL-1 and HHL-1 (Fig. 2A), the amino acid sequence of RHL-1 is 88.7% identical to MHL-1 and 78.4% identical to HHL-1 (data not shown), indicating that a limited number of alterations in their amino acid sequences account for the difference in specificity. Chimeric HL-1 subunits were used to establish that changes within the CRD of rat and mouse HL-1 rather than within the cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions predominantly account for the difference in specificity. The cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions of RHL-1 (residues 1–152) were replaced by the cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions of MHL-1 (Fig. 2B, Mut-A) and vice versa (Fig. 2B, Mut-B). Whereas the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA binding was reduced for both constructs, the ratio of 9.2 seen for Mut-A indicated that the differences in the CRD domains of RHL-1 and MHL-1 (amino acids 152–284) account for the greater ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA binding by RHL-1. The amino acid sequences of the CRD domains of RHL-1 and MHL-1 differ at 12 positions. We have divided these positions into three groups as shown in Fig. 2A. Mutagenesis was used to systematically convert amino acids at these positions in MHL-1V5His to those present in RHL-1. Mut-E (Fig. 2), which introduced the C-terminal most three amino acid differences (Group III) of RHL-1 into MHL-1, bound equal amounts of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and GGnM-BSA (a ratio of 1.0) similar to MHL-1. Mutating the Group II amino acids, Gln233, Glu238, Asn242 of MHL-1 to Lys233, Gly238, and Asp242 (Mut-F), resulted in an HL-1 subunit that bound more Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA than GGnM-BSA (a ratio of 11.9), effectively converting the specificity of MHL-1 to that of RHL-1. Other differences in the amino acid sequence of RHL-1 and MHL-1 also contribute to the specificity of RHL-1 for Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA. For example, the introduction of Arg198, Val200, and Gln202 of Group I of the rat in place of Asn198, Leu200, and Arg202 in MHL-1 reduced the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA binding from 11.9 (Mut-F) to 3.6 for Mut-G. The additional introduction of Trp194 and Glu195 also in Group I in place of Arg194 and Asp195 (Mut-H) increased the Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA:GGnM-BSA binding ratio to 5.9, still significantly less than that seen for either RHL-1 or Mut-F. Whereas the replacement of Arg172 with Lys172 in Mut-J did not markedly enhance the binding of either Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA or GGnM-BSA, the introduction of Lys172 in combination with the Group II sequence (Lys233, Gly238, and Asp242) enhanced the binding of both Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and GGnM-BSA (Mut-K). As a result, the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA was reduced even though both ligands were bound more avidly. As was seen for Mut-G, the replacement of Asn198, Leu200, and Arg202 of Group I with Arg198, Val200, and Gln202 reduced the binding of both Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and GGnM-BSA (Mut-L) as well as the Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA ratio. The introduction of Glu at position 238 in RHL-1 (Mut-M) did not reduce the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA to that of MHL-1, nor did the introduction of a Gly at position 238 in MHL-1 increase the ratio to that of RHL-1. Thus, a single change within the Group II residues that are in closest proximity to the probable contact residues of HL-1 is not sufficient to account for the difference in specificity seen in RHL-1 and MHL-1. Rat and Mouse HL-1 CRDs Expressed in Bacteria Retain Their Specificity for Terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc—Rat and mouse HL-1 CRDs consisting of residues 152–284 and a V5His sequence at the C terminus were expressed in bacteria and isolated by affinity chromatography on GalNAcβ-agarose columns. The affinity-purified products were homogeneous when examined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) and were active as demonstrated by their ability to bind GGnM-[125I]BSA in the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay (Fig. 3). The bacterially expressed and affinity-purified rat and mouse HL-1 CRDs retain their ability to bind Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA (Fig. 3); however, the rat HL-1 CRD (R1-CRDV5His) binds 3–5-fold more Siaα2,6GGnM-[125I]BSA per picomole of CRD than the mouse HL-1 CRD (M1-CRDV5His). The difference in ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-[125I]BSA to GGnM-[125I]BSA seen with the bacterially expressed HL-1 CRDs and those expressed in HEK-293T cells may reflect a number of possibilities related to the absence of cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. We previously reported that the HL-1 subunit of the rat ASGP-R binds terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc and can account for the rapid clearance of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA from the blood following injection (11Park E.I. Manzella S.M. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4597-4602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The studies we have presented here indicate that orthologues of the ASGP-R display marked differences in their specificity for terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc. For example, recombinant HL-1 subunits of the rat and mouse ASGP-R differ by 16-fold in their capacity to bind terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc compared with terminal GalNAc. This is the case, even though 87% of the amino acids in rat and mouse HL-1 is identical. The differential capacity for binding terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc displayed by extracts prepared from rat, rabbit, mouse, bovine, and porcine liver (Fig. 1) suggests that orthologues of the ASGP-R do not have identical specificities. The 16-fold difference in the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA: GGnM-BSA binding exhibited by RHL-1 and MHL-1 is of particular interest, because the subunits differ at only 12 positions within the CRD (residues 152–284). An exchange of the cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions of rat and mouse HL-1 confirmed that differences within the CRD account for the respective specificities of the rat and mouse ASGP-R for Siaα2,6GalNAc. Our systematic mutation of the MHL-1 to convert the amino acids at these 12 positions to those of the rat revealed that multiple changes in the sequence of the CRD contribute to the difference in specificity. The introduction of the Group II residues (Figs. 2A and 4, red-colored residues) produces a receptor that has the specificity of RHL-1 (Fig. 2B, Mut-F). Modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the HHL-1 CRD suggest that bound GalNAc would be stacked against Trp243 (colored white in Fig. 4) and that the three and four hydroxyls of the GalNAc would be coordinated by the Ca2+ at site 2 (colored green in Fig. 4) (8Meier M. Bider M.D. Malashkevich V.N. Spiess M. Burkhard P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The side chain of either a Gly or Glu at position 238 would be located adjacent to the side chain of Gln239 that is proposed to coordinate the C4 hydroxyl of the GalNAc (22Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6686-6693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, substitution of Gly238 in RHL-1 with Glu reduces but does not completely abolish Siaα2,6GalNAc binding (a ratio of 6.7) and the substitution of Glu238 in MHL-1 with Gly increases the level of Siaα2,6GalNAc binding (a ratio of 2.5) but not to the level seen for RHL-1. The presence of a Gly at position 238 is not sufficient to increase Siaα2,6GalNAc binding by MHL-1 to that seen for RHL-1. Asp242, which coordinates the Ca2+ (colored blue in Fig. 4) at site 1 of HL-1, may have an impact on interaction of the sialic acid with the peptide. Alterations in the sequence that are distant from the proposed GalNAc binding site also have an impact on binding Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA. For example, the Group I residues (Fig. 2A) that are located on the surface of the α2 helix (blue and yellow residues in Fig. 4) have an impact on binding Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA. Introduction of three of the five Group I residues at positions 198, 200, and 202 (residues colored blue in Fig. 4) in the presence of the Group II residues reduced the ratio of Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA to GGnM-BSA binding from 11.9 to 3.6 (Mut-F versus Mut-G). The additional introduction of the remaining two residues at positions 194 and 195 (residues colored yellow in Fig. 4) increased the ratio to 5.9 for Mut-H. Thus, the multiple residues that are present in Group I and form the α2 helix must be introduced together to preserve Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA binding in the presence of the Group II residues. It is notable that, with the exception of Lys172 (colored aqua in Fig. 4) that enhances the binding of both Siaα2,6GGnM-BSA and GGnM-BSA, all of the differences in the sequence of RHL-1 and MHL-1 that are visible in the crystal structure are located on the surface of HL-1 that contains the α2 helix. In addition, Lys233 from Group II and His262 from Group III are also on the surface of HL-1 in close proximity to the Group I residues in the α2 helix (Fig. 4). We have not determined how or whether the introduction of Group I residues alone would influence the binding of oligosaccharides. Because the Group I residues are distant from the binding site itself, it is not clear whether they alter interactions with contact residues in the binding site and/or whether they influence the formation of ASGP-R oligomers that are known to exist in vivo. The precise manner in which the HL-1 subunit oligomerizes with itself and HL-2 could have a significant impact on binding terminal Siaα2,6GalNAc. It is striking that multiple changes in the sequence of RHL-1 contribute to the increased avidity of RHL-1 for Sia2,6αGalNAc compared with MHL-1. Thus, it appears that few of the changes in the sequence of RHL-1 and MHL-1 can be viewed as silent alterations with respect to the ligand specificity of the ASGP-R. The different specificities of RHL-1 and MHL-1 may reflect exogenous and/or endogenous selection pressures. For example, the rat produces large amounts of prolactin-like glycoprotein hormones, prolactin-like hormones, that bear N-linked oligosaccharides terminating with Sia2,6αGalNAcβ1,4GlcNAcβ1, 2Manα in the placenta and releases them into the blood (11Park E.I.

Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4775-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have not detected either the protein-specific GalNAc-transferase or glycoproteins bearing terminal Sia2,6αGalNAcβ1, 4GlcNAcβ1,2Manα in the placentas of mice. The difference in the specificity of the rat versus mouse ASGP-R may reflect a requirement to recognize terminal Sia2,6αGalNAc during pregnancy in the rat. Alternatively, other selection pressures such as infectious or parasitic agents may account for changes in the specificity of the ASGP-R. Our results indicate that orthologues of the ASGP-R in different mammals cannot be assumed to display identical specificities for carbohydrate moieties terminating with β1,4-linked Gal or GalNAc (23Spiess M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10009-10018Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) despite the high percentage of identical amino acids in their sequences. Furthermore, glycoproteins bearing terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid rather than terminal Gal or GalNAc may prove to be endogenous ligands for the ASGP-R. The multiple amino acid sequence modifications required to account for the altered specificity of the ASGP-R in such evolutionarily closely related mammals may indicate that we are observing a carbohydrate-specific receptor, modulating its specificity to accommodate a need to recognize endogenous or exogenous oligosaccharide structures. Understanding the relationship between the specificity of the ASGP-R and the carbohydrates that are recognized may provide new insight into the role such receptors play in vivo."

Our previous photocross-linking results suggested that an element of the structural mechanism for the regulatory switch was a phosphorylation-induced motion of the regulatory light chain N terminus (Wahlstrom, J.

These phosphorylation-induced structural changes were not as evident in the absence of nucleotides. Nucleotide binding to unphosphorylated heavy meromyosin caused a decrease in exposure and an increase in polarity of the N terminus, whereas the effects of nucleotide on phosphorylated heavy meromyosin were the opposite. We showed a direct correlation between the kinetics of nucleotide binding/turnover and the conformational change reported by acrylodan at position 23 of the regulatory light chain.

A globular motor domain (N-terminal HC) and a light chain binding domain (HC + ELC + RLC) form a head (S1), and the two heads are dimerized by the HC C-terminal halves, which form a coiled-coil. The motor domain contains the catalytic site and the actin binding site (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Only the head domain and its subfragments have been crystallized to date so there are no atomic resolution structures of a doubleheaded construct. The actin-activated ATPase activity and motor properties of SMM and nonmuscle myosin are regulated by phosphorylation of Ser-19 of the RLC, which is greater than 10 nm from the catalytic site (1Sellers J.R.

Unfortunately, none of the crystal structures contain coordinates for the RLC N terminus (residues 1-24), presumably due to its lack of ordered secondary structure in single-head constructs.

The UP N terminus may stabilize the RLC-RLC or RLC-S2 interaction that allosterically down-regulates the ATPase activity. This model is consistent with a progressive increase in ATPase for UP-SMM as residues are sequentially deleted from the N terminus (21Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P.

Because our previous studies did not provide specific information about the phosphorylated state of HMM, we have turned to alternative approaches to further understand the role of the N terminus in the structural mechanism of the regulatory switch. In this study we used reactivity of cysteines, pyrene acrylamide quenching, and fluorescence spectral analysis of both pyrene and acrylodan to study conformational changes about the RLC affected by RLC phosphorylation and nucleotide binding. We focused on the interactions near position 23, where significant conformational differences between the UP-HMM and P-HMM states were found. These differences were most apparent when ADP or ATP was bound to the active site. Such differences were not found in the unregulated S1, thus directly implicating them in the regulatory structural mechanism. Using transient methods we showed that the RLC N-terminal conformational changes occurred at rates paralleling the nucleotide binding and Pi release. This is the first instance of a probe in the regulatory domain reporting nucleotide binding in the motor domain. The possible role of the observed conformational changes to the regulation mechanism of SMM is discussed. Reagents—Common reagents were purchased from Sigma or Fisher.

The mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature with pyrene iodoacetamide or ACR (2-4-fold over thiol concentration (measured with Ellman's reagent (28Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 88-90Google Scholar)), quenched with excess DTT, precipitated with 90% cold ethanol, and subsequently dialyzed to remove unconjugated fluorophore.

RLC Exchange and His Tag Removal—RLC was exchanged onto either HMM or S1 (22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Samples were precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (70% saturation) and dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, and the His tag was cleaved by thrombin treatment (22Wu X.

(Thio)Phosphorylation—HMM or S1 were thiophosphorylated as described (6Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Samples for thiol reactivity experiments were phosphorylated because the thiophosphate reacts with IAF (31Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. Bioconjugate Chem. 1992; 3: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because our preparations of HMM and S1 have residual phosphatase activity, phosphorylation was in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 30 μg/ml myosin light chain kinase, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaF, 4 μm microcystin, and 2 mm ATP on ice with slow stirring for 3 h. 1 mm EGTA was maintained in all solutions thereafter where phosphorylation was stable for days. All (thio)phosphorylations were confirmed by PAGE electrophoresis (23Wahlstrom J.L. Randall Jr., M.A. Lawson J.D. Lyons D.E. Siems W.F. Crouch G.J. Barr R. Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Steady-state Actin Activated MgATPase—An NADH-coupled assay (32De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to analyze the effect of IAF on HMM steady-state ATPase activity (Fig. 3) as follows: 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm NADH, 100 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 500 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 25 μm actin, and 0.6 or 0.1 mg/ml of UP- or P-HMM, respectively. The reaction (25 °C) was started by adding MgATP. Reactions lacking HMM were used for background subtraction. Reactivity of RLC Thiols—The conditions of the thiol reactivity experiments were similar to those used previously (33Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G.

UP- or PHMM/S1 (0.75-2.5 mg/ml; 100-200 μl) in reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm DTT with/without ATP or ADP) was incubated at 25 °C with 300 μm IAF. Aliquots (13 μg) were quenched at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 min by adding 10 μl of reducing gel sample buffer (2×, 0.5 m DTT). To measure reaction stoichiometry, IAF was raised to 600 μm at 3 min, and an aliquot was collected at 4 min. Samples were analyzed on Bis-Tris PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Excess IAF was removed, and proteins were fixed by rocking gels overnight in 300 ml of 50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid. Gels were washed twice in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) for 30 min before fluorescence imaging with a Vis-Blue plate (≈480 nm), 500-630-nm band-pass filter, and a transilluminator (UVP gel-documenting system, Upland, CA) (Fig. 2A). Imaged gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (36Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996Crossref Google Scholar), destained, and further imaged with white light and no filters (Fig. 2B). The normalized fluorescence of the RLC bands was calculated by dividing the fluorescence by the Coomassie densities (LabWorks software, UVP) to correct for variable protein loading. Because [IAF] >> [accessible protein-SH], the rate constants for the reaction (k, min-1) were calculated by fitting to Equation 1 for a first order reaction (37Espenson J.H. Chemical Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), [P]t=b+[A]o[1−exp(−kt)](Eq. 1) where Pt = labeled RLC at time t, b = the y intercept, and [A]o = total available RLC-Cys (amplitude). Actin-activated ATPase by Single Turnover of FTP—All single turnovers (6Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were performed in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 200 μm ATP, and 5 μm actin at 25 °C using a Hi-Tech SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a 75-watt mercury-xenon lamp with an excitation wavelength of 313 nm (bandwidth = 4 nm) and a 365-435-nm emission band-pass filter (P70-400, ThermoCorion). Regulated preparations showed a monophasic turnover rate of 0.0008-0.002 s-1 at 5 μm actin. Unregulated preparations (apparently due to exposure to an unknown component in some lots of diisopropyl fluorophosphate) showed a fast phase of variable rate and amplitude in addition to the regulated rate and were not used. The rate constants (k) and corresponding amplitudes (ΔF) were calculated as described (38Ellison P.A. DePew Z.S. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4410-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Binding Kinetics—Experiments were performed with the same instrument and buffer as the single turnovers except actin was not present, and ATP or ADP was added as indicated. To measure FTP binding kinetics, 2 μm FTP was mixed with 2 μm A23C/RLC HMM heads, and formycin fluorescence was monitored. For ACR fluorescence, 2 μm A23C/RLC HMM (heads) was mixed with either FTP, ATP, or ADP with excitation at 404 nm (bandwidth 4 nm) and an emission long-pass filter of >455 nm (GG455, Schott Glass). Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). We were interested in detecting structural differences that correlate to differences in regulatory properties of UP- and P-HMM. Our approach was to prepare a series of HMM-bound or S1-bound single-Cys RLC mutants and use these in a variety of chemical and spectral experiments designed to detect conformational changes. S1 is not regulated by phosphorylation and, therefore, serves as a negative control for structural changes not related directly to regulation. Large conformational changes occur in myosin during the nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, so all measurements were both in the absence (NON) and presence of the nucleotides MgATP or MgADP. Thus, measurements were made under six different states, three UP states, UP-NON, UP-ATP, UP-ADP, and three phosphorylated states, P-NON, P-ATP, P-ADP for HMM and S1. Fig. 1A shows our homology model of the regulatory domain (23Wahlstrom J.L. Randall Jr., M.A. Lawson J.D. Lyons D.E. Siems W.F. Crouch G.J. Barr R. Facemyer K.C. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Surface polar uncharged positions were chosen based on our previous work (22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

S59C was unable to form cross-links (22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol.

Actin-activated ATPase Measurements—Our methodology required exchange of mutant RLC, one at a time, for native RLC in HMM and S1. We used a thoroughly tested RLC exchange procedure shown to yield fully regulated HMM (6Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Wu X. Clack B.A. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All HMM preparations contained equimolar amounts of HC, ELC, and RLC as measured by gel densitometry (data not shown). To quantify regulation, we measured actin-activated ATPase activities by single-turnover of FTP (Table I), which unlike the steady-state method, can detect small amounts of unregulated protein (6Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The turnover rate for freshly prepared UP-HMM was monophasic (0.0014 s-1; Table I) and showed an increase in activity upon phosphorylation (∼175×, at 5 μm actin), consistent with our previous work (6Ellison P.A. Sellers J.R. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15142-15151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Ellison P.A. DePew Z.S. Cremo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4410-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The turnover for aged UP-HMM was biphasic, with a first phase ∼10× faster than a second phase of normal rate. The weighted average rate was ∼7× that of the control. The turnover rates of the mutants (similar in age to the aged unmodified) ranged between the aged and freshly prepared unmodified HMM. Therefore, we concluded that the slightly altered rates were due to the age of the protein, not to the mutation/thiol modification.Table ISummary of actin-activated ATPase measurements by single turnover of FTPHMMUnphosphorylatedPhosphorylatedkΔFkΔFs−1%s−1%Native (fresh)aUnmodified native HMM analyzed immediately after preparation or stored 1-3 days at 0 °C.Phase10.00141000.3178Phase20.03522Wt.

Open table in a new tab Turnovers for pyrene-labeled HMM could not be measured because pyrene interfered with the FTP signal. To approximate the turnover kinetics of HMM that was fully labeled with a bulky group similar to pyrene, we analyzed TMR-A23C HMM (100% exchanged; Table I), which showed a turnover rate 23× that of the control, demonstrating the maximal effect expected from a large probe. However, exchange efficiencies for all pyrene- or ACR-labeled preparations were ∼50%, so less than this maximal effect can be predicted for pyrene-labeled HMM. Under these conditions the ACR-A23C data were similar to the A23C data, suggesting that ACR is not large enough to significantly alter regulation. All of the P-HMMs (Table I) showed similar biphasic turnover rates and amplitudes to the unmodified native P-HMM. Q15C and S59C have been previously shown to be fully regulated (22Wu X.

T83C HMM could not be measured due to low RLC exchange efficiency. In summary, all UP mutants showed slightly elevated and P mutants showed normal ATPase activity, consistent with essentially normal regulation.

Here, we purified a 120-kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) substrate protein from porcine brains and identified the protein as amphiphysin1. Serine phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 was rapidly induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 cells, and the induction was blocked by a MAPK inhibitor. Furthermore, when phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro or by NGF treatment in vivo, amphiphysin1 failed to bind to AP-2, but its association with dynamin1 was unaffected. Consistent with this, mutation of consensus MAPK phosphorylation sites increased amphiphysin1 binding to AP-2 and their intracellular colocalization. Thus, we propose that MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 controls NGF receptor/TrkA-mediated endocytosis by terminating the amphiphysin1-AP-2 interaction. This perhaps helps to regulate the availability of amphiphysin1-dynamin1 complexes for binding to the endocytic vesicle.

This perhaps helps to regulate the availability of amphiphysin1-dynamin1 complexes for binding to the endocytic vesicle. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which involves the orchestration of several molecular components, is crucial for various intracellular communications including the control of the levels of transmembrane receptors and their ligands, the recycling of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals, and signal transduction (1Marsh M. McMahon H.T. Science. 1999; 285 (H. T.): 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Among endocytic proteins, amphiphysin1 has recently been postulated to perform an essential function in endocytosis (2Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Amphiphysin1 interacts with dynamin1 through its SH3 (Src-homology 3) domain (3Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and thereby recruits dynamin1 to the site of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (4Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. Camilli P.D. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) by binding to the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (α-adaptin subunit), which is associated with plasma membrane receptors. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events play an important role in the regulation of the assembly of endocytic protein complexes; phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 negatively regulates its association with AP-2, and phosphorylation of dynamin1 results in its dissociation from amphiphysin1 (5Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These modifications may contribute to the availability of amphiphysin1 and dynamin1 for binding to the coated vesicle. Recently, cylin-dependent kinase Cdk5 was identified as a protein kinase responsible for this phosphorylation reaction (6Floyd S.R. Porro E.B. Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Tsai L.H. Camilli P.D. J. Biol.

Cdk5 phosphorylated amphiphysin1 and thereby promoted the dissociation of amphiphysin1 from AP-2. Likewise, Cdk5-phosphorylation of dynamin1 inhibited its binding to amphiphysin1. The results indicate that Cdk5 plays an important physiological role in endocytosis at nerve terminals by altering protein-protein interaction. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of endocytosis through phosphorylation reaction has not fully been elucidated. The 42/45-kDa MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; wt, wild type; NGF, nerve growth factor; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; PRD, proline-rich domain. is activated by extracellular signals. Activation of MAPK requires its dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues catalyzed by MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPKK is activated by phosphorylation by Raf-1 (9Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). These kinases constitute a so-called MAPK cascade pathway, which controls cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and early embryonic development. In the current search for protein substrates for MAPK, we found that amphiphysin1 but not dynamin1 was phosphorylated by MAPK in response to NGF stimulation of PC12 cells. MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 negatively regulated the association of amphiphysin1 with AP-2 adaptor both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we speculate that MAPK controls NGF receptor-mediated endocytosis by terminating the interaction between amphiphysin1 and AP-2. Cell Fractionation and Phosphorylation Reaction—One rat brain was homogenized in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 3 mm imidazol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The particulate fraction was isolated by a low and high speed centrifugation (10Suzukawa K. Miura K. Mitsushita J. Resau J. Hirose K. Crystal R. Kamata T. J. Biol.

Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies (Sigma) or mouse monoclonal anti-amphiphysin1 antibodies (N8-2) (12Jin Y. Kim K.Y. Soung N.K. Shin E.Y. Kim E.G. Kim S.R. Exp. Mol.

Protein Purification—Four porcine brains were homogenized in homogenization buffer by a Dounce homogenizer, the particulate fractions were extracted in 200 ml of buffer A, and the extract was clarified by centrifugation as described previously (11Miura K. Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Mitsushita J. Kamijo K. Ishida H. Miki T. Suzukawa K. Resau J. Copeland T.D. Kamata T. J. Biol.

The peak fraction containing p120 eluted at 0.25 m NaCl was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, 20 ml) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.9). Proteins (2 ml/fraction) were eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0.05–0.6 m), and the peak fractions eluted at 0.3 m KCl were concentrated and loaded onto an FPLC MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0) (13Otsuka A.

Elution (0.5 ml/fraction) was performed with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) at 0.5 ml/min. A major peak was eluted at 0.35 m NaCl, and purified p120 proteins were processed for microsequencing (11Miura K. Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Mitsushita J. Kamijo K. Ishida H. Miki T. Suzukawa K. Resau J.

Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Amphiphysin1 proteins phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo were eluted from gel pieces and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 105 °C for 2 h followed by high voltage electrophoresis as described previously (14Adachi Y.

The phosphorylated amino acids were detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—PC12 cells were lysed in either a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5) or radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the lysates were immunoblotted or immunoprecipitated with various antibodies as indicated. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-wt-amphiphysin1 or GST (5 μg) bound to glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) were phosphorylated by activated GST-MAPK in the presence of 50 μm ATP as described in the legend for Fig. 1. The resins were incubated with PC12 cell lysates proteins (40 μg) for 90 min. AP-2 and dynamin1 bound to the resins were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against these proteins. Mutational Analysis—To create the amphiphysin1 mutants amph-285 and amph-293, Ser-285 and Ser-293, respectively, were converted to alanine by PCR mutagenesis, and the resulting DNAs were cloned into pEGFPC1. All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. 48 h after transfection of the wild type and mutant amphiphysin1 constructs (5 μg) into PC12 cells (1×106/6 cm dish) with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), cells were labeled with 32P-orthophosphate in phosphate-free medium and stimulated with NGF prior to phosphorylation analysis as described above. Alternatively, transfected cells were stimulated with or without NGF and subjected to immunostaining. Immunocytochemistry—Cells on coverslips were fixed in methanol at -20 °C for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Immunostaining was performed with the indicated antibodies as described previously (11Miura K. Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Mitsushita J. Kamijo K. Ishida H. Miki T. Suzukawa K. Resau J. Copeland T.D.

Identification and Purification of p120 Phosphorylated by MAPK—To identify the potential cellular target proteins for MAPK in neuronal cells, we first examined which proteins in rat brain particulate fractions were phosphorylated by MAPK in vitro. Extracts prepared from particulate fractions were subjected to phosphorylation reaction in the presence or absence of GST-MAPK that had been preactivated by GST-MAPKK. The data indicated that several proteins were preferentially phosphorylated in response to MAPK activation (Fig. 1A). We identified one of these with a molecular mass of 120 kDa (p120) as amphiphysin1 by three-step column chromatography. Fig. 1 (B and C) shows the elution profile from an FPLC MonoQ at the final step, and peak fractions contained partially purified p120 proteins. The doublet structure may be due to the protein degradation or posttranslational modification. Microsequencing revealed that amino acid sequences of two peptides prepared from p120 were identical to residues 142–158 and 671–681 of human amphiphysin1 (Fig. 1D), a component of endocytic machinery (15Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, anti-amphphysin1 antibodies recognized purified p120 in immunoblotting (data not shown). Amphyiphysin1 Is Phosphorylated by NGF-regulated MAPK— To confirm whether amphiphysin1 is a substrate for MAPK, GST-amphiphysin1 fusion proteins were created and incubated with GST-MAPK and [γ-32P]ATP. As predicted, amphiphysin1 was phosphorylated by MAPK following its activation by MAPKK (Fig. 2A). Immunoprecipitation studies with 32Porthophosphate-labeled PC12 cells showed that NGF treatment rapidly induced amphiphysin1 phosphorylation, as manifested in a slower mobility. A MAPKK inhibitor, PD98059, blocked this NGF action, indicating that MAPK mediates NGF-induced amphiphysin1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, time course experiments showed sustained phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 by NGF treatment (Fig. 2B), which correlated well with the NGF-induced duration of MAPK activation (16Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). Induction of amphiphysin1 phosphorylation was similarly detected in NGF-stimulated primary neuronal cells isolated from rat embryos (E18) (Fig. 2A). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 occurred primarily on serine residues both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2C). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of amphiphysin1 showed similar phosphopeptide distribution between MAPK-dependent phosphorylation in vitro and NGF-dependent phosphorylation in vivo (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that amphiphysin1 is a physiological substrate for NGF-regulated MAPK. MAPK Phosphorylation of Amphiphysin1 Blocks Its Association with AP-2—We next tested whether MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 influences its interaction with AP-2 and dynamin1. PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF for 10 min, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Fig. 3A shows that amphiphysin1 was phosphorylated upon NGF stimulation, exhibiting a slower migration in gel electrophoresis; this phosphorylation was blocked by PD98059 treatment. In parallel, co-precipitation of amphiphysin1 and AP-2 was markedly inhibited following NGF treatment, whereas amphiphysin1 tightly bound to AP-2 in untreated cells. PD98059 treatment prevented NGF-induced dissociation of amphiphysin1 from AP-2. In contrast, neither NGF treatment nor a MAPKK inhibitor had significant effects on amphiphysin1 binding to dynamin1 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, GST-amphiphysin1-immobilized resins were prepared, phosphorylated by activated MAPK, and incubated with lysates from PC12 cells. The amount of AP-2 retained to the phosphorylated amphiphysin1 resins was markedly reduced compared with that retained to unphosphorylated ones (Fig. 3B). Again, MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 had no inhibitory effect on dynamin1 association (Fig. 3B). Since amphiphysin1 contained Ser-285 and Ser-293 as potential sites (PXSP) of MAPK phosphorylation (17Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ser-285 and Ser-293 were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to examine the effect of phosphorylation on amphiphysin1 binding to AP-2. Although GFP-wt-amphiphysin1 was phosphorylated in response to NGF, the mutations lowered the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). On the contrary, the ability of the amphiphysin1 mutants to bind AP-2 was increased as compared with that in the wild type proteins (Fig. 3D), which is in agreement with the observation that inhibition of the MAPK activity enhances the amphiphysin1-AP-2 complex formation (Fig. 3A). MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 was not completely inhibited by the mutations, which may reflect the presence of other phosphorylation sites for MAPK or a contribution from a kinase other than MAPK. We performed phosphorylation of wt amphiphysin1 and its mutated counterparts by activated MAPK in vitro. The data indicate that the phosphorylation level of Ser-285 and Ser-293 mutants decreased by 60–70% compared with that of wt amphiphysin1, but the phosphorylation of the mutants was not completely abolished (Fig. 3E). Thus, the incomplete inhibition of NGF-induced amphiphysin1 phosphorylation by the mutations could be attributed to the existence of an additional phosphorylation site(s). However, since we cannot rule out the possibility that this additional phosphorylation is due to the nonphysiological, nonspecific phosphorylation of amphihysin1 by MAPK that occurs in vitro, it is still possible that a kinase(s) other than MAPK also contributes to the NGF-dependent phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 in vivo. Further analysis of the exact phosphorylation sites of amphiphysin1 will be necessary to reach a conclusion about this issue. MAPK Phosphorylation of Amphiphysin1 Affects Colocalization of Amphiphysin1 and AP-2 in Vivo—To further assess and complement these results, we next examined the subcellular localization of amphiphysin1 and AP-2 in PC12 cells by immunostaining. A large fraction of both proteins colocalized in the cytoplasmic region in unstimulated cells (Fig. 4A, a–c). However, NGF treatment of cells resulted in an increased segregation of amphiphysin1 from AP-2 (Fig. 4A, d–f). When cells were pretreated with PD98059, this NGF action was blocked, and a colocalization of amphiphysin1 with AP-2 was restored (Fig. 4A, j–l). Two proteins remained colocalized in PD98059-treated cells (Fig. 4A, g–i). Consistent with these results, the increased colocalization of the GFP-amphiphysin1 mutants at Ser-285 or Ser-293 with AP-2 was observed in the mutant-transfected PC12 cells even in the presence of NGF (Fig. 4B, d–i). Conversely, expression of GFP-wt-amphiphysin1 resulted in its dissociation from AP-2 in NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4B, a–c). These results are consistent with the biochemical study of the physical interaction between two proteins (Fig. 3) as well as the previous observation that dephosphorylation of rat brain extracts promotes the assembly of amphiphysin1 with AP-2, whereas phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 inhibits its binding to AP-2 (5Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Effects of MAPK Phosphorylation of Amphiphysin1 on Endocytosis—We next examined whether phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 by MAPK affects NGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF for 20 min in the presence or absence of PD98059 and subjected to immunostaining with antibodies to TrkA and EEA1 (a marker for early endosomes). Although NGF treatment of cells triggered internalization of TrkA and caused a moderate increase in colocalization of TrkA into EEA1-positive endosomes (Fig. 5, d–f), the addition of PD98059 significantly enhanced this colocalization (Fig. 5, g–i). Increased TrkA internalization was also detected in cells transfected with GFP-amphiphysin1 mutants at Ser-285 and Ser-293 as compared with cells transfected with wt amphiphysin1 (data not shown). The finding suggests that inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 results in accelerated internalization of TrkA into endosomes, perhaps because of the increased formation of amphiphysin1-AP-2 complexes. In another word, MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 seems to have a suppressive effect on endocytosis of the NGF receptor. In this study, we provide evidence for a functional link between amphiphysin1 and the MAPK signaling pathway. We have demonstrated phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 by MAPK in vitro and NGF-stimulated MAPK in vivo. We have also shown that although MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 disassembled amphiphysin1-AP-2 complexes during NGF stimulation of PC12 cells, a MAPK inhibition rescued the association of AP-2 with amphiphysin1. Thus, our findings point to an important possibility that MAPK negatively regulates the interaction between amphiphysin1 and AP-2 during progression of endocytosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report that one of the cellular targets for MAPK is integrated into NGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of amphiphysin 1 at Ser-285 and/or Ser-293 affects the function of amphiphysin1. Since these serine residues are contained in the proline-rich domain (PRD) of amphiphysin1 and the PRD of unphosphorylated amphiphysin1 binds to AP-2 (5Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. Camilli P.D. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), MAPK phosphorylation of Ser-285 and Ser-293 could modulate the interaction between PRD and AP-2, resulting in the dissociation of amphiphysin1 from AP-2. Recent studies show that phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 PRD by Cdk5 inhibited the association of amphiphysin1 with AP-2 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (7Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat.

Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) similar to that by MAPK (present report). Cdk5 appears to phosphorylate amphiphysin1 at serines 261, 272, 276, and 285 and threonine 310, located in the PRD (6Floyd S.R. Porro E.B. Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Tsai L.H. Camilli P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8104-8110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that MAPK and Cdk5 target the overlapping phosphorylation sites (Ser-285) leading to a similar regulatory effect on amphiphysin1. Furthermore, the mutation of Ser-285 and Ser-293 to alanine did not completely abolish the phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 in vivo, which implies the involvement of another kinase or the existence of additional phosphorylation sites for MAPK (Fig. 3C). Although the incomplete inhibition in MAPK phosphorylation of the amphiphysin1 mutants in vitro suggests the latter possibility, it is still possible that another kinase also participates in NGF-dependent amphiphysin1 phosphorylation. Therefore, we do not rule out the possibility that Cdk5, as well as MAPK, is involved in phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 in NGF receptor-mediated endocytosis. Another feature of MAPK-dependent phosphorylation is that whereas Cdk5, in addition to phosphorylation of amphiphysin1, phosphorylated dynamin1 and thereby blocked its binding to amphiphysin1 (8Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), MAPK was unable to phosphorylate dynamin1 and had no inhibitory effect on the formation of amphiphysin1-dynamin1 complexes (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the two kinases exert distinct regulatory roles in some aspects of endocytosis. Endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits has been regarded as a mechanism to switch off and renew plasma membrane receptor signaling (18Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P. Cell. 2001; 106: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this scheme, the supply and availability of dynamin1 and accessory proteins of clathrin-coated vesicles would be a critical limiting factor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We therefore propose the following model for the role of MAPK phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 (Fig. 6). In NGF-stimulated PC12 cells, the ligand stimulation of the NGF receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA transmits activation signals through the Ras-Raf-MAPKK-MAPK pathway to the nucleus, resulting in neurite outgrowth. Simultaneously, the activated MAPK also phosphorylates amphiphysin1 following internalization of the NGF receptor, and this phosphorylation event contributes to disassembly of endocytic coat proteins by terminating the interaction of amphiphysin1 with AP-2, which would lead to recycling of amphiphysin1-dynamin1 complexes. Possibly, MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of amphiphysin1 also affects internalization of the NGF receptor into endosomes by controlling amphiphysin1-AP-2 complexes, because MAPK inhibition caused the increased trafficking of TrkA into EEA1-positive endosomes (Fig. 5). Our discovery that MAPK is involved in the regulation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis is consistent with accumulating evidence that functional links exist between the machinery of receptor-mediated signaling and endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (18Di Fiore P.P.

This enzyme catalyzes the condensation between para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) and 5-phospho-α-d-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) with concomitant formation of β-RFA-P, CO2, and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (1White R.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3447-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a phosphoribosyltransferase and a decarboxylase and forms a C-riboside, which is unique among phosphoribosyltransferases and pABA-dependent enzymes. For example, in an early step in tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis, dihydropteroate synthase catalyzes a condensation between the amino group of pABA and dihydropterin pyrophosphate to generate dihydropteroate, eliminating PPi. Thus, β-RFA-P synthase and dihydropteroate synthase both use pABA as a substrate and produce PPi as product; however, the amino group is the nucleophile in dihydropteroate synthase, whereas the aromatic ring carbon 4 (C-4) is the nucleophile in β-RFA-P synthase (2Maden B.E.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 609-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). How does RFA-P synthase generate an electrophilic center at C-1 of PRPP? How does this enzyme poise ring carbon-4 of pABA for nucleophilic attack on the C-1 of PRPP and activate this position for decarboxylation? The mechanism shown in Scheme 1 is our working hypothesis. When PRPP binds, C-1 is converted into an electrophilic center. Many PRPP-dependent enzymes utilize an Sn1 mechanism involving elimination of PPi to form an oxocarbenium ion that undergoes nucleophilic attack. Deprotonation of the amine group of pABA would promote delocalization of electron density to form a quininoid species with development of negative charge at C-4. What would stabilize this negative charge on a carbon that already contains a negatively charged carboxyl group? It was suggested that β-RFA-P synthase contains PLP, which is known to stabilize similar intermediates during decarboxylation or deamination of amino acids, and the partially purified enzyme appeared to contain a chromophore with properties similar to those of PLP (3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we show here that β-RFA-P synthase lacks PLP and apparently any other cofactor that would be capable of stabilizing negative charge developing during the reaction. Thus, all the interesting chemistry performed in this reaction appears to be promoted by the enzyme per se. The study of β-RFA-P synthase is significant because it is an early step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT), which is a modified folate that is of central importance in growth and energy metabolism of methanogens. H4MPT is involved in multiple steps in methane formation as in one carbon reactions involved in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism. Even though H4MPT is found in Archaea and one class of Bacterium (e.g. Methylobacterium extorquens), the biosynthetic pathway for these two folates (folate and methanopterin) is different suggesting that they play different functional roles in physiology of the cell (4Scott J.W.

We are targeting this enzyme to inhibit specifically methanogenesis (6Dumitru R. Palencia H. Schroeder S.D. DeMontigny B.A. Takacs J.M. Rasche M.E. Miner J.L. Ragsdale S.W. Appl. Environ.

In this paper, we report the cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of the steady-state mechanism of β-RFA-P synthase from the hyperthermophilic methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii and show that it lacks cofactors. We propose a mechanism for this reaction based on product inhibition studies and a rationale for how pABA is activated to perform a nucleophilic attack on PRPP. The reaction is believed to proceed via an oxycarbenium intermediate formed from PRPP that forms an adduct with the C-4 of pABA (Scheme 1).

Enzymatic Synthesis and Purification of β-RFA-P—β-RFA-P was produced enzymatically by incubating the β-RFA-P synthase (1 μg of protein) with substrates for 3 h at 70 °C and isolated using a Shodex AXpak WA-624 (6 × 150 mm) high pressure liquid chromatography column developed first with a linear gradient from solution A to B for 30 min and then washed for 10 min with solution A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solution A contained 0.1 m ammonium formate, pH 3.0/acetonitrile (90:10), and solution B was composed of 0.5 m ammonium formate, pH 3.0/acetonitrile (80:20). The detector was set at 260 nm, and the chromatography was performed at room temperature (22 °C). β-RFA-P eluted at a retention time of 12.5 min, while the retention times for pABA and PRPP were 22 and 26 min, respectively. β-RFA-P was identified and quantified with the Bratton-Marshall assay (3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the control reaction lacking enzyme, no peak was observed at 12.5 min. The fractions containing β-RFA-P were collected and lyophilized, and the powder was stored at room temperature for further usage. To check the stability and purity of the β-RFA-P, the powder was dissolved in solution A and run by high pressure liquid chromatography, and only a single sharp peak was observed at 12.5 min. Cloning and Expression of the RFA-P Synthase Gene—A BLAST search revealed that the M. jannaschii β-RFA-P synthase was likely to be encoded by gene MJ1427 (4Scott J.W. Rasche M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4442-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We amplified this gene from M. jannaschii chromosomal DNA by the PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The commercially synthesized primers were 5′-CACCATGATAATTCAAACACCATCAAGGA-3′ and 5′-TCACCAAATTTTATGCCCCACATTATT-3′ for protein overexpressed with a His tag at the N terminus. The PCR product was separated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, and the appropriate band (1 kb in length) was extracted using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA.). The gene sequences were verified by the Genomics Core Research Facility at The University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For expression, the gene was cloned into pET200 (Invitrogen), a Champion™ pET directional TOPO expression plasmid, and transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells. For overexpression, the plasmid was introduced into E. coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS cells. The cells were grown in 1 liter of Luria-Bertani broth at 15 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min. The primers used to amplify MJ1427 without a His tag were 5′-CACCTGAAGAAGGAGAATACATATGATAATTCAAACACCATC-3′ and 5′-TCACCAAATTTTATGCCCCACATTATT-3′. The protocol used for cloning and overexpression was identical to the one employed for the gene with a tag at the N terminus. For the tag-less enzyme, the yield was lower (30%) than that for the His-tagged protein. For overexpression, E. coli Rosetta (DE3)pLysS strain was used because it provided a higher yield because of the presence of rare tRNAs required by MJ1427. The pure enzyme had a specific activity ranging from 200 to 250 nmol/min/mg protein. Purification of β-RFA-P Synthase—β-RFA-P synthase from M. jannaschii was purified to homogeneity by column chromatography and heat treatment. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was loaded on a Ni-NTA column, which was washed with a buffer solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, to remove proteins that are nonspecifically attached to the resin. The His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 150 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Fractions with active enzyme were further purified by heat treatment at 70 °C in a water bath for 15 min. The turbid solution was again centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C until needed. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and the protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. UV-visible spectra of purified β-RFA-P synthase (5 mg/ml in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2) were recorded using a Beckman DU 7400 spectrophotometer. Assay for PLP and Pyruvoyl Prosthetic Group—The protocol for removal of PLP from the enzyme involved treating the enzyme with 5 mm hydroxylamine for 24 and 72 h as described previously (7Taoka S. West M. Banerjee R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2738-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To assay for pyruvate, HCl was added to adjust the pH of the enzyme solution to ∼3.0. Then the solution was boiled for 1 h, and the pH was adjusted to pH 8.0, and lactate dehydrogenase and NADH were added to measure the amount of pyruvate formed by using the lactate dehydrogenase assay. The total volume of the assay was 1 ml in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and the reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm for 5 min (8Riley A.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1953; 8: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Assay for β-RFA-P Synthase and Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (9Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. β-RFA-P synthase activity was measured by following the release of 14CO2 from p-aminobenzoic acid with a radioactive label in the carboxyl group essentially as described earlier (6Dumitru R. Palencia H. Schroeder S.D. DeMontigny B.A. Takacs J.M. Rasche M.E. Miner J.L. Ragsdale S.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 7236-7241Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics of β-RFA-P Synthase—Stock solutions of pABA (2.93, 5.86, 14.6, 29.3, 58.66, or 88 mm), 25 mm PPi, 10 mm NaHCO3 were used. The CO2 concentration was estimated by the Henderson-Hasselbach equation taking into account the pH of the reaction mixture and the NaHCO3 concentration. The assays were performed at 70 °C for 3 h and were initiated by adding enzyme. In all the assays, the buffer was 100 mm TES, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 4.8. To determine the Michaelis parameters of β-RFA-P synthase for pABA, the reaction mixture contained PRPP (1, 2.5, 4, or 10 mm) and varying concentrations of pABA (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1–3mm) in 100 mm TES, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 4.8. To determine the Michaelis parameters of β-RFA-P synthase for PRPP, the reaction mixture contained pABA (0.1, 0.2, 1, and 3 mm) and varying concentrations of PRPP (0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 8 mm) in the same buffer as for pABA. Product Inhibition Studies—To determine the type of inhibition and the inhibition constants for CO2, PPi, and RFAP, the assays were performed at fixed concentrations for each product and variable concentrations of pABA under saturated and unsaturated conditions with respect to PRPP and varied PRPP concentrations under saturated and unsaturated concentrations for pABA. In one set of studies, RFAP (0.2 and 1 mm) was used under saturating pABA (3 mm) and varied PRPP (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 8 mm). In another set of studies, RFAP (0.1 and 0.25 mm) was used at subsaturating concentrations of pABA (0.1 mm) and varied PRPP. A third set of studies included saturating PRPP (8 mm) and varied pABA (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1–3mm) and RFAP (0.36, 0.9, and 1.8 mm). For CO2 and PPi the same concentrations of pABA and PRPP were used but at different concentrations of PPi (1 and 3 mm under saturated and unsaturated PRPP and saturated and unsaturated pABA, respectively), and for CO2 the following concentrations were used: 2, 4, and 6 mm for both saturated and unsaturated conditions for both substrates. Analysis of Kinetic Data—The Vmax, Km, and Ki values were determined by globally fitting the data to the nonlinear steady-state equations for bisubstrate sequential (Equation 1) and ping-pong (Equation 2) mechanisms. The data were analyzed using Sigma Plot 7.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). As described under “Results,” the fits to a sequential mechanism uniformly gave much lower standard errors than to a ping-pong mechanism. Product inhibition data were fit to the nonlinear equations for competitive, uncompetitive, and mixed modes of inhibition (10Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Wiley-Interscience, New York1975: 653-656Google Scholar). v/Vmax=[A]·[B]/(Kia·KmB+KmB·[A]+KmA·[B]+[A]·[B])(Eq. 1) v/Vmax=[A]·[B]/(KmB·[A]+KmA·[B]+[A]·[B])(Eq. 2) Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Experiments—For ITC measurements, β-RFA-P synthase was dialyzed against a buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl prior to analysis. All ITC measurements were carried out using a Microcal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal). A 30 μm solution of β-RFA-P synthase diluted in dialysis buffer was added to the sample cell (about 1.4 ml), and a 0.5–1 mm solution of PRPP and PPi titrant was loaded into the injection syringe. For each titration experiment, a 60-s delay at the start of the experiment was followed by 35 injections of 7.5 μl of the titrant solution, spaced apart by 240 s. The sample cell was stirred at 300 rpm throughout and maintained at a temperature of 35 °C. Control titrations were performed by titrating titrant solutions into dialysis buffer. Titration data were analyzed using the Origin 5.0 software supplied by Microcal. Data sets were corrected for base-line heats of dilutions from control runs as appropriate. The corrected data were then fit to a theoretical titration curve describing one binding site per titrant. The area under each peak of the resultant heat profile was integrated and plotted against the molar ratio of β-RFA-P synthase protein to titrant. A nonlinear best fit binding isotherm for the data was used to calculate the dissociation constant. Three-dimensional Modeling—The three-dimensional structural prediction for β-RFA-P synthase was generated by submitting the amino acid sequence to the three-dimensional-PSSM (threading) server located at www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dpssm/ (13Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). The best hit had an E value of 1.66e–08, and the threading had been done based on this hit. Most interestingly, β-RFA-P synthase shares 21% amino acid sequence identity and folding patterns to homoserine kinase (best hit) rather than known N-riboside phosphoribosyltransferases. The Bratton-Marshall assay (3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that was previously used to measure β-RFA-P synthase activity is quite cumbersome. Therefore, we have developed a rapid assay for the enzyme in which p-aminobenzoic acid with a radioactive label in the carboxyl group is reacted with PRPP. This assay facilitates purification and kinetic studies and could easily be adapted for rapid quench kinetic studies. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of β-RFA-P Synthase from M. jannaschii—By using the methods described under “Experimental Procedures,” we successfully cloned and overexpressed the β-RFA-P synthase from M. jannaschii (MJ1427) gene in E. coli. β-RFA-P synthase was purified to homogeneity by using a combination of column chromatography and heat treatment (Table I and Fig. 1). The specific activity for the enzyme in the cell extract of induced cells was 10.0 nmol of β-RFA-P produced per min/mg of protein, in agreement with the enzyme from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (4Scott J.W. Rasche M.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4442-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the protein was probed by using anti-His tag antibodies and antibodies raised against the pure protein, which stained a band around 37 kDa, indicating that this is the protein of interest.Table IPurification of recombinant β-RFA-P synthase from M. jannaschiiPurification stepTotal volumeEnzyme activityProtein concentrationTotal proteinSpecific activityTotal activityaβ-RFA-P synthase activity assays were measured at pH 4.8 for 3 h at 70 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Purification factorYieldmlmilliunits/mlmg/mlmgmilliunits/mgmilliunitsn%Cell extract50575.7183.0510.028501100Ni-NTA column10214.572.62682.532145.788.2575.29Heat treatment9198.660.87.2248.331787.9724.8362.73a β-RFA-P synthase activity assays were measured at pH 4.8 for 3 h at 70 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The cell extract was loaded onto an Ni-NTA column, which was washed with 10 column volumes of Wash buffer (see under “Experimental Procedures”). β-RFA-P synthase (26 mg with a specific activity of 82.5 nmol min–1 mg–1) was eluted with a solution (Elution buffer) containing 150 mm imidazole. The active fractions were further purified by heat treatment at 70 °C for 15 min, which precipitated most E. coli proteins and yielded a pure protein (10 mg of protein per 1 liter of culture medium) with a specific activity of 248 nmol min–1 mg–1. The β-RFA-P synthase gene also has been cloned with a His tag at the C terminus (using a pQE60 expression vector from Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and with no tag (using the same vector as for the gene cloned with a His tag at N terminus), and the specific activities of the pure proteins were indistinguishable, suggesting that the His tag has no influence in the activity of the enzyme. However, in both cases, the levels of protein were lower than that those observed with the gene cloned into the pET 200 expression vector with a tag at N terminus (data not shown). The recombinant enzyme from M. jannaschii has an optimum pH around 4.9, which is similar to the pH activity profiles of the enzymes from A. fulgidus and Methanosarcina thermophila (2Maden B.E.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 609-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 molecular exclusion column to be 70 kDa, indicating that the protein is a homodimer containing two 36.2-kDa monomers (data not shown). β-RFA-P Synthase Does Not Contain PLP or a Pyruvoyl Moiety as Cofactors to Perform Catalysis—The homogeneously purified and fully active enzyme was used to determine whether or not it contains any cofactors to perform catalysis. As described under the “Discussion,” it was proposed that β-RFA-P synthase might contain PLP (3Rasche M.E. White R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11343-11351Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is reasonable given the need to stabilize the build up of charge on the C-4 of pABA during the reaction. However, the UV-visible spectrum of the pure fully active M. jannaschii enzyme at concentration up to 50 μm showed no UV-visible or detectable peaks between 300 and 500 nm (Fig. 2), indicating the absence of PLP. If the enzyme sample shown in Fig. 2 contained PLP, there would be an absorption band at ∼350 nm with an absorbance of 0.2. The pure enzyme also lacks the characteristic fluorescence spectrum of PLP. Hydroxylamine is routinely used to liberate bound PLP as an oxime that should be separated from the protein by Centricon filtration. However, hydroxylamine treatment for up to 4 days at 4 °C does not result in any loss of activity, and incubation of enzyme with PLP does not affect activity (Table II).Table IICorrelation between PLP and β-RFA-P activityTreatmentaFollowing treatment with hydroxylamine, β-RFA-P synthase was dialyzed for 2 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Specific activitybThe assays were conducted in absence or presence of added PLP, and the specific activities represent the average of two experiments.nmol/min/mg proteinNone150 ± 10 (-PLP)160 ± 12 (+PLP)5 mm NH2OH, 4 °C, 24 h145 ± 15 (-PLP)156 ± 14 (+PLP)5 mm NH2OH, 4 °C, 72 h148 ± 12 (-PLP)161 ± 15 (+PLP)a Following treatment with hydroxylamine, β-RFA-P synthase was dialyzed for 2 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b The assays were conducted in absence or presence of added PLP, and the specific activities represent the average of two experiments. Open table in a new tab Because the data just described clearly indicate that PLP is not a cofactor for RFAP synthase, it is possible that another cofactor that does not exhibit an UV-visible spectrum is present (Fig. 2). Instead of PLP, several amino acid decarboxylases contain pyruvate as a covalently bound, catalytically active prosthetic group. However, unlike other pyruvoyl enzymes, β-RFA-P synthase does not require auto-processing; the size of the purified protein is consistent with that determined from the gene sequence. Furthermore, the direct lactate dehydrogenase assay for release of bound pyruvate did not indicate any conversion of NADH to NAD+. In Table III, the potential 30 μm covalently bound pyruvate that would have been liberated (because 30 μm of protein had been used) would have resulted in a change of absorbance at 340 nm because of oxidation of NADH to NAD of 0.19. However, the lack of any change in absorbance of the solution after adding the lactate dehydrogenase reaction mixture strongly indicates that β-RFA-P synthase does not contain a pyruvoyl cofactor. Apparently, this enzyme is free of cofactors and prosthetic groups, and the amino acids themselves provide all the catalytic groups that stabilize the oxycarbenium from PRPP and the development of negative charge at C-4 of pABA.Table IIILactate dehydrogenase assay to quantify the amount of pyruvate releaseAssay compositionAmount of pyruvate expectedAmount of pyruvate measured based on NADH reductionμm2 μl of lactate dehydrogenase300 μm NADH10098100 μm pyruvateNo lactate dehydrogenase300 μm NADH1002100 μm pyruvate2 μl of lactate dehydrogenase300 μm NADH301.530 μm protein2 μl of lactate dehydrogenaseNo NADH30030 μm protein2 μl of lactate dehydrogenaseNo NADH1000100 μm pyruvate Open table in a new tab Steady-state Kinetics for β-RFA-P Synthase—When the steady-state kinetic data were globally fit to both ordered sequential and ping-pong mechanisms, the initial velocity kinetic experiments clearly support the sequential ternary complex mechanism and are inconsistent with a ping-pong mechanism. The values for the maximal velocity and Michaelis constants for pABA and PRPP are as follows: KmpABA = 150 ± 10 μm, KmPRPP = 1600 ± 300 μm, and Vmax = 180 nmol min–1 mg–1 (kcat = 0.23 s–1) (Fig. 3 and Table IV). Fits to a ping-pong mechanism are clearly inferior, based on the statistics shown in Table IV. Given that there is active discussion about whether some PRPP enzymes utilize ping-pong or ternary complex mechanisms (12Craig S.P. Eakin A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20231-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we also used isotope exchange methods to further test the steady-state mechanism. In a ping-pong kinetic model, the first product is released before the second substrate binds, forming a modified enzyme intermediate. Such a mechanism would predict the ability of the enzyme to catalyze two independent exchange reactions at rates equal to or greater than the overall reaction rate, namely a PRPP-independent exchange reaction between [CO2] and the [14C]carboxyl group of pABA and a pABA-independent exchange reaction between [32P]PPi and PRPP. We were unable to observe any CO2/pABA exchange (see “Experimental Procedures”) when up to 250 μg of β-RFA-P synthase was incubated with 10 mm [CO2] and 3 mm [14C]pABA for 3 h. These results strongly support a ternary complex mechanism.Table IVResults of product inhibition studies as compared with patterns predicted for kinetic modelsVaried substrate (mm)Type of mechanismProduct inhibitorABUnsaturated with BSaturated with BUnsaturated with ASaturated with AOrderedPMTUCMTMTBi-TeraFrom Segel (10).QUCUCUCUCRCCMTPing-PongPMTCCBi-TeraFrom Segel (10).QUCUCMTMTRCCUCBased on experimentsPMTUCMTMTK1 = 1.23 ± 0.19Ki = 0.99 ± 0.18K1 = 1.49 ± 0.32K1 = 1.37 ± 0.33K2 = 4.02 ± 0.52Km = 1.4 ± 0.25K2 = 4.3 ± 0.6K2 = 3.8 ± 0.47Km = 1.45 ± 0.05Rsqr = 0.96Km = 0.17 ± 0.02Km = 0.17 ± 0.02Rsqr = 0.99Rsqr = 0.98Rsqr = 0.98QUCUCUCUCKi = 0.1 ± 0.07Ki = 0.21 ± 0.016Ki = 0.19 ± 0.02Ki = 0.345 ± 0.01Km = 1.5 ± 0.1Km = 1.5 ± 0.25Km = 0.19 ± 0.02Km = 0.168 ± 0.013Rsqr = 0.98Rsqr = 0.99Rsqr = 0.99Rsqr = 0.99RCCMTMTKi = 0.174 ± 0.04Ki = 0.324 ± 0.03K1 = 0.63 ± 0.02K1 = 1.1 ± 0.025Km = 1.65Km = 1.65K2 = 1.9 ± 0.3K2 = 5.4 ± 1Rsqr = 0.98Rsqr = 0.99Km = 0.17 ± 0.025Km = 0.15 ± 0.02Rsqr = 0.98Rsqr = 0.99a From Segel (10Segel I.H.

https://openalex.org/W2036007568,"The α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase FucT-VII is essential for the biosynthesis of selectin ligands, but the signaling pathways mediating FucT-VII induction in T cells and other lymphocytes are poorly understood. We have shown previously that sustained activation of Ras in Jurkat T cells induces FucT-VII transcription, which requires the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. In this study we report that FucT-VII induction is specific to the H-Ras isoform. Jurkat T cells retrovirally transduced with constitutively active H-Ras but not N- or K-Ras up-regulated expression of FucT-VII. Pharmacological inhibition studies also revealed that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity is required for H-Ras-mediated FucT-VII induction. However, the ability of H-Ras to selectively induce FucT-VII is not a function of the inability of the N- or K-Ras isoforms to activate Raf or PI3K pathways. The use of effector-loop domain mutants of H-Ras, which are impaired for their ability to interact selectively with individual effectors alone or in combination with active Raf, indicated that induction of FucT-VII requires the concomitant activation of at least three signaling pathways. These studies show that H-Ras mediates FucT-VII induction in Jurkat T cells via the activation of the Raf, PI3K, and a distinct, H-Ras-specific effector signaling pathway."
