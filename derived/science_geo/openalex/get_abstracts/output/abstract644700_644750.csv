https://openalex.org/W3102103775,"We report the observation of a quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted bilayer graphene showing Hall resistance quantized to within .1\% of the von Klitzing constant $h/e^2$ at zero magnetic field.The effect is driven by intrinsic strong correlations, which polarize the electron system into a single spin and valley resolved moir\'e miniband with Chern number $C=1$. In contrast to extrinsic, magnetically doped systems, the measured transport energy gap $\Delta/k_B\approx 27$~K is larger than the Curie temperature for magnetic ordering $T_C\approx 9$~K, and Hall quantization persists to temperatures of several Kelvin. Remarkably, we find that electrical currents as small as 1~nA can be used to controllably switch the magnetic order between states of opposite polarization, forming an electrically rewritable magnetic memory."

Wang et al. studied three such small molecules—theophylline, caffeine, and theobromine—that bear both carbonyl and amino groups. For theophylline, hydrogen bonding of the amino hydrogen to surface iodide optimized the carbonyl interaction with a lead antisite defect and improved the efficiency of a perovskite cell from 21 to 22.6%.

It can be released into the cytosol in response to stress and thus encounter cytosolic DNA sensors, triggering type I interferon responses. During apoptosis, mtDNA release is mediated by macropores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) created by oligomerization of the proteins BAX and BAK. Kim et al. found that during oxidative stress, mtDNA escapes instead through macropores formed by oligomerization of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) (see the Perspective by Crow). In a mouse model of lupus, an inhibitor of VDAC oligomerization diminished mtDNA release and downstream signaling events. This treatment reduced lupus-like symptoms in the model, suggesting a potential therapeutic route for conditions mediated by mtDNA release. Science , this issue p. 1531 ; see also p. 1445"

Kubota et al. now report that adding a piezoelectric catalyst to the mix can promote bond formation through apparent electron transfer cycles (see the Perspective by Xia and Wang). Specifically, barium titanate activates aryl diazonium salts toward borylation and coupling with heterocycles in a manner reminiscent of solutionphase photoredox catalysis. The reactions are insensitive to air and were demonstrated up to gram scale. Science , this issue p. 1500 ; see also p. 1451"

Jackson et al. examined nearly 2500 languages to determine the degree of similarity in linguistic networks of 24 emotion terms across cultures (see the Perspective by Majid). There were low levels of similarity, and thus high variability, in the meaning of emotion terms across cultures. Similarity of emotion terms could be predicted on the basis of the geographic proximity of the languages they originate from, their hedonic valence, and the physiological arousal they evoke.

However, the standard route requires large quantities of corrosive nitric acid. J. Yang et al. present an efficient alternative route whereby a palladium catalyst adds carbon monoxide to each end of butadiene (see the Perspective by Schaub). Both reactants are available at commodity scale, and the reaction produces no by-products.

https://openalex.org/W2996221411,"Spying on bacterial signals Many bacteria produce small molecules for monitoring population density and thus regulating their collective behavior, a process termed quorum sensing. Pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which complicates cystic fibrosis disease, produce different quorum-sensing ligands at different stages of infection. Moura-Alves et al. used experiments in human cells, zebrafish, and mice to show that a host organism can eavesdrop on these bacterial conversations. A host sensor responds differentially to bacterial quorum-sensing molecules to activate or repress different response pathways. The ability to “listen in” on bacterial signaling provides the host with the capacity to fine-tune physiologically costly immune responses. Science , this issue p. eaaw1629"

Dogra et al. studied such dynamics in a system consisting of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate located in an optical cavity and exposed to a standing wave of laser light. Light scattering off the atomic cloud and into the cavity resulted in two distinct, spatially patterned collective modes for the atoms. When the researchers then introduced dissipation to couple the two modes, the system followed a directed circular path through phase space, rotating between the modes. Science , this issue p. 1496"

Le Nours et al. identified a phenotypically diverse γδ T cell subset in human tissues that reacts to MHC-related protein 1 (MR1), which presents vitamin B derivatives. A crystal structure of a γδ TCR–MR1–antigen complex revealed that some of these TCRs can bind underneath the MR1 antigen-binding cleft instead of recognizing the presented antigen. This work thus uncovers an additional ligand for γδ T cells and reconceptualizes the nature of T cell antigen recognition. Science , this issue p. 1522"
https://openalex.org/W2995488106,"Deciding between stimuli requires combining their learned value with one’s sensory confidence. We trained mice in a visual task that probes this combination. Mouse choices reflected not only present confidence and past rewards but also past confidence. Their behavior conformed to a model that combines signal detection with reinforcement learning. In the model, the predicted value of the chosen option is the product of sensory confidence and learned value. We found precise correlates of this variable in the pre-outcome activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and of medial prefrontal cortical neurons. However, only the latter played a causal role: inactivating medial prefrontal cortex before outcome strengthened learning from the outcome. Dopamine neurons played a causal role only after outcome, when they encoded reward prediction errors graded by confidence, influencing subsequent choices. These results reveal neural signals that combine reward value with sensory confidence and guide subsequent learning."
https://openalex.org/W2995812222,"Macrocycles made easy Macrocycles, which are molecules with large rings of 12 or more atoms, are challenging to produce by intramolecular cyclization because floppy ends tend to join up with another molecule rather than fold back on themselves. Girvin et al. identified a foldamer—a short, structured peptide—that can cyclize floppy, dialdehyde substrates through a templated aldol condensation (see the Perspective by Gutiérrez Collar and Gulder). Variation of the residues within the foldamer suggests that its helical structure helps position amine functional groups crucial for catalysis. The authors prepared molecules with a wide range of ring sizes and developed a synthesis for robustol, a macrocycle natural product with a 22-member ring.

https://openalex.org/W2994710688,"Tissue homeostasis requires the balance of growth by cell production and regression through cell loss. In the hair cycle, during follicle regression, the niche traverses the skin through an unknown mechanism to reach the stem cell reservoir and trigger new growth. Here, we identify the dermal sheath that lines the follicle as the key driver of tissue regression and niche relocation through the smooth muscle contractile machinery that generates centripetal constriction force. We reveal that the calcium-calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase pathway controls sheath contraction. When this pathway is blocked, sheath contraction is inhibited, impeding follicle regression and niche relocation. Thus, our study identifies the dermal sheath as smooth muscle that drives follicle regression for reuniting niche and stem cells in order to regenerate tissue structure during homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2995248183,"Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase capable of countering age-related neurodegeneration, but the basis of Sirt1 neuroprotection remains elusive. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited CAG-polyglutamine repeat disorder. Transcriptome analysis of SCA7 mice revealed downregulation of calcium flux genes accompanied by abnormal calcium-dependent cerebellar membrane excitability. Transcription-factor binding-site analysis of downregulated genes yielded Sirt1 target sites, and we observed reduced Sirt1 activity in the SCA7 mouse cerebellum with NAD+ depletion. SCA7 patients displayed increased poly(ADP-ribose) in cerebellar neurons, supporting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 upregulation. We crossed Sirt1-overexpressing mice with SCA7 mice and noted rescue of neurodegeneration and calcium flux defects. NAD+ repletion via nicotinamide riboside ameliorated disease phenotypes in SCA7 mice and patient stem cell-derived neurons. Sirt1 thus achieves neuroprotection by promoting calcium regulation, and NAD+ dysregulation underlies Sirt1 dysfunction in SCA7, indicating that cerebellar ataxias exhibit altered calcium homeostasis because of metabolic dysregulation, suggesting shared therapy targets."

https://openalex.org/W2995473342,"Background Analysis of circulating tumor nucleic acids in plasma of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients is the most widespread and documented form of ""liquid biopsy"" and provides real-time information on the molecular profile of the tumor without an invasive tissue biopsy. Methods Liquid biopsy analysis was requested by the referral physician in 121 NSCLC patients at diagnosis and was performed using a sensitive Next Generation Sequencing assay. Additionally, a comparative analysis of NSCLC patients at relapse following EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKIs) treatment was performed in 50 patients by both the cobas and NGS platforms. Results At least one mutation was identified in almost 49% of the cases by the NGS approach in NSCLC patients analyzed at diagnosis. In 36 cases with paired tissue available a high concordance of 86.11% was observed for clinically relevant mutations, with a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 88.89%. Furthermore, a concordance rate of 82% between cobas and the NGS approach for the EGFR sensitizing mutations (in exons 18, 19, 21) was observed in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, while this concordance was 94% for the p.T790M mutation, with NGS being able to detect this mutation in three 3 additional patients. Conclusions This study indicates the feasibility of circulating tumor nucleic acids (ctNA) analysis as a tumor biopsy surrogate in clinical practice for NSCLC personalized treatment decision making. The use of new sensitive NGS techniques can reliably detect tumor-derived mutations in liquid biopsy and provide clinically relevant information both before and after targeted treatment in patients with NSCLC. Thus, it could aid physicians in treatment decision making in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W3101207023,"Two-dimensional superfluidity and quantum turbulence are directly connected to the microscopic dynamics of quantized vortices. However, surface effects have prevented direct observations of coherent vortex dynamics in strongly-interacting two-dimensional systems. Here, we overcome this challenge by confining a two-dimensional droplet of superfluid helium at microscale on the atomically-smooth surface of a silicon chip. An on-chip optical microcavity allows laser-initiation of vortex clusters and nondestructive observation of their decay in a single shot. Coherent dynamics dominate, with thermal vortex diffusion suppressed by six orders-of-magnitude. This establishes a new on-chip platform to study emergent phenomena in strongly-interacting superfluids, test astrophysical dynamics such as those in the superfluid core of neutron stars in the laboratory, and construct quantum technologies such as precision inertial sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2996153995,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer. Although most cSCCs have good prognosis, a subgroup of high-risk cSCC has a higher frequency of recurrence and mortality. Therefore, the identification of molecular risk factors associated with this aggressive subtype is of major interest. In this work we carried out a global-scale approach to investigate the DNA-methylation profile in patients at different stages, from premalignant actinic keratosis to low-risk invasive and high-risk non-metastatic and metastatic cSCC. The results showed massive non-sequential changes in DNA-methylome and identified a minimal methylation signature that discriminates between stages. Importantly, a direct comparison of low-risk and high-risk stages revealed epigenetic traits characteristic of high-risk tumours. Finally, a prognostic prediction model in cSCC patients identified a methylation signature able to predict the overall survival of patients. Thus, the analysis of DNA-methylation in cSCC revealed changes during the evolution of the disease through the different stages that can be of great value not only in the diagnosis but also in the prognosis of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2995443246,"Background Birth asphyxia is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality in developing nations, such as Ethiopia. Though Ethiopia has made considerable achievement in the reduction of under-five mortality rate, the neonatal mortality burden has not experienced the same reduction, which may be attributed to birth asphyxia. Thus, this study attempts to assess the prevalence and associated factors of birth asphyxia among newborns in public hospitals in the northeastern Amhara region, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 357 births from 1st April to 2nd May 2018. The sample size was proportionally allocated to randomly selected three public hospitals namely, Dessie referral hospital, Debre Berhan referral hospital, and Woldia general hospital. The allocation was made by taking the average number of deliveries given in each hospital six months before the data collection period. Using the delivery registration of hospitals a systematic random sampling technique was used to get all study participants. The diagnosis of birth asphyxia was confirmed based on the physician’s diagnosis of an APGAR score < 7 in the 1st and 5th minutes of birth. A pretested and structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables with p-values < 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis. A statistical significant level was declared at a p-value of <0.05. Results The prevalence of birth asphyxia was found to occur 22.6% of the time [95% CI 19.2% - 26.4%] in the first minute of birth. In the multivariable logistic regression being primipara [AOR = 3.77: 95% CI 1.86, 7.65], presented with complicated labor [AOR = 3.45: 95% CI 1.58, 7.49], premature rupture of membrane [AOR = 3.85: 95% CI 1.76, 8.44) and having blood-stained amniotic fluid at birth [AOR = 5.02: 95% CI 1.69, 14.87] were the independent predictors of birth asphyxia. Conclusion The study revealed that birth asphyxia is a common newborn complication in the Amhara region. Integrated mitigation measure to reduce neonatal mortality in the Amahar region should give due attention to primipara women and for these high-risk pregnancies in order for the region to achieve national and global commitment to have sustainable change in women and neonatal health."
https://openalex.org/W2995465599,"Current models of word-production in Broca’s area (i.e. left ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, VLPFC) posit that sequential and staggered semantic, lexical, phonological and articulatory processes precede articulation. Using millisecond-resolution intra-cranial recordings, we evaluated spatiotemporal dynamics and high frequency functional interconnectivity between left VLPFC regions during single-word production. Through the systematic variation of retrieval, selection, and phonological loads, we identified specific activation profiles and functional coupling patterns between these regions that fit within current psycholinguistic theories of word production. However, network interactions underpinning these processes activate in parallel (not sequentially), while the processes themselves are indexed by specific changes in network state. We found evidence that suggests that pars orbitalis is coupled with pars triangularis during lexical retrieval, while lexical selection is terminated via coupled activity with M1 at articulation onset. Taken together, this work reveals that speech production relies on very specific inter-regional couplings in rapid sequence in the language dominant hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2995830030,"Changes to arm swing and gait symmetry are symptomatic of several pathological gaits associated with reduced stability. The purpose of this study was to examine the relative contributions of arm swing and gait symmetry towards gait stability. We theorized that actively increasing arm swing would increase gait stability, while asymmetric walking would decrease gait stability. Fifteen healthy, young adults (23.4 ± 2.8 yrs) walked on a split-belt treadmill under symmetric (1.2 m/s) and asymmetric walking (left/right, 5:4 speed ratio) with three different arm swings: held, normal, and active. Trunk local dynamic stability, inter-limb coordination, and spatiotemporal gait variability and symmetry were measured. Active arm swing resulted in improved local trunk stability, increased gait variability, and decreased inter-limb coordination (p < .013). The changes in local trunk stability and gait variability during active arm swing suggests that these metrics quantify fundamentally different aspects of stability and are not always comparable. Split-belt walking caused reduced local trunk stability, increased gait variability, and increased lower limb asymmetry (p < .003). However, the arm swing symmetry was unaffected by gait asymmetry, this suggests that the decreases in gait stability are linked to the increases in gait asymmetry rather than increases in arm swing asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2995762060,"Human ATG8 family proteins (ATG8s) are active in all steps of the macroautophagy pathway, and their lipidation is essential for autophagosome formation. Lipidated ATG8s anchored to the outer surface of the phagophore serve as scaffolds for binding of other core autophagy proteins and various effector proteins involved in trafficking or fusion events, whereas those at the inner surface are needed for assembly of selective autophagy substrates. Their scaffolding role depends on specific interactions between the LC3-interacting region (LIR) docking site (LDS) in ATG8s and LIR motifs in various interaction partners. LC3B is phosphorylated at Thr-50 within the LDS by serine/threonine kinase (STK) 3 and STK4. Here, we identified LIR motifs in STK3 and atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) and never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase 9 (NEK9). All three kinases phosphorylated LC3B Thr-50 in vitro . A phospho-mimicking substitution of Thr-50 impaired binding of several LIR-containing proteins, such as ATG4B, FYVE, and coiled-coil domain-containing 1 (FYCO1), and autophagy cargo receptors p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and neighbor of BRCA1 gene (NBR1). NEK9 knockdown or knockout enhanced degradation of the autophagy receptor and substrate p62. Of note, the suppression of p62 degradation was mediated by NEK9-mediated phosphorylation of LC3B Thr-50. Consistently, reconstitution of LC3B-KO cells with the phospho-mimicking T50E variant inhibited autophagic p62 degradation. PKCζ knockdown did not affect autophagic p62 degradation, whereas STK3/4 knockouts inhibited autophagic p62 degradation independently of LC3B Thr-50 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that NEK9 suppresses LC3B-mediated autophagy of p62 by phosphorylating Thr-50 within the LDS of LC3B."

The outcome measure quality of life was assessed with the Qualidem. Predictors examined were demographic factors, cognition, mood, behavioral problems, and comorbid conditions.Linear mixed regression analyses showed that all nine domains of quality of life showed independent (negative) associations with either depression, agitation, apathy, or a combination of these predictors. Agitation, apathy, depression, and the presence of neurological disease explained 50% of the variance in total quality of life. Male gender, psychiatric/mood disorders, and having one or more comorbid conditions was associated with worse social relations, while the presence of comorbid neurological diseases was associated with more social isolation and a worse care relationship. The presence of endocrine/metabolic disorders and pulmonary disorders was associated with less restless tense behavior.Different domains of quality of life showed different associations, confirming the multidimensionality of quality of life in nursing home residents with dementia. Quality of life is independently associated with mood and behavioral problems, comorbid conditions, and gender. This knowledge may help to identify older persons at risk of a lower quality of life, and to offer targeted interventions to improve quality of life.Dutch Trial registration NTR5641."

By investigating crowdfunding in Canadian organ transplantation, this study aimed to increase understanding of the motivations and outcomes of organ transplantation crowdfunding. Canadian liver and kidney transplantation campaigns posted to GoFundMe between May 30 & 31 2018 were identified and after exclusion, 258 kidney and 171 liver campaigns were included in study. These campaigns were coded for: worthiness of the campaign recipient, requested financial and non-monetary contributions, how monetary donations would be spent, and comments on the Canadian health system, among others. Results suggest Canadian organ donors, transplant candidates, recipients, and their families and caregivers experience significant financial difficulties not addressed by the public health system. Living and medication costs, transportation and relocation expenses, and income loss were the expenses most commonly highlighted by campaigners. Liver campaigns raised nearly half their goal while kidney campaigns received 11.5% of their requested amount. Findings highlight disease burden and the use of crowdfunding as a response to the extraordinary costs associated with organ transplantation. Although crowdfunding reduces some financial burden, it does not do so equitably and raises ethical concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2995213098,"Estradiol is an important sex steroid hormone that is involved in the regulation of crustacean ovarian development. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms of estradiol on ovarian development are largely unknown. This study performed transcriptome sequencing of ovary, hepatopancreas, brain ganglion, eyestalk, and mandibular organ of crabs after estradiol treatment (0.1μg g-1 crab weight). A total of 23, 806 genes were annotated, and 316, 1300, 669, 142, 383 genes were expressed differently in ovary, hepatopancreas, brain ganglion, eyestalk, and mandibular organ respectively. Differentially expressed gene enrichment analysis revealed several crucial pathways including protein digestion and absorption, pancreatic secretion, insect hormone biosynthesis, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450 and signal transduction pathway. Through this study, some key genes in correlation with the ovarian development and nutrition metabolism were significantly affected by estradiol, such as vitelline membrane outer layer 1-like protein, heat shock protein 70, Wnt5, JHE-like carboxylesterase 1, cytochrome P302a1, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, neuropeptide F2, trypsin, carboxypeptidase B, pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase-like, and lipid storage droplet protein. Moreover, RT-qPCR validation demonstrated that expression of transcripts related to ovarian development (vitelline membrane outer layer 1-like protein and cytochrome P302a1) and nutrition metabolism (trypsin, glucose dehydrogenase and lipid storage droplet protein) were significantly affected by estradiol treatment. This study not only has identified relevant genes and several pathways that are involved in estradiol regulation on ovarian development of P. trituberculatus, but also provided new insight into the understanding of the molecular function mechanisms of estradiol in crustacean."
https://openalex.org/W2996194551,"It has been suggested that manipulation of gut microbiota using antibiotics can inhibit colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) in a mouse model. We investigated whether timing of gut microbial manipulation using antibiotics affects colon tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CAC model. CAC was induced in C57BL/6 mice by injection of 12.5 mg/kg AOM followed by three rounds of 1.7% DSS exposure. There were six groups based on timing of antibiotic administration. Colonic inflammation, proliferation, and tumorigenesis were evaluated after animal sacrifice. High-throughput sequencing of the mice feces was performed to characterize changes in gut microbiota. Full-time antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the number and size of tumors, histological scores, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to the AOM/DSS group without antibiotic treatment. The early and late antibiotic groups, antibiotic administration from the first and second rounds of DSS to the end of the study, showed significantly lower histological scores and tumor burden. In contrast, the pretreatment antibiotic group, antibiotic administration from 3 weeks prior to AOM to the first round of DSS, did not exhibit decreased tumorigenesis. Principal coordinate analysis showed similar gut microbial community structures among the full-time, early, and late antibiotic groups, whereas other groups showed distinct gut microbial profiles. There was a positive correlation between number of tumors and number of operational taxonomic units. Colonic tumorigenesis was attenuated by antibiotic administration, except for that only prior to DSS administration, suggesting that gut microbial changes should be maintained throughout the entire period of inflammation to suppress tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2994663647,"For four decades, theories of job demand-control have proposed that higher occupational status groups have lower health risks due to the stress accompanying jobs featuring high demands but high control. This research examines whether Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can improve the health prospects of a range of workers by giving greater control over work time arrangements. Our setting is Australia, where FWAs were introduced in 2009. In line with these early studies alongside studies of work-life balance, we expected to observe that workers with access to control over daily work times could better control the activities outside of work that influence chronic disease. Using a practice sociology approach, we compared the accounts of twenty-eight workers in blue and white collar industries with differing degrees of work time flexibility. The findings do not contradict early theories describing occupational differences of job demand-control dynamics and their relationship to health risks. However, this study suggests that a) time demands and strains have increased for a broad sweep of workers since the 1980s, b) the greater control of higher occupational status groups has been eroded by the high performance movement, which has attracted less scrutiny than FWAs, and c) more workers are forced to adapt their daily lives, including their approach to health, to accommodate their job demands. Job insecurity further impedes preventative health practices adoption. What might appear to be worker-controlled flexibility can—under the pressures of job insecurity and performance expectations without time limits—transform into health-eroding unpredictability. The answer however is not greater flexibility in the absence of limits on the well-documented precursors of work stress: long hours, job insecurity and intensity-related exhaustion. While there have been welcome developments in job demand-control-health conceptualizations, they typically ignore the out-of-work temporal demands that workers face and which compound on-the-job demands. Redesign of the temporalities of working life within worksites need to be accompanied by society-level policies which address caring responsibilities, gender equality as well as broad labour market conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2995748378,"The aim of our study was a quasi-experimental estimation of the relationship between sports activity and social capital, and an assessment made at an individual level of the impact of sports activity on health, beliefs and the social situation of Polish adults. Matching estimation method and Social Diagnosis data were used. The dataset enables not only an analysis of the self-reported health, but also of social capital. The panel structure of the data and the applied method allow for stratifying the sample using past characteristics, including past sports activity, as well as for assessing outcomes after the treatment-engaging in sports activity-takes place. Both allow for an interpretation of the results as reflections of a causal relationship. Even though publications applying matching estimation or IV estimation to assess the impact of sports activity have recently been increasing in number, ours is the first to concentrate on the effects on multidimensional social capital for adults using panel data and matching estimation. It is also the first to focus on a country that is neither one of the most developed in the world or one of the least developed. The results obtained suggest significant heterogeneity in terms of age, gender and place of living. We also found that sports contributed to building social networks and being socially active. Our research indicates that sports activity enhances social health. It can be used as a tool for a policy of social activation and strengthening the health potential of adults, especially those over 40."
https://openalex.org/W2996750909,"Background Indonesia has been shifting from ensuring access to health services towards improving service quality. Accreditation has been used as quality assurance (QA) mechanism, first in hospitals and subsequently in primary health care facilities, including Puskesmas (community health centres). QA provides measures of whether services meet quality targets, but quality improvement (QI) is needed to make change and achieve improvements. QI is a cyclical process with cycles of problem identification, solution testing and observation. We investigated the factors which influenced the process of QI based on experience of maternal health QI teams in three Puskesmas in Cianjur district, West Java province, Indonesia. Methods Qualitative data were collected using 28 in-depth interviews at two points of time: pre- (April 2016) and post- QI intervention (April 2017), involving national, provincial, district and Puskesmas managers; and Puskesmas QI team members. Thematic analysis of transcripts was conducted. Results We found four main factors contributed to the process of QI: 1) leadership, including awareness and attitude of leader(s) towards QI, involvement of leader(s) in the QI process and decision-making in budget allocation for QI; 2) staff enthusiasm and multidisciplinary collaboration; 3) a culture where QI is integrated in existing responsibilities; and 4) the ongoing Puskesmas accreditation process, which increased the value of QI to the organisation. Conclusion Making QI a success in the decentralised Indonesian system requires action at four levels. At individual level, leadership attributes can create an internal quality environment and drive organisational cultural change. At team level, staff enthusiasm and collaboration can be triggered through engaging and tasking everyone in the QI process and having a shared vision of what quality should look like. At organisational level, QI should be integrated in planned activities, ensuring financial and human resources. Lastly, QI can be encouraged when it is implemented by the wider health system as part of national accreditation programmes."

However, recent studies have linked it with cases of mastitis in cows. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) is a bioactive compound with pharmacological functions including antibacterial activity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ISL on S. xylosus in vitro and in vivo. The MIC of ISL against S. xylosus was 80 μg/mL. It was observed that sub-MICs of ISL (1/2MIC, 1/4MIC, 1/8MIC) significantly inhibited the formation of S. xylosus biofilm in vitro. Previous studies have observed that inhibiting imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase (IGPD) concomitantly inhibited biofilm formation in S. xylosus. So, we designed experiments to target the formation of IGPD or inhibits its activities in S. xylosus ATCC 700404. The results indicated that the activity of IGPD and its histidine content decreased significantly under 1/2 MIC (40 μg/mL) ISL, and the expression of IGPD gene (hisB) and IGPD protein was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, Bio-layer interferometry experiments showed that ISL directly interacted with IGPD protein (with strong affinity; KD = 234 μM). In addition, molecular docking was used to predict the binding mode of ISL and IGPD. In vivo tests revealed that, ISL significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels, mitigated the destruction of the mammary glands and reversed the production of inflammatory cells in mice. The results of the study suggest that, ISL may inhibit S. xylosus growth by acting on IGPD, which can be used as a target protein to treat infections caused by S. xylosus."

In the present study, we isolate and identify the fungus Chrysosporium multifidum from the gut of Hermetia illucens larvae. Extract from C. multifidum culture broth supernatant showed moderate activity against a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Bioguided isolation of the extract resulted in the characterization of six α-pyrone derivatives (1–6) and one diketopiperazine (7). Of these compounds, 5,6-dihydro-4-methoxy-6-(1-oxopentyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (4) showed the greatest activity (IC50 = 11.4 ± 0.7 μg/mL and MIC = 62.5 μg/mL) against MRSA."
https://openalex.org/W2996423507,"Soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are important soil properties linked to nutrient limitation and plant productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Up to 90% of the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China has been affected by soil salination due to groundwater overdraft, improper irrigation, land use and land cover change. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of different plant communities on soil quality in a saline-alkaline system of the YRD. We investigated the vertical distribution and seasonal variation of soil C, N, and P, and C:N ratio by choosing four dominant plant communities, namely, alfalfa grassland (AG), Chinese tamarisk (CT), locust forest (LF) and cotton field (CF). The results showed that the concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in CT and LF were always higher than that in AG and CF, especially in the topsoil layer (p<0.05), then gradually decreased with soil depth increasing (p<0.05). The C:N ratio was generally lower, and the average C:N ratio was higher in LF (11.55±1.99) and CT (11.03±0.47) than in CF (10.05±1.25) and AG (9.11±1.11) (p<0.05). The available phosphorus (AP) was highest in CT in Spring, while it was highest in CF in Summer and Autumn. It is worth noting that the soil AP concentrations were always low, particularly in AG (< 6.29 mg kg-1) and LF (< 4.67 mg kg-1), probably linked to P poorly mobile in the saline-alkaline region. In this study, soil nutrients in natural plant communities are superior to farmland, and are significantly affected by the types of plant community; therefore, we suggest that protection of natural vegetation and development of optimal vegetation are critical to restoring land degradation in the YRD."
https://openalex.org/W2994872406,"The high respiration rates of the deep-sea benthos cannot be sustained by known carbon supply pathways alone. Here, we investigate moderately-sized reptilian food falls as a potential alternative carbon pathway. Specifically, three individual carcasses of Alligator mississippiensis were deployed along the continental slope of the northern Gulf of Mexico at depths of ~2000m in early 2019. We posit the tough hide of alligators would impeded scavengers by limiting access to soft tissues of the alligator fall. However, the scavengers began consuming the food fall 43 hours post-deployment for one individual (198.2cm, 29.7kg), and the carcass of another individual (175.3 cm, 19.5kg) was completely devoid of soft tissue at 51 days post-deployment. A third individual (172.7cm, 18.5kg) was missing completely after 8 days, with only the deployment harness and weight remaining drug 8 meters away, suggesting a large elasmobranch scavenger. Additionally, bones recovered post-deployment reveal the first observations of the bone-eating Osedax in the Gulf of Mexico and are confirmed here as new to science. The findings of this study indicate the quick and successful utilization of terrestrial and aquatic-based carbon food sources in the deep marine environment, though outcome variability may be high."
https://openalex.org/W2995073503,"Age-period-cohort analysis of incidence and/or mortality data has received much attention in the literature. To circumvent the non-identifiability problem inherent in the age-period-cohort model, additional constraints are necessary on the parameters estimates. We propose setting the constraint to reflect the different nature of the three temporal variables: age, period, and birth cohort. There are two assumptions in our method. Recognizing age effects to be deterministic (first assumption), we do not explicitly incorporate the age parameters into constraint. For the stochastic period and cohort effects, we set a constant-relative-variation constraint on their trends (second assumption). The constant-relative-variation constraint dictates that between two stochastic effects, one with a larger curvature gets a larger (absolute) slope, and one with zero curvature gets no slope. We conducted Monte-Carlo simulations to examine the statistical properties of the proposed method and analyzed the data of prostate cancer incidence for whites from 1973-2012 to illustrate the methodology. A driver for the period and/or cohort effect may be lacking in some populations. In that case, the CRV method automatically produces an unbiased age effect and no period and/or cohort effect, thereby addressing the situation properly. However, the method proposed in this paper is not a general purpose model and will produce biased results in many other real-life data scenarios. It is only useful in situations when the age effects are deterministic and dominant, and the period and cohort effects are stochastic and minor."
https://openalex.org/W2995787451,"Exploration of diverse environmental samples for plant growth-promoting microbes to fulfill the increasing demand for sustainable agriculture resulted in increased use of bacterial biofertilizer. We aimed for the isolation of plant growth-promoting as well as antibiotic sensitive bacteria from bovine manure samples. The basic theme of our study is to highlight potentials of bacteria in manure and the unchecked risk associated with the application of manure i.e. introducing antibiotic-resistant microbial flora, as fertilizer. Fifty-two, morphologically distinct isolates; from eight different manure samples, were subjected to plant growth-promoting parametric tests along with antibiotic resistance. Thirteen antibiotic sensitive bacterial strains with potentials of plant growth promotion further characterized by 16S rRNA ribotyping and the identified genera were Stenotrophomonas, Achromobacter, Pseudomonas, and Brevibacillus. Successful radish seeds germination under sterile in-vitro conditions showed the potential of selected bacterial isolates as plant growth-promoting bacteria. The results of this study confirmed plant growth-promoting characteristics of bovine manures' bacterial strains along with an alarming antibiotic resistance load which comprises 75% of bacterial isolated population. Our study showed distinct results of un-explored manure bacterial isolates for plant growth promotion and flagged ways associated with unchecked manure application in agriculture soil through high load of antibiotic resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2995064856,"Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used in spatial prioritization for biodiversity conservation (e.g. selecting conservation areas). However, it is unclear whether ENMs are always beneficial for such purposes. We quantified the benefit of using ENMs in conservation prioritization, comparing the numbers of species covered by conservation areas selected on the basis of probabilities estimated by ENMs (ENM approach) and those selected on the basis of raw observation data (raw-data approach), while controlling survey range, survey bias, and target size of conservation area. We evaluated three ENM algorithms (GLM, GAM, and random forests). We used virtual community data generated by simulation for the evaluation. ENM approach was effective when survey bias is strong, survey range is narrow, and target size of conservation area is moderate. The percentage of cases in which the ENM approach outperformed the raw-data approach ranged from 0.0 to 33% (GLM), 31% (GAM), and 75% (random forests) depending on conditions. The number of rare species (< 20 presence records) included in the conservation area based on the ENM approach was less than, or the same as, that of the raw-data approach. The unexpectedly limited cases in which the ENM approach was effective in the present research may depend on the conservation target we used (to cover as many species as possible in conservation area). Our results highlight urgent need for evaluating ENM’s effectiveness under other conservation targets for wise use of ENM in conservation prioritization."
https://openalex.org/W2996547717,"This study examined postoperative heart failure (HF) and respiratory failure (RF) complications and related healthcare utilization for one year following cardiac surgery.This study identified adult patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve procedures from the Cerner Health Facts® database. It included patients experiencing postoperative HF or RF complications. We quantified healthcare utilization using the frequency of inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED) visits with or without hospital admission, and outpatient visits. We then determined direct hospital costs from the determined healthcare utilization. We analyzed trends over time for both HF and RF and evaluated the association between surgery type and HF complication.Of 10,298 patients with HF complications, 1,714 patients (16.6%) developed persistent HF; of the 10,385 RF patients, 175 (1.7%) developed persistent RF. Healthcare utilization for those with persistent complications over the one-year period following index hospital discharge comprised an average number of the following visit types: Inpatient (1.49 HF; 1.55 RF), Outpatient (2.02, 0.51), ED without hospital admission (0.33, 0.13), ED + Inpatient (0.08, 0.06). Per patient annual costs related to persistent complications of HF and RF were $20,857 and $30,745, respectively. There was a significant association between cardiac surgical type and the incidence of HF, with risk for isolated valve procedures (adjusted OR 2.60; 95% CI: 2.35-2.88) and CABG + valve procedures (adjusted OR 2.38; 95% CI: 2.17-2.61) exceeding risk for isolated CABG procedures.This study demonstrates that HF and RF complication rates post cardiac surgery are substantial, and complication-related healthcare utilization over the first year following surgery results in significant incremental costs. Given the need for both payers and providers to focus on healthcare cost reduction, this study fills an important gap in quantifying the mid-term economic impact of postoperative cardiac surgical complications."
https://openalex.org/W2996344571,"As the root cause of illegal cyber activities, botnets are evolving continuously over the last two decades. Current researches on botnet command and control mechanism based on blockchain network suffer from high economic cost, single point of failure, and limited scalability. In this paper, we present DUSTBot, a novel P2P botnet model based on Bitcoin transactions to prepare for new cyber threats. Specifically, a covert, duplex, and low-cost command and control (C&C) channel in the Bitcoin network is presented in our work. DUSTBot uses the Bitcoin main network as the downstream channel while using the Bitcoin testnet as the upstream channel. Furthermore, the peer list exchange algorithm based on the Ethereum block hash proposed in this paper is effective against routing table poisoning attack and P2P botnet crawling. The robustness of DUSTBot against node removal is studied through constructing the botnet with a P2P simulator. We deploy the implementation of DUSTBot on cloud platforms to test its feasibility and performance. Moreover, the stealthiness of DUSTBot and the effectiveness of the proposed peer list exchange algorithm are evaluated. The results demonstrate the feasibility, performance, stealthiness, and robustness of DUSTBot. In the end, possible countermeasures are discussed to mitigate similar threats in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2994750888,"Plasmodium vivax is the leading cause of malaria outside Africa and represents a significant health and economic burden on affected countries. A major obstacle for P. vivax eradication is the dormant hypnozoite liver stage that causes relapse infections and the limited antimalarial drugs that clear this stage. Advances in studying the hypnozoite and other unique biological aspects of this parasite are hampered by the lack of a continuous in vitro laboratory culture system and poor availability of molecular tools for genetic manipulation. In this study, we aim to develop molecular tools that can be used for genetic manipulation of P. vivax. A putative P. vivax centromere sequence (PvCEN) was cloned and episomal centromere based plasmids expressing a GFP marker were constructed. Centromere activity was evaluated using a rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii. A plasmid carrying PvCEN was stably maintained in asexual-stage parasites in the absence of drug pressure, and approximately 45% of the parasites retained the plasmid four weeks later. The same retention rate was observed in parasites possessing a native P. yoelii centromere (PyCEN)-based control plasmid. The segregation efficiency of the plasmid per nuclear division was > 99% in PvCEN parasites, compared to ~90% in a control parasite harboring a plasmid without a centromere. In addition, we observed a clear GFP signal in both oocysts and salivary gland sporozoites isolated from mosquitoes. In blood-stage parasites after liver stage development, GFP positivity in PvCEN parasites was comparable to control PyCEN parasites. Thus, PvCEN plasmids were maintained throughout the parasite life cycle. We also validated several P. vivax promoter activities and showed that hsp70 promoter (~1 kb) was active throughout the parasite life cycle. This is the first data for the functional characterization of a P. vivax centromere that can be used in future P. vivax biological research."

Methods Mice subjected to transection of the medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments and meniscotomy (osteoarthritis model) or to a sham procedure, as well as non-operated (naive) mice and rats, had knee joints excised. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). CD68+ cells, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression were detected using immunohistochemistry. Results Lamellar ossified areas, bone-entrapped osteocytes and bone marrow spaces were found inside menisci of one week up to 6 months-old naïve mice, regardless of gender. Menisci from naive rats also showed the same pattern with bone marrow areas. CD68+ cells were identified in bone marrow areas inside the meniscus of mice. TRAP+ osteoclasts, and hematogenous precursors expressing IL-1β, TNF, and iNOS were identified inside bone marrow areas in meniscal samples from both naïve and sham operated mice. Quantitative immunoexpression of IL-1 β, TNF and iNOS was more intense, P = 0.0194, 0.0293, 0.0124, respectively, in mouse knees from mice sacrificed 49 days after being subjected to an osteoarthritis (OA) model as compared to sham operated animals.

Our study has four main findings. 1) People who choose high violence report greater satisfaction with the story, while those switching to or staying with no violence show lower satisfaction. 2) However, when participants encounter these stories without choices, they reliably rate higher-violence stories as less satisfying than lower-violence stories. 3) Regret seems to account for the low satisfaction of those who choose or switch to low violence. 4) There is a large segment of people (up to 66%) who can be persuaded by different story contexts (genre, perspective) to choose extreme violence in interactive fiction and as a consequence of their choice feel satisfaction. We hypothesize that people who opt for high violence enjoy the story as a result of their choice. Overall, we suggest that choosing violence serves as a gateway for enjoyment by creating an aesthetic zone of control detached from morality."

A few minutes in, the students looked tired, distracted, and in no mood to listen—a stark contrast to my research talk audiences, which seemed attentive at least. At one point, I noticed a few students giggling. “Do I look or talk funny?” I wondered. When I saw that the giggling students were on Facebook, I was relieved. But later I realized that, too, was a sign that I had failed to command their attention.

> “Actively engaging students is essential for holding their attention.” 

In grad school, I had served as a teaching assistant, helping guide undergraduate students during hands-on lab sessions. But I was never responsible for teaching a class on my own, and I never had any formal training.

When I became a faculty member, I had to take on a daunting course load, teaching 50 lectures and as many labs per semester. It felt as though I'd been dropped in the deep end of a pool with no swimming lessons. Class by class, my doubts about my teaching abilities mounted, along with my fears that students were not absorbing the key details in my lectures.

I started to reflect on my own experiences as a student and tried to recall the things that helped me learn, as well as the things that didn't. The researcher in me also began to search for scientific evidence to guide me. I sought help from experts in pedagogy, as well as colleagues who had more teaching experience than I did. They told me about tools that they used during lectures and resources on campus for new teachers.

Within 1 year, there was a marked change in my teaching. I began to use new skills and tools that kept my students engaged. One student wrote in a teaching evaluation that my approach to teaching “made the information exciting” and “challenged students to pay attention.” Teaching gradually became a source of satisfaction rather than anxiety.

Here are some of the lessons that have helped me become a more effective teacher.

SEEK HELP. Teaching is a skill and as such needs to be learned. Many scientists assume that their graduate degree or postdoctoral experience qualifies them to be a teacher. The reality is far from that. Most universities have support systems for new teachers, but it is usually up to the instructor to actively seek help. I'd recommend taking formal university courses on teaching methods and participating in workshops. They can help you build networks with fellow educators, swap ideas, and share challenges.

KEEP IT INTERACTIVE. Actively engaging students is essential for holding their attention and nurturing critical thought. In a small class, asking students to partner with a classmate to brainstorm an answer to a question can help keep them focused. Then, you can bring everyone together and ask the students to share their ideas. Bigger classes pose a greater challenge, but there, too, the right tools can help engage students. For instance, you can ask multiple choice questions and use electronic clickers to register the students' responses. Or you can tell the students to pass a soft toy around the classroom, each taking a turn to ask or answer a question when the toy comes to them.

BE COMPASSIONATE. Students are more likely to learn if they feel the teacher genuinely cares about them and respects them. So treat every student with understanding and compassion, and make it clear to them that they can come to you for help. It is also important to be mindful of the diversity in student backgrounds and approaches to learning. Some students may not feel comfortable raising their hand in lecture, for instance, so I use an anonymous Google document where they can leave questions for me.

Teaching isn't always easy or intuitive, but it's your responsibility to help your students learn. Put in the time to create an environment that maximizes learning for everyone.
